Yusuke Aida was on a television commercial for Nescafé and it seems to have entered the vocabulary at about that time when <b>his</b> nerikomi <b>coffee</b> <b>cups</b> were available to the first people contacting the advertisers.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2006, {{following}} Vice-President Dick Cheney's well-publicized hunting mishap, {{in which}} he accidentally shot a fellow hunter, Jacobson criticized Cheney for not speaking publicly about the incident. Walter proclaimed in his commentary, [...] "I'm after you, Dick Cheney!" [...] and later [...] "You can't hide in the White House forever, I'll be waiting outside", while flaunting <b>his</b> portable <b>coffee</b> <b>cup</b> at a good moment {{to show that he}} would be comfortable and relaxed with a warm drink while outside the White House.|$|R
50|$|Other {{eyewitness}} accounts from survivors indicate that Dorman was tortured {{by a group}} of women who pounded him with stone hammers, slashed him repeatedly with knives, and shot his legs full of buckshot. One odd detail reported is that <b>his</b> <b>coffee</b> pot and <b>cup</b> were filled with blood. A report that he had been 'sliced open' may be a translator's error; near his body was that of one of the Ree (Arikara) scouts, which had been slashed open and a willow branch stuck in the opening. To the Indians, mutilations were characteristic of different tribes and particular marks meant certain things. As for the torture, the Indians considered him a traitor who had fought with the bluecoats against them.|$|R
60|$|He {{pushed away}} <b>his</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>cup</b> {{and drew a}} pocket-book from his inner breast-pocket. From {{the depths of the}} pocket-book he {{produced}} an envelope, and from the envelope he extracted a letter, closely written in a small, neat handwriting.|$|E
60|$|Tom chuckled, {{but held}} the peace by hiding {{his face in}} <b>his</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>cup.</b> Sarah, though checked by this flank attack, was herself an old hand in the art. So {{temporary}} was the setback that she scarcely paused ere hurling her assault from a new angle.|$|E

Bjornstam told his scapes: selling horses in a Montana mining-camp, breaking a log-jam, being impertinent to a [...] "two-fisted" [...] millionaire lumberman. Bea gurgled [...] "Oh my!" [...] and kept <b>his</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>cup</b> filled.|$|E

5000|$|However, the {{predicate}} of {{a universal}} affirmative claim won't really fit any of these models. All <b>coffee</b> <b>cups</b> are cups does not imply All <b>coffee</b> <b>cups</b> are this <b>cup,</b> or all <b>coffee</b> <b>cups</b> are that cup, or ..., but still less does it imply All <b>coffee</b> <b>cups</b> are this <b>cup,</b> and all <b>coffee</b> <b>cups</b> are that cup, and .... On the other hand, if {{it happened to be}} the case that there was only one <b>coffee</b> <b>cup</b> left in the world, it would be true that All <b>coffee</b> <b>cups</b> are that cup, so I can validly infer from All <b>coffee</b> <b>cups</b> are that <b>cup,</b> to All <b>coffee</b> <b>cups</b> are cups. Here descent to disjunction fails, and descent to conjunction fails, but [...] "ascent from particulars" [...] is valid. This is called [...] "merely confused supposition." ...|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Hoopdriver {{helped the}} eggs and then, instead of beginning, sat with his cheek on his hand, {{watching}} Jessie pour out the coffee. His ears were a bright red, and his eyes bright. He took <b>his</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>cup</b> clumsily, cleared his throat, suddenly leant back in his chair, and thrust his hands deep into his pockets. [...] "I'll do it," [...] he said aloud.|$|E
6000|$|She rose up {{from her}} sofa and went and took <b>his</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>cup</b> {{out of his hand}} with a little curtsey. [...] "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I must get a watchdog. But he won't bark at YOU." [...] And, going into the other drawing-room, she sat down to the piano and began to sing little French songs in such a charming, thrilling voice that the mollified nobleman speedily {{followed}} her into that chamber, and might be seen nodding his head and bowing time over her.|$|E

5000|$|Gibbs is a {{habitual}} <b>coffee</b> drinker. When <b>his</b> <b>coffee</b> is spilled {{or someone}} else takes and/or drinks it without knowing (this also translates to stolen food that is his), it almost always causes his temper to flare, and he will demand a new one; at least once, however, he has done so simply to haze somebody, newcomer McGee. He even considers coffee the equivalent of breakfast, as seen when he was offered a selection of food from a diner, Abby asked him to at least have something before he left, and Gibbs merely grabbed the <b>coffee</b> <b>cup.</b>|$|R

60|$|Who {{always left}} open doors in cold weather? It was Henry. Who {{was sure to}} upset <b>his</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>cup</b> at breakfast, or to knock over his tumbler at dinner, or to {{prostrate}} saltcellar, pepper box, and mustard pot, if he only happened to move his arm? Why, Henry. Who was plate breaker general for the family? It was Henry. Who tangled mamma's silks and cottons, and tore up the last newspaper for papa, or threw down old Ph[oe]be's clothes horse, with all her clean ironing thereupon? Why, Henry.|$|E
60|$|He took a {{piece of}} sugar from the saucer of <b>his</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>cup</b> and flung it to the {{expectant}} Louisa, who snapped it in mid-air. There was {{a sigh of relief}} from the company; a wolf that ate sugar when it might at the least have been employed in tearing macaws to pieces had already shed some of its terrors. The sigh deepened to a gasp of thanks-giving when Lord Pabham decoyed the animal out of the room by a pretended largesse of further sugar. There was an instant rush to the vacated conservatory. There was no trace of Mrs. Hampton except the plate containing the macaws’ supper.|$|E
60|$|His {{companion}} {{was also}} French, Leblanc by name, {{but of a}} very different stamp. In person he was short and stout. His large head was bald except for a fringe of curling, iron-grey hair which grew round it just above the ears and fell upon his shoulders, giving him {{the appearance of a}} tonsured but dishevelled priest. His eyes were blue and watery, his mouth was rather weak, and his cheeks were pale, full and flabby. When the Heer Marais rose, I, being an observant youth, noted that Monsieur Leblanc took the opportunity to stretch out a rather shaky hand and fill up <b>his</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>cup</b> out of a black bottle, which from the smell I judged to contain peach brandy.|$|E
50|$|A <b>coffee</b> <b>cup</b> {{may also}} be a {{disposable}} cup in which hot beverages, including coffee, can be contained. Disposable <b>coffee</b> <b>cups</b> may be made out of paper or styrofoam. At <b>coffee</b> shops, paper <b>cups</b> are commonly used to give beverages to customers on the go, usually with a <b>coffee</b> <b>cup</b> sleeve to provide insulation against heat transferred through the container.|$|R
5000|$|There is no {{difference}} between props in different media, such as theatre, film, or television.

6000|$|It was half-way {{through the}} morning, {{and he had}} not breakfasted; the slight litter of other breakfasts stood about {{on the table to}} remind him of his hunger; and adding a poached egg to his order, he {{proceeded}} musingly to shake some white sugar into his coffee, thinking all the time about Flambeau. He remembered how Flambeau had escaped, once by a pair of nail scissors, and once by a house on fire; once by having to pay for an unstamped letter, and once by getting people to look through a telescope at a comet that might destroy the world. He thought his detective brain as good as the criminal's, which was true. But he fully realised the disadvantage. [...] "The criminal is the creative artist; the detective only the critic," [...] he said with a sour smile, and lifted <b>his</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>cup</b> to his lips slowly, and put it down very quickly. He had put salt in it.|$|E
6000|$|Her father, it appeared, {{had bought}} the {{ordinary}} shares of a Cuban railway very extensively, on the distinct understanding that they would improve. In a decent universe, with a proper respect for meritorious gentlemen, these shares would have improved accordingly, but the weather had seen fit to shatter the wisdom of Mr. Pope altogether. The sugar crop had collapsed, the bears were at work, and every morning now saw his nominal capital diminished by a dozen pounds or so. I {{do not know what}} Mr. Pope would have done if he had not had his family to help him bear his trouble. As it was he relieved his tension by sending Theodore from the table for dropping a knife, telling Rom when she turned the plate round to pick the largest banana that she hadn't the self-respect of a child of five, and remarking sharply from behind the Times when Daffy asked Marjorie {{if she was going to}} sketch: [...] "Oh, for God's sake don't whisper!" [...] Then when Mrs. Pope came round the table and tried to take <b>his</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>cup</b> softly to refill it without troubling him, he snatched at it, wrenched it roughly out of her hand, and said with his mouth full, and strangely in the manner of a snarling beast: [...] "No' ready yet. Half foo'." ...|$|E

(Although the manufacture {{of some of the}} <b>coffee</b> <b>cups</b> and dinnerware are now outsourced to Spain.) The Wächtersbach Ceramic Factory <b>coffee</b> <b>cups</b> are noted for being superbly designed—they have unusually thick circular porcelain walls that allow them to keep the coffee (or tea or hot chocolate) hot longer than regular <b>coffee</b> <b>cups.</b> They also have larger than normal handles, making them easy to grasp.|$|R
5000|$|The extra footage {{depicts the}} missing {{children}} coming onscreen following each murder, revealing {{themselves to be}} the killers, before suddenly disappearing. Ellison becomes light-headed, and notices a bright green liquid mixed with <b>his</b> <b>coffee</b> in the <b>cup,</b> along with a note reading [...] "Good Night, Daddy" [...] under the cup before losing consciousness. Ashley appears behind Ellison, revealing herself to be the drugger, under Bughuul's possession. Ellison awakens to find himself, Tracy and Trevor bound and gagged {{on the floor of}} the parlour next to the lit fire. Ashley approaches filming him with the 8 mm camera. Ashley then decapitates Ellison with an axe before killing Tracy and Trevor off screen, using their blood to paint images of cats, dogs and unicorns on the walls. Ashley then views the film of her murders while drawing the murder in the lid of the home movies box. The missing children stare at her through the camera, but flee when Bughuul appears. He lifts Ashley into his arms and disappears into the film with her.|$|R

Now, the General {{went straight to the}} bookcase, leaving <b>his</b> <b>cup</b> of <b>coffee</b> on the bookstand {{in the middle of the}} room.

5000|$|A shuttle {{arrived at}} the hotel to pick up Cloyd, Hughes and the flight attendants at 9:30 a.m. However, they had to wait about 20 minutes for Hughes, who entered looking {{somewhat}} disheveled. Flight 556 was scheduled to leave for Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix at 10:38 a.m. When the shuttle arrived at Miami International Airport, the pilots stopped at Starbucks Coffee {{before going to the}} security checkpoint. A security screener asked Cloyd to throw away <b>his</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>cup,</b> but Cloyd refused. When a supervisor was called and {{tried to get him to}} comply, Cloyd responded, [...] "that shit doesn't apply to me." [...] However, Cloyd finally threw away <b>his</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>cup</b> after police were called. Several screeners reported smelling alcohol on the pilots' breath and asked a ground security coordinator to speak with them at the gate. When she noted that there were concerns Cloyd and Hughes were drunk, Cloyd blamed it on bad breath. However, the supervisor had already called the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), who then alerted the police.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{examines}} {{the ways in which}} art and aesthetics provide powerful and rich models for inquiry and connection, facilitating fresh perception, conceptualization, and engagement in qualitative research. The very engagement with research parallels the engagement with the arts. In this engagement, problem setting and problem solving, the conceptual and the embodied, the analytic and the holistic, are interconnected and interdependent. This article discusses a specific pedagogy used in the author’s research courses to develop and nurture this inquiring mindset: a museum activity around consonant and dissonant artworks (‘bounded systems’) that targets the skills of observation and conceptualization, the identification of relevant contexts for inquiry, and the generation of directions for further inquiry. In <b>his</b> article on <b>coffee</b> <b>cups,</b> frogs, and lived experience, Chip (Bruce, 2008) recalls Betsy Hearne and him talking with a doctoral student who was having trouble focusing her research. When Chip and Betsy asked the student to say one word that felt most central to her way of thinking, she turned the table on them with the same question. It was Inquiry for Chip (and Story for Betsy). Inquiry, indeed, is the first word that comes to my mind when thinking of Chip. Inquiry permeates every encounter with Chip, from book club discussions, to dissertation committee...|$|R
