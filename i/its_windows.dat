5|$|In July 1984, Raiford guards {{found two}} hacksaw blades hidden in Bundy's cell. A steel bar {{in one of}} <b>its</b> <b>windows</b> had been sawed {{completely}} through {{at the top and}} bottom and glued back in place with a homemade soap-based adhesive. Several months later his cell was changed again after guards found an unauthorized mirror hidden in it.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{is built}} of, primarily, yellow, but also {{black and red}} {{polished}} tuff. It has three entrances. The main one is on the western side.

5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, {{it is unlikely that the}} pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether <b>its</b> <b>windows</b> are open or closed.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{downtown}} buildings were damaged in a major tornado in March 2008, scattering glass from several hundred feet. It took workers several days to clean the buildings and remove all of the loose shards of glass from the skyscrapers. No structural damage was reported, and by late 2010 each skyscraper had all of <b>its</b> <b>windows</b> replaced. Window blinds and other office objects from the tall buildings were found {{as far away as}} Oakland Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The bank {{building}} was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it {{and made it}} home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of <b>its</b> <b>windows</b> were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it {{was nothing more than}} an empty, roofless, concrete shell.|$|E

5|$|The brick {{church was}} {{constructed}} {{east of the}} original log structure, which was located {{to the west of}} the present community building. The 1849 church was originally topped by a wooden shake roof, and <b>its</b> <b>windows</b> had double-hung wooden sashes. Its pews were built by Alfred Brill, Jacob Himmelwright and Frederick Secrist with lumber milled by Brill. The church was constructed under the ministry of H. J. Richardson (1848–53).|$|E
5|$|The convent, {{which was}} built around 1854, {{was used as the}} central {{residence}} of Jesuit missionaries in Bohol. It was built parallel to the transept and was an unusual three-storey structure, with a two-storey outdoor gallery (called a volada) and thick walls. It is the only convent in the Philippines with three storeys. An extension perpendicular to the convent was built {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. The convent was also adorned with paintings on its walls and ceilings, and with colored glass on <b>its</b> <b>windows</b> and cornices on the kitchen. The roof was replaced with galvanized iron in 1888. The third floor of the convent is now used as an ecclesiastical museum (known as Loboc Museum), containing several religious artifacts, such as a 1786 silver missal and 18th century wooden Santo Niño.|$|E
5|$|The crowd ransacked the Communist Party's local {{headquarters}} {{and then at}} around 11:00am attacked {{the office of the}} Ministry of Public Security on Kochanowskiego Street, but were repulsed when the first shots were fired from <b>its</b> <b>windows</b> into the crowd. From then until 6:00pm, they seized or besieged many government buildings and institutions in and around Poznań, including the district courthouse and the prosecutor's office, radio jamming station in Dąbrowskiego Street, police stations in Junikowo, Wilda, Swarzędz, Puszczykowo and Mosina. The prison camp in Mrowino and the military school at the Poznań University of Technology were seized and weapons were taken. The police documents at local police station, procurature and court were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The manager's {{house was}} built of brick and stucco around 1920. It is two stories high, four bays wide, two bays deep, and has an {{asymmetrical}} plan. The building has a shallow hip roof with exposed rafter ends. <b>Its</b> <b>windows</b> are primarily one-over-one and double-hung with wood trim, with window-sills made of concrete. There is a three-story rectangular brick tower set into the main (west) facade. The tower is open at the top beneath a wide wood fascia. The building has a brick chimney decorated with corbelling; its chimney coping and caps are made of concrete. The building is now rented to the members.|$|E
5|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the destruction of}} the mansion {{as a result of the}} gas explosion, gas mortars were placed in front of the building to create large-scale fireballs. The wave of fire engulfs the camera, and to achieve that effect, gas mortars were used again but were fired upwards into a black ceiling piece that sloped up towards the camera. When the sequence was shot at a high speed, the flames appeared to surge across the ground. For one of the final scenes of the film, the Sandford police station is destroyed by an explosion. Part of the explosion was created by using a set model that showed <b>its</b> <b>windows</b> being blown out, while the building remained intact. The actual destruction of the building was depicted by exploding a miniature model of the station.|$|E
5|$|Wartime Mikkeli is {{identified}} with Marshal Mannerheim, {{the commander of}} the Finnish army and later President of Finland. His personal railway carriage, which he used as a command post during the war, is parked in a siding at Mikkeli station. It is possible to look inside the carriage through <b>its</b> <b>windows</b> at any time. But public entry to the carriage is only permitted once a year, on Mannerheim's birthday (June 4). The carriage was the venue of Mannerheim's famous 1942 meeting (near Immola) with Hitler, on which occasion a private conversation between the two men was secretly recorded. Photographs of this meeting are on display in the carriage. Mannerheim was a regular diner at the Mikkelin Klubi, where his favourite drink was schnapps.|$|E

5|$|While in the U.S., John and his {{siblings}} lived in grandeur and wanted for nothing, but on {{their return to}} England in February 1945 they were faced with the stark realities of wartime Britain. Rationing was still in force, their former home at Cheyne Walk had been bombed, and the house at 22Eaton Square had had <b>its</b> <b>windows</b> blown out. Despite the family's noble ancestry, the 6th Earl {{and his wife were}} agnostics and socialists and preferred a more austere existence than that offered by Tucker, an extremely wealthy Christian. For a time, John suffered nightmares and was taken to a psychotherapist. As an adult he remained an agnostic, but ensured that his children attended Sunday school, preferring to give them a traditional childhood.|$|E
5|$|All Saints' {{originally}} {{consisted of}} a nave and chancel, to which a sanctuary was added in the first building phase. The church was extended on three occasions between the 10th and 14th centuries– a period of population growth– to include an aisled nave, a western tower and a northern chapel; <b>its</b> <b>windows</b> featured stained glass. The church was abandoned in the 15th century, presumably because the parish could no longer support two churches. It was demolished, and virtually all of its masonry removed, {{some of which may}} have been used in improvements to the church of St Nicholas. The settlement of Shuart remained as an area of local administration into the 17th century, but it is now regarded as a deserted medieval village. There were no visible remains of All Saints' Church by 1723, although land there remained as glebe belonging to the parish of St Nicholas. The site of All Saints' Church was excavated by archaeologists between 1978 and 1979. The main structure had been robbed of its materials leaving only the foundations, from which the archaeologists were able to interpret the history of the building's construction and its form. Among the foundations were discovered numerous stone carvings, floor tiles, remnants of stained glass, and several disturbed graves.|$|E
5|$|Around 8.30 pm on 14 September, miscreants pelted {{stones at}} the chapel of Padua Pre-university College, a Christian college located at Nanthoor, badly {{damaging}} <b>its</b> <b>windows.</b> Around 9.30 pm, miscreants badly damaged a statue located {{in front of}} Carmelites' house in Katkere, near Koteshwar. The Church of St. Sebastian in Permannur was badly damaged, including <b>its</b> <b>windows</b> and furniture. The Holy Cross Church at Kulshekar and St. Joseph, The Worker Church at Vamanjoor were also damaged. Police reports confirmed that Our Lady's Grotto at Vijayamarie Technical Institute and properties at the Infant Jesus Higher Primary School and Mary Hill Convent were also damaged by the miscreants {{on the night of}} 14 September. K. A. Abraham, pastor of Divine Deliverance Prayer Centre at Neerugadde in Shiroor, claimed that over 25 miscreants had attacked his prayer hall, and they were reported to have smashed the window panes, ransacked equipment and set a motorcycle and car on fire. Later, {{in the early hours of}} 15 September, individuals broke into the St. George Church belonging to the Syro Malabar Catholic Rite of the Belthangady Diocese in Ujire, Dakshina Kannada district, 70km from Mangalore and burned the Bible, the carpet, prayer books and desecrated holy icons. Miscreants also ransacked the St. Thomas Church in Gorigandi in Chikkamagaluru district. Seven or eight masked men arriving on scooters were reported to have desecrated the large statue of St. Antony at St. Ann's Friary on Jail Road in Bejai, throwing flower pots to smash its glass covering. The official report into the attacks later claimed that the Bajrang Dal were the likely suspects for the attacks on churches in Chikkamagaluru district, including the Christian Believers' Prayer Hall, Jagadeshwara Church in Mudigere and Carmel Mathe Devalaya in Kudremukh, and had also harassed people gathered at Kapitanio High School in Mangalore. Several people also reportedly invaded the house and prayer meeting of a neo-convert in Singatagere of Kadur taluk. Other areas affected by the attacks include Kalkanady, Falnir, Madyanthar, Makodu, Singatagere, Jayapura, Shaktinagar, Thokottu, Bantwal, Belthangady, Udupi, Kulur, Kundapura, Karkala, Koppa, Balehanoor and Moodbidri. Individuals were also targeted during the event; in Kulur, two men and two children were attacked by a Hindu mob near Gurupur Bridge while on their way to their hometown in a private car, and in Kalladka, the Souza Textile owner and his wife were attacked by unidentified people. Two separate stabbing incidents were also reported in Kalladka, and the two men affected were admitted to hospital with serious injuries.|$|E

30|$|The {{simulation}} results in [48] demonstrate that FeW improves TCP performance dramatically, which verifies FeW's assumption that <b>its</b> <b>window</b> prediction mechanism is still {{as accurate as}} that in legacy TCP. The wireless connection can benefit from both the quick reaction of legacy TCP and the load alleviation of FeW. However, {{it is not yet}} clear to what extent short connections with only relatively small amounts of data might suffer from the slower congestion window growth and the resulting slower convergence. Moreover, the window update mechanism of FeW cannot make full use of <b>its</b> accurate predicted <b>window</b> for transmission, because, in practice, this leads to a scheme with a non-integer increment in the window size per RTT. Although FeW adjusts <b>its</b> congestion <b>window</b> in the same pattern as legacy TCP does, the fractional part of <b>its</b> <b>window</b> takes no effect on transmission and a certain amount of predicted network capacity is wasted. A solution for this problem is provided in [49].|$|R
5|$|Previously, the Sistine Chapel's only {{ventilation}} {{was from}} <b>its</b> <b>windows</b> {{in the upper}} level of the walls. To prevent exhaust fumes and wind-blown pollutants from entering, the windows are now permanently closed and an air conditioning system has been installed. The installation is by Carrier of the United Technologies Corporation and was developed {{with the cooperation of}} the Vatican's Office of Technical Services. It has been designed to counteract the various problems specific to the Chapel, in particular the rapid changes of heat and humidity that occur with the admission of the first crowds of tourists each morning and the departure of the last visitors each afternoon. The air conditioning varies not only the heat but also the relative humidity between the summer and winter months so that changes to the atmospheric environment occur gradually. The air near the ceiling is kept at a temperate level, while the air in the lower section of the building is cooler and circulates more rapidly, with the effect that dirt particles fall towards the floor rather than being streamed upwards. Bacteria and chemical pollutants are filtered out.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortunes}} of the Moreton family declined during the English Civil War. As supporters of the Royalist cause, they found themselves isolated {{in a community of}} Parliamentarians. Little Moreton Hall was requisitioned by the Parliamentarians in 1643 and used to billet Parliamentary soldiers. The family successfully petitioned for its restitution, and survived the Civil War with their ownership of Little Moreton Hall intact, but financially they were crippled. They tried to sell the entire estate, but could only dispose of several parcels of land. William Moreton died in 1654 leaving debts of £3,000–£4,000 (equivalent to about £12–16 million as of 2010), which forced his heirs to remortgage what remained of the estate. The family's fortunes never fully recovered, and by the late 1670s they no longer lived in Little Moreton Hall, renting it out instead to a series of tenant farmers. The Dale family took over the tenancy in 1841, and were still in residence more than 100 years later. By 1847 most of the house was unoccupied, and the deconsecrated Chapel was being used as a coal cellar and storeroom. Little Moreton Hall was in a ruinous condition; <b>its</b> <b>windows</b> were boarded up and its roof was rotten.|$|E
