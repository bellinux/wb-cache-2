5|$|The coffeehouse {{became a}} popular place to debate ideas, with growing {{literacy}} {{and the development}} of the printing press making news widely available; and Fleet Street became the centre of the British press. Following the invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies, many financiers relocated to London, especially a large Jewish community, and the first London <b>international</b> <b>issue</b> was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the Royal Navy became the world leading war fleet, acting as a serious deterrent to potential economic adversaries of the United Kingdom. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.|$|E
25|$|The {{arbitration}} {{case was}} originally between the {{farmers in the}} affected area and COMINCO; however, what started off as the smelter versus agriculturalists evolved when regional and federal agents became involved, resulting in the dispute becoming an <b>international</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
25|$|The South Tyrolean {{question}} (Südtirolfrage) {{became an}} <b>international</b> <b>issue.</b> As {{the implementation of}} the post-war agreement was not seen as satisfactory by the Austrian government, the matter became the cause of significant friction with Italy and was taken up by the United Nations in 1960. A fresh round of negotiations took place in 1961 but this proved unsuccessful.|$|E
50|$|He {{remained}} {{involved in}} <b>international</b> <b>issues</b> {{for the rest}} of his life. With Margaret Mead, Father Theodore Hesburgh, Robert McNamara and James Grant, he founded New Directions, an ambitious attempt to create a citizen's lobby on <b>international</b> <b>issues.</b> It helped win passage of the Panama Canal Treat but ultimately did not obtain the necessary financial support for long term viability. Using his corporate experience, Wilson was instrumental in introducing the use of opinion polling, public affairs advertising, direct mail marketing techniques and focus group research to understand donor behavior to <b>international</b> <b>issues.</b> He believed that such modern lobbying techniques were essential to creating political support for <b>international</b> <b>issues.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Arab–Israeli {{conflict}} {{is a modern}} phenomenon, which {{has its roots in}} the end of the 19th century. The conflict became a major <b>international</b> <b>issue</b> with the birth of Israel in 1948. The Arab–Israeli conflict has resulted in at least five major wars and a number of minor conflicts. It has also been the source of two major Palestinian uprisings (s).|$|E
25|$|On 30 October 1918, the Armistice of Mudros {{was signed}} and both parties {{accepted}} their current positions. General Marshall accepted {{the surrender of}} Khalil Pasha and the Ottoman 6th Army on the same day, but Cobbe did not hold his current position as the armistice required, and continued to advance on Mosul {{in the face of}} Turkish protests. British troops marched unopposed into the city on the 14 November 1918. The ownership of Mosul Province and its rich oil fields became an <b>international</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
25|$|President Lee {{also held}} {{bilateral}} summits {{with the leaders}} of the United States, Japan, and People's Republic of China to discuss North Korean affairs. In the wake of the ROKS Cheonan sinking, a joint declaration was issued by the G-8 leaders condemning the North. President Lee succeeded in bringing the Cheonan incident to the forefront in the Chair's Statement for the Asia-Europe Meeting in 2010 at Brussels, drawing member nation support for the South Korean government's stance on North Korea's nuclear issue and stability in Northeast Asia. In addition, President Lee urged Japanese Prime Minister Kan Naoto to put his words on 15 August, Korea's Liberation Day into action. Regular reunions of the families separated by the Korean War drew attention as an <b>international</b> <b>issue</b> after being included in the Chair's Statement.|$|E

25|$|If adopted, the Bill would mount {{a serious}} {{challenge}} to the continued deployment of nuclear weapons throughout the world's oceans. The New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone Extension bill lost its second reading on 29 May 2002. Opposition to amending New Zealand's anti-nuclear legislation came from the New Zealand Labour Party, who say that implementing the detail would be impossible and could make the proposed new legislation unenforceable. They said the bill breaches a fundamental principle of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which requires all countries to allow freedom of navigation through their EEZs. However, anti-nuclear activists remain confident that the amendments to New Zealand's nuclear legislation will eventually pass, citing grey areas {{of the law in}} the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. There is a firm belief amongst New Zealanders, as indicated by polls, that New Zealand must take leadership on this vital <b>International</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E

500|$|Plans {{to build}} a center for {{students}} were announced by LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball in 1979. By 1984, the church had obtained a 49-year lease on the land and had begun construction. The center's prominent position on the Jerusalem skyline quickly brought it notice by the religious conservatives, or Haredim, of Israel. Protests and opposition to {{the building of the}} center springing from the Haredim made the issue of building the center a national and even <b>international</b> <b>issue.</b> After several investigative committees of Israel's Knesset reviewed and debated the issue, Israeli officials decided to allow the center's construction to continue in 1986. The center opened to students in May 1988 and was dedicated by Howard W. Hunter on May 16, 1989. [...] It did not admit students from 2001 to 2006 due to security issues during the Second Intifada but continued to provide tours for visitors and weekly concerts.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a study of {{relationship}} of print media cartoons and the portrayal of <b>international</b> <b>issues.</b> This {{is an effort to}} explore the portrayal of <b>international</b> <b>issues</b> through the cartoons published in the two Norwegian newspapers (the VG & the Aftenposten) and the two Pakistani newspapers (The News & the Nation) from September 2008 to February 2009. For the sake of evaluating the nature, degree, frequency and stance of the international cartoons, the <b>international</b> <b>issues,</b> variables and categories are constructed under the light of main postulates of the one aspect of the Agenda Setting Theory that is “Framing”. Through a content analysis (both qualitative and quantitative), Discourse analysis and interview method, it identifies {{that in the case of}} the Norwegian newspapers, the VG is more critical than the Aftenposten, while in the case of Pakistani newspapers, the Nation is more critical than The News regarding the cartoon coverage of <b>international</b> <b>issues</b> during this selected period. The <b>international</b> <b>issues</b> were not covered and criticized equally by both cases as there may be some hidden pressure to the cartoonists to suggest what to sketch or not?
