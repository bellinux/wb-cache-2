Molds may exist in top, horizontal or bottom-up pouring and may be fluted or flat walled. The fluted design increases heat transfer owing to a larger contact area. Molds may be either solid [...] "massive" [...] design, sand cast (e.g. for pig iron) or water-cooled shells, depending upon heat transfer requirements. <b>Ingot</b> <b>molds</b> are tapered to prevent the formation of cracks due to uneven cooling.

40|$|Abstract. While using {{water cooled}} mold to produce steel ingot, an air gap is {{generated}} between the ingot and the mold, {{which has an}} important influence on the ingot quality. The air gap formation law and its influence on the solidification process were calculated by used FE software Procast. It is shown that, air gap occurs {{in a few minutes}} after the solidification begins. In 75 - 100 s later the gap reaches 0. 2 - 0. 5 mm and starts to influent the heat transport significantly, the rate of the temperature decrease becomes slower. When the solidification is finished, there is a lager gap on the two narrow surfaces than it on the other wide surfaces; and the gap on the two narrow surfaces is different. The air gap on the narrow surface close to the sprue has a width of 12 - 20 mm; on the other narrow surface away from the sprue has a width of 4 - 13 mm. The biggest gap on the two wide surfaces has a size about 6. 5 mm.

In order to simplify the operation, a single melt, or simplex'' operation, alloying and injecting casting in one step was tried.

The interior parts of the furnace became coated with condensed metal to an extent that threatened mechanical and electrical failure of the furnace.

While the hoard of ingots excavated at Uluburun brings {{the total number}} of copper ingots from the Late Bronze Age to over 1000, interestingly, only one <b>ingot</b> <b>mold</b> from the that period has been identified. Scholars have speculated over the means behind the creation of these ingots for decades, but with a relative absence of archaeological molds the most promising method of reaching any conclusions as to the types of molds used in antiquity seems to be experimentation. Experimental archaeology, has, in recent years been responsible for many breakthroughs in how the past is viewed. In the face of an overwhelming disparity of copper ingot molds from the Late Bronze Age, trials designed around testing different mold materials and casting techniques have the potential to determine, with relative certainty, how copper ingots were cast over 3000 years ago. This thesis examines the possible materials used to create copper ingot molds through a study of their prevalence in antiquity and also details experiments in which these materials were used, in concert with different casting techniques, to create copper ingots. The results of these experiments are combined with analyses of the Uluburun ingots in an effort to bring some closure to the debate surrounding copper ingot molds in the Late Bronze Age...|$|E
50|$|Most {{grades of}} steel are melted once and are then cast or teemed into a solid form prior to {{extensive}} forging or rolling to a metallurgically sound form. In contrast, VIM-VAR steels go through two more highly purifying melts under vacuum. After melting in an {{electric arc furnace}} and alloying in an argon oxygen decarburization vessel, steels destined for vacuum remelting are cast into <b>ingot</b> <b>molds.</b> The solidified <b>ingots</b> then head for a vacuum induction melting furnace. This vacuum remelting process rids the steel of inclusions and unwanted gases while optimizing the chemical composition. The VIM operation returns these solid ingots to the molten state in the contaminant-free void of a vacuum. This tightly controlled melt often requires up to 24 hours. Still enveloped by the vacuum, the hot metal flows from the VIM furnace crucible into giant electrode molds. A typical electrode stands about 15 feet (5 m) tall and will be in various diameters. The electrodes solidify under vacuum.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{shape memory}} alloys (MSMA) {{strongly}} deform (up to 10 %) {{when exposed to}} an external magnetic field. The alloy must be in single crystalline form to demonstrate these properties. Growth of single crystals from the molten phase is a time consuming and expensive process. We conduct grain growth experiments to produce single crystals from the solid state. This production route is comparatively inexpensive and avoids disadvantages such as chemical segregation. To process these single crystals, alloys with various compositions were cast, from bulk materials, into cylindrical copper <b>ingot</b> <b>molds</b> with diameters ranging from 0. 9 mm to 1. 9 mm. Disks were cut from the cast ingot rods and the sample disks were polished to a smooth reflective finish. The disks were then subjected to heat treatments with varying temperatures and dwell times. These heat treatments induced grain growth in the samples. The main goal of these experiments is to grow large grains that can be ‘cut out’ of the parent samples to extract single crystals.

40|$|The ingot {{formation}} or “melt ” {{process is}} the first step in many steel making operations. This process involves melting steel and alloys for desired chemical composition, then pouring it into a variety of <b>ingot</b> <b>molds.</b> Complex technological and resource constraints can make the planning and scheduling of such processes extremely challenging. In this paper, we report our experience in developing solution methods for this “melt scheduling ” problem at BethForge, a division of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, and a manufacturer of custom-made heavy steel forgings. We describe the main issues associated with generic melt scheduling problem as well as constraints that are specific to BethForge. The problem at BethForge is particularly challenging due to the need to keep the ingot at a high temperature before forging, their high product variety, and the need to consider trade-offs between two conflicting objectives. We first formulate the base melt scheduling problem as a mixed integer program. We then decouple the scheduling decisions into two levels and develop a local search algorithm based on Storer and Wu’s problem space neighborhood. Our aim is to generate a family of efficient schedules that allow decision makers to balance the tradeoff between two criteria. Computational experiments are performed using data from BethForge.

Uniaxial hot tensile tests in the temperature range of 700 – 1100 °C under a constant strain rate of 10 - 3 s- 1 were carried out. Hot ductility {{as a function of}} reduction of area (RA) showed a significant improvement in the V-microalloyed TWIP steel, when compared to a non-microalloyed TWIP steel with a similar composition, in the intermediate temperature range of 800 – 900 °C. The highest value of 86 % RA is attributed to the onset of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) near to the fracture tip. On the other hand, Ti addition to TWIP steel did not exhibit any improvement on the hot ductility, resulting in the worst hot ductility behavior, with a maximum value of 34 % RA. The TWIP steels solidified in metallic <b>ingot</b> <b>molds</b> (MM) showed higher peak stress (sp) and ductility values than the sand <b>mold</b> (SM) cast <b>ingots</b> at low and intermediate temperatures, respectively, which is associated with the finer microstructure generated during solidification.

40|$|Este trabalho foi dedicado ao estudo do efeito da fadiga térmica nas lingoteiras em aço produzidas pela empresa Duritcast, para vazamento de alumínio. Para tal, foram realizados ensaios de imersão cíclica de amostras de fragmentos de lingoteiras em alumínio líquido num forno adaptado com o propósito de simular a fadiga térmica. As amostras antes e após os ciclos térmicos foram caracterizadas por ensaios de tração uniaxial, de dureza e observações microestruturais por microscopia ótica e eletrónica. Paralelamente foram efetuados cálculos pelo método dos elementos finitos com o objetivo de determinar a intensidade e distribuição das tensões térmicas desenvolvidas nas lingoteiras e nas amostras durante os ciclos térmicos. Foi possível simular os gradientes térmicos e tensões térmicas desenvolvidas nas lingoteiras e nas amostras utilizadas nos ensaios de fadiga térmica, utilizando o método dos elementos finitos. Os resultados obtidos permitiram prever o desenvolvimento de tensões térmicas superiores ao valor limite de elasticidade do aço WC 6, e consequente deformação plástica do material. Os ciclos térmicos provocaram um aumento de tensão limite de elasticidade, tensão de rotura e dureza e uma diminuição de deformação uniforme do aço WC 6. A análise microestrutural realizada permitiu concluir que o {{principal}} mecanismo responsável por estas alterações foi o encruamento resultante da deformação plástica do material devido às tensões térmicas geradas durante os ciclos térmicos. Com base nestes resultados foram sugeridas medidas susceptíveis de aumentar o tempo de vida em serviço das lingoteiras. This {{work was}} devoted to study the effect of thermal fatigue in steel molds produced by the company Duritcast for aluminum casting. For this purpose, cyclic immersing tests in liquid aluminum were accomplished in an adapted furnace aiming the simulation of the thermal fatigue on samples cut from mold fragments. The samples were characterized by uniaxial tensile tests, hardness tests and microstructural observations by optical and electron microscopy before and after thermal cycles. At the same time, simulations by finite element method were performed {{with the aim of}} calculating intensity and distribution of thermal stresses developed in the <b>ingot</b> <b>molds</b> during the thermal cycles. It was possible to simulate the thermal gradients and thermal stresses developed in the mold and in the samples used in thermal fatigue tests by finite element method simulation. The results allowed to predict the development of thermal stresses higher than the yield stress of the steel WC 6 and, consequent, by plastic deformation of the pieces. The thermal cycles promoted an increase of yield strength, tensile strength and hardness and a decrease of uniform deformation of the WC 6 steel samples. The microstructural analysis allowed to conclude that the main mechanism for these changes was the strain hardening resulting from plastic deformation due to the thermal stresses developed during the thermal cycle. Based on these results some measures to increase the service lifetime of the <b>ingot</b> <b>molds</b> were suggested. Mestrado em Engenharia de Materiai...|$|R

Experimental results show {{a reduction in}} amount of large inclusions when the mold rotation rate is 6 r·min- 1, and the inclusions are uniformly distributed in the ESR ingot. As comparison with the electroslag ingots of conventional ESR (stationary mold), {{the portion of the}} Al 2 O 3 inclusions smaller than 1 μm in size increase from 38 % to 41. 4 %, whereas that of the SiO 2 inclusions increases from 48 % to 74 % in the <b>ingots</b> when <b>mold</b> rotation is applied. This phenomenon is caused by the decrease in metal droplet size, resulting in large contact area between the slag pool and metal droplets in ESR process with mold rotation. Moreover, the metal droplets have relatively long movement routes, leading to long metal contact time between the slag pool and metal droplets when a relative motion between the consumable electrodes and mold is present. However, when the mold rotation rate is increased to 45 r·min- 1, inclusion removing effect decreases. An excessive rotation rate causes wild motion in the slag pool, which drives the molten metal droplets to move violently, and as a result, the slag is entrapped into the metal pool, decreasing the ability of slag absorbing inclusions...|$|R

To get a better insight during the casting and understand why the molds were burned onto the ingots; during the second series of trials one mold on each base plate were filmed {{in the beginning of the}} casting process. Evaluation of the castings indicated that splashing on the mold wall at an initial stage was one reason for the mold burned onto the ingot. Further, material samples were collected to evaluate the non-metallic inclusion composition and distribution with SEM when casting with a swirl blade compared to when casting without. The area percentage of the inclusions in the samples was 1 % and 2 % for samples casted with and without swirl blade respectively with d= 2. 8 mm. The inclusion size also varied for samples casted with and without swirl blade; 98 % of the inclusions were in the size range of 0 - 10 μm when casted with and in the size range 0 - 20 μm when casted without swirl blade. Syftet med denna uppsats har varit att utvärdera användningen av swirlblad i götgjutningsprocessen. Två serier med försök har utförts på Scana Steel Stavanger AS. I försöken användes en inloppssten med 62 °-vinklat utlopp, där duplexa rostfria stål göts på stigplan med två 6, 2 tons kokiller. Alla kokiller brände fast på göten, vilket ledde till svårigheter vid urtag av göten samt skador på kokillerna. För att få en bättre förståelse av varför kokillerna brände fast, filmades ett göt på vardera stigplan under den andra försöksserien. Utvärdering av försöken indikerar att en anledning till att kokillerna brände fast på göten var att det stänkte upp stål på kokillväggen i ett tidigt stadium.
