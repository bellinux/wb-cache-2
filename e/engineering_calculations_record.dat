40|$|Verifying the {{correctness}} {{of structural}} <b>engineering</b> <b>calculations</b> In 1997, The American Society of Civil Engineers published a report prepared by their Task Committee on Avoiding Failures caused by Computer Misuse, the self-checking procedures developed {{in this research}} {{have been designed to}} prevent such misuse. In 2002, The Institution of Structural Engineers, published Guidelines for the use of computers for <b>engineering</b> <b>calculations,</b> which commence "These guidelines have been prepared in response to growing concern regarding the appropriate use of computers for structural calculations " and end with "Ten Top Tips to help get things right". The IStructE guidelines give definitive technical management advice which the writer advocates. This research deals with engineering matters not covered by the IStructE guidelines, the target audience is engineers who develop and support software for the production of <b>engineering</b> <b>calculations.</b> Verifying the correctness of structural <b>engineering</b> <b>calculations</b> considers calculations for both the structural analysis of frameworks and the structural design of component...|$|R

40|$|This student {{textbook}} {{considers the}} material about {{two parts of}} the course ?<b>Engineering</b> <b>calculations</b> and design of optical instruments?. It includes <b>engineering</b> <b>calculations</b> of the instruments based on typical optical schemes and the accuracy in design procedures. 	The first part specifies the typical optical schemes as telescopic, microscope and projective ones. It shows the theory for <b>engineering</b> <b>calculations</b> of these optical schemes, examples of these calculation problems and questions. 	The second part presents the technique for accuracy analysis in the design of optical instruments. The principal topics are identification and systematization of primary errors, definition of their transfer functions, calculation of partial errors and evaluation of the total instrument errors. It is important that this part formulates the recommendations for compensations of the errors when their values are bigger than the requested limit. This part also contains examples of <b>engineering</b> <b>calculations,</b> problems and questions. 	The goal of this student textbook is to help students in understanding of the corresponded parts of the course and preparation of B.
