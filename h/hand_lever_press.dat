The press forces the tea into a metal form that is occasionally {{decorated with a}} motif in sunken-relief. Due to its efficiency, this method is used to make almost all forms of pressed pu'er. Tea can be pressed either with or without it being bagged, with the latter done by using a metal mould. Tightly compressed bǐng, formed directly into a mold without bags using this method are known as tié bǐng ( [...] , literally [...] "iron cake/puck") due to its density and hardness. The taste of densely compressed raw pu'er is believed to benefit from careful aging for up to several decades.|$|R

40|$|The “hedonic” {{value of}} {{reinforcers}} is mediated by dopamine. Accordingly,haloperidol diminishes {{the value of}} reinforcers, by interfering with the emission of operant behaviors. Alternatively, the interference of dopamine transmission does not prevent animals from eating food. Thus, reinforcers remain intact after the administration of haloperidol. We assessed these possibilities with eight Wistar rats and two types of reinforcers, food-pellets and sucrose-water, delivered under multiple reinforcement schedules. Ingeneral, <b>lever</b> <b>presses</b> maintained by food-pellets were higher than those maintained by sucrose-water. Haloperidol produced dose-related decreases in <b>lever</b> <b>presses</b> and obtained reinforcers.

40|$|Eight rats' <b>lever</b> <b>presses</b> were {{reinforced}} {{after an}} interruption in a tone, provided the lever {{had not been}} pressed before the tone interruption. After a few sessions, long before the animals reliably refrained from lever pressing before the interruption, the latencies of postinterruption presses (time from the termination of the interruption to {{the moment of the}} <b>lever</b> <b>press)</b> dissociated into two classes: short ones for to-be-rewarded presses, and long ones for presses in the other trials, which contained no reward because one or more <b>lever</b> <b>presses</b> had occurred before the interruption. Thus discrimination of impending reinforcement in the current trial occurred before there was evidence of sensitivity to reinforcement in the reinforcement-producing aspect of behavior. This finding is related to Shimp's (1981) contention that the temporal properties of recent behavior are reinforceable, if remembered. The present finding shows that learning to discriminate whether one's behavior has met a contingency, and learning to carry out this behavior, need not go together, implying that memory of temporal properties is probably a necessary but not a sufficient condition for learning the latter...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} assess whether depriving rats of food would increase the reinforcement effectiveness of wheel running (Experiment 1) and whether satiation for wheel running would decrease the reinforcement effectiveness of food (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, a progressive-ratio schedule {{was used to measure}} the reinforcement effectiveness of wheel running when rats were deprived or not deprived of food. Completion of a fixed number of <b>lever</b> <b>presses</b> released a brake on a running wheel for 60 s, and the response requirement was systematically increased until the rat stopped pressing or until 8 hr had elapsed. The ratio value reached (and the total number of <b>lever</b> <b>presses)</b> was an inverted-U function of food deprivation (percentage body weight). In Experiment 2, when wheel running preceded test sessions, fewer food-reinforced <b>lever</b> <b>presses</b> were maintained by the progressive-ratio schedule, and responding occurred at a lower rate on a variable-interval schedule. An interpretation of these results is that deprivation or satiation with respect to one event (such as food) alters the reinforcement effectiveness of a different event (such as access to wheel running) ...|$|R
40|$|Mice {{devoid of}} CB 1 {{cannabinoid}} receptors (CB 1 / mice) pro-vide {{a unique opportunity}} to further investigate the role of CB 1 receptors in exocannabinoid and endocannabinoid effects. CB 1 / mice (N 18) and their wild-type littermates (CB 1 / mice; N 12) were placed in standard mouse operant chambers and trained to <b>lever</b> <b>press</b> under a fixed ratio 10 schedule of reinforcement. When stable <b>lever</b> <b>press</b> responding under the fixed ratio 10 schedule had been established, cannabinoids and noncannabinoids were administered to both groups. CB 1 / mice acquired the <b>lever</b> <b>press</b> response more readily than CB 1 / mice. 9 -Tetrahydrocannabinol (9 -THC) decreased le-ver press responding in CB 1 / mice only, whereas methanan-damide, a metabolically stable endocannabinoid analog, pro-duced similar response rate decreases in both genotypic groups. Similar to 9 -THC, another endocannabinoid analog, (R) -(20 -cyano- 16, 16 -dimethyl docosa-cis- 5, 8, 11, 14 -tetraeno) - 1 -hy-droxy- 2 -propylamine (O- 1812), decreased responding in CB 1 / mice, but not in CB 1 / mice. The CB 1 receptor an-tagonist N-(piperidin- 1 -yl) - 5 -(4 -chlorophenyl) - 1 -(2, 4 -dichlorophe-nyl- 4 -methyl- 1 H-pyrazole- 3 -carboxamide hydrochloride (SR 141716 A) blocked the effects of 9 -THC, but not those of methanandamide. Because methanandamide binds poorly to CB 2 receptors, these results suggest possible non-CB 1, non-CB 2 mechanisms of action for methanandamide-induced behavioral disruption of <b>lever</b> <b>press</b> responding. Ethanol and morphine elic-ited greater response decreases in CB 1 / mice than in CB 1 /mice, suggesting a possible role of CB 1 receptors in the rate disruptive effects of these drugs. In contrast, diazepam did not produce between group differences, suggesting that CB 1 receptors are not involved in diazepam-induced disruption of <b>lever</b> <b>press</b> responding. 9 -Tetrahydrocannabinol (9 -THC), the principle psycho-active constituent of marijuana and other natural, synthetic, and endocannabinoids, elicits a well characterized syndrome of pharmacological effects in laboratory animals (Dewey...|$|R

40|$|Rats will <b>lever</b> <b>press</b> {{to deliver}} nanolitre {{quantities}} of nicotine or the muscarinic agonist carbachol {{directly into the}} ventral tegmental area (VTA). The purpose of these experiments was to investigate further the characteristics of nicotine self-administration directly into the VTA. This study aimed to confirm previous data relating to intra-VTA self-administration of nicotine and carbachol and then test two hypotheses: (a) that pre-sensitisation of nicotinic receptors is needed for robust intra-VTA self administration and (b) that rats will <b>lever</b> <b>press</b> for intra-VTA nicotine if pre-trained to associate lever pressing with a rewarding outcome. Rats were equipped with cannulae aimed at posterior VTA and allowed five sessions to self-administer nicotine or carbachol. In different experiments, rats were either pre-sensitised to nicotine by subcutaneous (s. c.) injections or pre-trained to <b>lever</b> <b>press</b> for food and a simultaneous conditioned stimulus light. We confirmed that carbachol had strong activating effects when self-administered into the VTA; selective responding for nicotine developed over five sessions by reduction {{in the amount of}} pressing on an inactive lever. Prior sensitisation did not improve responding for intra-VTA nicotine but training rats to <b>lever</b> <b>press</b> before putting them on the drug regime did potentiate pressing. The action of nicotine in the VTA might be better considered as reinforcement enhancing and that its intrinsic rewarding property here is at best weak.

40|$|Mesolimbic {{dopamine}} (DA) {{is involved}} in behavioral activation and effort-related processes. Rats with impaired DA transmission reallocate their instrumental behavior away from food-reinforced tasks with high response requirements, and instead select less effortful food-seeking behaviors. In the present study, the effects of several drug treatments were assessed using a progressive ratio (PROG) /chow feeding concurrent choice task. With this task, rats can <b>lever</b> <b>press</b> on a PROG schedule reinforced by a preferred high-carbohydrate food pellet, or alternatively approach and consume the lesspreferred but concurrently available laboratory chow. Rats pass through each ratio level 15 times, after which the ratio requirement is incremented by one additional response. The DA D 2 antagonist haloperidol (0. 025 – 0. 1 mg/kg) reduced number of <b>lever</b> <b>presses</b> and highest ratio achieved but did not reduce chow intake. In contrast, the adenosine A 2 A antagonist MSX- 3 increased <b>lever</b> <b>presses</b> and highest ratio achieved, but decreased chow consumption. The cannabinoid CB 1 inverse agonist and putative appetite suppressant AM 251 decreased <b>lever</b> <b>presses,</b> highest ratio achieved, and chow intake; this effect {{was similar to that}} produced by pre-feeding. Furthermore, DA-related signal transduction activity (pDARPP- 32 (Thr 34) expression) was greater in nucleus accumbens core of high responders (rats with high lever pressing output) compared to low responders. Thus, the effects of DA antagonism differed greatly from those produced by prefeeding or reduced CB 1 transmission, and it appears unlikely that haloperidol reduces PROG responding because of a general reduction in primary food motivation or the unconditioned reinforcing properties of food. Furthermore, accumbens core signal transduction activity is related to individual differences in work outpu...|$|R
40|$|In the scaling {{experiment}} proper, 8 rats had {{to reproduce}} 10 randomly presented time intervals ranging from 1. 3 to 20 s. The {{beginning of the}} reproduction was separated {{from the end of}} the standard by a 300 ms interruption of the sound indicating the durations. The rat determined the length of the reproduction by pressing a lever, thereby terminating the sound. The scaling model and the final result of the experiment are briefly described. However, before this final phase of the experiment, the rats had to learn to attend to the interruption. This was achieved in Phase 2 of the experiment by defining <b>lever</b> <b>presses</b> during presentation of the standard as incorrect behavior, which was penalized by withholding the reward and lengthening the actual standard duration by 4 s. Scrutiny of the Phase 2 data revealed two unexpected— serendipitous—findings. 1.

40|$|In {{the first}} of four experiments, rats were exposed to a {{modified}} multiple continuous reinforcement-extinction schedule during 15 -min daily sessions. In one condition (saves condition) with the cuelight on, a single <b>lever</b> <b>press</b> produced a food pellet, briefly extinguished the cuelight, and started a clock. Saves (additional <b>lever</b> <b>presses</b> with interresponse times less than 1 s) produced an additional food pellet, briefly extinguished the cuelight, and restarted the interresponse time clock. The cuelight was extinguished 1 s after the last <b>lever</b> <b>press</b> and remained off during a 10 -s period of extinction, during which no food pellets were delivered. In the other condition (savings account condition), the contingencies were the same except that the cuelight was extinguished and was not reilluminated after the initial <b>lever</b> <b>press,</b> and the delivery of all food pellets in the reinforcement component was delayed until the onset of extinction. In both conditions, rats made saves, but mean saves (total saves divided by the number of reinforcement components) were slightly reduced in the savings account condition. In Experiment 2, using six equally spaced 15 -min sessions per day on alternate days, saves were either followed immediately with food and brief cuelight offset (saves condition) or were not reinforced at all. Mean saves were much greater when saves were reinforced. In Experiment 3, during 5 -min daily sessions, saves earned a single pellet (savings account condition) or a number of pellets equal to the ordinal number of the <b>lever</b> <b>press</b> (interest condition). Rats made fewer mean saves, with little change in the food rate, when saves earned interest. In Experiment 4, the rats earned all their food in the operant situation during 24 daily 5 -min sessions, these separated by 55 -min intersession intervals during which no food was available; otherwise, the conditions were the same as in Experiment 3. In Experiment 4, the shift to interest for saves led to an increase in mean daily mean saves (total daily mean saves divided by the number of daily sessions) as well as to {{an increase in the number}} of food pellets delivered in each session.

40|$|The {{cerebellum}} {{is involved}} in sensory-motor integration and cognitive functions. The origin and function of the field potential oscillations in the cerebellum, especially in the high frequencies, have not been explored sufficiently. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the spatio-temporal characteristics of high frequency field potentials (150 - 350 Hz) in the cerebellar cortex in a behavioral context. To this end, we recorded from the paramedian lobule in rats using micro electro-corticogram (µ-ECoG) electrode arrays while the animal performed a <b>lever</b> <b>press</b> task using the forelimb. The phase synchrony analysis shows that the high frequency oscillations recorded at multiple points across the paramedian cortex episodically synchronize immediately before and desynchronize during the <b>lever</b> <b>press.</b> The electrode contacts were grouped according to their temporal course of phase synchrony around the time of <b>lever</b> <b>press.</b> Contact groups presented patches with slightly stronger synchrony values in the medio-lateral direction, and did not appear to form parasagittal zones.

In contrast, lever pressing that had been reinforced under a variable ratio (VR) schedule, or by self-administration of 10 % sucrose (10 S) alone, was sensitive to outcome devaluation. The relative insensitivity to outcome devaluation indicated that seeking of 10 S 10 E by the VI-trained rats had become an instrumental habit. In the present study we employed an alternative operational definition of an instrumental habit and compared the effect of reversing the action-outcome contingency on <b>lever</b> <b>press</b> performance by rats trained under the same experimental conditions. Male Long Evans rats received daily operant training, in which <b>lever</b> <b>presses</b> were reinforced by 10 S 10 E or 10 S, under VI or VR schedules.
