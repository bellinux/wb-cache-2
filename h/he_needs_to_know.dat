5|$|Harmony (Laura San Giacomo) {{succeeds in}} convincing Keith that their {{relationship}} is not immoral. Vinnie Van Lowe (Ken Marino) enters Mars Investigations and tells Keith that <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{the whereabouts of}} Kendall Casablancas. Afterwards, he blackmails Keith by showing him pictures of him and Harmony, saying that Keith must pay $4,000 to prevent the information from being shown to Harmony’s husband. Veronica gets exasperated with Meryl when she feels that Meryl refuses to see the truth about Sully cheating on her. Veronica talks to the professor about his affair with Mindy O’Dell, {{but he says that}} he’ll give her the scholarship no matter what. After seeing Meryl and Scarlett hug, Veronica tries to frame Mercer to no avail. After showing Logan the evidence that Mercer is innocent, he tells Veronica what he was doing: they were in Tijuana, and Mercer set a room on fire. There were girls in Mercer’s room, but Logan ran away when the fire spread.|$|E
25|$|Athena {{appears to}} Odysseus upon his arrival, {{disguised}} as a herdsman; she initially lies and tells him that Penelope, his wife, has remarried {{and that he is}} believed to be dead, but Odysseus lies back to her, employing skillful prevarications to protect himself. Impressed by his resolve and shrewdness, she reveals herself and tells him what <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> in order to win back his kingdom. She disguises him as an elderly beggar so that he will not be recognized by the suitors or Penelope, and helps him to defeat the suitors.|$|E
500|$|Walter {{undergoes}} a CT scan, {{and the team}} learn Walter had three pieces of his brain tissue removed from his Hippocampus which is the primary repository for long term memory. The pieces were then apparently stored inside the brains of the cured patients fourteen years ago. Knowing only Walter could comprehend the memories concerning how to open a portal to another reality, the shapeshifters kidnap him. By the time the others find Walter, Newton has already learned what <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> and escapes. Olivia manages to stop them, but is {{forced to choose between}} seizing Newton and saving Walter, as he has been given a lethal dose of a neurotoxin that will kill him unless Newton gives them the correct directions. Olivia chooses to save Walter's life, and Newton replies [...] "Now I know how weak you are".|$|E

60|$|But <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{what was}} right, {{what was the}} proper {{sequence}} of his acts. Staring at the darkness, he seemed to feel his course, though {{he could not see}} it. He bowed in obedience. The stars seemed to swing softly in token of submission.|$|R
50|$|Returning to the Inn, {{short one}} horse which {{died from the}} Transfer, Mendoza confronts Porfirio. He must have known {{what was going to}} happen to her.

500|$|In 2008, viewers saw Martha {{coming to}} terms with a second pregnancy. The storyline began after Martha left old boyfriend Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) for Jack. She was unsure of the child's paternity, but kept it a secret from Jack. Gordon said this is [...] "Because she doesn't think he ever needs to know. Roman's said he doesn't want to be {{involved}} and he wants to say it's Jack's. And so does Martha..." [...] After Martha has a miscarriage scare, Roman wanted to know if the baby was his. Gordon explained that [...] "Roman says <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if he is or isn't the baby's father and Martha has to agree to do a DNA test. [...] They wait till Jack's out of the room then quickly arrange it. Martha's so scared of losing Jack she wants the facts before deciding her next step." [...] Martha's relationship with Jack was at its strongest at that time, but Gordon was concerned about Martha's lies: [...] "Martha and Jack have been through more than most and right now their relationship is as solid as it could be. But she's taking a big chance not being honest about her pregnancy." [...] She described Roman being the baby's father as [...] "Martha's worst nightmare".|$|E
2500|$|Goyer later explained, [...] "What {{the series}} is, {{in a weird}} way, {{is kind of like}} a Wiseguy with vampires, because Jill's {{character}} is kind of a double agent working for Blade, within the vampire community, and [...] treating the vampires sort of like the ultimate crime family. Blade realizes {{at the beginning of the}} pilot that he's not making much headway, just sort of hacking and slashing, that <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> more about their inner workings." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former {{president}} of Sarah Lawrence College, Michele Tolela Myers, responded to Michael Skube's rebuttal in the 12 July 2007 Letter to the Editor for the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Argument {{may be a}} rank disgrace." [...] On the general topic of U.S. News methodology, she states, [...] "what many of us dispute is the validity of a single score computed by using [...] "data points" [...] to which weights are arbitrarily ascribed (why should retention count for 20% instead of 30%; why is peer assessment 25% instead of 10%; and who decides?). How can a single measure be valid when, in some cases, values are made up {{when they are not}} provided (the case of the missing SATs at Sarah Lawrence — the point of my Washington Post Op-Ed)? However, that's exactly what U.S. News does each year. Professional statisticians have reported that the methodology used by the magazine is seriously flawed and cannot be trusted." [...] She also responds to Skube's discussion of Sarah Lawrence's decision not to consider SAT or ACT scores by stating, [...] "Skube says he knows 'all <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about Sarah Lawrence' because the college does not use SAT scores in its admission process, and therefore he infers we don't take aptitude seriously. Perhaps he doesn't know the research showing that SAT tests do not measure aptitude and at best provide a guess about academic performance {{in the first year of}} college. I do not think Elon University's SAT scores tell all there is to know about Elon. To think so would be falling into the trap of using one single measure as a proxy for the complex nature of any college. Which is precisely why the rankings are flawed." ...|$|E
50|$|Grandson {{of a king}} but {{raised with}} the {{expectation}} of being merely a count, Philip took kingship seriously.

5000|$|Kellar {{supposedly}} {{developed this}} trick by abruptly walking {{onto the stage}} during a levitation show by John Nevil Maskelyne, seeing what <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> and leaving.

60|$|The {{student who}} repairs to them {{sees in the}} list of classes and of professors a fair picture of the world of knowledge. Whatever <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> there is some one ready to teach him, some one {{competent}} to discipline him in the way of learning; whatever his special bent, let him but be able and diligent, and in due time he shall find distinction and a career. Among his professors, he sees men whose names are known and revered throughout the civilised world; and their living example infects him with a noble ambition, and a love for the spirit of work.|$|E
60|$|He was {{not like}} too many now-a-days, who look on prayer, and on inspiration, as old-fashioned superstitions; who believe that a man can find out all <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> by his own unassisted intellect, and then do it by his own unassisted will. Where they get their proofs of that theory, I know not; {{certainly}} not {{from the history of}} mankind, and certainly not from their own experience, unless it be very different from mine. Be that as it may, this old Psalmist would not have agreed with them; for he held an utterly opposite belief. He held that a man could see nothing, unless God shewed it to him. He held that a man could learn nothing unless God taught him; and taught him, moreover, in two ways. First taught him what he ought to do, and then taught him how to do it.|$|E
60|$|There {{is another}} thing to be considered. I believe that the bird, like creatures in other classes, has his {{receptive}} period, his time to learn, and that, like some mammals, he learns everything <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{in his first year}} or two; and that, having acquired his proper song, he adds little or nothing to it thereafter, although the song may increase in power and brilliance when the bird comes to full maturity. This, I think, holds true of all birds, like the nightingale, which have a singing period of two or three months and are songless {{for the rest of the}} year. That long, silent period cannot, so far as sounds go, be a receptive one; the song early in life has become crystallized in the form it will keep through life, and is like an intuitive act. This is not the case with birds like the starling, that sing all the year round--birds that are naturally loquacious and sing instead of screaming and chirping like others. They are always borrowing new sounds and always forgetting.|$|E
50|$|Talon and the French Minister of the Marine Jean-Baptiste Colbert {{had brought}} the colony of New France under direct royal control in 1663, and Colbert wished {{to make it the}} centre of the French colonial empire. <b>To</b> do this <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the state of the population, so that the {{economic}} and industrial basis of the colony could be expanded.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gone. But wait," [...] whispered Jones. He {{knew the}} savage nature, and he <b>knew</b> how <b>to</b> wait. After a long time, he {{cautiously}} {{crawled out of}} the thicket and searched the surroundings with a plainsman's eye. He climbed the slope and saw the clouds of dust, the near one small, the far one large, which told him all <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A {{few days}} later, he {{retracted}} this announcement {{and asked the}} US for scientific advice about whether homosexuality is genetically pre-determined or a choice. <b>He</b> indicated <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> [...] "whether, indeed, {{there are people who}} are born homosexual", in which case it would be wrong to punish them. He said that he would not sign the bill until that matter had been clarified.|$|R
6000|$|Having {{learned all}} that <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> Diomede ruthlessly slays Dolon. Odysseus thanks Athene, and hides the poor spoils of the dead, marking the place. They then creep {{into the dark}} camp of the {{sleeping}} Thracians, and as Diomede slays them Odysseus drags each body aside, to leave a clear path for the horses, {{that they may not}} plunge and tremble when they are led forth, [...] "for they were not yet used to dead men." [...] No line in Homer shows more intimate knowledge and realisation of horses and of war. Odysseus drives the horses of Rhesus out of the camp with the bow of Meriones; he has forgotten to take the whip from the chariot. Diomede, having slain King Rhesus asleep, thinks whether he shall lift out the chariot (war chariots were very light) or drag it by the pole; but Athene warns him to be going. He [...] "springs upon the steeds," [...] and they make for their camp. It is not clearly indicated whether they ride or drive (X., 5 I 3, 527-528, 541); but, suppose that they ride, are we to conclude that the fact proves [...] "lateness"? The heroes always drive in Homer, but it is inconceivable that they could not ride in cases of necessity, as here, if Diomede has thought it wiser not to bring out the chariot and harness the horses. Riding is mentioned in Iliad, XV. 679, in a simile; again, in a simile, Odyssey, V. 37 I. It is not the custom for heroes to ride; the chariot is used in war and in travelling, but, when there are horses and no chariot, men could not be so imbecile as not to mount the horses, nor could the poet be so pedantic as not to make them do so.|$|E

50|$|Sitting in {{the back}} of the classroom, he taught himself Spanish and Italian before {{learning}} French and German at secondary school. When he applied to the University of Edinburgh, he found out <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> a classic language, so he taught himself six years of Latin in a year and won the school’s Latin prize. He found his language books burrowing through secondhand bookstalls at a fish market.|$|R

5000|$|To {{show how}} easy it is to become a critic, Johnson {{describes}} the career of Dick Minim. A former brewer's apprentice, Minim inherited a fortune and [...] "resolved to be a man of wit and humour".

25|$|Augustine {{was from}} the {{beginning}} a brilliant student, with an eager intellectual curiosity, but he never mastered Greek—he tells us that his first Greek teacher was a brutal man who constantly beat his students, and Augustine rebelled and refused to study. By the time he realized that <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Greek, it was too late; and although he acquired a smattering of the language, he was never eloquent with it.
