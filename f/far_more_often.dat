5|$|The book's {{somewhat}} controversial {{argument is}} that evolution in animals (though no doubt similar processes occur in other organisms) proceeds mostly by modifying the way that regulatory genes, which do not code for structural proteins (such as enzymes), control embryonic development. In turn, these regulatory genes {{turn out to be}} based on a very old set of highly conserved genes which Carroll nicknames the toolkit. Almost identical sequences can be found across the animal kingdom, meaning that toolkit genes such as Hox must have evolved before the Cambrian radiation which created most of the animal body plans that exist today. These genes are used and reused, occasionally by duplication but <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> by being applied unchanged to new functions. Thus the same signal may be given at a different time in development, in {{a different part of the}} embryo, creating a different effect on the adult body. In Carroll's view, this explains how so many body forms are created with so few structural genes.|$|E
5|$|Task Group 38.2 {{remained}} off {{the eastern}} coast of Luzon {{for the first}} week of November providing continued support to U.S. Army forces at Leyte. On November 5–6, 1944, Air Group 18 flew sorties against airfields and shipping on southern Luzon. Fighters participated in strafing runs <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> than they engaged in aerial combat. Out of a total of 194 sorties flown by the air group over these two days, two airborne aircraft were destroyed compared with fifty-five on the ground. By this time Japan was reeling from the effects of Operation Cartwheel, which had deprived it of fuel needed to get planes off the ground; its air force was short on experienced and even freshly-trained pilots, who were lost in huge numbers in conflicts like the Battle of the Philippine Sea; and finally, it lacked an effective seagoing navy since the back of the IJN had been broken at the Battle of Leyte Gulf the previous month. These factors, in tandem with a week spent refueling, rearming and re-provisioning at Ulithi between November 7 and 14, limited opportunities for Harris to further run up his score.|$|E

25|$|A further {{advantage}} of PHEVs {{is that they}} have potential to be even more efficient than conventional hybrids because a more limited use of the PHEV's internal combustion engine may allow the engine to be used at closer to its maximum efficiency. While a Prius is likely to convert fuel to motive energy on average at about 30% efficiency (well below the engine's 38% peak efficiency) the engine of a PHEV-70 would be likely to operate <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> near its peak efficiency because the batteries can serve the modest power needs at times when the combustion engine would be forced to run well below its peak efficiency. The actual efficiency achieved depends on losses from electricity generation, inversion, battery charging/discharging, the motor controller and motor itself, the way a vehicle is used (its duty cycle), and the opportunities to recharge by connecting to the electrical grid.|$|E
50|$|Disorganized {{serial killers}} are usually <b>far</b> <b>more</b> impulsive, <b>often</b> {{committing}} their murders with a random weapon {{available at the}} time, and usually do not attempt to hide the body.

Disorganized serial killers have been found to have a slightly lower mean IQ than organized serial killers, at 92.8.|$|R
5|$|The {{first wave}} of the Muslim conquests ended with the siege of Constantinople in 718, and {{the border between the}} two empires became {{stabilized}} along the mountains of eastern Anatolia.

5000|$|Mtshali's {{work was}} popular among white liberals in South Africa, {{which may have}} made him less of an icon for other black poets. In a 1978 interview, the poet Keorapetse Kgositsile compares Mtshali's case to the Harlem Renaissance in the United States, a period when the {{importance}} of white patronage for black work made the emerging black literature more politically complex. [...] Other critics have praised Mtshali's documentation of the struggle of apartheid; poet Dike Okoro (who was born in 1973, and perhaps has a different generational perspective from Kgosistsile's) has said, [...] "Mtshali stands out {{for the role of}} addressing oppression and its effects[...] [...] fear as an element of craft and theme predominates." [...] Mtshali's second book, Fireflames (1980), is <b>far</b> <b>more</b> militant, <b>often</b> expressly promising revolution.|$|R
25|$|Rapid eye {{movement}} sleep (REM) has since its discovery been {{closely associated with}} dreaming. Waking up sleepers during a REM phase is a common experimental method for obtaining dream reports; 80% of neurotypical people can give some kind of dream report under these circumstances. Sleepers awakened from REM tend to give longer more narrative descriptions of the dreams they were experiencing, and to estimate the duration of their dreams as longer. Lucid dreams are reported <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> in REM sleep. (In fact these {{could be considered a}} hybrid state combining essential elements of REM sleep and waking consciousness.) The mental events which occur during REM most commonly have dream hallmarks including narrative structure, convincingness (experiential resemblance to waking life), and incorporation of instinctual themes. Sometimes they include elements of the dreamer's recent experience taken directly from episodic memory. By one estimate, 80% of dreams occur during REM.|$|E
25|$|Regarding invertebrates, the {{burrowing}} owl seems {{less of a}} generalist. It is extremely fond of termites such as Termitidae, and Orthoptera such as Conocephalinae and Copiphorinae katydids, Jerusalem crickets (Stenopelmatidae) and true crickets (Gryllidae). Bothynus and Dichotomius anaglypticus scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae) were eaten <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> than even closely related species by many {{burrowing owl}}s across central São Paulo (Brazil). Similarly, {{it was noted that}} among scorpions Bothriuridae were much preferred, among spiders Lycosidae (wolf spiders), and among millipedes (Diplopoda) certain Diplocheta. Small ground beetles (Carabidae) are eaten in quantity, while larger ones are much less popular as burrowing owl food, perhaps due to the vigorous defense the large species can put up. Burrowing owls are also known to place the fecal matter of large herbivorous mammals around the outside of their burrows to attract dung beetles which are used to provide a steady source of food for the owls.|$|E
25|$|Naas Botha was, without doubt, {{the most}} {{controversial}} Northerns hero ever, because no-one was ever neutral about him. People either loved him or loved to hate him. Just like his predecessor, Hannes Brewis, Botha was a genius at fly-half and the great points machine. Amongst all true Northerns supporters, {{he was one of}} the greatest heroes of all time, however outside Northern Transvaal he was hated, because the supporters of other teams feared him. Botha's popularity was mainly due to his excellence with the boot. He was the greatest match winner SA rugby has ever seen and has a record that speaks for itself. Botha was fetched by Buurman van Zyl from the Tukkies under-20 team, and included him as a 19-year old in the most successful side of the 1970s. It was also Oom Buurman who chose him as captain of the Blue Bulls in 1980 over many other more senior players like Daan du Plessis, Jan Oberholzster and Louis Moolman. His great claim to fame came on the 1981 tour to New Zealand where he had the local public in canter. He was an absolute genius and his insight into and knowledge of the game and its rules, and his ability to motivate players, made him the ideal player-captain. Botha would probably have rewritten the record books <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> had it not been for apartheid, which robbed him of the opportunity to play regular test rugby. He was both a brilliant kicker and a true strategist. He received the SA Rugby Player of the Year award a record 4 times (1979, 1981, 1985 and 1987).|$|E

500|$|When pure-frequency sine tones {{were first}} {{synthesised}} into complex timbres, starting in 1953, combinations using inharmonic relationships (noises) were used <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> than harmonic ones (tones). Tones {{were seen as}} analogous to vowels, and noises to consonants in human speech, and because traditional music had emphasised tones almost exclusively, composers of electronic music saw scope for exploration along the continuum stretching from single, pure (sine) tones to white noise (the densest superimposition of all audible frequencies)—that is, from entirely periodic to entirely aperiodic sound phenomena. In a process opposite to the building up of sine tones into complexes, white noise could be filtered to produce sounds with different bandwidths, called [...] "coloured noises", such as the speech sounds represented in English by sh, f, s, or ch. An early example of an electronic composition composed entirely by filtering white noise {{in this way is}} Henri Pousseur's Scambi (Exchanges), realised at the Studio di Fonologia in Milan in 1957.|$|E
500|$|Along with fibrofolliculomas {{and kidney}} tumors, {{affected}} individuals frequently develop cysts (blebs or bullae) in the subpleural lung base or intraparenchymal space that may rupture and cause an abnormal collection of {{air in the}} chest cavity (pneumothorax), which {{could result in the}} collapse of a lung. The cysts do not cause other symptoms and lung function is usually normal. More than 83% of people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé have cysts, however, the syndrome does not cause conditions like progressive chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or generalized respiratory failure, though it does cause emphysema. Spontaneous, sometimes recurrent, pneumothorax occurs <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> and at a younger age with Birt–Hogg–Dubé [...] than in the unaffected population.

Browne argued, [...] "The music is often mesmerizing, cathartic rock & roll, but it is rock & roll without release, because the band is suspicious of the old-school rock cliches such a release would evoke." [...] NME magazine's John Mulvey had doubts about the record; he concluded, [...] "As a document of a mind in flux – dithering, dissatisfied, unable {{to come to terms}} with sanity – Kurt [...] should be proud of [...] As a follow-up to one of the best records of the past ten years it just isn't quite there." [...] Ben Thompson of The Independent commented that in spite of the album's more abrasive songs, [...] "In Utero is beautiful <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> than it is ugly", and added, [...] "Nirvana have wisely neglected to make the unlistenable punk-rock nightmare they threatened us with." [...] Q magazine felt that the album showcases Cobain's songwriting abilities and wrote, [...] "If this is how Cobain is going to develop, the future is lighthouse-bright". Several critics ranked In Utero as one of the best releases of the year.
