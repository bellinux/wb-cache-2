5|$|Hazlitt found sheer {{delight in}} A Midsummer Night's Dream, {{especially}} relishing its playfully inventive poetry and quoting at length {{several of his}} favourite passages. He also considers how it exhibits the fine discrimination of character to be found everywhere in Shakespeare.

5|$|He then {{falls asleep}} {{continuing}} {{to play the}} note. A dream sequence of the opening scene of the film Chariots of Fire shows the characters running across a beach, though Mr. Bean dreams he is running with them. He begins to fall behind, until he hails a car to overtake all the others. Now running in front, Bean ensures he wins the race on the beach by tripping one of the runners trying to overtake him, whereupon <b>he</b> <b>crosses</b> the line with elation, and then wakes up. Finding {{that the rest of}} the orchestra have stopped playing while he continued his one recurring note, Bean, with encouragement from Rattle, plays an extended flourish and lastly touches a note that makes a flatulent sound, then stops.|$|E
5|$|The {{woman is}} {{revealed}} to be a genie. Stokes is angry that he wasted his first two wishes; Stokes had previously wished for his boss to stop talking (which caused Gilmore's mouth to disappear) and for a boat. The boat, however, was not placed in water and Stokes is still forced {{to pay taxes on}} it. The genie suggests that Anson should give his physically handicapped brother the ability to walk as his third wish; but he instead wishes for the ability to be turned invisible. Anson, now invisible, runs out into the street and is killed by a truck as <b>he</b> <b>crosses</b> the road.|$|E

After the battle, separated from their dragons, he and the girl fall into an ancient underground facility and form a truce to escape. The girl explains that she is an ancient bio-engineered being named Azel, created in the facility and designed to interface with ancient technology.

5|$|With {{relation}} to the human characters, David was conceptualized as not only a surrogate son for Peter Weyland, but {{as a replacement for}} Weyland's estranged daughter, Meredith Vickers. The actress who portrayed Vickers, Charlize Theron, detailed that Ridley Scott perceived Weyland's family and his company, the Weyland Corporation, as being male-dominated, with Vickers' shared DNA being the only attachment. This runs counter to David, who is a synthetic male created to supplant Vickers and uphold the family's patriarchy. Throughout the eight-month rewrite process leading directly into principal photography, Damon Lindelof focused on enhancing David's bondage to Weyland and the Prometheus- despite David being designed to be a surrogate son, he would actually be a proverbial captive to the master and his ship. With Weyland's death {{at the hands of the}} awakened Engineer, David's programming has run its course and every action he takes from thereon out is by his own volition, essentially freeing him. A philosophical element Scott raised about the David 8 model is that he exemplifies the dangers of making an android sentient- with him having the capacity for free will and the ability to create, <b>he</b> <b>crosses</b> a moral boundary that other androids stay within. The contrast between David and the others androids was developed further in , with the creation of the physically identical character Walter, who was made more robotic and unable to create on his own.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} datable {{mention of}} Guinevere (as Guanhumara, with numerous spelling {{variations in the}} surviving manuscripts) is in Geoffrey of Monmouth's pseudo-historical chronicle of ancient British history, the Historia Regum Britanniae, written c. 1136. Geoffrey relates that Guinevere was descended from a noble Roman family and was the ward of Cador, Duke of Cornwall. Arthur leaves her {{in the care of}} his nephew Modredus (Mordred) while <b>he</b> <b>crosses</b> over to Europe {{to go to war with}} the (fictitious) Roman Procurator Lucius Tiberius. While he is absent, Guinevere is seduced by Modredus and marries him, and Modredus declares himself king and takes Arthur's throne; consequently, Arthur returns to Britain and fights Modredus at the fatal Battle of Camlann.|$|E
500|$|At the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con International, Wright {{said he was}} {{intrigued}} by the story's high concept and character. Wright also stressed that the film {{would not be a}} spoof but an action-adventure with some comedic elements and would incorporate both the Hank Pym and Scott Lang incarnations of the character. Wright said that he was looking to [...] "do a prologue where you see Pym as Ant-Man in action in the 60s, in sort of Tales to Astonish mode basically, and then the contemporary, sort of flash-forward, is Scott Lang's story, and how he comes to acquire the suit, how <b>he</b> <b>crosses</b> paths with Hank Pym, and then, in an interesting sort of Machiavellian way, teams up with him." [...] The next February, Wright said that the project was in [...] "a holding pattern" [...] while the script was being revised, and that he had been doing research for the film by studying nanotechnology. In March 2008, Wright said that the first draft of the script had been completed and he was working on the second.|$|E

See [...] With the implementation of the Decision Review System, a signal may also be revoked if the Third Umpire reports that his review supports reversing the call.|$|E
2500|$|Colin Raimes (Michael Bertolini) — Suspected serial killer. Sam and Maya are {{hunting down}} Raimes for {{kidnapping}} and murdering young women. After a chase and a fight scene, he is apprehended, but released {{because of a}} seemingly solid alibi. Maya trails him {{in the park and}} she is abducted. Sam races to Raimes' apartment, and as <b>he</b> <b>crosses</b> the street, he is hit by a car and wakes up in 1973. [...] When in 1973 (during the first episode of the series), Sam meets Raimes as a child and has thoughts of shooting him so he doesn't {{grow up to be a}} killer; however a message from Maya over the car radio tells Sam that she's alive and safe; Sam puts his gun away and lets Colin return home.

2500|$|At the show's outset in 2008, he cohabits {{with his}} girlfriend who is also his NYPD {{assigned}} partner, Detective Maya Daniels. Maya, to Tyler's horror, is kidnapped by a murderer they are investigating. While responding to a radio call as <b>he</b> <b>crosses</b> the street, Tyler is distracted and hit by another responding speeding police car. He regains consciousness {{in the same spot}} in the year 1973, dressed in period civilian attire, carrying a period-accurate identity card with his badge, and equipped with a vintage automobile, a 1971 Chevrolet Chevelle — and, astonishingly, he's parked within sight of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. He returns to his precinct house to find an unfamiliar early-1970s police squad, with contemporary equipment and culture which he likens to finding himself on a different planet. However, the detectives have been expecting him, thinking that he is a transfer from a place called [...] "Hyde".

As a final farewell, he places a mural-sized [...] "DICK"tation on the roof closest to the school entrance, and we see him walking away with his friends for the last time, insulting a driver as <b>he</b> <b>crosses</b> the road and then further agitating that driver by breakdancing with Leon in the road.|$|E
2500|$|Susie Greene (Susie Essman) – Jeff's shrill but {{ultimately}} good-hearted wife, {{known for her}} explosive temper and her filthy mouth. Consequently, her reactions to Larry range from near violence via benign grievances to occasionally fonder repartee. Able to put two and two together, she frequently catches Larry and Jeff in plans gone awry or cover-up of [...] some misbehavior. She routinely berates Larry and Jeff with profanity-laced tirades after uncovering one of their schemes. Susie and Jeff have an [...] "on-again, off-again" [...] relationship. She often uses Larry as a scapegoat for her marital problems. She is known to refer to Larry as [...] "Larry Fucking David" [...] and [...] "Four-Eyed Fuck," [...] and when <b>he</b> <b>crosses</b> her, she is known to respond [...] "Fuck you, Larry David!" [...] while her common expletive to her husband is [...] "You fat piece of shit!"

Susie Essman was upgraded from guest star billing to main cast billing beginning with season eight.|$|E
2500|$|In the sacristy, before vesting, {{all three}} sacred ministers (priest celebrant, deacon, and subdeacon) wash their hands. The sacred ministers recite certain prayers while they place on each vestment. First, the amice (a {{rectangular}} cloth of linen with long strings for tying) is kissed (if it is embroidered with a cross) and then placed {{on top of}} the head briefly while reciting one of the prayers during vesting. Then it is tied around the shoulders {{on top of the}} cassock (or on top of the habit, if the sacred ministers belongs to a religious order with one). Next the alb (a long linen tunic with sleeves) is put on. The cincture (in Latin, cinctura), a long cloth cord also called a girdle, is then tied around the waist. The subdeacon then completes his vesting by placing the maniple (an embroidered piece of fabric, folded in half, with a cross in the middle) on his left arm (provided there is no Asperges or other liturgical ceremony before Mass begins), securing it either with pins or with the ribbons or elastic inside, and then the tunicle (an embroidered tunic with short sleeves) over all. The deacon places his stole (a long narrow embroidered piece of cloth, similar to the maniple but of greater length) over his left shoulder and binds it in place, at his right hip, with the cincture or girdle. He then puts on the maniple and his dalmatic (similar to the tunicle). The priest celebrant does the same except that <b>he</b> <b>crosses</b> his stole in front of him at the waist, binding it with the girdle or cincture. After the maniple he puts on a cope (a long, heavy embroidered cape) if the Mass is preceded by the Asperges (sprinkling the congregation with holy water). [...] Following the Asperges, the celebrant, assisted by the acolytes, removes the cope and puts on the chasuble (similar to the tunicle, but without sleeves and usually with an embroidered cross or image on the back).|$|E
