25|$|The gradual {{abandonment}} of naturalism and {{the depiction of}} realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the twentieth century, Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937) used arresting cubist techniques and stark monochromatic oils, to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. Leon Golub's Interrogation III (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. Andres Serrano's Piss Christ (1989) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>photograph</b> of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing Christ's sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract An {{image that}} appears to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>photograph</b> may not {{necessarily}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> normal <b>photograph</b> as we know it. For example, a photograph-like image can be rendered by computer graphics instead of being taken by a camera or it can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>photograph</b> of <b>an</b> image instead of <b>a</b> direct <b>photograph</b> of <b>a</b> natural scene. What is really different between these photographic appearances is their underlying synthesis processes. Not being able to distinguish these images poses real social risks, as it becomes harder to refute claims of child pornography as non-photograph {{in the court of}} law and easier for attackers to mount an image or video replay attack on biometric security systems. This motivates digital image forensics research on distinguishing these photograph-like images from true photographs. In this chapter, we present the challenges, technical approaches, system design, and other practical issues in tackling this multimedia forensics problem. We will also share a list of the open resources and the potential future research directions in this area of research which we hope readers will find useful. ...|$|R
25|$|According to Krakauer, a well-nourished {{person might}} consume {{the seeds and}} survive because the body can use its stores of glucose and amino acids to rid itself of the poison. Since McCandless lived on a diet of rice, lean meat, and wild plants and had less than 10% body fat when he died, Krakauer {{hypothesized}} that McCandless was likely unable {{to fend off the}} toxins. However, when the Eskimo potatoes from the area around the bus were later tested in a laboratory of the University of Alaska Fairbanks by Dr. Thomas Clausen, toxins were not found. Krakauer later modified his hypothesis, suggesting that mold of the variety Rhizoctonia leguminicola may have caused McCandless's death. Rhizoctonia leguminicola is known to cause digestion problems in livestock, and may have aided McCandless's impending starvation. Krakauer hypothesised that the bag in which Chris kept the potato seeds was damp and the seeds thus became moldy. If McCandless had eaten seeds that contained this mold, he could have become sick, and Krakauer suggests that he thus became unable {{to get out of bed}} and so starved. His basis for the mold hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>photograph</b> that shows seeds in a bag. Following chemical analysis of the seeds, Krakauer now believes that the seeds themselves are poisonous.|$|E
