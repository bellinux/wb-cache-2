5|$|Mr. Thompson Seton says {{in capital}} letters that his stories are true, {{and it is}} this {{emphatic}} assertion that makes the judicious grieve. True as romance, true in their artistic effects, true in their power to entertain the young reader, they certainly are but true as natural history they as certainly are not... There are no stories of animal intelligence and cunning on record, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> of, that match his.|$|E
500|$|These {{birds are}} closely allied in {{appearance}} to the Thenca of Chile or Callandra of la Plata. ... In each Isld. each kind is exclusively found: habits of all are indistinguishable. When I recollect, {{the fact that}} the form of the body, shape of scales & general size, the Spaniards can at once pronounce, from which Island any Tortoise may have been brought. When I see these Islands in sight of each other, & [...] possessed of but a scanty stock of animals, tenanted by these birds, but slightly differing in structure & filling the same place in Nature, I must suspect they are only varieties.The only fact of a similar kind of which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware,</b> is the constant asserted difference — between the wolf-like Fox of East & West Falkland Islds. If there is the slightest foundation for these remarks the zoology of Archipelagoes — will be well worth examining; for such facts [...] undermine the stability of Species.|$|E

In a behind-the-scenes video, Mars explained, [...] "The {{concept of the}} video is my struggle, to tell this girl I'd do anything for her, so I'm going as far as dragging a piano {{to get to her}} just so I can sing my heart out." [...] Mars, sarcastically, replied to rumors related to the use of special effects: [...] "A lot of people think this is a camera trick, but that is a heavy piano. Luckily, I’ve been doing about, you know, 800 to 967 push-ups every day, so it’s not a big deal, I can handle it." [...] Regardless, this achievement, Mars was cautious: [...] "The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> of the power of visual media, and I encourage everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate".|$|E

500|$|The poem {{most likely}} {{originated}} in the poetry that Gray composed in 1742. William Mason, in Memoirs, discussed his friend Gray and the origins of Elegy: [...] "I am inclined {{to believe that the}} Elegy in a Country Church-yard was begun, if not concluded, at this time [...] also: Though <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> that as it stands at present, the conclusion is of a later date; how that was originally I shall show in my notes on the poem." [...] Mason's argument was a guess, but he argued that one of Gray's poems from the Eton Manuscript, a copy of Gray's handwritten poems owned by Eton College, was a 22-stanza rough draft of the Elegy called [...] "Stanza's Wrote in a Country Church-Yard". The manuscript copy contained many ideas which were reworked and revised as he attempted to work out the ideas that would later form the Elegy. A later copy was entered into Gray's commonplace book and a third version, included in an 18 December 1750 letter, was sent to Thomas Wharton. The draft sent to Walpole was subsequently lost.|$|E
500|$|On November 24, 2015, Frusciante {{announced}} that he was releasing free unreleased songs dating from 2008-2013 on his own official Bandcamp and SoundCloud pages. He also debunked the interview about him retiring from the music industry, saying that his words were taken out of context. The announcement was made via Frusciante's rarely updated website in an open letter titled [...] "Hello audience," [...] where Frusciante provides an in-depth response to the reporter who, according to him, misquoted him. He writes, [...] "I also must clear something up. I normally don’t read my press, but I heard about this quote, recently taken out of context by some lame website and made into a headline, in which I said 'I have no audience'. This has been misinterpreted, and by no fault of the excellent journalist who interviewed me for the fine publication Electronic Beats. [...] Obviously I have a public audience. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> of them, and they know who they are." [...] He continues, [...] "Reduced to a single sentence, it would have been accurate to say that, at this point, I have no particular audience in mind while I am making music." ...|$|E
500|$|... Darwin's {{belief that}} black people had the same {{essential}} humanity as Europeans, and had many mental similarities, was reinforced by the lessons he had from John Edmonstone in 1826. Early in the Beagle voyage, Darwin nearly lost {{his position on the}} ship when he criticised FitzRoy's defence and praise of slavery. [...] He wrote home about [...] "how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro character." [...] Regarding Fuegians, he [...] "could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement", but he knew and liked civilised Fuegians like Jemmy Button: [...] "It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here." ...|$|E

500|$|The Aggies {{won only}} one game against seven defeats in 1928. [...] In late November, {{the day after}} a 46–0 loss to Oklahoma, {{newspapers}} reported that [...] "reliable sources" [...] had said Maulbetsch intended to resign. [...] Maulbetsch immediately denied the rumor, saying: [...] "I have not resigned. [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> that a faction here {{is trying to get}} me out, but I do not intend to throw up the sponge." [...] In December, pressure to fire Maulbetsch grew, and one Oklahoma newspaper observed: [...] "Coach Maulbetsch of the A. & M. football team is the object of attacks from many sides because of the rather poor showing made by his team during the past season. [...] They are looking for a goat and just now Johnnie is cast in that role. [...] Regardless of his past record, those who demand victory at any price and by any means whatsoever, are insisting that he be fired forthwith and a man be placed in the position who, by fair means or foul, will gather in a team that will win victories and never lose a game." [...] Ultimately, Maulbetsch resigned at the end of May 1929 as Oklahoma A's coach in football, baseball, and basketball. [...] It was announced that he would spend the remaining year of his contract on a leave of absence at half pay.|$|E

2500|$|By 2002, Onyango {{had already}} applied for {{political}} asylum when she applied for public housing in Boston. She {{moved into the}} apartment, run by Massachusetts authorities, after back surgery made walking difficult. A Boston Housing Authority official said that the agency was never notified that a deportation order had been issued against Onyango after the government denied her request for asylum. William McGonigle, {{deputy director of the}} Boston Housing Authority, said, [...] "We have no affirmative responsibility <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> of to further check on their [...] status after they are initially deemed to be eligible."(A 1977 federal consent decree, resulting from a class action lawsuit in Waltham, prohibits state officials from denying public housing to illegal immigrants).|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, the Law Commission {{proposed}} that the Dockyards etc. Protection Act 1772 be abolished in its draft Criminal Damage Bill {{as part of an}} update of the law on criminal damage. The reasoning was that the law was no longer required for its original purposes, as warships were no longer made of flammable materials. The resulting Criminal Damage Act received royal assent from Queen Elizabeth II in 1971 and the offence of arson in royal dockyards was abolished. In a speech in the House of Lords in 1998, Lord Goodhart stated that the dockyard arson offence disappeared from the list of capital crimes in 1971 [...] "without, so far as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware,</b> either comment or concern." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{compared}} the Australian situation with America, New Zealand, Jamaica and Saint Vincent, Judge Willis then drew a {{contrast with the}} areas under the British Raj. Those territories, he said, were certainly claimed by conquest, yet [...] "the unchristian practice of Suttees and the Jughernaut were permitted to prevail"; but more pointedly, the Charter Act 1833 expressly gave the Governor-General of India powers to make, alter and repeal laws for both British and native inhabitants of India. [...] "There is", the Judge said, [...] "no express law, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> of, that makes the Aborigines subject to our colonial code." [...] He then recalled Barry's argument with respect to local alcohol and firearms laws.|$|E

Dorothea Lange was named Dorothea Margaretta Nutzhorn at birth. She had a younger brother, Martin. She dropped her middle name and assumed her mother's maiden name {{after her father}} abandoned the family when she was 12 years old, one of two traumatic incidents early in her life. The other was her contraction of polio at age seven which left her with a weakened right leg and a permanent limp. [...] "It formed me, guided me, instructed me, helped me and humiliated me," [...] Lange once said of her altered gait.

2500|$|The preparations, and {{the many}} works of art {{commissioned}} for or inspired by the Eglinton Tournament, {{had an effect on}} public feeling and the course of 19th-century Gothic revivalism. Its ambition carried over to events such as the lavish Tournament of Brussels in 1905, and presaged the historical reenactments of the present. Features of the tournament were actually inspired by [...] Walter Scott's novel Ivanhoe: it was attempting [...] "to be a living re-enactment of the literary romances". In Eglinton’s own words [...] "I am aware of the manifold deficiencies in its exhibition— more perhaps than those who were not so deeply interested in it; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> that it was a very humble imitation of the scenes which my imagination had portrayed, but I have, at least, done something towards the revival of chivalry".|$|E
2500|$|During a {{counter-insurgency}} seminar {{conducted by}} Sri Lanka Army in June 2011, Lawrence Smith - an attaché of the American embassy in Sri Lanka from 2008 revealed [...] "...from what I was privileged {{to hear and}} to see, the offers to surrender that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> of {{seemed to come from}} the mouthpieces of the LTTE -- Nadesan, KP -- people who weren't and never had really demonstrated any control over the leadership or the combat power of the LTTE. So their offers were a bit suspect anyway, and they tended to vary in content hour by hour, day by day. I think we need to examine the credibility of those offers before we leap to conclusions that such offers were in fact real..." [...] However the US State Department characterized the statement as [...] "personal opinion".|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{belief in}} God {{has often been}} {{advanced}} as not only the greatest, but the most complete of all the distinctions between man and the lower animals. It is however impossible, as we have seen, to maintain that this belief is innate or instinctive in man. On the other hand a belief in all-pervading spiritual agencies seems to be universal; and apparently follows from a considerable advance in man's reason, and from a still greater advance in his faculties of imagination, curiosity and wonder. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>aware</b> that the assumed instinctive belief in God {{has been used by}} many persons as an argument for His existence. But this is a rash argument, as we should thus be compelled to believe in the existence of many cruel and malignant spirits, only a little more powerful than man; for the belief in them is far more general than in a beneficent Deity. The idea of a universal and beneficent Creator does not seem to arise in the mind of man, until he has been elevated by long-continued culture." ...|$|E

From time to time, drowsily, I stirred--please, my reader, don't miss that verb--I STIRRED. I moved my legs, my arms. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> of clean, soft bed linen against my skin. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> of bodily well-being. Oh, it was delicious! As thirsting men on the desert dream of {{splashing}} fountains and flowing wells, so dreamed I of easement from the constriction of the jacket, of cleanliness in the place of filth, of smooth velvety skin of health in place of my poor parchment-crinkled hide.

2500|$|In 1993, Sir Colin Hope stated: [...] "...he {{factory in}} {{question}} was not owned or operated by this Company. It was {{owned and operated by}} a company known as J.W.
