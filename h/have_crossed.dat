5|$|The outer {{boundary}} of the heliosphere, the heliopause, is {{the point at which}} the solar wind finally terminates and is the beginning of interstellar space. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are reported to have passed the termination shock and entered the heliosheath, at 94 and 84AU from the Sun, respectively. Voyager 1 is reported to <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> the heliopause in August 2012.|$|E
5|$|According to modern-day analysis, a {{tropical}} depression {{developed in the}} Pacific Ocean, south of El Salvador, early on September 27. It drifted northward across Central America and eastern Mexico before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico near Ciudad del Carmen on September 30. Weather reports had indicated low air pressures over the area for several days. It is relatively rare for {{a tropical}} cyclone to cross from the Pacific into the Atlantic, or vice versa, and this storm is among less than a dozen known to have officially done so. Only three other tropical cyclones <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> from the eastern Pacific into the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|However, Markham {{had second}} thoughts, {{and was soon}} writing to the current RGS president, Leonard Darwin, to express disbelief about Shackleton's claimed latitudes, repeating these doubts to Scott. Historians have surmised that Scott was Markham's protégé, and {{that the old man}} resented polar glory going to someone else. Whatever his reason, Markham adopted a {{bitterness}} towards Shackleton which he retained {{for the rest of his}} life. He is said to <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> out all favourable references to Shackleton in his own notes on the Discovery expedition, and to have virtually ignored Shackleton's achievements in a 1912 address to the British Association. He was equally dismissive in his history of Antarctic exploration, The Lands of Silence (published posthumously in 1921).|$|E

5|$|On September13, 1966, NY111 was realigned {{south of}} Hauppauge {{to follow a}} {{slightly}} more westerly alignment to the hamlet of Islip along Joshua's Path and Islip Avenue, two streets that ran parallel to the route's original path on Carleton Avenue and Wheeler Road. Ownership and maintenance of NY111's former routing was transferred to Suffolk County, which redesignated the road as CR17. The ultimately cancelled eastern extension of the Northern State Parkway would <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> NY111 just south of Village of the Branch at a point north of Mount Pleasant Road. An interchange between the parkway and NY111 was planned at that location.|$|E
5|$|People {{displaced}} by the 2010 earthquake are at {{an increased risk of}} sex trafficking and forced labor. The international protections in place for the internally displaced, primarily the 1998 United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, do not apply to earthquake survivors who <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> an international border. There is nothing protecting the externally displaced, which creates significant protection gaps for those most vulnerable to trafficking—girls and young women—who are treated as migration offenders rather than forced migrants in need of protection. No temporary protected status has been created or granted in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|Some {{events and}} their timing are unclear during this early period. Sources {{disagree}} {{on whether he}} brought his family to California from Illinois in 1852 or 1854. Carranco dates Seth's first return to Illinois starting in 1850, with his return to California in August 1852, his arrival in Humboldt County in February 1853, another return to Illinois in September 1853, and a trip back to California starting in May 1854 with his mother, two children, and a herd of cattle. Thus, {{in the course of}} the six years 1849-1854, he is believed to <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> the Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains five times, travelling mostly on foot.|$|E

5|$|The Causeway Bay Books disappearances are {{a series}} of {{international}} disappearances concerning five staff members of Causeway Bay Books, located in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong. Between October and December 2015, five staff of Causeway Bay Books went missing. At least two of them disappeared in mainland China, one in Thailand. One member was last seen in Hong Kong, and eventually revealed to be in Shenzhen, across the Chinese border, without the travel documents necessary to <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> the border through legal channels.|$|E
5|$|The exact route {{taken by}} Odaenathus from Palmyra to Ctesiphon remains uncertain; it is {{probably}} similar to the route emperor Julian took in 363 during his campaign against Persia. Using this route, Odaenathus would <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> the Euphrates at Zeugma then moved east to Edessa followed by Carrhae then Nisibis; here, he would have descended south along the Khabur River to the Euphrates valley and marched alongside the river's left bank to Nehardea. After taking the city, he penetrated the Sassanian province of Asōristān and marched along the royal canal Naarmalcha towards the Tigris where the Persian capital stood.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{headed by}} Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette in 1673, though {{probably not the}} first Europeans to visit the area, are the first recorded to <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> the Chicago Portage and travelled along the Chicago River. Marquette returned in 1674, camped a few days {{near the mouth of}} the river, then moved on to the portage, where he stayed through the winter of 1674–75. Joliet and Marquette did not report any Indians living near the Chicago River area at this time, though archaeologists have since discovered numerous Indian village sites elsewhere in the Chicago area. Two of La Salle's men built a stockade at the portage in the winter of 1682/1683.|$|E

5|$|Convinced {{that the}} grounds were haunted, {{they decided to}} publish their {{findings}} in a book An Adventure (1911) under the pseudonyms of Elizabeth Morison and Frances Lamont. The book, containing the claim that Marie Antoinette had been encountered in 1901, caused a sensation. However, many critics did not take it seriously {{on the grounds of}} the implausibilities and inconsistencies that it was thought to contain. A review of the book by Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research suggested that the women had misinterpreted normal events that they had experienced. In 1903, an old map of the Trianon gardens was found and showed a bridge that the two women had claimed to <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> that had not been on any other map. The identity of the authors of An Adventure was not made public until 1931.|$|E
5|$|Drama in {{the early}} 20th century thrived, but the country failed to produce a Welsh National Theatre company. After the Second World War the {{substantial}} number of amateur companies that had existed before the outbreak of hostilities reduced by two thirds. The increasing competition from television in the 1950s and 1960s led to a need for greater professionalism in the theatre. As a result, plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton, Rachel Roberts, Donald Houston and Stanley Baker, were establishing themselves as artistic talents. Anthony Hopkins was an alumnus of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama, and has since starred in Hollywood films.John Rhys-Davies is another well known actor, famous for his portrayal of Gimli in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the charismatic Arab excavator Sallah in the Indiana Jones films. Other Welsh actors to <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> the Atlantic more recently include: Ioan Gruffudd; Rhys Ifans; Matthew Rhys; Michael Sheen; and Catherine Zeta-Jones.|$|E

5|$|Lansford W. Hastings, {{an early}} {{immigrant}} from Ohio to the West, went to California in 1842 {{and saw the}} promise of the undeveloped country. To encourage settlers, he published The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California. He described a direct route across the Great Basin which would bring immigrants through the Wasatch Mountains and across the Great Salt Lake Desert. Hastings had not traveled any part of his proposed shortcut until early 1846 on a trip from California to Fort Bridger. The fort was a scant supply station run by Jim Bridger and his partner Pierre Louis Vasquez in Blacks Fork, Wyoming. Hastings stayed at the fort to persuade travelers to turn south on his route. As of 1846, Hastings was the second of two men documented to <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> {{the southern part of the}} Great Salt Lake Desert, but neither had been accompanied by wagons.|$|E
5|$|Reading {{reversed}} their defeat to Sunderland {{previously in}} the season by winning 2–1 on 22 December. Reading had led 1–0 after a 69th-minute goal from Ívar Ingimarsson. Michael Chopra levelled the match by scoring an 82nd-minute penalty. A goal by Stephen Hunt in the 90th minute sparked controversy as it appeared not to <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> the line. Sunderland met Manchester United on Boxing Day at the Stadium of Light, they were beaten 4–0 in a game were Sunderland striker Martyn Waghorn made the step up from the club's Youth system to the first team. Martyn Waghorn promoted to first team from Youth system. Sunderland ended 2007 with a 3–1 home win to Bolton Wanderers on 29 December, Kieran Richardson, Kenwyne Jones and Daryl Murphy were the scorers.|$|E
5|$|United {{responded to}} the goal immediately, as Giggs made a surging run through the Barcelona defence before playing the ball to Berbatov in the inside-right channel. The Bulgarian forward's low cross found Giggs in the centre, and the United captain's shot was {{deflected}} to Ronaldo {{on the far side}} of the goal, only for the Portuguese's shot to be blocked by Valdés. The resulting corner reached Berbatov {{on the far side of}} the goal, but it was deemed to <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> the goal line first and Barcelona were awarded a goal kick, from which they launched another attack. Messi played a through-ball to Puyol on the right flank, but as the Barcelona captain reached the goal line, he was fouled by Ronaldo, who – despite going in two-footed – escaped the referee's book. Puyol himself rose to head Xavi's free kick towards goal, but it was directly at Van der Sar, who claimed the ball easily.|$|E

5|$|With {{the breed}} that carries his name, John Sebright {{intentionally}} {{set out to}} create a very small bantam chicken with laced plumage similar to the laced variety of Polish chickens. Although the exact makeup of the breed is uncertain, he is thought to <b>have</b> <b>crossed</b> British, Hamburgh, Nankin and Polish birds with a base of Rosecombs before achieving a laced chicken that would breed true. After the breed's establishment circa 1810, Sebright founded The Sebright Bantam Club, which was the very first individual breed association for chickens. The breed {{has appeared in the}} American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection since the first edition in 1874. Today, the breed is one of the ten most popular bantam chickens, according to the American Bantam Association.|$|E
