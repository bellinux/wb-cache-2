If you do not agree to see my friend Lord Etherington, ay, and to receive him with the politeness due to the {{consideration}} I entertain for him, by Heaven! Clara, I will no longer regard you as my father's daughter. Think what you are giving up--the affection and protection of a brother--and for what?--merely for an <b>idle</b> <b>point</b> of etiquette.--You cannot, I suppose, even in the workings of your romantic brain, imagine that the days of Clarissa Harlowe and Harriet Byron are come back again, when women were married by main force? and it is monstrous vanity in you to suppose that Lord Etherington, since he has honoured you with any thoughts at all, will not be satisfied with a proper and civil refusal--You are no such prize, methinks, that the days of romance are {{to come back for}} you." ...|$|E
5000|$|On June 10, 2014, Kevin Hayes {{was issued}} U.S. Patent 8,749,310 for [...] "amplifier bias control." [...] This patent covers {{the only known}} {{technique}} for observing the true underlying quiescent current (idle current) of an output tube (or transistor) under dynamic signal conditions, and then holding it to the stable target value with a precision of 99% or better. It is the only 'auto bias' {{system in which the}} volume and character of the music being played does not alter the <b>idle</b> <b>point</b> of the tube. It is incorporated in VAC power amplifiers as the iQ Intelligent Continuous Automatic Bias System. In addition, the iQ system defends against short circuit tubes, prevents gas current run away tubes, indicates weakening tubes, and minimizes noise and distortion. Current iQ models are the VAC Statement 450 iQ and Signature 200 iQ.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The way {{in which}} a vehicle is driven {{significantly}} affects its fuel consumption. This paper analyses the fuel-optimal driving strategies of a traditional vehicle equipped with a con-tinuously variable transmission in car-following scenarios. A minimal-fuel-consumption prob-lem is formulated, which is numerically solved using the Gauss pseudospectral method. The identified optimal manoeuvres were found to demonstrate two types of behaviour depending on the vehicle speed: pulse-and-gliding (PnG) and constant speed (CS). Further analyses indi-cate that the difference in behaviours mainly depends on the engine fuelling characteristics (both static and transient) and the road load. As the preceding vehicle’s speed increases, the optimal manoeuvre changes from partial PnG to full PnG, and finally to CS. In the full-PnG strategy, the engine switches between the minimum brake specific fuel consumption <b>point</b> and the <b>idling</b> <b>point</b> while the range error oscillates between its upper and lower bounds. The period, duty cycle percentage, and fuel economy improvement of the PnG strategy are ana-lysed and presented...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the fuel-efficient design of vehicles, eco-driving technologies can further reduce the fuel consumption and carbon emissions of road transportation. One of the major issues in eco-driving technologies is how to determine the fuel savings or fuel-optimised operating strategies of the power train. We examine the periodic operation of autonomous vehicles in free-driving scenarios {{with the purpose of}} maximising fuel economy. The design of such strategies can be considered to be an optimal control problem, which is proved by -test to have singular arcs because of the S-shaped engine fueling rate. The optimal operations are solved numerically by using the Legendre pseudospectral method, and many are found to demonstrate periodic behaviours, that is, pulse and gliding. In periodic operation, the engine switches between the minimum break specific fuel consumption <b>point</b> and the <b>idling</b> <b>point,</b> while the vehicle speed oscillates between its upper and lower bounds. The formation of periodic operation, as well as some key properties, is analysed and presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Transport {{protocol}} such as RTP and TFRC {{take control}} of sending rate by feedback-controls which measure RTT, packet loss rate, etc. On wireless LANs, the communication condition changes drastically when a node hands over from an <b>idle</b> access <b>point</b> to a congested one. However, the node keeps measured values after the handover. Because of this, the node {{may not be able}} to control the sending rate accurately. In this paper, we present the result of simulations of DCCP CCID 3 data streams adopting TFRC focused on disconnection period due to heavy loaded wireless LAN handover. We also propose schemes to avoid the effect of handovers and evaluate them. Key words: TCP friendly rate control, wireless LANs, handover...|$|R
50|$|In modern designs it {{is common}} to find two load units, one store (many {{instructions}} have no results to store), two or more integer math units, two or more floating point units, and often a SIMD unit of some sort. The instruction issue logic grows in complexity by reading in a huge list of instructions from memory and handing them off to the different execution units that are <b>idle</b> at that <b>point.</b> The results are then collected and re-ordered at the end.|$|R

40|$|The tandem loop with {{multiple}} vehicles (TLMV) configuration is proposed {{as a new}} and effective alternative for automated guided vehicle systems. The TLMV configuration is useful for a large scale manufacturing environment since it can easily accommodate expansion or upgrade while still being less sensitive to vehicle failure than the tandem loop (single vehicle) configuration. Simulation {{results show that the}} TLMV configuration is a viable option. For the TLMV layout, a polynomial time algorithm to determine optimal <b>idle</b> vehicle dwell <b>points</b> is developed for the objective of minimizing the mean weighted response time...|$|R

40|$|Determining the {{shortest}} path for a vehicle moving {{on a network}} is easy. If more vehicles share the same network resources and we want vehicles to reach their destinations as soon as possible, moving on shortest paths {{might not be the}} optimal solution. In fact, conflicts may arise, requiring some vehicles to stay <b>idle</b> at some <b>point</b> of {{the shortest}} path: choosing an appropriate schedule on different paths may be quicker. The problem of finding the best set of conflict-free paths and schedule arises in many contexts: the coordination of automated guided vehicles, the management of airport groundside traffic, etc. After defining the general problem and proving its NP-hardness, we give a polynomial optimal dispatching algorithm for grids...|$|R
40|$|Green WLAN is a {{promising}} technique for accessing future indoor Internet services. It is designed {{not only for}} high-speed data communication purposes but also for energy efficiency. The basic strategy of green WLAN {{is that all the}} access points are not always powered on, but rather work on-demand. Though powering off <b>idle</b> access <b>points</b> does not affect data communication, a serious asymmetric matching problem will arise in a WLAN indoor positioning system due to the fact the received signal strength (RSS) readings from the available access points are different in their offline and online phases. This asymmetry problem will no doubt invalidate the fingerprint algorithm used to estimate the mobile device location. Therefore, in this paper we propose a green WLAN indoor positioning system, which can recover RSS readings and achieve good localization performance based on singular value thresholding (SVT) theory. By solving the nuclear norm minimization problem, SVT recovers not only the radio map, but also online RSS readings from a sparse matrix by sensing {{only a fraction of the}} RSS readings. We have implemented the method in our lab and evaluated its performances. The experimental results indicate the proposed system could recover the RSS readings and achieve good localization performance...|$|R
40|$|Wastewater minimisation {{in batch}} {{processes}} is becoming evermore important as environmental legislation becomes more stringent and fresh water sources are becoming scarce. Added to this, {{is the need}} for batch plants to occupy the least amount of space. Therefore, one would like to minimise any storage in a batch process, since storage takes up a large amount of space with relatively low economic return. Generally, in any batch process there are processing vessels that are <b>idle</b> at some <b>point</b> during a given time horizon. In essence, any processing vessel standing idle {{can be used as a}} storage vessel. Under correct conditions, the idle processing vessels can be used as storage for wastewater. This would mean that the size of dedicated wastewater storage is reduced and in some cases not even required. Furthermore, the capital utilisation of the installed processing vessels is greatly increased. Past wastewater minimisation methodologies in batch processes (Wang & Smith, 1995, Kim & Smith, 2004, Foo et al., 2005; Majozi, 2005) have generally accepted that there will always be storage vessels dedicated to the storage of wastewater. The usage of wastewater storage allows for greater reuse opportunities since it enables the inherent time constraint o...|$|R
