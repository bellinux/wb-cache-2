The income, relative import price and foreign exchange rate elasticities of investment <b>good</b> <b>import</b> are found less elastic than the related elasticities of intermediate <b>good</b> <b>import.</b> Investment and intermediate <b>good</b> <b>imports</b> increase as export increases.

5000|$|Tariffs: Typically, tariffs (or taxes) {{are imposed}} on <b>imported</b> <b>goods.</b> Tariff rates usually vary {{according}} to the type of <b>goods</b> <b>imported.</b> Import tariffs will increase the cost to importers, and increase the price of <b>imported</b> <b>goods</b> in the local markets, thus lowering the quantity of <b>goods</b> <b>imported,</b> to favour local producers. Tariffs may also be imposed on exports, and in an economy with floating exchange rates, export tariffs have similar effects as import tariffs. However, since export tariffs are often perceived as [...] "hurting" [...] local industries, while import tariffs are perceived as [...] "helping" [...] local industries, export tariffs are seldom implemented.|$|R

The research method employed was descriptive analysis, because it describes the condition of a research object studied and obtained through collecting completely the primary, secondary data and document taken from the research location. In addition, methods of collecting data employed were interview, library research, and observation. From the result of research, it can be found that the <b>import</b> <b>goods</b> settlement process through manually <b>goods</b> <b>import</b> notification (PIB) document in madya (medium) type of Semarang Customs Supervising and Service Office is regulated based on the Decree of Customs General Director Number: KEP- 68 /BC/ 2003.

Empirical analysis is performed on the United States and 34 partnering countries from 2000 to 2013. Our econometric model fits the data well, explaining 52 % {{of the variation in}} trade flows for goods trade, 53. 2 % of the variation in trade flows for goods export and 48 % of the variation in trade flows for <b>goods</b> <b>import.</b> For every 10 % increase in fixed broadband Internet subscribers per 100 people increases, goods trade by 7. 9 % and for every 5 % increase in fixed broadband Internet subscribers per 100 people, goods export increases by 11 %. For every 1 % increase in fixed telephone line penetration per 100 people, goods trade increases by 26. 3 %, goods export increases by 24. 4 % and <b>goods</b> <b>import</b> increases by 24. 8 %. For every 1 % increase in mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions, goods trade decreases by 29. 6 % and goods export decreases by 27. 1 %, whilst for every 0. 01 % increase in mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions, <b>goods</b> <b>import</b> decreases by 34. 3 %. For every 1 % increase in the percentage of population who used the Internet from any location in the last 12 months Internet, goods trade increases by 32. 5 %, goods export increases by 38. 9 %, <b>goods</b> <b>import</b> increases by 33 %.

Using Johansen cointegration method and VAR methodology, the effect of knowledge transfer through foreign trade on economic growth is investigated in terms of direction and dimension. The estimations reveal that knowledge transfer through capital and intermediate <b>goods</b> <b>imports</b> has no significant effect on economic growth of Turkey in the period investigated.
