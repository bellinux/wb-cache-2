Despite the move to replacing cytotoxic antineoplastics (standard anticancer drugs) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors sometimes hydroxyurea is still used to counteract the high leukocyte counts encountered during treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib; in these situations it may be the preferred myelosuppressive agent due to its relative lack of leukemogenic effects and hence the relative lack of potential for secondary hematologic malignancies to result from treatment. IRIS, an international study that compared interferon/cytarabine combination and the first of these new drugs imatinib, with long-term follow up, demonstrated the clear superiority of tyrosine-kinase-targeted inhibition over existing treatments.|$|E

What this study addsBecause the primary mechanism of IFN clearance is catabolism in the kidney, appropriate dosing of IFN-based therapies in patients with renal insufficiency is an important issue. This multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study shows that exposure to PEG-IFN alfa- 2 b is increased in patients with renal insufficiency, suggesting that doses of the drug should be reduced by 50 % in patients with severe renal insufficiency and by 25 % in those with moderate insufficiency.

In cell cul-ture, ASV inhibited replication of HCV replicons representing genotypes 1 and 4, with 50 % effective concentrations (EC 50 s) ranging from 1 to 4 nM, and had weaker activity against genotypes 2 and 3 (EC 50, 67 to 1, 162 nM). Selectivity was again demon-strated by the absence of activity (EC 50,> 12 M) against a panel of other RNA viruses. ASV exhibited additive or synergistic activity in combination studies with <b>alfa</b> <b>interferon,</b> ribavirin, and/or inhibitors specifically targeting NS 5 A or NS 5 B.

40|$|Thi s {{article is}} the first in a two-part series. ABSTRACT: Interferons are {{proteins}} with antiviral, antiproliferative, and immune-regulating activity. They are classified as alfa, beta, or gamma on the basis of antigenicity and biologic properties. <b>Alfa</b> <b>interferons</b> as single-agent therapy produce clinical improvement in approximately 90 percent of patients with hairy-cell leukemia, and up to 70 percent of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in early-stage disease. Prolonged suppression or elimination of the leukemic cell clone by interferon may ultimately increase survival of patients with CML. Interferon is not effective single-agent therapy for multiple myeloma, but improves response rate when combined with conventional agents. AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma demonstrates a 40 percent objective response rate to interferon, with less risk of immune system suppression than conventional cytotoxics. Other applications of a 1 fainterferon include malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Beta interferon is similar to the alfa subtype and may have utility in treatment of brain tumors.

THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM has long been recognized as a defense against invasion by infectious organisms.

Genetic engineering techniques have permitted large-scale production of immunologic cell products for use in clinical trials.

50|$|Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KHE) {{is a rare}} {{vascular}} neoplasm that is locally aggressive {{but without}} metastatic potential. It occurs particularly in the skin, deep soft tissue, retroperitoneum, mediastinum, and rarely in bone. Although lesions occur solitary, they often involve {{large areas of the}} body, such as the head/neck region (40%), trunk (30%), or extremity (30%).Usually, it is present at birth as a flat, reddish-purple, tense and edematous lesion.Although half of lesions are congenital, 58% of KHE develop during infancy, 32% between age 1 and 10 years (32%) and 10% after 11 years of age. Moreover, adult onset has been described too with mainly males being affected. Both sexes are affected equally in children.Lesions are often greater than 5 cm in diameter and can cause visible deformity and pain. During early childhood, KHE may enlarge and after 2 years of age, it may partially regress. Though, it usually persists longterm. In addition, 50% of patients suffer from coagulopathy due to thrombocytopenia (<25,000/mm3), presenting with petechiae and bleeding. This is called the Kasabach-Merritt Phenomenon, which is caused by trapping of platelets and other clotting factors within the tumor. Kasabach-Merritt Phenomenon is less likely in patients with lesions less than 8 cm. As two-thirds of adult-onset KHE tumors are less than 2 cm, KHE in adults is rarely associated with Kasabach-Merritt Phenomenon.Patients with KHE and Kasabach-Merritt Phenomenon present with petechiae and ecchymosis.Most KHE tumors are diffuse involving multiple tissue planes and important structures. Resection of KHE is thus often difficult. Treatment of kaposiform hemangioendothelioma is therefore medical. The primary drug is <b>interferon</b> <b>alfa,</b> which is successful in 50% of children. Another option is vincristine, which has lots of side-effects, but has a response rate of 90%. Drug therapy is often used in shrinking the tumor and treating the coagulopathy. However, many of these kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas do not completely regress and remain as a much smaller asymptomatic tumor. However, KHE still has a high mortality rate of 30%. Although complete surgical removal with a large margin has the best reported outcome, it is usually not done because of the risk of bleeding, extensiveness, and the anatomic site of the lesion.Operative management may be possible for small or localized lesions. Removal of larger areas also may be indicated for symptomatic patients or for patients who have failed farmacotherapy. Resection is not required for lesions that are not causing functional problems, because KHE is benign and because resection could cause deformity.|$|E

Histological findings showed collecting duct carcinoma associated with clear cell carcinoma directly invading the liver with lymph node metastasis (pT 4 N 2 M 0). Although he underwent 4 cycles of gemcitabine-cisplatin therapy and <b>alfa</b> <b>interferon</b> injection 3 times a week thereafter as adjuvant setting, multiple liver metastasis occurred 15 months after surgery. He died of cancer 31 months after surgery in spite of molecular targeted therapy including sorafenib and sunitinib...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{clinical}} {{course and the}} effect of <b>alfa</b> <b>interferon</b> treatment in sixty-six patients of Southern Italy suffering from chronic hepatitis C virus. The patients were randomly assigned to the control group (33 patients without treatment) or to the group treated with 3 MU of interferon three times a week for six months. Alanine transaminase (ALT) levels normalized in 17 of the 33 treated subjects (52 %) within two months of treatment. Seven of these "responders" relapsed {{at the end of the}} six-month treatment period, but ALT normalized in these patients after resumption of interferon at the same dosage. None of the non responders on 3 MU for four months showed improvement even when the dose was increased to 6 MU. Our results coincide with other reports on interferon treatment in hepatitis C virus. Further studies are required to clarify whether or not higher doses at the onset of treatment increase the number of responders and decrease the frequency of relapses...|$|R
