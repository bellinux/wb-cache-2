40|$|Bounds on the {{distribution}} function of the sum of two random variables with known marginal distributions obtained by Makarov (1981) {{can be used to}} bound the cumulative distribution function (c. d. f.) of individual treatment effects. Identification of {{the distribution}} of individual treatment effects is important for policy purposes if we are interested in functionals of that distribution, such as the proportion of individuals who gain from the treatment and the expected gain from the treatment for these individuals. Makarov bounds on the c. d. f. of the individual treatment effect distribution are pointwise sharp, i. e. they cannot be improved in any single point of the distribution. We show that the Makarov bounds are not uniformly sharp. Specifically, we show that the Makarov bounds on the region that contains the c. d. f. of the treatment effect <b>distribution</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> (or more) points can be improved, and we derive the smallest set for the c. d. f. of the treatment effect <b>distribution</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> (or more) points.
