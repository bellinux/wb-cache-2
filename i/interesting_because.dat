5|$|Benny Benke, {{writing for}} the Semarang-based daily Suara Merdeka, found that Bramantyo had used ? to portray {{tolerance}} in Indonesia without making the subject seem cliché; however, he considered some scenes, such as Hendra's conversion, overdone. Frans Sartono, reviewing for the historically Catholic daily Kompas, considered the film heavily didactic but ultimately <b>interesting,</b> <b>because</b> its social commentary was much needed, considering Indonesia's religious turmoil. He {{also noted that the}} characters were driven to their actions by worldly needs and not religion.|$|E
5|$|NAD is also {{consumed}} by sirtuins, which are NAD-dependent deacetylases, such as Sir2. These enzymes act by transferring an acetyl group from their substrate protein to the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The sirtuins mainly {{seem to be}} involved in regulating transcription through deacetylating histones and altering nucleosome structure. However, non-histone proteins can be deacetylated by sirtuins as well. These activities of sirtuins are particularly <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> of their importance in the regulation of aging.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Glenn T. Seaborg {{established}} that when thorium was bombarded with neutrons, {{it could be}} transformed into fissile uranium-233. This was another possible route to an atomic bomb, especially if {{it turned out that}} uranium-233 could be more easily separated from thorium than plutonium from uranium. It was not pursued further because uranium-233 production would have required a complete redesign of the Hanford reactors; but in April 1944 the Metallurgical Laboratory's Thorfin R. Rogness calculated that a nuclear reactor containing thorium could produce enough uranium-233 to sustain its reaction without adding anything but more thorium. This was very <b>interesting,</b> <b>because</b> {{at the time it was}} thought that uranium might be scarce, whereas thorium was at least ten times more plentiful.|$|E

5|$|The {{measure and}} weight {{systems for the}} large {{mainland}} part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies were unified in 1840. The area consisted of the southern half of the Italian Peninsula and included Naples and Salerno. The subdivision of apothecaries' weight in the unified system was {{essentially the same as}} that for gold, silver, coins and silk. It was the most excentric variant in that the ounce was divided in 10drachms, rather than the usual8. The scruple, like in Venice but unlike {{in the rest of the}} Romance region, was divided into 20grains. The existence of a unit called aureo, the equivalent of 1½ dramme, is <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> 6 aurei were 9 dramme. In the original Salerno weight system an ounce was divided into 9 drachms, and so an aureo would have been ⅙ of an ounce.|$|E
5|$|Some reviewers {{enjoyed the}} game's story, but many {{pointed out that}} the campaign's {{conclusion}} was anticlimatic due to its abrupt and unresolved ending. Plagge found the plot to be <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> it explored different parts of the Halo universe. She also felt the integration of the narrative with the campaign missions was effectively implemented through the cutscenes and pre-fight dialogue. However, she remarked that characters were underdeveloped and the story did not contribute much to the main Halo arc. Stapleton thought that Isabel was an endearing and emotive character that bolstered the fear induced by the game's antagonist, Atriox. He enjoyed Atriox's strong introduction but felt that the character became less prominent as the story progressed. Eurogamer writer Chris Bratt believed there was potential for an interesting backstory with Atriox and the Banished, but he viewed their motives in the campaign as being too similar to the Covenant, which consequently made the story feel like it was retreading familiar territory. Reactions towards the campaign cutscenes were overwhelmingly positive, with plenty of praise directed towards the high quality production and exceptional animation. While the character dialogue was noted as being cheesy at times, the expressive facial animations kept the cinematics captivating.|$|E

25|$|In a {{beginning}} film course at USC Cinema during 1969, Carpenter {{wrote and directed}} an 8-minute short film, Captain Voyeur.

25|$|This {{is one of}} {{the things}} that really make the race <b>interesting.</b> <b>Because</b> each team only has two bikes and four members, each member must perform at least one {{exchange}} during the course of the race.

25|$|This {{variation}} of the birthday problem is <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> {{there is not a}} unique solution for the total number of people m+n.

25|$|Equidissections do {{not have}} many direct applications. They are {{considered}} <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> the results are counterintuitive at first, and for a geometry problem with such a simple definition, the theory requires some surprisingly sophisticated algebraic tools. Many of the results rely upon extending p-adic valuations to the real numbers and extending Sperner's lemma to more general colored graphs.|$|E
25|$|The {{instrumental}} set-up is <b>interesting,</b> <b>because</b> {{they use}} some of the original instruments of the son: the botija and a unique square bongó. Soon this (and other) groups appreciated that the double bass was a musically more suitable instrument: they never went back to the botija. Five years later, the group had new members and a different look, including Agustín Gutierrez (bongó), Abelardo Barroso (sonero, claves), Felipe Nerí Cabrera (maracas, vocals); Gerardo Martínez (double bass, vocals, leader); Guillermo Castillo (guitar, vocals), Carlos Godínez (tres, vocals).|$|E

25|$|Although tilt {{and swing}} are {{normally}} used {{to maximize the}} part of the image that is within the DOF, they also can be used, in combination with a small f-number, to give selective focus to a plane that isn't perpendicular to the lens axis. With this technique, it is possible to have objects at greatly different distances from the camera in sharp focus and yet have a very shallow DOF. The effect can be <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> it differs from what most viewers are accustomed to seeing.|$|E
25|$|The trifolium villa, {{named after}} a clover-shaped room that was without a doubt used as a triclinium, is the largest private house {{excavated}} so far at Dougga. The house had two storeys, but there is almost nothing left of the upper storey. It stands {{in the south of}} the city, halfway up the hill. The house is particularly <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> {{of the way in which}} it is built to align with the lay of the land; the entrance hall slopes down to a courtyard around which the various rooms were arranged.|$|E
25|$|Chemoreception in {{crocodiles}} {{is especially}} <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> they hunt in both terrestrial and aquatic surroundings. Crocodiles {{have only one}} olfactory chamber and the vomeronasal organ is absent in the adults indicating all olfactory perception {{is limited to the}} olfactory system. Behavioural and olfactometer experiments indicate that crocodiles detect both air-borne and water-soluble chemicals and use their olfactory system for hunting. When above water, crocodiles enhance their ability to detect volatile odorants by gular pumping, a rhythmic movement of the floor of the pharynx. Crocodiles close their nostrils when submerged, so olfaction underwater is unlikely. Underwater food detection is presumably gustatory and tactile.|$|E

The scenes Musicians and Horo are especially <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> they represent the cloths and the way of living of the Bulgarians during the 14th century. There are scenes of Saint Ivan of Rila life. Although there are relatively few preserved monuments of the Tarnovo School of Painting, they refute the popular opinion that the religious murals are inveterate {{and that they are}} inappropriate for artistic imagination.|$|E
25|$|The {{district}} is <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> {{of the large}} number of wood-framed outbuildings still remaining from the district's main period of significance (1855–1930). The {{district is}} also significant for {{the large number of}} mid-19th-century vernacular homes and commercial buildings which remain intact and retain a large amount of their architectural integrity. The buildings contribute {{to the understanding of the}} agricultural, social, and commercial history of late-19th-century and early-20th-century northern Illinois. Together the structures and their lots convey the feeling of a small and active pre-Great Depression farming community. The Scales Mound Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 5, 1990.|$|E
25|$|The first Finnish {{statutory}} regulation for ships navigating in ice was given on 27 March 1890. It was primarily intended {{to increase the}} safety and set a number of requirements for passenger ships operating regularly in winter conditions. These included double bottom in way of the engines and boilers, construction {{according to the rules}} of Lloyd's Register or Bureau Veritas, at least five transverse watertight bulkheads, and sufficient damage stability to survive the flooding of two compartments without sinking. The last requirement is <b>interesting</b> <b>because</b> it {{was not included in the}} latter ice class rules and did not become mandatory again for ships partaking in international traffic until 1960.|$|E
