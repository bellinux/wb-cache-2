5|$|Taylor {{was named}} to the Aussie Belles that was going to the 2012 Summer Paralympics. That the team {{qualified}} for the Games came as a surprise, as the Australian Paralympic Committee had been working on player development with an idea of the team qualifying for the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and an Australian team had not participated since the 2000 Summer Paralympics, when they earned an automatic selection as hosts, and the team finished last in the competition. Going into the Paralympics, her team was ranked eighth in the world. The Australian Paralympic Committee had chosen to work on her development as a goalball player with the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> might be able to qualify for and win a medal at the 2016 Summer Paralympics. Taylor debuted the national team's Paralympic uniform on 1 May 2012 at the Sydney Overseas Passenger Terminal on day two of the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia Spring/Summer 2012/13. In the 2012 Summer Paralympics tournament, the Belles played games against Japan, Canada, the United States and Sweden. They lost every game, and did not advance to the finals.|$|E
25|$|The Piraeus Athena {{is often}} {{mentioned}} to seem approachable by the scholar, Neer. This {{serves as a}} stark contrast from the Archaic style, where gods were often depicted as stern according to Neer One reason Athena here is perceived approachable is due to her stance. The Piraeus Athena, here is in contrapposto stance, meaning that her left leg is more relaxed, while she is putting her weight on the right leg. This position portrays the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is almost stooping towards the mortal viewer. The passive and gentle {{expression on her face}} is also denoted with an air of approachability according.|$|E
25|$|Although Helen {{was never}} tried during the McCarthy era, her works {{suffered}} from the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a Chinese Communist sympathizer. She often had issues getting new books published and many of her books went out of print. Helen returned to China twice more in her lifetime. The first visit was from 1972 to 1973, following President Richard Nixon's trip in 1972 which eased relations between China and the United States. The second visit was in 1978 when Helen returned to China for six weeks with a camera crew. There she was interviewed and asked to recount her adventures of the 1930s with Edgar. Helen {{spent the rest of}} her life in Connecticut, developing an interest in family genealogy, drafting a novel, and writing short pieces on her experiences in China. She published her autobiography in 1984.|$|E

She also supported the Gentlewomen's Employment Club in London, donating a significant sum of money in 1889. In The Women's Gazette and Work and Leisure Hubbard also promoted the idea of Friendly societies for women. In 1889 Hubbard served as the provisional president of a new group known as the Court of the United Sisters' Friendly Society. Several other organizations were formed by readers of Hubbard's publications. She often sought to unify and coordinate philanthropic activities by different women's groups. Many of the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> advanced were dramatically opposed to the prevailing views in society at the time she began her activism, but became commonplace by the end of her life. She also promoted midwifery as a career and argued that better training was needed for women in the field. She also helped establish the Trained Midwives Registration Society with Zepherina Veitch, initially serving as the organising secretary.|$|E

Within youth culture in Japan, she has been adopted as [...] "a rebellion figure {{in much the same}} way as the American and British 1960s 'hippies' did." [...] She has also been a source of inspiration for Japanese fashion, in particular Lolita fashion.

And she's sort of dragging that leg as a trophy and making it back on stage as a fully-realized, complete new person". Jo Ratcliffe, a London-based illustrator known for her hand-drawn graphic design, was hired to provide animation effects for the video. She described Gaga as [...] "really tough" [...] during filming and added that she had [...] "never seen anyone push themselves so hard."

McEntire revealed that she originally wanted to only cover her own hits. However, her husband and manager, Narvel Blackstock wanted her to do a cover song.

500|$|Named after Russian {{composer}} Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Rimsky-Korsakoffee {{was one of}} Portland's first coffeehouses. The classical music-themed business, {{located in}} Portland's Buckman neighborhood, serves coffee and desserts. It operates from the former living room of a reportedly haunted Craftsman-style house, built in 1902 and [...] "nearly hidden from view" [...] by the surrounding foliage. In 2006, The Oregonian Vivian McInerny suggested that writer Louise Bryant once lived in the house. Bryant and her second husband, John Reed, documented parts of the Russian Revolution in works such as her Six Months in Red Russia. However, evidence analyzed by Michael Munk for publication in Oregon Historical Quarterly and elsewhere lends no support {{to the idea that}} Bryant ever lived at 707 Southeast 12th Avenue (Rimsky-Korsakoffee House's street address) and casts strong doubt on the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> met Reed there.|$|E

Kring pitched Bell the idea for the character [...] "which she loved" [...] and soon they were [...] "off and running." [...] The casting of Bell, as Kring explains, [...] "was not easy to pull off," [...] but because of the large ensemble cast of the series and multiple story arcs, [...] "we found a way to jump into a small window in [...] schedule." [...] Originally, Elle was only meant to be Bob's stepdaughter and Meredith Gordon's daughter, making her Claire Bennet's sister, however this idea was dropped due to [...] "lack of storyline and plot holes".|$|E
500|$|In Odd Girl Out, Laura Landon's {{resistance}} to the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> may be homosexual lies in her own concept of femininity rather than any repugnance for loving women. In I Am a Woman, the second book in the series, Beebo's butch appearance [...] "seems to alternately terrify and attract Laura", leading to a very erotic physical relationship. However, when Laura lashes out at Beebo {{in a moment of}} self-pity, it is her masculinity that Laura attacks, invalidating Beebo's uniqueness and the core of her desirability violently. In the book that exhibits the most self-destruction in the series, Women in the Shadows, Laura expresses shame when accompanying Beebo outside of Greenwich Village, fearing Beebo will be arrested and jailed. Facing the end of their relationship, Beebo expresses the desire to be a man, if only to be able to marry Laura to give her a normal life.|$|E

The title of the album came from the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had become a new person after her concert during her 20th birthday, as she wanted to [...] "lead everyone" [...] through her songs.

500|$|Ferrier met Albert Wilson in 1933, {{probably}} through dancing, {{which they}} both loved. When she {{announced that they}} were to marry, her family and friends had strong reservations, on the grounds that she was young and inexperienced, and that she and Wilson shared few serious interests. Nevertheless, the marriage took place on 19 November 1935. Shortly afterwards the couple moved to Silloth, a small port town in Cumberland, where Wilson had been appointed as manager of his bank's branch. The marriage was not successful; the honeymoon had revealed problems of physical incompatibility, and the union remained unconsummated. In a tribute article written for the 50th anniversary of Ferrier's death, the journalist Rupert Christiansen wrote of Ferrier's sexuality that [...] "there is absolutely no justification for the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was a lesbian, but she may have been sexually frigid". Outward appearances were maintained for a few years, until Wilson's departure for military service in 1940 effectively ended the marriage. The couple divorced in 1947, though they remained on good terms. Wilson subsequently married a friend of Ferrier's, Wyn Hetherington; he died in 1969.|$|E

Principal photography for the episode commenced on October 6, 2011, while the fifth episode, [...] "The First Time" [...] was still shooting; It was initially filmed in parallel with that episode, which continued through October 14, 2011, and also with the seventh episode, which began filming on October 13, 2011. This episode marked the 300th musical number Glee has filmed, which was a mash-up of two Adele songs: [...] "Rumour Has It" [...] and [...] "Someone Like You", with lead vocals by Amber Riley and Naya Rivera. The performance was filmed with great fanfare [...] "in {{front of an audience}} of press and crew members" [...] on October 26, 2011, and included a press briefing afterward.

500|$|Apart from Lana, Clark had {{a growing}} {{relationship}} with Lois. Season five saw the melting {{of the ice}} between the two characters, who continued to butt heads. Executive producer Darren Swimmer believed that the audience could finally start to see a growing attraction between the two, {{and the fact that}} both would be there for the other in a time of need. Erica Durance believed that Lois in season five, because of her self-imposed walls, laughed off any notion that she had a romantic interest in Clark, even if that notion was true. In season six, Durance described the relationship between Lois and Clark as something neither character wanted to put an official label on. Instead, Durance believed that, by that point in the series, Clark and Lois were satisfied with identifying with a [...] "brother and sister friendship" [...] label, rather than trying to discover how each truly feels. By season eight, Durance noted that Lois was starting to accept the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> may be in love with Clark more than she had been with anyone else in her life.

500|$|Director Jeunet {{wanted to}} display Ripley's new powers, {{including}} {{a scene in}} which Ripley throws a basketball through a hoop while facing the opposite direction. Weaver trained for ten days and averaged one out of six baskets, although the distance required for filming was farther than she had practiced. Jeunet was concerned about the time being spent on the shot and wanted to either use a machine to throw the ball or to insert it later using computer-generated imagery (CGI). Weaver, however, was determined to make the shot authentic, and insisted on doing it herself. The shot required many dozens of takes, during which none of the balls went in. The crew were going to give up, but gave Weaver one last shot, and in this take, she got the ball in perfectly; the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did it in one take is a myth. The ball was out of frame for a moment during the shot, and Pitof offered to edit it so that the ball was on-screen for the entire scene, but Weaver refused. Ron Perlman broke character when she made the basket, and turned to the camera to say [...] "Oh my god!" [...] There was enough of a pause between Weaver's basket and Perlman's statement for the film's editors to cut the scene accordingly during post-production.|$|E
