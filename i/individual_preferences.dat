5|$|Since the {{development}} staff had {{an equal number}} of writers as illustrators, it was originally planned to pair each illustrator with a single scenario writer; Mistumi was also to provide designs for the main heroine. Though this would have simplified the project's workload by easing communications among the staff, the idea was scrapped once the staff realized that the final product might merely be a collection of four distinct pieces. Ultimately, writing and design responsibilities were divided based on the staff members' <b>individual</b> <b>preferences.</b> The staff also commented that {{the development}} team faced communication difficulties because of the physical distance between the two Aquaplus studios. Early in production, members from both studios gathered in a single location to discuss development, but as production progressed, they began to rely on other methods of communication such as telephone calls and instant messaging. Washimi noted that these methods made it complicated for the writers and illustrators to communicate effectively, and during the development of To Heart 2 X Rated, Miyake took a two-month-long business trip to Osaka to rectify the problem.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The <b>individual</b> <b>preference</b> effect {{supplements}} {{the predominant}} group-level {{explanations for the}} failure of groups to solve hidden profiles. Even in the absence of dysfunctional group-level processes, group members tend to stick to their suboptimal initial decision preferences due to preference-consistent evaluation of information. However, previous experiments demonstrating this effect retained two group-level processes, namely (a) social validation of information supporting the group members’ initial preferences and (b) presentation of the additional information in a discussion format. Therefore, it was unclear whether the <b>individual</b> <b>preference</b> effect depends on the co-occurrence of these group-level processes. Here, we report two experiments demonstrating that the <b>individual</b> <b>preference</b> effect is indeed an individual-level phenomenon. Moreover, by a comparison to real interacting groups, we can show that even when all relevant information is exchanged and when no coordination losses occur, almost half of all groups would fail to solve hidden profiles due to the <b>individual</b> <b>preference</b> effect.

40|$|The {{traditional}} model explaining {{racial discrimination}} has blamed discrimination by institutional {{actors in the}} housing industry and government. The author argues that this model ignores the <b>individual</b> <b>preference</b> {{factors that contribute to}} segregation. The replication of segregation in expanding suburban jurisdictions of metropolitan areas and the traditional legal responses are examined, as well as the implications of African American suburban migration. The author questions the adequacy of the traditional model by looking at the <b>individual</b> <b>preference</b> factors of both whites and African Americans that contribute to the replication of segregation in suburbs. The author notes that there is no method to compare the relative weight of institutional discrimination against <b>individual</b> <b>preference</b> factors, and that law and policy must address this to achieve greater racial integration. Finally, the author examines implications of the <b>individual</b> <b>preference</b> factors. The article calls for legislation to affirmatively attract African Americans to particular suburban regions. The author concludes that out of the primary methods of attack against racial discrimination, the fair share approach, as enumerated in New Jersey 2 ̆ 7 s Mount Laurel decision, is the best for overcoming <b>individual</b> <b>preference</b> factors. Fair share approaches would be more successful if they focused less on low-income housing and more on the construction of apartment units in suburban areas...|$|R
