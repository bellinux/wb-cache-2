This small radius and <b>high</b> <b>weight</b> cause it to be expected to have an extremely high density of around 46g·cm−3, over twice that of osmium, currently the most dense element known, at 22.61g·cm−3; unhexquadium should be the second most dense element in the first 9 periods of the periodic table, with only its neighbour unhextrium (element 163) being more dense (at 47g·cm−3). Metallic unhexquadium should be quite stable, as the 8s and 8p1/2 electrons are very deeply buried in the electron core and only the 7d electrons are available for bonding. Metallic unhexquadium should have a very large cohesive energy due to its covalent bonds, most probably resulting in a high melting point.|$|E

25|$|Most gem-quality diamond {{crystals}} are octahedra {{in their}} rough state (see material properties of diamond). These crystals are usually cut into round brilliants {{because it is}} possible to cut two such stones out of one octahedron with minimal loss of weight. If the crystal is malformed or twinned, or if inclusions are present at inopportune locations, the diamond is more likely to receive a fancy cut (a cut other than a round brilliant). This is especially true in the case of macle, which are flattened twin octahedron crystals. Round brilliants have certain requisite proportions that would result in <b>high</b> <b>weight</b> loss, whereas fancy cuts are typically much more flexible in this regard. Sometimes the cutters compromise and accept lesser proportions and symmetry in order to avoid inclusions or to preserve carat weight, since the per-carat price of diamond is much higher when the stone is over one carat (200 mg).|$|E

2500|$|The first-generation Corvair {{featured}} a rear engine + swing axle design {{similar to that}} of the Renault Dauphine and Volkswagen Beetle [...] a design which eliminates universal joints at the wheels and keeps the rear wheels perpendicular to the half-shafts. The design can allow rear tires to undergo large camber angle changes during fast cornering due to side g-forces causing [...] "rebound" [...] camber and decreasing the tread contact with the road surface, leading to a loss of rear wheel grip and oversteer—a dynamically unstable condition where a driver can lose control and spin. [...] The problem is most severe with rear-engine swing axle combinations because of the greater inertial mass over the rear wheels and the higher center of gravity during rebound camber conditions. [...] The additional <b>high</b> <b>weight</b> of a station wagon body also exacerbates the tendency. [...] Oversteer is exacerbated by deceleration during cornering due to increased side g-force and lightened load on rear tires (lift-off oversteer). Understeer is common in front-engine cars, due to more weight, and inertia, on the front tires. Both conditions are dangerous when a car is driven at its cornering limits.|$|E
