5000|$|Pdof. Dr. von Freytag-Löringhoff, a {{professor}} of philosophy specialized in logic at the University of Tübingen built the first replica of Schickard's machine in 1960 {{but he had to}} improve on the design of the carry mechanism: [...] This simple-looking device actually presents a host of problems to anyone attempting to construct an adding machine based on this principle. The major problem is caused {{by the fact that the}} single tooth must enter into the teeth of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wheel,</b> rotate it 36 degrees (one tenth of a revolution), and exit from the teeth, all while only rotating 36 degrees itself. The most elementary solution to this problem consists of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>wheel</b> being, in effect, two different gears, one with long and one with short teeth together with a spring-loaded detente (much like the pointer used on the big wheel of the gambling game generally known as Crown and Anchor) which would allow the gears to stop only in specific locations. It is not known if Schickard used this mechanism, but it certainly works well on the reproductions constructed by von Freytag Loringhoff. Michael R. Williams ...|$|E
50|$|Initially center seconds {{hands were}} driven off the third wheel, {{sometimes}} via an <b>intermediate</b> <b>wheel,</b> with the gearing {{on the outside}} of the top plate. This method of driving the seconds hand is called indirect center seconds. Because the gearing was outside the plates, it added to the thickness of the movement, and because the rotation of the third wheel had to be geared up to turn the seconds hand once a minute, the seconds hand had a fluttering motion.|$|E
5000|$|Direct-drive {{turntables}} {{drive the}} platter directly without utilizing <b>intermediate</b> <b>wheels,</b> belts, or gears {{as part of}} a drive train. The platter functions as a motor armature. This requires good engineering, with advanced electronics for acceleration and speed control. Matsushita's Technics division introduced the first commercially successful direct drive platter, model SP10, in 1969, which was joined by the Technics SL-1200 turntable, in 1972. Its updated model, SL-1200MK2, released in 1978, had a stronger motor, a convenient pitch control slider for beatmatching and a stylus illuminator, which made it the long-standing favourite among disc jockeys (see [...] "Turntablism"). By the beginnings of the 80s, lowering of costs in microcontroller electronics made direct drive turntables more affordable.|$|R
5000|$|Each of the 'planetary' dials used complex {{clockwork}} {{to produce}} reasonably accurate {{models of the}} planets' motion. These agreed reasonably well both with Ptolemaic theory and with observations. For example, Dondi's dial for Mercury uses a number of <b>intermediate</b> <b>wheels,</b> including: a wheel with 146 teeth, two oval wheels with 24 irregularly shaped teeth that meshed together, a wheel with 63 internal (facing inwards) teeth that meshed with a 20 tooth pinion. The 63-tooth wheel made one rotation a year, non-uniformly because of the oval driving wheels, and made the main indicator wheel rotate through 63/20 × 12 signs of the zodiac each year. This is equivalent to 37 signs and 24°, a good approximation {{to the value of}} 37 signs and 24° 43' 23" [...] required by theory.|$|R
50|$|The General Motors A {{platform}} (commonly called A-body) was a {{rear wheel}} drive automobile platform designation used from at least 1936 until 1958, and again from 1964 to 1981. In 1982, GM introduced a new front wheel drive A platform, and existing <b>intermediate</b> rear <b>wheel</b> drive products were redesignated as G-bodies.|$|R
5000|$|Schickard's machine used clock wheels {{which were}} made {{stronger}} and were therefore heavier, {{to prevent them}} from being damaged by the force of an operator input. Each digit used a display wheel, an input wheel and an <b>intermediate</b> <b>wheel.</b> During a carry transfer all these wheels meshed with the wheels of the digit receiving the carry. The cumulative friction and inertia of all these wheels could [...] "...potentially damage the machine if a carry needed to be propagated through the digits, for example like adding 1 to a number like 9,999".|$|E
5000|$|Bruno von Freytag Loringhoff, a {{mathematics}} {{professor at}} the University of Tübingen built the first replica of Schickard's machine but not without adding wheels and springs to finish the design. This detail is not described in Schickard's two surviving letters and drawings. A problem {{in the operation of}} the Schickard machine, based on the surviving notes, was found after the replicas were built. Schickard's machine used clock wheels which were made stronger and were therefore heavier, to prevent them from being damaged by the force of an operator input. Each digit used a display wheel, an input wheel and an <b>intermediate</b> <b>wheel.</b> During a carry transfer all these wheels meshed with the wheels of the digit receiving the carry. The cumulative friction and inertia of all these wheels could [...] "...potentially damage the machine if a carry needed to be propagated through the digits, for example like adding 1 to a number like 9,999". The great innovation in Pascal's calculator was that it was designed so that each input wheel is totally independent from all the others and carries are propagated in sequence. Pascal chose, for his machine, a method of re-zeroing that propagates a carry right through the machine. It is the most demanding operation to execute for a mechanical calculator and proved, before each operation, that the carry mechanism of the Pascaline was fully functional. This could be taken as a testament {{to the quality of the}} Pascaline because none of the 18th century criticisms of the machine mentioned a problem with the carry mechanism and yet this feature was fully tested on all the machines, by their resets, all the time.|$|E
5000|$|Articulated {{locomotives}} such as Garratts, {{which are}} effectively two locomotives {{joined by a}} common boiler, have a + between the arrangements of each engine. Thus a [...] "double Pacific" [...] type Garratt is a 4-6-2+2-6-4. For Garratt locomotives the + sign is used even {{when there are no}} <b>intermediate</b> unpowered <b>wheels,</b> e.g. the LMS Garratt 2-6-0+0-6-2. This is because the two engine units are more than just power bogies. They are complete engines, carrying fuel and water tanks. The + sign represents the bridge (carrying the boiler) that links the two engines.|$|R
50|$|When introduced, these engines {{were up to}} {{date with}} {{contemporary}} locomotive practice. They were superheated, with Belpaire fireboxes. The cylinders were arranged outside the plate frames, with the 10 in diameter outside admission piston valves arranged above the cylinders and actuated by Walschaerts valve gear. The drivers and <b>intermediate</b> coupled <b>wheels</b> were flangeless. The motion, axleboxes and several other details were identical or similar to equivalent parts of the Class 10, which was built {{at the same time}} by the same manufacturer, and their Type XM2 two-axle bogie tenders were identical.|$|R
5000|$|During 1944 Dr. M.M. Loubser, then CME, who {{had been}} {{involved}} with the design of the Class 19 family from the very beginning in the late 1920s, made further improvements to the Class 19D. All the post-war locomotives came equipped with vacuum brake systems in addition to the steam brakes. The two 21 in vacuum cylinders were fitted under the running boards on either side at a point about midway between the leading and driving coupled wheels, while the vacuum chamber was arranged in line with the <b>intermediate</b> coupled <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{enable them}} to {{negotiate}} 300 ft radius curves, the leading coupled wheels were given a 1 in total side-play in their horn blocks, while the tyre flanges of the <b>intermediate</b> coupled <b>wheels</b> were of reduced thickness and the leading coupling rods were provided with spherical bearings at the knuckle joints and crank pins. In addition, largely also {{as a result of}} the decision to use the shorter Watson Standard boiler, it was decided to reduce the coupled wheel diameter from the originally intended 66 in to 63 in, which shortened the coupled wheelbase and would further ease passage on sharp curves.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the kinetic {{characteristic}} of a new continuously-variable-transmission (CVT), a three-dimensional model of the CVT was first established by Pro/E solid design and it was saved as Parasolid file format. Then, a kinematics simulation model of drive system of the CVT was established by importing the Parasolid file into ADAMS and the simulation was realized by replacing the traction drive of elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) oil film with the contact constraint joints between the input and output wheel discs and the <b>intermediate</b> idler <b>wheels.</b> The simulation results demonstrate that the three-dimensional simulation model of the CVT is accurate, and the equivalent drive system of the CVT is reasonable...|$|R
5000|$|The Class 20 2-10-2 Santa Fe type steam {{locomotive}} was designed in 1934 by A.G. Watson, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the South African Railways (SAR) from 1929 to 1936, and {{was built by}} the SAR at its Pretoria Mechanical Shops at Salvokop. The locomotive was intended for use on the South West Africa system, where the tracks consisted of [...] section rail laid in desert conditions and practically without ballast. This restricted Watson to a maximum axle load of 11 lt t and he decided upon a Santa Fe type wheel arrangement with 48 in diameter coupled wheels and flangeless driving and <b>intermediate</b> coupled <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|This stone {{bridge is}} the only known example of a Classical period bridge in Greece. It uses the {{standard}} post and lintel construction of its time, rather than arches as later bridges do. It measured c. 9 m wide with a span of c. 8 m that consisted of four rows of lintel blocks resting on five rows of posts (the two end points and three <b>intermediate</b> supports). <b>Wheel</b> ruts are cut into the stones of the bridge at an oblique angle toward a simple entrance {{on the west side}} of the stoa; these cuttings do not go toward the elaborate propylon (monumental entranceway) of the structure north of the stoa as might seem more likely.|$|R
50|$|Beatty {{believed}} that, {{while the}} earlier 8th Class locomotives (later the SAR Class 8) steamed well, they would steam even {{better if they}} had a larger firegrate area. He was hampered {{by the fact that the}} firebox wrapper plates had to fit between the rearmost coupled wheels. The result was that the greatest inside width obtainable on a firebox which was arranged between the wheels of a Cape gauge locomotive was 27+1/2 in. He overcame this by designing an 8th Class locomotive with a deep curve in the foundation ring (mud ring) to clear the <b>intermediate</b> coupled <b>wheels</b> and a steep slope towards the rear to clear the trailing wheels. In the process he was able to increase the firegrate area from 21 to 27.5 sq ft.|$|R
50|$|The bar {{frames of}} the rear engine unit and its {{high-pressure}} cylinders were rigidly attached to the boiler with the engine’s wide firebox extending over the coupled wheels. The front engine unit and its low-pressure cylinders were not rigidly attached to the boiler barrel, but carried the boiler on a single sliding bearing which was placed between the leading and <b>intermediate</b> coupled <b>wheels.</b> The underside of the smokebox was flattened to provide clearance {{between it and the}} cylinder assemblies of the front engine unit. The two engine units were coupled together by a single vertical pin connection, arranged at a point on the centre-line of the high-pressure cylinder saddle casting. This arrangement gave the locomotive a short rigid wheelbase of 8 ft which made it capable of traversing curves of short radius.|$|R
5000|$|The oldest uses of {{the term}} {{jackshaft}} appear to involve shafts that were <b>intermediate</b> between water <b>wheels</b> or stationary steam engines and the line shafts of 19th century mills. [...] In these early sources from New England mills in 1872 and 1880, the term [...] "jack shaft" [...] always appears in quotes. Another 1872 author wrote [...] "Gear wheels are used in England to transmit {{the power of the}} engine to what is usually called the jack shaft."By 1892, the quotes were gone, but the use remained the same.|$|R
