50|$|The {{developed}} <b>glass</b> <b>master</b> {{is placed}} in a vapour deposition metaliser which uses a combination of mechanical vacuum pumps and cryopumps to lower the total vapour pressure inside a chamber to a hard vacuum. A piece of nickel wire is then heated in a tungsten boat to white hot temperature and the nickel vapour deposited onto the rotating <b>glass</b> <b>master.</b> The <b>glass</b> <b>master</b> is coated with the nickel vapour up to a typical thickness of around 400 nm.|$|E

50|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>mastering</b> is {{performed}} in a class 100 (ISO 5) or better clean room or a self-enclosed clean environment within the mastering system.

50|$|Among the art {{projects}} {{promoted by the}} Valmont Foundation, the most notable is the exhibition “The Dialogue of Fire. Ceramic and <b>Glass</b> <b>Masters</b> from Barcelona to Venice”, which was an official collateral event at the 56th Biennale di Venezia in 2015. The exhibition, curated by Didier Guillon himself along with Luca Berta and Francesca Giubilei, featured contemporary ceramic and glass artworks fabricated at the Artigas Foundation in Gallifa (Catalonia) and on Murano (Italy). The sixteenth-century Palazzo Tiepolo Passi housed, for seven months, a collection of ceramic plates by acclaimed masters such as Antoni Tapies and Eduardo Chillida and site-specific installations created by Silvano Rubino, Judi Harvest, Joan Gardy Artigas, and Isao Llorens Ishikawa. A new project to be presented in Venice in 2017 is now in progress. Didier Guillon has developed a particular fascination for Murano glass and for the tradition of glassmaking in Venice. For this reason, he has produced and designed glass artworks in collaboration with Venetian <b>glass</b> <b>masters,</b> namely the “Cage de Pluie”, a minimalistic sculpture {{in the shape of}} a cube made of ultramarine glass bars.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, Guffogg was {{approached}} by a Venetian art dealer that was looking to have a California artist collaborate with a Murano glass master.  He then pursued this opportunity and went to Venice.  There, he learned the history of Murano glassmaking.  He collaborated with the <b>glass</b> <b>master</b> to display this negative space found with in his oil paintings in a three- dimensional sculpture form.  Guffogg and the <b>glass</b> <b>master</b> proceeded with this, and “The Fifth Sound” Murano glass series came to fruition.  Guffogg sees these pieces as extensions of his two-dimensional work. These pieces are hand blown and then sanded down so they appear more opaque.  Some pieces in the series are also mirror coated as well.|$|E

50|$|In 1990, WEA Manufacturing was sued by a Canadian firm, Optical Recording Co. (ORC), {{for alleged}} {{infringement}} of two 1971 patents related to <b>glass</b> <b>mastering</b> equipment {{which was used}} by Time Warner and WEA Manufacturing {{in the manufacture of}} approximately 450 million CDs. ORC contended that unlike five other major CD manufacturers in the U.S., Time Warner had refused to license the technology from ORC. In 1992, a jury assessed damages of 6 cents per disc, plus $4-5 million in interest.|$|R
50|$|The {{roots of}} the very few <b>glass</b> <b>masters</b> who still {{practise}} this age-old tradition goes back to the Arab artisans, who have settled in Izmir and its towns during the decline of the Ottoman Empire by the end of 19th century. The glass art that has lost its glamour in Anatolia, combining with the eye sign, was relived. The masters who practised their arts at Araphan and Kemeraltı, districts of İzmir, were exiled due to the smoke emissions from their furnaces and fire risks to the neighbourhood.|$|R

5000|$|Electroforming {{occurs in}} [...] "Matrix", the name {{used for the}} {{electroforming}} process area in many plants; {{it is also a}} class 100 (ISO 5) or better clean room. The data (music, computer data, etc.) on the metalised <b>glass</b> <b>master</b> is extremely easy to damage and must be transferred to a tougher form for use in the injection moulding equipment which actually produces the end-product optical disks.|$|E
50|$|The {{system works}} by {{applying}} a bogus data track onto the disc during <b>glass</b> <b>master</b> manufacturing. Since computers {{are designed to}} read data before music, this prevents playback on a PC and thereby prevents ripping as well as ordinary listening using a computer. CD players ignore any non-audio tracks on a disc, and can therefore play the CD unimpeded - Enhanced CDs also {{take advantage of this}} factor.|$|E

European Glass Experience team panel, made of museum directors, curators, and glass experts, selected nearly 80 sketches and artworks, coming from young artists of different cultures. Murano <b>Glass</b> <b>masters</b> associated with Promovetro are going to realize a selection of the most peculiar sketches in glass.|$|R
