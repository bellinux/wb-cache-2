5|$|Henry is {{best known}} for his six marriages and, in particular, his efforts to have his first marriage, to Catherine of Aragon, annulled.

Despite his resulting excommunication, Henry remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings.|$|E
5|$|The General Assembly is {{empowered}} {{to regulate the}} state's judiciary system by setting {{the size of the}} courts and the bounds of their districts.

5|$|The IgG {{antibodies}} form {{a complex}} with heparin and PF4 in the bloodstream. The {{tail of the}} antibody then binds to the FcγIIa receptor, a protein {{on the surface of}} the platelet.

5|$|The tau {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} tau protein abnormalities <b>initiate</b> <b>the</b> disease cascade. In this model, hyperphosphorylated tau begins to pair with other threads of tau. Eventually, they form neurofibrillary tangles inside nerve cell bodies. When this occurs, the microtubules disintegrate, destroying {{the structure of}} the cell's cytoskeleton which collapses the neuron's transport system. This may result first in malfunctions in biochemical communication between neurons and later in the death of the cells.|$|E

30|$|SDTC- 1 {{is applied}} to TNFD {{communication}} where AP <b>initiates</b> <b>the</b> transmission to a HDN. Similarly, SDTC- 2 is applied {{in the case of}} TNFD where AP <b>initiates</b> <b>the</b> transmission to an FDN. Thus, after <b>initiating</b> <b>the</b> transmission by the AP to a FDN, if an ST wants to send data to the AP, the ST needs to satisfy SDTC- 2, i.e., if the ST has data to send to AP and satisfies SDTC- 2, it stops its NAV and starts the self-timer, and the corresponding procedures occur for the TNFD communication, as described in the previous section. In addition, SDTC- 3 is used in the case where an HDN/FDN <b>initiates</b> <b>the</b> TNFD communication. These FD-MAC mechanisms prevent inter-user interference during TNFD communications.|$|R

5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to <b>initiate</b> <b>the</b> lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{unpredictable}} weather, aircraft continued {{to arrive at}} Nadzab sporadically. Only the 2/25th Infantry Battalion {{and part of the}} 2/33rd had reached Nadzab by the morning of 8 September when Vasey ordered the commander of the 25th Infantry Brigade, Brigadier Ken Eather, to <b>initiate</b> <b>the</b> advance on Lae. That day there were 112 landings at Nadzab. On 9 September, as the advance began, the rest of the 2/33rd Infantry Battalion reached Nadzab from Tsili Tsili, but while there were 116 landings at Nadzab, bad weather prevented the 2/31st Infantry Battalion from leaving Port Moresby. Finally, on 12 September, after three non-flying days, the 2/31st Infantry Battalion reached Nadzab on some of the 130 landings on the two strips at Nadzab that day.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the trial, {{questions}} were raised about the fairness and legality of the court-martial proceedings. Owing to public pressure, the United States Navy reconvened the courts-martial board in 1945; the court affirmed the guilt of the convicted men. Widespread publicity surrounding the case {{turned it into a}} cause célèbre among certain Americans; it and other race-related Navy protests of 1944–45 led the Navy to change its practices and <b>initiate</b> <b>the</b> desegregation of its forces beginning in February 1946. In 1994, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial was dedicated to the lives lost in the disaster.|$|E

5|$|During its review, Sandia {{determined}} that a significant overram of the powder bags into the gun had occurred as it was being loaded and that the overram could have caused the explosion. A subsequent test by the Navy of the overram scenario confirmed that an overram could have caused {{an explosion in the}} gun breech. Sandia's technicians also found that the physical evidence did not support the U.S. Navy's theory that an electronic or chemical detonator had been used to <b>initiate</b> <b>the</b> explosion.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Kenneth Lay merged {{the natural}} gas {{pipeline}} companies of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth to form Enron. In the early 1990s, he helped to <b>initiate</b> <b>the</b> selling of electricity at market prices, and soon after, the United States Congress approved legislation deregulating the sale of natural gas. The resulting markets {{made it possible for}} traders such as Enron to sell energy at higher prices, thereby significantly increasing its revenue. After producers and local governments decried the resultant price volatility and asked for increased regulation, strong lobbying on the part of Enron and others prevented such regulation.|$|E
5|$|Independence, however, did <b>initiate</b> <b>the</b> {{abolition}} {{of slavery in}} Spanish America, as it was {{seen as part of}} the independence struggle, since many slaves had gained their manumission by joining the patriot armies. In areas where slavery was not a major source of labor (Mexico, Central America, Chile), emancipation occurred almost immediately after independence was achieved. In areas where slavery was a main labor source (Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina), emancipation was carried out in steps over the next three decades, usually first with the creation of free-womb laws and programs for compensated emancipation. By the early 1850s, slavery had been abolished in the independent nations of Spanish America.|$|E

5|$|NIST {{found that}} the {{fireproofing}} on the Twin Towers' steel infrastructures was blown off by the initial impact of the planes and that, had this not occurred, the towers likely would have remained standing. A 2007 study of the north tower's collapse published by researchers of Purdue University determined that, since the plane's impact had stripped off much of the structure's thermal insulation, the heat from a typical office fire would have softened and weakened the exposed girders and columns enough to <b>initiate</b> <b>the</b> collapse regardless {{of the number of}} columns cut or damaged by the impact.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 1942, {{as part of}} the Manhattan Project, {{another team}} led by Enrico Fermi was able to <b>initiate</b> <b>the</b> first {{artificial}} self-sustained nuclear chain reaction, Chicago Pile-1. An initial plan using enriched uranium-235 was abandoned as it was as yet unavailable in sufficient quantities. Working in a lab below the stands of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400short tons (360metric tons) of graphite, 58short tons (53metric tons) of uranium oxide, and six short tons (5.5 metric tons) of uranium metal, a majority of which was supplied by Westinghouse Lamp Plant in a makeshift production process.|$|E
