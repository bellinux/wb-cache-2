The MA/MyJ mouse deletes the identical set of TCR from its mature T cell repertoire; however, it does not contain Mtv- 7, the murine mammary tumor provirus (MMTV), whose sag gene encodes Mls- 1. Interestingly, the superantigen activity of this mouse strain segregates with a new mammary tumor provirus, Mtv- 43, not seen in other inbred strains. The predicted amino acid sequence of the sag gene of Mtv- 43 was {{compared with that of}} Mtv- 7. Strikingly, the COOH terminus of the two molecules is very similar, while all other MMTV-encoded superantigens differ 100 % in this segment...|$|E
40|$|Superantigens {{are defined}} by their ability to stimulate T cells based {{predominantly}} on their V beta expression and ability to delete T cells in the thymus when expressed endogenously.

We show that Mtv- 8 controls a superantigen with similar specificity, and that both Mtv- 8 and Mtv- 9 stimulate some V beta 17 + T cells. A third provirus, Mtv- 6, controls a superantigen with specificity for V beta 3. Data presented raise the possibility that endogenous superantigens may compete for class II molecules in a single B cell...|$|E

In particular, the importance of the death receptor subgroup of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -family {{has been the subject of}} many investigations, with equivocal results. A recent report suggested that TRAIL was a critical factor in this process, a result that does not fit well with previous studies that excluded a role for the FADD-caspase 8 pathway, which is essential for TRAIL and Fas ligand (FasL) signaling, in negative selection. We have investigated intrathymic negative selection of TRAIL-deficient thymocytes, using four well-established models, including antibody-mediated TCR/CD 3 ligation in vitro, stimulation with <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigen</b> in vitro and in vivo, and treatment with exogenous superantigen in vitro. We were unable to demonstrate a role for TRAIL signaling in any of these models, suggesting that this pathway is not a critical factor for thymocyte negative selection.

40|$|Murine mammary tumor viruses (MMTVs) are retroviruses that encode superantigens {{capable of}} {{stimulating}} T cells via superantigen-reactive T cell receptor V beta chains.

No MMTV proviruses could be detected in the spleen and mammary tissue of these mice, and no deletion of MMTV superantigen- reactive T cells occurred. By contrast, T cell deletion and positive selection due to <b>endogenous</b> MMTV <b>superantigens</b> occurred in B cell- deficient mice.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} {{that at least some}} V beta 17 + T cells interact with an <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigen</b> encoded by the murine retrovirus, Mtv- 9. To analyze the role of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules in presenting the Mtv- 9 encoded superantigen, vSAG- 9 to V beta 17 + hybridomas, a panel of nine hybridomas was tested for their ability to respond to A 20 / 2 J (H- 2 d) and LBK (H- 2 a) cells which had been transfected with the vSAG- 9 gene. Whereas some of the hybridomas recognized vSAG- 9 exclusively in the context of H- 2 a, other hybridomas recognized vSAG- 9 exclusively in the context of H- 2 d or in the context of both H- 2 d and H- 2 a. These results suggest that: (a) the class II MHC molecule plays a direct role in the recognition of retroviral superantigen by T cells, rather than serving simply as a platform for presentation; and, (b) it is likely that components of the TCR other than V beta are involved in the vSAG- 9 /TCR/class II interaction...|$|E
40|$|A {{dominant}} gene carried in certain inbred mouse strains confers susceptibility to tumors induced by polyoma virus. This gene, designated Pyv s, was defined in crosses between the highly susceptible C 3 H/BiDa strain and the highly resistant but H- 2 k-identical C 57 BR/cdJ strain. The resistance of C 57 BR/cdJ mice is overcome by irradiation, indicating an immunological basis. In F 1 x C 57 BR/cdJ backcross mice, tumor susceptibility cosegregates with Mtv- 7, a mouse mammary tumor provirus {{carried by the}} C 3 H/BiDa strain. This suggests that Pyv s might encode the Mtv- 7 superantigen (SAG) and abrogate polyoma tumor immunosurveillance through elimination of T cells bearing specific VB domains. DNA typing of 110 backcross mice showed no evidence of recombination between Pyv s and Mtv- 7. Strongly biased usage of VB 6 by polyoma virus-specific CD 8 § cytotoxic T lymphocytes in C 57 BR/cdJ mice implicates T cells bearing this Mtv- 7 SAG-reactive VB domain as critical anti-polyoma tumor effector cells in vivo. These results indicate identity between Pyv s and Mtv- 7 sag, and demonstrate a novel mechanism of inherited susceptibility to virus-induced tumors based on effects of an <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigen</b> on the host's T cell repertoire. ...|$|E
40|$|Several murine superantigens in {{association}} with class II major histocompatibility complex proteins {{have been shown to}} cause the deletion of T cells based on the expression of particular beta-chain variable region (V beta) gene segments. We have previously shown that mice expressing the Etc- 1 superantigen, encoded by an open reading frame within the 3 ' long terminal repeat of the endogenous mouse mammary tumor provirus (Mtv), Mtv- 9, delete T cells expressing either V beta 5 or V beta 11 gene segments. Comparison of several Mtv 3 ' long terminal repeat open reading frame sequences has indicated that the carboxyl terminus likely encodes the V beta specificity of these proteins. Our analysis of C 57 BL/ 6 x DBA/ 2 recombinant inbred strains of mouse revealed three Mtv- 9 -negative strains that nevertheless have a low frequency of V beta 5 -expressing T cells. Here we demonstrate that a second <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigen,</b> responsible for the deletion of V beta 5 -bearing T cells, is encoded by a gene mapping to Mtv- 6 on chromosome 16. Surprisingly, the carboxyl-terminal sequences of the Mtv- 6 and - 9 superantigens are extremely divergent, {{in spite of the fact}} that they both mediate the deletion of V beta 5 + lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|The role of superantigens in {{infectious}} diseases Exogenous antigens are presented to T lymphocytes through a mechanism that ensures a high recognition specificity. On the other hand, recently described superantigens are particles {{that do not}} follow the processing or presentation route and do not bind to a specific region of T lymphocyte receptors, as conventional antigens. These particles bind to {{a large number of}} T lymphocytes, generating a disproportionate and unspecific immune response. Two types of superantigens have been described. <b>Endogenous</b> <b>superantigens,</b> that are transported in the host genoma, and that are involved in clonal depletion and immunological tolerance phenomena. Exogenous superantigens, mostly bacterial toxins, are involved in several diseases.

40|$|Fas is a 45 -kDa {{membrane}} protein that transduces an apoptotic signal. The mouse lymphoproliferation (lpr) mutation is a leaky mutation of Fas. In this study, we examined lymphocyte development in Fas-null mice generated by gene targeting.

In addition, the Fas-null mice showed lymphocytosis, accompanied by lymphocytic infiltration in the lungs and liver. The number of apparently normal B cells also increased, and large amounts of immunoglobulins, including anti-DNA antibodies, were produced. Thymic clonal deletion, assessed by deletion of T cells reactive to mouse <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigens,</b> was apparently normal in the Fas-/- mice, whereas the peripheral clonal deletion of mature T cells against a bacterial superantigen was impaired.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{here the}} presence of a distinct mature CD 4 + 8 - T cell subset in mouse thymus. This subset, termed "Thy 0," is delineated by the absence of 3 G 11 expression from about half of the 6 C 10 -/HSAlow/- fraction of CD 4 + 8 - thymic cells. Thy 0 is detectable from the neonatal period and largely contributes the Th 0 -type diverse cytokine production previously reported for the HSAlow/-CD 4 + thymic population. Further, cells expressing the T cell receptor V beta 8 gene family are found at increasing frequency in Thy 0 with age, comprising 40 - 60 % of Thy 0 in adult BALB/c mice. This alteration of V beta 8 + cell frequency is unique to Thy 0, since no other CD 4 + subset in thymus or spleen shows such V beta 8 overusage. All functional CD 4 + T cell subsets, including Thy 0, show appropriate V beta clonal deletion associated with <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigens.</b> Thus, it appears that Thy 0 is an intrathymically generated secondary cell subset produced after CD 4 + T cell selection...|$|R
40|$|Germ-line {{retroviral}} insertions in vertebrate genomes are {{implicated in}} the modulation of host immune responses. We demonstrate that CBA/J mice, which carry the proviral integrants mammary tumor virus locus 6 (Mtv 6) and mammary tumor virus locus 7 (Mtv 7), are less resistant to infection with the protozoan pathogen Leishmania major compared with closely related but Mtv 6 -negative and Mtv 7 -negative CBA/CaJ mice. Although both strains generated comparable L. major–specific CD 4 T cell frequencies, T cells from CBA/J mice made much less interferon g (IFN-g). L. major–infected CBA/CaJ dendritic cells primed L. major–specific and allospecific IFN-g–producing CD 4 T cells better in vivo and in vitro, respectively, than CBA/J dendritic cells did. L. major susceptibility appeared {{to be associated with}} Mtv 7, and v-Sag- 7 superantigen expression and L. major infection together reduced the ability of an antigen-presenting cell line to prime alloresponder CD 4 T cells for IFN-g commitment.

40|$|Polyomavirus induces a {{broad array}} of tumors when {{introduced}} into newborn mice of certain standard inbred strains, notably those bearing the H- 2 k haplotype. Susceptibility in these mice is conferred by an endogenous mouse mammary tumor virus superantigen (Mtv- 7 sag) that acts to delete T cells required for polyomavirus-induced tumor immunosurveillance. In the present study we show that mice of two wild-derived inbred strains, PERA/Ei (PE) and CZECH II/Ei (CZ), are highly susceptible to polyomavirus but carry no detectable Mtv sag-related sequences and show no evidence of Vβ deletion. C 57 BR/cdJ (BR) mice, which are H- 2 k but lack the endogenous Mtv- 7, are highly resistant based on an effective anti-polyomavirus tumor immune response. When crossed with BR, both PE and CZ mice transmit their susceptibility in a dominant fashion, indicating a mechanism(s) that overrides the immune response of BR. Susceptibility in PE and CZ mice is not based on interference with antigen processing or presentation since cytotoxic T cells from BR can efficiently kill F 1 -derived tumor cells in vitro. The expected precursors of polyomavirus-specific cytotoxic T cells are present in both the wild inbred animals and their F 1 progeny. These findings indicate a novel basis of susceptibility that operates independently of <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigen</b> and prevents the development of tumor immunity...|$|E
40|$|Transfer of vSAG 7, the <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigen</b> {{encoded in}} the Mtv 7 locus, from MHC class II � to MHC class II � cells has been {{suggested}} to occur both in vivo and in vitro. This transfer usually leads to the activation and deletion of T cells expressing responsive V�s. However, {{there is no direct}} molecular evidence for such a transfer. We have developed an in vitro system which confirms this property of vSAGs. vSAG 7 was transfected into a class II � murine fibroblastic line. Coculture of these cells with class II � cells and murine T cell hybridomas expressing the specific V�s led to high levels of IL- 2 production which was specifically inhibited by vSAG 7 - and MHC class II–specific mAbs. Moreover, injection of vSAG 7 � class II � cells in mice led to expansion of V� 6 � CD 4 � cells. We show that this transfer activity is paracrine but does not require cell-to-cell contact. Indeed, vSAG 7 was transferred across semi-permeable membranes. Transfer can occur both from class II � and class II � cells, indicating that MHC class II does not sequester vSAG 7.

The distribution of mouse mammary tumour viruses (MMTV), which encode <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigens</b> (SAg) such as minor leucocyte-stimulating antigens (Mls) known to modulate the available TcR-V beta repertoire, was investigated in the two lines. Mls- 1 is present in HI-susceptible mice, while Mls- 2 and Mls- 2 -like SAg are absent in both lines. This suggests that Mls antigens play no {{significant role in the}} resistance to CIA. Moreover, HI and HII exhibit close V beta gene usage as assessed by fluorescence staining with 11 V beta-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb). These results indicate that mechanisms other than clonal deletion based on V beta expression and induced by SAg are involved in the resistance of H- 2 q-positive mice to experimental arthritis. Yet, a slightly reduced level of V beta 5 + T cells is observed in HII animals which might correlate with the presence of Mtv- 6 and Mtv- 9 proviruses...|$|R

Here we show that a pancreatic beta cell–reactive, I-Ag 7 –restricted, transgenic TCR that is highly diabetogenic in nonobese diabetic mice (H- 2 g 7) undergoes thymocyte negative selection in diabetes-resistant H- 2 g 7 /b, H- 2 g 7 /k, H- 2 g 7 /q, and H- 2 g 7 /nb 1 NOD mice by engaging antidiabetogenic MHC class II molecules on thymic bone marrow–derived cells, independently of <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigens.</b> Thymocyte deletion is complete in the presence of I-Ab, I-Ak + I-Ek or I-Anb 1 + I-Enb 1 molecules, partial in the presence of I-Aq or I-Ak molecules alone, and absent in the presence of I-As molecules. Mice that delete the transgenic TCR develop variable degrees of insulitis that correlate with the extent of thymocyte deletion, but are invariably resistant to diabetes development. These results provide an explanation as to how protective MHC class II genes carried on one haplotype can override the genetic susceptibility to an autoimmune disease provided by allelic MHC class II genes carried on a second haplotype...|$|R
40|$|T cell {{tolerance}} to self Ags {{is in part}} established in the thymus by induction of apoptosis or anergy of potentially autoreactive thymocytes. Some autospecific T cells nevertheless migrate to peripheral lymphoid organs but are kept under control by the recently identified CD 4 � CD 25 � regulatory T cell subset. Because these cells inhibit autoimmunity more efficiently than useful non-self Ag-specific immune responses, they are probably autospecific, posing important questions {{as to how they}} develop in the thymus. In this study we show that significantly more peripheral CD 4 � CD 25 � regulatory T cells recognize self than non-self Ags. However, we also show for a large panel of <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigens</b> as well as for self peptide/MHC complexes that autospecific CD 4 � CD 25 � thymocyte precursors are normally deleted during ontogeny. Combined, our data firmly establish that the repertoire of regulatory T cells is specifically enriched in autospecific cells despite the fact that their precursors are normally susceptible to thymic deletion. The Journal of Immunology, 2002, 168 : 1644 – 1648. Tolerance of T lymphocytes to self MHC-peptide ligands was thought to be mainly established by thymic deletion of developing autospecific T cells (1).

Here, we report a higher frequency of phosphorylated STAT- 5 (pSTAT- 5) in nTreg cells in the adult murine thymus {{and to a lesser}} extent in the periphery, compared to other CD 4 (+) CD 8 (-) subsets. In the neonatal thymus, the numbers of pSTAT- 5 (+) cells in CD 25 (+) foxp 3 (-) and nTreg cells increased in parallel, suggesting that pSTAT- 5 (+) CD 25 (+) foxp 3 (-) cells might represent the precursors of foxp 3 (+) regulatory T cells. This "specific" pSTAT- 5 expression detected in nTreg cells ex vivo was likely due to a very recent signal given by IL- 2 /IL- 15 cytokines in vivo since (i) it disappeared rapidly if cells were left unstimulated in vitro and (ii) was also observed if total thymocytes were stimulated in vitro with saturating amounts of IL- 2 and/or IL- 15 but not IL- 7. Interestingly, STAT- 5 activation upon IL- 2 stimulation correlated better with foxp 3 and CD 122 than with CD 25 expression. Finally, we show that expression of an <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigen</b> strongly affected the early Treg cell repertoire but not the proportion of pSTAT- 5 (+) cells within this repertoire.

Because the superantigen is known to promote Th 1 cell differentiation in vitro, we have investigated the effect of SEB treatment on the course of Th 2 -associated progressive disease in mice infected systemically with Candida albicans. On {{the basis of the}} kinetics of SEB-induced changes in CD 4 + cells and production in sera of interleukin 4 (IL- 4), IL- 10, and gamma interferon, we obtained evidence that V beta 8 + cell anergy concomitant with infection abolished the early IL- 4 /IL- 10 response of the host to the yeast, ultimately leading to a state of resistance characterized by gamma interferon secretion in vitro by antigen-specific CD 4 + cells. In contrast, SEB administered near the time of challenge resulted in accelerated mortality. Significant resistance to infection was also afforded by exposure of mice to a retrovirally encoded <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigen.</b> These data suggest that CD 4 + V beta 8 + T cells {{play an important role in}} vivo in the initiation of a Th 2 response to C. albicans and that suppression of their activity may alter the qualitative development of the T-cell response and the outcome of infection...|$|E
40|$|Superantigens {{are defined}} by their ability to stimulate a large {{fraction}} of T cells via interaction with the T cell receptor (TCR) V beta domain. Endogenous superantigens, classically termed minor lymphocyte-stimulating (Mls) antigens, were recently identified as products of open reading frames (ORF) in integrated proviral copies of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). We have described an infectious MMTV homologue of the classical <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigen</b> Mls- 1 a (Mtv- 7). The ORF molecules of both the endogenous Mtv- 7 and the infectious MMTV(SW) interact with T cells expressing the TCR V beta 6, 7, 8. 1, and 9 domains. Furthermore, the COOH termini of their ORF molecules, thought to confer TCR specificity, are very similar. Since successful transport of MMTV {{from the site of}} infection in the gut to the mammary gland depends on a functional immune system, we were interested in determining the early events after and requirements for MMTV infection. We show that MMTV(SW) infection induces a massive response of V beta 6 + CDC 4 + T cells, which interact with the viral ORF. Concomitantly, we observed a B cell response and differentiation that depends on both the presence and stimulation of the superantigen-reactive T cells. Furthermore, we show that B cells are the main target of the initial MMTV infection as judged by the presence of the reverse-transcribed viral genome and ORF transcripts. Thus, we suggest that MMTV infection of B cells leads to ORF-mediated B-T cell interaction, which maintains and possibly amplifies viral infection...|$|E

In human IM, {{the majority of}} T cells in the peripheral blood are monoclonal or oligoclonal and are frequently specific for lytic or latent viral epitopes. However, a unique feature of MHV- 68 -induced IM is a prominent MHC haplotype-independent expansion of CD 8 (+) T cells, the majority of which utilize V(beta) 4 chains in their alpha beta TCR, The ligand driving the V(beta) 4 expansion is unknown, but the V-beta bias and MHC haplotype independence raised the possibility that these cells were responding to a virally encoded or a virally induced <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigen</b> (sAg), The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether this rapidly proliferating subset is composed of polyclonally or clonally expanded T cells. Complementarity-determining region (CDR) - 3 size analysis of V(beta) 4 (+) CD 8 (+) cells in infected mice demonstrated CDR 3 -restricted expansions in the V(beta) 4 family as a whole. More refined analysis demonstrated major distortions in every J(beta) subfamily. V-D-J junctional region sequencing indicated that these CDR 3 size-restricted expansions were composed of clonal or oligoclonal populations, The sequences were largely unique in individual mice, although evidence for 2 ̆ 7 public 2 ̆ 7 or highly conserved T cell expansions was also seen between different mice.

40|$|During their {{development}} in the thymus, immature T cells generate and express a unique T cell receptor (TCR) with a virtually random antigenic specificity. They are then subjected to rigorous selection processes that test their TCR’s ability to recognize {{a wide variety of}} presented self-antigens. According to the traditional model, only those immature T cells with an intermediate affinity for self-antigens, which are deemed functional yet not too autoreactive, are permitted to mature. Somewhat unexpectedly, recent studies have suggested that immature T cells destined to develop into regulatory T cells (Treg), an uncommon type of T cell that is involved in the inhibition of adaptive immune responses, are significantly more autoreactive than those that develop into conventional T cells. We tested this theory by investigating the influence of autoreactivity on the commitment of developing mouse T cells to the regulatory T cell lineage. We used an in vivo mouse model of developing T cell autoreactivity, in which developing T cells with a specific TCR V beta chain variant encounter and receive a very high affinity signal from an <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigen</b> protein, essentially mimicking a strong TCR signal. We observed an increased frequency of Tregs among the maturing survivors of this autoreactive population in one of our two models, as well as an increased frequency of NKT cells and T cells that express CD 103, an integrin protein implicated in T cell adhesion to epithelial cells. Our use of a transgenic Nur 77 -GFP reporter construct has enabled us to analyze the TCR signaling experience of the superantigen-reactive developing T cells.

We have used this model to analyze the possibility that direct stimulation of Mtv 7 + DBA/ 2 B cells by vSAg-responsive (VJ 36 +) BALB/c T cells can give rise to GCs. Injection of BALB/c SCID mice iv with 2 10 DBA/ 2 B cells, together with LPS, followed by 2 106 BALB/c T cells induces numerous large splenic GCs within 3 - 5 days. The GCs are still large on day 7, but are very much reduced by day 10. B cell activation with LPS is needed for this effect. These GCs form {{in spite of the}} apparent absence of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) as judged by staining for several FDC surface markers. Control mice receiving either BALB/c T or DBA/ 2 B cells + LPS alone or DBA/ 2 T + B cells + LPS fail to exhibit any GCs on days 3 - 7. Numerous small clusters of PNA + cells, but few large GCs are observed when TNF-R(p 55) -Ig is also injected, whereas LT 3 R-Ig treatment impeded the formation of aggregations of these cells even further, leaving scattered PNA + single cells and very small clumps throughout the white pulp of the spleens.

40|$|Peripheral T-cell antigen {{receptor}} V beta (TCRV beta) repertoire {{is influenced by}} clonal deletion both in the thymus and periphery. Developing thymocytes expressing certain TCRV beta are deleted by <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigens</b> presented on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in the thymus. Likewise, mature T cells bearing particular TCRV beta chains can be clonally deleted by superantigens in the periphery. The efficiency with which T cells expressing particular V beta subunits are deleted differs depending upon which coreceptor is expressed. Indeed, while deletion of V beta 11 + splenic T cells in CBA/J (Mls- 1, a I-E, + MTV 9 +) mice is quite efficient for CD 4 + spleen T cells, it is much less efficient for CD 8 + splenic T cells. If {{the difference in the}} efficiency of deletion is due solely to the coreceptor expressed, then a transgene encoding CD 4 should increase the efficiency with which CD 8 + cells are deleted. To address this question, we have produced CD 4 transgenic (TG) mice that express physiologic levels of CD 4 on all thymocytes and peripheral CD 8 T cells. CD 4 molecules expressed on CD 8 + splenic T cells were associated with P 56 lck tyrosine kinase, and were functional as evidenced by their ability to facilitate class II alloreactivity. Furthermore, we found that ectopic expression of TG CD 4 molecules on CD 8 + cells was able to affect the efficiency of deletion in response to superantigen stimulation. In particular, deletion of TCRV beta 11 + T cells was much less efficient for CD 8 + than for CD 4 + T-cell subpopulations in (CBA/J x B 6) F 1 mice. However, expression of the CD 4 transgene on CD 8 + splenic T cells from these mice increased the efficiency of deletion in the CD 8 + V beta 11 T cells. Interestingly, this effect was not observed in a mature CD 8 + thymocyte subpopulation. The results in this report demonstrate that CD 4 molecules are involved in peripheral deletion of TCRV beta 11 + T cells in (CBA/J x B 6) F 1 mice, and that the TCRV beta repertoire can be altered by ectopic expression of CD 4 on all T-lineage cells...|$|R
40|$|The <b>endogenous</b> viral <b>superantigen</b> 7 in DBA/ 2 mice {{serves as}} a target antigen on syngeneic ESb-MP {{lymphoma}} cells for allogeneic graft-vs-leukaemia reactive cells. Allogeneic viral superantigen 7 reactive Vβ 6 + T cells are able to transfer graft-vs-leukaemia reactivity and to kill specifically viral superantigen 7 + ESb-MP tumour cells in vitro. Here we elucidate the mechanism of this superantigen specific cell lysis. Already 10 [*]min after co-incubation with in vitro stimulated Vβ 6 + T cells, viral superantigen 7 + ESb-MP tumour cells show an apoptotic phenotype (Annexin V-positivity, DNA-fragmentation). This extremely rapid type of cell death is not mediated by the death inducing ligands CD 95 L, TRAIL and TNF but by perforin and granzyme B. Surprisingly, neither mitochondria nor any of the known caspases appear {{to be involved in}} this type of tumour cell killing. In contrast, nitric oxide, released by activated macrophages and endothelial cells, induces in the same tumour cells another type of apoptosis which is much slower and involves mitochondria and caspase activation. A synergistic effect between the two different effector mechanisms of superantigen reactive donor cytotoxic T lymphocytes and nitric oxide releasing host macrophages and endothelial cells might explain the effective immune rejection of even advanced metastasised cancer in this graft-vs-leukaemia animal model...|$|R
40|$|Protein Fv, an {{endogenous}} protein {{produced in}} the liver, is released in biological fluids during viral hepatitis. Acute and chronic viral hepatitis {{can be associated with}} cardiovascular derangements. Protein Fv induced the release of histamine, tryptase and the de novo synthesis of prostaglandin D 2 and cysteinyl leukotriene C 4 from mast cells isolated from human heart tissue (HHMC). Protein Fv absorbed with protein A-Sepharose coated with polyclonal IgG did not induce histamine secretion. The maximal percent histamine secretion induced by protein Fv correlated (rs = 0. 60; p < 0. 05) with that induced by anti-IgE, whereas there was no correlation between the release caused by proteins Fv and C 5 a. Preincubation of HHMC with protein Fv or anti-IgE caused complete cross-desensitization to subsequent challenge with heterologous stimulus. HHMC from which IgE had been dissociated no longer released histamine in response to anti-IgE and protein Fv. A human monoclonal IgE blocked both anti-IgE- and protein Fv-induced release. Three human monoclonal IgM VH 3 + inhibited protein-Fv-induced secretion of histamine from HHMC, whereas monoclonal IgM VH 6 + did not inhibit the release induced by protein Fv. Protein Fv acts as an <b>endogenous</b> immunoglobulin <b>superantigen</b> by interacting with the V H 3 domain of IgE to induce the release of mediators from HHMC...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the major intrathymic pathway of T cell differentiation, extrathymic pathways of such differentiation {{have been shown to}} exist in the liver and intestine. In particular, hepatic T cells of T cell receptors or CD 3 of intermediate levels (i. e., intermediate T cell receptor cells) always contain self-reactive clones and sometimes appear at other sites, including the target tissues in autoimmune diseases and the tumor sites in malignancies. To prove their extrathymic origin and self reactivity, in this study we used thymectomized, irradiated (B 6 x C 3 H/He) F 1 mice subjected to transplantation of bone marrow cells of B 6 mice. It was clearly demonstrated that all T cells generated under athymic conditions in the peripheral immune organs are intermediate CD 3 cells. In the case of nonthymectomized irradiated mice, not only intermediate CD 3 cells but also high CD 3 cells were generated. Phenotypic characterization showed that newly generated intermediate CD 3 cells were unique (e. g., interleukin 2 receptor alpha-/beta+ and CD 44 + L-selectin-) and were, therefore, distinguishable from thymus-derived T cells. The precursor cells of intermediate CD 3 cells in the bone marrow were Thy- 1 + CD 3 -.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 T cells produce diverse antigen receptors, {{including}} some with self-reactive specificities, {{through a process}} of somatic gene rearrangement. During the course of T cell development in the thymus, central tolerance eliminates self-reactive T cells. Self-reactive T cells that escape from the thymus can be tolerized in the periphery by multiple mechanisms including anergy and deletion. Peripheral CD 4 T cells expressing Vβ 5 undergo tolerance to an <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigen</b> encoded by mouse mammary tumor virus 8 (Mtv- 8) by either deletion or T cell receptor (TCR) revision. Revision is a process by which surface expression of the Vβ 5 + TCR is downregulated and recombination activating genes are expressed to drive rearrangement of the endogenous TCRβ locus, effecting cell rescue through the expression of a newly generated, non self reactive TCR. Previous research has conclusively demonstrated the extrathymic nature of revision, but the regulatory context in which this process takes place remains unclear. Revision is known to occur in the germinal center (GC), a site in which B cells and T cells interact to promote memory B cell formation and high-affinity antibody responses. GCs have a highly specific structure and require distinct cell interactions, which could contribute to a regulatory environment for revision. In this thesis, we present evidence that revising T cells phenotypically and functionally resemble follicular helper T cells, the T cells found in GCs, and that GCs are required for efficient revision. The GC is known to provide a confined space in which B cell antigen receptors undergo selection. Our data extend the role of this selective microenvironment into the arena of T cells, suggesting this fluid structure also provides a regulatory environment in which TCR revision can safely take place...|$|E
40|$|Most {{laboratory}} {{strains of}} mice have {{between two and}} eight endogenous superantigens. These viral superantigens (vSAGs) are coded by genes in the 3 ' long terminal repeats of endogenous mammary tumor viruses (Mtv's). A line of Mtv-negative mice and several lines of mice containing single Mtv's were created by inbreeding the F 2 progeny of CBA/CaJ and C 58 /J mice, which have no Mtv integrants in common. This allowed the T cell repertoire of H- 2 k mice, unaffected by Mtv superantigens, {{as well as the}} effects of vSAGs upon that repertoire, to be studied. Although each individual mouse had a different mix of C 58 /J and CBA/CaJ background genes, the T cell repertoires of different Mtv- negative mice were very similar and were reproducible. Since the background genes did not affect the V beta repertoire, there are no super-antigens, other than those encoded by Mtv's, that differ between CBA/CaJ and C 58 /J. CD 4 and CD 8 T cells had quite different repertoires in the Mtv-negative mice because of the effects of class I and class II major histocompatibility complex molecules on positive and negative selection. vSAG 3 was found to delete V beta 5 T cells, while vSAG 8 deleted V beta 7 T cells, and vSAG 9 deleted V beta 13 T cells in addition to their previously reported specificities. vSAG 17 deletes a small proportion of CD 4 + T cells bearing V beta 11 and - 12. vSAG 14 and - 30 have little effect on the T cell repertoire and are not expressed in thymocytes and splenocytes. An <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigen</b> that has a low avidity for a particular V beta may positively select thymocytes, leading to an increased frequency of peripheral T cells bearing the relevant V beta s. We found evidence that vSAG 11 may positively select T cells bearing V beta 8. 2. Our data, which analyzed the effects of seven endogenous Mtv's, showed little evidence of positive selection by any other vSAGs on T cells bearing any V beta tested, despite published reports to the contrary...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe earlier {{proposed}} {{that a human}} <b>endogenous</b> retroviral (HERV) <b>superantigen</b> (SAg) IDDMK 1, 222 may cause type I diabetes by activating autoreactive T cells. Viral infections and induction of interferon-α (IFN-α) are tightly associated {{with the onset of}} autoimmunity. Here we establish a link between viral infections and IFN-α-regulated SAg expression of the polymorphic and defective HERV-K 18 provirus. HERV-K 18 has three alleles, IDDMK 1, 222 and two full-length envelope genes, that all encode SAgs. Expression of HERV-K 18 SAgs is inducible by IFN-α and this is sufficient to stimulate Vβ 7 T cells to levels comparable to transfectants constitutively expressing HERV-K 18 SAgs. Endogenous SAgs induced via IFN-α by viral infections is a novel mechanism through which environmental factors may cause disease in genetically susceptible individuals...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis was to investigate how failure in the mechanisms that regulate self-tolerance can lead to autoimmune disease. In particular, I have studied {{a key player in}} immunological tolerance, the autoimmune regulator gene (AIRE). Mutations in this gene lead to a severe autoimmune disorder called autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I (APS I). APS I patients suffer from a combination of diseases caused by the immunological destruction of various tissues and organs, mainly the endocrine organs. The most common disease components are hypoparathyroidism, adrenocortical insufficiency and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC). It has been clearly shown that AIRE is involved in the negative selection of autoreactive thymocytes. The suggested mechanism is that AIRE induce expression of tissue-specific antigens (TSAs) in the thymus that are needed for the deletion of autoreactive thymocytes, but the exact molecular events and relative importance of this are controversial. The first publication on which this thesis is based, reports that AIRE is involved in the regulation of T cell-independent B cell-responses, and that B cells in Aire-/- mice have an increased activation status. This finding was thought to be connected to the increased serum levels of B cell activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF) found in both Aire-/- mice and APS I patients. The excessive BAFF was produced by AIRE-deficient dendritic cells upon IFN-gamma stimulation, which was independent of the presence of autoreactive T cells. It was suggested that AIRE regulates peripheral tolerance by inhibiting STAT 1 signaling downstream of the IFN-gamma receptor. The second paper describes how AIRE deficiency results in impaired development of iNKT cells, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of APS I. This finding suggests that AIRE has other functions apart from inducing TSAs in the thymus, given that iNKT cells recognize lipid antigens and are not dependent on ectopic peptide expression in the thymus for their development. In the third paper, the mechanisms behind CMC in APS I are described. It is shown that APS I patients have defects in innate immune mechanisms, i. e. the anti-fungal activity of the saliva. The patients exhibit IgA autoantibodies recognizing salivary glands as an indication of ongoing immunological destruction. Furthermore, they lack expression of salivary cystatin SA 1, a protein with potent anti-fungal activity. The final paper describes investigations into possible mechanisms governing thymocyte development in the absence of AIRE. This was performed in a system independent of TSA expression where <b>endogenous</b> <b>superantigens</b> mediate selection and activation of transgenic T cells specific for an ovalbumin peptide presented by H 2 -IAb (OT-II T cells). It was found that the OT-II T cells were reduced in Aire-/- mice compared to wild type littermates, and showed an immature phenotype. It was also found that the OT-II Aire-/- mice had increased TCR revision after activation in peripheral organs. The findings in Aire-/- mice and APS I patients presented in this thesis are not explained by reduced TSA expression in the thymus. They show that AIRE has additional functions in both central and peripheral tolerance...|$|R
40|$|Gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALTs) {{interact}} with intestinal microflora to drive GALT development and diversify the primary antibody repertoire; however, the molecular mechanisms that link these events remain elusive. Alicia rabbits provide an excellent model {{to investigate the}} relationship between GALT, intestinal microflora, and modulation of the antibody repertoire. Most B cells in neonatal Alicia rabbits express VHn allotype immunoglobulin (Ig) M. Within weeks, the number of VHn B cells decreases, whereas VHa allotype B cells increase in number and become predominant. We hypothesized that the repertoire shift from VHn to VHa B cells results from interactions between GALT and intestinal microflora. To test this hypothesis, we surgically removed organized GALT from newborn Alicia pups and ligated the appendix to sequester it from intestinal microflora. Flow cytometry and nucleotide sequence analyses revealed that the VHn to VHa repertoire shift did not occur, demonstrating the requirement for interactions between GALT and intestinal microflora in the selective expansion of VHa B cells. By comparing amino acid sequences of VHn and VHa Ig, we identified a putative VH ligand binding site for a bacterial or <b>endogenous</b> B cell <b>superantigen.</b> We propose that interaction of such a superantigen with VHa B cells results in their selective expansion...|$|R
