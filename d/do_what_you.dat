5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British hoped, they withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: {{that the key to}} deception was not to make your enemy think what you wish but to get them to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want.|$|E

That is not Justice Brown's philosophy. It is simply intellectually dishonest and logically incoherent to suggest that somehow the Constitution recognizes an unlimited right to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want with your private property and yet does not recognize a right to privacy that would forbid the Government from intruding in your bedroom. Yet {{that seems to be the}} manner in which Justice Brown would interpret our most cherished document.|$|E

25|$|The chroniclers of the First Crusade {{documented}} the chance interception {{of a message}} warning the duke of Caesarea of {{the coming of the}} Crusader armies when a carrier pigeon was felled by a hawk over a Crusader military encampment in May 1099. The message, written in Arabic, read as follows:Greetings from the king of Acre to the duke of Caesarea. A generation of dogs, a foolish, headstrong, disorderly race, has gone through my land. If you value your way of life, you and others of the faith should bring harm to them, since you can easily <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> wish. Transmit this message to other cities and strongholds. Carrier pigeons were regularly used in this period. For example, Edward Gibbon notes that during the siege of Acre (1189–1191) by the Crusaders, the inhabitants of the besieged city kept a regular correspondence with the Sultan's forces by way of carrier pigeon.|$|E
25|$|Tensely, {{people watch}} for the hurricane's arrival. The men sing a hymn-like admonition not to be afraid. Jim meditatively compares Nature's savagery to the far greater destructiveness of Man. Why do we build, he asks, {{if not for the}} {{pleasure}} of destroying? Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear makes no sense. For the sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you want another man's money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy's philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick’s enemies, the federal agents. Begbick and her cohorts take it as a sign that Jimmy is right; they join him, Jenny, and his three friends in singing a new, defiant song: If someone walks on, then it's me, and if someone gets walked on, then it's you. In the background, the men continue to chant their hymn as the hurricane draws nearer.|$|E

500|$|The first commandment, {{according}} to Church teaching, [...] "means that [...] must worship and adore God alone because God is alone."

Augustine interpreted this commandment as [...] "Love God and then <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will". Explaining this sentiment, Kreeft states that all sin [...] "serves some other god, obeys another commander: the world or the flesh or the devil", if God truly be loved then one will do what God wills.|$|E

500|$|There {{is a broad}} {{practical}} bent to {{both the}} Perl language and the community and culture that surround it. The preface to Programming Perl begins: [...] "Perl is a language for getting your job done." [...] One consequence {{of this is that}} Perl is not a tidy language. It includes many features, tolerates exceptions to its rules, and employs heuristics to resolve syntactical ambiguities. Because of the forgiving nature of the compiler, bugs can sometimes be hard to find. Perl's function documentation remarks on the variant behavior of built-in functions in list and scalar contexts by saying, [...] "In general, they <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want, unless you want consistency." ...|$|E

Terry was spitting rage at the system, at the Weinsteins. You can't try and impose big compromises on a visionary director like him.

[...] She also emphasized loving her country, in response to criticism for her previous statements about feeling proud of her country for the first time, where the original statement was seen as a gaffe.

[...] Davis continued, [...] "All the great bands around are on that label and everything seems to just work out right and it seems like a good home for us right now." [...] The lead single, [...] "Oildale", was made available for streaming in May 2010. [...] "Oildale (Leave Me Alone)" [...] was simultaneously released to radio stations, and became a top-ten hit on the Billboard Active rock and Mainstream Rock airplay charts.
