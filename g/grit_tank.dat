40|$|Nitrous oxide {{emissions}} from an {{activated sludge plant}} which serves a research institute in Rio de Janeiro city were estimated from six unit processes (<b>grit</b> <b>tank,</b> sand trap, aeration tank, secondary settling tank, sludge recirculation line and aerobic digester sludge tank) and also from the plant effluent. Total estimated annual flux was 3. 2 x 10 (4) g N 2 O yr- 1 of which about 90 % was from the aeration tank. Emission factors estimated from population served, wastewater flow and nitrogen load (conversion ratio) were 13 g N 2 O person- 1 yr- 1, 9. 0 x 10 - 5 g N 2 O Lwastewater- 1 and 0. 14 %...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} make a better {{understanding}} of the characteristics of N 2 O emission in A/O wastewater treatment plant, full-scale and pilot-scale experiments were carried out and a back propagation artificial neural network model based on the experimental data was constructed to make a precise prediction of N 2 O emission. Results showed that, N 2 O flux from different units followed a descending order: aerated <b>grit</b> <b>tank</b> > oxic zone ≫ anoxic zone > final clarifier > primary clarifier, but 99. 4 % of the total emission of N 2 O (1. 60 % of N-load) was monitored from the oxic zone due to its big surface area. A proper DO control could reduce N 2 O emission down to 0. 21 % of N-load in A/O process, and a two-hidden-layers back propagation model with an optimized structure of 4 : 3 : 9 : 1 could achieve a good simulation of N 2 O emission, which provided a new method for the prediction of N 2 O emission during wastewater treatment. © 201...|$|E
5000|$|The North of England Lead Mining Museum at Killhope {{has a huge}} working water wheel, {{known as}} the Killhope Wheel. This was {{installed}} in the 1870s to power the crushing of <b>grit</b> in <b>tanks</b> in an adjacent building, so as to complete the separation of lead ore from worthless stone. The museum also exhibits a fine collection of local minerals, as well as [...] "spar boxes" [...] - display cases made by miners to show crystal specimens they had themselves found.|$|R
30|$|Daspoort Wastewater Treatment Works {{is located}} on the {{southern}} bank of Apies River, north-western side of Pretoria Central Business District, South Africa. It is designed to treat 60 million litres of wastewater per day. The DWWTW employs the bio-filtration and activated sludge methods at its eastern and western works, respectively. The experiment was carried out at the western works, which comprises of screens, <b>grit</b> removal <b>tanks,</b> primary sedimentation tanks, activated sludge and secondary sedimentation tanks. The influent into the western works undergoes preliminary treatment in the coarse screen, fine screen and grit removal chamber after which it is channelled to the primary sedimentation tank.|$|R
40|$|Three {{full-scale}} {{wastewater treatment}} processes, Orbal oxidation ditch, anoxic/anaerobic/aerobic (reversed A(2) O) and anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic (A(2) O), {{were selected to}} investigate the emission characteristics of greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Results showed that although the processes were different, the units presenting high GHG emission fluxes were remarkably similar, namely the highest CO 2 and N 2 O emission fluxes occurred in the aerobic areas, and the highest CH 4 emission fluxes occurred in the <b>grit</b> <b>tanks.</b> The GHG emission amount of each unit can be calculated from its area and GHG emission flux. The calculation results revealed that the maximum emission amounts of CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O in the three wastewater treatment processes appeared in the aerobic areas in all cases. Theoretically, CH 4 should be produced in anaerobic conditions, rather than aerobic conditions. However, results in {{this study showed that}} the CH 4 emission fluxes in the forepart of the aerobic area were distinctly higher than in the anaerobic area. The situation for N 2 O was similar to that of CH 4 : the N 2 O emission flux in the aerobic area was also higher than that in the anoxic area. Through analysis of the GHG mass balance, {{it was found that the}} flow of dissolved GHG in the wastewater treatment processes and aerators may be the main reason for this phenomenon. Based on the monitoring and calculation results, GHG emission factors for the three wastewater treatment processes were determined. The A(2) O process had the highest CO 2 emission factor of 319. 3 g CO 2 /kg CODremoved, and the highest CH 4 and N 2 O emission factors of 3. 3 g CH 4 /kg CODremoved and 3. 6 g N 2 O/kg TNremoved were observed in the Orbal oxidation ditch process...|$|R

The plant is designed for 5000 person equivalent (p. e.) in winter and 8200 p. e. in summer; it is made of primary treatments (screen, sand and <b>grit</b> removal, buffer <b>tank,</b> rotary drum screen), predenitrification (220 m 3), oxidation (370 m 3) with ferric chloride dosage, membrane tank (250 m 3) equipped with Kubota plane membrane (total filtration area 3600 m 2), deoxygenation tank (115 m 3), disinfection with sodium hypochlorite, sludge thickening and dewatering by centrifugation. In 2012, on average basis the plant treated 733 m 3 d- 1 wastewater with 442 mgL- 1 COD, 253 mgL- 1 BOD, 38. 1 mgL- 1 TKN; removal efficiencies were 86 % for COD, 96 % for BOD, 93 % for TKN and 74 % for total nitrogen. Permeate flux varied in the range 4 – 24 Lm- 2 h- 1 and negative pressure in the range 85 – 300 mbar; membranes were backwashed with sodium hypochlorite once a month...|$|R
