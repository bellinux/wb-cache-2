It is currently {{owned and operated}} by the fourth generation of the Dalton family. The company specializes in the production of pickles and condiment products and currently holds the title of # 1 retail brand of pickles in the state of Texas. In addition to the Best Maid label, products are also produced under the Del-Dixie label. The objective of this thesis is to analyze a potential capital project: a bucket line replacement. The analysis will be completed by using net present value to determine the cost and benefits of the project. The focus of the project will be the food service bucket line. The current line was designed and installed over 20 years ago. Currently, this line and supporting resources require a staff of 17 employees to operate. The process is looking to be improved through advances in technology including vibratory conveyors, more complex PLC programming, and increased accuracy of scaling equipment. Implementing these advancements has the potential to reduce the employee labor cost as well as decrease over-scaling. The goal of this project is to inform the Best Maid owners of the investment costs, labor savings, benefits, and the financial viability of the proposed capital investment. Best Maid has consistently grown at a high single digit to low double <b>digit</b> <b>rate</b> each year. Businesses must continually identify and react to the needs of tomorrow, today. Formal processes within the business will be established to evaluate and prioritize future potential projects.

40|$|Recent events, {{historical}} evidence and geographical proximity {{suggest that the}} six EFTAns and twelve Central and East European countries (CEECs) are natural trading partners. This paper evaluates this suggestion by estimating the potential for EFTA-CEEC trade using the gravity model of Wang and Winters (1991). The findings show that even at 1989 CEEC income levels, EFTA-CEEC trade should have been four times greater than it was. Thus the CEEC markets should have been as important to Austria, Iceland and Switzerland as were the EFTA markets. A second estimation is carried out assuming that CEECs' incomes catch up to 70 % of the EC's by 2005, 2010 and 2020. In this scenario, EFTA-CEEC trade grows at double <b>digit</b> <b>rates</b> for decades, finally attaining a level where CEEC markets account for almost a fifth of EFTA members' exports to all of Europe.

The overexploitation of the ‘commons’ upon which the industry has grown and the lack of an adequate regulatory mechanism to monitor adverse environmental effects contributed to this disaster, which now threatens the future of the industry and the country benefiting from its natural comparative advantage for salmon farming.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{economic}} policies {{pursued by the}} Concertación government of President Patricio Aylwin (1990 - 94). As background, it briefly analyzes {{the policies of the}} preceding military regime (1973 - 1990). The main themes of the paper are the issues of continuity and change in economic policy, and the central challenges facing the Chilean economy in the mid 1990 s. By March 1994 Chile had undergone one decade of uninterrupted growth at around 7 percent per year, inflation was on the way to single <b>digit</b> <b>rates,</b> and the external position of the country was extremely solid. These achievements occurred during a transition from military rule to democracy. Despite some fears stemming from the opposition's victory in the presidential elections of 1989, Chile's economic model has been deepened and legitimized in democracy. More continuity than change has been perceived in economic policies, and growth has continued unabated. However, Chile continues to face significant challenges ahead in the m nagement of domestic stabilization in the context of large capital mobility, in the consolidation of a strong and stable economic growth path, and in the elimination of poverty...|$|R
40|$|Spain has {{the most}} serious and {{persistent}} unemployment problem in Europe, with an unemployment rate that reached 24. 6 percent in early 1994. This paper explores the characteristics of this unemployment problem, its causes, and provides a brief discussion of recent labor market reform measures and their likely Impact. A demographic shift {{in recent years has}} produced a large rise in female labor force participation and a decrease in agricultural jobs to which the economy has been unable to adjust. The effects of generous unemployment benefits and the large underground economy may explain 6 – 12 percentage points of the resulting unemployment, but the remainder must be explained by failures and rigidities in the labor market. The paper presents econometric evidence that unemployment displays hysteresis, and that wages are not responsive to changes in the unemployment rate. This evidence supports the claim that insider-outsider factors and rigidities in the legal structure of the labor market are responsible for much of the high unemployment rate. Recent reforms have improved the functioning of the labor market, but they are unlikely to be sufficient to reduce unemployment to single <b>digit</b> <b>rates</b> without further action. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{parallel}} with a flourishing economy, {{the natural gas}} industry in Spain was characterised by rapid consumption growth in the late 1990 s and 2000 s. Infrastructure and supplies were {{designed to meet the}} needs of a gas market growing at double <b>digit</b> <b>rates</b> each year. This high growth rate – for a European gas market – was expected to continue until at least the mid- 2010 s. By 2011, this outlook was replaced by a more pessimistic one. Firstly, the country’s economy was hit hard by the global recession and GDP growth recovered later than average for Europe. Secondly, the utilisation of Spain’s CCGTs dropped from 52 % in 2008 to only 33 % in 2010 as a result of an increasing use of renewable energy – especially wind and hydropower – to produce electricity. This raises the question of whether the expectation of gas demand in the Spanish power sector is ever going to materialise. The objective of this paper is to investigate the state of the Spanish gas market and its potential for growth. Will the negative impacts on the gas market be short lived or is there a need to review the scenarios to incorporate new dynamics relative to economic growth and renewable energy use? What will the consequence be of these changes on the gas industry...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the growth of unemployment in Europe in the late 70 s and early 80 s. Unemployment has risen to double <b>digit</b> <b>rates</b> in many countries, rates which are not considered likely to fall much {{in the rest of the}} 80 s. A theory [...] 'the disease' [...] is expounded, with empirical evidence from the Federal Republic of Germany. The disease is characterized by high unemployment and low output growth, these being systematic rather than the consequence of some temporary phenomenon such as the downphase of the business cycle. Consequently we present a 'natural rate' explanation as an underlying determinant of unemployment with consideration given to the role of the business cycle in recent German unemployment. The latter role is examined with the use of a full macroeconomic model of the Federal Republic. The model is new-classical with two of its most distinguishing features being the assumption of rational expectations throughout and the endogenous determination of natural rates. We find that the natural rate of unemployment in Germany more than trebled its 1973 level by the end of the 70 s, reaching 1. 21 million by 1982 before falling to 1. 16 million in 1983. We suggest that Germany may have caught the now familiar 'British disease' [...] that is, the prevention of real wage adjustment, via unemployment benefits and social aid.
