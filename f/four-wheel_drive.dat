5|$|<b>Four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> {{was decided}} against {{early in the}} {{development}} process, {{for a number of}} reasons. It was thought rear-wheel drive would be adequate in the majority of situations, that the additional complexity of the <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system would hinder the development process and potentially be problematic for the customer. FF Developments were contracted to provide the gearbox/transaxle assembly, modifying their <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> transaxle assembly from the XJ220 concept into a pure rear-wheel drive design for the production car. A five-speed gearbox is fitted; a six-speed gearbox was considered but deemed unnecessary, as the torque characteristics of the engine made a sixth gear redundant. The transaxle featured a viscous coupling limited slip differential to improve traction.|$|E
5|$|Jaguar {{had little}} {{experience}} with <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> systems at the time, having previously only produced rear-wheel drive cars. Randle approached Tony Rolt's company, FF Developments {{to design the}} transmission and <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system for the XJ220, with Rolt's son Stuart running the project. Tony Rolt was the Technical Director of Ferguson Research, where he was heavily involved {{in the design of}} the <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system used in the Jensen FF, the first sports car to be fitted with such a transmission. Tony Rolt also had a long involvement with Jaguar, winning the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans with the factory works team driving the Jaguar C-Type.|$|E
5|$|The {{site and}} the light are {{operated}} by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The island {{can be reached by}} ferry service from Scarborough, though visiting requires a permit and a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> is mandatory. The station is accessible, but the lighthouse is closed to the public.|$|E

50|$|Since the 2007 model redesign, the Navigator {{no longer}} {{uses the same}} {{transfer}} case as the Expedition. Expedition <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drives</b> continue to use a two-speed dual range transfer case with off-road low range reduction gearing and default off-road program that remaps (reprograms) the electronic throttle control and traction control system response for off-road conditions. Navigator <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drives</b> have been demoted to a light-duty one-speed single range transfer case which lacks low range gearing.|$|R
50|$|<b>Four-wheel</b> <b>drives</b> are {{permitted}} to drive on most areas of Stockton Beach but are excluded from the extreme ends of the beach.|$|R
5|$|Ambulance design {{must take}} into account local {{conditions}} and infrastructure. Maintained roads are necessary for road going ambulances to arrive on scene and then transport the patient to a hospital, though in rugged areas <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> or all-terrain vehicles can be used. Fuel must be available and service facilities are necessary to maintain the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|As of 2011 the police's new {{patrol cars}} are <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> Volkswagen Passat with {{automatic}} transmission. New transport cars are Mercedes-Benz Vito for light transport and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter for heavy transport. The police force operates two Eurocopter EC135 helicopters, {{which are based}} at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. In addition, the Emergency Response Unit can use the Royal Norwegian Air Force's Bell 412 helicopters.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s were {{challenging}} for Holden and the Australian automotive industry. The Australian Government tried {{to revive the}} industry with the Button car plan, which encouraged car makers to focus on producing fewer models at higher, more economical volumes, and to export cars. The decade opened with the shut-down of the Pagewood, New South Wales production plant and introduction of the light commercial Rodeo, sourced from Isuzu in Japan. The Rodeo was available in both two- and <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> chassis cab models {{with a choice of}} petrol and diesel powerplants. The range was updated in 1988 with the TF series, based on the Isuzu TF. Other cars sourced from Isuzu during the 1980s were the <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> Jackaroo (1981), the Shuttle (1982) van and the Piazza (1986) three-door sports hatchback. The second generation Holden Gemini from 1985 was also based on an Isuzu design, although, its manufacture was undertaken in Australia.|$|E
50|$|The service {{also uses}} not just {{aircraft}} but also <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drives</b> and other utility land vehicles {{to aid in}} transportation and communications.|$|R
50|$|Except for the Holden Cruze, {{these are}} all {{relatively}} large cars developed specifically for Australians. Smaller cars sold in Australia are all imported, as are <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|R

5|$|The mid-engine {{complicated}} {{the design of}} the <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system, and an innovative solution was needed to get drive {{from the rear of the}} engine to the front wheels. The chosen design took the front-wheel drive from the central differential on the rear transaxle and sent it through the V in the centre of the engine using a quill drive, before joining an inverted differential. The clutch was a twin-plate unit designed by AP Racing.|$|E
5|$|A mugging {{at gunpoint}} in 1854 reputedly {{led to the}} {{establishment}} of a park police force. Until 2005 the park was policed by the separate Royal Parks Constabulary but that has now been subsumed into the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police. The mounted police have been replaced by a patrol team in a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> vehicle. In 2015 the Friends of Richmond Park expressed concern about plans to cut the numbers of police in the park to half the level that they were ten years previously, despite an increase in visitor numbers and in incidents of crime.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September 2007, eight {{members of}} the team (including five runners dressed as bodyguards) and three hired chauffeurs manned a fake Canadian {{motorcade}} consisting of two motorcycles, two black <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> vehicles, and a black sedan. The group—including Chas Licciardello dressed as Osama bin Laden, and Julian Morrow—drove the motorcade through the Sydney central business district and breached the APEC security zone. The premise of the stunt was that bin Laden should have been invited to the summit as a world leader, to discuss the War on Terror, with another motive being to test the event's security. The stunt was approved by ABC lawyers under the assumption that the motorcade would be stopped at the first security checkpoint and denied entry.|$|E
25|$|Useful {{features}} of the smaller Jeeps are their short wheelbases, narrow frames, and ample approach, breakover, and departure angles, allowing them to fit into places where full-size <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drives</b> have difficulty.|$|R
50|$|This route starts 15 km east {{around the}} Mount Kenya Ring Road from Nanyuki. The gate is 10 km further along the track, {{which can be}} walked or <b>driven</b> by <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two-wheel drive models, {{which the}} <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drives</b> had outsold from the beginning, were {{discontinued}} after the 1967 model year, {{and at the}} end of 1968, the slow-selling two-door versions were also discontinued.|$|R
5|$|General manager Kytölä {{travelled}} to France and West Germany in 1947 {{and early}} 1948 to buy military surplus {{materials from the}} Western Allies. He bought 425 White Motor Company M2 Half-Track vehicles, 186 lorry engines, 304 Cadillac V8 engines, 4 Mack ED diesel engines, 2 Hercules Diesel DFXE engines, 11,000 GMC wheels and one 45-tonne-capacity trailer. Trading was organised through the Ministry of Supply and the first delivery arrived in March 1948. The White Half-Track vehicles were without armour; Kytölä's idea was to equip them with superstructures for field or forest clearing, or to convert them into <b>Four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> lorries by replacing the tracks with a conventional rear axle. In total, VAT sold 359 units as half-tracks, and 60 were converted into 4×4 or 4×2 vehicles. These lorries were sold as Vanaja VaWh. Some of the half-track vehicles were scrapped for parts; the last was sold in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{insertion}} were considered, {{both for the}} paras and the special forces personnel, including an overland approach using <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> vehicles, and a water-borne insertion using the same method by which the SAS observation teams had arrived at their position. The planning group decided that the overland approach would not allow troops to enter the village undetected, {{largely due to the}} West Side Boys' roadblocks on the road into the village, and that insertion from Rokel Creek was not feasible for large numbers of troops due to the sandbanks and powerful currents in the river. Thus, it was decided that the insertions would be made from three Royal Air Force Chinook helicopters from No. 7 Squadron, which had been in Sierra Leone since the beginning of Operation Palliser.|$|E
25|$|A <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> is {{required}} for all landings (except Kingfisher Bay), and travel on the island (except within the Kingfisher Bay Resort). A permit {{is required}} for vehicles and is obtainable on-line from DERM and several outlets at Rainbow Beach. Several firms provide <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> vehicles for hire.|$|E
5000|$|Muir {{said that}} as a young man, he was {{interested}} in customising cars, but as he gained a family, he moved on to <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drives</b> as a way to explore the countryside. He wanted to keep the country open for <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drives</b> to explore. About four months before the election, he discovered the AMEP on social networking sites. He was preselected for the election without having met the party leaders. He had no political experience. He calls himself an [...] "average Australian" [...] and wanted to make [...] "balanced decision which reflects on hopefully the everyday Australian".|$|R
50|$|Mucanagh {{is liable}} to {{flooding}} though this is disregarded by many locals who use tractors or <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drives</b> into {{or out of the}} townland. The dredging of the Suck in the 1970s never had the anticipated results.|$|R

25|$|Daimler-Benz {{also has}} a history in <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive.</b> In 1907 the Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft had built a four-wheel-driven vehicle called Dernburg-Wagen, also {{equipped}} with four-wheel steering, that was used by German colonial civil servant, Bernhard Dernburg, in Namibia. Mercedes and BMW, in 1926, introduced a rather sophisticated <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> the G1, the G4 and G4 following. The 1937 Mercedes-Benz G5 and BMW 325 4×4 featured full-time <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> four-wheel steering, three locking differentials, and fully independent suspension. They were produced because of a government demand for a four-wheel-drive passenger vehicle. The modern G-series/Wolf such as the G500 and G55 AMG still feature some of the attributes, {{with the exception of}} fully independent suspension since it hinders suspension articulation. The Unimog is another Mercedes truck.|$|E
50|$|Bus {{services}} {{operate in}} Hargeisa, Burao, Gabiley, Berbera and Borama. There are also road transportation services between the major towns and adjacent villages, which are operated by {{different types of}} vehicles. Among these are taxis, <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drives,</b> minibuses and light goods vehicles (LGV).|$|R
50|$|Some buyers choose SUVs {{because they}} have more {{interior}} space than sedans of similar sizes. In areas with gravel roads in summer and snow and ice in winter, <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drives</b> offer a safety advantage due to their traction advantages under these conditions.|$|R
50|$|The Ulidarra National Park {{comprises}} huge forests. Picturesque {{rain forests}} and ancient eucalyptus trees adorn the park. These forests sustain {{a variety of}} bird life. Other recreational facilities in the park include majestic coastal views, trails for <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drives,</b> tracks for biking and walking.|$|R

25|$|The <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> system (4MATIC) was {{available}} from 1987 with 2.6- and 3.0-litre petrol and 3.0-litre diesel engines with 12 valves. It {{was not available}} with coupés and convertibles. From 1987 to 1989, the <b>four-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> cars (except the turbocharged diesel) had five-speed manual transmission as standard, with optional four-speed automatic. From 1990, the manual transmission {{was available}} only with 260 E, and the larger engines were available only with four-speed automatic.|$|E
