40|$|The subject under {{consideration}} is the conception {{and significance of}} special drawing rights and {{the main reason for}} the introduction of the new international monetary unit. Also indicated is the fundamental difference between the drawing rights and the spacial drawing rights. To meet the need as and when it arises for supplement to existing reserve assets the Fund is authorized to allocate special drawing rights to members that are participants in the Special Drawing Account. The new international unit, commonly known as SDR (Special Drawing Rights) or gold paper was introduced in January 1970. It's parity is 0, 88671 g of fine gold, thus equal to the US dollar. It is expressed in dollars but not US dollars. It is issued by the IMF. The grounds for issuing is mutual committance {{of the participants in the}} Special Drawing Account, to use the SDR as a means of payment in international settlement of payments. The introduction of SDR constitutes a further step in <b>demonetization</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold,</b> but does not yet mean its full demonetization. SDR is demonetized gold, despite its parity in gold. Here gold plays the role of a yardstick of international measure of values. The introduction of SDR has positive influence on international liquidity thanks to the possibility for supplement to existing reserve assets. Though reducing it does not however, eliminate all the difficulties of those countries which have a long-standing debit balance of payments.

40|$|The main {{thought of}} the article is the opinion of {{progressing}} phenomenon of <b>demonetization</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> as international reserve currency. Gold as world currency is a restrictive element {{in the range of}} international trades' turnover. It is the restraint of the expansion of world trade that has always had the increasing tendency. In that way you can explain the increase of the position of the United States' dollar as the key currency. National currency performing a duty of international currency in the longway perspective is an embryo of currency crisis and the source of conflicts and contradictions in capitalistic countries. Gold and dollar as international currency can be replaced by international fiduciary currency. Precursor of this conception is Keynes. The author discussed the mechanism of regulation the exchane rates and mechanisms of accomodation in the range of deficits of payments and analised the role of International Monetary Fund. The author pointed that in that range the role of gold is not of basical importance. The essential role of gold is its function as the comparative measure of currency. Price of gold is of conventional character. There were discussed modern international conceptions of fiduciary currency of Prof. R. Triffin and the plan of reform of the International Monetary Fund that depended on introduction of Special Drawing Rights (SDR). Special Drawing Rights are based on international account unit that equals one gold dollar. Finishing his article the author distinguished international fiduciary currency from supranational fiduciary currency. The supranational fiduciary currency is above all the political conception not only organizational or economical one.

25|$|The Panic of 1873 and the {{subsequent}} depression had several underlying causes, of which economic historians debate the relative importance.

Major findings of this paper include a positive but statistically insignificant correlation between demonetization and growth in the shadow economy, and a statistically significant positive relationship between exchange rate appreciation and demonetization.

2500|$|A similar {{process of}} over-expansion {{had taken place}} in Germany and Austria, where the period from German {{unification}} in 1870/71 to the crash in 1873 came to be called the [...] ("founders' years"). A liberalized incorporation law in Germany gave impetus to the foundation of new enterprises, such as the , and the incorporation of already established ones. Euphoria over the military victory against France in 1871 and the influx of capital from the payment by France of war reparations fueled stock market speculation in railways, factories, docks, steamships – the same industrial branches that expanded unsustainably in the United States.

50|$|The <b>demonetization</b> <b>of</b> postage {{and revenue}} stamps {{is the process}} by which the stamps are {{rendered}} no longer valid. In general, stamp demonetization is a rare event, since any unused stamp is effectively equivalent to its face value, and there is no financial disadvantage if postal customers use old stamps on their mail. Demonetization chiefly occurs in connection with major upheavals in the postal system, such as a transfer from one country to another, or currency changes, such as decimalisation, or a change of government. The process of exchanging millions or billions of stamps in the public's hands, plus that of exchanging post office stock, is usually complicated and difficult, and offers much interest for students of postal history.|$|R
