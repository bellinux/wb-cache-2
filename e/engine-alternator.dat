50|$|Provision (foundations) {{was made}} for the {{addition}} of three more reciprocating steam <b>engine-alternator</b> sets, but this was abandoned in favour of turbo-alternators.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1960s a few models of a new locomotive, with Co-Co bogies and {{electric}} transmission, were built at the Hipolit Cegielski Metal Works in Pozna≈Ñ. In general, all prototypes differed by <b>engine-alternator</b> combination. The final decision was to use a Fiat-licensed engine and an Alsthom-licensed alternator.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the dynamic {{behavior of a}} Free-Piston Stirling Engine/linear alternator (FPSE/LA) driving a single-phase fractional horse-power induction motor. The controllability and dynamic stability of the system are discussed by means of sensitivity effects of variations in system parameters, engine controller, operating conditions, and mechanical loading on the induction motor. The approach used expands on a combined mechanical and thermodynamic formulation employed in a previous paper. The application of state-space technique and frequency domain analysis enhances understanding of the dynamic interactions. <b>Engine-alternator</b> parametric sensitivity studies, {{similar to those of}} the previous paper, are summarized. Detailed discussions are provided for parametric variations which relate to the engine controller and system operating conditions. The results suggest that the controllability of a FPSE-based power system is enhanced by proper operating conditions and built-in controls...|$|E
40|$|The {{first phase}} of the present study of Stirling engine {{alternatives}} for solar thermal-electric generation has been completed. Development risk levels are considered to be high for all engines evaluated. Free-piston type and Ringbom-type Stirling <b>engine-alternators</b> are not yet developed for the 25 to 50 -kW electrical power range, although smaller machines have demonstrated the inherent robustness of the machines. Kinematic-type Stirling engines are presently achieving a 3500 hr lifetime or longer on critical components, and lifetime must still be further extended for the solar application. Operational and technical characteristics of all types of Stirling engines have been reviewed with engine developers. Technical work of merit in progress in each engine development organization should be recognized and supported in an appropriate manner...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} status and test {{results for the}} Small Community Solar Thermal Power Experiment are presented. Activities on the phase 2 power module development effort are presented with emphasis on the receiver, the plant control subsystem, and the energy transport subsystem. The components include a single prototype power module consisting of a parabolic dish concentrator, a power conversion assembly (PCA), and a multiple-module plant control subsystem. The PCA consists of a cavity receiver coupled to an organic Rankine cycle <b>engine-alternator</b> unit defined as the power conversion subsystem; the PCA is mounted at {{the focus of a}} parabolic dish concentrator. At a solar insolation of 100 W/sq m and ambient temperature of 28 C (82 F), the power module produces approximately 20 kW of 3 -phase, 3 kHz ac power, depending on the concentrator employed. A ground-mounted rectifier to the central collection site where it is supplied directly to the common dc bus which collects the power from all modules in the plant...|$|E
