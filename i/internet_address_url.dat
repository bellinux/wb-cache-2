40|$|Abstract. Phishing attacks rise in {{quantity}} and quality. With short online lifetimes of those attacks, classical blacklist based approaches are not su cient to protect online users. While attackers manage to achieve high similarity between original and fraudulent websites, this fact {{can also be}} used for attack detection. In many cases attackers try to make the <b>Internet</b> <b>address</b> (<b>URL)</b> from a website look similar to the original. In this work, we present a way of using the URL itself for automated detection of phishing websites by extracting and verifying di erent terms of a URL using search engine spelling recommendation. We evaluate our concept against a large test set of 8730 real phishing URLs. In addition, we collected scores for the visual quality of a subset of those attacks to be able to compare the performance of our tests for di erent attack qualities. Results suggest that our heuristics are able to mark 54. 3 % of the malicious URLs as suspicious. With increasing visual quality of the phishing websites, the number of URL characteristics that allow a detection increases, as well. ...|$|E
40|$|Postmodern {{society is}} {{characterized}} by information overload. In the scientific and academic sector alone {{there are more than}} 100, 000 journals and 80, 000 new books published each year, also a vast number of electronic documents. There are about 170 million hosts on the WWW, with an estimated 500 million sites. The number of serious scientific documents published solely in an electronic form is increasing constantly. It is becoming more difficult to identify relevant information and documents, so {{there is a need for}} a unique and permanent identifier for electronic documents. Although it is possible to identify print products unambiguously according to a uniform world-wide standard (ISBN, ISSN), this is not yet the case for electronic documents. At the moment, the <b>internet</b> <b>address</b> (<b>URL)</b> is frequently used to cite and retrieve the documents. However, URLs may change and the publications then frequently simply disappear. Clear and permanent identification systems are therefore necessary so that online publications can be cited, retrieved and used. Libraries in particular are very interested in a unique and permanent identifier for electronic documents. Two different systems, the uniform resource name (URN) and the digital object identifier (DOI), are presented as examples of ways in which electronic publications can be identified...|$|E

40|$|The Internet is a {{powerful}} medium for communication and an innovative tool for facilitating health promotion messages. Access to the Internet continues to grow among adolescents in the United States and the Web has become a common source for youth seeking health information. 1, 2 A recent study showed that 41 % of ado-lescents have changed their behavior in the past because of health information they found online, and almost half have contacted a health care provider as a result. 3 The Internet provides teens with a unique sense of anonym-ity when {{they are looking for}} information. The Internet also provides information on demand, at the time of need. These unique characteristics make it particularly compel-ling as a tool for communicating sensitive health infor-mation. 4 Because of the popularity and potential of the Internet, many private and federally funded programs and health departments have incorporated Web-based approaches into their pregnancy and HIV/STI (sexually transmitted infection) prevention efforts for adolescents. 5 These Web-based efforts have resulted in numerous and varied Web sites. This online content is currently understudied, underevaluated, and has at times been controversial. 6 - 9 Although a large amount of Web-based sexual health information now exists, finding relevant and responsibly written content for adolescent audiences can be difficult and time consuming. 10, 11 In this study, current sexual health Web sites targeted at adolescents are catalogued and coded for educational content, credibility, usability, and interactivity. <b>Internet</b> <b>addresses</b> (<b>URLs)</b> to Web sites are provided in order to guide pediatricians and other clinicians when referring adolescents and families to online sexual health resources...|$|R

40|$|This seminar {{is another}} {{excellent}} opportunity for {{those involved in}} preventing chemical weapons production and use to {{learn from each other}} about how the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) can become a foundation of arms control in Africa and around the world. The author is grateful to the staff of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) for inviting him to address this distinguished seminar. The views expressed in this paper {{are those of the authors}} alone, and do not represent the position of the government of the US nor or of any other institution. In 1993, as the process of CWC ratification was beginning, concerns arose that the complexity of integrating the treaty with national law would cause each nation to implement the Convention without regard to what other nations were doing, thereby causing inconsistencies among States Parties in how the Convention would be carried out. As a result the Manual for National Implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention was prepared and presented it to each national delegation at the December 1993 meeting of the Preparatory Commission in The Hague. During its preparation, the Manual was reviewed by the Committee of Legal Experts on National Implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, a group of distinguished international jurists, law professors, legally-trained diplomats, government officials, and Parliamentarians from every region of the world, including Mica. In February 1998, the second edition of the Manual was published in order to update it in light of developments since the CWC entered into force on 29 April 1997. The second edition 1998 clarified the national implementation options to reflect post-entry-into-force thinking, added extensive references to national implementing measures that had been enacted by various States Parties, and included a prototype national implementing statute developed by the authors to provide a starting point for those whose national implementing measures were still under development. Last month, the Web Edition of the Manual was completed. It's <b>internet</b> <b>address,</b> or <b>URL,</b> is [URL]...|$|R

As a result, the author's colleagues and the author prepared the Manual for National Implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and presented it to each national delegation at the December 1993 meeting of the Preparatory Commission in The Hague. During its preparation, the Committee of CWC Legal Experts, a group of distinguished international jurists, law professors, legally-trained diplomats, government officials, and Parliamentarians from every region of the world, including Central Europe, reviewed the Manual. In February 1998, they finished the second edition of the Manual in order to update it in light of developments since the CWC entered into force on 29 April 1997. The Manual tries to increase understanding of the Convention by identifying its obligations and suggesting methods of meeting them. Education about CWC obligations and available alternatives to comply with these requirements can facilitate national response that are consistent among States Parties. Thus, the Manual offers options that can strengthen international realization of the Convention's goals if States Parties act compatibly in implementing them. Equally important, it is intended to build confidence that the legal issues raised by the Convention are finite and addressable. They are now nearing competition of an internet version of this document so that interested persons can access it electronically and can view the full text of all of the national implementing legislation it cites. The <b>internet</b> <b>address,</b> or <b>URL,</b> for the internet version of the Manual is [URL] //www. cwc. ard. gov. This paper draws from the Manual. It comparatively addresses approximately thirty implementing issues, showing how various States Parties have enacted measures that are responsive to CWC obligations. It is intended to highlight the issues that States Parties must address and to identify trends among States Parties that might be useful to States that have not yet made crucial decisions as to how to resolve key matters. At various points in the text, country names are listed in parenthesis to identify pieces of national legislation that demonstrate the point in the text. It should not be inferred that nations not listed have not addressed the point or have taken a different position. In some cases, a nation's position is explained in somewhat more depth to give specific detail to an assertion in the text. Attached to this paper is a chart which illustrates how States Parties in the Central European region as well as the United States respond to the issues raised. Obviously, in preparing such a chart, many subtle provisions in national legislation must be simplified. The point of the chart is to portray, on a few pages, the major trends of legislation...|$|R
