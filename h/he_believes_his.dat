500|$|This {{focus on}} {{accuracy}} {{was a challenge}} for Staten, as <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>his</b> audience is highly intelligent, willing, and able to report flaws; fellow Bungie employees cross-referenced his drafts with the [...] "Halo Story Bible" [...] to ensure canonical agreement. One example of fans taking Staten to task over the novel occurred soon after the novel's cover was revealed in July 2007. The cover depicts the protagonist, Sergeant Avery Johnson holding a weapon known as the Battle Rifle. As the weapon was first introduced in the video game Halo 2 and the events of Contact Harvest take place decades before the game, fans were quick to say that Staten had made a mistake. Staten later pointed out he had good reasons for including the offending weapon in the book, and justified the inclusion by stating that the weapon is a prototypical form of the version players use in the game.|$|E
500|$|Head of Programmes Wales at the BBC, Aneirin Talfan Davies, who {{commissioned}} {{several of}} Thomas's early radio talks, {{believed that the}} poet's [...] "whole attitude {{is that of the}} medieval bards." [...] Kenneth O. Morgan counter-argues that it is a 'difficult enterprise' to find traces of cynghanedd (consonant harmony) or cerdd dafod (tongue-craft) in Thomas's poetry. Instead <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>his</b> work, especially his earlier more autobiographical poems, are rooted in a changing country which echoes the Welshness of the past and the Anglicisation of the new industrial nation: [...] "rural and urban, chapel-going and profane, Welsh and English, Unforgiving and deeply compassionate." [...] Fellow poet and critic Glyn Jones believed that any traces of cynghanedd in Thomas's work were accidental, although he felt Thomas consciously employed one element of Welsh metrics; that of counting syllables per line instead of feet. Constantine Fitzgibbon, Thomas's first in-depth biographer, wrote [...] "No major English poet has ever been as Welsh as Dylan".|$|E
500|$|Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{is missing}} Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), a former NBC page {{who was fired}} in the {{previous}} episode, [...] "I Do Do".

At the end of the credits, Kenneth admits to himself that he lied to Tracy and that he misses everyone at TGS. [...] Kenneth then starts hallucinating Tracy.|$|E

Later, while giving blood himself, he asks the hospital employee, [...] "How do I know it's not going to go into a person who will later come back to kill me?" [...] The second clip was two minutes of extended footage from the singles party. Meredith talks about her husband leaving her for a garbage-woman whom her kids now consider their real mother instead of herself, and Dwight said <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>his</b> soulmate, [...] "probably died 700 years ago in feudal Japan after having impersonated a samurai, {{or at the very least}} she lives somewhere outside the Scranton Wilkes-Barre corridor."

500|$|Writers Glen Morgan and James Wong {{developed}} the episode specially for Kristen Cloke, both for her experience as {{the protagonist of}} their series , to translate Morgan's feelings as his friendship with Cloke became an emotional relationship, and for showcasing her acting. Morgan stated, [...] "I knew she {{did a lot of}} characters and voices, so I wanted to incorporate that ... I wanted to write something for her that challenged her". Cloke did research on multiple personality disorders before filming, and based the various personalities on people she knew. Morgan also stated that he [...] "wanted to write something for David Duchovny that challenged him." [...] When pitching the idea to director Rob Bowman, the writers stated they wanted [...] "this episode to feel like the part in Ken Burns' Civil War documentary where they read the Sullivan Ballou letter." [...] Michael Massee wanted his characterization of Ephesian to be [...] "normal looking" [...] and [...] "nondemonic", explaining, [...] "You have to believe that <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>his</b> own rap. When he speaks, he's just explaining that 'this is the way it is' – and that's when it gets very scary." [...] The name [...] "Vernon" [...] comes from cult leader David Koresh's real name, and [...] "Ephesian" [...] is taken from one of the books of the Bible.|$|E
