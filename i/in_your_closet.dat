It begins with a clean guitar intro similar to the main riff; an E minor chord on a guitar using the wah-wah pedal is then introduced, followed by heavy use of tom-tom drums. Distorted guitars then build up to the main riff, which starts 56 seconds into the song and utilizes variations of the E/B tritone. P. J. Howorth, in The Wah Wah Book, characterized the main riff as [...] "sinister". The song then follows a common structure, playing two iterations of a verse, a pre-chorus, and a chorus. On the chorus and pre-chorus, the song modulates one whole tone, up to F, and after the second chorus, Hammett plays a guitar solo with the main, pre-chorus, and chorus riffs in the background. Hammett makes use of the wah-wah pedal and {{a wide range of}} scales, including e minor pentatonic, B minor, F minor, E minor, and the E dorian mode. One of the final licks of the solo was inspired by the Heart song [...] "Magic Man" [...] as used in Ice-T's [...] "Personal". Just a few seconds before the solo ends, the breakdown starts, in which the clean drum intro starts, then the clean guitar intro when the last notes of Kirk's solo echo over it into the background, are heard together with Hetfield teaching a child the [...] "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep" [...] bedtime prayer and reciting a variation of the lullaby rhyme [...] "Hush Little Baby" [...] where he is heard saying [...] "Hush little baby don't say a word, and never mind that noise you heard. It's just the beasts under your bed, <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>closet,</b> in your head". After building again to a chorus, the song starts to fade out while the band plays the same riffs as the buildup intro in reverse order. Lyrically, the song is about [...] "nightmares and all that come with them", according to Chris True of Allmusic. The title is a reference to the sandman, a character from Western folklore who makes children sleep.|$|E
