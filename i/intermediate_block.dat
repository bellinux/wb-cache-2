2500|$|Mark Wilson Jones has {{attempted}} to explain the design adjustments carried out in relating the porch to the dome, arguing that the Pantheon's porch was originally designed for monolithic granite columns with shafts 50 Roman feet tall (weighing about 100 tons) and capitals 10 Roman feet tall in the Corinthian style. The taller porch would have hidden the second pediment visible on the <b>intermediate</b> <b>block.</b> Instead, after the intended columns failed to arrive, the builders made many awkward adjustments {{in order to use}} shafts 40 Roman feet tall and capitals eight Roman feet tall. This substitution was probably a result of logistical difficulties at some stage in the construction. The grey granite columns that were actually used in the Pantheon's pronaos were quarried in Egypt at Mons Claudianus in the eastern mountains. Each was [...] tall, [...] in diameter, and 60 tons in weight. These were dragged more than [...] from the quarry to the river on wooden sledges. They were floated by barge down the Nile River when the water level was high during the spring floods, and then transferred to vessels to cross the Mediterranean Sea to the Roman port of Ostia. There, they were transferred back onto barges and pulled up the Tiber River to Rome. After being unloaded near the Mausoleum of Augustus, the site of the Pantheon was still about 700 metres away. Thus, it was necessary to either drag them or to move them on rollers to the construction site.|$|E
2500|$|The form of Agrippa's Pantheon is debated. As {{a result}} of {{excavations}} in the late 19th century, archaeologist Rodolfo Lanciani concluded that Agrippa's Pantheon was oriented so that it faced South, {{in contrast with the}} current layout that faces North, and that it had a shortened T-shaped plan with the entrance {{at the base of the}} [...] "T". This description was widely accepted until the late 20th century. While more recent archaeological diggings have suggested that Agrippa's building might have had a circular form with a triangular porch, and it might have also faced North, much like the later rebuildings, Ziolkowski complains that their conclusions were based entirely on surmise; according to him, they did not find any new datable material, yet they attributed everything they found to the Agrippan phase, failing to account for the fact that Domitian, known for his enthusiasm for building and known to have restored the Pantheon after 80 AD, might well have been responsible for everything they found. Ziolkowski argues that Lanciani's initial assessment is still supported by all of the finds to date, including theirs; furthermore he expresses skepticism because the building they describe, [...] "a single building composed of a huge pronaos and a circular cella of the same diameter, linked by a relatively narrow and very short passage (much thinner than the current <b>intermediate</b> <b>block),</b> has no known parallels in classical architecture and would go against everything we know of Roman design principles in general and of Augustan architecture in particular." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this study, a novel {{positioning}} {{model of}} a double-CCD cameras calibration system, with an Alternate-Eight-Matrix (AEM) Look-Up-Table (LUT), was proposed. Two CCD cameras were fixed {{on both sides of}} a large scale screen to redeem Field Of View (FOV) problems. The first to the fourth AEMLUT were used to compute the corresponding positions of <b>intermediate</b> <b>blocks</b> on the screen captured by the right side camera. In these AEMLUT for the right side camera, the coordinate mapping data of the target in a specific space were stored in two matrixes, while the gray level threshold values of different position were stored in the others. Similarly, the fifth to the eighth AEMLUT were used to compute the corresponding positions of <b>intermediate</b> <b>blocks</b> on the screen captured by the left side camera. Experimental results showed that the problems of dead angles and non-uniform light fields were solved. In addition, rapid and precision positioning results can be obtained by the proposed method...|$|R
30|$|As {{observed}} {{from the}} complete and standard blocking filtration mechanisms, both mechanisms occurred simultaneously as expected with much better stability {{compared to what}} was experienced with the 1  kDa UF membrane. Complete and standard blocking started at 0.0055  L of filtered feed volume and persisted until the volume reached 0.036  L as observed from their linear plots. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>blocking</b> model, as observed from the plot, suggests that it occurred after the first 6.5  min and persisted until it reached 15  min of filtration time. The transition time for the <b>intermediate</b> <b>blocking</b> mechanism was observed to be longer compared with the 1  kDa UF membrane. This {{may be due to}} the fact that the 5  kDa UF membrane has a larger pore than the 1  kDa and more filtration time and volume will be required before the particulate matters contained in the feed can be accumulated (Bacchin et al. 2006; Iritani 2013; Said et al. 2015). The cake filtration fully started after the filtrate volume of 0.04  L as observed from the possible straight plot that could be attained at that range.|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: Preventive open carotid {{surgery is}} amainstay {{treatment}} for stenosis of internal carotid artery. Anesthesia management {{is crucial in}} these patients with many comorbidities. Both, general or regional anesthesia are the correct choice. The purpose of our trialwas to compare the hemodynamic stability of <b>intermediate</b> cervical plexus <b>block</b> relative to general anesthesia in ASA III and ASA IV patients. Materials and methods: Prospective study, approved by ethics committee, was conducted in the University hospital Zagreb from 2006 till 2010. Eighty nine high risk patients with carotid endarterectomy were enrolled. Thirty five patients were performed in the <b>intermediate</b> cervical <b>block</b> and fifty four in general anesthesia. From medical records, following data were collected – age, sex, ASA status. Mean arterial pressure was calculated. The change of mean arterial pressure during the operation for more than 20 % was considered as hemodynamic instability. Postoperative hospital stay was recorded. Results: Significantly higher hemodynamic stability {{is found in the}} group of patientswith <b>intermediate</b> cervical <b>block</b> (chi-square test= 27, 763, p< 0, 01). The median intensive care unit stay was 2, 47 days for general anesthesia group, compared to one day for intermediate cervical group. Conclusion: General anesthesia and <b>intermediate</b> cervical <b>block</b> provide effective anesthesia condition for carotid endarterectomy. According to the results of our trial, <b>intermediate</b> cervical <b>block</b> compared to general anesthesia is more hemodynamic stable, associated with shorter hospital stay...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: Regional {{anesthesia}} is {{the choice}} for patients undergoing preventive open carotid surgery. Recently <b>intermediate</b> cervical plexus <b>block</b> {{has been described as}} a reliable and safe anesthesia technique in comparison with superficial and deep cervical plexus block. The aim of our study was to assess the complications of <b>intermediate</b> cervical plexus <b>block</b> in high risk patients. Materials and Method: The study was performed in 29 ASA III and ASA IV patients with the <b>intermediate</b> cervical plexus <b>block</b> for carotid endarterectomy from January 2006 till November 2008 in the University Hospital Zagreb. The following data were collected: age, sex, ASA status and preoperative disease. Furthermore, intraoperative and postoperative complications associated with <b>intermediate</b> cervical plexus <b>block</b> and carotid endarterectomy were recorded. Results: Median age was 69 years (range, 46 – 82 years). One patient developed Horner’s syndrome, three patients developed transitory ischemic attack, one developed stroke intraoperatively and died, seven patients developed transitory hemodynamic instability, one was hypotensive in the postoperative period and required vasoactive support.

50|$|This {{led to a}} {{proposal}} for the MDR to extend from Wimbledon to Sutton, and to quadruple the Putney to Wimbledon section which was already suffering from congestion.

30|$|These results {{concur with}} {{previous}} studies (Boerlage et al. 2002; Schippers and Verdouw 1980; Yuan et al. 2002) that asserted {{that it is}} phenomenal for the complete and standard blocking mechanisms to occur {{at the start of}} a filtration because of the accumulation of particles tending towards the complete sealing of both smaller and larger pores of the membrane, progressively. After this, it is expected that the <b>intermediate</b> <b>blocking</b> takes control of the filtration mechanism for an extended period of time and serves as a transition phase between the previously occurred blocking mechanism (complete and standard) and cake layer stockpiling. This will continue until the establishment of a significant cake layer.|$|R
30|$|In principle, {{governing}} filtration {{models can}} facilitate {{the design of}} membrane processes than any experiment can, yet, experimentations are usually required for validation reasons (Peinemann et al. 2010). To properly control particulate fouling {{at the design stage}} as well as appropriately monitor it during a plant operation, methods utilised in evaluating the particulate content of feed-water in predicting membrane fouling are essential. Declining flux with time is a phenomenon generally used in describing membrane fouling. The complete <b>blocking,</b> standard <b>blocking,</b> <b>intermediate</b> <b>blocking</b> and cake filtration mechanisms were used in studying the filtration mechanism for each of the membranes. The revised Hermia’s blocking models were applied to arrive at the plots of the filtration mechanism.|$|R

The model is able to correlate experimental permeate flow rate data in the microfiltration of fermentation broths in laboratory- and pilot-scale units with an average root-mean-square (RMS) error of 4. 6 %. The experimental data are also compared against the critical-flux model of cross-flow microfiltration, which has average RMS errors of 6. 3, 5. 5 and 6. 1 % for the cases of cake filtration, <b>intermediate</b> <b>blocking</b> and complete blocking mechanisms, respectively...|$|R

An alternative system employs special long-section token systems; when long section working is to be instituted, all the short section tokens must be in their respective instruments; by switching to the long-section method, tokens for the long section can then be obtained in the ordinary way. Obviously all the long-section tokens must be restored before the normal working can be resumed.|$|E
30|$|The fouling {{phenomena}} of biotreated POME, {{which is a}} Newtonian fluid, with respect to three different MWCOs of ultrafiltration membranes have been analysed in this study to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms involved in fouling/flux decline. It was observed that the blocking index η decreased from 2 to 0 successively as the blocking phenomenon started from complete blocking (η =  2) until a much stable phase of cake filtration phenomenon (η =  0) featured. These consecutive steps of the fouling process were elucidated {{in terms of the}} successive or simultaneous presence of the four fouling stages of complete <b>blocking,</b> standard <b>blocking,</b> <b>intermediate</b> <b>blocking,</b> and cake filtration phenomena. It was observed that the cake filtration phenomena dominated all other fouling steps though not without the other three phenomenon contributing step-wisely or simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} of folding <b>intermediates</b> <b>blocked</b> by iodoacetate {{from the main}} toxin of Naja naja samarensis was monitored by FPLC and the populations were identified by amino acid analyses. We have determined conditions allowing for the highest yield in the populations with two blocked cysteines. The free cysteines remaining under these conditions were labeled with iodo[14 C]acetate and localized by peptide mapping {{in one of the}} products isolated by ion-exchange chromatography (NT 3 III). We have also investigated the effects on the native-like characteristics of such molecules of an incubation at equilibrium with a mixture of cysteine and cystine. We find that many different molecular populations are present during the folding process and that disulfide exchanges allow for the reconstitution of native-like products having open disulfides even under strongly denaturing conditions...|$|R
40|$|The folding pathway for a 150 -amino acid {{recombinant}} {{form of the}} dimeric cytokine human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) {{has been}} studied. All 14 cysteine residues in the biologically active homodimer are involved in disulfide linkages. The structural characteristics of folding <b>intermediates</b> <b>blocked</b> with iodoacetamide reveal a rapid formation of {{a small amount of}} a non-native dimeric intermediate species followed by a slow progression via both monomeric and dimeric intermediates to the native dimer. The transition from monomer to fully folded dimer is complete within 25 h at room temperature at pH 9. 0. The <b>blocked</b> <b>intermediates</b> are stable under conditions of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and thus represent various dimeric and folded monomeric species of the protein with different numbers of disulfide bridges. Peptide mapping and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed that a folded monomeric species of M-CSF contained three of the four native disulfide bridges, and this folded monomer also showed some biological activity in a cell-based assay. The results presented here strongly suggest that M-CSF can fold via two different pathways, one involving monomeric intermediates and another involving only dimeric intermediates...|$|R
50|$|In 1934 {{the signal}} box {{was closed and}} {{semaphore}} <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Block</b> Signals, controlled from Moreton and Hoylake boxes, were introduced, the only such signals on the Liverpool to West Kirby line.

30|$|Having {{considered}} the model plots, it was {{noticed that the}} usual complete and standard blocking models were the pioneering mechanisms in the filtration process as they both simultaneously occurred between 0.0055 and 0.036  L of filtered volume.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy surgery can be {{performed}} under regional anaesthesia alone or under general anaesthesia. However, there are several types of regional block available and reported complication rates after superficial cervical plexus blocks are significantly lower than deep blocks. It is not known if subcutaneous and <b>intermediate</b> <b>blocks</b> are equally effective, although anatomical {{evidence suggests that the}} latter (where the injectate diffuses below the deep cervical fascia) might provide superior quality of intraoperative anaesthesia. METHODS: Forty-four patients were randomized to receive either subcutaneous or <b>intermediate</b> cervical plexus <b>blocks</b> for carotid endarterectomy. The primary endpoint was supplemental lidocaine requirement during surgery. Secondary outcome measures included: total amount of fentanyl administered during surgery, recall of pain scores during surgery, complications, and patient and surgeon satisfaction. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference for median (range) lidocaine supplementation between the subcutaneous and intermediate groups 65 (20 - 170) mg vs. 85 (30 - 345) mg, respectively; P= 0. 31. There were no statistical differences in the secondary outcome measures and no major complications during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Intermediate and subcutaneous cervical plexus blocks are equally effective for carotid endarterectomy. This study adds to the body of evidence supporting the safe use of superficial blocks for this type of surgery...|$|R
