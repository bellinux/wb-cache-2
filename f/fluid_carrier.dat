In this contribution, a mathematical model is derived to describe the changes in water concentration in both a solid food matrix and a <b>fluid</b> <b>carrier</b> during drying. Finite different element method is used to solve the set of mass balance equations. A remarkable agreement between simulated and experimental data was obtained. Moreover, the simulated changes in water concentration in the solid and <b>fluid</b> <b>carrier</b> gave a coherent description of the process.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Propofol, {{a popular}} {{intravenous}} (iv) anaesthetic induction agent for brief cases or day surgery, {{is associated with}} smooth induction, pleasant sleep, rapid recovery and little postoperative nausea. A major disadvantage is pain {{at the site of}} injection. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the influence of simultaneous iv infusion of <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> on propofol-induced local pain. METHODS: Thirty patients, scheduled for ear-nose-throat or plastic surgery under general anaesthesia, were randomly allocated into two groups. Each patient had two 2 ml iv bolus injections of propofol given at two minutes' interval. In group I (n= 15) the first bolus injection was given with no iv <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> and the second one given with a 10 ml iv <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> infused over 10 s. Correspondingly, the patients in group II (n= 15) had their first injection with and their second one without the iv <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid.</b> Following each injection of propofol the patients were asked by a blinded investigator to score their pain on a 10 -point visual analogue scale, and to report the appearance, maximum and disappearance of pain. After the second assessment of pain, general anaesthesia was induced with more propofol. RESULTS: Pain intensity at the site of propofol injection was found not to be influenced by simultaneous iv infusion of <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid.</b> CONCLUSION: It seems, from the results obtained here, that simultaneous iv infusion of <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> has no particular effect on local pain following iv administration of propofol...|$|R

A variant of a hedonic cost model is proposed in which the output aggregator is expressed {{as a function of}} total output and of the percentage concentrations of its components. Dairy farmers have responded rationally to artificially low protein prices. Due to the cow's appetite limit, farmers operate in stage I of feed-to-milk production functions; yet protein's marginal cost rises sharply with protein output.

40|$|A {{numerical}} model for dilute, three-dimensional, turbulent, incompressible fluid-solid particle flows and {{its application to}} a demonstration problem are presented. An Eulerian description is used to model {{the flow of the}} <b>fluid</b> (<b>carrier)</b> phase, and the governing equations are solved using a control-volume finite element method (CVFEM). The motion of the solid (particulate) phase is simulated using a Lagrangian approach. An efficient algorithm is proposed for locating the particles in the finite element mesh. In the demonstration problem, which involves a particle-laden axisymmetric jet, a modified k-ε turbulence model is used to characterize the velocity and length scales of the turbulent flow of the fluid phase. The effect of turbulence on the particle trajectories is accounted for through a stochastic model. The effect of the particles on the fluid time-mean velocity and turbulence (two-way coupling) is also addressed. Comparisons between predictions and available experimental data for the demonstration problem are presented. Satisfactory agreement is obtained. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Magneto-rheological fluids {{represent}} one of {{the most}} recent technologies introduced in many industrial applications to design fast and reliable electro-mechanical devices. Such fluids, which consist of a dispersion of metallic particles in a <b>fluid</b> <b>carrier,</b> may drastically change their rheological properties when subjected to external magnetic fields with short response times and low power consumption. Up to date, the most common applications of MR fluids regard the integration in mechatronics applications mainly in civil and mechanical fields, where they are often used as active lubricants in rotary components such as bearings. However, no investigations can be found in literature on their tribological performances when applied in metal forming processes. The paper aims at investigating the tribological behaviour of magneto-rheological fluids when applied as lubricants in sheet metal forming processes. To this aim, a new experimental apparatus has been developed to test the friction coefficient at the interface between the tools and the metal sheet when different magnetic fields are applied. The stamping of AA alloys was taken as reference case to select the process parameters in terms of contact pressure, magnetic field and sliding speed...|$|E
40|$|Metal foams {{have gained}} {{popularity}} in the renewable energy industry due to their superior thermo-physical properties. In the present study, a coupled finite volume and discrete element numerical method is used to numerically investigate the mechanisms that govern particle-laden gas flows and particulate fouling in idealized metal foam air-cooled heat exchangers. This paper provides a systematic analysis of the foulant distribution and the pressure drop due to the metal foam structure {{and the presence of}} fouling. The idealized Weaire-Phelan metal foam geometry serves as a good approximation to a real metal foam geometry. The pressure drop and deposition fraction follows a linear relation for sandstone cases, whereas for the sawdust cases, the pressure drop is sensibly invariant with time although a noticeable increase in deposition fraction with time is realized. The foulant residence time in addition to the correlations between pressure drop, deposition fraction, and inlet velocity can be used to optimize metal foam heat exchanger designs. Optimum heat exchanger performance is achieved by keeping the same fiber thickness of 0. 17 mm at a high porosity at 97. 87 %. An increase in <b>fluid</b> <b>carrier</b> velocity promotes particle transport by means of particle interception thereby reducing the deposition fraction irrespective of foam geometry...|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} hydraulic transport of high concentration, wide size distribution suspensions in laminar flow. Such suspensions generally stratify in pipe flow. The coarse burden, made from the larger particles, is conveyed in a non-Newtonian, visco-plastic <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> made from the finer particles and conveying water. The rheological properties of the <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> only are required for the successful design of such systems, which use a two-layer mechanistic modelling approach. Experimental studies made in Australia and South Africa during the AMIRA P 599 projects have shown that surprisingly small particles will stratify under laminar flow conditions, but the exact size of the smallest particle {{to contribute to the}} coarse burden is unknown. Similarly, while the rheological behaviour of the <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> is dominated by the influence of the very smallest particles, larger particles also influence the carrier&# 039;s rheology and this upper bound is similarly unknown. Such limits cannot be theoretically ascertained as the interaction between the phases is rheologically complex. The variability of industrial suspensions makes the situation worse. Screening out of all the coarser particles, so that the rheology of the <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> only can be measured, is a possible approach. However, this is practically very difficult, especially for smaller particles in yield stress fluids. This paper introduces a practical technique for determining the rheology of the <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> only. This is obtained from a sample that has been only cursorily screened from the entire suspension...|$|R
40|$|The Joule heating {{effects on}} hydrodynamics are {{examined}} {{for the case}} of a non-Newtonian fluid flowing in a batch electrophoretic cell. The potential benefits of using non-Newtonian fluids in electrophoretic separations could lead, for example, to an increase in the efficiency of separations and to a better scale-up of the operation for the processing of large quantities on a pilot or even an industrial scale. The analysis conducted in this research is based on the formulation of simplified mathematical models that can capture the most relevant aspects of the physics of the free convection that takes place in a batch electrophoretic cell. The first aspect is associated with the <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> when no solute sample (of particles or macromolecules) is added to the device. This is, indeed, a <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> completely free of solute problem. This aspect of the research {{is referred to as the}} <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> problem. The second aspect involved in the investigation is the analysis of the mass transport (i. e., convective-diffusive) process associated with the motion of a solute sample added to the <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid.</b> This particular aspect of the research is referred to as the solute problem of the free-convection electrophoretic cell. The two problems are sequentially coupled and the solution of the <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> problem must be performed first in order to have the velocity profile to study the solute problem.

40|$|In this contribution, a {{mathematical}} model is built to predict the changes in water concentration in both a solid food matrix and a <b>fluid</b> <b>carrier</b> during supercritical carbon dioxide (SC–CO 2) drying. The mass balance equations of the model involve five dimensionless parameters: Peclet number modified Sherwood number, Fourier number, mass ratio and equilibrium constant. The differential equations were discretized using the finite explicit difference method. The resulting model was implemented and solved in Matlab/Simulink using an explicit Runge–Kutta solver. A very good agreement (ARD = 7. 2 %) between experimental data, obtained by an independent group, and the present model was observed. The axial dispersion diffusion coefficient seems not to {{play a significant role}} during the drying process. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the predictions are relatively more sensitive to the equilibrium constant and the mass ratio than to Peclet and modified Sherwood numbers. Furthermore, in the case of Peclet and modified Sherwood numbers, the sensitivity and the uncertainty of the output are function of the final moisture content. The present model could be used as an optimization tool for kinetic studies to investigate the effects of different operation conditions on the performance and design of the supercritical drying technology...|$|E
40|$|A microwave-induced, steam/Ar/O- 2, plasma "torch" was {{operated}} at {{atmospheric pressure}} {{to determine the}} feasibility of destroying volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of concern. The plasma process can be coupled with adsorbent technology by providing steam as the <b>fluid</b> <b>carrier</b> for desorbing the VOCs from an adsorbent. Hence, N- 2 can be excluded by using a relatively inexpensive carrier gas, and thermal formation of oxides of nitrogen (NO.) is avoided in the plasma. The objectives {{of the study were}} to evaluate the technical feasibility of destroying VOCs from gas streams by using a commercially available microwave plasma torch and to examine whether significant byproducts were produced. Trichloroethene (TCE) and toluene (TOL) were added as representative VOCs of interest to a flow that contained Ar as a carrier gas in addition to O- 2 and steam. The O- 2 was necessary to ensure that undesirable byproducts were not formed in the process. Microwave power applied at 500 - 600 W was found to be sufficient to achieve the destruction of the test compounds, down to the detection limits of the gas chromatograph that was used in the analysis. Samples of the postmicrowave gases were collected on sorbent tubes for the analysis of dioxins and other, byproducts. No hazardous byproducts were detected when sufficient O- 2 was added to the flow. The destruction efficiency at a fixed microwave power improved with the addition of steam to the flow that passed through the torch...|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} of semi-active (SA) structural control systems based on magnetorheological (MR) dampers in earthquake engineering {{is at the}} moment highly questionable {{due to lack of}} experimental information about the long term behavior of MR fluids and MR dampers. As a matter of a fact, MR fluids adopted in smart dampers are essentially made up of magnetizable particles suspended in a <b>fluid</b> <b>carrier.</b> The MR effect is then associated to the uniform distribution of such particles in the fluid. Due to gravity, magnetizable particles tend to settle down in time, making the damper not able to perform as expected. This phenomenon has little or no importance in applications where SA MR dampers are continuously excited. For instance, in smart car dampers, the almost continuous stroke activity shakes the fluid and counteract the settling effect. In earthquake applications, SA MR dampers could stay still for decades before starting to work and, therefore, particles settling could make the dampers useless at the very moment they are needed. In the present paper an experimental activity on SA MR dampers is presented. On a purposefully made testing apparatus, the SA MR dampers have been tested and fully characterized. The devices have been then stored on a shelf of the laboratory for about 5 years, after that one of the original test (harmonic cycles at imposed frequency and displacement amplitude) has been repeated. The comparison of the results may give an interesting insight on the long term behavior of SA MR dampers...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} the effect of Joule heating {{generation}} on the hydrodynamic profile and the solute transport found in electrophoretic devices is addressed in this article.

" The other one is related to the effect of Joule heating on the solute transport inside electrophoretic cells and it is referred to as "the solute problem". The hydrodynamic aspects were studied first to yield the velocity profiles required for analysis of the solute transport problem. The velocity profile obtained in this study is analytical and the results are valid for non-Newtonian <b>fluids</b> <b>carriers.</b> To this end, the power-law model was used to study the effect of the rheology of the material in conjunction with the effect of Joule heating generation inside batch electrophoretic devices. This aspect of the research was then effectively used to study the effect of Joule heating generation on the motion of solutes (such as macromolecules) under the influence of non-Newtonian carriers. This aspect of the study was performed using an area-averaging approach that yielded analytical results for the effective diffusivity of the device...|$|R

We screened 230 donors of diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds and identified 62 (27 %) whose nasal secretions were colonized by S. aureus. In 18 donors in whom the various regions of the nasal luminal surface were separately sampled, the predominant region of S. aureus colonization was the moist squamous epithelium on the septum adjacent to the nasal ostium. Nasal <b>fluid</b> from <b>carriers</b> was defective in killing endogenous S. aureus and nasal carrier isolates of S. aureus but not a laboratory S. aureus strain. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that S. aureus isolates incubated in nasal <b>fluid</b> from <b>carriers</b> for 2 h at 37 °C were less damaged than those incubated in noncarrier fluid and were coated with an electron-dense layer.
