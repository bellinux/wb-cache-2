Among the various issues that must be clarified {{as far as the}} safety of invisible orthodontics is concerned, {{there is a need to}} study their effects on sleep-time MMA. Indeed, from a technical viewpoint, aligners cannot be compared to any available device that has been studied so far. They are neither hard nor soft, since they are built with a low-thickness hard thermoplastic resin foil and represent a hybrid solution as far as the resiliency of the material is concerned. Besides, the thermoplastic foil does not allow a control of the thickness with respect to usual procedures to build <b>hard</b> <b>resin</b> appliances. Thus, their effects on sMMA are likely comparable to neither hard- nor soft-resin appliances.|$|E

30|$|When the eugenol-based sealer or {{temporary}} restorative {{materials were}} compared to resin-based material or even associated with them, no difference was found on microleakage. Some authors reported that the reduction on resin-dentin bond strength values after pretreatment with eugenol-containing materials {{is caused by the}} cement itself rather than eugenol, as remnants of temporary materials are not completely removed before adhesive application [42, 45]. It is well know that eugenol released from zinc oxide and eugenol (ZOE) based materials can penetrate dentin and interact with resin-based restorative materials suppressing the polymerization of polymers; in practice, eugenol in IRM reduces the mechanical properties of composite resin within a limited range, less than 100  mm from the interface [24]. Moreover, the less polymerized composite resin close to the interface generates a graded region and provides a smooth transition from <b>hard</b> <b>resin</b> to a soft ZOE base, which can improve stress distribution [24]. This may also be the reason why no difference was found in microleakage in this study.|$|E
40|$|We present {{measurements}} of the stress response of packings formed {{from a wide range}} of particle shapes. Besides spheres these include convex shapes such as the Platonic solids, truncated tetrahedra, and triangular bipyramids, as well as more complex, non-convex geometries such as hexapods with various arm lengths, dolos, and tetrahedral frames. All particles were 3 D-printed in <b>hard</b> <b>resin.</b> Well-defined initial packing states were established through preconditioning by cyclic loading under given confine-ment pressure. Starting from such initial states, stress-strain relationships for axial compression were obtained at four different confining pressures for each particle type. While confining pressure has the largest overall effect on the mechanical response, we find that particle shape controls the details of the stress-strain curves and can be used to tune packing stiffness and yielding. By correlating the experimentally measured values for the effective Young’s modulus under compression, yield stress and energy loss during cyclic loading, we identify trends among the various shapes that allow for designing a packing’s aggregate behavior...|$|E

MÉTODOS: Análise espectrofotométrica (espectrofotômetro modelo Humphrey Lens Analyzer LA 360) de 14 tipos de lentes oftálmicas incolores, confeccionadas em {{material}} orgânico de diferentes características. Cada tipo de lente foi representado por 20 exemplares, totalizando amostra de 280 lentes estudadas. Posteriormente procedeu-se a análise da curva de transmitância na faixa do espectro entre 290 e 700 nm. RESULTADOS: Em relação à radiação UVB, todas as lentes estudadas apresentaram transmitância de 0 a 1 %. Tiveram melhor desempenho (0 % de transmitância) : Trivex, Rugged Fashion Wear, AO Lite, <b>Hard</b> <b>Resin,</b> Sola Light 1. 56, MAR 1. 56, MAR CR 39, Stylis Crizal, Crizal, AirWear e Orma 15. Quanto à radiação UVA a transmitância oscilou de 1 a 18 %. Tiveram melhor desempenho (transmitância de 1 %) : Miolight anti-reflexo 1. 56, Trivex, Miolight Excellence, Rugged Fashion Wear, Sola Light, MAR 1. 56, Stylis Crizal e Air Wear. Nenhuma das lentes estudadas filtrou completamente a radiação UVA. Todas as lentes estudadas apresentaram transmitância superior a 95 % em relação ao espectro visível, havendo variação de 95 a 100 %. CONCLUSÕES: Todas as lentes estudadas apresentaram poder de filtração UVB de 99 a 100 %, UVA de 82 a 99 % e 95 a 100 % de transmitância da luz visível. A presença de tais filtros em lentes incolores amplia as possibilidades de prescrição deste recurso de proteção ocular. PURPOSE: To verify, by spectrophotometric study, the filtration {{power of}} A and B ultraviolet radiation and transmittance of visible light in colorless lenses of simple vision. METHODS: Spectrophotometric analysis (Model Humphrey Lens Analyzer LA 360 spectrophotometer) of 14 types of colorless ophthalmic lenses, made of organic material of different characteristics. Each lens type {{was represented by}} 20 copies, totaling a sample of 280 studied lenses. Later, {{the analysis of the}} transmittance curve in the spectrum range of 290 to 700 nm was performed. RESULTS: In relation to UVB radiation, all of the studied lenses presented transmittance from 0 to 1 %. The ones that had a better performance (0 % transmittance) were: Trivex, Rugged Fashion Wear, AO Lite, <b>Hard</b> <b>Resin,</b> Sola Light 1. 56, MAR 1. 56, MAR CR 39, Stylis Crizal, Crizal, Air Wear, Orma 15. As for UVA rays, the transmittance oscillated from 1 to 18 %. The ones that had a better performance (1 % transmittance) were: Miolight Anti Reflex 1. 56, Trivex, Miolight Excellence, Rugged Fashion Wear, Sola Light, MAR 1. 56, Stylis Crizal e Air Wear. None of studied lenses completely filtered UVA radiation. All of the studied lenses presented transmittance over 95 % in relation to the visible spectrum, with a variation from 95 to 100 %. CONCLUSIONS: The studied colorless lenses present a real capacity of filtration of UV radiation, especially regarding the UVB spectrum, which is favorable since this is the main portion of the spectrum related to ocular damages. All of the studied lenses presented UVB filtration power from 99 to 100 %, UVA from 82 to 99 % and 95 to 100 % of transmittance of visible light.

40|$|AbstractStatement of the problemThe {{effect of}} {{long-term}} water immersion on the shear bond strength between denture base resin and Triad visible-light-polymerized (VLP) direct <b>hard</b> reline <b>resin</b> is not known. PurposeThe {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the bonding characteristics of Triad VLP direct <b>hard</b> reline <b>resin</b> to heat-polymerized denture base resin subjected to long-term water immersion. Material and methodsNinety circular disks, 15 mm in diameter and 3 mm thick, of denture base resin were polymerized from a gypsum mold. Sixty specimens were subjected to water immersion and 30 were stored at ambient room temperature for 4 months. Thirty water-immersed specimens were dried with gauze (group 1), while the other 30 water-immersed specimens were dried with a hair dryer (group 2). The dry specimens (n= 30) represented the control group (group 3). All specimens were air abraded and painted with bonding agent before packing Triad VLP direct hard-reline resin. Specimens in each group were subjected to thermal cycling for 50, 000 cycles between 4 °C and 60 °C water baths with 1 -min dwell time at each temperature. The bond strength at which the bond failed under stress was recorded using a universal testing machine. One-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc comparison were applied to find significant differences between groups (α= 0. 05). ResultsSignificant differences in mean shear bond strength among the specimens existed because of variable water content in the denture base resin (P< 0. 05). Group 3 (dry) was higher than group 2 (desiccated), and the lowest was group 1 (saturated). ConclusionThe shear bond strength of Triad VLP direct <b>hard</b> reline <b>resin</b> to denture base resin depended on the water content in the denture base resin. The dry denture base resin demonstrated superior bond strength compared with the desiccated and water-saturated denture base resins...|$|R
40|$|The oral {{condition}} of edentulous patients today {{appears to be}} different from that of 30 years ago. In particular, the alveolar bone is highly resorbed, the oral mucosa is thiner, and saliva flow and oral perception are deteriorating. About 30 years ago, it was proposed that soft denture base materials should be tisue-friendly, and in fact, a lot of products of this kind have come to meet this requirement. On the other hand, in clinics, rigid materials have been used in most cases because they have given a high priority to durability. This seemed appropriate as long as the patients are in good health. However, as the number of aged persons has increased, more and more patients have become unable to cope with the hard material. Under these circumstances, soft lining materials are highly desirable. This was previously commonly denied because of the poor quality of soft materials, -but, modern soft lining materials have recently become much better, so when they are used appropriately, they are much more effective then in the past. It is confirmed that the application of soft liners having viscoelastic properties would lead to the most marked improvement in masticatory function. The improvement in masticatory function compared with <b>hard</b> <b>resin</b> was found to be in the order: acrylic resilient>silicone resilient>acrylic tisue conditioner. The results suggest that the use of materials with higher tan δ (loss tangent, viscoelastic property) and G’ (shear storage modulus, hardness) provides the most optimum masticatory function for the patients requiring the provision of soft liner on their dentures. Our goal is to tansfer the dentures into the museum during the 21 st century. Until we achieve this, soft liners will fill gap between denture and tissue, and between satisfaction and dissatisfaction with the dentures. Although, it is true that edentulism is decreasing, I still believe as well that the soft option is useful and can help to satisfy edentulous patients for 2 or 3 more decades...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{assessed}} the shear bond strength of 4 <b>hard</b> chairside reline <b>resins</b> (Kooliner, Tokuso Rebase Fast, Duraliner II, Ufi Gel Hard) to a rapid polymerizing denture base resin (QC- 20) processed using 2 polymerization cycles (A or B), {{before and after}} thermal cycling. Materials and Methods: Cylinders (3. 5 mm x 5. 0 mm) of the reline resins were bonded to cylinders of QC- 20 polymerized using cycle A (boiling water- 20 minutes) or B (boiling water; remove heat- 20 minutes; boiling water- 20 minutes). For each reline resin/polymerization cycle combination, 10 specimens (groups CAt e CBt) were thermally cycled (5 and 55 °C; dwell time 30 seconds; 2, 000 cycles); the other 10 were tested without thermal cycling (groups CAwt ad CBwt). Shear bond tests (0. 5 mm/min) were performed on the specimens and the failure mode was assessed. Data were analyzed by 3 -way ANOVA and Newman-Keuls post-hoc test (α=. 05). Results: QC- 20 resin demonstrated the lowest bond strengths among the reline materials (P<. 05) and mainly failed cohesively. Overall, the bond strength of the <b>hard</b> chairside reline <b>resins</b> were similar (10. 09 ± 1. 40 to 15. 17 ± 1. 73 MPa) {{and most of the}} failures were adhesive/cohesive (mixed mode). However, Ufi Gel Hard bonded to QC- 20 polymerized using cycle A and not thermally cycled showed the highest bond strength (P<. 001). When Tokuso Rebase Fast and Duraliner II were bonded to QC- 20 resin polymerized using cycle A, the bond strength was increased (P=. 043) after thermal cycling. Conclusions: QC- 20 displayed the lowest bond strength values in all groups. In general, the bond strengths of the <b>hard</b> chairside reline <b>resins</b> were comparable and not affected by polymerization cycle of QC- 20 resin and thermal cycling...|$|R

40|$|Context: Relining {{with heat}} cure denture base resin is {{time-consuming}} {{and the patient}} has to remain without dentures within this period. Recently, some autopolymerizing <b>resins</b> marketed as <b>hard</b> chairside reline systems with low exothermic heat allow the dentists to reline prosthesis directly in the mouth. However, {{the decision to use}} these materials must be based on physical properties such as dimensional accuracy that directly influences the accuracy of fit of the denture base. Aim: The aim was to compare the linear dimensional changes of two <b>hard</b> chairside reline <b>resins</b> with two laboratory heat cure resins at 3 times intervals after processing. Settings and Design: A stainless steel split mold (International Organization for Standardization 1567) was used for sample fabrication. Five measurements of the reference dimensions (AB and CD) were measured directly from the mold and the samples with a profile projector, and mean difference were calculated. Subjects and Methods: Forty samples were fabricated by incorporating the split mold into first pour of denture flasks and packing each of the chairside reline resins ("Kooliner" and "Ufi Gel Hard") and laboratory heat cure resins ("Dental Products of India Heat Cure" and "Trevalon"). The mean difference in dimensional change at 3 times intervals (0 h, 4 days and 2 months) were calculated and subjected to statistical analysis. Statistical Analysis Used: One-way ANOVA, RMANOVA and post hoc Tukey′s tests. Results: All resins showed different levels of significant shrinkage (P < 0. 001) after processing (T 0) ranging from − 0. 128 to − 0. 310 mm. After 4 days (T 1), there was significant shrinkage (P < 0. 001) ranging from − 0. 168 to − 0. 296 mm.
