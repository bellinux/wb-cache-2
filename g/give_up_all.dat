5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} through {{the leadership of the}} Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). The conflict became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes that they would be protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the white settlers. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey, which was becoming known as evil for American Indians.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid {{appears to}} have lived at Ripon, {{and for a time}} he acted as {{administrator}} of the see of Lindisfarne after Cuthbert's death in 687. In 691, the subdivision issue arose once more, along with quarrels with King Aldfrith over lands, and attempts were made to make Wilfrid either <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> his lands or to stay confined to Ripon. A proposal to turn Ripon into a bishopric was also a source of dispute. When no compromise was possible Wilfrid left Northumbria for Mercia, and Bosa was returned to York.|$|E

5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} around the Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet) that became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes {{that they would be}} protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the whites. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to only pay white traders half of what they owed, and to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> the white man's ways, including their clothing, whiskey, and guns. In 1810, Tecumseh, with about 400 armed warriors, traveled to Vincennes where he confronted Harrison and demanded that the Treaty of Fort Wayne be rescinded. Although Harrison refused, the war party left peacefully, but Tecumseh was angry and threatened retaliation. After the meeting Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region, hoping to create a confederation with which to battle the Americans.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the war the Arctic front remained stale. The German High Command did not regard it as an important theatre and therefore refrained from transferring the substantial reinforcements needed for a renewal of the offensive. The Finns likewise were not interested in continuing the offensive on their own as {{they did not want to}} antagonize the Western Allies further. In September 1944, following a series of devastating German defeats, the Finns sued for peace with the Soviet Union and had to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> their territorial conquests. The Germans subsequently retreated from Central Finland to Petsamo and Norway. In October 1944, the Red Army conducted the Petsamo-Kirkenes Operation and achieved a decisive victory over the German forces in the Arctic by completely expelling them from Finland.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, McClory {{announced}} plans to make another adaptation of the Thunderball story starring Timothy Dalton entitled Warhead 2000 AD, but the film was eventually scrapped. In 1997 Sony Pictures acquired McClory's rights for an undisclosed amount, and subsequently announced that it intended to make a series of Bond films, as the company also held the rights to Casino Royale. This move prompted a round of litigation from MGM, which was settled out-of-court, forcing Sony to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> claims on Bond; McClory still claimed he would proceed with another Bond film, and continued his case against MGM and Danjaq; On 27 August 2001 the court rejected McClory's suit. McClory died in 2006.|$|E

5|$|To recover lost ground, the PVA 45th Division {{commander}} Cui Jiangong {{attempted a}} sneak attack with three infantry companies by 7 pm. When flares broke the night cover, the attackers launched bayonet charges and hand-to-hand fighting ensued. The UN forces responded with heavy artillery fire, but the determined Chinese assault troops marched through both Chinese and UN artillery screens {{to reach the}} UN positions – a strange sight that made some American observers believe that the attackers were {{under the influence of}} drugs. The intense fighting prevented UN forces from receiving any resupply, and the UN defenders were forced to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> captured ground after running out of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Treaties {{with the}} Maasai in 1904 and 1911 {{forced them to}} <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> of their {{northern}} grazing lands on the Laikipia escarpment near Mount Kenya. Some {{of the people that}} lost land there were resettled in the Kitengela area. The Maasai's pastoral life did not create any conflicts with the wildlife. Today the Kitengela's former Maasai group-ranches have been privatized and some of the land has been sold to farmers. Houses, cultivated plots, schools, shops, and bars are found on the Kitengela plains. Some of the park's revenues have been used for community projects in order for the people living on the Kitengela to benefit from the presence of the national park. Many Maasai landowners have formed the Kitengela Landowners Association, which works with the Kenyan Wildlife Service to both protect the wildlife and find benefits for the locals.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the {{following}} day, the US forces attempted to retake the lost positions {{in order to}} restore the integrity of their line. Fighting raged throughout the day into the early afternoon, by which time they had successfully recaptured several of the pillboxes, supported by mortar fire. In the evening, the Americans used indirect fire and searchlights to harass the Japanese, but by early morning, just before dawn, they struck again, and captured another pillbox. As morning progressed, the US commander requested tank support and four tanks from the 754th Tank Battalion were dispatched. In the meantime, minor counterattacks succeeded in regaining part of the line; by mid-morning the tanks joined the fighting and several more positions were retaken by the US troops in several attacks before and after lunch. Having run out of ammunition and running low on fuel, {{the first group of}} tanks was withdrawn and replaced with a fresh platoon of tanks with which the attack was resumed in the mid-afternoon. Fighting continued throughout the day until 7:30pm when the Japanese retired from the position for the evening, having been forced to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> of their earlier gains by a determined American counterattack.|$|E

In addition, from seasons seven through nine, these teams would also be forced to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> their bags and possessions therein, leaving them with only the clothes on their backs and the fanny pack teams use to carry their passports and Race documentation; this latter penalty caused many teams, thinking themselves to be in last place, to wear as much clothing as possible before checking in.|$|E
25|$|While King Henry III of England had {{accepted}} Dafydd's claim to rule Gwynedd, {{he was not}} disposed {{to allow him to}} retain his father's conquests outside Gwynedd. In 1241 the King invaded Gwynedd, and Dafydd was forced to submit in late August. Under the terms of the Treaty of Gwerneigron, he had to <b>give</b> <b>up</b> <b>all</b> his lands outside Gwynedd, and also to hand over to the King his half brother Gruffudd whom he had been keeping a prisoner. Henry thereby gained {{what could have been a}} useful weapon against Dafydd, with the possibility of setting Gruffudd up as a rival to Dafydd in Gwynedd, but Gruffudd died trying to escape from the Tower of London by climbing down a knotted sheet, and fell to his death in March 1244.|$|E
