40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{understanding}} the seismic response of geosynthetic reinforced retaining walls through shaking table tests on models of <b>modular</b> <b>block</b> and rigid faced reinforced retaining walls. Reduced-scale models of retaining walls reinforced with geogrid layers were constructed in a laminar box {{mounted on a}} uniaxial shaking table and subjected to various levels of sinusoidal base shaking. Models were instrumented with ultrasonic displacement sensors, earth pressure sensors and accelerometers. Effects of backfill density, number of reinforcement layers and reinforcement type {{on the performance of}} rigid faced and <b>modular</b> <b>block</b> walls were studied through different series of model tests. Performances of the walls were assessed in terms of face deformations, crest settlement and acceleration amplification at different elevations and compared. <b>Modular</b> <b>block</b> walls performed better than the rigid faced walls for the same level of base shaking because of the additional support derived by stacking the blocks with an offset. Type and quantity of reinforcement has significant effect on the seismic performance of both the types of walls. Displacements are more sensitive to relative density of the backfill and decrease with increasing relative density, the effect being more pronounced in case of unreinforced walls compared to the reinforced ones. Acceleration amplifications are not affected by the wall facing and inclusion of reinforcement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Paper reviews recent {{research}} on the analysis, design and construction of geosynthetic reinforced soil retaining walls that use dry-stacked modular concrete units as the facing system (geosynthetic reinforced segmental retaining walls). These systems have gained wide popularity in North America for reasons of performance, aesthetics, cost and expediency of construction.

Some consequences of the extension of limit-equilibrium (pseudo-static) methods to the stability of segmental retaining wall structures are reviewed. Design methodologies, construction and specification recommendations described in this paper for routine structures have been recently adopted by the National Concrete Masonry Association (NCMA). ...|$|R

To enhance the reliability, {{multiple}} bus sets and spare nodes are dynamically inserted to construct <b>modular</b> <b>blocks.</b> Two reconfiguration schemes are associated, and can eliminate the spare substitution domino effect. Simulations show that both schemes provide for increase in reliability over the interstitial redundancy scheme[11] and the multi-level fault tolerance mesh(MFTM) [6], {{at the same}} redundant spare ratio. Especially, with global reconfiguration, the reliability improvement ratio per spare (RIPS) can be at least twice of that of the MFTM scheme. Furthermore, the lower port complexity in spare nodes as compared to those in both of the aforementioned schemes, and versatility in reconfiguration capability are two additional merits of our proposed architecture. ...|$|R
