5000|$|Movements {{of price}} indexes from one month to another usually should be {{expressed}} as percent changes, {{rather than as}} changes in index points, because the latter {{are affected by the}} level of the index in relation to its base period, while the former are not. Each index measures price changes from a reference period defined to equal 100.0. Currently, some PPIs have an <b>index</b> <b>base</b> set at 1982 = 100, while the remainder have an <b>index</b> <b>base</b> that corresponds with the month prior to the month that the index was introduced. BLS measures price change in relation to that figure. An index level of 110, for example, means there has been a 10-percent increase in prices since the base period; similarly, an index level of 90 indicates a 10-percent decrease in prices.|$|E

Using Spanish data, the size of the Laspeyres bias is estimated at - 0. 061 % per year, during 1992 - 1998.
