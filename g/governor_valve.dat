50|$|Frederick A. Sabbaton (1830-1894), was a {{specialist}} {{in the construction of}} gas works, and was the superintendent of the Troy Gas Light Company, from 1862 to 1890. Sabbaton worked extensively in New York State, and came from a family of engineers. His father, Paul A. Sabbation, was a close friend of Robert Fulton, prepared plans and specifications for The Clermont. Frederick Sabbaton's two brothers, and two sons were all employed as gas engineers. Sabboton supervised, constructed, and owned gas works in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and throughout New York State. He was also involved in the manufacturing of aniline dye, made from coal tar, and designed a gas <b>governor</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 4HP22 {{transmission}} can be rendered undriveable when held on P or N setting and too high engine rotation speed is applied for too long, for instance during emissions testing. Examples of situations {{that could lead}} to transmission failure include warming up the catalytic converter on petrol engine-powered vehicle with too high RPM, or while measuring amount of smoke on diesel engine-powered vehicle and keeping the throttle full for too long time.The correct procedure would be to stop the engine for at least 90 seconds, do the test (without selecting again D or R, this means without re-pressurizing the gearbox) for no longer than a minute, and if the procedure must be repeated, stop again for at least 90 seconds and repeat.Another issue is the <b>governor</b> <b>valve</b> sticking, which can be caused by contamination. i.e. clutch plates or other parts disintegrating. The fine debris finds its way past the filter and tends to accumulate in the governor, causing it to stick. A temporary solution is to remove and clean the governor. The problem will often recur as debris from damaged parts continues to build up in the governor. If the problem continues after cleaning the governor then it may be necessary it replace the autobox.Usual symptoms are failing to shift after 1st gear while the gearbox is still cold, and then failing to kickdown to 1st while at a stop. The governor is located {{at the end of the}} gearbox and usually it starts to work again after a cleanup.|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 99 - 108 This paper {{describes}} two {{steam turbine}} <b>governor</b> <b>valve</b> {{failures in the}} same installation, the troubleshooting that determined the root cause, and the new valve designed to prevent similar failures. The original <b>governor</b> <b>valve</b> design had been used successfully {{for many years in}} large multistage, multivalve steam turbines, but apparently was not reliable at the high steam pressures employed today. Mechanical analyses, flow analyses, and testing showed that the failures were caused by flow-induced instability in the valve. Candidate valves with more stable flow fields were designed and tested. The final design combined features of two other, more typical designs, and showed good flow stability throughout the lift range. This new ?hybrid? valve has since been applied successfully in other turbines...|$|E

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of the governor droop and dead-band in dynamic models helps to reproduce the measured frequency response accurately and is a key aspect of model validation. Often, accurate and detailed turbine-governor information are not available for various units in an area control centre. The uncertainty in the droop also arise from the nonlinearity due to the <b>governor</b> <b>valves.</b> The droop and deadband are required to tune the secondary frequency bias factors, and to determine the primary frequency reserve. Earlier research on droop estimation did not adequately {{take into account the}} effect of dead-band and other nonlinearities. In this paper, unscented Kalman filter is used in conjunction with continuously available measurements to estimate the governor droop and the dead-band width. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through simulation...|$|R

The received data was for a boiler feed pump turbine and consisted of peak-to-peak vibration and <b>governor</b> <b>valve</b> position values. Boiler feed pumps are significant and expensive power plant components and their failures may lead to serious financial and safety consequences, therefore an alarm system signalling potential abnormalities would reduce those risks.

40|$|Abstract—Most of the {{industrial}} processes are multivariable in nature. Designing controller for the Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) process is difficult because {{of the changes in}} process dynamics and interaction between process variables. The objective of the current study presented in this paper is to design a multivariable Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) Controller for a sample controlled hydropower system that comprises a hydraulic turbine driving a synchronous generator which is connected to an infinite bus via a step-up transformer and a transmission line. From the system point of view, a sample controlled hydropower system can be modelled as a two-input-two-output system, where the inputs are the exciter input voltage Ue and <b>governor</b> <b>valve</b> position Ug and the outputs are the active power Pt and the terminal voltage Vt. The validity and robustness of the proposed system is tested for reference tracking and disturbance rejection behaviour using simulation. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control methodology...|$|E

50|$|The {{single shaft}} five {{cylinder}} impulse-reaction turbine has a double flow arrangement for the I.P. cylinders {{as well as}} for the L.P. cylinders. There are double casings on H.P., I.P., and L.P. cylinders, and the last stages of the L.P. are fitted with 914.4 mm (36 in) blades. Stop <b>valves</b> and <b>governor</b> <b>valves</b> are situated at the inlet to the H.P. strainers and I.P. turbine. There are four 228.6 mm (9 in) bore main steam pipes, and four 431.8 mm (17 in) bore pipes on both the hot and cold reheat circuits to the turbine. In view of the size and increased volume of pipework compared to earlier designs, special attention was paid to mounting the valve chests as close to the machine as possible to reduce the stored energy effect of overspeed. For the H.P. valves this is done without actually mounting the valves on the cylinder, thus avoiding complication of the H.P. casing.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe crack repair {{technique}} by “crack grinding”, {{due to its}} efficiency, {{has been}} widely used to extend the service life of the cracked structural components. The “crack grinding” technique is carried out by removing the materials which contains the crack. So it is of great importance to {{study the effects of}} this repair technique. In this paper, the finite element method is used to analyse the behavior of repaired cracks in mode I by computing the stress-intensity factors at the crack tip. 3 D numerical simulation was carried out to model the steam <b>governor</b> <b>valve</b> in a coal-fired thermal power plant with a semi-elliptic crack. Since no extra auxiliary solutions are required for the computation, the proposed method appears to be visual and can be used for evaluation of the associated stress-intensity factors. The plot of the stress-intensity factors according to the crack length in mode I, shows that the stress-intensity factor exhibits an asymptotic behavior as the crack length increases. It's to be noted that a transition zone allows connecting the refined specific crack tip mesh to the global structural discretization. So this technique can be used for complex industrial structures...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 89 The boiler {{feedwater}} {{system in}} a world scale ethylene plant utilized horizontal multistage barrel case pumps and single stage impulse type steam turbine drivers with mechanical governors. As part of a major debottlenecking project, they were rerated to provide more flow. The entire pump inner case assemblies (including rotor and inner casing) were replaced with higher capacity elements. The steam turbines had new governor valves and nozzle rings installed to produce more power. The control scheme was modernized with an electronic governor that adjusted the pump speed to maintain a constant header pressure. The new equipment was installed in September 1994, nothing went well. The pump experienced high blade pass frequency vibrations. The solution required unique hydraulic modifications and inboard bearing bracket stiffening to eliminate a resonance. The turbines tripped mysteriously and broke <b>governor</b> <b>valve</b> stems. The cause was a valve resonance problem that were teething problems with the electronic governor control system that took time to sort out. These problems became very high profile when the newly rerated boiler feedwater pumps tripped and caused a total plant shutdown resulting in a 14 hr flare. Not only was there a major financial impact from lost production, it also prompted the ministry of the Environment to initiate {{a review of the}} company?s entire flaring history. Although it took a difficult year of effort, the pumps and turbines are now operating satisfactorily. The problems discovered are discussed, along with the analysis performed and the solutions implemented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study {{introduces}} a condition diagnosis technique for a turbine governor system. The governor system {{is an important}} control system to handle turbine speed in a nuclear power plant. The turbine governor system includes turbine valves and stop valves which have their own functions in the system. Because a turbine governor system is operated by high oil pressure, {{it is very difficult}} to maintain under stable operating conditions. Turbine valves supply oil pressure to the governor system for proper operation. Using the pressure variation of turbine and <b>governor</b> <b>valves,</b> operating conditions of the turbine governor control system are detected and identified. To achieve automatic detection of valve status, time-based and frequency-based analysis is employed. In this study, a new approach, wavelet decomposition, was used to extract specific features from the pressure signals of the <b>governor</b> and stop <b>valves.</b> The extracted features, which represent the operating conditions of the turbine governor system, include important information to control and diagnose the valves. After extracting the specific features, decision rules were used to classify the valve conditions. The rules were generated by a decision tree algorithm (a typical simple method for data-based rule generation). The results given by the wavelet-based analysis were compared to detection results using time- and frequency-based approaches. Compared with the several related studies, the wavelet transform-based analysis, the proposed in this study has the advantage of easier application without auxiliary features...|$|R

50|$|Because the DIRAVI {{system is}} much more {{sensitive}} than conventional systems, {{something must be done}} to prevent the driver over-controlling at high speeds. This is the job of the heart shaped centring cam inside the unit. A pressure loaded piston with a roller on the end runs against the edge of this cam. This pressure comes from a centrifugal <b>governor</b> proportioning <b>valve</b> driven from the gearbox (on manual gearboxes - on automatic gearboxes the gearbox's internal governor pressure controls the centring pressure). At low speeds, the centring piston pressure is 290 psig, to provide a light degree of self centring when parking etc. Proportionally the self centring pressure rises to a maximum of about 800 psig. at 80 km/h, at which self centring forces become a maximum, stiffening the steering but not excessively so.|$|R
50|$|The {{control of}} a turbine with a {{governor}} is essential, as turbines need to be run up slowly to prevent damage and some applications (such as the generation of alternating current electricity) require precise speed control. Uncontrolled acceleration of the turbine rotor can lead to an overspeed trip, which causes the <b>governor</b> and throttle <b>valves</b> that control the flow of steam to the turbine to close. If these valves fail then the turbine may continue accelerating until it breaks apart, often catastrophically. Turbines are expensive to make, requiring precision manufacture and special quality materials.|$|R

The period of review for this report was from January 1974 through December 1990 for licensee event reports (LERS) and January 1985 through December 1990 for Nuclear Plant Reliability Data System (NPRDS) failure data. This study confirmed the continuing validity of conclusions of earlier studies by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and by the US nuclear industry that the most significant factors in failures of turbine-driven standby pumps have been the failures of the turbine-drivers and their controls. Inadequate maintenance and the use of inappropriate vendor technical information were identified as significant factors which caused recurring failures...|$|R
