40|$|The {{significance}} of biodiversity and ecosystem services are gradually recognized by human as an approach towards sustainability, {{so it is}} important to understand relationships and congruence between them to support conservation planning, especially in the <b>hotspot</b> <b>areas</b> with a prominent role in conservation. However, the management of most conservation hotspots mainly focused on biodiversity, and rarely concerned with ecosystem services. With the aim of proposing criteria for conservation strategies that contribute to the optimization of biodiversity and ecosystem services, in this study, a Geographic Information System (GIS) -based approach was designed to estimate and map the biodiversity and ecosystem services in Chongqing Municipality of China. Furthermore, the distributions of <b>hotspot</b> <b>areas</b> for biodiversity and ecosystem services were mapped based on the relationship between cumulative ecosystem services and areas. Finally the statistical analysis was processed focused on specific conservation objectives. The results showed that <b>hotspot</b> <b>areas</b> can conserve the most biodiversity but with the least ecosystem services under the conservation plans target to biodiversity conservation. In contrast, depending on the ecosystem services of interest, <b>hotspot</b> <b>areas</b> can conserve the largest ecosystem services but with the least biodiversity. By integrating biodiversity and ecosystem services into conservation plan, we found that the conservation and regeneration of these small areas, would contribute to a conservation of 44 % of the biodiversity hotspot and 14 %- 42 % of the ecosystem services hotspot. Moreover, the current nature reserve selection was not maximize the biodiversity and ecosystem services compared to integration strategy, indicating that <b>hotspot</b> <b>areas</b> conservation and selection is vital for optimization protection of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and has practical significance for natural resources and ecosystem management...|$|R

Taxi trajectory data contain abundant information about urban functions and citizen activities, and extracting interesting city hotspots from them can be of importance in urban planning, traffic command, public travel services etc. To detect city hotspots and discover a variety of changing patterns among them, we introduce a data field-based cluster analysis technique to the pick-up and drop-off points of taxi trajectory data and improve the method by introducing the time weight, which has been normalized to estimate the potential value in data field. Thus, {{in the light of}} the new potential function in data field, short distance and short time difference play a powerful role. So the region full of trajectory points, which is regarded as <b>hotspots</b> <b>area,</b> has a higher potential value, while the region with thin trajectory points has a lower potential value.

As of 2010, Texas has the fourth highest occurrence of new diagnoses of HIV/AIDS and TB. [31] The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) has identified HIV infected persons as a high risk population for TB in Harris County. [29] In order to explore this relationship further, GIS was utilized to identify spatial trends. ^ The specific aims were to map TB and HIV new diagnoses rates and spatially identify hotspots and high value clusters at the census tract level. The potential association between HIV and TB was analyzed using spatial autocorrelation and linear regression analysis.

A sorbent-based sampling method, successfully developed to collect a wide-range of VOC, was used. The analysis was performed by automatic thermal desorption coupled with capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry detector. The presented methodology allows the evaluation of VMS together {{with a wide range}} of other VOC, increasing the number of compounds that can be determined in outdoor air quality assessment of urban areas. This aspect is especially relevant as a restriction of several VMS (D 4 and D 5) in consumer products has been made by the European Chemicals Agency and US EPA is evaluating to include D 4 in the Toxic Substances Control Act, regarding the concern of the possible effects of these compounds in human health and the environment. SVMS concentrations (L 2 -L 5, D 3 -D 6 and trimethylsilanol) varied between 0. 3 ± 0. 2 µg m- 3 and 18 ± 12 µg m- 3, determined in a <b>hotspot</b> <b>area.</b> Observed VMS concentrations were generally of the same order of magnitude than the previously determined in Barcelona, Chicago and Zurich urban areas, but higher than the published from suburban sites and Arctic locations.
