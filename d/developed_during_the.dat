5|$|Another of {{the early}} subwoofers was <b>developed</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, the former {{president}} of the Miller & Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel's business partner, Jonas Miller, who owned a high-end audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store's high-end electrostatic speakers had complained about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered woofer that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the electrostatic speakers to convey. Infinity's full range electrostatic speaker system that was <b>developed</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 1960s also used a woofer to cover the lower frequency range that its electrostatic arrays did not handle adequately.|$|E

5|$|Although {{influenced}} by Matisse, the Oriental art that Jolin discovered at Musée Guimet {{was even more}} important to his style.

Q*bert appeared in Disney's computer-animated film Wreck-It Ralph under license from Sony, and later appeared in Columbia's live-action film Pixels in 2015.|$|E

40|$|The large {{epidemiological}} studies demonstrated that atrial fibrillation is correlated with high mortality and adverse events {{in patients with}} acute myocardial infarction. The {{aim of this study}} was to determinate predictors of atrial fibrillation <b>develop</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> hospital period in patients with acute myocardial infarction as well as short- and long-term mortality depending on the atrial fibrillation presentation. The 600 patients with an acute myocardial infarction were included in the study and follow-up 84 months. Atrial fibrillation <b>develops</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> hospital period was registered in 48 patients (8 %). After adjustment by logistic regression model the strongest predictor of atrial fibrillation <b>develop</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> hospital period was older age, particularly more than 70 years (odds ratio 2. 37, CI 1. 23 - 4. 58, p= 0. 010), followed by increased of Body Mass Index (odds ratio 1. 17, CI 1. 04 - 1. 33, p= 0. 012), enlarged diameter of left atrium (LA) (odds ratio 1, 18, CI 1, 03 - 1, 33, p= 0, 015) presentation of mitral regurgitation (odds ratio 3. 56, CI 1. 25 - 10. 32, p= 0. 018) and B-type natriuretic peptide (odds ratio 2. 12, CI 1. 24 - 3. 33, p= 0. 048).

5|$|Several {{clusters}} of thunderstorms <b>developed</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> morning from eastern Nebraska across Iowa into Illinois, taking place along a warm front.

50|$|Since the 2000 Pacific typhoon season, the Tropical Storm Risk Consortium (TSR) of the University College of London {{have issued}} {{forecasts}} of activity for each upcoming typhoon season.

In its March forecast TSR predicted that the season would see activity close to the average with 26 tropical storms, 16 typhoons and seven intense typhoons <b>developing</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> season. In its May forecast, while lowering their initial prediction for the amount of tropical storms and typhoons, TSR continued to predict that the season would see activity close to the average, with 24 tropical storms, 15 typhoons and nine intense typhoons <b>developing</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> season. In its July forecast TSR significantly lowered their forecast and reported that they now expected activity to be 20% below average, with 23 tropical storms 14 typhoons and seven intense typhoons <b>developing</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> season. In its August forecast TSR predicted that activity would be 25% - 30% below average with 23 tropical storms, 13 typhoons and six intense typhoons <b>developing</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> season.
