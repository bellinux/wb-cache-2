50|$|Most {{industrial}} crystallizers {{are of the}} evaporative type, such as {{the very}} large sodium chloride and sucrose units, whose production {{accounts for more than}} 50% of the total world production of crystals. The most common type is the forced circulation (FC) model (see evaporator). A pumping device (a pump or an axial <b>flow</b> <b>mixer)</b> keeps the crystal slurry in homogeneous suspension throughout the tank, including the exchange surfaces; by controlling pump flow, control of the contact time of the crystal mass with the supersaturated solution is achieved, together with reasonable velocities at the exchange surfaces. The Oslo, mentioned above, is a refining of the evaporative forced circulation crystallizer, now equipped with a large crystals settling zone to increase the retention time (usually low in the FC) and to roughly separate heavy slurry zones from clear liquid. Evaporative crystallizers tend to yield larger average crystal size and narrows the crystal size distribution curve.|$|E
5000|$|Whichever {{the form}} of the crystallizer, to achieve an {{effective}} process control it is important to control the retention time and the crystal mass, to obtain the optimum conditions in terms of crystal specific surface and the fastest possible growth. This is achieved by a separation - to put it simply - of the crystals from the liquid mass, in order to manage the two flows in a different way. The practical way is to perform a gravity settling to be able to extract (and possibly recycle separately) the (almost) clear liquid, while managing the mass flow around the crystallizer to obtain a precise slurry density elsewhere. A typical example is the DTB (Draft Tube and Baffle) crystallizer, an idea of Richard Chisum Bennett (a Swenson engineer and later President of Swenson) {{at the end of the}} 1950s. The DTB crystallizer (see images) has an internal circulator, typically an axial <b>flow</b> <b>mixer</b> - yellow - pushing upwards in a draft tube while outside the crystallizer there is a settling area in an annulus; in it the exhaust solution moves upwards at a very low velocity, so that large crystals settle - and return to the main circulation - while only the fines, below a given grain size are extracted and eventually destroyed by increasing or decreasing temperature, thus creating additional supersaturation. A quasi-perfect control of all parameters is achieved as DTF crystallizers offer superior control over crystal size and characteristics. This crystallizer, and the derivative models (Krystal, CSC, etc.) could be the ultimate solution if not for a major limitation in the evaporative capacity, due to the limited diameter of the vapour head and the relatively low external circulation not allowing large amounts of energy to be supplied to the system.|$|E

The flow domain is vertically oriented, {{filled with the}} water. A commercially-available, three-blade impeller, HR- 100, is used as the agitator. The impeller is mounted near {{the tip of a}} thin, rigid shaft, which is aligned along the central axis of the flow domain. The impeller rotates with the constant angular speed of 150 RPM, and the Reynolds number based on the impeller diameter and the blade's tip-velocity is equal to 59400. The turbulence statistics in the vertical measurement planes are reported before (Shekhar C, Nishino K, Yamane Y and Huang J, “Stereo-PIV measurement of turbulence characteristics in a <b>flow</b> <b>mixer</b> ” Journal of Visualization 15 (2012) pp. 293 ~ 308), which revealed that the rotation induces a downward, as well as tangential, bulk flow motion, which convects the turbulence generated at the blade-water interface, causing the turbulence level below the impeller to be much higher than the level above it. The present study is {{the second part of the}} same project, and reports the turbulence statistics in the horizontal measurement planes. The results show that the turbulence level is high in the area swept by the rotating impeller blades and underneath. However, in the outside region, the turbulence damps down and becomes negligible.

The {{focus is on}} the effects of geometrical (i. e. reorientation angle Θ) and temporal (i. e. reorientation frequency τ) parameters of generic inline mixing devices on the Lagrangian particle dynamics and scalar field evolution. Lagrangian dynamics are investigated by constructing Poincaré sections from analytic flow solutions and stroboscopic measurements of particle positions in 2 D RAM laboratory setup. In order to obtain the optimal mixing and homogenization of scalar fields, dye visualizations are performed for an extensive set of parameters. The mixing quality in parameter space is quantitatively evaluated by means of the intensity of segregation. These results are used to determine the optimum forcing protocol. The outcome of this study validates the qualitative agreement in mixing characteristics of 2 D time-periodic and 3 D spatially-periodic flows and confirms the good mixing performance found before for certain RAM configurations.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The goal of the present work is a detailed and comprehensive study to assess {{the accuracy of the}} numerical simulation of the mixing processes in a lobed <b>mixer</b> <b>flow</b> field via a Reynolds-averaged solution method. To meet this goal, the first objective of the current work was to establish the suitability of various meshing strategies that would allow the complex mixer geometries found in current gas-turbine engine designs to be captured, together with the associated convoluted shear layers. A second objective was targeted at providing further insight and understanding of the capability of eddy-viscosity-based turbulence models in capturing the convoluted shear layers. Simplified mixer configurations selected from the literature were studied under incompressible isothermal flow conditions. Two solution algorithms were employed to model the <b>mixer</b> <b>flow</b> fields. The first consisted of a pressure-based structured grid methodology developed for incompressible flows. A density-based mixed-unstructured grid algorithm for compressible flows was also used, with extensions to low Mach number flows made possible through a low Mach number preconditioner. The effects of turbulence were modelled using ak-e turbulence model. The absence of this model in the code made available for the unstructured algorithm necessitated its implementation as a first step in the current work. The effects of unstructured mesh type on the prediction of flows with internal mixing layers were first assessed for an incompressible planar mixing layer. This simplified case was used as a benchmark case to help understand the effects on the convoluted shear layers arising within the lobed <b>mixer</b> <b>flows.</b> To quantify the capability of a Reynolds-averaged approach in simulating the turbulent <b>mixer</b> <b>flow</b> field, two variants of the two equation k-e model were employed. The first constituted the standard linear high Reynolds number k-e model of Launder and Spalding [62]. The second model was a quadratic non-linear version developed by Speziale [99] for the prediction of secondary flows in non-circular ducts. The relative merits of these two models was assessed through detailed comparisons with experimental data taken from the literature. Of particular importance in the <b>mixer</b> <b>flow</b> was the formation and subsequent evolution of the vorticity field. Consequently, this motivated a detailed study of the evolving vorticity field. The investigations thus far were based on a simplified mixer configuration with no temperature differences between the two streams. Therefore, as a final step, a realistic scarfed mixer was modelled in an attempt to model the temperature mixing. The main contribution of the present work is the assessment of a grid-based Reynolds-averaged solution procedure for the prediction of lobed <b>mixer</b> <b>flows.</b> The study revealed that capturing the initial mixing region proved to be most difficult. Firstly, unstruc-tured meshes employing non-hexahedral elements were very inefficient at simulating the mixing layer in the early stages. Secondly, the initial mixing region presented significant difficulties for the Reynolds-averaged solution method in which neither turbulence model was capable of correctly reproducing the turbulence field. Despite this, global parameters such as momentum thickness and streamwise circulation were well captured in the predictions...|$|R

A scheme is proposed for regulating the temperature at the inlet of the first stage compressors by regulating the flow through the primary circuits of the recuperative heat exchangers. The first stage compressor control system allows providing the required modes of operation of the heat pump.
