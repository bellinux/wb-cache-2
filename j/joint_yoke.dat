40|$|Abstract — The power {{transmission}} system is the system which causes movement of vehicles by transferring the torque produced by the engines to the wheels after some modifications. The transfer and modification system of vehicles is called as {{power transmission}} system. The {{power transmission system}} of vehicles consists of several components which encounter unfortunate failures. These failures {{may be attributed to}} material faults, material processing faults, manufacturing and design faults, etc. Maintenance faults and user originated faults may also responsible. Propeller shaft and the universal joints form the important links that help in transmitting power from the engine to the wheels. In this study, analysis is being performed on the universal <b>joint</b> <b>yoke</b> and the propeller shaft. In the universal <b>joint</b> <b>yoke,</b> certain modifications are made in the existing geometry and analysed for the identical loading and boundary conditions as in the reference paper from which the problem has been taken. In case of propeller shaft a comparative study has been made between two shafts differing in their material, keeping in view the possible weight reduction that can be obtained without affecting the functionality of the shaft. Both the components are analysed in ANSYS and the results are compared. I...|$|E
40|$|A {{universal}} joint is a positive, mechanical connection between rotating shafts, {{which are usually}} not parallel, but intersecting. They are used to transmit motion, power, or both. The simplest and most common type is called the Yoke joint, Cardan joint or Hooke joint. It consists of two yokes, one on each shaft, connected by a cross-shaped intermediate member called the spider. The angle between the two shafts is called the operating angle. It Is generally, but not necessarily, constant during operation. Failed Yoke joint {{is the most common}} vehicles driveline problem. In this study, failure analysis of a universal <b>joint</b> <b>yoke</b> of an automobile power transmission would be carried out. For the determination of stress conditions at the failed section, stress analyses can also carried out by the finite element method. Keywords- Yoke joint, failure analysis, FEA...|$|E
40|$|A {{torsional}} vibration at driveline happens seriously at rapid vehicle acceleration. The torsional vi-bration at driveline {{can be reduced}} by optimization of <b>joint</b> angle and <b>yoke</b> phase angle of driveline. But, the joint angle of driveline is changed according to vehicle driving condition as acceleration, deceleration, forward and backward driving, so that excessive vibration is transmitted to vehicle body at specific driving condition. Especially under rapid acceleration condition, vibration transmitted to body could be maximized because excitation force at rapid acceleration is bigger than that at normal driving condition due to changed joint angle. The {{torsional vibration}} of driveline can be kept at low level by controlling suspension parameter to minimize rigid axle displacement as well as optimizin...|$|R
40|$|An {{increased}} demand for greater performance of universal joint of steering column of passenger car has prompted the development of joints capable of long life at high torque, high angles and high loads. This can be easily achieved by investigating or evaluating the torsion loading and its effect over yoke by FEM. New variations of Universal joint have shown the ability to increase universal <b>joint</b> performance.

This paper is about analyses of eddy current loss in 100 kVA 3 phase distribution transformer assembled with the mix 60 °- 0 ° T-joint and mitred lap corner <b>joint</b> with stagger <b>yoke</b> of 5 mm. The loss has been measured using no load test with variable frequency. The eddy current loss rises to be 39. 1 % when the transformer core is energized at flux density of 1. 5 T and frequency of 55 Hz. increase of the frequency will cause the increase of power loss in the transformer core. It caused not all the flux flowing into the middle limb or other limb at difference instant in time of transformer core because there is still flux left {{in the area of}} butt-joint and the core loss that produced at the frequency more than 50 Hz will known as classical eddy current loss...|$|R

40|$|The power {{produced}} from an engine of automobile {{can be transferred}} to the drive wheel by power transmission system. Each automobile has different power transmission system constructive features depend on the vehicle’s driveline concept. (H. Bayrakceken et al., 2006) To transmit the driving torque from the engine or gear unit to the wheels, most of passenger car and light vehicle driven by combustion engine has at least two driveshaft as a basic requirement (Amborn, P. 1995). During operation, torsional stress and bending stress was experienced by driveshaft due to the weight of the car or misalignment of journal bearing (Asi, 2006). In order to meet the requirements {{of one of the most}} highly stressed components in automotive assembly, a failure investigation must be conducted. Finite element method was used as stress analysis to determine the stress conditions at the failed section. Nearly all of driveshaft are metal shafts or metal tubes that has special joint at each end called universal joint (Birch and Rockwood 2005). Power transmission system of vehicles consist several components which sometimes encounter unfortunate failures. Some common reasons for the failures may be manufacturing and design faults, maintenance faults, raw material faults, material processing faults as well as the user originated faults. In this study, fracture analysis of a universal <b>joint</b> <b>yoke</b> and a drive shaft of an automobile power transmission system are carried out. Spectroscopic analyses, metallographic analyses and hardness measurements are carried out for each part. For the determination of stress conditions at the failed section, stress analysis is also carried out by the finite element method. The common failure types in automobiles and revealed that the failures in the transmission system elements cover 1 / 4 of al...|$|E
5000|$|The Thompson {{constant}} velocity joint (TCVJ), {{also known as a}} Thompson coupling, assembles two cardan joints within each other to eliminate the intermediate shaft. A control yoke is added to keep the input and output shafts aligned. The control yoke uses a spherical pantograph scissor mechanism to bisect the angle between the input and output shafts and to maintain the joints at a relative phase angle of zero. The alignment ensures constant angular velocity at all joint angles. Eliminating the intermediate shaft and keeping the input shafts aligned in the homokinetic plane greatly reduces the induced shear stresses and vibration inherent in double cardan shafts. While the geometric configuration does not maintain {{constant velocity}} for the control yoke that aligns the cardan <b>joints,</b> the control <b>yoke</b> has minimal inertia and generates little vibration. Continuous use of a standard Thompson coupling at a straight-through, zero-degree angle will cause excessive wear and damage to the joint; a minimum offset of 2 degrees between the input and output shafts is needed to reduce control yoke wear. Modifying the input and output yokes so that they are not precisely normal to their respective shafts can alter or eliminate the [...] "disallowed" [...] angles.|$|R
