5|$|A keen geographer, Towner {{would often}} {{disappear}} into the bush for weeks on end, for study or exploration. As {{a fellow of the}} Royal <b>Geographical</b> Society of Australia and member of the Royal Historical Society of New South Wales, he took a particular interest in researching the life of the explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell. In 1946, he successfully lobbied the Australian Government to issue a postage stamp commemorating the centenary of Mitchell's discoveries in central Queensland. He addressed the Royal <b>Geographical</b> Society of Australasia in Brisbane in 1955, and was awarded the Dr Thomson Foundation Gold Medal for his <b>geographical</b> work the following year. Towner's address was published in 1957, in a booklet entitled Lake Eyre and its Tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Also {{included}} {{in the category of}} Kurdish <b>geographical</b> name changes are Zazaki, which is considered among Kurdish group, along with Kurmanci. Nişanyan estimates that 4,000 Kurdish <b>geographical</b> locations have been changed.|$|E
5|$|During his {{lifetime}} Bruce received many awards: the Gold Medal of the Royal Scottish <b>Geographical</b> Society in 1904; the Patron's Medal of the Royal <b>Geographical</b> Society in 1910; the Neill prize and Medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1913, and the Livingstone Medal of the American <b>Geographical</b> Society in 1920. He also received an honorary LLD {{degree from the}} University of Aberdeen. The honour that eluded him, however, was the Polar Medal, awarded by the Sovereign {{on the recommendation of}} the Royal <b>Geographical</b> Society. Although the Medal was awarded to the members of every other British or Commonwealth Antarctic expedition during the early 20th century, the SNAE was the exception; the medal was withheld.|$|E
5|$|In November 1854 Markham {{had been}} elected a Fellow of the Royal <b>Geographical</b> Society. The Society soon became the centre of his <b>geographical</b> interests, and in 1863 he was {{appointed}} its honorary secretary, a position he was to hold for 25years.|$|E
5|$|Nişanyan {{estimates}} that 4,200 Greek <b>geographical</b> locations have been changed, {{the most of}} any ethnic minority.|$|E

5|$|The National Antarctic Expedition, {{known as}} the Discovery Expedition after the ship Discovery, {{was the brainchild of}} Sir Clements Markham, {{president}} of the Royal <b>Geographical</b> Society, and had been many years in preparation. It was led by Robert Falcon Scott, a Royal Navy torpedo lieutenant lately promoted Commander, and had objectives that included scientific and <b>geographical</b> discovery.|$|E

5|$|A {{fellow of}} the Royal <b>Geographical</b> Society and the Explorers Club, Fossett set {{more than one hundred}} records in five {{different}} sports, sixty of which still stood {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E
5|$|After their {{trips to}} the Himalaya, the Workmans gave lectures about their travels. They were invited to learned societies; Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the Sorbonne and the second {{to speak at the}} Royal <b>Geographical</b> Society. She {{received}} many medals of honor from European climbing and <b>geographical</b> societies and was {{recognized as one of the}} foremost climbers of her day. She demonstrated that a woman could climb in high altitudes just as well as a man and helped break down the gender barrier in mountaineering.|$|E
5|$|Ain't {{is found}} {{throughout}} the English-speaking world across regions and classes, and {{is among the most}} pervasive nonstandard terms in English. It is one of two negation features (the other being the double negative) that are known to appear in all nonstandard English dialects. Ain't is used throughout the United Kingdom, with its <b>geographical</b> distribution increasing over time. It is also {{found throughout the}} United States, including in Appalachia, the South, New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Upper Midwest. In its <b>geographical</b> ubiquity, ain't is to be contrasted with other folk usages such as y'all, which is confined to the South region of the United States.|$|E
5|$|As {{would be}} {{expected}} for a widespread passerine bird species, several <b>geographical</b> subspecies are recognised. The treatment of subspecies in this article follows Clement et al. (2000).|$|E

5|$|Borchgrevink's {{expedition}} objectives comprised commercial, {{scientific and}} <b>geographical</b> goals. He considered forming {{a company to}} exploit the extensive guano deposits that he had observed during his 1894–95 voyage, but this came to nothing. In numerous addresses to scientific societies, he stressed the extent of work that could {{be carried out by}} a resident expedition, including the possibility of establishing the location of the South Magnetic Pole. The team of scientists that Borchgrevink appointed, though inexperienced, covered a wide range of disciplines—magnetism, meteorology, biology, zoology, taxidermy and cartography. Borchgrevink also hoped that the expedition's scientific achievements could be matched by spectacular <b>geographical</b> discoveries and journeys, even perhaps an attempt on the <b>geographical</b> South Pole itself. With no knowledge of the continent's geography, he was unaware that the site of the base at Cape Adare would rule out any serious exploration of the Antarctic interior.|$|E
5|$|By-laws are {{regulations}} made {{by certain}} {{public and private}} bodies, for instance, strata title management corporations. Their extent is usually limited to a relatively small <b>geographical</b> area or to the operations of a particular body only.|$|E
5|$|During {{the lengthy}} period of ancient Rome, the Capitoline Hill was the <b>geographical</b> and {{ceremonial}} center. However, by the Renaissance, the former center was an untidy conglomeration of dilapidated {{buildings and the}} site of executions of criminals.|$|E
5|$|Early Europeans {{replaced}} most of {{the original}} Māori names with their own, although they retained some Māori names {{in the north and}} central regions of the North Island. The Royal <b>Geographical</b> Society of London was responsible for place names until 1894 when authority was given to the Governor of New Zealand. Prime Minister Joseph Ward moved an amendment in 1894 that gave preference to Māori names for any new features and allowed misspelt names to be altered (although this did not always occur). In 1924 the Honorary Geographic Board of New Zealand was set up to advise on place names, and in 1946 the New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) was established and given power to change or implement Māori and English names. Anyone can propose a <b>geographical</b> name to the board, who consult local Māori and allow public submissions before determining if the name should be made official. Names can also be made official through an Act of Parliament and the NZGB is required to keep a public list of all the official New Zealand <b>geographical</b> names.|$|E
5|$|Historical subdivisions of Scotland {{included}} the mormaerdom, stewartry, earldom, burgh, parish, county and regions and districts. Some of these names are still sometimes used as <b>geographical</b> descriptors.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the calculation of association, {{it is common to}} take into account any variables that could potentially confound the results. Sex and age are common examples of confounding variables. Moreover, it is also known that many genetic variations are associated with the <b>geographical</b> and historical populations in which the mutations first arose. Because of this association, studies must take account of the <b>geographical</b> and ethnical background of participants by controlling for what is called population stratification.|$|E
5|$|Most of the <b>geographical</b> name changes {{occurred}} in the eastern provinces {{of the country and}} on the coast of the eastern Black Sea, where minority populations tend to live. Through independent study, etymologist Sevan Nisanyan estimates that, of the <b>geographical</b> location name changes, 4,200 were Greek, 4,000 Kurdish, 3,600 Armenian, 750 Arabic, 400 Assyrian, 300 Georgian, 200 Laz, and 50 others. The official statistics of The Special Commission for Name Change (Ad Degistirme Ihtisas Komisyonu) claim that the total number of villages, towns, cities, and settlements renamed is 12,211. The chart below lists the provinces and the number of villages or towns renamed.|$|E
5|$|Newfoundland and Labrador is the easternmost {{province}} in Canada. The Strait of Belle Isle separates the {{province in}}to two <b>geographical</b> divisions, Labrador {{and the island}} of Newfoundland. The province also includes over seven thousand small islands.|$|E
5|$|Nurkse also refuted {{the claim}} that if a country's <b>geographical</b> area is large, {{the size of its}} market also ought to be large. A country may be {{extremely}} small in area but still have a large effective demand. For example, Japan. In contrast, a country may cover a huge <b>geographical</b> area but its market may still be small. This may occur if {{a large part of the}} country is uninhabitable, or if the country suffers from low productivity levels and thus has a low National Income.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>geographical</b> {{features}} {{inside the}} park include: U-shaped valleys, 660 tropical glaciers (the largest glaciated area in the tropics), 300 glacial lakes and high plateaus intersected by ravines with torrential creeks.|$|E
5|$|Rates of MS {{appear to}} be increasing; this, however, may be {{explained}} simply by better diagnosis. Studies on populational and <b>geographical</b> patterns have been common and {{have led to a}} number of theories about the cause.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} also failed to find {{evidence}} for well-defined subspecies, which are no longer recognized. Larson (1997) studied the morphological variation in the jaguar and showed there is clinal north–south variation, but also the differentiation within the supposed subspecies is larger than that between them, and thus does not warrant subspecies subdivision. A genetic study by Eizirik and coworkers in 2001 confirmed {{the absence of a}} clear <b>geographical</b> subspecies structure, although they found that major <b>geographical</b> barriers, such as the Amazon River, limited the exchange of genes between the different populations. A subsequent, more detailed study confirmed the predicted population structure within the Colombian jaguars.|$|E
5|$|Sachs {{proposed}} that a <b>geographical</b> chronology until approximately 1400 is preferable, however, {{due to its}} limited subjectivity. Beyond 1400, one can follow the overall development of musical instruments by time period.|$|E
5|$|Several {{nations have}} changed during their Olympic history. Name changes due to <b>geographical</b> {{renaming}} are explained by footnotes after the nation's name, and other changes are explained by footnotes links within the table itself.|$|E
5|$|Surface weather {{analysis}} {{is a special}} type of weather map that provides a view of weather elements over a <b>geographical</b> area at a specified time based on information from ground-based weather stations.|$|E
5|$|The Arsenal Training Centre, often {{referred}} to as its <b>geographical</b> location London Colney in Hertfordshire, is the training ground of Arsenal Football Club. It houses ten full-size pitches, an indoor facility and a medical and rehabilitation centre.|$|E
5|$|The British National Antarctic Expedition, 1901–04, {{generally}} {{known as}} the Discovery Expedition, was the first official British exploration of the Antarctic regions since James Clark Ross's voyage sixty years earlier. Organized {{on a large scale}} under a joint committee of the Royal Society and the Royal <b>Geographical</b> Society (RGS), the new expedition carried out scientific research and <b>geographical</b> exploration in what was then largely an untouched continent. It launched the Antarctic careers of many who would become leading figures in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, including Robert Falcon Scott who led the expedition, Ernest Shackleton, Edward Wilson, Frank Wild, Tom Crean and William Lashly.|$|E
5|$|The Hindu {{caste system}} is first {{mentioned}} in the ancient Hindu scriptures like the Vedas and the Upanishads. Various sub-classifications of the caste system exist, many based on the <b>geographical</b> origin of the caste.|$|E
