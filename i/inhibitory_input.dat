5|$|Cerebellar granule cells, in {{contrast}} to Purkinje cells, are among the smallest neurons in the brain. They are also easily the most numerous neurons in the brain: In humans, estimates of their total number average around 50 billion, which means that about 3/4 of the brain's neurons are cerebellar granule cells. Their cell bodies are packed into a thick layer {{at the bottom of}} the cerebellar cortex. A granule cell emits only four to five dendrites, each of which ends in an enlargement called a dendritic claw.

5|$|The deep nuclei of the {{cerebellum}} are {{clusters of}} gray matter lying {{within the white}} matter {{at the core of}} the cerebellum. They are, with the minor exception of the nearby vestibular nuclei, the sole sources of output from the cerebellum. These nuclei receive collateral projections from mossy fibers and climbing fibers as well as <b>inhibitory</b> <b>input</b> from the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. The four nuclei (dentate, globose, emboliform, and fastigial) each communicate with different parts of the brain and cerebellar cortex. (The globose and the emboliform nuclei are also referred to as combined in the interposed nucleus). The fastigial and interposed nuclei belong to the spinocerebellum. The dentate nucleus, which in mammals is much larger than the others, is formed as a thin, convoluted layer of gray matter, and communicates exclusively with the lateral parts of the cerebellar cortex. The flocculonodular lobe is the only part of the cerebellar cortex that does not project to the deep nuclei—its output goes to the vestibular nuclei instead.|$|E

40|$|The substantia gelatinosa (SG) of {{the spinal}} dorsal horn shows {{significant}} morphological heterogeneity and receives primary afferent input predominantly from Aδ- and C-fibres. Despite numerous anatomical and physiological studies, correlation between morphology and functional connectivity, particularly {{in terms of}} <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs,</b> remains elusive. To compare excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> synaptic <b>inputs</b> on individual SG neurones with morphology, we performed whole-cell recordings with Neurobiotin-filled-pipettes in horizontal slices from adult rat spinal cord with attached dorsal roots. Based on dendritic arborization patterns, four major cell types were confirmed: islet, central, radial and vertical cells. Dorsal root stimulation revealed that each class was associated with characteristic synaptic inputs. Islet and central cells had monosynaptic excitatory inputs exclusively from C-afferents. Islet cells received primary-afferent-evoked <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs</b> only from Aδ-fibres, while those of central cells were mediated by both Aδ- and C-fibres. In contrast, radial and vertical cells had monosynaptic excitatory inputs from both Aδ- and C-fibres and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs</b> mediated by both fibre types. We further characterized the neurochemical nature of these <b>inhibitory</b> synaptic <b>inputs.</b> The majority of islet, central and vertical cells exhibited GABAergic <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs,</b> while almost all radial cells also possessed glycinergic inputs.

25|$|Type 1 episodic ataxia (EA1) is {{characterized}} by attacks of generalized ataxia induced by emotion or stress, with myokymia both during and between attacks. This disorder {{is also known as}} episodic ataxia with myokymia (EAM), hereditary paroxysmal ataxia with neuromyotonia and Isaacs-Mertens syndrome. Onset of EA1 occurs during early childhood to adolescence and persists throughout the patient's life. Attacks last from seconds to minutes. Mutations of the gene KCNA1, which encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel KV1.1, are responsible for this subtype of episodic ataxia. KV1.1 is expressed heavily in basket cells and interneurons that form GABAergic synapses on Purkinje cells. The channels aid in the repolarization phase of action potentials, thus affecting <b>inhibitory</b> <b>input</b> into Purkinje cells and, thereby, all motor output from the cerebellum. EA1 {{is an example of a}} synaptopathy. There are currently 17 KV1.1 mutations associated with EA1, Table 1 and Figure 1. 15 of these mutations have been at least partly characterized in cell culture based electrophysiological assays wherein 14 of these 15 mutations have demonstrated drastic alterations in channel function. As described in Table 1, most of the known EA1 associated mutations result in a drastic decrease in the amount of current through KV1.1 channels. Furthermore, these channels tend to activate at more positive potentials and slower rates, demonstrated by positive shifts in their V½ values and slower τ activation time constants, respectively. Some of these mutations, moreover, produce channels that deactivate at faster rates (deactivation τ), which would also result in decreased current through these channels. While these biophysical changes in channel properties likely underlie some of the decrease in current observed in experiments, many mutations also seem to result in misfolded or otherwise mistrafficked channels, which is likely to be the major cause of dysfunction and disease pathogenesis. It is assumed, though not yet proven, that decrease in KV1.1 mediated current leads to prolonged action potentials in interneurons and basket cells. As these cells are important in the regulation of Purkinje cell activity, it is likely that this results increased and aberrant <b>inhibitory</b> <b>input</b> into Purkinje cells and, thus, disrupted Purkinje cell firing and cerebellum output.|$|E
25|$|A {{good example}} of this contradiction {{can be seen in the}} {{literature}} regarding the R192Q mutation. The first investigation of this mutation, using the rabbit isoform of the channel expressed in oocytes, found that it did not alter any measured channel properties. A subsequent report, using human channels expressed in HEK293 Cells, found a small hyperpolarizing shift in the midpoint for activation, a result common among FHM1 mutants. This shift results in channels that open at more negative potentials and, thus, have a higher open probability than wild-type channels at most potentials. This report also found that the R192Q mutant produced almost twice as much whole-cell current compared to wild-type channels. This is not due to a change in single channel conductance but to an equivalent increase in channel density. A subsequent group noticed that this mutation is in a region important for modulation by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCR activation leads to inhibition of wild-type CaV2.1 currents. R192Q mutant channel currents are also decreased by GPCR activation, but by a smaller amount. A more recent group has confirmed some of these results by creating a R192Q knock-in mouse. They confirmed that the R192Q mutant activates at more negative potentials and that neurons producing these channels have much larger whole-cell current. This resulted in a much larger quantal content (the number of neurotransmitter packets released per action potential) and generally enhanced neurotransmitter release in R192Q expressing neurons versus wild-type. Consequently, these mutant mice were more susceptible to cortical-spreading-depression than their wild-type counterparts. The most recent experiments on this mutant, however, have contradicted some of these results. In CaV2.1 knockout neurons transfected with human channels, P/Q-type currents from mutant channels are actually smaller than their wild-type counterpart. They also found a significant decrease in calcium influx during depolarization, leading to decreased quantal content, in mutant versus wild-type expressing neurons. Neurons expressing mutant channels were also less able to mediate <b>inhibitory</b> <b>input</b> and have smaller inhibitory postsynaptic currents through P/Q-type channels. Further testing with this and other mutants is required to determine their end affect on human physiology.|$|E
500|$|The reflexogenic pathway {{activates}} the parasympathetic {{nervous system}} {{in response to the}} sensation of touch. It is mediated by a reflex arc that goes to the spinal cord (not to the brain) and is served by the sacral segments of the spinal cord at S2–S4. A woman with a spinal cord lesion above T11 {{may not be able to}} experience psychogenic vaginal lubrication, but may still have reflex lubrication if her sacral segments are uninjured. Likewise, although a man's ability to get a psychogenic erection when mentally aroused may be impaired after a higher-level SCI, he may still be able to get a reflex or [...] "spontaneous" [...] erection. These erections may result in the absence of psychological arousal when the penis is touched or brushed, e.g. by clothing, but they do not last long and are generally lost when the stimulus is removed. Reflex erections may increase in frequency after SCI, due to the loss of <b>inhibitory</b> <b>input</b> from the brain that would suppress the response in an uninjured man. Conversely, an injury below the S1 level impairs reflex erections but not psychogenic erections. People who have some preservation of sensation in the dermatomes at the S4 and S5 levels and display a bulbocavernosus reflex (contraction of the pelvic floor in response to pressure on the clitoris or glans penis) are usually able to experience reflex erections or lubrication. Like other reflexes, reflexive sexual responses may be lost immediately after injury but return over time as the individual recovers from spinal shock.|$|E
40|$|AbstractÐThe {{integrative}} {{properties of}} neurons depend strongly on the number, proportions {{and distribution of}} excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> synaptic <b>inputs</b> they receive. In this study the three-dimensional geometry of dendritic trees and the density of symmetrical and asymmetrical synapses on different cellular compartments of rat hippocampal CA 1 area pyramidal cells was measured to calculate the total number and distribution of excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs</b> on a single cell. A single pyramidal cell has, 12, 000 mm dendrites and receives around 30, 000 excitatory and 1700 <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs,</b> of which 40 % are concentrated in the perisomatic region and 20 % on dendrites in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare. The preand post-synaptic features suggest that CA 1 pyramidal cell dendrites are heterogeneous. Strata radiatum and oriens dendrites are similar and differ from stratum lacunosum-moleculare dendrites. Proximal apical and basal strata radiatum and oriens dendrites are spine-free or sparsely spiny. Distal strata radiatum and oriens dendrites (forming 68. 5 % of the pyramidal cells' dendritic tree) are densely spiny; their excitatory inputs terminate exclusively on dendritic spines, while <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs</b> target only dendritic shafts. The proportion of <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs</b> on distal spiny strata radiatum and oriens dendrites is low (, 3 %). In contrast, proximal dendritic segments receive mostly (70 ± 100 %) <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs.</b> Only <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs</b> innervate the somata (77 ± 103 per cell) and axon initial segments.

Furthermore, <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs</b> on axons have opposite effects on neuronal activity according to their temporal integration with upstream signals. Concurrent with somatic depolarization, <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs</b> on axons decrease neuronal excitability and impede spike generation.

This condition captures {{an important aspect of}} the effect of the anesthetic cascade. In particular, as the anesthetic drug concentration increases, resulting in an increase in the inhibitory time constants, the excitatory synaptic drives that receive <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs</b> from <b>inhibitory</b> neurons, which themselves do not receive <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs,</b> converge to zero, reflecting a state of unconsciousness.

Excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs</b> to pyramidal cells originated preferentially from regions with similar orientation preference.

40|$|SummaryThe {{receptive}} field (RF) of single visual neurons undergoes progressive refinement during development. It remains largely unknown how the excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs</b> on single developing neurons are refined in a coordinated manner {{to allow the}} formation of functionally correct circuits. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recording from Xenopus tectal neurons, we found that RFs determined by excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs</b> in more mature tectal neurons are spatially matched, with each spot stimulus evoking balanced synaptic excitation and inhibition. This emerges during development through a gradual reduction in the RF size and a transition from disparate to matched topography of excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs</b> to the tectal neurons. Altering normal spiking activity of tectal neurons by either blocking or elevating GABAA receptor activity significantly impeded the developmental reduction and topographic matching of RFs.

Recent work {{has focused on the}} contribution of conductances mediating persistent inward currents (PICs), which amplify and prolong the effects of synaptic inputs on motoneuron discharge. Certain features of human motor unit discharge are thought to reflect a relatively stereotyped activation of PICs by excitatory synaptic inputs; these features include rate saturation and de-recruitment at a lower level of net excitation than that required for recruitment. However, PIC activation is also influenced by the pattern and spatial distribution of <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs</b> that are activated concurrently with excitatory inputs. To estimate the potential contributions of PIC activation and synaptic input patterns to motor unit discharge patterns, we examined the responses of a set of cable motoneuron models to different patterns of excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs.</b> The models were first tuned to approximate the current- and voltage-clamp responses of low- and medium-threshold spinal motoneurons studied in decerebrate cats and then driven with different patterns of excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs.</b> The responses of the models to excitatory inputs reproduced a number of features of human motor unit discharge. However, the pattern of rate modulation was strongly influenced by the temporal and spatial pattern of concurrent <b>inhibitory</b> <b>inputs.</b> Thus, even though PIC activation is likely to exert a strong influence on firing rate modulation, PIC activation in combination with different patterns of excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> synaptic <b>inputs</b> can produce a wide variety of motor unit discharge patterns...|$|R
