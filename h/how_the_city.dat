5|$|Free agent pitcher Mike Mussina {{signed with}} the Yankees before their 2001 season began, and the club {{pulled away from the}} Red Sox as the year progressed to claim another divisional championship, as Clemens won 20 games. The September 11 attacks {{interrupted}} the season, and the resumption of baseball in New York became a symbol of <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> recovered from the destruction of the Twin Towers. After falling behind 2–0 in the ALDS against the Athletics, the Yankees won three straight contests to advance to the ALCS. They prevailed in five games against the Seattle Mariners, who had tied a single-season MLB record with 116 regular season wins, for the team's fourth straight AL pennant. The Arizona Diamondbacks gained a two-game lead in the 2001 World Series before the Yankees won three consecutive ballgames; New York home runs with two outs in the ninth inning of Games 4 and 5 led to extra inning wins in both games, with Game 4 ended by a Jeter home run. The Yankees' championship streak ended, though, as the Diamondbacks won the Series in seven games with a late rally in the final inning of Game 7.|$|E

25|$|The {{early and}} {{dramatic}} advent of High Victorian architecture in Birmingham {{took place in}} 1855 with the completion of 12 Ampton Road in Edgbaston by John Henry Chamberlain. Martin & Chamberlain were prolific architects in Birmingham during the Victorian era, having designed 41 Birmingham board schools. John Henry Chamberlain, who was not of local descent, was part of Martin & Chamberlain and his works in Birmingham include Highbury Hall and Birmingham School of Art, which was completed by his son Frederick Martin following his sudden death in 1883. The cutting of Corporation Street through slums in the city centre began in 1878 {{and much of the}} work for designing the buildings that were to line the street was given to Martin & Chamberlain. Numerous buildings, which had leases of 99 years, were demolished in the post-war period, however, the street has retained many of its fine Victorian buildings above modern ground-floor façades, providing an insight into <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> once looked.|$|E

500|$|Finally, in {{probably}} June 348 BC, {{with all}} the other cities captured or in submission, Philip moved to attack Olynthos. According to Diodorus, there were two pitched battles against the Olynthians; after being defeated twice, the Olynthians were then confined [...] to the city. Two of the commanders of Olynthos, Euthycrates and Lasthenes, defected to Philip with 500 cavalry shortly before the siege. Diodorus therefore claims that the city fell by treachery; certainly treachery was committed, {{but it is not clear}} that this is <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was captured. Either way, by September the siege was over, and the Chalkidian league had been annihilated. Philip razed the city, and sold the remaining inhabitants into slavery; the same fate awaited the other Chalkidian cities that had not submitted to him. Philip then incorporated Chalkidike into the Macedonian state, distributing the land amongst his followers.|$|E

Nelson stated, [...] "(i)n Chicago, at this time, Harold Washington is like an icon. He's like a deity." [...] In particular, Nelson painted the portrait after seeing prints of [...] "Worry Ye Not", another poster that depicted a smiling Washington with a blue-robe adorned Jesus Christ, looking down on the Chicago skyline. Nelson later testified that he had based the iconoclastic elements of the painting on a rumor that doctors at Northwestern Memorial Hospital had discovered female underwear beneath the suit Washington was wearing {{at the time of his}} death. Three weeks after the controversy erupted, in {{an interview}} with the New Art Examiner, Nelson explained that the portrait referenced an existing photograph of Washington holding a cigarette prop at an American Cancer Society event.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{compared}} Sunset Overdrives gameplay to pinball games, where a player's {{every movement}} has consequences, and the on-screen chaos created by players {{is based on}} their actions. The game's combat and traversal elements were originally separate from each other, but were later connected as the team began to think that: [...] "shooting while grinding was fun". The combination of these aspects led the studio to adjust the game's world design. The team calculated <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> should be designed {{so that it could}} support both combat and traversal. As a result, they ensured that the world was built in modular 4x4 blocks, and that no surface featured an angle that was between 26 and 45 degrees. Furthermore, the team considered how long grinds should be, and decided that they should be at least 8 meters in length. The grinds were designed to be longer than usual in enemy-concentrated areas so as to allow additional time for players to consider both combat and traversal options. In order to encourage experimentation, the game features a vertical map-design, in which the difficulty the enemies' players face increases as they move towards higher ground.|$|E
