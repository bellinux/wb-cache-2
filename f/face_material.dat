40|$|Technical BriefTechnical Brief 2 : Mechanical seals {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of {{industrial}} applications, sealing gases in a compressor or sealing liquids in a pump. Reliability, longevity, emission control and safety are now more important than ever. This purpose sounds simple, but designing mechanical seal components and selecting the most appropriate materials is a real challenge, especially when sealing fluids under harsh operating conditions. This paper describes two applications using a unique sealing solution, an engineered seal design and a specific sliding face diamond material. In the first case, the end-user in Venezuela is using Multiphase Pumping Technology to transfer a mixture of crude oil and gas in a single pipeline without separation. The installed seals have to handle a mixture of crude oil, formation water, solids and natural gas. Previously, no mechanical seals were available for such conditions and consequently engineered seals have been developed for this purpose. The pumped fluid does not provide the required stable liquid lubrication film for their mechanical seal faces. Another challenge is the presence of abrasive particles. So the selection of the seal face materials is important. Extremely robust face materials are required to avoid unacceptable deformations and to minimize abrasive wear which may result in a mechanical seal failure. Multiple seal arrangements available today can handle multiphase fluids, using hard/hard face materials in combination with a complex auxiliary/flush system, but have only limited capabilities with regard to poor lubrication and necessary cooling, when handling crude oil with high viscosity and natural gas. In this specific application described in this paper, a sophisticated Single Mechanical Seal has been used successfully over many years. However, due to changing oil well conditions, the lifetime of their mechanical seals was reduced dramatically. To solve this problem, a slurry seal design in combination with the diamond seal <b>face</b> <b>material,</b> well-known for its ultimate hardness, was installed. Seal faces with diamond surfaces offer outstanding abrasive resistance due to their unique hardness similar to natural stone and, at the same time provide considerably improved dry running performance due to their low friction coefficient. In the second case, the end-user in Brazil is using High Pressure Pipeline Pumps for the transportation of the heavy crude oil. In case of high pressures, high speed and abrasive particles, which is typical in crude oil applications, their mechanical seals need special attention. Extremely hard and strong face materials are required to avoid unacceptable deformations and to minimise abrasive wear which may result in high leakage. State of the art hard/hard <b>face</b> <b>material</b> combinations cannot handle crude oil with high viscosity and have limited capabilities with regard to poor lubrication associated with the necessary cooling. In both applications, in a multiphase twin screw pump and in a centrifugal pipeline pump, engineered mechanical seals with diamond seal <b>face</b> <b>material</b> solved the problem and are used successfully since the start-up of the pumps. This new sealing technology offers significant benefits to the end-user...|$|E

This article explores some underlying dynamics of this phenomenon, referred to here as “$ 2 -a-day poverty,” presenting evidence from both qualitative fieldwork and quantitative analysis of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The rise in $ 2 -a-day poverty has been concentrated among children experiencing it chronically—that is, for seven or more months during a calendar year. Both qualitative and quantitative evidence find that a large majority of children experiencing $ 2 -a-day poverty live in households where an adult worked during the year, while only a small proportion live in households accessing TANF.

40|$|International audiencePatients with {{schizophrenia}} have pronounced {{deficits in}} face recognition memory that severely hamper their social skills. The functional mechanisms of these impairments remain unknown. According to the dual-process theory, recognition memory comprises two distinct components: recollection and familiarity. Studies using the Remember/Know procedure {{in patients with}} schizophrenia showed impairments in conscious recollection as measured by remember responses, but not in familiarity as measured by know responses. Unfortunately, none of these studies used <b>face</b> <b>material.</b> We investigated both recognition memory components using words and faces and the 'Remember/Know' procedure in 25 patients with schizophrenia and 24 control participants. In the same task, size congruency of stimuli was manipulated between the study and test phases to have a selective impact on know responses for faces. Patients reported fewer remember responses than controls. Size changes between the study and the test affected know responses in controls but not in patients. These results reveal that patients with schizophrenia are impaired {{in terms of their}} ability to recollect details about previously seen faces as they are for words...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. 4 H-SiC MOSFET devices {{with low}} {{temperature}} dry thermal oxidation (1050 ºC 1 h) and TEOS plasma enhanced CVD deposited oxides on 4 H-SiC substrates have been analysed in this paper. MOSFET transistors have been fabricated on the 4 H-SiC (0001) Si face. The mobility improvement (up to 38 - 45 cm 2 /Vs) is remarkable compared with standard oxidation (< 10 cm 2 /Vs). In addition, very high (but controversial) field-effect mobilities of around 216 cm 2 /Vs {{have also been}} extracted for MOSFETs fabricated on the (11 - 20) face. Taking into account the threshold voltage and the sub-threshold slope (S), {{we can see that}} we have three different ways to increase the mobility.

40|$|The {{problem of}} heat {{transfer}} across honeycomb sandwich panels is theoretically investigated. The basic {{objective is to}} predict the rear surface temperature {{as a function of}} time when the front surface is exposed to a prescribed heat flux; the faces are bounded by planar sheets so that the air circulation in the honeycomb cells is bounded and contained. The influence of the air circulation on convective heat transfer is explicitly included. Drawing upon previous investigators' results that indicated various relations for the Nusselt numbers vs Rayleigh numbers in different regimes of the aspect ratio (defined as the ratio of the cell height to cell width), parametric calculations are performed to predict the rear surface temperatures. Chemical degradation of the material, especially the glue holding the <b>face</b> <b>material</b> on the end, is important but has not yet been included. The results indicate that decreasing the cell width, increasing the cell wall thickness and increasing the cell height all have beneficial effects upon the heat transfer; i. e., all of these variations reduce rear surface temperature for a given time for a prescribed heat flux on the front surface...|$|E

It reports the design process, starting from the project description with definition of targets followed by a theoretical evaluation of the seal performance and a description of the final design features. Increasing demand for high pressure and high temperature (HP/HT) pumps in Subsea multiphase applications requires the development of mechanical seals designed for pressure levels up to 15 kpsi and product temperatures up to 350 ?F with the capability to handle reverse pressure conditions. With the high pressure requirements the application of spring-energized polymer gaskets as static and dynamic secondary seals using a specific design for enhanced reverse pressurization capability were selected. To achieve enhanced robustness of the seal faces in transient dry running condition which may occur during upset conditions (such as reverse pressure) the design was optimized to include microcrystalline diamond coated seal faces. A detailed analysis of face deformation and seal performance under load with a combined structure and fluid analysis software together with an extensive test campaign and specific cooling jacket features lead to a robust mechanical seal design with optimized pressure distribution and mechanical contact zones...|$|E
