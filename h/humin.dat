40|$|A {{quantitative}} assessment of structural constituents in humic substances has been achieved {{on the basis of}} 13 C-NMR spectra of the residues obtained after multi-step chemical degradations. The sequence used (ultrasonic disruption in methylene chloride, followed by boron-trifluoride-methanol transesterification and hydroiodic acid treatment) was designed to progressively remove structures predominantly associated by physical interactions, ester bonds and ether bonds, leading to a residue presumably consisting of a C-C linked skeletal network. The substances analyzed were humic acids (HAs) from four widely different soil types in addition to the corresponding <b>humins</b> isolated by two procedures based, respectively, on flotation in a dense liquid after ultrasonic disaggregation and on partition in water-methylisobutylketone. About 30 % of the carbon in HAs and <b>humins</b> was transformed into soluble materials by the transesterification treatment, whereas a large variability in the amount of the structures removed by the ether-cleaving treatment was observed, the greatest values corresponding to <b>humins.</b> In both cases, the above treatments seem to lead to a kerogen-like residue. The results provide indirect evidence for the presence of non-hydrolyzable esters, heavily-altered glycolipid-like structures and recalcitrant polymethylene material in humic substances.

In this study, release patterns of glucose, 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (5 -HMF), and levulinic acid from switchgrass cellulose were investigated through a mechanistic kinetic model. The predictions {{were consistent with the}} measured products of interest when new parameters reflecting the effects of reaction limitations, such as cellulose crystallinity, acid soluble lignin–glucose complex (ASL–glucose) and <b>humins</b> that cannot be quantitatively analyzed, were included. The new mechanistic kinetic model incorporating these parameters simulated the experimental data with R² above 0. 97. Results showed that glucose yield was most sensitive to variations in the parameter regarding the cellulose crystallinity at low temperatures (140 – 180 °C), while the impact of crystallinity on the glucose yield became imperceptible at elevated temperatures (200 – 220 °C). Parameters related to the undesired products (e. g.  ASL–glucose and <b>humins)</b> were the most sensitive factors compared with rate constants and other additional parameters in impacting the levulinic acid yield at elevated temperatures (200 – 220 °C), while their impacts were negligible at 140 – 180 °C. These new findings provide a more rational explanation for the kinetic changes in dilute acid pretreatment performance and suggest that the influences of cellulose crystallinity and undesired products including ASL–glucose and <b>humins</b> play key roles in determining the generation of glucose, 5 -HMF and levulinic acid from biomass-derived cellulose...|$|R

40|$|The aging {{effects of}} sorption-desorption of two {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), that is, phenanthrene and chrysene on different natural organic matters (NOMs), that is, humic acid, fulvic acid, and <b>humins</b> of different sources were studied. Both organic carbon-normalized distribution coefficients (K-oc) and the reversible desorption fractions (f(rd)) were evaluated. Results showed that aging effects were both sorbent and sorbate specific. With increasing aging duration, K(oc) s of phenanthrene on <b>humins</b> increased, whereas K(oc) s of chrysene did not change significantly. Significant f(rd) declinations over aging times were observed for all the NOMs, which demonstrated the effects of aging on availability of PAHs. Furthermore, the f(rd) was not only positively correlated with the atomic O/C ratio of NOMs, which represent the geological maturity of NOMs, but also varied with the property of sorbates. We conclude that aging effects of HOCs on NOMs should be a case-specific process and the desorption reversibility depends on the structure and characteristics of both NOMs and sorbates.

40|$|A simple, cheap, and {{selective}} catalyst based on copper/cerium oxides is described for the oxidation of 5 -(hydroxymethyl) furfural (5 -HMF) in water. An almost quantitative conversion (99 %) with excellent (90 %) selectivity towards {{the formation of}} 5 -formyl- 2 -furancarboxylic acid, a platform molecule for other high value chemicals, is observed. The catalyst does not require any pretreatment or additives, such as bases, to obtain high yield and selectivity in water as solvent and using oxygen as oxidant. When a physical mixture of the oxides is used, low conversion and selectivity are observed. Air can be used instead of oxygen, but a lower conversion rate is observed if the same overall pressure is used, and the selectivity remains high. The catalyst can be recovered almost quantitatively and reused. Deactivation of the catalyst, observed in repeated runs, {{is due to the}} deposition of <b>humins</b> on its surface.
