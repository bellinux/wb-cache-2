5|$|The {{street was}} named Bow Street in 1638 after its basic shape. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> the Earl's {{intention}} to extend {{it as far}} as Long Acre, but this was delayed. It was eventually connected by his son, William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford, who gave ownership of the street over to the Paving Commissioners of St. Martin in the Fields, so it could be a public right of way.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{suffrage}} {{movement in}} Wales attempted {{to show a}} level of independence, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> following rather than leading a national agenda. It depended deeply in its embryonic years on celebrated suffragists from outside its borders to bring crowds to town meetings, but still relied on a network of now forgotten non-militant supporters who organised and campaigned on the ground level. And, although failing to significantly draw a rural Welsh-speaking heartland to its cause, it still embraced a national sense of pride and values that contrasted to their neighbours in England.|$|E

5|$|Louis Braille {{survived the}} torment of the {{infection}} {{but by the}} age of five he was completely blind in both eyes. Due to his young age, Braille did not realize at first that he had lost his sight, and often asked why <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> dark. His parents made many efforts – quite uncommon for the era – to raise their youngest child in a normal fashion, and he prospered in their care. He learned to navigate the village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him, and he grew up seemingly at peace with his disability. Braille's bright and creative mind impressed the local teachers and priests, and he was accommodated with higher education.|$|E
5|$|At age sixteen, Stone began {{teaching}} in district schools, as her brothers and sister, Rhoda, also did. Her beginning pay of $1.00 a day was {{much lower than}} that of male teachers, and when she substituted for her brother, Bowman, one winter, she received less pay than he received. When she protested to the school committee that she had taught all the subjects Bowman had, it replied that they could give her “only a woman’s pay.” Lower pay for women was one of the arguments cited by those promoting the hiring of women as teachers: “To make education universal, it must be at moderate expense, and women can afford to teach for one-half, or even less, the salary which men would ask.” Although Stone’s salary increased along with the size of her schools, until she finally received $16 a month, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> lower than the male rate.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 16thcentury, the town became an important trading port. The town took advantage of its east coast location, which facilitated trading contacts with the Low Countries, the Baltic region, England, and Northern France. The feu-ferme charter of 1451 between the Abbot of Dunfermline and the burgesses of Kirkcaldy mentioned a small but functioning harbour; it is not known when this harbour was established, or whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> located {{at the mouth of the}} East Burn. According to treasurers' accounts of the early 16thcentury, timber imported via the harbour—possibly from the Baltic countries—was used at Falkland Palace and Edinburgh Castle, as well as in shipbuilding. Raw materials such as hides, wool, skins, herring, salmon, coal and salt were exported from the town until well into the 17thcentury.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century the suburbs of the left bank were the quickest growing areas of Rouen, in {{particular}} the communes of Sotteville (a large railway town) and Grand-Quevilly, but these towns did not have good enough public transport. Although the CTR had constructed some lines, they did not well serve residents wishing for rapid transit between the suburbs and the city centre. Line 4 of the CTR, with its central terminus at Place Beauvoisine, ran only as far as the Trianon roundabout {{at the edge of the}} Jardin des Plantes. A southern extension was planned to the Bruyères roundabout, a meeting-point of several roads to the new districts, and to the racecourse where major horse racing events took place each Thursday. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> delayed.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{transferred}} {{his residence}} from Buda to Temesvár in early 1315. Ladislaus Kán died in 1315, but his sons did not yield to Charles. Charles {{launched a campaign}} against the Kőszegis in Transdanubia and Slavonia {{in the first half}} of 1316. Local noblemen joined the royal troops, which contributed to the quick collapse of the Kőszegis' rule in southern parts of their domains. Meanwhile, James Borsa made an alliance against Charles with Ladislaus Kán's sons and other lords, including Mojs Ákos and Peter, son of Petenye. They offered the crown to Andrew of Galicia. Charles's troops, which were under the command of a former supporter of the Borsas, Dózsa Debreceni, defeated the rebels' united troops at Debrecen at the end of June. In the next two months, many fortresses of Borsa and his allies fell to the royal troops in Bihar, Szolnok, Borsod and Kolozs counties. No primary source has made reference to Charles's bravery or heroic acts, suggesting that he rarely fought in person in the battles and sieges. However, he had excellent strategic skills: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> Charles who appointed the fortresses to be besieged.|$|E
5|$|The lowest ranking Century in the Centuriate Assembly was {{the fifth}} Century (called the proletarii) of the unarmed adjunct class. This Century was the only Century {{composed}} of soldiers who had no property, and since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> the last Century to vote, it never had any real influence on elections. In 107 BC, in response to high unemployment and a severe manpower shortage in the army, the general and Consul Gaius Marius reformed {{the organization of the}} army, and allowed individuals with no property to enlist. As a consequence of these reforms, this fifth unarmed Century came to encompass almost the entire Roman army. This mass disenfranchisement of most of the soldiers in the army {{played an important role in}} the chaos that led to the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC.|$|E

5|$|The {{road was}} {{designed}} as part of Pentonville, a new suburb away from the City and became a local hub for manufacturing in the area. There was some debate over the final route of the road; the original plan to run straight through fields owned by the Skinners Company and the New River Company was rejected in favour of the route further north via Battle Bridge. As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> {{intended to be a}} main road, a coach service began in 1798 between Paddington and Bank but was quickly withdrawn. The road was turnpiked in 1830 and renamed Pentonville Road after landowner Henry Penton in 1857. Until 1882, the upkeep of the road was paid by the local parish, paying a ground rent to Penton's estate for the disused toll house at No.274.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurring}} theme in these myths is {{the effort of}} the gods to maintain maat {{against the forces of}} disorder. They fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation. Ra and Apep, battling each other each night, continue this struggle into the present. Another prominent theme is the gods' death and revival. The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris' murder, in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat. The sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky, sink into the Duat at night, and emerge as a young child at dawn. In the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of Nun, the primordial chaos. Funerary texts that depict Ra's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him. Instead of being changelessly immortal, the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation, thus renewing the whole world. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return. Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen—that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world, leaving only himself and Osiris amid the primordial chaos.|$|E
