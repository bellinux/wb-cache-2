To identify GPs' treatment responses, we exploit that specialisation in general medicine entitles the GPs to a higher consultation fee, implying a change in total and relative fee payments. To control for demand and supply factors related to becoming a specialist, we estimate a <b>GP</b> <b>fixed</b> effect model focusing on a narrow time window around the date of specialist certification. Our results show a sharp response by the GPs immediately after obtaining specialist certification and thus a higher consultation fee: the number of visits increase, while the treatment intensity (prolonged consultations, lab tests, medical procedures) decline. These {{findings are consistent with}} a theory model where (partly) profit-motivated GPs face excess demand and income effects are sufficiently small. Finally, we find no evidence for adverse health effects (measured by emergency care centre visits) on patients due to the change in GPs' treatment behaviour after becoming a specialist...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{studies have}} shown that {{seasonality}} in affective disorders exists. Even though most depressive disorders are managed exclusively by the GP, there is little population based research that has examined these seasonal influences in a primary care setting. Furthermore, {{little is known about the}} contribution of weather conditions to these seasonal variations. This study aims to examine seasonal effects on the incidence of depression in general practice. By including meteorological data in the analysis, the influence of actual weather conditions within seasons is also assessed. In the Netherlands, every patient is listed with one <b>GP</b> (<b>fixed</b> list system). We used ICPC coded electronic medical records (2001 - 2004) from a representative group of 53 to 70 GPs with, on average, 250000 patients. Meteorological data was provided by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. Preliminary results show that the relative percentage of depression (ICPC code P 76) was significantly higher in winter (1. 22 %) than in summer (1. 14 %). Remarkably, in winter, no association was found between diagnosis depression and any meteorological circumstances. The amount of light (i. e., hours of sunshine and cloudiness) showed a significant correlation in summer (R = 0. 3 - 0. 4), while the effects of temperature were most pronounced in autumn (R = 0. 3). These initial results indicate that seasonality is also present in a primary care setting, and that the weather conditions have an independent effect within the seasons. Further analyses on the exact incidences of depression will be presented. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

This suggested that broadcasting this offset to local GPS receivers could eliminate the effects of SA, resulting in measurements closer to GPS's theoretical performance, around 15 meters. Additionally, another major source of errors in a <b>GPS</b> <b>fix</b> is due to transmission delays in the ionosphere, which could also be measured and corrected for in the broadcast.

50|$|The most typical {{use of this}} {{algorithm}} {{to solve}} Lambert's problem is certainly {{for the design of}} interplanetary missions.

By comparing the initial and the final velocity vector of this heliocentric Kepler orbit with corresponding velocity vectors for the Earth and Mars a quite good estimate of the required launch energy and of the maneuvres needed for the capture at Mars can be obtained. This approach is often used in conjunction with the patched conic approximation. This is also a method for orbit determination.

50|$|Radio waves cannot {{penetrate}} water very far, so {{as soon as}} an AUV dives {{it loses}} its GPS signal. Therefore, a standard way for AUVs to navigate underwater is through dead reckoning. Navigation can however be improved by using an underwater acoustic positioning system. When operating within a net of sea floor deployed baseline transponders this is known as LBL navigation. When a surface reference such as a support ship is available, ultra-short baseline (USBL) or short-baseline (SBL) positioning is used to calculate where the sub-sea vehicle is relative to the known (GPS) position of the surface craft by means of acoustic range and bearing measurements. To improve estimation of its position, and reduce errors in dead reckoning (which grow over time), the AUV can also surface and take its own <b>GPS</b> <b>fix.</b> Between position fixes and for precise maneuvering, an Inertial Navigation System on board the AUV calculates through dead reckoning the AUV position, acceleration, and velocity. Estimates can be made using data from a Inertial Measurement Unit, and can be improved by adding a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), which measures the rate of travel over the sea/lake floor. Typically, a pressure sensor measures the vertical position (vehicle depth), although depth and altitude can also be obtained from DVL measurements. These observations are filtered to determine a final navigation solution.|$|E

This paper investigates the application of a dynamic form of GP in which the probability of crossover and mutation adapts during the GP run. This allows GP to adapt its diversitygenerating process during a run in response to feedback from the fitness function. A proof of concept study is then undertaken on the important real-world problem of options pricing. The results indicate that the dynamic form of GP yields better results than are obtained from canonical <b>GP</b> with <b>fixed</b> crossover and mutation rates.

40|$|The global {{positioning}} system (GPS) is increasingly being used to monitor animal movement and to develop more sustainable land management practices. Reliable and accurate GPS data are required to develop robust animal resource selection functions (RSFs). This study used Earth Centred Earth Fixed (ECEF) high fix rate (4 Hz) GPS data collected from Fleck™ 2 GPS collars fitted to six cows over a four-day period. The GPS data were used to derive speed and mean speed histograms. Maximum mean speed values were used to model the maximum distance travelled {{for a range of}} sample intervals. Maximum distance travelled was used to estimate the minimum area that could be predicted. To extend the methods further, we explored the use of probability density functions to describe the speed profiles; a Gamma probability density function (PDF) was shown to provide the best description. By modelling animal speeds using both the raw data and the PDF, it was possible to estimate the minimum area occupied for varying GPS sample frequencies and patch areas. Overall, the cows spent the greatest proportion (77 %) of their time either stationary or moving very slowly (less than 0. 2 m s− 1). Despite the slow speeds, the prediction errors were around 90 % for sample frequencies of greater than half an hour and a patch area of 100 m 2. If study patch areas are between 10 and 100 m 2 the <b>GPS</b> <b>fix</b> rate would need to be less than 10 s. When <b>GPS</b> <b>fix</b> intervals are recorded at 1 h intervals, the probability of accurately predicting selection within a 10 000 m 2 patch is approximately 30 %.

The aim of this laboratory study was: to determine the fluoride concentrations at the surfaces of glass-ionomer materials with respect to different storage media and different pH environments; to examine the recharge ability of the materials after NaF immersion; and to assess the morphological changes at the material surfaces using scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectroscopic techniques (SEM/EDS). Methods Five glass-ionomer materials, Fuji Triage (FT), Fuji II LC (FII), Fuji VIII (FVIII), Fuji IX <b>GP</b> (<b>FIX),</b> and Ketac N 100 (KN), were analyzed in this study. Resin-based fluoride releasing material Helioseal F (HSF) {{was used as a}} comparison material. The sample consisted of 120 cured cement disks (n = 20 disks of each tested material, 10 × 1. 5 mm). Five disks of each material were stored in 4 different storage media (I- saline, II- acidic solution ph = 2. 5, III- acid solution ph = 5. 5, IV- NaF solution (c = 500 / 106). After 7 days, two disks of each material were transferred from media I, II and III to the NaF solution for 3 min. EDS analysis was conducted in 3 randomly selected spots of each experimental disk. SEM was used to determine morphological characteristics of the material surface. Differences between the experimental groups have been analyzed using Student's t-test with the level of significance set at p Results FT showed the highest fluoride content at the surface of the material. The lowest amounts of fluoride ions were detected at the surfaces of the FT disks stored at low pH environments, and this difference was statistically significant (p FVIII>KN>FII>FIX). SEM analysis of the surface morphology revealed numerous voids, cracks and microporosities in all experimental groups, except for KN and HSF. More homogenous material structure with more discrete cracks was observed in samples stored at neutral pH environment, compared to disks stored in acidic solutions. Conclusion The tested materials could be considered as promising dental materials with potential prophylactic characteristics due to their relatively high fluoride content, but also the ability to extensively reabsorb fluoride ions, especially in acidic environments. </p...|$|R
40|$|Competition {{policy has}} played a very limited role for health care {{provision}} in Norway. The main reason is that Norway has a National Health Service (NHS) with extensive public provision and a wide set of sector-specific regulations that limit the scope for competition. However, the last two decades, several reforms have deregulated health care provision and opened up for provider competition along some dimensions. For specialised care, the government has introduced patient choice and (partly) activity (DRG) based funding, but also corporatised public hospitals and allowed for more private provision. For primary care, a reform changed the payment scheme to capitation and (a higher share of) fee-for-service, inducing almost all <b>GPs</b> on <b>fixed</b> salary contracts to become self-employed. While these reforms {{have the potential for}} generating competition in the Norwegian NHS, the empirical evidence is quite limited and the findings are mixed. We identify a set of possible caveats that may weaken the incentives for provider competition – such as the partial implementation of DRG pricing, the dual purchaser–provider role of regional health authorities, and the extensive consolidation of public hospitals – and argue that there is great scope for competition policy measures that could stimulate provider competition within the Norwegian NHS.

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess how well aerial VHF location data represented annual home range size and habitat selection compared to GPS location data collected on the same set of deer. To accomplish the study objective, first, a stationary collar test was conducted in order to establish mean VHF and GPS location error throughout the study area and quantify the influence of vegetation and terrain on VHF and GPS location error and <b>GPS</b> <b>fix</b> success rates. Second, fixed-kernel home ranges were created from each deer's VHF and GPS data. The size of each deer's VHF home range was compared to th GPS home range and the degree of similarity between utilization distributions (UD) were compared using an overlap index. Third, Euclidean distance analysis was used to compare second-order (within the study area) and third-order (within the home range) habitat selection for VHF and GPS data. The results from this study determined whether a historical sample (n = 103) of VHF data and the accuracy and intensity (number of location estimates per animal) necessary to make cogent inferences of habitat selection of southern mule deer within the study area. The stationary collar test was conducted over 14 months and resulted in a mean VHF location error of 309 - 202 m SD (n = 93) and a mean GPS location error of 10 - 11 m SD (n = 43). Placement of VHF test collars under vegetation or within the open did not influence location error.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} preliminary {{experimental results}} on small-sized {{autonomous underwater vehicle}} navigation in shallow water environments. The vehicle was chosen to be our second-generation Ocean Voyager II which has been integrated with on-board GPS/INS sensors. These first-cut results reveal practical problems when using raw <b>GP</b> S <b>fixes</b> to perform high-precision real-time navigation. Among these, the most damaging factor is the observed correlated noise (which has a long time constant and large magnitude) embedded in the GPS data. With such disturbance, one cannot distinguish between instantaneous signal and noise over a short time scale (especially with sporadic fixes), and consequently the position estimator will be greatly biased. However, with regular incoming fixes, one can process the error between dead-reckoned and GPS signal {{in order to minimize}} the influence of the correlated noise under the assumption that any drift due to sensor bias or currents is relatively time-invariant. This processing thus enables one to estimate the drift and drift rate over time reliability for post-processed vehicle localization.

The successful {{application of}} satellite technology to these little-known carnivores carries significant biological and conservation implications, and it is recommended that satellite collars are a viable technology to conduct detailed and well-designed ecological studies of Viverridae species...|$|E

However, the current techniques are open for hacking, false misrepresentation, replay and other attacks. This is {{because of the lack of}} real-time and current-precise-location in the authentication process. This paper proposes a new technique that includes freshly-generated real-time personal biometric data of the client and present-position of the mobile device used by the client to perform the mCommerce so to form a real-time biometric representation to authenticate any remote transaction. A fresh <b>GPS</b> <b>fix</b> generates the "time and location" to stamp the biometric data freshly captured to produce a single, real-time biometric representation on the mobile device. A trusted Certification Authority (CA) acts as an independent authenticator of such client's claimed real time location and his/her provided fresh biometric data. Thus eliminates the necessity of user enrolment with many mCommerce services and application providers. This CA can also "independently from the client" and "at that instant of time" collect the client's mobile device "time and location" from the cellular network operator so to compare with the received information, together with the client's stored biometric information. Finally, to preserve the client's location privacy and to eliminate the possibility of cross-application client tracking, this paper proposes shielding the real location of the mobile device used prior to submission to the CA or authenticators...|$|E
40|$|Highly dynamic {{programming}} environments for embedded real-time systems require a strict isolation of real-time threads {{from each other}} to achieve dependable systems. We propose a new real-time scheduling technique, called guaranteed percentage (GP) scheme that assigns each thread a specific percentage of the processor power. A hardware scheduler {{in conjunction with a}} multithreaded processor guarantees the execution of instructions of each thread according to their assigned percentages within a time interval of 100 processor cycles. We compare performance and implementation overhead of <b>GP</b> scheduling against <b>fixed</b> priority preemptive (FPP), earliest deadline first (EDF), and least laxity first (LLF) scheduling using several benchmarks on our Komodo microcontroller that features a multithreaded Java processor kernel. Our evaluations show that GP scheduling reaches a speed-up similar to EDF and FPP but worse than LLF. However, its hardware implementation costs are still reasonable, whereas the LLF overhead is prohibitive. Only GP reaches the isolation goal among the examined scheduling schemes...|$|R
40|$|Identifying record replicas {{in digital}} data {{repositories}} {{is a key}} step {{to improve the quality}} of content and services avail-able, as well as to yield eventual sharing efforts. Several deduplication strategies are available, but most of them rely on manually chosen settings to combine evidence used to identify records as being replicas. In this work, we present the results of experiments we have carried out with a Ma-chine Learning approach for the deduplication problem. Our approach is based on Genetic Programming (GP), that is able to automatically generate similarity functions to iden-tify record replicas in a given repository. The generated similarity functions properly combine and weight the best evidence available among the record fields in order to tell when two distinct records represent the same real-world en-tity. On a previous work, fixed similarity functions were associated to each evidence. On the present work, the GP will be also used to choose the best evidence and similar-ity functions associations. The results of the experiments show that our approach outperforms the baseline method by Fellegi and Sunter. It also outperformed the previous <b>GP</b> results, using <b>fixed</b> evidence associations when identi-fying replicas in a data set containing researcher’s personal data. 1...|$|R
40|$|Long bone {{lengthening}} {{occurs at}} the growth plate (GP) by well-regulated chondrocyte proliferation, hypertrophy and terminal matrix deposition. GP chondrocyte (GPC) hypertrophy has been implicated {{to be the main}} determinant of bone growth rate; however the mechanism is poorly understood. The work of this thesis examined some of the cellular process that drives the chondrocyte swelling or hypertrophy particularly in a mammalian post natal GPs using living in situ GPC and <b>fixed</b> <b>GP</b> tissues. Confocal scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to determine living in situ GPC volume and dimension changes in proliferative zone (PZ) through to hypertrophic zone (HZ) chondrocytes of different GPs of various bones. While PZ cells showed similar volumes and dimensions, HZ cells varied in different GPs, even within the same long bone but at opposite ends. However, the hypertrophic cell volume measured at a single post natal age (day 7) was independent of the corresponding bone length. This could reflect a complex interplay between local and systemic factors in different GPs, which occurs throughout the active phase of bone growth. Maintaining GPC morphology was critical in studying GPC hypertrophy using fixed tissues. This work highlighted a problem caused by conventional fixative solutions, which caused up to 44...|$|R
