The words were these, [...] "That those Lords who had put up the petition to his Majestye were a company of Puritan rascalls, base fellows and base scabbs." [...] The name {{of the man who}} spoke thus is Francis Rowley. They were spoken in the house of Francis Saunders, vintner in Whitchurch. He hath been also heard {{to say that it is}} a better deed to kill one of our religion than to give a hungry man a meal's meat, who is ready to starve. This Rowley lives in Whitchurch. If this man were apprehended and the words examined by some careful Justices of the Peace <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be proved.|$|E

Neefit mère is worse than the father,--being cross and ill-conditioned, as far as I can see. Polly {{is as good as}} gold; and if I put a house over my head with her money, of course her father and her mother will be made welcome there.

"Some {{time since}} there fell into my hands, to my great joy, about [...] twenty-three sheets in thy own handwriting, {{containing}} an account [...] of the parentage and life of thyself, directed to thy son, ending [...] {{in the year}} 1730, with which there were notes, likewise in thy [...] writing; a copy of which I enclose, in hopes {{it may be a}} means, if [...] thou continued it up to a later period, that the first and latter [...] part may be put together; and if it is not yet continued, I hope [...] thee will not delay it. Life is uncertain, as the preacher tells [...] us; and what will the world say, if kind, humane, and benevolent [...] Ben Franklin should leave his friends and the world deprived of so [...] pleasing and profitable a work; a work which would be useful and [...] entertaining not only to a few, but to millions? The influence [...] writings under that class have on the minds of youth is very great, [...] and has nowhere appeared to me so plain as in our public friend's [...] journals. It almost insensibly leads the youth into the resolution [...] of endeavouring to become as good and eminent as the journalist. [...] Should thine, for instance, when published (and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> [...] not fail of it), lead the youth to equal the industry and [...] temperance of thy early youth, what a blessing with that class [...] would such a work be! I know of no character living, nor many of [...] them put together, who has so much in his power as thyself to [...] promote a greater spirit of industry and early attention to [...] business, frugality, and temperance, with the American youth.

6000|$|Among the Patagonian Indians in the Strait of Magellan, {{we found}} a half Indian, who had lived some years with the tribe, but {{had been born in}} the {{northern}} provinces. I asked him if he had ever heard of the Avestruz Petise. He answered by saying, [...] "Why, there are none others in these southern countries." [...] He informed me that the number of eggs in the nest of the petise is considerably less than in that of the other kind, namely, not more than fifteen on an average, but he asserted that more than one female deposited them. At Santa Cruz we saw several of these birds. They were excessively wary: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> see a person approaching when too far off to be distinguished themselves. In ascending the river few were seen; but in our quiet and rapid descent many, in pairs and by fours or fives, were observed. It was remarked that this bird did not expand its wings, when first starting at full speed, after the manner of the northern kind. In conclusion I may observe that the Struthio rhea inhabits the country of La Plata as far as a little south of the Rio Negro in latitude 41 degrees, and that the Struthio Darwinii takes its place in Southern Patagonia; the part about the Rio Negro being neutral territory. M. A. d'Orbigny, when at the Rio Negro, made great exertions to procure this bird, but never {{had the good fortune to}} succeed. (5/16. When at the Rio Negro, we heard much of the indefatigable labours of this naturalist. M. Alcide d'Orbigny, during the years 1825 to 1833, traversed several large portions of South America, and has made a collection, and is now publishing the results on a scale of magnificence, which at once places himself in the list of American travellers second only to Humboldt.) Dobrizhoffer long ago was aware of there being two kinds of ostriches, he says, [...] "You must know, moreover, that Emus differ in size and habits in different tracts of land; for those that inhabit the plains of Buenos Ayres and Tucuman are larger, and have black, white and grey feathers; those near to the Strait of Magellan are smaller and more beautiful, for their white feathers are tipped with black at the extremity, and their black ones in like manner terminate in white."

5000|$|However, Brian Paddick, {{a former}} deputy {{assistant}} commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, claimed that there were not enough officers [...] "in {{the right place at}} the right time" [...] and suggested intelligence had not been heeded. He told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: [...] "It appears to me that they just didn't have the right numbers of officers in {{the right place at the}} right time to prevent not only the problems at Fortnum & Mason but at Trafalgar Square.

5000|$|Romero {{also made}} an {{extensive}} use of computer-generated imagery because it allowed him to shoot the film quickly and add the effects later. Also, the film's style, as if shot with hand-held cameras, necessitated a shift from his usual method of working, which involves filming multiple camera angles and assembling scenes in the editing room. Instead, Romero filmed much of the action in long, continuous takes: [...] "The camera was 360, so everybody was an acrobat, ducking under the lens when the camera came past you," [...] said Romero. [...] "The cast was great. They {{had a lot of}} theater experience. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have gone from scene one {{all the way to the}} end of the movie, all in a single shot." ...|$|E

5000|$|In February 1978, Dylan {{initiated}} a ten-month World Tour {{that consisted of}} 114 concerts in ten countries. On June 15, Dylan released the album Street-Legal, which received poor reviews from most American critics. Performances on his world tour also received negative reviews. The physical demands of touring were also taking a toll on the artist. During a concert on November 17 in San Diego, someone from the audience threw a small silver cross on stage. Dylan later recalled in a 1979 interview: [...] Towards {{the end of the}} show someone out in the crowd ... knew I wasn't feeling too well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> see that. And they threw a silver cross on the stage. Now usually I don't pick things up in front of the stage ... But I looked down at that cross. I said, 'I gotta pick that up.' So I picked up the cross and I put it in my pocket ... And I brought it backstage and I brought it with me to the next town, which was out in Arizona ... I was feeling even worse than I'd felt when I was in San Diego. I said, 'Well, I need something tonight.' I didn't know what it was. I was used to all kinds of things. I said, 'I need something tonight that I didn't have before.' And I looked in my pocket and I had this cross.|$|E
5000|$|I don't {{think it}} can be done. In part because of the human tendency, for most people, there are exceptions, to take {{the path of least resistance}}. They'll take the easy way out, and giving up your car, your {{television}} set, your electricity, is not the path of least resistance for most people. As I see it, I don't think there is any controlled or planned way in which we can dismantle the industrial system. I think that the only way we will get rid of it is if it breaks down and collapses... The big problem is that people don't believe a revolution is possible, and it is not possible precisely because they do not believe it is possible. To a large extent I think the eco-anarchist movement is accomplishing a great deal, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> do it better... The real revolutionaries should separate themselves from the reformers... And I think that it would be good if a conscious effort was being made to get as many people as possible introduced to the wilderness. In a general way, I think what has to be done is not to try and convince or persuade the majority of people that we are right, as much as try to increase tensions in society to the point where things start to break down. To create a situation where people get uncomfortable enough that they're going to rebel. So the question is how do you increase those tensions? ...|$|E

[...] Discipline later said that he wants Tyler to marry Whitney. He told Soaplife that the two characters have the [...] "potential for a strong future together". He commented: [...] "Once they finally get together and everyone's accepted it for what it is and they're left alone, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> go really far." [...] Asked whether if a wedding is possible, he replied: [...] "I hope so! Their characters would have a big East End wedding. Maybe they'd get Tyler's dad Eddie back from Spain." [...] Viewers will see Tyler get back together with Whitney. Speaking of the plot development, Discipline added: [...] "Lucy starts meddling and tells Tyler that Fat Boy is going to propose to Whitney on Valentine's Day. They're at R&R and Tyler feels he has to tell her not to do it, and reveals his feelings for her. But she tells him it's too late. He's really hurt. He knows what he feels about Whitney, and he knows he wants to be there for her, but he can't put it into the right words. This is all new to Tyler. He's never found a girl that he really wants to be with like this." [...] McGarty said that the plot with Tyler and Whitney is [...] "weird".|$|E

30|$|During the interview, each teacher-rater {{was asked}} to {{describe}} the reasons behind the rating changes or the reason not to change (Table  3). Eunice, commented that the Rubric deals with fresh ideas and the author’s voice, which she did not consider much when rating without a rubric. When asked to provide reasons for any changes in her ratings, Eunice stated {{that she did not}} initially consider the strength of ideas as an important criterion in her initial rating for short EFL descriptive essays. She thought the reason may have been due to different amounts of attention given to specific grammar points when she described a specific essay to which she had made rating changes. Eunice stated, “[In my first rating], I was paying {{a lot of attention to}} the run-on sentences. With this [the Rubric], I was more interested in support. If the details were appropriately developed, even though the sentences were run-on, [it was okay]. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have been fixed pretty easily.” Eunice thought her ratings increased because she focused on the idea or support of the idea rather than on other sentence-level concerns, such as sentence variety. “I think [I am more generous] because of the ideas and details. I was trying to see the author’s voice, less on parts of speech or capitalization,” she explained.|$|E
40|$|An {{environmental}} impact survey of property on the Riverside County Airport at Thermal, California, has recently revealed {{the remains of}} a major Desert Cahuilla village. Instead of the ethnographic summary drawn from published sources which usually accompanies {{environmental impact}} reports, it was decided to undertake an ethnohistorical investigation of the site. This paper represents a collaboration between the authors aimed at providing a brief ethnography of the village of Temal Wakhish on the Thermal Airport property. (For an explanation of English and Cahuilla placenames in the Coachella Valley, see Table 1.) The data presented here were obtained from a review of ethnographic sources, the junior author's extensive knowledge of oral history of the village and the surrounding area, and {{as the result of a}} walkover survey of the site. We hope this paper will demonstrate the value of collaboration between Native Americans and anthropologists. Archaeologists sometimes pass up a potentially valuable source of data in interpreting the archaeological record by ignoring living Native Americans. Ethnohistorical investigations of the sort presented here not only permit more detailed inferences in interpreting archaeological remains, but also preserve important ethnographic data that might otherwise be lost. Such a collaboration may also reduce the mistrust many Native Americans have for the motives behind archaeological research and environmental impact surveys. As Mrs. Modesto puts it: Archaeologists dig things up and don't tell people anything and carry them away sometimes. This is the reason people don't want archaeologists to come to the reservations. They don't want them because they don't tell the people anything. They just come and dig. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get along much better. Probably there are still many people yet that know the old history and they could talk to the archaeologists. That way the archaeologists could get to know the Indian better. I have myself seen desecrated graves, bones scattered everywhere, and this is terrible; a sacrilege. If the archaeologists would only come and speak to the people it would be better...|$|E
