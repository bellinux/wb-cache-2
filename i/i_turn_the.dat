500|$|No [...] "John Doe #2" [...] {{was ever}} identified, nothing {{conclusive}} was ever reported regarding {{the owner of}} the unmatched leg, and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing. Although the defense teams in both McVeigh's and Nichols trials suggested that others were involved, Judge Steven W. Taylor found no credible, relevant, or legally admissible evidence, of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing. When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: [...] "You can't handle the truth! Because the truth is, I blew up the Murrah Building, and isn't it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell?" [...] On the morning of McVeigh's execution a letter was released in which he had written [...] "For those die-hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this, <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> tables and say: Show me where I needed anyone else. Financing? Logistics? Specialized tech skills? Brainpower? Strategy? ... Show me where I needed a dark, mysterious 'Mr. X'!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "We Belong Together" [...] is an R ballad. Rolling Stone {{called it}} [...] "soulful." [...] The song is {{propelled}} by a programmed Roland TR-808-styled kick and hi-hat, which is prominently utilized in hip hop music. Reviewer Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News commented that Carey's spare and understated singing approach gave the song more power, {{which would not}} have been achieved if she had belted. The song also incorporates 1980s retro-soul music by [...] "cleverly" [...] referencing Bobby Womack's [...] "If You Think You're Lonely Now" [...] (1981) and the Deele's [...] "Two Occasions" [...] (1987), with Babyface. In the second verse of [...] "We Belong Together", Carey sings: [...] "Bobby Womack's on the radio / Singing to me, 'If you think you're lonely now'." [...] She then flips across a radio dial: [...] "So <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> dial, tryinâ€™ to catch a break / And then I hear Babyface / 'I only think of you...'." [...] The line [...] "If you think you're lonely now" [...] is from the song of the same name and [...] "I only think of you" [...] is from the chorus of [...] "Two Occasions." [...] In the remix she also says [...] "I only think of you / On two occasions / That's day and night..." [...] Due to the inclusion of the lyrics from both songs, the songwriters were given co-writing credits on the song. [...] "We Belong Together" [...] follows the common verse-chorus form and is structured into three distinct sections, with each section presenting the protagonist in different emotions. The first section chronicles the break-up of the couple, and a sorrowful tone is established as she laments her former mistakes. In the second section, the narrative switches to the present, and the protagonist becomes increasingly agitated and feels [...] "all out of her element" [...] when she attempts to distract herself by listening to the radio, but fails. [...] "We Belong Together" [...] does not have a bridge; instead, Carey transitions into the third section by raising the pitch an octave, which emphasizes the sheer frustration and desperation of the protagonist. Metro Times writer Johnny Loftus described the song's production, lyrics and vocals in detail: ...|$|E
