50|$|Inulin {{is often}} {{combined}} with erythritol because of inulin's offering a complementary negative {{heat of solution}} (exothermic, or warming effect when dissolved, which helps cancel erythritol's cooling effect) and noncrystallizing properties. However, inulin has a propensity to cause gas and bloating in those having consumed it in moderate to large quantities, in particular in individuals unaccustomed to it. Other sugar alcohols are sometimes used with erythritol, in particular <b>isomalt,</b> because of its minimally positive heat of solution, and glycerin, which has a negative heat of solution, moderate hygroscopicity, and noncrystallizing liquid form.|$|E
50|$|Sugar alcohols, a {{class of}} polyols, are {{commonly}} added to foods because of their lower caloric content than sugars; however, they are also, in general, less sweet, and are often combined with high-intensity sweeteners.

40|$|Background: Although polyols are {{frequently}} used as tablet excipients in lozenges, chewing tablets, and orodisperse tablets, special directly compressible (DC) forms are recommended as filler-binder in common disintegrating tablets. Aim: In this article, DC types of <b>isomalt,</b> lactitol, mannitol, sorbitol and xylitol are evaluated. Method: Tablets of both lubricated and unlubricated DC polyols and theophylline tablets were compressed at different forces using a compaction simulator or a motorized hydraulic press. Disintegration times (without disks) and dissolution rate were measured according to Ph. Eur. Results: Compaction profiles {{show that the}} DC forms of <b>isomalt,</b> mannitol and sorbitol have sufficient compactibility and a low lubricant sensitivity. The crushing strengths of tablets, prepared from DC lactitol and xylitol, are too low for practical use. Because of their reduced hygroscopicity and smaller capping tendency as compared with DC sorbitol, DC types of <b>isomalt</b> and mannitol {{seem to be the}} most convenient filler-binders. Because of their high water solubility, tablets prepared from polyols erode rather than disintegrate. Tablet formulations with theophylline as a test drug and DC <b>isomalt</b> or DC mannitol as filler-binder show that both products have their own limitations: DC mannitol gives more adhesion problems than DC <b>isomalt.</b> On the other hand, the disintegration time and drug dissolution rate for tablets containing DC mannitol is faster than for tablets containing DC <b>isomalt.</b> Conclusions: Of the DC polyols investigated, both DC <b>isomalt</b> and DC mannitol are the most suitable filler-binders for disintegrating tablets, prepared by direct compaction...|$|E

Particle size distribution and flowability of the granules and friability and disintegration time of the tablets are determined. Tensile strength of tablets is related to the specific compaction force during roll compaction and the tableting force. In all cases, the tensile strength increases with raising tableting forces. The specific compaction force has a different influence. For <b>isomalt</b> alone the tensile strength is highest for tablets made from granules prepared at 2 kN/cm and 6 kN/cm and decreases at higher values, i. e., &gt; 10 kN/cm.

40|$|Although {{other polyols}} have been {{described}} extensively as filler-binders in direct compaction of tablets, the polyol <b>isomalt</b> is rather unknown as pharmaceutical excipient, {{in spite of its}} description in all the main pharmacopoeias. In this paper the compaction properties of different types of ispomalt were studied. The types used were the standard product sieved <b>isomalt,</b> milled <b>isomalt</b> and two types of agglomerated <b>isomalt</b> with a different ratio between 6 -O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-D-sorbitol (GPS) and 1 -O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannitol dihydrate (GPM). Powder flow properties, specific Surface area and densities of the different types were investigated. Compactibility was investigated by compression of the tablets on a compaction Simulator, simulating the compression oil high-speed tabletting machines. Lubricant sensitivity was measured by compressing unlubricated tablets and tablets lubricated with 1 % magnesium stearate oil all instrumented hydraulic press. Sieved isomair had excellent flow properties but the compactibility was found to be poor whereas the lubricant sensitivity was high. Milling resulted in both a strong increase in compactibility as an effect of the higher surface area for bonding and a decrease in lubricant sensitivity as an effect of the higher Surface area to be coated with magnesium stearate. However, the flow properties of milled <b>isomalt</b> were too bad for use as filler-binder in direct compaction. just as could be expected, agglomeration of milled <b>isomalt</b> by fluid bed agglomeration improved flowability. The good compaction properties and the low lubricant sensitivity were maintained. This effect is Caused by all early fragmentation of the agglomerated material during the compaction process, producing clean, lubricant-free particles and a high Surface for bonding.

Design: Both studies were randomised, double-blind, cross-over designs. Subjects: Fifty-one children aged 6 - 9 y were recruited from primary schools in the Salford area of Greater Manchester. Forty-eight children completed the study. Fifty healthy adult volunteers aged 18 - 24 y were recruited from the student population of the University of Salford. All subjects completed the study. Interventions: Children consumed either 25 g of sucrose, <b>isomalt</b> or lycasin HBC and adults 25 and 40 g in hard boiled sweets per day for two consecutive test days. Test periods of 2 days were separated by 7 day washout periods. Children consumed sweets throughout test days and adults in no less than 30 min {{but no more than}} 90 min. Subjects reported the prevalence and magnitude of flatulence, borborygmi, bloating, colic, bowel movements and watery faeces. Results: Consumption of 25 g <b>isomalt</b> provoked a mild laxative effect in children but not in adults. Consumption of 25 g <b>isomalt</b> significantly increased the prevalence and magnitude of gastrointestinal responses in both children and adults.

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Qualidade e Segurança Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{prevalence}} of {{diseases such as}} diabetes mellitus and obesity has led to demand for alternative, low caloric foods traditionally high in sucrose and/or fat, such as chocolate. The aim of this work was to {{study the effects of}} the substitution of sucrose by the intense sweeteners rebaudioside-A and sucralose and its association with the bulking agents polydextrose, inulin and <b>isomalt</b> on physical and sensory properties of chocolate. Chocolate masses prepared in the laboratory were compared to physical and sensory. The physical examination consisted in studying the rheological behavior (through scans of tension, frequency, deformation velocity and temperature) and texture profile of the masses. The chocolates were subjected to descriptive sensory analysis by a panel of thirteen semi-trained tasters. These studies were preceded by a preliminary study of sensory characterization of commercial chocolates made with different types of sweeteners. From the results obtained in the rheological tests, it was concluded that the bulking agent leading to features closer to the chocolate made in the laboratory with sucrose (Standard) and / or its corresponding commercial, is <b>isomalt</b> because is to present an internal structure, elastic component (G ') and viscous (G'') similar to these chocolates, but also for having close values of viscosity in the range of deformation velocity tested (0. 2 to 200 s- 1) indicating that this agent body provides an internal structure similar to sucrose. In chocolates made with polydextrose, G' is always lower than G'', in other words, it is more fluid and have a more fragile structure. From the results of texture analysis, we conclude, however, that polydextrose is the agent bulking agent that leads to a texture profile closer to the standard chocolate. However, when compared with the commercial chocolate, <b>isomalt</b> is the one that has an internal structure more similar to it. Despite these observations, we found no significant differences in hardness values of all the chocolates made. The results of sensory analysis showed that <b>isomalt</b> chocolate gives greater sweetness and softens the bitterness, and that polydextrose does not affect the characteristics, like bitterness and astringency, transmitted by the other ingredients. The rebaudioside A has a higher sweetening power but causes feelings of bitterness, although it is strongly attenuated when used together with <b>isomalt.</b> The chocolates made with sucralose and <b>isomalt</b> were preferred by tasters because they are sweeter, but unlike the previous ones, showed clear differences with regard to chocolate made with sucrose. It was concluded that the association of the <b>isomalt</b> and rebaudioside-A is potentially interesting in terms of physical and sensory characteristics, as it could be an excellent solution to enjoy the high sweetness of a natural sweetener with no noticeable unpleasant sensory effects, justifying therefore, the continuation of this study in future...|$|E

The endurance test was maximal incremental cycling test in which maximal power, maximal blood lactate, maximal heart rate, maximal ventilation, VO 2 max as well as RPE and glucose concentration at exhaustion were determined. The strength tests were maximal isometric leg press and vertical counter-movement jump. The {{results of the present study}} showed that the Bergenia supplementation with the current doses of 100 – 400 mg does not have almost any acute or a 7 -day usage effect on endurance and maximal force characteristics in physically active men. Bergenia supplementation did not cause any negative effects on the present subjects either. In the previous studies it was shown that supplementation of animals with the extract from fermented leaves of Bergenia enhanced the maximum swimming capacity of mice. We may make a hypothesis that probably other dose ranges and prolongation of supplementation time would be more correct for future human experiments. 201...|$|E
40|$|The {{bioavailability}} of hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) from moulded isomalt-based tablets {{was evaluated}} after oral administration of 50 mg HCT to healthy volunteers as an oral moulded tablet {{and as a}} lozenge, in comparison with a conventional tablet formulation (Dichlotride 50 mg). Moulded tablets had a high relative bioavailability (F(rel)) as the pharmacokinetic parameters (C(max), t(max), t(1 / 2), AUC(0 [...] > 24 h)) determined from HCT plasma concentration versus time profiles {{were not significantly different}} (P> 0. 05; two-way ANOVA) in comparison with the conventional tablet. The relative bioavailability of the moulded tablet administered as a lozenge and as an oral tablet was 106. 2 +/- 30. 9 % and 89. 4 +/- 25. 9 %, respectively, in relation to the conventional tablet formulation. Direct moulding of <b>isomalt</b> tablets proved to be a suitable technique to administer a poorly soluble drug either as a conventional tablet or as a lozenge. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to examine the effects of}} sugar substitutes on the gut microbiome. Methods: PUBMED was used to find articles that studied the gut microbiome after consumption of a sugar substitute in humans. Both observational and interventional studies were selected for this review. Results: Starting with 31 articles found on PUBMED, 5 articles were included to be reviewed after 26 articles were excluded. Three natural sugar substitutes and four categories of artificial sweeteners were studied. Maltitol, lactitol, and <b>isomalt</b> were the natural sugar substitutes, and aspartame, acesulfame-K, non-caloric artificial sweeteners, and saccharin were the artificial sweeteners. The outcomes for Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Lactobacilli, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, and Enterobacteriaceae were addressed. Natural sugar substitutes were seen to increase bacterial populations that are believed to be beneficial to humans while artificial sweeteners established bacterial populations that are considered harmful to health. Conclusions: The studies examined suggest cautious use of artificial sweeteners due to its effects on the gut microbiome while natural sugar substitutes could have potential health benefit...|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the studies of isomaltulose obtainment, due to its physicochemical properties and physiological health benefits. These properties, which include low cariogenicity, low glycemic index and greater stability, allow the use of this sweetener as a substitute for sucrose in foods; besides the fact that it can be converted to <b>isomalt,</b> a dietary non-cariogenic sugar alcohol used in pharmaceuticals {{as well as in the}} food industry. Isomaltulose (6 -O-&# 945;-D-glucopyronosyl- 1 - 6 -D-fructofuranose) is a disaccharide reducer obtained by the enzymatic conversion of sucrose - the &# 945;-glucosyltransferase enzyme. Different treatments were performed for the preparation of whole cells; lysed cells; and crude enzyme extract of Erwinia sp. D 12 strain immobilized in calcium alginate. The packed bed column of granules, containing Erwinia sp. cells sonicated and immobilized in calcium alginate (CSI), reached a maximum conversion of 53 - 59 % sucrose into isomaltulose and it presented activity for 480 hours. The converted syrup was purified and the isomaltulose crystallization was performed through the lowering of temperature. The isomaltulose crystals presented purity of 96. 5 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of the pellet core materials <b>isomalt,</b> sugar, and microcrystalline cellulose on the in vitro drug release kinetics of coated sustained-release pellets as well as to evaluate the influence of different ratios of polymethacrylate copolymers exhibiting different permeability characteristics on the drug release rate. For characterization of the drug release process of pellets, the effect of osmolality was studied using glucose as an osmotically active agent in the dissolution medium. The pellet cores were layered with diclofenac sodium as model drug and coated with different ratios of Eudragit® RS 30 D and Eudragit® RL 30 D (ERS and ERL; 0 : 1 and 0. 5 : 0. 5 and 1 : 0 ratio) in a fluid bed apparatus. Physical characteristics such as mechanical strength, shape, and size proved that the inert cores were adequate for further processing. The in vitro dissolution tests were performed using a USP Apparatus I (basket method). The results demonstrated that, besides the ratio of the coating polymers (ERS/ERL), the release mechanism was also influenced by the type of starter core used. Sugar- and isomalt-type pellet cores demonstrated similar drug release profiles...|$|E
40|$|A NADH-dependent {{mannitol}} dehydrogenase gene (mtlD) was cloned from Pseudomonas fluorescens, subcloned into {{an expression}} vector (pDEST 110) and entered into different strains of E. coli to compare their protein expression and the enzyme specific activity. Purifications were accomplished by Ni 2 + -NTA affinity chromatography. Using this approach, {{the efficiency of}} purification process significantly increased (up to 90 %) so that the purified enzyme gave a sharp single band (55 kDa) in SDS-PAGE. The results showed that among the strains, BL 21 (DE 3) plysS exhibited the maximum expression level of MDH(mannitol dehydrogenase) (11 mg L - 1). Results from activity assay with fructose as substrate also showed that in this strain the specific activity of 63 U mg - 1 protein monitored for the enzyme, the record not reported before. Resazurin staining also indicated that the enzyme reduced fructose, whereas oxidized other substrates including mannitol, sorbitol and arabitol under optimal assay condition. From HPLC analysis it was showed {{for the first time}} that the enzyme could convert substrate isomaltulose to the specific products, GPM and GPS. Interestingly, because of the high specificity of the enzyme for substrate, the method can be used as an alternative approach to substitute non-specific conventional method of <b>isomalt</b> production...|$|E
