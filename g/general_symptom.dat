5000|$|In the theory, [...] "availability" [...] {{is defined}} as the {{tendency}} to judge the likelihood of explanation for an event by the ease with which relevant examples come to mind. In a clinical situation a diagnosis may be made because the physician often sees similar cases in his practice — for example, the misclassification of aspirin toxicity as a viral pneumonia, or the improper recognition of an essential tremor as delirium tremens due to alcohol withdrawal in an indigent urban setting. Groopman argues that a clinician will misattribute a <b>general</b> <b>symptom</b> as specific to a certain disease based on the frequency he encounters that disease in his practice.|$|E

The validation of electronic patient-reported outcome devices requires information on patient preference and ease of use. This study conducted usability testing for a <b>General</b> <b>Symptom</b> Questionnaire and Medication Module™ on a handheld device for subjects with osteoarthritis (OA) to determine whether subjects can report on their symptoms and medication use using an electronic diary. Methods: Nine subjects with OA participating in a large US mode equivalency study were surveyed independently in this study. Subjects completed a <b>General</b> <b>Symptom</b> Questionnaire and Medication Module™ using the LogPad® LW handheld device. Demographic and technology use information was collected, and the subjects were queried on device usability. Results: Subjects reported that the handheld device was {{easy to use and}} {{that they were able to}} complete a <b>General</b> <b>Symptom</b> Questionnaire and Medication Module™ with little or no assistance. They did not report any issues with the screen or size of the device. Subjects were willing to travel with the device to complete electronic diaries at home or in public. Participants indicated that they would be able to use the handheld device to answer questions during a clinical trial. Subjects with OA experienced no physical discomfort during completion of either questionnaire. Conclusion: The <b>General</b> <b>Symptom</b> Questionnaire and Medication Module™ were usable and acceptable to subjects with OA on a handheld device. This was consistent regardless of previous experience and confidence with technology, despite the potential physical restrictions for an OA cohort.

40|$|Objective. Little {{is known}} about {{predictors}} of treatment duration and premature termination of psychotherapy. Method. Sociodemographic variables, descriptive DSM-IV psychiatric diagnoses, <b>general</b> <b>symptom</b> severity, and psychodynamic personality functioning were assessed in 148 inpatients with personality disorders who were receiving psychotherapy. Psychodynamic personality functioning was assessed using the Developmental Profile (DP). Predictive performance and incremental value over and beyond demographics and descriptive diagnoses were determined. Results. In contrast to DSM-IV diagnoses and symptom severity, psychodynamic variables {{and the level of}} personality functioning significantly predicted treatment duration and premature treatment termination. Longer treatment duration was predicted by adaptive DP levels of personality functioning, whereas shorter treatment duration was associated with maladaptive personality functioning (primitive DP levels, including fragmentation and self-centeredness). DP variables independently explained 6 % of the variance. Conclusion. In contrast to DSM-IV diagnoses and <b>general</b> <b>symptom</b> severity, psychodynamic personality variables significantly predicted treatment duration and premature discharge. These findings support the relevance of psychodynamic assessments in clinical practice, the DSM- 5 proposals for the definition of personality functioning, and the predictive validity of the DP.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} suicide probability in Iranian males with substance abuse or dependence disorder and to investigate the predictors of suicide probability based on trait mindfulness, reasons for living and severity of general psychiatric symptoms. Participants were 324 individuals with substance abuse or dependence in an outpatient setting and prison. Reasons for living questionnaire, Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale and Suicide probability Scale were used as instruments. Sample was selected based on convenience sampling method. Data were analyzed using SPSS and AMOS. The life-time prevalence of suicide attempt in the outpatient setting was 35 % and it was 42 % in the prison setting. Suicide probability in the prison setting was significantly higher than in the outpatient setting (p< 0. 001). The severity of <b>general</b> <b>symptom</b> strongly correlated with suicide probability. Trait mindfulness, not reasons for living beliefs, had a mediating effect in the relationship between the severity of general symptoms and suicide probability. Fear of social disapproval, survival and coping beliefs and child-related concerns significantly predicted suicide probability (p< 0. 001). It could be suggested that trait mindfulness was more effective in preventing suicide probability than beliefs about reasons for living in individuals with substance abuse or dependence disorders.
