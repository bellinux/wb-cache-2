A French governor-general (toàn quyền) in Hanoi administered all the five parts of Indochina (Tonkin, Annam, Cochinchina, Laos, and Cambodia.) while Cochinchina (Nam Kỳ) was under a French governor (thống đốc), but the difference from the other parts was that most <b>indegenous</b> intellensia and wealthy were naturalized French (Tourane of Đà Nẵng in the central third of Vietnam also enjoyed this privilege because this city was a concession too.)

Between Tonkin {{in the north and}} Cochinchina in the south was the protectorate (xứ bảo hộ) of Annam (Trung Kỳ), under a French resident superior (khâm sứ). A Vietnamese emperor, Bảo Đại, residing in Huế, was the nominal ruler of Annam and Tonkin, which had parallel French and Vietnamese systems of administration, but his influence was less in Tonkin than in Annam. Cochinchina had been annexed by France in 1862 and even elected a deputy to the French National Assembly. It was more [...] "evolved", and French interests were stronger than in other parts of Indochina, notably in the form of French-owned rubber plantations. During World War II, Indochina was administered by Vichy France and occupied by Japan. Japanese troops overthrew the French administration on 9 March 1945, Emperor Bảo Đại proclaimed Vietnam independent. When the Japanese surrendered in 1945, Emperor Bảo Đại abdicated, and Viet Minh leader Hồ Chí Minh proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) in Hanoi and the DRV controlled almost the entire country of Vietnam. In June 1946, France declared Cochinchina a republic, separate from the northern and central parts. A victorious Chinese communist army arrived in Vietnam's northern part of parallel 17. Hồ purged non-communist politicians from the DRV. The French Indochina War began on 19 December 1946, with the French regaining control of Hanoi and many other cities.|$|E
5000|$|Biafra, officially the Republic of Biafra, is a secessionist {{state in}} eastern Nigeria {{that is made}} up of the States in the Old Eastern Region. Its first attempt to leave Nigeria {{resulted}} in the Nigeria/Biafra war from 30 May 1967 to January 1970. It took its name from the Bight of Biafra, the Atlantic bay to its south, on the east end of the Gulf of Guinea. The inhabitants are mostly the Igbo people who led the secession due to economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions among the various peoples of Nigeria. Other ethnic groups that constitute the republic are the Efik, Ibibio, Annang, Ejagham, Eket, Ibeno and the Ijaw among others. The secession of the Biafran region was caused by the pogrom that was committed against the Igbo and other Biafrans living in the North in revenge of what the northerners termed the assassination of northern leaders by a group of young soldiers lead by Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu, an Igbo, in Nigerias first military coup early on 15 January 1966 which was followed by another coup that resulted in the death of the new head of state Major Gen JTU Aguiyi-Ironsi, also an Igbo, the same year. The state was formally recognised by Gabon, Haiti, Ivory Coast, Tanzania and Zambia. Other nations which did not give official recognition, but provided support and assistance to Biafra included Israel, France, Spain, Portugal, Norway, Rhodesia, South Africa and the Vatican City. Today a new struggle for Biafra independence is is being championed by a mass movement, the <b>Indegenous</b> People of Biafra (IPOB) led by Nnamdi Kanu and his London based colleagues from where they run Radio Biafra and Biafra Television. The movement has grown so rapidly that it has a massive followership at home and abroad made up of Biafrans in diaspora in nearly every country in the world. International Human Rights Organisations like the Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch have corroborated IPOB and its sister organisation Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB)s accusations of extrajudicial killings by the Nigerian Army and the Police of their members, in their reports.
