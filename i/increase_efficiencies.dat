2500|$|The {{tendency}} of N2O4 to reversibly break into NO2 {{has led to}} research into its use in advanced power generation systems as a so-called dissociating gas. [...] "Cool" [...] dinitrogen tetroxide is compressed and heated, causing it to dissociate into nitrogen dioxide at half the molecular weight. [...] This hot nitrogen dioxide is expanded through a turbine, cooling it and lowering the pressure, and then cooled further in a heat sink, causing it to recombine into nitrogen tetroxide at the original molecular weight. [...] It is then much easier to compress to start the entire cycle again. [...] Such dissociative gas Brayton cycles {{have the potential to}} considerably <b>increase</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of power conversion equipment.|$|E
2500|$|As {{discussed}} earlier, {{being able}} to concentrate and scatter light {{across the surface of}} the plasmonic solar cell will help to <b>increase</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> [...] Recently, research at Sandia National Laboratories has discovered a photonic waveguide which collects light at a certain wavelength and traps it within the structure. [...] This new structure can contain 95% of the light that enters it compared to 30% for other traditional waveguides. [...] It can also direct the light within one wavelength which is ten times greater than traditional waveguides. [...] The wavelength this device captures can be selected by changing the structure of the lattice which comprises the structure. [...] If this structure is used to trap light and keep it in the structure until the solar cell can absorb it, the efficiency of the solar cell could be increased dramatically.|$|E

50|$|Light {{concentrators}} <b>increase</b> <b>efficiencies</b> {{and reduce}} the cost/efficiency ratio. The three types of light concentrators in use are refractive lenses like Fresnel lenses, reflective dishes (parabolic or cassegraine), and light guide optics. Thanks to these devices, light arriving on a large surface can be concentrated on a smaller cell. The intensity concentration ratio (or “suns”) is the average intensity of the focused light divided by 1 kW/m² (reasonable value related to solar constant). If its value is X then the MJ current becomes X higher under concentrated illumination.|$|E

This integration is grounded in Sasol’s 60 years experience in synthetic fuels production. The liquid fuels produced through its GTL and CTL technologies are high-performance, low-emission products. The synthetic GTL-based diesel is an environmentally cleaner burning fuel as it leads {{to a reduction in}} carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon and particulate matter without compromising NOx emissions even when compared to European sulfur-free diesel.|$|E

The allocation of an additional 20,000 residents at the discretion of Simcoe County under the amended Growth Plan has sparked further concern that the Simcoe Sub-area amendment favours development interests at the expense of environmental security and smart growth.
