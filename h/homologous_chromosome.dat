25|$|To {{understand}} the DNA damage theory of aging {{it is important}} to distinguish between DNA damage and mutation, the two major types of errors that occur in DNA. Damage and mutation are fundamentally different. DNA damage is any physical abnormality in the DNA, such as single and double strand breaks, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine residues and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adducts. DNA damage can be recognized by enzymes, and thus can be correctly repaired using the complementary undamaged sequence in a <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> if it is available for copying. If a cell retains DNA damage, transcription of a gene can be prevented and thus translation into a protein will also be blocked. Replication may also be blocked and/or the cell may die. Descriptions of reduced function, characteristic of aging and associated with accumulation of DNA damage, are given later in this article.|$|E
25|$|Autopolyploids possess {{at least}} three <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> sets, {{which can lead to}} high rates of {{multivalent}} pairing during meiosis (particularly in recently formed autopolyploids, a.k.a. neopolyploids) and an associated decrease in fertility due to the production of aneuploid gametes. Natural or artificial selection for fertility can quickly stabilize meiosis in autopolyploids by restoring bivalent pairing during meiosis, but the high degree of homology among duplicated chromosomes causes autopolyploids to display polysomic inheritance. This trait is often used as a diagnostic criterion to distinguish autopolyploids from allopolyploids, which commonly display disomic inheritance after they progress past the neopolyploid stage. While most polyploid species are unambiguously characterized as either autopolyploid or allopolyploid, these categories represent the ends of a spectrum between of divergence between parental subgenomes. Polyploids that fall between these two extremes, which are often referred to as segmental allopolyploids, may display intermediate levels of polysomic inheritance that vary by locus.|$|E
25|$|Others have {{approached}} {{their study of}} the origins of genomic imprinting from a different side, arguing that natural selection is operating on the role of epigenetic marks as machinery for <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> recognition during meiosis, rather than on their role in differential expression. This argument centers on the existence of epigenetic effects on chromosomes that do not directly affect gene expression, but do depend on which parent the chromosome originated from. This group of epigenetic changes that depend on the chromosome's parent of origin (including both those that affect gene expression and those that do not) are called parental origin effects, and include phenomena such as paternal X inactivation in the marsupials, nonrandom parental chromatid distribution in the ferns, and even mating type switching in yeast. This diversity in organisms that show parental origin effects has prompted theorists to place the evolutionary origin of genomic imprinting before the last common ancestor of plants and animals, over a billion years ago.|$|E

50|$|In {{prophase}} I of meiosis I, each chromosome is {{aligned with}} its homologous partner and pairs completely. In prophase I, the DNA has already undergone replication so each chromosome {{consists of two}} identical chromatids connected by a common centromere. During the zygotene stage of prophase I, the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> pair up with each other. This pairing occurs by a synapsis process where the synaptonemal complex - a protein scaffold - is assembled and joins the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> along their lengths. Cohesin crosslinking occurs between the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and helps them resist being pulled apart until anaphase. Genetic crossing over occurs during the pachytene stage of prophase I. In this process, genes are exchanged by the breaking and union of homologous portions of the chromosomes’ lengths.

25|$|One of the best-recognized {{theories}} {{that leads to}} copy number variations as well as deletions and inversions is non-allelic homologous recombinations. During meiotic recombination, homologous chromosomes pair up and form two ended double-stranded breaks leading to Holliday junctions. However, in the aberrant mechanism, during the formation of Holliday junctions, the double-stranded breaks are misaligned and the crossover lands in non-allelic positions on the same chromosome. When the Holliday junction is resolved, the unequal crossing over event allows transfer of genetic material between the two homologous chromosomes, and as a result, {{a portion of the}} DNA on both the homologues is repeated. Since the repeated regions are no longer segregating independently, the duplicated region of the chromosome is inherited. Another type of homologous recombination based mechanism that can lead to copy number variation is known as break induced replication. When a double stranded break occurs in the genome unexpectedly the cell activates pathways that mediate the repair of the break. Errors in repairing the break, similar to non-allelic homologous recombination, can lead to an increase in copy number of a particular region of the genome. During the repair of a double stranded break, the broken end can invade its <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> instead of rejoin the original strand. As in the non-allelic homologous recombination mechanism, an extra copy of a particular region is transferred to another chromosome, leading to a duplication event. Furthermore, cohesin proteins are found to aid in the repair system of double stranded breaks through clamping the two ends in close proximity which prevents interchromosomal invasion of the ends. If for any reason, such as activation of ribosomal RNA, cohesin activity is affected then there may be local increase in double stranded break repair errors.|$|E

500|$|The RPA protein, {{which has}} high {{affinity}} for single-stranded DNA, then binds the 3' overhangs. [...] With {{the help of}} several other proteins that mediate the process, the Rad51 protein (and Dmc1, in meiosis) then forms a filament of nucleic acid and protein on the single strand of DNA coated with RPA. [...] This nucleoprotein filament then begins searching for DNA sequences {{similar to that of}} the 3' overhang. [...] After finding such a sequence, the single-stranded nucleoprotein filament moves into (invades) the similar or identical recipient DNA duplex in a process called strand invasion. [...] In cells that divide through mitosis, the recipient DNA duplex is generally a sister chromatid, which is identical to the damaged DNA molecule and provides a template for repair. [...] In meiosis, however, the recipient DNA tends to be from a similar but not necessarily identical <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome.</b> [...] A displacement loop (D-loop) is formed during strand invasion between the invading 3' overhang strand and the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome.</b> After strand invasion, a DNA polymerase extends the end of the invading 3' strand by synthesizing new DNA. [...] This changes the D-loop to a cross-shaped structure known as a Holliday junction. Following this, more DNA synthesis occurs on the invading strand (i.e., one of the original 3' overhangs), effectively restoring the strand on the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> that was displaced during strand invasion.|$|E

500|$|After {{the stages}} of resection, strand {{invasion}} and DNA synthesis, the DSBR and SDSA pathways become distinct. [...] The DSBR pathway is unique in that the second 3' overhang (which {{was not involved in}} strand invasion) also forms a Holliday junction with the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome.</b> [...] The double Holliday junctions are then converted into recombination products by nicking endonucleases, a type of restriction endonuclease which cuts only one DNA strand. The DSBR pathway commonly results in crossover, though it can sometimes result in non-crossover products; the ability of a broken DNA molecule to collect sequences from separated donor loci was shown in mitotic budding yeast using plasmids or endonuclease induction of chromosomal events. Because of this tendency for chromosomal crossover, the DSBR pathway is a likely model of how crossover homologous recombination occurs during meiosis.|$|E

Another mechanism involves meiosis. The majority of C. neoformans are mating [...] "type a".

The diploid nuclei of blastospores can undergo meiosis, including recombination, to form haploid basidiospores that can be dispersed.
