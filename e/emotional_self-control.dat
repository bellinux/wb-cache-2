50|$|Recent {{trends in}} {{behaviour}} genetics have indicated an additional focus toward researching the inheritance of human characteristics typically studied in developmental psychology. For instance, {{a major focus}} in developmental psychology has been to characterize the influence of parenting styles on children. However, in most studies, genes are a confounding variable. Because children share half of their alleles with each parent, any observed effects of parenting styles could be effects of having {{many of the same}} alleles as a parent (e.g. harsh aggressive parenting styles have been found to correlate with similar aggressive child characteristics: is it the parenting or the genes?). Thus, behaviour genetics research is currently undertaking to distinguish the effects of the family environment from the effects of genes.

Continuing research with these original participants has examined how preschool delay of gratification ability links to development over the life course, and may predict a variety of important outcomes (e.g., SAT scores, social and cognitive competence, educational attainment, and drug use), and can have significant protective effects against a variety of potential vulnerabilities. This work also opened a route to research on temporal discounting in decision-making, and most importantly into the mental mechanisms that enable cognitive and <b>emotional</b> <b>self-control,</b> thereby helping to demystify the concept of willpower.

With younger adolescents, we studied the pathways through which emotion regulation attributes {{are related to}} predisposing factors for disorder. MethodsA sample of 3561 adolescents (M age 12. 5 years) was surveyed. Measures for <b>emotional</b> <b>self-control</b> (regulation of sadness and anger), emotional dysregulation (angerability, affective lability, and rumination about sadness or anger), and behavioral self-control (planfulness and problem solving) were obtained. A structural model was analyzed with regulation attributes related to six intermediate variables that are established risk or protective factors for adolescent substance use (e. g., academic involvement, stressful life events). Criterion variables were externalizing and internalizing symptomatology and positive well-being. ResultsIndirect pathways were found from emotional regulation to symptomatology through academic competence, stressful events, and deviance-prone attitudes and cognitions. Direct effects were also found: from emotional dysregulation to externalizing and internalizing symptomatology; <b>emotional</b> <b>self-control</b> to well-being; and behavioral self-control (inverse) to externalizing symptomatology. <b>Emotional</b> <b>self-control</b> and emotional dysregulation had independent effects and different types of pathways. ConclusionsAdolescents scoring high on emotional dysregulation {{are at risk for}} substance dependence because of more externalizing and internalizing symptomatology. Independently, youth with better behavioral and <b>emotional</b> <b>self-control</b> are at lower risk. This occurs partly through relations of regulation constructs to environmental variables that affect levels of symptomatology (e. g., stressful events, poor academic performance).

40|$|We {{propose that}} the {{anterior}} cingulate cortex is a specialization of neocortex rather than a more primitive stage of cortical evolution. Functions central to intelligent behavior, that is, <b>emotional</b> <b>self-control,</b> focused problem solving, error recognition, and adaptive response to changing conditions, are juxtaposed with the emotions in this structure. Evidence of an important role for the anterior cingulate cortex in these functions has accumulated through single-neuron recording, electrical stimulation, EEG, PET, fMRI, and lesion studies. The anterior cingulate cortex contains a class of spindle-shaped neurons that are found only in humans and the great apes, and thus are a recent evolutionary specialization probably related to these functions. The spindle cells appear to be widely connected with diverse {{parts of the brain}} and may have a role in the coordination that would be essential in developing the capacity to focus on difficult problems.

40|$|Abstract Many {{studies suggest}} that in poker, amount of money wagered and time spent playing are {{prominent}} predictors of problem gambling. These observations are in discord with anecdotal and empirical evidence. Due to the skill component inherent in poker, active players who play for long hours attempting to make a profit—sometimes by wagering large amounts of money—might be labeled as problem gamblers despite having high levels of well-being and financial stability. In three online correlative studies, we assessed the associations between poker experience, problem gambling (as indicated by the South Oaks Gambling Screen [SOGS] and the Problem Gambling Severity Index [PGSI]) and various measures of social and <b>emotional</b> well-being, <b>self-control</b> and emotion regulation. Problem-gambling severity predicts reduced well-being and self-control, increased social anomie, and detrimental emotion regulation. Experienced poker players exhibited high problem-gambling severity, {{but none of the}} adverse consequences thereof. Thus, a discrepancy was exposed concerning the validity of SOGS and PGSI. We conclude that these measures may not be valid in assessing problematic/detrimental gambling in poker-playing populations, {{especially in the case of}} experienced players, who play for long hours i...|$|R

The first study aimed to develop a personality inventory to assess the personality traits of those who practice Karate. A preliminary form was administered to 187 college students of both sexes, and a new form of personality inventory consisting of 27 seven-point scales emerged wherefrom. The new form was found both reliable and valid. The second study aimed to assess the personality traits of those who practice Karate (n= 68) as opposed to non-practitioners (n= 118) by using the above inventory. Factor analysis yielded five factors: sociability, <b>emotional</b> stability, <b>self-control,</b> physical health, and life discipline.

The preferred teaching method for children with autism is an individually tailored education plan, targeting <b>emotional</b> regulation, behavioural <b>self-control,</b> and cognitive inhibition, inflexibility, and rigidity. A consulting developmental psychologist well versed in autistic spectrum disorders, who is trained in applied behaviour analysis (ABA) and discrete trial training (DTT), is able to provide insight into how a school environment can support the acquisition, maintenance, and generalisation of socially appropriate behaviours and provide guidelines for developing an appropriate curriculum for the child.
