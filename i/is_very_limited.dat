5|$|Mallards are {{differentiated}} {{in their}} mitochondrial DNA between North American and Eurasian populations, but the nuclear genome displays a notable lack of genetic structure. Haplotypes typical of American mallard relatives and spotbills {{can be found}} in mallards around the Bering Sea. The Aleutian Islands hold a population of mallards that appear to be evolving towards a subspecies, as gene flow with other populations <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} verify British claims against the British' main opponents in 1941 and 1942, JG 26 and JG 2, <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited.</b> Only {{two of the}} 30 volumes of War Diaries {{produced}} by JG 26 survived the war. Historian Donald Caldwell has attempted to use what limited German material is available to compare losses and air victory claims but acknowledges the lack of sources leave the possibility for error.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> data on reproduction. Young are {{probably}} born near {{the start of}} the rainy season, in November–December, when food is plentiful. Six bats were caught at the roost site in Kianjavato, of which only one was a male; this led Bates and colleagues to suggest that the species may be polygynous, with groups consisting of a male and multiple females.|$|E

5|$|According to Plutarch, an army under Parmenion {{defeated}} the Illyrian king Grabos in 356 BC, {{shortly after the}} conclusion of the siege of Potidea. Grabos then became a subject ally of Macedon. The following year, Philip seems to have defeated Ketriporis, and reduced him to the status of a subject ally, although information for this campaign <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited.</b> He is also presumed to have {{defeated the}} Paionians at some point during this period, although there is no explicit record of this. There is no evidence that any of these allies received any substantial aid from Athens, which was still too preoccupied with the Social War.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the ill-fated}} 1263 {{expedition}} of Haakon IV of Norway, the Outer Hebrides {{along with the}} Isle of Man, were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland {{a result of the}} 1266 Treaty of Perth. Although their contribution to the islands can still be found in personal and placenames, the archaeological record of the Norse period <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited.</b> The best known find from this time is the Lewis chessmen, which date from the mid 12th century.|$|E
5|$|In cool {{temperate}} regions, conifers often predominate; {{a widely}} distributed climax {{community in the}} far north of the northern hemisphere is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal forest). Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's forest cover. The long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> under their dense cover {{and there may be}} little plant life on the forest floor, although fungi may abound. Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.|$|E

5|$|The initial accretional heating {{together}} with continued decay of radioactive elements were probably {{strong enough to}} melt the ice if some antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of ammonia hydrate) or some salt was present. Further melting {{may have led to}} the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water ('ocean') rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core–mantle boundary. The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176K. If the temperature dropped below this value the ocean would have frozen by now. Freezing of the water would have led to expansion of the interior, which may have also contributed to the formation of canyon-like graben. Still, present knowledge of the evolution of Oberon <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited.</b>|$|E
5|$|The nearest {{railway station}} {{to the stadium}} is Bordesley, on the Birmingham to Stratford Line between Moor Street and Small Heath stations, which has regular {{services}} only on match days. The stadium is a 20-minute walk from New Street station, which is served by direct trains from {{most parts of the}} country, and slightly less far from Moor Street, which is served by Chiltern Railways trains from London Marylebone. Birmingham Coach Station, served by National Express coaches, is a 15-minute walk away, and buses run from the city centre past the ground. There <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> parking at the stadium itself, but a secure outdoor car park is available at Birmingham Wheels Park, less than 15 minutes walk away, and parking is permitted in the streets surrounding the ground.|$|E
5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates have {{segmented}} {{bodies with}} jointed limbs, all {{covered in a}} cuticle made of chitin and proteins. The chelicerate bauplan consists of two tagmata, the prosoma and the opisthosoma, except that mites have lost a visible division between these sections. The chelicerae, which give the group its name, are the only appendages that appear before the mouth. In most sub-groups, they are modest pincers used to feed. However, spiders' chelicerae form fangs that most species use to inject venom into prey. The group has the open circulatory system typical of arthropods, in which a tube-like heart pumps blood through the hemocoel, which is the major body cavity. Marine chelicerates have gills, while the air-breathing forms generally have both book lungs and tracheae. In general, the ganglia of living chelicerates' central nervous systems fuse into large masses in the cephalothorax, but there are wide variations and this fusion <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>limited</b> in the Mesothelae, which are regarded as {{the oldest and most}} primitive group of spiders. Most chelicerates rely on modified bristles for touch and for information about vibrations, air currents, and chemical changes in their environment. The most active hunting spiders also have very acute eyesight.|$|E
