500|$|In November 2007, the Anne Frank tree—by then {{infected}} with a fungal disease affecting the tree trunk—was {{scheduled to be}} cut down {{to prevent it from}} falling on the surrounding buildings. Dutch economist Arnold Heertje said about the tree: [...] "This is not just any tree. The Anne Frank tree is bound up with the persecution of the Jews." [...] The Tree Foundation, a group of tree conservationists, started a civil case to stop the felling of the horse chestnut, which received international media attention. A Dutch court ordered city officials and conservationists to explore alternatives and come to a solution. The parties built a steel construction that was expected to prolong the life of the tree up to 15 years. However, it was only three years later, on 23 August 2010, that gale-force winds blew down the tree. Eleven saplings from the tree were distributed to museums, schools, parks and Holocaust remembrance centres through a project led by the Anne Frank Center USA. The first sapling was planted in April 2013 at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. Saplings were also sent to a school in Little Rock, Arkansas that was the scene of a desegregation battle, Liberty Park (Manhattan), which honours victims of the September 11 attacks, and other sites in the United States. Another <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>tree</b> honoring Frank was planted in 2010 at Kelly Ingram Park in Birmingham, Alabama.|$|E

30|$|<b>Horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> (marronnier) {{is a tall}} {{deciduous}} {{tree that}} belongs to genus Aesculus of family Hippocastanaceae [1, 2]. It is a magnificent tree with loosely expanding big branches. Space created by <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> lining a street has beneficial effects such as charm and the feeling of peace. This is why streets are lined with many <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> in Europe. The US <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> bear seed from September to November, and the fallen seed abundantly covers roadsides. The fallen seed is taken away by rodents for caching [3]. Nonetheless, the fallen seeds, which are quite large, remain concentrated under canopies of mother trees {{and need to be}} removed. The <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed is covered with a hard theca. When the theca is cracked, a seed appears that closely resembles a <b>chestnut</b> seed. <b>Horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed contains a high concentration of saponin as well as aesclin and coumarin glycoside, which exert antithrombotic action and can be used as pharmaceutical drugs [4]. On the other hand, because <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed is not edible, it is not much utilized and is treated as waste. Its effective utilization is a big issue at present. To effectively utilize <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seed, it is necessary to examine the properties of ground seed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{large parts}} of Europe <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> (Aesculus hippocastanum) suffer from severe {{defoliation}} by an alien invasive species, the specialist leaf mining moth Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera; Gracillariidae). Heavily infested trees have a drastically shortened period for photosynthesis. We quantified the effect of moth infestation on reproduction of <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> in two different cities in central Europe, Bern and Munich. C. ohridella negatively affected seed and fruit weight of A. hippocastanum at both locations. In Munich, seed weight of heavily damaged trees was reduced by almost half. However, the number of seeds per fruit, the number of fruits per inflorescence, {{and the number of}} inflorescences per tree did not change due to herbivory. We conclude that C. ohridella mining affects seed quality but not seed quantity. The reduced seed weight may severely impair growth and survival of <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> seedlings and thus may endanger the long-term persistence of A. hippocas-tanum in its endemic forests in south-east Europe...|$|R

5000|$|The mansion {{was located}} {{on the western side}} of Ravenhill, and had a garden {{stretching}} from the mansion itself to the far back end of Cadle woods. The mansion dated back as far as the 1860s as many ordinace survey maps from 1861-8 show the mansion's existence http://www.francisfrith.com/search/wales/west+glamorgan/fforestfach/maps/fforestfach_maps.htm, the owner of the mansion planted many trees around his land most notably the Aesculus hippocastanum tree (<b>Horse</b> <b>Chestnut</b> <b>Tree),</b> which can still be see today in the local area. The owner of the house is blamed for the local Japanese knotweed problem within the Swansea area, as back in 19th-century Japanese knotweed was used commonly as a potted plant for ornamental use and was also used on his land to prevent soil erosion.|$|E
5000|$|Winslow was {{regarded}} as an important station on the line, possibly {{even more so than}} Bicester, for it was the place where trains for Banbury and Oxford were joined and divided in the early years, even after the opening of [...] Passenger facilities were provided on each platform which were more generous than those found elsewhere on the line. Architecturally, the brick station resembled the stone structure provided at Bicester, particularly its twin symmetrical gables covered by ridge tiles and its portico. A stationhouse was also provided for the stationmaster and this was situated just beyond the main station building and arranged around a circular driveway at the centre of which was a large <b>horse</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>tree.</b> A coal yard lay to the east of the station, while a goods yard was provided to the west. Winslow Gasworks opened in 1880 on a site immediately to the south of the coal yard; it received up to 1000 tons of coal annually via the yard, although it was not rail-connected. The station was lit by gas until the trains cease to call.|$|E
