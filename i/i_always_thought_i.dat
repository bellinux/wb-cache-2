500|$|As well {{as being}} tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has {{discussed}} the humour she incorporates into her performances: [...] "I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than you would do. If {{you want to play}} comedy then {{you have to be very}} intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E
500|$|Nielsen {{lived for}} several years in Fort Norman (now Tulita) in the Northwest Territories where his father was with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. His father was an abusive man who beat his wife and sons, and Leslie longed to escape. When he {{graduated}} from high school at 17, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force even though he was legally deaf (he wore hearing aids most of his life). Following graduation from Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts in Edmonton, Nielsen enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and trained as an aerial gunner during World War II. He was too young to be fully trained or sent overseas. He worked briefly as a disc jockey at a Calgary, Alberta, radio station, before enrolling at the Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts in Toronto. While studying in Toronto, Nielsen received a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse. He noted, [...] "I couldn't refuse, but I must say when you come from the land of the snow goose, the moose and wool to New York, you're bringing every ton of hayseed and country bumpkin that you packed. As long as I didn't open my mouth, I felt a certain security. But <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was going to be unmasked: 'OK, pack your stuff.' 'Well, what's the matter?' 'We've discovered you have no talent; we're shipping you back to Canada. He moved to New York City for his scholarship, studying theatre and music at the Neighborhood Playhouse, while performing in summer stock theatre. Afterward, he attended the Actors Studio, until his first television appearance in 1950 on an episode of Studio One, alongside Charlton Heston, for which he was paid $75.|$|E

6000|$|BROADBENT. Yes: I know I have {{a strong}} sense of humor which {{sometimes}} makes people doubt whether I am quite serious.

6000|$|... 'Well, what?' said Mrs. Fulmort, with girlish curiosity. 'Not that it's any use settling. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> {{would marry}} a marquis's younger son, {{because it is}} such a pretty title, and that he should play on the guitar. But he must not be an officer, Phoebe; we have had trouble enough about that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|These importunities {{were the}} mother's pleasure. If ever she delayed compliance, {{it was only}} to hear them repeated, and to enjoy her child's soft, half-playful, half-petulant urgency.

And now if Papa goes out with Admiral Penrose, and Hal too--oh! it will be so horrid home!" ...|$|E
60|$|That is what I suspected.

60|$|Now, how in {{the world}} they knew what sort of a ship that was, and which way it was sailing, I couldn't tell for the life of me.

6000|$|It {{was long}} before the old rector could {{reconcile}} himself either to the new rector or his new son-in-law. Mrs. Clavering had now so warmly taken up Fanny's part, and had so completely assumed a mother's interest in her coming marriage, that Mr. Clavering, or Sir Henry, as we may now call him, had found himself obliged to abstain from repeating to her the wonder with which he still regarded his daughter's choice. But to Harry he could still be eloquent on the subject. [...] "Of course it's all right now," [...] ho said. [...] "He's a very good young man, and nobody would work harder in the parish. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was very lucky to have such an assistant; but, upon my word, I can not understand Fanny--I can not, indeed." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{therefore}} beg my dear Papa to be gracious to me; and can {{here say}} that, after long reflection, my conscience has not {{accused me of}} any the least thing with which I could reproach myself.

But now I feel as if the earth were undermined, and all my friends have lost one thickness of reality since that one passed.

2500|$|Warhol {{had this}} to say about the attack: [...] "Before <b>I</b> was shot, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> was more half-there than all-there—I <b>always</b> {{suspected}} that <b>I</b> was watching TV instead of living life. People sometimes say that the way things happen in movies is unreal, but actually it's the way things happen in life that's unreal. The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television—you don't feel anything. Right when I was being shot and ever since, I knew that I was watching television. The channels switch, but it's all television." ...|$|R
