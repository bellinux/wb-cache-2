50|$|Due {{to living}} in frigid depths, the sleeper shark's liver oil does not contain squalene, which would solidify into a dense, nonbuoyant mass. Instead, the low-density {{compounds}} in the sharks' liver are diacylglyceryl ethers and triacylglycerol, which maintain their fluidity even at the lowest temperatures. Also, they store very little urea in their skin (like many <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>sharks),</b> but like other elasmobranchs, have high concentrations of urea and trimethylamine oxide (nitrogenous waste products) in their tissues as osmoprotectants and to increase their buoyancy. Trimethylamine oxide also serves to counteract the protein-destabilizing tendencies of urea and pressure.

40|$|The Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (DWH) {{released}} about 4. 4 {{million barrels}} of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), {{making it one of}} the largest oil spills in U. S. history. Additionally, the depth of the spill (i. e., 1500 meters) created a unique research opportunity because most oil spills occur at the surface and affect coastal rather than deepwater habitats. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are the most toxic components of oil, and are often the focus of oil exposure studies. PAHs are quickly metabolized by vertebrates; therefore, indicators of biological responses to PAH exposure (PAH “biomarkers”) such as the levels of PAH detoxification enzymes and the resulting metabolites are commonly used to examine oil exposure. This study measured multiple PAH biomarkers including hepatic activity of the PAH detoxification enzymes cytochrome P 4501 a 1 (CYP 1 A) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), as well as biliary PAH metabolites in <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>sharks</b> and bony fishes from areas affected by the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. Samples were collected from 2011 - 2013 from seven species of sharks, with special focus on the four most abundant deep sea species: Centrophorus niakang, Centrophorus cf granulosus, Squalus cubensis and Squalus cf mitsikurii. Overall enzyme activity was low in these sharks, yet it was higher in oiled sites compared to reference locations. Additionally some species showed declining CYP 1 A activity since the time of the oil spill, suggesting exposure to CYP-inducing compounds during the beginning of the survey period. Last, PAHs of a petrogenic nature were more abundant in oiled sites compared to reference locations. Overall, this project provides the much need biomarker data for sharks as well as insight on exposure and metabolism of PAHs in <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>sharks</b> after the DWH...|$|E

Sharks adapt well to fairly high pressures. They can often be found on slopes down to about 2000 metres, scavenging on food falls such as dead whales.

These energy needs cannot be met in the extreme oligotrophic conditions that occur at great depths.|$|R

40|$|The deep-sea is {{the largest}} habitat on earth, {{containing}} over 90 percent of the world’s oceans and home to over 20, 000 species. Deep-sea ecosystems are increasingly impacted by human activities including fishing and oil extraction. To understand potential impacts on deep-sea food webs, {{it is crucial to}} gather baseline data in these systems. I quantified the trophic interactions of three groups of deep-water animals across a range of trophic levels living in the northern and eastern Gulf of Mexico using stable isotope analysis. First, I propose methods for correcting δ 15 N values for the presence of nitrogenous metabolic waste products (e. g., urea) in muscle tissue using chemical extractions and/or species-specific mathematical normalizations. Significant differences in δ 15 N, %N, and C:N values as a result of extractions were observed in eight of ten shark and all three hagfish species. The δ 15 N values increased, but shifts in %N and C:N values were not unidirectional. Mathematical normalizations for δ 15 N values were successfully created for four shark and two hagfish species. I then describe the trophic interactions of three consumer assemblages. Carbon isotopic values indicate a heavy reliance on allochthonous nutrient inputs from surface waters. Nitrogen isotopic values reveal somewhat atypical taxa as top predators in the <b>deep</b> <b>sea.</b> <b>Shark,</b> teleost, and invertebrate species across a wide range of body sizes are feeding at a similar trophic level. This apparent lack of size structuring could be the result of a high degree of opportunistic scavenging or perhaps feeding at many trophic levels simultaneously in an oligotrophic system. There was a high degree of isotopic niche overlap among species within each consumer assemblage, perhaps the result of limited nutrient resources in the deep-sea. In general, individuals from the northern sampling stations displayed higher δ 13 C and δ 15 N values than those from the eastern sites. With {{the exception of a few}} species, there were no strong relationships between body size and isotopic values.

40|$|The {{state of}} play Taxonomic and {{systematic}} studies of chondrichthyan fishes are presently going through a renaissance. Exploratory fishing sur-veys in previously unexplored regions {{have led to the}} discovery of many new taxa. Almost 1170 species are known to occur worldwide, of which slightly more than 1000 have been for-mally described since the first chondrichthyans were described by Linnaeus in 1758 (Fig. 1). About 370 species, or {{more than a third of}} the world’s known chondrichthyan fauna, have been described or discovered in the last 30 years. An increasing awareness of the role of chondrichthyan fishes as apical predators in marine ecosystems, serious conservation concerns for these fishes, which are now widely considered to be amongst the most vulnerable of all marine animals, and a need to understand and manage marine biodiversity, has greatly elevated their profile in recent times.

40|$|The oceanic abyss (depths {{greater than}} 3000  m), {{one of the}} largest environments on the planet, is {{characterized}} by absence of solar light, high pressures and remoteness from surface food supply necessitating special molecular, physiological, behavioural and ecological adaptations of organisms that live there. Sampling by trawl, baited hooks and cameras we show that the Chondrichthyes (sharks, rays and chimaeras) are absent from, or very rare in this region. Analysis of a global data set shows a trend of rapid disappearance of chondrichthyan species with depth when compared with bony fishes. Sharks, apparently well adapted to life at high pressures are conspicuous on slopes down to 2000  m including scavenging at food falls such as dead whales. We propose that they are excluded from the abyss by high-energy demand, including an oil-rich liver for buoyancy, which cannot be sustained in extreme oligotrophic conditions. Sharks are apparently confined to ca 30 % of the total ocean and distribution of many species is fragmented around sea mounts, ocean ridges and ocean margins. All populations are therefore within reach of human fisheries, and there is no hidden reserve of chondrichthyan biomass or biodiversity in the <b>deep</b> <b>sea.</b> <b>Sharks</b> may be more vulnerable to over-exploitation than previously thought...|$|E

40|$|Anelasma squalicola is a {{recently}} evolved parasite. Very {{little is known}} of its biology due to its normally low prevalence in <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> lantern <b>sharks</b> (family: Etmopteridae), {{in which it is}} found embedded in the skin. A population of more heavily infected sharks (Etmopterus spinax) in Lusterfjord, Norway, has allowed for sampling by trawl, and subsequent observations and measurements of the parasite and host. The study shows that E. spinax has a heterogeneous population structure and potentially narrow home range, which likely affects prevalence and dispersal of A. squalicola. A. squalicola appears capable of infecting hosts regardless of size. It has high site specificity, which may be due to areas of the shark where the skin is easier to penetrate. It is most commonly found in pairs, which gives it an atypical intensity distribution. The data suggests the first individual to settle can attract partners to the same site, but this attraction does not result in more infections at other sites on the host. Attracting more than one partner appears to severely reduce their fecundity, which may imply a crowding effect. Infection did not affect liver mass or condition of hosts, but appears to prevent maturation in males. This study provides the most extensive parasitological description of A. squalicola to date, and reveals both a complex host population as well as a highly distinctive infection behaviour, which combined shape this parasite- host interaction...|$|R

40|$|SYNOPSIS. The major lipids {{that have}} a direct role in {{buoyancy}} of marine fish are wax esters, squalene, and alkyldiacylglycerols. Wax esters are stored extracellu-larly in certain fishes, such as the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus), and therefore buoyancy appears to be their sole function. Some myctophid fishes have wax-invested swimbladders, where the non-compressible wax esters may aid in diurnal vertical migration, by replacing compressible swimbladder gases. Squalene is metabolically inert in the livers of certain sharks, and therefore probably has buoyancy as its only function. Alkyldiacylglycerols (DAGE) are abundant com-ponents of liver oil of certain <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>sharks</b> and holocephalans, where they may {{have an important role}} in buoyancy. Triacylglycerols and cholesterol are lipids {{that have a}}n indirect role in buoyancy of marine fish. Many fishes in the ocean have oil-filled bones (mostly triacylglycerols). Although this oil aids buoyancy, its major function is as an energy storage lipid which can be utilized during starva-tion. Cholesterol, which is found in high amounts in the lipid-rich membranes of the swimbladder of deep sea fishes, may aid buoyancy by combining with oxygen gas in the swimbladder membranes to facilitate gas secretion in fish at great depths in the ocean. Further research is needed to understand the physical state of lipids, such as wax esters at deep sea temperatures and pressures, and more evidence is needed to clarify the role of cholesterol-rich membranes in swimbladders of deep sea fishes...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} two superficially similar species of <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>sharks,</b> Centroselachus crepidater and Deania calcea, {{with the purpose}} of better understanding the drivers of differentiation and subsequent biodiversity in the deep sea. To achieve this four sample sites were used to coarsely represent the Atlantic and Pacific distribution of each species, with the genomes of each individual being sampled using a ddRADseq protocol. From these genome samples thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified and bioinformatically separated into neutral and outlier (under possible selective forces) marker sets which were then investigated for patterns of population genetic structure and adaptive function. Despite comparable life history traits and overlapping sample sites, the two species showed differing patterns of differentiation across their range. In the neutral loci, C. crepidater showed significant differentiation between the Pacific and Atlantic, and homogeneity in the Atlantic. D. calcea showed effective panmixia across all sample sites. In the outlier loci, C. crepidater again showed Atlantic-Pacific differentiation, but also a split between the Rockall Trough and the Mid Atlantic Ridge. D. calcea also showed outlier differentiation between the Atlantic and Pacific, as well as significant divergence between two spatially similar sample sites in the Rockall Trough. Two possible proteins were identified linked to adaptive function, which were not insightful in themselves, but provide a starting point for future study. These data combined with previous work on this deep sea taxon suggest that there is variation in patterns of differentiation between closely related species. However, common to all species so far studied are apparent high levels of vagility and dispersive capacity across global ranges. This provides further evidence that geographical barriers to dispersal are of lesser importance in determining genetic structure in deep sea basins, whilst isolation by distance and diversification along environmental clines likely play a more predominant role. ...|$|E
40|$|Shark fin, {{used as a}} food, is a {{rich source}} of glycosaminoglyans (GAGs), acidic polysaccharides having {{important}} biological activities, suggesting their nutraceutical and pharmaceutical application. A comprehensive survey of GAGs derived from the fin was performed on 11 elasmobranchs, including several <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>sharks.</b> Chondroitin sulfate (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were found in Isurus oxyrinchus, Prionace glauca, Scyliorhinus torazame, Deania calcea, Chlamydoselachus anguineus, Mitsukurina owatoni, Mustelus griseus and Dasyatis akajei, respectively. CS was only found from Chimaera phantasma, Dalatias licha, and Odontaspis ferox, respectively. Characteristic disaccharide units of most of the CS were comprised of C- and D-type units. Interestingly, substantial amount of CS/dermatan sulfate (DS) was found in the dried fin (without skin and cartilage) of Isurus oxyrinchus and Prionace glauca. 1 H-NMR analysis showed that the composition of glucuronic acid (GlcA) and iduronic acid (IdoA) in shark CS/DS was 41. 2 % and 58. 8 % (Isurus oxyrinchus), 36. 1 % and 63. 9 % (Prionace glauca), respectively. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of this CS/DS consisted of E-, B- and D-type units. Shark CS/DS stimulated neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons at a similar level as DS derived from invertebrate species. Midkine and pleiotrophin interact strongly with CS/DS from Isurus oxyrinchus and Prionace glauca, affording Kd values of 1. 07 nM, 6. 25 nM and 1. 70 nM, 1. 88 nM, respectively. These results strongly suggest that the IdoA-rich domain of CS/DS is required for neurite outgrowth activity. A detailed examination of oligosaccharide residues, produced by chondroitinase ACII digestion, suggested that the IdoA and B-type units as well as A- and C-type units were found in clusters in shark CS/DS. In addition, it was discovered that the contents of B-type units in these IdoA-rich domain increased in a length dependent manner, while C- and D-type units were located particularly in the immediate vicinity of the IdoA-rich domain...|$|E
