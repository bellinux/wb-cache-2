5|$|Belief in {{prenatal}} fetal awareness, mental {{communication between}} mother and unborn child, and <b>emotional</b> <b>attachment</b> of child to mother as a prenatal phenomenon, are concepts that connect easily to the unfounded assumption that all adopted children suffer emotional disorders. These beliefs are also congruent with CAM psychotherapies such as attachment therapy (not based on attachment theory), which purport to bring about age regression and to recapitulate early development to produce a better outcome.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the colonial period, the region of South Kasai formed part of the Luba Empire, a {{federation}} of local kingdoms with a degree of cultural uniformity. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Baluba spread across large parts of the Kasai-Katanga savannah along the Kasai river basin and eventually developed into a number of ethnic subgroups, notably the Luba-Kasai and the Luba-Katanga. Although never united into a single centralised state, the groups retained a degree of <b>emotional</b> <b>attachment</b> based around shared origin myths and cultural practices. Other groups, like the Songye and the Kanyok, also had long histories in the Kasai region.|$|E

Qualitative studies {{from the field of}} migration studies have tended to examine generational cohorts in isolation from one another rather than alongside each other. Through exploring the <b>emotional</b> <b>attachments</b> to place(s) of first and second generation Zimbabwean, Somali, Sudanese and Kenyan migrants, the paper interprets the emotions associated with senses of belonging through ideas of plurilocal homes and simultaneity of attachments to different places...|$|R

5|$|Concern {{with the}} harm of {{separation}} from the mother is characteristic of the belief systems behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such belief systems are concerned {{not only with the}} effect of the young child's {{separation from the}} care of the mother, but with an <b>emotional</b> <b>attachment</b> between mother and child which advocates of these systems believe to develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if the child is separated from the birth mother and adopted, even if this occurs on the day of birth and even if the adoptive family provides all possible love and care. These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background. Today, however, beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as William Emerson.|$|E
5|$|Fischer and Cristina {{often did}} outdoor {{activities}} together, but Fischer's stepmother {{thought they were}} only friends. She said that she never saw them hold hands or behave {{in a way that}} suggested intimacy. According to his friends, Fischer went with Cristina to South Padre Island, Texas, during spring break and had sex with her in her parents' condominium. They said that he did not brag about it, and in fact seemed to regret his decision. Cristina denied this ever happened. Later that year they attended St. Joe's prom together. In June 1992, Fischer broke up with Cristina; he told one of his friends that their relationship was only physical, and he did not feel an <b>emotional</b> <b>attachment</b> to her. Fischer had given Cristina his ring while they were dating, and once they broke up he asked her to return it. Cristina refused.|$|E
5|$|One {{does not}} only feel a social or {{external}} pressure to fulfill roles {{and expectations of}} being a good parent, sibling, or child, however. There is a distinctly emotional and internal pressure to be ‘good’ due to psychological attachments in spousal, sibling and/or parent-children relationships. Psychological persuasion in advertisements appeals to one's motives, attitudes and personalities. The family symbol is psychologically persuasive in that it appeals to the emotional attachments between spouses, siblings, or parent-child relationships. To continue the above example, the mother not only wants to purchase a product that purportedly limits irritation or harm for her child due to her social role and expectations, but also because she feels an <b>emotional</b> <b>attachment</b> to her child. The attempt to activate the emotions of audiences and to psychologically persuade is popular among advertisements. Family affects us significantly on this psychological level – {{the level at which}} advertisements are most effective.|$|E

5|$|When {{the crew}} awaken, they find {{themselves}} out of the control beds {{with no sign of}} the Gangers. However, their own personal belongings have been gone through and the TARDIS has sunk into acid-corroded ground. The Doctor explains that they have likely been unconscious {{for more than an hour}} and the Gangers have gained sentience. They soon discover that two of the Gangers are amongst them, posing as Cleaves and Jennifer (Sarah Smart), when the two give themselves away by turning pale-white. Jennifer also exhibits the ability to contort and stretch her body well beyond human limits. The Jennifer Ganger struggles with her new identity and befriends Rory who has begun to demonstrate an <b>emotional</b> <b>attachment</b> to her. The Cleaves Ganger works in secret with the other Gangers to try to kill the real humans, as the human Cleaves plans to kill the Gangers. The Doctor attempts to reunite the two sides but fails when the human Cleaves kills one of the Gangers with a high-powered electrical charge. The Gangers plan an attack, and the Doctor accuses Cleaves of killing a living being which Cleaves refuses to acknowledge. The Ganger Jennifer hunts her human counterpart to kill her. The Doctor determines that in a monastery, the safest place to be is the chapel, and directs everyone there. The Gangers, in acid-protection suits, bear down on the chapel. Rory responds to the sound of Jennifer screaming by deliberately separating from the group, against Amy's wishes. In the chapel, Amy and the Doctor discover a Ganger version of the Doctor.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the domestic garden is experienced as an intimate place in everyday life. With reference to Bachelard {{we seek to}} analyse prosaic pleasures and enchanting encounters that are revealed through multi-sensorial engagements and <b>emotional</b> <b>attachments</b> within the social/natural world. In particular we focus on three modalities of the everyday: work or tasks involved in gardening; that is, sensuous and embodied experiences explored through the notion of haptic perception; ‘cultivation’ {{in the sense of}} taking care of the garden, as well as caring for the self and others; and <b>emotional</b> <b>attachments</b> invoking body/place memories, especially of childhood gardens. To illustrate these themes we use garden narratives drawn from the Mass Observation Archive (MOA) ...|$|R

25|$|The {{prohibition}} of dual citizenship is a contentious issue in Singapore. As the economy becomes more globalized and Singaporeans more mobile, many Singaporeans have acquired foreign citizenships and reluctantly renounced their Singaporean citizenship {{even though they}} may feel a strong <b>emotional</b> <b>attachment</b> to Singapore. Immigrants who have been resident in Singapore for long periods and qualify for Singaporean citizenship may be reluctant to become naturalized citizens as it would mean giving up the citizenship of their native countries.|$|E

Children of Asian immigrants are likely to lose proficiency in their parents' native language while maintaining an <b>emotional</b> <b>attachment</b> to their family and heritage, which helps them develop their identity. While second generation Asian immigrants strive {{for the middle class}} white status, as many of their parents do, they develop a sensitivity to issues of race and ethnicity, which can be {{a major factor in the}} process of assimilation.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to restrictive behavior, parents {{are advised to}} provide daily sessions in which older children are treated {{as if they were}} babies to create attachment. The child is held in the caregiver's lap, rocked, hugged and kissed, and fed with a bottle and given sweets. These sessions are carried out at the caregiver's wish and not upon the child's request. Attachment therapists believe that reenactments of aspects of infant care have the power to rebuild damaged aspects of early development such as <b>emotional</b> <b>attachment.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hardy {{frequently}} conceived of, {{and wrote}} about, supernatural forces, {{particularly those that}} control the universe through indifference or caprice, a force he called The Immanent Will. He also showed in his writing some degree of fascination with ghosts and spirits. Even so, he retained a strong <b>emotional</b> <b>attachment</b> to the Christian liturgy and church rituals, particularly as manifested in rural communities, that {{had been such a}} formative influence in his early years, and Biblical references can be found woven throughout many of Hardy's novels.|$|E
25|$|Advocates of this {{treatment}} {{also believe that}} <b>emotional</b> <b>attachment</b> of a child to a caregiver begins during the prenatal period, during which the unborn child {{is aware of the}} mother's thoughts and emotions. If the mother is distressed by the pregnancy, especially if she considers abortion, the child responds with distress and anger that continue through postnatal life. If the child is separated from the mother after birth, no matter how early this occurs, the child again feels distress and rage that will block attachment to a foster or adoptive caregiver.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with how technology influences people’s <b>emotional</b> <b>attachments</b> to nature. The paper proposes two theoretical works in progress: a model which shows how emotions are constructed through social, technological and ecological experience; and a framework which proposes ways in which technology influences the construction of <b>emotional</b> <b>attachments</b> to nature. The aim of these models and frameworks are to enable designers to reframe their perceptions of ecological issues and recognise the behavioural, cultural and social complexities. The paper also hopes to further {{the relevance of the}} design and emotion field to sustainable development. The paper emerges from an investigation into an anthropological approach to ecodesign, and one of the key aims of presenting the paper is to understand its relevance of this enquiry to the design and emotion field...|$|R

25|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Ottoman Empire, the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922), and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, the population exchange agreement signed between Greece and Turkey resulted in the uprooting of all Greeks in modern Turkey (and Turks in Greece) from where many of them had lived for centuries. But due to the Greeks' strong <b>emotional</b> <b>attachment</b> to their first capital as well as the importance of the Ecumenical Patriarchate for Greek and worldwide orthodoxy, the Greek population of Istanbul was specifically exempted and allowed to stay in place. Nevertheless, this population began to decline, as evinced by demographic statistics.|$|E
25|$|Emotional target cues {{have been}} shown to {{eliminate}} age differences in prospective memory. For older participants, emotional prospective memory cues were better remembered than neutral cues. Whether the cues are positive or negative, strong <b>emotional</b> <b>attachment</b> makes the cue more self-relevant and easier to remember. For example, an aversive picture of a snake biting a person or a positive picture of a dog licking its owner are easier to remember because they evoke emotional responses, as opposed to a neutral picture of an animal that does not evoke an emotional response. It is speculated that the amygdala and hippocampus {{may play a role in}} this emotionally enhanced memory effect.|$|E
