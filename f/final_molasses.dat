25|$|After {{filtering}} {{any remaining}} solids, the clarified syrup is decolorized by filtration through activated carbon. Bone char or coal-based activated carbon is traditionally {{used in this}} role. Some remaining color-forming impurities adsorb to the carbon. The purified syrup is then concentrated to supersaturation and repeatedly crystallized in a vacuum, to produce white refined sugar. As in a sugar mill, the sugar crystals are separated from the molasses by centrifuging. Additional sugar is recovered by blending the remaining syrup with the washings from affination and again crystallizing to produce brown sugar. When no more sugar can be economically recovered, the <b>final</b> <b>molasses</b> still contains 2030 percent sucrose and 1525 percent glucose and fructose.|$|E

40|$|In {{the case}} of a {{back-end}} refinery, the final run-off or return syrup of 92 - 95 % purity and 75 ° brix is generally returned to the raw mill to be combined with raw syrup and boiled in the A-pans. Approximately 8 % of the input raw sugar brix into a refinery is returned, consequently locking up A-pan capacity and, in {{the case of}} a factory with marginal pan capacity, cane throughput is restricted. In addition, energy consumption is increased and sugar losses in <b>final</b> <b>molasses</b> are elevated.

40|$|There {{are always}} strong {{incentives}} for Process Management to achieve {{high levels of}} technical performance in a sugar factory. This is particularly so in the South African sugar industry where the ‘Division of Proceeds ’ system accentuates these incentives. The primary route to achieving good technical performance is usually close control of process operations, guided by detailed measures of factory performance. A critical area that often does not get sufficient attention is that of equipment and process design coupled {{with the need for}} proper maintenance. There are many constraints (e. g. financial, mechanical, space and construction) as well as a lack of skill and/or technical knowledge which can contribute to placing limits on the performance that is possible from a particular factory.

40|$|Pan stage {{operations}} {{have a major}} influence on the quality of shipment sugar production, the processing efficiency of the centrifugal and dryer stations, the sugar recovery from <b>final</b> <b>molasses</b> and the steam consumption of raw sugar factories. As well, for many factories, the production capacity of the pan stage is often the rate limiting station of the factory. Several Australian factories now operate with only one pan stage operator and a management tool such as a smart supervisory control system (SSCS) would assist the operator in making better decisions for managing the stage. The SSCS integrates the projected boil-on rates for syrup and molasses to each pan on the stage with the forecast production of syrup based on cane receival data and molasses from the centrifugals. By using the phase of each pan into an operational model the levels of syrup, A molasses and B molasses in the respective stock tanks are forecast and the information used to forewarn of potential problems or inefficiencies if current operating strategies are maintained. A hybrid fuzzy logic based expert system is employed to advise corrective procedures. While the system is not yet adopted commercially each phase of the development plan has been undertaken. Forecast tank levels have been found to compare favourably with actual tank levels. The SSCS should result in improved use of the installed equipment on the pan stage to achieve increased sugar recovery, improved sugar quality and reduced steam consumption while fulfilling the production rate requirements. One of the important benefits of the control system should be reduced variability in the steam consumption on the pan stage, leading to improved steam economy for the factory...|$|E

A commercial pig grower feed was used as the control (labeled T 0) representing the standard cereal based diet fed. The five treatments were replicated four times. These treatments were randomly allocated to the twenty pens in a complete randomized design. There were significant differences (P 0. 858), hot carcass weight (P> 0. 065), dressing % (P> 0. 118) and loin eye area (P> 0. 883) among treatments.

40|$|The {{installation}} of a continuous pan for the Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative of Florida factory was modelled using the Sugars™ computer program to evaluate changes {{in the process and}} potential changes in revenues. A model was constructed of the existing factory, and factory data were used to define the performance of equipment in the model and to estimate the solubility characteristics of the syrup by determining the coefficients for the Vavrinecz solubility function. Balance calculations from the model were then compared to the actual operation to verify the model. Next, the model was modified to use a continuous pan for 50 % of the ‘B ’ boiling and reduced sucrose supersaturation for the ‘A ’ and ‘C ’ boilings to compensate for the reduced loadings in these boilings from the {{installation of}} the continuous pan. The reduced loading in the ‘A ’ boiling would occur because an existing ‘B ’ batch pan would be moved to the ‘A ’ boiling when it is replaced by the new continuous pan, and the ‘C ’ boiling would be reduced because of a load reduction. Results from the simulation showed that the factory could expect an increase in process revenues with decreases in the <b>final</b> <b>molasses</b> purity and the bagasse consumed by the boilers. ‘B ’ centrifugal performance was then increased to see if the effect of more consistent crystal size variation in the ‘B ’ massecuite from the continuous pan would improve factory performance.

40|$|Fermentation {{feedstocks}} in {{the sugar}} industry are based on cane juice, B molasses or <b>final</b> <b>molasses.</b> Brazil has been producing ethanol by directing sugarcane juice to fermentation directly or using lower quality juice as a diluent with B molasses to prepare the fermentation broth. One issue that has received only limited interest particularly from outside Brazil is the most appropriate conditions for clarification of the juice going to fermentation. Irrespective of whether the juice supply is the total flow from the milling tandem or a diffuser station or {{a part of the}} total flow, removal of the insoluble solids is essential. However, the standard defecation process used by sugar factories around the world to clarify juice can introduce unwanted calcium ions and remove other nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen that are considered essential for the fermentation process. An investigation was undertaken by SRI to assess the effects on the constituents of cane juice when subjected to the typical clarification process in an Australian factory and what conditions would be needed to provide a clarified juice suitable for fermentation. Typical juices from one factory were clarified in laboratory trials under a range of pH conditions and the resulting clarified juices analysed. The results indicated that pH had a major effect on the residual concentrations of key constituents in the clarified juice and that the selected clarification conditions are determined by the nominated quality criteria of clarified juice feedstock for fermentation. Further trials were conducted in overseas factories to confirm the results obtained in Australia. It became apparent that the preferred specifications for clarified juice going to fermentation varied from country to country.

40|$|The {{research}} {{objective is to}} study {{of the effects of}} different cane conditions in the field on dextran level in cane juice (e. g. burning, chopping, delay between cutting and milling, and type of ratoon), and factors affecting levels of dextran during processing. The most important five criteria vis: polarization (pol), apparent purity, pH, viscosity and commercial cane sugar (C. C. S) of the cane juice besides dextran content of juice have been used to measure the cane deterioration. At the field level the results show that dextran formation was greater in chopped than long cane. Also the rate of deterioration of burnt cane is significantly higher than of green cane, with burnt chopped cane deterioration more rapid and extensive than in green chopped cane for the three types of cane; plantation, 1 st ratoon, and 2 nd ratoon. This was concomitant with a decrease in each of pol, apparent purity, pH, C. C. S, and an increase in viscosity which can be very good indicators to cane deterioration. Sugar losses from 11 % - 50 % were observed during the delay time to four days on the different cane samples. IV At the factory level the highest dextran was in mixed juice and decreased considerably during the process of sugar production. The greatest amount of dextran entering the factory goes to <b>final</b> <b>molasses</b> while only small amount goes to sugar. The dextran content correlated strongly with decreasing each of Brix, pol and apparent purity of most factory samples, and very strongly with decreasing of C. C. S, pH values and increasing of viscosity for all factory samples, which can be very good indicators to dextran presence during processing. Statistical analyses showed that for every 100 ppm of dextran in cane juice, there is an average sucrose loss of 0. 4 Kg /ton cane. So molasses purities have augmented to reach values as high as 43 %. Dextran removal percentage reaches up to 61. 97 % during the clarification of juice, and this increased to 74. 01 % with application of biocide. Mill sanitation in turn decreased dextran content by about 58 %, and then each 0. 05 % or (500 ppm) reduction in dextran content in the juice will result in a savings of 2 kg of sugar/ton of sugar produced. For data of “Algunied” cane sugar factory would potentially recover 0. 97 ton additional sugar/ day. With regard of process chemical costs, and for a 220 day crop recovers 213. 4 tons at SDG 2008. 00 / ton sugar, the gain is SDG 408892 / year...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 24 {{castrated}} male Creole {{were used for}} digestibility studies on three sugarcane (SC) products: <b>final</b> <b>molasses,</b> SC juice and ground SC. Digestibility of macronutrients were determined in three consecutive experimental trials between 35 and 60 kg BW. The first trial measured {{the effect of a}} constant rate of incorporation of those SC products in a control diet (23 % on a dry matter (DM) basis) on digestibility of energy and nutrients. The second and the third trials were designed {{to determine the effects of}} increasing rates of inclusion of SC juice and ground SC in the control diet on the digestibility of nutrients and energy. The DM content of molasses, SC juice and ground SC were 74. 3 %, 19. 3 % and 25. 8 %, respectively. Free sugar contents were 73. 8 %, 81. 6 % and 51. 5 % of DM for molasses, SC juice and ground SC, respectively. In contrast with molasses and SC juice, NDF content of ground SC was very high (40. 3 % DM). Energy digestibility coefficients (DC) were 99. 0 % and 83. 6 % for SC juice and molasses, respectively. For ground SC, amounts and composition of intakes differed from feed allowance as a consequence of chewing-then-spitting out most of the fibrous contents of ground SC. Expressed as a percentage of energy intake and energy allowance, DC of energy for ground SC were 68. 6 % and 31. 9 %, respectively. On an intake basis, digestible energy (DE) and metabolisable energy (ME) values were higher for SC juice (17. 3 and 17. 2 MJ/kg DM, respectively) than for molasses (13. 1 and 12. 6 MJ/kg DM, respectively) or ground SC (12. 3 and 11. 8 MJ/kg DM, respectively). On an allowance basis, the corresponding values for ground SC were only 5. 7 and 5. 6 MJ/kg DM, respectively. The gradual inclusion rate of SC juice in the diet up to 66 % resulted in a linear increase of the DC of the diet organic matter and energy (P < 0. 001) by 0. 10 % per 1 % in SC juice DM. On the other hand, the partial substitution of the control diet by ground SC up to 74 % resulted in a linear (P < 0. 05) reduction of digestibility of nutrients and energy.

40|$|The Republic of Mauritius {{comprises}} a main {{island of}} an area of 1870 km 2 at latitude 200 south and longitude 580 east and several outer islands, all of volcanic origin. Mauritius has no known oil, natural gas or coal reserves and is therefore heavily dependent on imported energy sources. In 2012, some 458 ktoe of energy were used for transportation, representing an increase from 391 ktoe in 2009 and 418 ktoe of energy in 2010. The consumption of gasoline increased from 121 ktoe to 128 ktoe (+ 5. 8 %) and that of diesel oil from 155 ktoe to 162 ktoe (+ 4. 5 %). The consumption of aviation fuel increased from 110 ktoe in 2009 compared to 123 ktoe in 2010 (+ 11. 8 %) to 146 ktoe in 2012. In Mauritius the transport sector is the heaviest energy consumer, accounting for 48 % of total energy imports and pollution problems in term of vehicular emissions which are more acute in towns where there is heavy vehicular traffic. Mauritius as an island state cannot {{have the benefit of}} interconnection facilities and the reliance on fossil fuels can only impact severely on the island in case of crisis In 2006, a comprehensive set of strategies regrouped under the Multi Annual Adaptation Strategy (MAAS) was thus prepared jointly between the Government of Mauritius and the stakeholders in the sugar sector with the objective to investigate the environmental challenges and considerations to produce a comprehensive set of strategies to maintain the commercial viability and sustainability of the sugar sector. The plan that emerged from the MAAS comprised several measures including the transformation of the sugar industry into a sugarcane cluster coupled with the production of a minimum of 30 million litres of ethanol annually. One local ethanol manufacturer is exporting ethanol on regular basis to foreign markets. Export of ethanol has the added advantage of bringing foreign currency to the country and would be encouraged. In line with the Maurice Ile Durable project, to provide with a long-term strategy to progressively reduce the country’s dependence on fossil fuel, the implementation of an ethanol plant in the south of the island, after centralization of the sugar factory activities, has been considered. A case study has been carried out for setting up a 15 million liters dehydrated ethanol plant annexed to the sugar factory.   The cost analysis showed that the annual revenue from the ethanol plant will be $ 17, 250, 000 and that the payback period will be of 2. 9 years. It has been concluded that centralization of sugarcane industry provides with feedstock, with steam and power and minimize transportation costs, thereby increasing the operational and economical cost of ethanol production plant. The amount of molasses that will be produced at each cluster will be some 45 000 tons of molasses and for optimized operating plant, producing more than 20 million liters of dehydrated ethanol, <b>final</b> <b>molasses</b> will have to be outsourced from the other sugar factories on the island...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographyAbstract Guyana {{depends on}} {{imported}} fuel {{to meet the}} needs of its transport sector. In recent years, pricesof derivatives of petroleum have increased significantly, further widening the current account deficit. In 2005, fuel accounted for 29 % of the value of imports of the country. The technology of using ethanol mixed with gasoline in four-stroke cycle engines is wellknown, and, does not require any changes in vehicles for levels of ethanol in the mixture up to 10 %. This technology is used in many countries with vehicle fleets, similar to those of Guyana. The sugarcane industry of Guyana constitutes one of the most important economic activities of the country and is one of the main sources of foreign exchange. However, it is subject to very significant market risks, associated with changes in the Sugar Protocol and the reduction of preferential prices on the market of the European Union. A diversity of raw materials, sweet or starchy, may be considered for the production of ethanol. However, when considering costs, available technology and energy productivity, sugarcane (directly as juice or as molasses); presents the most attractive option. In time, other possibilities may be considered. In the most conservative scenario (use of <b>final</b> <b>molasses,</b> producing 8. 8 liters of ethanol per ton of processed sugarcane);, it is estimated that 30. 8 million liters of ethanol may be obtained annually from the sugarcane industry in Guyana. This would be nearly 3 times the anticipated demand of 11. 5 million liters, if a mixture of gasoline with 10 % ethanol were to be used in Guyana's vehicles. If other raw materials with higher productivity (sugarcane juice or primary molasses); are considered, the available potential ethanol would increase proportionally. In 2005, the export price of molasses was US$ 83 per ton. Each ton of molasses can produce 260 liters of ethanol. This implies an estimated opportunity cost of US$ 0. 392 per liter of ethanol. This is lower than the US$ 0. 463 per liter that Guyana paid for its imported gasoline in 2005, indicating the competitiveness of the biofuel. Ethanol from molasses has consistently been price competitive in the past few years, even without consideration of positive externalities associated with it. If Guyana were to utilize a mixture of gasoline with 10 % ethanol, a distillery producing 65 thousand liters of ethanol daily would be required to satisfy national demand. This would require an investment of approximately US$ 6. 5 million. It would result in a net earning of approximately US$ 800. 000 and annual savings of US$ 5. 4 million on the energy import bill, at 2005 prices. Present conditions of the energy and the agro-industrial sector of Guyana provide an excellent opportunity for the production and use of ethanol as a source of fuel in the country. Furthermore, in addition to price considerations, it is important to be able to produce locally part of the national energy demand, using available natural resources and proven technologies. This would also stimulate diversification in the sugarcane industry which is currently exposed to well known challenges. Moreover, the use of ethanol as a source of energy would have significant environmental advantages. All together, these conditions make a decidedly sufficient and robust case to promote the use of ethanol for energy security in Guyana. The promotion of ethanol as a source of fuel in Guyana requires the collaboration of all institutions and stakeholders arriving at an operational mechanism for the introduction of ethanol within the energy sector. For such an initiative to be successful clear timelines should be established and commitments obtained. It should also include a component for building public awareness as well as involvement of the local science and technology community...|$|E
