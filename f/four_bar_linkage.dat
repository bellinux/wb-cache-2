2500|$|Before the {{development}} of the double acting piston, the linkage to the beam and the piston rod had been by means of a chain, which meant that power could only be applied in one direction, by pulling. This was effective in engines that were used for pumping water, but the double action of the piston meant that it could push as well as pull. This was not possible as long as the beam and the rod were connected by a chain. Furthermore, {{it was not possible to}} connect the piston rod of the sealed cylinder directly to the beam, because while the rod moved vertically in a straight line, the beam was pivoted at its centre, with each side inscribing an arc. To bridge the conflicting actions of the beam and the piston, Watt developed his parallel motion. This masterpiece of engineering uses a <b>four</b> <b>bar</b> <b>linkage</b> coupled with a pantograph to produce the required straight line motion much more cheaply than if he had used a slider type of linkage.

50|$|During the Industrial Revolution, {{mechanisms}} for converting rotary into linear motion were widely adopted in industrial and mining machinery, locomotives and metering devices. Such devices had to combine engineering simplicity {{with a high}} degree of accuracy, and the ability to operate at speed for lengthy periods. For many purposes approximate linear motion is an acceptable substitute for exact linear motion. Perhaps the best known example is the Watt <b>four</b> <b>bar</b> <b>linkage,</b> invented by the Scottish engineer James Watt in 1784.|$|E
50|$|The theorem {{states for}} a given coupler-curve there exist three four-bar {{linkages}}, three geared five-bar linkages, and more six-bar linkages which will generate the same path.

40|$|Mechanisms are {{means of}} power {{transmission}} {{as well as}} motion transformers. A fourbar mechanism consists mainly of four planar links connected with four revolute joints. The input is usually given as rotary motion of a link and output {{can be obtained from}} the motion of another link or a coupler point. Straight line motion from a <b>four</b> <b>bar</b> <b>linkages</b> has been used in several ways as in a dwell mechanism and as a linkage to vehicle suspension. This paper studies the straight line motion obtained from planar four-bar mechanisms and optimizes the design to produce the maximized straight line portion of the coupler point curve. The equations of motion for four different four-bar mechanisms will be derived and dimensional requirements for these mechanisms will be obtained in order to produce the straight line motion. A numerical procedure will be studied and computer codes that generate the coupler curves will be presented. Following the numerical results study, a synthesis procedure will be given to help a designer in selecting the optimized straight line motion based on design criteria...|$|R
50|$|Whilst the Clever {{vehicle was}} {{intended}} to use a low emission engine burning compresses natural gas, the research prototype at the University of Bath uses a 13 kW 176cc single cylinder engine taken from BMW C1 scooter. The original CVT gearbox is retained (albeit modified to provide a power take off to drive the pump for the tilt hydraulics); belt drives are used to transmit power to the two rear wheels. Rear suspension is by way of independent trailing arms, adjustable Öhlins spring/damper units and an anti-roll bar. The front wheel is suspended by a leading <b>four</b> <b>bar</b> <b>linkage</b> with a single Öhlins spring/damper unit and uses a hub-centric steering system. A single track-rod transmits steer inputs to the front wheel from the output arm of a worm-gear steering box, the driver’s steer inputs are transmitted to the steering box via a modified wheel and column sourced from a BMW car.|$|E
50|$|Placoderms were a {{class of}} fish, heavily {{armoured}} {{at the front of}} their body, which first appeared in the fossil records during the Silurian about 430 million years ago. Initially they very successful, diversifying remarkably during the Devonian. They became extinct {{by the end of that}} period, about 360 million years ago. Their largest species, Dunkleosteus terrelli, measured up to 10 m and weighed 3.6 t. It possessed a <b>four</b> <b>bar</b> <b>linkage</b> mechanism for jaw opening that incorporated connections between the skull, the thoracic shield, the lower jaw and the jaw muscles joined together by movable joints. This mechanism allowed Dunkleosteus terrelli to achieve a high speed of jaw opening, opening their jaws in 20 milliseconds and completing the whole process in 50-60 milliseconds, comparable to modern fishes that use suction feeding to assist in prey capture. They could also produce high bite forces when closing the jaw, estimated at 6000 N at the tip and 7400 N at the blade edge in the largest individuals. The pressures generated in those regions were high enough to puncture or cut through cuticle or dermal armour suggesting that Dunkleosteus terrelli was perfectly adapted to prey on free-swimming, armoured prey like arthropods, ammonites, and other placoderms.|$|E

He was very proud of his solution.Having the beam connected to the piston shaft by a means that applied force alternately in both directions also meant that it was possible to use the motion of the beam to turn a wheel. The most simple solution to transforming the action of the beam into a rotating motion was to connect the beam to a wheel by a crank, but because another party had patent rights on the use of the crank, Watt was obliged to come up with another solution. He adopted the epicyclic sun and planet gear system suggested by an employee William Murdoch, only later reverting, once the patent rights had expired, to the more familiar crank seen on most engines today. The main wheel attached to the crank was large and heavy, serving as a flywheel which, once set in motion, by its momentum maintained a constant power and smoothed the action of the alternating strokes. To its rotating central shaft, belts and gears could be attached to drive a great variety of machinery.|$|E

Because of this LIAB (Lima Innovation AB) wants to examine the possibilities to construct a new grapple that solves this problem. The goal of this thesis work is to construct a grapple, which fits existing forwarders, that minimizes the digging motion.

40|$|A {{suspension}} system {{was designed to}} make The Rickshaw Bank's bicycle-powered rickshaws more comfortable for the drivers. A <b>four</b> <b>bar</b> <b>linkage</b> with a rising rate spring {{was chosen as the}} design. An unconventional material-tire rubber-was used as the spring material because it is inexpensive, requires limited tooling, and is in vast supply near The Rickshaw Bank's factory in Assam, India. Different configurations of tire rubber were tested to see how the size, length, and placement of the spring affected the system's performance. Bode Plots of the system's response function were generated for each configuration. The functionality of the {{suspension system}} within the 10 - 20 Hz range was of premier importance because it is in this frequency range that the bicycle-powered rickshaws most often operate, based on their speed and the road conditions the rickshaw regularly encounters. Ultimately, it was demonstrated that the placement of the spring within the suspension system had the greatest effect on the system's response. The configuration that applied the greatest moment to the top link of the <b>four</b> <b>bar</b> <b>linkage</b> performed best. Surprisingly, any advantages arising from varying the geometry of the tire rubber pieces were lost to friction and the effect of the ply embedded in the tire rubber. In order to properly verify the optimal spring placement and tire rubber spring geometry, a suspension system that takes this paper's findings into account should be tested with a rickshaw in India. by Heather E.
