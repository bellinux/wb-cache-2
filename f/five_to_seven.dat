5|$|A limerick is a {{poem that}} {{consists}} of five lines and is often humorous. Rhythm {{is very important in}} limericks for the first, second and fifth lines must have seven to ten syllables. However, the third and fourth lines only need <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven.</b> All of the lines must rhyme and have the same rhythm.|$|E
5|$|A thru-hike {{generally}} requires <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> months, {{although some}} {{have done it}} in three months, and several trail runners have completed the trail in less time. Trail runners typically tackle the AT with automobile support teams, without backpacks, and without camping in the woods.|$|E
5|$|Customers {{order at}} the counter and are served at their table, usually within <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> minutes. The average check is {{approximately}} $8 per person. The restaurants use soft lighting, furniture made from recycled bamboo and have bench seating and community tables. Orders can be made online, to dine-in, or to-go.|$|E

5|$|Foal: A {{horse of}} either sex {{less than one}} year old. A nursing foal is {{sometimes}} called a suckling and a foal that has been weaned is called a weanling. Most domesticated foals are weaned at <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> months of age, although foals can be weaned at four months with no adverse physical effects.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is still}} {{commonly}} parboiled before preparation, evidence suggests that even this procedure may not make Gyromitra esculenta entirely safe for consumption. When consumed, the principal active agent, gyromitrin, is hydrolyzed into the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine (MMH). The toxin affects the liver, central nervous system, and sometimes the kidneys. Symptoms of poisoning involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. Severe cases may lead to delirium, coma and death after <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> days.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, the Belgian {{government}} had planned an emergency system of rationing, which was implemented {{on the day}} of the German invasion. The German occupying authority used Belgium's reliance on food imports as a bargaining tool. The amount of food permitted to Belgian citizens was roughly two-thirds of that allowed to comparable German citizens and was amongst the lowest in occupied Europe. On average, scarcity of food led to a loss of <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> kilograms of weight per Belgian in 1940 alone.|$|E

5|$|Edmontosaurus is {{currently}} regarded as having two valid species: type species E. regalis, and E. annectens. E. regalis is known {{only from the}} Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, dating from the late Campanian stage of the late Cretaceous period. At least a dozen individuals are known, including seven skulls with associated postcrania, and <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> other skulls. The species formerly known as Thespesius edmontoni or Anatosaurus edmontoni represents immature individuals.|$|E
5|$|Not {{commonly}} cultivated, it adapts {{readily to}} garden conditions and tolerates most soils in part-shade or full sun. The colours of the inflorescences in bud, {{and timing of}} flowers into winter give it horticultural value, as does its reddish new growth. Larger plants have taller flower spikes. It is propagated readily from seed, with young plants taking <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> years to flower from seed. Pruning can improve the shrub's appearance, {{and it is a}} potential bonsai subject.|$|E
5|$|Noted {{hurricane}} experts Philip J. Klotzbach, William M. Gray, {{and their}} associates at Colorado State University issue forecasts of hurricane activity each year, separately from NOAA. Klotzbach's team, formerly led by Gray, determined {{the average number}} of storms per season between 1950 and 2000 to be 9.6tropical storms, 5.9hurricanes, and 2.3major hurricanes (storms exceeding Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale). A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 9 to 12named storms, of which <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> reach hurricane strength and one to three become major hurricanes.|$|E
60|$|This did {{not matter}} much to the equable {{temperature}} of Miss Marlett; but it did matter {{a great deal to}} her shivering pupils, three of whom were just speeding their morning toilette, by the light of one candle, at the pleasant hour of <b>five</b> minutes <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> on a frosty morning.|$|R

Ferry and fast ferry services are also operated from the town center to nearby islands. The 44-room Thon Hotel Torghatten is located next to the airport.|$|E
5|$|The Wicklow Way is waymarked in both {{directions}} and can be started at Marlay Park or Clonegal. The trail is marked with square black posts with an image, in yellow, of a walking man and a directional arrow. This image, copied from the symbol used for waymarking the Ulster Way, has become the traditional waymarking symbol {{for all of the}} National Waymarked Trails in Ireland. Brown fingerposts are used on sections that follow roads. The Way is typically completed in <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> days.|$|E
5|$|The {{event was}} widely {{cited as the}} trigger event for July 2009 Ürümqi riots, which ostensibly started as a {{peaceful}} street protest demanding official action over the two Uyghurs who died in Shaoguan. Following trials in October 2009, one person was executed and several others sentenced to terms between life imprisonment and <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> years.|$|E

5|$|Without treatment, {{an acute}} {{attack of gout}} usually {{resolves}} in <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> days; however, 60% of people have a second attack within one year. Those with gout {{are at increased risk}} of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and kidney and cardiovascular disease and thus are at increased risk of death. It is unclear whether medications that lower urate affect cardiovascular disease risks. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, but some of the increased risk appears to be independent.|$|E
5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10–40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> days. There is some evidence that chlorhexidine mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.|$|E
5|$|Early {{forms of}} {{xylophone}} {{such as the}} atranatrana are found throughout the island and {{are believed to have}} come across with the original Indonesian settlers. The earliest of these is played uniquely by a pair of women, one of whom sits with her legs outstretched together and the bars of the xylophone resting across her legs rather than on a separate resonator box. Each woman strikes the atranatrana with a pair of sticks, one keeping the beat while the second plays a melody. The xylophone bars range from <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> in number and are made of differing lengths of a rot-resistant wood called hazomalagny. A similar xylophone called katiboky is still played in the southwest among the Vezo and Bara ethnic groups.|$|E
5000|$|Ceraunius Tholus {{is on the}} Tharsis rise, {{also called}} the Tharsis bulge. [...] Tharsis is a land of great volcanoes. Olympus Mons is the tallest known volcano. Ascraeus Mons and Pavonis Mons are at least 320 km across and are over 10 km above the plateau that they sit on. The plateau is <b>five</b> <b>to</b> four <b>seven</b> {{kilometers}} above the zero altitude of Mars.|$|R
25|$|In 2012, Donaire fought Vázquez Jr. After twelve rounds, Donaire had {{scores of}} 117–110 and 117-110. Surprisingly, the third judge scored 115–112 {{in favour of}} Vázquez Jr. Donaire landed sixty percent of his power shots and out-landed Vázquez Jr in rounds one <b>to</b> <b>five</b> and <b>seven</b> <b>to</b> twelve and was awarded the WBO super bantamweight title. In the ninth round, Donaire was knocked down {{for the first time}} in his {{professional}} career. Donaire became the second Filipino (after Manny Pacquiao) to win championships in four different divisions.|$|R

5|$|For {{the role}} of Apu, Ray advertised in {{newspapers}} for boys of ages <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven.</b> None of the candidates who auditioned fulfilled Ray's expectations, but his wife spotted a boy in their neighbourhood, and this boy, Subir Banerjee, was cast as Apu. (The surname {{of three of the}} main actors happened to be Banerjee, but they were not related to each other). The hardest role to fill was the wizened old Indir. Ray eventually found Chunibala Devi, a retired stage actress living in one of Calcutta's red-light districts, as the ideal candidate. Several minor roles were played by the villagers of Boral, where Pather Panchali was filmed.|$|E
5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the U.S. Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). According to CSU, the average season between 1950 and 2000 had 9.6tropical storms, 5.9hurricanes, and 2.3major hurricanes (storms exceeding Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale). A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 9 to 12named storms, of which <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> reach hurricane strength and one to three become major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|In Antananarivo and {{throughout}} the highlands, Merina and Betsileo families practice the famadihana, an ancestor reburial ceremony. This ceremony typically occurs <b>five</b> <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> years {{after the death of}} a relative and is celebrated by removing the relative's lamba-wrapped remains from the family tomb, rewrapping it with fresh silk shrouds and returning it to the tomb. Relatives, friends and neighbors are invited {{to take part in the}} music, dancing and feasting that accompanies the event. The famadihana is costly; many families sacrifice higher living standards to set aside money for the ceremony.|$|E
50|$|That {{same year}} Lescot {{extended}} his presidential term from <b>five</b> years <b>to</b> <b>seven.</b> By 1946, {{his attempts to}} muzzle the opposition press sparked fierce student demonstrations; a revolt broke out in Port-au-Prince. Black-empowerment noirists, Marxists, and populist leaders joined forces in opposition. Crowds protested outside the National Palace, workers went on strike, and the homes of authorities were ransacked. Lescot's mulatto-dominated government was highly resented by Haiti's predominately black military Garde.|$|R
50|$|The five (or seven) {{seats in}} the Ascension Island Council are elected by first-past-the-post voting, with voters allowed to cast up <b>to</b> <b>five</b> (or <b>seven)</b> votes respectively.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2016, Ducey signed {{legislation}} {{to expand the}} court from <b>five</b> justices <b>to</b> <b>seven</b> justices. This legislation was [...] "championed by Republicans but decried by Democrats as an effort by the governor to pack the court with his nominees." [...] In November 2016, Ducey appointed Arizona Court of Appeals Judge Andrew Gould and state Solicitor General John Lopez IV to the two new seats. Lopez is the state's first Latino justice.|$|R
