40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to suggest the {{possibility}} of modal shift by developing a mobile harbor (MH) with a container crane on board for container transport. As per the technical specification of MH, it has 8 ∼ 15 knots speed, 250 TEU laden capacity, 4 meters draft, 92 meters LOA, 26 meters breadth, 30 moves handling rate capacity per hour. With this specification, the strong point of MH is to reduce port time of the mother ship by implementing a cross-docking handling system alongside the mother ship or <b>feeder</b> <b>ship.</b> Furthermore, due to the crane on board, the berthing place will be expanded, i. e. MH is able to approach general cargo handling berth without a dedicated quay crane. The paper concludes that MH may be used as a useful modal shift tool. The transit distance of 100 nautical miles is a decisive point to win the road mode regardless of the ship's speed. If the distance is more than 100 nautical miles, mobile harbor has the competitive advantage in pulling cargo from road transportation mode. Even though the result of analysis shows a positive signal for modal shift, the real situation does not go that way. That means modal shift has several attributes applicable to the real world...|$|E
40|$|Investigation of feeder ships {{worldwide}} {{has identified}} South East Asian and the Caribbean as transshipment markets open to <b>feeder</b> <b>ship</b> replacement with {{a need for}} improved operational efficiency. In response to this challenge an environmentally sustainable feeder-container ship concept has been developed for the 2020 container market. The concept utilises higher speed and larger capacity than typical feeder ships, whilst halving the fleet size. The use of low-carbon and zero-sulphur fuel (liquefied natural gas) and improvements in operational efficiency (cargo handling and scheduling) mean predicted Greenhouse gas emissions should fall by 42 % and 40 % in the two selected operational regions. The predicted daily cost savings are respectively 27 % and 33 % in South East Asian and the Caribbean. A Multi-wing sail system also contributes to these savings whilst providing the additional benefit of motion damping. Propulsion and manoeuvrability is provided through a contra-rotating podded drive. Performance predictions have been made based on physical testing of both hull form and sail system. Use of ship-borne gantry cranes and the podded based manoeuvrability permit reduced times in port, thus improving operational efficiency. A typical round trip voyage has been simulated taking into account: realistic wind and wave environment data; physical model testing data and a representative operational profile including port operations. The fast feeder-container ship is a proposed as a viable future method of container transshipment...|$|E

The assembly and customization of traded goods are increasingly decentralized around the globe. The frequency of their transportation and exchange is increasing. The phenomenon is of container freights, specifically: transshipment. Trans-shipment ports are no portals to cities, but are increasingly becoming autonomous global entities. The ports are mere switchboards, an exchange mechanism between ships. Transshipment is the fastest growing shipping market. Ships are getting bigger. Ports are expanding and dredging deeper, as they struggle today with overcapacity. New terminals are built, as economies of scale reach saturation in existing ports. The form of the global infrastructure is changing. In response, a new infrastructural move is necessary: a Megaport for transshipment. The Megaport is a transshipment port solely for ultra large containerships.

40|$|Puerto Rico {{is one of}} the Greater Antilles, {{situated}} in the Caribbean. To the west lie the other, larger islands of the Greater Antilles, while to the east the islands of the Lesser Antilles are situated. The largest port of Puerto Rico, the port of San Juan, is presently the number 17 container port {{in the world and the}} largest port in the Caribbean region. The greater part of the container throughput, about 95 %, consists of containers originating from or destined for Puerto Rico. The remaining part does not leave the terminal by land, but is transferred from ship to ship, which is referred to as transshipment. Puerto Rico has a keen interest in becoming a major ransshipment hub in the Caribbean region. It would like to handle the ships sailing on the main sea trade routes. Containers coming from such ships would be distributed to the region by <b>feeder</b> <b>ships,</b> and this would result in additional throughput and possibilities for value added services. Presently the handling of such ships by the port of San Juan is obstructed for a number of reasons. Ships sailing on the main routes require large drafts. Having a draft of only 28 feet, not even the smallest ships of those routes could enter the port of San Juan. In fact, 60 to 70 % of the vessels already have difficulties in entering the port because of the limited draft. Furthermore, the port is reported to be inefficient and expensive. This report analyses the potential of Puerto Rico to become a major transshipment hub and the requirements of such a hub. Two development options for the container port sector are worked out. In the first option dredging and restructuring of a part of the port of San Juan are suggested, which will enable ships to apply economies of scale and the restructured part to grow 40 % in container throughput. However, the suggested improvements alone will not attract transshipment. The quays allow a draft of 41 feet which is still not sufficient to accommodate the large vessels, as employed on the primary routes. Further no land is available for valued added services. Finally some aspects are expected to be hard to change, for example the labour constraints, for which the port of San Juan will remain expensive.
