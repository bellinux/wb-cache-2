The 1951 [...] "Marston Motorcade" [...] consisted of two outboard motorboats and three stock Chris-Craft Speedsters. The 18-foot aluminum hull outboard motorboat <b>June</b> <b>Bug</b> was piloted by Jimmy Jordan and the second boat of the same design, the Twin, was piloted by Rod Sanderson. The two outboards were powered by twin 25-horsepower Evinrude outboard motors.

50|$|Three years {{previous}} to the <b>June</b> <b>Bugs</b> flight, the Wrights {{had made}} flights {{of up to}} 24 miles (38 km) without official witnesses. However the Wrights would have been required to install wheels and dispense with a catapult launch {{to compete for the}} 1908 prize.|$|R
50|$|A solid silver sculpted trophy, and $25,000 in cash, {{would be}} awarded to whoever {{made the first}} public flight of over 1 {{kilometer}} (3,280 ft).

5000|$|Hudler {{earned his}} [...] "Bug-Eater" [...] moniker in St. Louis, when {{during a game}} he picked up an {{enormous}} <b>June</b> <b>bug</b> off his cap; when dared to eat it by Cardinals teammate Tom Pagnozzi, Hudler got {{the players in the}} dugout involved and they paid him $800 to eat the bug (which he did).|$|R
5000|$|It {{was named}} by Dr. Alexander Graham Bell after the common Phyllophaga, a beetle known colloquially in North America as the [...] "June bug," [...] because <b>June</b> <b>bugs</b> were {{observed}} to fly similarly to aircraft: they have large stiff outer wings for gliding, and more delicate smaller propeller-like wings that do the actual propulsion.|$|R
50|$|In 1908, U.S. inventor, {{businessman}} and engine builder Glenn Curtiss flew an aileron-controlled aircraft.

50|$|The <b>June</b> <b>bug</b> {{epidemic}} {{serves as}} {{a classic example of}} hysterical contagion. In 1962 a mysterious disease broke out in a dressmaking department of a US textile factory. The symptoms included numbness, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting. Word of a bug in the factory that would bite its victims and cause them to develop the above symptoms quickly spread.|$|R
