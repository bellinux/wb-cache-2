40|$|An ad-hoc {{network is}} the {{co-operative}} engagement {{of a collection}} of mobile nodes without the required intervention of any centralised access point or existing infrastructure. Several routing protocols for mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) have been proposed. Most of the existing routing protocols are single path routing protocols which establish a single routing path between the source and destination nodes. This results in rapid depletion of battery power of the nodes that comprise the path between the source and destination nodes. This reduces the lifetime of the network. The proposed protocol overcomes these drawbacks by following a hybrid approach to routing of data packets and establishing multiple zone disjoint paths between the source and <b>destination</b> <b>zones.</b> The proposed protocol is based on the Zone based Hierarchical Link State Routing Protocol (ZHLS). The proposed work eliminates the need for the global broadcasting of zone LSP's and the need for the interzone routing tables used in ZHLS. The proposed protocol establishes multiple zone disjoint paths between the source and <b>destination</b> <b>zones.</b> The packets are encrypted by making use of a symmetric cryptosystem. The simulation results show that the proposed work outperforms the existing ZHLS and provides a flexible, efficient and effective approach for routing packets in mobile ad-hoc networks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Position-based routing {{protocols}} forward packets solely based on geographical information about nodes. Therefore, in irregular topologies where routing along {{a straight line}} to the destination is not feasible due to voids, they choose suboptimal paths. In this paper, we propose a position-based protocol MRA that tries to capture the global network topology {{on a large scale}} from overheard data packets and, if necessary, actively transmits explorer packets to find shorter paths. The required additional memory at the nodes can be kept small by applying a fish-eye like view on the network, where distant areas are aggregated to zones. A node does only forward packets in a certain direction for a given <b>destination</b> <b>zone</b> when it also has previously received packets from this direction and originating in that <b>destination</b> <b>zone.</b> Thus, MRA does not route packets along infeasible paths where packets cannot be forwarded directly to the destination due to voids. Simulation results show that MRA is able to find up to 40 % shorter paths than other position-based protocol in irregular network topologies.

30|$|The {{difference}} between concentrating generated trips and attracted trips is mainly {{due to the}} impact of the access-egress phase to/from the mass transit system. While the access is considered an easi phase, because the trip from the origin zone to the transit stop can be done using different modes (walk, bike & ride, park & ride, kiss & ride etc.), the egress phase from the final stop to the destination is constrained by the transit and pedestrian network defined around the <b>destination</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} {{destination}} choice is developed {{in this study}} employing "prospective utility" of a <b>destination</b> <b>zone</b> as its attraction measure. The prospective utility accounts for future dependency of destination choice and makes possible relevant treatment of interdependent choices in a trip chain. A parameter {{is included in the}} model to represent the magnitude of the future dependency. Empirical estimation results show that destination choice is in fact future dependent and coefficients of travel time and zonal attribute variables may be biased if this depedency is not accounted for. ...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{interaction}} models commonly use discrete zones {{to represent}} locations. The computational {{requirements of the}} models normally arise with {{the square of the}} number of zones or worse. For computationally intensive models, such as land usetransport interaction models and activity-based models for city regions, this dependency of zone size is a long-standing problem that has not disappeared even with increasing computation speed in PCsit still forces modelers to compromise on the spatial resolution and extent of model coverage {{as well as on the}} rigor and depth of model-based analysis. This article introduces a new type of discrete zone system, with the objective of reducing the time for estimating and applying spatial interaction models while maintaining their accuracy. The premise of the new system is that the appropriate size of <b>destination</b> <b>zones</b> depends on the distance to their origin zone: at short distances, spatial accuracy is important and <b>destination</b> <b>zones</b> must be small; at longer distances, knowing the precise location becomes less important and zones can be larger. The new method defines a specific zone map for every origin zone; each origin zone becomes the focus of its own map, surrounded by small zones nearby and large zones farther away. We present the theoretical formulation of the new method and test it with a model of commuting in England. The results of the new method are equivalent to those of the conventional model, despite reducing the number of zone pairs by 96 % and the computation time by 70 %...|$|R

For example, understanding the microcosmic route selection behavior of passengers can help understand why passengers use buses or multimode transport between two transfer zones with subway connection; investigating the land use types of <b>destination</b> <b>zones</b> can help further understand different temporal features of travel demand to specific destination areas.|$|R
50|$|The actual {{analysis}} tool {{used in the}} US {{is called}} the Urban Transportation Modeling System (UTMS), though it {{is often referred to}} as the four-step process. As its nickname suggestions, UTMS has four steps: trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice and trip/route assignment. In trip generation, the region is subdivided into a large number of smaller units of analysis called traffic analysis zones (TAZs). Based on the number and characteristics of the households in each zone, a certain number of trips is generated. In the second step, trip distribution, trips are separated out into categories based on their origin and purpose: generally, these categories are home-based work, home-based other and non-home based. In each of three categories, trips are matched to origin and <b>destination</b> <b>zones</b> using the data that has been collected.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper proposes {{different}} policy scenarios to cut CO 2 emissions {{caused by}} the urban mobility of passengers. More precisely, we compare {{the effects of the}} ‘direct tool’ of carbon tax, to a combination of ‘indirect tools’ – not originally aimed at reducing CO 2 (i. e. congestion charging, parking charges and a reduction in public transport travel time) in terms of CO 2 impacts through a change in the modal split. In our model, modal choices depend on individual characteristics, trip features (including the effects of policy tools), and land use at origin and <b>destination</b> <b>zones.</b> Personal “CO 2 emissions budgets” resulting from the trips observed in the metropolitan area of Lille (France) in 2006 are calculated and compared to the situation related to the different policy scenarios. We find that an increase of 50 % in parking charges combined with a cordon toll of € 1. 20 and a 10 % travel time decrease in public transport services (made after recycling toll-revenues) is the winning scenario. The combined effects of all the policy scenarios are superior to their separate effects...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{equilibrium}} problem of asymmetric transport networks with elastic demand and capacity constraints. It shows that a homogeneous linear relationship exists between the operator of the variational inequality usually considered {{in the theory of}} transport networks and the gradients of the constraints. This linear relationship provides confirmation of a result obtained in a previous paper: a solution of the variational inequality may not be an equilibrium solution, and a transport network may have no equilibrium pattern which satisfies the capacity constraints. However additional costs can be imposed on some network links, {{in such a way that}} a solution of the variational inequality becomes the unique equilibrium solution for the transport network. The paper shows that these additional costs are linear combinations of the coefficients of the gradients of the capacity constraints, and that the way they can be applied to actual transport networks essentially depends on the way the latter are managed. A method of computing both the equilibrium flow pattern and the additional costs is presented, and is applied to the actual networks of three italian cities, where the additional costs are imposed on drivers as parking taxes at the <b>destination</b> <b>zones</b> of the central areas. ...|$|R

As a check, we compared the results of estimation at the country level with those at the zonal level. Both gave elasticities of comparable magnitude.|$|E
