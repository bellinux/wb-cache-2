A {{greater understanding of}} how green roofs perform with respect to fundamental stormwater management criteria, such as stormwater retention and peak flow attenuation is required. This study investigated the impact that changing climates have on the retention performance of three green roofs in London, Calgary, and Halifax. It was found that Calgary (67 %) has significantly better retention performance then both London (48 %) and Halifax (34 %). However, London retained the greatest volume of stormwater (758 mm), followed by Halifax (517 mm) then Calgary (474 mm). Further monitoring of the hydrologic response for a fourth green roof in London Ontario was conducted to identify and measure the fundamental processes of peak attenuation on a green roof. It was determined that field capacity is a quantifiable point, after which peak attenuation performance significantly decreases. Before field capacity peak attenuation is governed by capillary storage (72 %) and routing (7 %). After field capacity, <b>gravity</b> <b>storage</b> provides peak attenuation (22 %) and drainage routing plays a larger role (11 %). A predictive model was developed using Richards equation to simulate the outflow hydrographs of a green roof. Model results {{show that there is}} no significant difference from observed data for the performance metrics (ie., water storage, drainage, and peak flow rate). For the first time in green roof literature the impact of climate on retention was assessed, the processes of peak attenuation were quantified, and an accurate predictive model was presented...|$|E

Up to 50 wt% of the fat content in chocolate, that is cocoa butter and milk fats, is replaced with fruit juice {{in the form of}} emulsion droplets using a quiescent Pickering emulsion fabrication strategy. Fumed silica particles are used in combination with chitosan under acidic conditions (pH 3. 2 - 3. 8) to prepare water-in-oil emulsions, the oil phase being sunflower oil, molten cocoa butter, and ultimately white, milk, and dark chocolate. Adsorption of the polycationic chitosan molecules onto the surface of the silica particles influenced the particle wettability making it an effective Pickering stabilizer, as shown by cryogenic scanning electron microscopy analysis. The formation of a colloidal gel in the continuous (molten) oil phase provided the system with a yield stress, hereby giving it a gel-like and thus quiescent behaviour under low shear conditions, as determined by rheological measurements. This warrants a homogeneous distribution of emulsion droplets as settling through <b>gravity</b> upon <b>storage</b> under molten/liquid conditions is arrested.

5000|$|The South Essex Waterworks Company {{was formed}} in 1861, and {{supplied}} drinking water to an area of 103 sq mi stretching from Grays to East Ham and from Brentwood to the River Thames. Water was obtained from boreholes sunk into the chalk aquifer underlying the area, {{but by the time}} of the First World War, these supplies were not sufficient to meet the demand for water, and so the company looked further afield. Following the failure of the joint scheme with Southend Waterworks Company, they obtained an Act of Parliament in 1928 for a revised scheme which included a water treatment works at Langham with an intake from the River Stour. Treated water was pumped from the works to Tiptree works, and was pumped from there to a reservoir at Danbury. It then flowed by <b>gravity</b> to another <b>storage</b> reservoir at Herongate and then into the distribution network.

40|$|Lowering {{uncertainty}} in crude oil volume measurement {{has been widely}} considered as one of main purposes in an oil export terminal. It is found that crude oil temperature at metering station has big effects on measured volume and may cause big uncertainty at the metering point. As crude oil flows through an aboveground pipeline, pick up the solar radiation and heat up. This causes the oil temperature at the metering point to rise and higher uncertainty to be created. The amount of temperature rise is depended on exterior surface paint color. In the Kharg Island, there is about 3 km distance between the oil storage tanks and the metering point. The oil flows through the pipeline due to <b>gravity</b> effects as <b>storage</b> tanks are located 60 m higher than the metering point.

40|$|TAG LITHOIn {{this study}} we attempt to {{understand}} the water storage variations in a karst aquifer on the Larzac Plateau (South of France) using absolute gravimetry. On this karst system, water input is exclusively rainfall and draining occurs at the Durzon perennial spring in a karstic valley. Our basis assumption is that water storage in the vadose zone (epikarst and infiltration zone) has {{a significant effect on}} surface gravity through Newtonian attraction. The karst aquifer is hence being monitored since January 2006 with monthly absolute gravity measurements at three sites. The gravity measurements are corrected for regional scale <b>gravity</b> using water <b>storage</b> models in order to obtain gravity variations related exclusively to the local water <b>storage</b> variations. The <b>gravity</b> variations exhibit an important seasonal component (10 - 15 mu gal corresponding to a variation of equivalent water stab thickness of similar to 24 - 36 cm). Water storage variation seen by gravimetry is not spatially uniform on the studied karst system, corroborating current geomorphologic observations and interpretations. Finally, we use a global mass balance consideration linking rainfall, evapotranspiration and spring discharge to provide a conceptual framework for the understanding of observed gravity variations...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Msc Food Sc (Food Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The {{relationship}} between the “glassiness” defect in frozen French fries and the moisture, starch and reducing sugar content of the affected potato tuber was investigated. The effect of soil water quality, cultivar, soil depth, <b>storage</b> duration, specific <b>gravity</b> and blanching conditions during French fry production on the occurrence of “glassiness” was determined. Fourier transform near infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy was used to identify possible classifications of defected tubers. No significant difference occurred between the moisture (p= 0. 10, trial 1 and p= 0. 15, trial 2), starch (p= 0. 76, trial 1 and p= 0. 70, trial 2) or reducing sugar (p= 0. 05, trial 1 and p= 0. 51, trial 2) content of potato sample with and without the “glassiness” defect. Samples of the cultivar Herta (Her) showed the lowest occurrence of the defect (23 %, trial 1 and 0 %, trial 2), while the cultivar Columbus (Col) showed the highest occurrence (70 %, trial 1 and 84 %, trial 2). The soil water quality prevailing {{in the area of}} cultivation contributed to the amount of “glassiness” occurring in the samples of the cultivar Col. Col obtained from the Parys area (electrical capacity (EC) = 145 mS. m- 1) showed a 21 % occurrence of “glassiness”. Col obtained from the Uitvlug (EC = 57 mS. m- 1) and Zandrug (EC = 25 mS. m- 1) areas showed a 91 % occurrence of the defect. All samples cultivated in the Parys area during trial 1 showed a significantly lower occurrence of “glassiness” (p= 0. 01) than samples obtained from the areas Uitvlug and Zandrug. During trial 2 all samples obtained from the Thaaibos area (EC = 82 mS. m- 1) showed a lower occurrence of the defect than samples obtained from the area Witklip (EC = 178 mS. m- 1) although this difference was not statistically significant (p= 0. 06). Soil depth, specific <b>gravity</b> and <b>storage</b> duration did not contribute to {{a significant difference in the}} occurrence of “glassiness” between samples. Modified blanching conditions of 62 ºC for 25 min instead of 80 ºC for 20 min during frozen French fry processing had a reducing effect on the occurrence of the defect in the cultivars Fianna (Fia) (p= 0. 06), Pentland Dell (Pen) (p= 0. 05) and Col (p< 0. 01). The modified blanching conditions improved the texture uniformity in the French fry strip, reducing oil absorption during frying and prevented fry strips from breaking during subsequent processing steps. FT-NIR calibration models could not be successfully developed for the prediction of the moisture, starch and reducing sugar content in a potato sample. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated no classification between potato samples affected by the “glassiness” defect and samples without the defect. The calibration models for moisture, starch and reducing sugar content yielded a standard error of prediction (SEP) of 1. 62 %, 2. 28 % and 0. 07 %, respectively. The respective correlation coefficients of these calibration models were 0. 46, 0. 42 and 0. 41. The “glassiness” defect was most prominent in the cultivar Col. The occurrence of the defect was reduced and French fry quality improved by adjusting blanching parameters to 25 min at 62 ºC. FT-NIR spectroscopy is not recommended for screening of potato quality prior to processing...|$|R
40|$|Future human {{exploration}} {{of the solar system}} is likely to include establishing permanent outposts {{on the surface of the}} Moon. These outposts will require reliable sources of electrical power in the range of 10 's to 100 's of kWe to support exploration and resource utilization activities. This need is best met using nuclear reactor power systems which can operate steadily throughout the long ~ 27. 3 day lunar rotational period, irrespective of location. Nuclear power systems can potentially open up the entire lunar surface for future exploration and development. Desirable features of nuclear power systems for the lunar surface include passive operation, the avoidance of single point failures in reactor cooling and the integrated power system, moderate operating temperatures to enable the use of conventional materials with proven irradiation experience, utilization of the lunar regolith for radiation shielding and as a supplemental neutron reflector, and safe post-operation decay heat removal and storage for potential retrieval. In addition, it is desirable for the reactor to have a long operational life. Only a limited number of space nuclear reactor concepts have previously been developed for the lunar environment, and these designs possess only a few of these desirable design and operation features. The objective of this research is therefore to perform design and analyses of long operational life lunar reactors and power systems which incorporate the desirable features listed above. A long reactor operational life could be achieved either by increasing the amount of highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel in the core or by improving the neutron economy in the reactor through reducing neutron leakage and parasitic absorption. The amount of fuel in surface power reactors is constrained by the launch safety requirements. These include ensuring that the bare reactor core remains safely subcritical when submerged in water or wet sand and flooded with seawater in the unlikely event of a launch abort accident. Increasing the amount of fuel in the reactor core, and hence its operational life, would be possible by launching the reactor unfueled and fueling it on the Moon. Such a reactor would, thus, not be subject to launch criticality safety requirements. However, loading the reactor with fuel on the Moon presents a challenge, requiring special designs of the core and the fuel elements, which lend themselves to fueling on the lunar surface. This research investigates examples of both a solid core reactor that would be fueled at launch as well as an advanced concept which could be fueled on the Moon. Increasing the operational life of a reactor fueled at launch is exercised for the NaK- 78 cooled Sectored Compact Reactor (SCoRe). A multi-physics design and analyses methodology is developed which iteratively couples together detailed Monte Carlo neutronics simulations with 3 -D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and thermal-hydraulics analyses. Using this methodology the operational life of this compact, fast spectrum reactor is increased by reconfiguring the core geometry to reduce neutron leakage and parasitic absorption, for the same amount of HEU in the core, and meeting launch safety requirements. The multi-physics analyses determine the impacts of the various design changes on the reactor’s neutronics and thermal-hydraulics performance. The option of increasing the operational life of a reactor by loading it on the Moon is exercised for the Pellet Bed Reactor (PeBR). The PeBR uses spherical fuel pellets and is cooled by He-Xe gas, allowing the reactor core to be loaded with fuel pellets and charged with working fluid on the lunar surface. The performed neutronics analyses ensure the PeBR design achieves a long operational life, and develops safe launch canister designs to transport the spherical fuel pellets to the lunar surface. The research also investigates loading the PeBR core with fuel pellets on the Moon using a transient Discrete Element Method (DEM) analysis in lunar gravity. In addition, this research addresses the post-operation storage of the SCoRe and PeBR concepts, below the lunar surface, to determine the time required for the radioactivity in the used fuel to decrease to a low level to allow for its safe recovery. The SCoRe and PeBR concepts are designed to operate at coolant temperatures ≤ 900 K and use conventional stainless steels and superalloys for the structure in the reactor core and power system. They are emplaced below grade on the Moon to take advantage of the regolith as a supplemental neutron reflector and as shielding of the lunar outpost from the reactors’ neutron and gamma radiation. The SCoRe and PeBR concepts are designed with cores divided into six and three sectors, respectively. The sectors are thermally and neutronically coupled but hydraulically decoupled. Each sector is served by a separate cooling loop(s), with independent energy conversion and heat rejection radiator panels. This combination of a sectored core and power system integration with multiple loops avoids single point failures in reactor cooling, energy conversion, and heat rejection. These unique attributes would allow the reactor power system to continue operation, but at lower power, in the event one of the sectors experiences a Loss of Coolant (LOC) or a Loss of Cooling (LOCo). The power system could thus maintain a vital supply of electrical power to the lunar outpost for crew life support. The performed multi-physics design and performance analyses of the SCoRe show that increasing the diameter of the UN fuel rods increases the core excess reactivity. The larger diameter rods, however, increase the NaK- 78 coolant flow bypass near the walls of the core sectors. Scalloping the dividing walls of the core sectors produces a more even flow distribution. The use of 151 Eu spectral neutron poison additive to the UN fuel ensures subcriticality during a water submersion accident, for the compact SCoRe core, with the highest excess reactivity and lowest mass. The redesigned Solid-Core Sectored Compact Reactor (SC-SCoRe) with a monolithic solid core of Oxide Dispersion Strengthened Molybdenum (ODS-Mo) achieves a long operational life of 21 years at a nominal power of 1, 000 kWth. The high thermal conductivity ODS-Mo core structure allows the reactor to continue safe operation in the event that one of the core sectors experiences a LOC of LOCo. The ODS-Mo solid core readily conducts heat generated in that sector to the adjacent core sectors, to be removed by the flowing liquid metal coolant. The SCoRe power system with SiGe energy conversion is fully passive and load following. In addition, the decay heat is removed safely and passively following shutdown of the reactor at end of life. Neutronics and analyses show that the PeBR can achieve a very operational life of 66 years at a nominal thermal power of 471 kWth by fueling the reactor core on the Moon. This full power operational life is beyond what is possible with a reactor fueled at launch like the SC-SCoRe. Neutronics safety analysis of the fuel pellets transport canisters for the PeBR shows that they are made highly subcritical in a water submersion accident. This is achieved using a combination of favorable geometry and neutron absorbers. The DEM fuel loading simulation of the PeBR on the lunar surface demonstrates that the PeBR core sectors can be successfully fueled in lunar <b>gravity.</b> Post-operation <b>storage</b> analyses of the SC-SCoRe and PeBR concepts show that the radioactivity in the fuel decays away to a sufficiently low level within 300 years. The radiation field around the post-operational reactor at that time is low enough to allow humans to safely handle and retrieve the cores, for potential recovery of the valuable quantities of 235 U remaining in the fuel.
