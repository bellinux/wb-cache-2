30|$|In our {{previous}} study, {{we developed a}} gas sensor based on pure NiO films for sensing NH 3, which owned excellent stability and outstanding sensitivity performance [27]. However, as being a product, the major issue is that the recovery speed is very poor at room temperature because the desorptions of gas molecules adsorbed on sensor need take a long time, and similar problem was proposed via other investigators [28 – 30]. To solve this problem, we would fabricate the nickel oxide two-dimensional grainy films and <b>doping</b> <b>zinc</b> ions forming in micro region, which enhanced the response and recovery speeds via improving electron transport and gas molecular diffusion in this special nanostructure. In the present work, we present a hydrothermal controllable route combined with high-temperature oxidation approach to prepare Zn-doped NiO films with well-controlled morphologies and systematically investigate Zn-doping effects on the gas-sensing performance of sensors at room temperature. The {{results showed that the}} response and recovery speed of NH 3 can be remarkably improved via <b>doping</b> <b>zinc</b> ions in nanoscale NiO films as compared with pristine NiO films, which may provide a simple approach to fabricate excellent gas sensors based on metal oxides with desirable gas-sensing performance.|$|R

ZnO has several characteristics that allow it to be used in several novel devices such as development of light-emitting assemblies and solar cells. However, because ZnO is of slightly lower conductivity than metal and indium tin oxide (ITO), it can be doped and hybridized with metal NPs like platinum to improve its conductivity. A method to do so would be to synthesize ZnO NPs using methanol reduction and incorporate at 0.25 at.% platinum NPs. This boosts the electrical properties of ZnO films while preserving its transmittance for application in transparent conducting oxides.|$|R

5000|$|Many new {{solar cells}} use {{transparent}} thin films {{that are also}} conductors of electrical charge. The dominant conductive thin films used in research now are transparent conductive oxides (abbreviated [...] "TCO"), and include fluorine-doped tin oxide (SnO2:F, or [...] "FTO"), <b>doped</b> <b>zinc</b> oxide (e.g.: ZnO:Al), and indium tin oxide (abbreviated [...] "ITO"). These conductive films are also used in the LCD industry for flat panel displays. The dual function of a TCO allows light to pass through a substrate window to the active light-absorbing material beneath, and also serves as an ohmic contact to transport photogenerated charge carriers away from that light-absorbing material. The present TCO materials are effective for research, but perhaps are not yet optimized for large-scale photovoltaic production. They require very special deposition conditions at high vacuum, they can sometimes suffer from poor mechanical strength, and most have poor transmittance in the infrared portion of the spectrum (e.g.: ITO thin films {{can also be used}} as infrared filters in airplane windows). These factors make large-scale manufacturing more costly.|$|E
50|$|Transparent {{conductive}} coatings {{are used}} in applications where {{it is important that}} the coating conduct electricity or dissipate static charge. Conductive coatings are used to protect the aperture from electromagnetic Interference, while dissipative coatings are used to prevent the build-up of static electricity. Transparent conductive coatings are also used extensively to provide electrodes in situations where light is required to pass, for example in flat panel display technologies and in many photoelectrochemical experiments. A common substance used in transparent conductive coatings is indium tin oxide (ITO). ITO is not very optically transparent, however. The layers must be thin to provide substantial transparency, particularly at the blue end of the spectrum. Using ITO, sheet resistances of 20 to 10,000 ohms per square can be achieved. An ITO coating may be combined with an antireflective coating to further improve transmittance. Other TCOs (Transparent Conductive Oxides) include AZO (Aluminium <b>doped</b> <b>Zinc</b> Oxide), which offers much better UV transmission than ITO.A special class of transparent conductive coatings applies to infrared films for theater-air military optics where IR transparent windows need to have (Radar) stealth (Stealth technology) properties. These are known as RAITs (Radar Attenuating / Infrared Transmitting) and include materials such as boron doped DLC (Diamond-like carbon).|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{transform}} energy from electromagnetic radiation into oscillations of free electrons {{at the surface}} of certain materials forms the basis of surface plasmonics. The majority of {{research in this area}} has utilized noble metals such as gold and silver owing to their appropriate optical response and low loss at visible frequencies. However, these materials are not suited for many applications operating out of the visible spectrum and at high temperatures. Therefore many researchers are investigating new plasmonic materials. At the forefront of this search is aluminum-doped zinc oxide. By adjusting the free electron concentration, this high melting point material can be tuned to operate throughout the infrared spectrum up to the important telecommunication wavelength (ca. 1550 nm) with lower loss than any other material studied. However, to date, high quality aluminum-doped zinc oxide capable of operating at telecommunications wavelengths has only been demonstrated with the non-scalable and non-conformal method of pulsed laser deposition. Herein, a simple process is devised that enables the use of atomic layer deposition, an ultraconformal, highly scalable technique, to synthesize tunable aluminum <b>doped</b> <b>zinc</b> oxide thin films with plasmonic properties that rival the best films achieved by pulsed laser deposition.
