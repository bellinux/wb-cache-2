25|$|Davidson {{argued that}} {{anomalous}} monism follows from three plausible theses. Firstly, he assumes {{the denial of}} epiphenomenalism, the denial of the view that mental events do not cause physical events. Secondly, he assumes a nomological view of causation, according to which one event causes another if (and only if) there is a strict, exceptionless law governing {{the relation between the}} events. Thirdly, he assumes the principle of the anomalism of the mental, according to which there are no strict laws that govern the relationship between mental <b>event</b> <b>types</b> and physical <b>event</b> <b>types.</b> By these the theses, Davidson argued, it follows that the causal relations between the mental and the physical hold only between mental event tokens, but mental events as types are anomalous. That ultimately secures token physicalism and a supervenience relation between the mental and the physical, while respecting the autonomy of the mental (Malpas, 2005, §2).|$|E

25|$|Grid Autosport emphasises {{the concept}} of racing disciplines, making them into the new event categories. There are five main categories: Touring, Endurance, Open Wheel, Tuner, and Street. During Career mode, the player picks a {{particular}} event {{in one of these}} categories, with each event (a string of races) making up a season. Each discipline features markedly different cars and race types. The latter include standard Races, Endurance races with tire wear enabled, Time Attack events, Drift events, and - as downloadable content (DLC) - Time Trials, Drag and point-to-point Sprint races. These are all accessible in Custom Cup mode as well, in which the player can also choose to participate in certain special <b>event</b> <b>types,</b> such as Checkpoint, Eliminator and Demolition Derby.|$|E
40|$|Automatic {{organization}} of personal photos {{is a problem}} with many real world ap- plications, and can be divided into two main tasks: recognizing the <b>event</b> <b>type</b> of the photo collection, and selecting interesting images from the collection. In this paper, we attempt to simultaneously solve both tasks: album-wise event recognition and image- wise importance prediction. We collected an album dataset with both <b>event</b> <b>type</b> labels and image importance labels, refined from an existing CUFED dataset. We propose a hybrid system consisting of three parts: A siamese network-based event-specific image importance prediction, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that recognizes the <b>event</b> <b>type,</b> and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) -based sequence level event recognizer. We propose an iterative updating procedure for <b>event</b> <b>type</b> and image importance score prediction. We experimentally verified that image importance score prediction and <b>event</b> <b>type</b> recognition can each help the performance of the other. Comment: Accepted as oral in BMVC 201...|$|R

25|$|Constructed {{during the}} 2003 {{redevelopment}} {{on the site}} of the Ghost Train, the Big Top (originally to be named the Luna Circus) is a fully licensed, multi-purpose venue capable of seating 2,000 people (this capacity can increase to 3,000 for standing-only concerts). The modular design of the stage and seating allows the entire venue to be easily reconfigured for different <b>event</b> <b>types,</b> and the concrete building is heavily soundproofed to cut down on noise pollution. Examples of events run in the Big Top include concerts (including shows from Kylie Minogue's Anti Tour and the annual Come Together Music Festival), award shows and presentations (like the inaugural MTV Australia Video Music Awards or the live finals for the 2005-2008 seasons of Australia's Next Top Model), sporting tournaments (like the Australia Mixed Martial Arts Cage Fighting Championship and the 2013 Sydney Darts Masters), trade shows, and other large events.|$|E
2500|$|Mike Rose, {{reviewer}} for Strategy Informer, lauded the split-screen multiplayer, but {{noted that}} the online play needed adjustment.

2500|$|In [...] "Mental Events" [...] (1970) Davidson {{advanced}} {{a form of}} token identity {{theory about}} the mind: token mental events are identical to token physical events. One previous difficulty with such a view was {{that it did not}} seem feasible to provide laws relating mental states, like believing that the sky is blue or wanting a hamburger, to physical states, such as patterns of neural activity in the brain. [...] Davidson argued that such a reduction would not be necessary to a token identity thesis: it is possible that each individual mental event just is the corresponding physical event, without there being laws relating types (as opposed to tokens) of mental events to types of physical events. Davidson argued that the fact that no such a reduction could be had does not entail that the mind is anything more than the brain. Hence, Davidson called his position anomalous monism: monism, because it claims that only one thing is at issue in questions of mental and physical events; anomalous (from a-, [...] "not," [...] and omalos, [...] "regular") because mental and physical <b>event</b> <b>types</b> could not be connected by strict laws (laws without exceptions).|$|E

However, she criticized the amount of space the graphics take up, writing that [...] "it wastes {{a lot of space}} {{that could be used to}} show more events at a glance. It's not a huge peeve, but for anyone who has a busy calendar, it could result in a lot of scrolling". She also criticized the Smart Suggestions, writing that [...] "in my short time using Google Calendar, the natural language support leaves a lot to be desired. I had trouble typing times or days and getting Google to understand it". She did, however, like the view options available, writing that [...] "The three day view is one of my favorites", but also noted that there was a lack of [...] "the ability to quickly drag events around to reschedule them". Kazmucha also criticized the then-lack of a widget in the Notification Center, but wrote conclusively that [...] "Google Calendar is off to a good start but it isn't making me switch away from [...]" ...|$|E
