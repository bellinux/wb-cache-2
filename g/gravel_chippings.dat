40|$|Infrastructural {{changes were}} {{implemented}} on rural 80 km/h roads in The Netherlands {{in an effort}} to reduce speeding. The road infrastructure changes were designed to produce discomfort for the speeding driver by providing noxious auditory and haptic feedback. On experimental roads, smooth-surface road width was reduced by using blocks of <b>gravel</b> <b>chippings</b> placed along the centre line and at intervals on road edges. It was predicted that these changes would increase mental load while driving, and thereby decrease speeding. In a field experiment 28 subjects drove an instrumented vehicle over experimental and control roads. A decrease in driving speed and swerving behaviour was found on the experimental roads, and this was coupled with a decrease in heart rate variability, consistent with an increase in mental load. Roads in two different road-side environments (woodland vs. moorland) were also tested. There were differences in driver appraisal of the two environments, but no interactions were observed between these appraisals and driving performance on the experimental roads. It is concluded that the infrastructural measures have a useful role to play in road safety through a reduction in driver speeding...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide, {{concrete}} {{is second}} only to water in terms of its quantities used, with around 10 billion tons of concrete required each year. More than 900 million tons of old concrete from demolition or renovation are generated per year in Europe, the US and Japan. To date, no commercially viable process has been developed to effectively recycle old concrete to generate new input materials for cement and concrete production. This problem arises from the fact that concrete is a composite material comprising the aggregate, such as <b>gravel</b> or limestone <b>chippings,</b> and a binder matrix (the cement paste). Mechanical processing equipment such as an impact mill or jaw crusher merely succeeds in milling the old concrete, but does not disintegrate it to separate its constituents. The so-called electro dynamic fragmentation process is an innovative method to selectively separate composite materials. In this process, solids are separated along their particle boundaries {{as a result of a}} transient electric discharge...|$|R
