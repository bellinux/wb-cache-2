5|$|Development of {{the game}} began after Uchikoshi joined Chunsoft to write a visual novel for them that could reach a wider audience; Uchikoshi {{suggested}} adding puzzle elements that are integrated with the game's story. The inspiration for the story was {{the question of where}} inspiration comes from; while researching it, Uchikoshi came across Rupert Sheldrake's morphic resonance hypothesis, which became the main theme {{of the game}}. The music was composed by Shinji Hosoe, while the characters were designed by Kinu Nishimura. The localization was handled by Aksys Games; they worked by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese version, opting for natural-sounding English rather than following the original's <b>exact</b> <b>wording.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{was done}} by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese, making dialogue sound like what a native speaker of English would say instead of strictly adhering the original's <b>exact</b> <b>wording.</b> The localization editor, Ben Bateman, did this by looking at the writing from a wider view, line by line or scene by scene rather than word by word or sentence by sentence, and thinking about how to convey the same ideas in English. Most parts of the game that include a joke in the localization also have a joke in the Japanese version, but a different one; Bateman did however try to make similar types of jokes, with similar contents and ideas. The game's use of Japanese language puns led to problems, as many of them relied on Japanese dialects to function; for these, Bateman replaced them with new puns in English. He was given mostly free rein in what he could change or add, as long as it did not disrupt the plot.|$|E
25|$|Wilberforce had a {{track record}} against {{evolution}} {{as far back as}} the previous Oxford B.A. meeting in 1847 when he attacked Chambers' Vestiges. For the more challenging task of opposing the Origin, and the implication that man descended from apes, he had been assiduously coached by Richard Owen– Owen stayed with him the night before the debate. On the day Wilberforce repeated some of the arguments from his Quarterly Review article (written but not yet published), then ventured onto slippery ground. His famous jibe at Huxley (as to whether Huxley was descended from an ape on his mother's side or his father's side) was probably unplanned, and certainly unwise. Huxley's reply to the effect that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his great talents to suppress debate—the <b>exact</b> <b>wording</b> is not certain—was widely recounted in pamphlets and a spoof play.|$|E

25|$|Between 5 and 6 a.m. on April 6, 1862, Grant's army at Pittsburg Landing was {{surprised}} and nearly routed by a sudden attack from the Confederate army under Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston. Grant, who heard the early morning artillery fire, took a steamboat from his headquarters at Savannah, Tennessee, to Crump's Landing, where he gave Wallace orders to wait in reserve {{and be ready to}} move. Grant proceeded to Pittsburg Landing, where he arrived around 8:30a.m. Grant's new orders to Wallace, which arrived between 11 and 11:30a.m., were given verbally to an aide, who transcribed them before they were delivered. The written orders were lost during the battle, so their <b>exact</b> <b>wording</b> cannot be confirmed; however, eyewitness accounts agree that Grant ordered Wallace to join {{the right side of the}} Union army, presumably in support of Brig. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's 5th Division, who were encamped near Shiloh Church on the morning of April 6.|$|E
500|$|The {{note was}} printed in neat, all-capital letters with a {{felt-tip}} pen. Its <b>exact</b> <b>wording</b> is unknown, because Cooper later reclaimed it, but Schaffner recalled that it indicated {{he had a}} bomb in his briefcase, and directed her to sit beside him. Schaffner did as requested, then quietly asked to see the bomb. Cooper cracked open his briefcase long {{enough for her to}} glimpse eight red cylinders ("four on top of four") attached to wires coated with red insulation, and a large cylindrical battery. After closing the briefcase, he dictated his demands: $200,000 in [...] "negotiable American currency"; four parachutes (two primary and two reserve); and a fuel truck standing by in Seattle to refuel the aircraft upon arrival. Schaffner conveyed Cooper's instructions to the pilots in the cockpit: when she returned, he was wearing dark sunglasses.|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{display the}} entire board, only two full spaces (and {{a section of}} a third) are {{displayed}} at one time during gameplay. The board scrolls {{from right to left}} as the player advances following each dice roll, while pressing the [...] "X" [...] key takes the player to a separate screen showing a full list of sites and their current ownership, allowing players to buy and sell properties between themselves, to build houses and hotels, and to mortgage and unmortgage properties. On landing on a property the player is offered the chance to buy it; if the player declines, or they have insufficient funds, the property is put up for auction. The game copies the UK version of the Monopoly board game in every significant detail, including the <b>exact</b> <b>wording</b> of the property names and [...] "chance" [...] cards.|$|E

500|$|The act must be {{inherently}} criminal [...] {{the case}} in point is that of R v Andrews, where the defendant had killed whilst driving dangerously. It was only the fact that the driving was dangerous that made it a crime, not the driving itself. Accordingly, Andrews removed driving and regulatory offences from the scope of constructive manslaughter. There are separate rules for causing death by dangerous driving and some regulatory offences. Some commentators took Andrews as excluding strict liability and negligence cases out of constructive manslaughter, although contrary to the <b>exact</b> <b>wording</b> in the judgment there; however, a separate case also called R v Andrews convicted the defendant of constructive manslaughter based on a strict liability offence and this alternative proposition cannot be supported. Gross negligence manslaughter exists as a complementary form, and, if a driver was sufficiently negligent, as well he might, he would be liable for it. This provides an additional reason to exclude such cases from constructive manslaughter.|$|E
500|$|On May 14, 1995, a {{referendum}} {{was conducted in}} all regions of Belarus. Out of four questions, one was the following: [...] "Do you support {{the introduction of the}} new national symbols?" [...] With a voter turnout of 64.7%, the new state symbols were approved by a ratio of 3:1 (75.1% to 24.9%). The way the referendum was carried out was heavily criticized by the opposition, including the <b>exact</b> <b>wording</b> of the question about the national insignia. Supporters of the Pahonia also criticize that the Pahonia and the former white-red-white flag were compared to ones, used by collaboration forces, in propaganda that was published during the run-up to the vote. The comparison was made due to the white, red, white flag and Pahonia being used on the patches and symbols of the Belarusian Central Rada, the Belarusian government under the control of Nazi Germany. Alexander Lukashenko claimed the selection of the Soviet-inspired symbols as a victory, especially to his Great Patriotic War veteran base, by saying [...] "we have returned to you the flag of the country for which you fought. We have returned to you both memory and a sense of human pride." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the Minimum <b>Exact</b> <b>Word</b> Error (exactMWE) {{training}} criterion to optimise {{the parameters of}} large scale speech recognition systems. The exactMWE criterion {{is similar to the}} Minimum Word Error (MWE) criterion but uses the <b>exact</b> <b>word</b> error instead of an approximation based on time alignments as used in the MWE criterion. It is shown that the <b>exact</b> <b>word</b> error for all word sequence hypotheses can be represented on a word lattice. This can be accomplished using transducer-based methods. The result is a word lattice of slightly refined topology. The accumulated weights of each path through such a lattice then represent the <b>exact</b> number of <b>word</b> errors for the corresponding word sequence hypothesis. Using this compressed representation of the word error of all word sequences represented in the original lattice, exactMWE can be performed using the same latticebased re-estimation process as for MWE training. First experiments on the Wall Street Journal dictation task do not show significant differences in recognition performance between exactMWE and MWE at comparable computational complexity and convergence behaviour of the training. 1...|$|R
