25|$|Dewey {{believed}} that a woman’s place in society was determined by her environment and not <b>just</b> <b>her</b> biology. On women he says, “You think too much of women in terms of sex. Think of them as human individuals for a while, dropping out the sex qualification, and you won’t be so sure of some of your generalizations about what they should and shouldn’t do”. John Dewey’s support helped to increase the support and popularity of Jane Addams’ Hull House and other settlement houses as well. With growing support, involvement of the community grew {{as well as the}} support for the women’s suffrage movement.|$|E

A month later, Williams won her first {{professional}} singles title when she defeated Amélie Mauresmo in the final of the Open Gaz de France in Paris. With Venus also winning the IGA Superthrift Classic in Memphis, Tennessee that day, the pair became the first sisters to win professional tournaments in the same week. In March of that year, at the Evert Cup in California, Williams won her first Tier I title, defeating Steffi Graf in the final. Soon afterwards at the Lipton International Players Championships, Williams had her 16-match winning streak ended by her sister in the first all-sister singles final in WTA history, and she then made her top-10 debut, at world number nine.

Reitzel on 16December 1835 in Copenhagen, Denmark, with [...] "The Naughty Boy" [...] and [...] "The Traveling Companion" [...] {{in the second}} installment of Fairy Tales Told for Children. [...] "Thumbelina" [...] is about a tiny girl and her adventures with appearance- and marriage-minded toads, moles, and cockchafers. She successfully avoids their intentions before {{falling in love with}} a flower-fairy prince <b>just</b> <b>her</b> size.|$|E
500|$|Her {{biculturalism}} and bilingualism {{are also}} very important aspects of her writing. Cisneros was quoted by Robin Ganz as saying that she is grateful to have [...] "twice as many words to pick from...two {{ways of looking at}} the world," [...] and Ganz referred to her [...] "wide range of experience" [...] as a [...] "double-edged sword." [...] Cisneros's ability to speak two languages and to write about her two cultures gives her a unique position from where she is able to tell not <b>just</b> <b>her</b> story, but also the stories of those around her.|$|E

500|$|The Baltimore Sun critic, Mary Carole McCauley, {{noted that}} the book was more serious than the {{previous}} novels in the series and had more straightforward prose. Furthermore, reviewer Alice Fordham from The Times wrote that [...] "Rowling's genius is not <b>just</b> <b>her</b> total realisation of a fantasy world, but the quieter skill of creating characters that bounce off the page, real and flawed and brave and lovable". Fordham concluded, [...] "We have been a long way together, and neither Rowling nor Harry let us down in the end". The New York Times writer Michiko Kakutani agreed, praising Rowling's ability to make Harry both a hero and a character that can be related to.|$|E

[...] "I think she enjoys not being completely approachable. <b>Just</b> <b>her</b> office is very intimidating. You have to walk about a mile into the office before you get to her desk and I'm sure it's intentional," [...] Coddington says. [...] "I don't find her to be accessible to people she doesn't need to be accessible to," [...] agrees Vogue publisher Tom Florio.|$|E
500|$|However Lloyd Webber {{was still}} wary about Madonna's singing, so after {{securing}} the role, she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader. Since Evita required the actors to sing their own parts, the training helped in increasing Madonna's {{confidence in the}} songs. Lader noted that the singer [...] "had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. Evita is real musical theater— its operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't know she had." [...] She taught Madonna how to sing using her diaphragm rather than <b>just</b> <b>her</b> throat, enabling her to project her voice in a more cohesive manner. Madonna was thrilled to find the newly discovered nuances in her voice and would go home every night, practicing by telephoning her friends and singing to them.|$|E
