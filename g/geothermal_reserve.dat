40|$|AbstractSaudi Arabia is {{enriched by}} many {{geothermal}} {{resources that are}} located along the western coastal part of the Red Sea, {{in the form of}} a number of hot springs and many volcanic eruptions. Wadi Al-Lith is considered one of the most promising geothermal targets that encounter many hot springs with a good surface temperature upto 95 °C. This paper aims mainly to evaluate the geothermal potential of the main hot spring at Wadi Al-Lith area (Ain Al Harrah). The available remote sensing images are analyzed and a number of 2 D electric resistivity profiles are interpreted to delineate the surface geological lineaments and the subsurface structural elements that control the movement of the thermal water. It is found that the main surface lineaments are structurally oriented along NNE–SSW and NE–SW directions with a frequency percentage of 52 % and an average lineament length of 835 m. Furthermore the subsurface structural elements, as inferred from the interpretation of the geophysical 2 D electric profiles, have assumed the same directions beside the NW–SE direction. The characteristics of thermal water of the hot spring are indicated through analyzing the major and minor elements of some collected water samples. Geo-thermometers are applied to estimate, subsurface temperature, heat flow and discharge enthalpy. These parameters are found to be 136 °C, 183 mW/M 2 and 219 kJ/kg, respectively. An estimate of the <b>geothermal</b> <b>reserve</b> using the volumetric method, gave total stored heat energy of 1. 713 × 1017 J (rock and fluid) and a <b>geothermal</b> <b>reserve</b> potential of 26. 99 MWt.

40|$|I {{would like}} to comment on the Briefing of 22 November (p. 1113) {{concerning}} the outlook for geothermal energy in California. The Briefing's somewhat gloomy outlook is due largely to a confusion of the geothermal resource estimates made by the U. S. Geolog-ical Survey (USGS) in 1979 (contrary to the assertion in the Briefing, the 1979 inventory is the most recent USGS inventory) with the <b>geothermal</b> <b>reserve</b> estimates made by Ebasco Services in 1991. By definition, re-serves represent only that fraction of the resource that can be exploited profitably with current technology. With an under-standing of this difference, one can see that there is no actual conflict between the 1979 USGS study and the 1991 Ebasco report. Although production at The Geysers has dropped significantly [to 1380 megawatts-electric (MWe) from the installed capacity of 2000 MWe], much of this drop can be attributed to overoptimism and overexploi-tation by the field developers. (The 1979 USGS study estimated a 1610 MWe capac-ity for The Geysers.) With new technologi-cal developments such as fluid injection, jointly researched by industry and govern-ment, {{it should be possible to}} recapture some of the lost generating capacity. California's geology (and that in neigh-boring states) still promises an abundance of economical, environmentally acceptable geo-thermal energy. Supporting studies for the National Energy Strategy indicate that un-der reasonable assumptions approximately 11, 000 MWe from hydrothermal resources can be on-line nationally by 2010, and 22, 000 MWe by 2030. In addition, more advanced geothermal resources (hot dry rock, geopressured geothermal systems, and magma) can potentially play a significant role in satisfying America's long-term ener-gy needs.

40|$|The author critiques the Exploration {{component}} of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Geothermal Program Review X. The comments focus principally on the hydrothermal portion of the DOE program, but he also makes some commentary on the Long Valley Exploratory Well and Geopressured-Geothermal components of the program, {{as well as some}} general comments. Before I do that, I would like to review the current state of geothermal exploration in the United States. According to Koenig (1989, 1990) who critiqued the DOE Geothermal Program in those years, geothermal exploration in the western U. S. has been conducted in virtually all of the apparent geothermal resource areas. Many of these areas which were under exploration in the 1960 s and 1970 s, and were explored in part under the U. S. DOE Industry Coupled Program have progressed to commercial status in the 80 s. The DOE March (1992) Draft Multi-Year Program Plan for FY 1993 - 1997 states that 8 out of the 14 geothermal resource areas explored under this Industry Coupled Program in the late 1970 s are currently under production. I do not think we will find anyone in this room, in the geothermal industry, or in the United States that will argue with the clear and outstanding success of that government program. When the prices of oil dropped in the 1980 s, many geothermal operators left the industry, and with the dramatic decrease in activity, many of the service companies went by the wayside also. By and large, the domestic geothermal industry today is emaciated. As a result of the capital intensive nature of geothermal development, the historical long lead times to go from exploration to production, the highly entrepreneurial nature of the industry, and the lack of an economic market, virtually no new exploration has been conducted in the U. S. in about 10 years. The consequence of this lack of activity is an almost nonexistent <b>geothermal</b> <b>reserve</b> base, outside of known producing fields and their immediate surrounds. The U.

40|$|We present two running {{applications}} of direct use of low temperature geothermal resources for {{heating and cooling}} of public buildings, recently realized in the Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG) Region - Northeastern Italy - with public fundings. The Grado Geothermal Pilot Project was an ambitious challenge, initiated in 2002 and completed in early 2015, aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and sustainability of a geothermal doublet on the Grado Island (GO), in the northern Adriatic coastal area, by: i) characterizing the geothermal carbonate reservoir of the Grado area, ii) estimating its heat potential, iii) drilling a geothermal doublet, with one production and one re - injection well. The project had a total cost of 5 million € and included two phases. The 1 st phase, completed in 2008, confirmed {{the existence of a}} low temperature geothermal reservoir within the buried carbonate platform, assessed its geothermal potential and verified the feasibility of the district heating plant in Grado. Seismic and gravity surveys were completed to locate the first exploratory well. Grado - 1 borehole was drilled down to 1110 m, into a terrigenous cover and a Paleogene - Mesozoic carbonate basement high. The 2 nd phase (2012 - 2015) included further geophysical prospecting to extend reservoir investigations and to locate the second borehole. Grado - 2 was drilled in 2014, at about one km distance to the East of Grado - 1, down to 1200 m. By December 2014, two km of district heating distribution network was deployed and the first two public buildings were connected. We focus here mainly on the geophysical and well data and on the pumping tests that were acquired before, during and after the drilling of the two wells. The data set allowed the characterization of the reservoir and the assessment of its geothermal potential. Some of the main results are: the identification of major fault systems and production areas, the comprehension of the hydraulic circulation systems, the assessment of the geochemical facies of waters and of their sustainable utilization. The Grado reservoir is a confined fractured aquifer hosting anoxic fossil seawaters with temperatures up to 49 °C in Grado - 2 (7 °C higher than Grado - 1), pressure of 250 kPa at wellhead and spontaneous artesian outflow of about 100 t/h. Pumping test results indicate a sustainable water production up to 140 t/h. The circulating system is a complex network of permeable vugs and highly trasmissive karst-fractured discontinuities, interested by several fault systems driven by Alpine and Dinaric deformation phases. Interference pumping tests proved the hydraulic connectivity between wells, but, due to the poor system recharge, the hydraulic sustainability of the geothermal doublet must be guaranteed by re - injection. The initial functioning of the district heating plant, envisaging a geothermal heating of several connected public buildings during cold seasons (up to about 3 MW(th) heating load), will allow a significant economical saving of the order of 80 000 – 100 000 €/yr. Nevertheless, the <b>geothermal</b> <b>reserve</b> affords to foster other relevant uses besides the district heating. Several future perspectives of development are suggested for Grado geothermal potential; 3 D thermo - fluid dynamic numerical modelling will optimize the system production and manage the sustainability of the geothermal plant. The existing cooling system of the ice rink of Pontebba town (UD), located close to the Austrian border, was totally renovated in late summer 2012 : a open loop heat pump system using groundwater thermal energy was realized and functions both for the ice production and maintenance, and for the heating and hot water needs of the ice stadium. Two ammonia heat pumps (350 kW each) were installed, supported by two production water wells (32 m deep) and one re - injection water well (30 m deep), drilled into the alluvial deposits of the Fella River. A total production rate of up to 200 t/h could be achieved from the shallow unconfined aquifer, with an average temperature of about 8. 5 - 9. 0 °C. Numerical modelling of groundwater flow supported the assessment of the production and re - injection rates, as well as the evaluation and the minimization of the impacts on the groundwater resource during the plant management in various hydraulic regimes.

Also for the Cooper Basin, he proposed the establishment of a fully sustainable city where, [...] "hundreds of thousands of people would live", utilising these <b>geothermal</b> energy <b>reserves.</b> He named the city, [...] "Geothermia". Subsequently, in 2007, an exploration company was established. The company expected to raise at least $11.5m on the Australian Stock Exchange. Flannery took up shares in the company. In 2010, the Federal Government provided the company with another $90m for the development work. In August 2016, the geothermal energy project closed as it was not financially viable.|$|R
40|$|Research Proposal to the Geothermal Division, Energy Research and Development Administration from University of HawaiiNow {{that high}} {{temperatures}} have been encountered in HGP-A, additional importance {{is placed on}} a comprehensive analysis of all of'the scientific data that has been accumulated by the Project {{over the last three}} years. Pertinent information from the USGS, State agencies, and other University projects must also be evaluated and related to actual subsurface conditions. This is an essential phase of this scientific endeavor, if maximum benefit is to be derived from the significant investment of public and private funds that have gone into this project. The analysis and synthesis of this information should provide valuable insight into the understanding of potential <b>geothermal</b> <b>reserves,</b> not only in Hawaii, but for basaltic volcanic geothermal regimes in the Western United States and throughout the world. The purpose of the funds requested in this proposal is to provide support with which to complete analysis and interpretation of the data and, through comparison with actual subsurface conditions, develop correlations on the reliability of the various methods of prediction. Monitoring activities associated with emission of mercury and other toxic elements will be continued. We also propose a limited number of field experiments designed to assist in the understanding of the reservoir dynamics. A synthesis of all pertinent data from geosciences, from mathematical modelling, from drilling, from well testing will contribute to a more complete understanding of the geothermal regime associated with this well. Progress has been initiated on the analysis of HGP-A, including preliminary well testing, during the three-month transition period with $ 104, 464 in ERDA support. The total budget requested for FY 77 to complete analysis of HGP-A is $ 336, 653, with $ 66, 405 of direct support [...] as well as the salaries for many of the researchers and administrative staff contributing to the project coming from the State of Hawaii. This raises the total of direct State support to the HGP above $ 775, 000. The report contains narrative summaries and complete budgets...|$|R
40|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} one of the cleanest sources of energy which is gaining {{importance}} as an alternative to hydrocarbons. <b>Geothermal</b> energy <b>reserves</b> in China are enormous and it has a huge potential for exploitation and utilization. However, the development of the geothermal industry in China lags far behind other renewable energy sources {{because of the lack of}} fiscal and taxation policy support. In this paper, we adopt the system dynamics method and use the causal loop diagram to explore the development mechanism of fiscal and taxation policies in the geothermal industry. The effect of the fiscal and taxation policy on the development of the geothermal industry is analyzed. In order to promote sustainable development of the geothermal industry in China, the government should pay more attention to subsidies for the geothermal industry in the life-cycle stage of the geothermal industry. Furthermore, a plan is necessary to provide a reasonable system of fiscal and taxation policies...|$|R
