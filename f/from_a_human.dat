5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, {{the ability to use}} a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>human,</b> another mammal, or a bird.|$|E

5|$|Don Murphy was {{planning}} a , {{but when the}} United States launched the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Hasbro suggested adapting the Transformers franchise instead. Tom DeSanto joined Murphy {{because he was a}} fan of the series. They met with comic book writer Simon Furman, and cited the Generation 1 cartoon and comics as their main influence. They made the Creation Matrix their plot device, though Murphy had it renamed because of the film series The Matrix. DeSanto chose to write the treatment <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> point of view to engage the audience, while Murphy wanted it to have a realistic tone, reminiscent of a disaster film. The treatment featured the Autobots Optimus Prime, Ironhide, Jazz, Prowl, Arcee, Ratchet, Wheeljack, and Bumblebee, and the Decepticons Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave, Ravage, Laserbeak, Rumble, Skywarp and Shockwave.|$|E
5|$|Mermaids {{from the}} Isle of Man, known as ben-varrey, are {{considered}} more favorable toward humans {{than those of}} other regions, with various accounts of assistance, gifts and rewards.

Another recounts {{the tale of a}} baby mermaid who stole a doll <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> little girl, but was rebuked by her mother and sent back to the girl with a gift of a pearl necklace to atone for the theft. A third story tells of a fishing family that made regular gifts of apples to a mermaid and was rewarded with prosperity.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{literature}} exploring bioethical questions <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> rights perspective {{has been}} criticised {{on the grounds}} that human rights theory contains unresolved problems. Bioethicists have claimed that bioethical inquiry can contribute to resolving these problems. Cochrane claims that this contribution to human rights literature offers three insights, but that these are not entirely original. These insights are questions about institutional fairness, rights as trumps and rights as solely belonging to humans. Cochrane holds that human rights should be reconceptualised as sentient rights. The grounding of human rights, he claims, are not distinct from the grounding of human obligations to nonhuman animals, and attempts to distinguish human rights from the rights of other sentient beings ultimately fail.|$|E

25|$|At 7:30a.m. the {{following}} morning, Cattran and Wheeler returned to 23 Cranley Gardens, {{by which time}} the drain had been cleared. This aroused the suspicions of both the drain inspector and his supervisor. Cattran discovered some scraps of flesh and four bones in a pipe leading from the drain which linked to the top flat of the house. To both Cattran and Wheeler, the bones {{looked as if they}} originated <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> hand. Both men immediately called the police who, upon closer inspection, discovered further small bones and scraps of what looked to the naked eye like either human or animal flesh in the same pipe leading from the drain. These remains were taken to the mortuary at Hornsey, where pathologist Professor David Bowen advised police that the remains were indeed human, and that one particular piece of flesh he concluded had been <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> neck bore a ligature mark.|$|E

25|$|An {{autopilot}} is a mechanical, electrical, or {{hydraulic system}} used to guide a vehicle without assistance <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> being. Most people understand an autopilot to refer specifically to aircraft, but self-steering gear for ships, boats, space craft, and missiles is sometimes also called autopilot.

25|$|In 1889, C. tetani was {{isolated}} <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> victim, by Kitasato Shibasaburō, who later {{showed that the}} organism could produce disease when injected into animals, and that the toxin could be neutralized by specific antibodies. In 1897, Edmond Nocard showed that tetanus antitoxin induced passive immunity in humans, and {{could be used for}} prophylaxis and treatment. Tetanus toxoid vaccine was developed by P. Descombey in 1924, and was widely used to prevent tetanus induced by battle wounds during World War II.|$|E

25|$|One {{serotype}} {{and seven}} different genetic groups (four human and three simian) {{have been described}}. The human genotypes are numbered I-III.

A single isolate of genotype VII isolated <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> has also been described. Genotype III has been isolated from both humans and owl monkeys. Most human isolates are of genotype I. Of the type I isolates subtype IA accounts for the majority.|$|E
25|$|Interstitial {{deletion}}s: an intra-chromosomal deletion that {{removes a}} segment of DNA from a single chromosome, thereby apposing previously distant genes.

The abnormal FIG-ROS fusion protein has constitutively active kinase activity that causes oncogenic transformation (a transformation from normal cells to cancer cells).|$|E
25|$|Two {{commonly}} discussed {{types of}} theoretical human cloning are therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning. Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> {{for use in}} medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, as of 2014. Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are somatic-cell nuclear transfer and, more recently, pluripotent stem cell induction. Reproductive cloning would involve making an entire cloned human, instead of just specific cells or tissues.|$|E
