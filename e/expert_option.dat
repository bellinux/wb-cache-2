We studied experts' opinions of the benefit and disadvantage of an incidental prenatal diagnosis of a sex chromosomal aneuploidy (SCA). METHODS: We interviewed 16 experts in the field of counseling and treatment of people with SCA and asked 13 clinical geneticists and genetic associates about the clinical relevance of an incidental prenatal diagnosis of SCA. RESULTS: Most of the experts and clinical geneticists (87. 5 % and 76. 9 %, respectively) stated that an incidental prenatal diagnosis of SCA was a benefit for the child and the parents. They acknowledged the possibility of parental decisions to terminate pregnancy. <b>Expert</b> <b>options</b> in screening, training, and treatment of health, behavior, and fertility problems increase with an early diagnosis of SCA.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{flexible}} knowledge representation framework which utilizes Symbolic Regression {{to learn and}} mathematical expressions to represent the knowledge to be captured from data. In this approach, learning algorithms are used to generate new insights which {{can be added to}} domain knowledge bases supporting again symbolic regression. This is used for the generalization of the well-known regression analysis to fulfill supervised classification. The approach aims to produce a learning model which best separates the class members of a labeled training set. The class boundaries are given by a separation surface which is represented by the level set of a model function. The separation boundary is defined by the respective equation. In our symbolic approach, the learned knowledge model is represented by mathematical formulas and it is composed of an optimum set of expressions of a given superset. We show that this property gives human <b>experts</b> <b>options</b> to gain additional insights into the application domain. Furthermore, the representation in terms of mathematical formulas (e. g., the analytical model and its first and second derivative) adds additional value to the classifier and enables to answer questions, which sub-symbolic classifier approaches cannot. The symbolic representation of the models enables an interpretation by human experts. Existing and previously known expert knowledge can be added to the developed knowledge representation framework or it can be used as constraints. Additionally, the knowledge acquisition framework can be repeated several times. In each step, new insights from the search process can be added to the knowledge base to improve the overall performance of the proposed learning algorithms...|$|R

Maximum entropy copulae introduced by Bedford and Meeuwissen (1997) provide <b>experts</b> the <b>option</b> of making minimally informative assumptions given a degree of dependence constraint between two random variables. Unfortunately, their distributions functions are not available in a closed form, and their application {{requires the use of}} numerical methods. In this paper we shall study a sub-family of generalized diagonal band (GDB) copulae, separately introduced by Ferguson (1995) and Bojarski (2001). Similar to Archimedean copulae, GDB copulae construction require a generator function. Bojarski's GDB copula generator functions are symmetric probability density functions. In this paper, members of a symmetric two-sided framework of distributions introduced by Van Dorp and Kotz (2003) shall be considered. This flexible set-up allows for derivations of GDB copula properties resulting in novel convenient expressions. A straightforward elicitation procedure for the GDB copula dependence parameter is proposed. Closed form expressions for specific examples in the sub-family of GDB copulae are presented, which enhance their transparency and facilitate their application. These examples closely approximate the entropy of maximum entropy copulae. Application of GDB copulae is illustrated via a value of information decision analysis example...|$|R

Virtual options can be modeled as options to “purchase” information items by paying the cost of the information operations involved. Virtual options arise at several stages of value creation. The initial stage involves observation of physical phenomena with accompanying data capture. The next refinement is to organize the data into structured databases. Then information is selected from storage and synthesizing it into an information product (such as a report, article, or design specifications for a product to be fabricated in the physical realm). Then the information product is presented to the user via an efficient interface that does not require the user to be a field <b>expert.</b> Virtual <b>options</b> are similar in concept to real options but substantially different in their details, since real options have physical objects as {{the underlying}} assets and the rules governing exercise are based on the realities of the physical world.
