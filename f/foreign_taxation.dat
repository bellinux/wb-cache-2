This paper reviews the criticism of the standard view (the “old view”) of <b>foreign</b> profit <b>taxation,</b> which goes back to Peggy Musgrave. The “new view” of international taxation is based on recent empirical studies and favours a system in which foreign profits are exempt from tax.

5000|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} {{have the}} ability to put most nations within striking distance of U.S. air power which makes them the cornerstone of US forward deployment and deterrence strategy. Multiple carriers are deployed around the world to provide military presence, respond quickly to crises, and participate in joint exercises with allied forces; this has led the Navy to refer to their Nimitz-class carriers as [...] "4.5 acres of sovereign and mobile American territory". [...] "In accordance with customary international law as reflected in THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA and as discussed in THE COMMANDER'S HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF NAVAL OPERATIONS and THE STATE DEPT CABLE ON THE STATUS OF MILITARY SEALIFT COMMAND VESSELS, ships owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service are entitled to sovereign immunity. Whether in internal, territorial, or international waters, such ships are immune from arrest and search, and exempt from <b>foreign</b> <b>taxation</b> and any foreign regulation requiring flying the flag of that foreign state while in its ports or territorial sea." [...] Former President Bill Clinton summed up the importance of the aircraft carrier by stating that [...] "when word of crisis breaks out in Washington, it's no accident the first question that comes to everyone's lips is: where is the nearest carrier?" [...] The power and operational flexibility of a carrier lie in the aircraft of its carrier air wing. Made up of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, a carrier air wing is able to perform over 150 strike missions at once, hitting over 700 targets a day. Carrier air wings also protect friendly forces, conduct electronic warfare, assist in special operations, and carry out search and rescue missions. The carriers themselves, in addition to enabling airborne operations, serve as command platforms for large battle groups or multinational task forces. U.S. Navy aircraft carriers can also host aircraft from other nations' navies; the French Navy's Rafale has operated, during naval exercises, from U.S. Navy flight decks.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} tax policy on the strategic choices of multinationals and on national welfare. Contrary to existing theory, {{in the absence of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>taxation,</b> deferral of home-country taxation until earnings on outbound FDI are repatriated is generally superior to including those earnings in current income. This holds even if the home country taxes domestic investment less generously. This is also generally superior to exempting foreign income. Foreign taxes permit foreign governments to capture some of the pre-tax economic rent from the home-country FDI; this reduces the benefit to the home country of more generous taxation of outbound FDI...|$|E

We also provide new evidence suggesting that the tax sensitivity of outward foreign direct investment is indeed reduced for OECD countries using foreign tax credits, in comparison with other OECD countries. Finally, we discuss policy considerations surrounding a possible burden-neutral shift from foreign tax creditability to deductibility...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{whether the}} size of multinationals? real {{investments}} in a high-tax country is affected by profit shifting activities. A simple theoretical analysis shows that tax rates abroad impact the cost of capital {{in the presence of}} profit shifting activities of multinational companies. As profit shifting opportunities constitute a competitive advantage, the respective size of investments should theoretically increase if profits can be shifted to a lower taxing country. An empirical analysis, based on a panel of German inbound investments, confirms a positive tax response of real investments with a decreasing tax rate at the foreign direct investor?s home country. Hence, the results suggest that {{the size of}} foreign investments in a high-tax country is positively affected by lower <b>foreign</b> <b>taxation</b> of shifted profits.

40|$|Corporate tax systems {{generally}} {{maintain a}} sharp distinction between debt and equity, however, {{the advent of}} hybrid instruments has transformed the universe offinancial instruments into a debt-equity continuum and tax systems therefore need to draw lines that distinguish the set of debt instruments from the set of equity instruments. When countries draw these lines differently, there is a scope for international tax planning: A multinational firm financing a foreign investment with a hybrid instrument categorized as debt in the host country and equity in the home country combines the benfits of tax deductible interest payments in the host country and tax favored dividend payments in the home country. This paper develops a theoretical model of strategic line drawing between debt and equity {{in the presence of}} hybrid instruments. In the absence of international cooperation, lines are generally drawn in a globally suboptimal manner. The inefficiency ciency typically derives from the endeavors of policymakers to draw lines in ways that facilitate hybrid financing by domestic multinational firms and impede hybrid financing by foreign multinational firms with a view to eroding <b>foreign</b> <b>taxation</b> of domestic firms and enforcing domestic taxation of foreign firms...|$|E
