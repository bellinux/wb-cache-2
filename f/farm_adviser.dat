40|$|For {{providing}} {{systems to}} support decision making {{it is important}} to understand how farmers collect and manage decision information. Using data from a mail survey a ""three-information-area"" and ""four-system-type"" model was tested to describe Canterbury dairy farmer's information management structure. Those using computerised systems in every area were the largest group, but representing only 12 % of farmers. Farmers using computerised systems in different information areas show similar characteristics in contrast to non-users, such as having farmed less years, being younger, having larger herds and bigger farms, being more educated, spending more time doing office work, involving more both <b>farm</b> <b>adviser</b> and accountant time, and being more profit oriented. Those who own computers, but do not use computerised information systems, are not statistically different from those not owning computers. The use of computers for managing feed and pasture information seems to be more restricted than for finance and livestock. The relationships among farm management computer use and the farmer's characteristics were checked using single statistical tests, regression and cluster analyses. The research findings are relevant for those aiming to improve farmer information management and also for farm software developers...|$|E
40|$|In The Netherlands, {{a system}} to control the {{prevalence}} of Salmonella in the pork supply chain is under development by the Product Boards of Livestock, Meat and Eggs. Therefore, the Animal Sciences Group-Applied Research has developed a tool to support pig-finishing farms to control Salmonella. This tool contains eight checklists. The checklists {{are based on the}} principles of the HACCP methodology. Important hazards and control measures were determined. Each checklist deals with a part of the farm procedures; supply of water, piglets, pelleted feed, cereals, roughage, liquid co-products and hygiene and daily management. By means of the developed tool, farm specific control measures to reduce the introduction and spread of Salmonella can easily be identified by the farmer. The effectiveness and practical feasibility of the checklists are determined by implementing advised measures during eight months at three finishing farms. These farms had a high Salmonella prevalence in august 2001. The finishing pigs were tested bacteriologically and serologically every three months. At the end of the testing period, the farmers completed an evaluation form to get insight in the farmers' opinion of the checklists. The farmers indicated the checklists are user-friendly, complete and recommendable to other pig farmers. The measures that were advised after completing the checklists were mostly general in nature. At one farm the percentage of positive samples decreased. The other two farms had only a few positive samples during the entire research period. To maximise the benefit of the checklists, the checklists should be completed along with a <b>farm</b> <b>adviser</b> or veterinarian. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|E

Both schemes had similar objectives. Participants in each followed a grant aided farm development plan drawn up and operated in conjunction with their <b>farm</b> <b>adviser.</b> Nearly three quarters of farmers participated in either the FIP or FMS. This study was carried out on a sample of 145 FIP participant farms. The objective {{was to assess the}} impact of the measure on regional resource use. The average size of the farm business, as measured by standard gross margin, expanded by 15 per cent over the period of the plan. This compared with a planned increase of 9 per cent. Two-thirds of participants expanded the size of their businesses. Some outperformed their gross margin targets to a considerable extent. One-third of farms suffered a decline in gross margins. Stocking rate increased by 9 per cent from 1. 38 to 1. 5 livestock units per ha and the productivity of labour increased by 37 per cent. The internal rate of return to all resources involved (including farm investment, grant aid, administration and advisory costs) was high. Eighty to ninety per cent of the on farm development work was carried out by local labour. While sixty two per cent of applicants reported that they would not have made any investments without the aid of the scheme, 26 per cent said that they would have gone ahead in its absence. The conclusions from the study are as follows: Compared to the rest of Europe Irish agriculture is extensive and under capitalised with a high level of underutilisation of resources. It should therefore be a priority to increase the contribution of agricultural resources to rural and national development by improving their productivity. Because of the high and widespread participation of farmers in both schemes and the positive outcomes on the majority of participant farms, the FIP/FMS programmes seem to provide a suitable model for such development. ...|$|E

Control of animal health problems in organic herds is affected by the restrictions in medicine use and prophylactic medication {{as well as by the}} risk of wildlife contact and difficulties in cleaning and disinfection imposed by the access to outdoor areas. To monitor risk factors for diseases and to control these risks factors as a means to prevent diseases, we suggest the implementation of health management based on Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (the HACCP concept).

The valid responses of the adviser group disclosed that, as stated by the sheep farmer respondents, a very high proportion of sheep farms are capable of greater output if the economic and financial climate is favourable. The advisers intimated, as did the farmers, that just over half of sheep farmers are planning a deliberate increase in output this season (1975 - 76). From a list of suggested incentives to increased <b>farm</b> output the <b>advisers</b> ranked, as did the sheep farmers, an increased fertiliser subsidy as likely to be the most effective. Second ranking was given to a suggested subsidy on interest payments - in contrast to sheep farmers who placed this proposal much lower in their list. Third ranking was the suggestion of a cash grant for each unit of livestock carried. Inadequate farm profitability was rated by the advisers as the greatest single obstacle to an expansion in farm output. Next was the cost of farm requisites and then uncertainty due to fluctuations in export prices. The survey disclosed that <b>farm</b> <b>advisers</b> do not think the level of income tax and death duties as so relevant to an expansion in farm output as do sheep farmers. On the other hand the advisers placed somewhat greater emphasis on the need to reduce the fluctuations of farm product prices and the need for farmers to receive immediate capital via a cash grant for each unit of livestock carried. The advisers regarded the Wool Marketing Corporation as the most effective farmer organisation, ranking it ahead of the Meat Board which sheep farmers placed first on their list.

Risks associated with the adoption of new agricultural technology need to be explored in order to address the transition from homestead food gardening to smallholder irrigated farming. This study seeks to understand risk perception of smallholder irrigation farmers by linking constraints to commercialisation, adoption of new agricultural technologies and risk preferences of smallholder farmers in the former Ciskei Homelands of the Eastern Cape. A total of 101 respondents were surveyed, consisting of 38 smallholder farmers and 63 homestead food gardeners in the Eastern Cape. Questionnaires were used to record household activities, socio-economic and institutional data as well as household demographics through personal interviews. The probit results indicated that older farmers are less risk averse thus more willing to take risk. The risk analysis indicates that farmers who are employed elsewhere are more willing to take risk as income is playing a major role in risk preferences. The results also prove that factors such as tenure system and years in farming have a major influence on farmers’ decision to take risk and adopt new agricultural technology. According to the multi-logit model the major factors influencing technology adoption and risk taking are household size, water rate and type of irrigation system used by the farmers. This study provides useful practical insights for policy makers, <b>farm</b> <b>advisers</b> and researchers in the design of effective and efficient policies, programmes and projects which can affect the adoption of technology, increase smallholder farmers capacity to manage risk and drive growth in the food market...|$|R
40|$|Accelerated {{depreciation}} {{and investment}} allowances are frequently requested by {{industry as a}} means of encouraging investment and promoting the adoption of socially desirable practices by farmers. Examples include the 100 per cent tax deduction for capital expenditure to combat and prevent land degradation (Section 750), and the recently introduced 10 per cent investment allowance for fodder and water storage for livestock, water conveyancing and minimum tillage equipment. Farm level survey data are used to provide evidence of the extent and distribution of benefits to farmers that flow from different rates of depreciation, and from the introduction of a 10 per cent investment allowance. A priori, it may be difficult for the farmer (or <b>farm</b> financial <b>adviser)</b> to determine which depreciation period will provide the largest tax benefit, as the results are dependent on both future taxable incomes, and tax rates.

40|$|THE DATA REQUIREMENTS for an {{assessment}} of the profita-bility of alternative farm management systems are the technical rates of substitution of one enter rise for another, and their price ratios. In a mixed arab e systemP it is necessary to determine relative yields of cash crops, stocking rates and stock performance, and to assess the requirements-of these enterprises for variable and fixed resources. While the basis of analysis would usually. be average yields and current or expected prices, it is often desirable to explore the effect of variation in the critical parameters. Three methods of analysis are available, partial budget-ing, including gross margins analysis, full comparative budgeting, and mathematical programming. Partial analysis is appropriate where the alternatives being compared do not lead to any change in the fixed cost structure. Hence the analysis is carried out in terms of the direct revenue and costs only. Gross margins so derived are in widespread use by <b>farm</b> <b>advisers</b> as a valu-able aid to farm management decision-making. Where substantial changes in the resource structure are involved in any alternatives being analysed, {{it may be necessary to}} carry out full-scale budgeting. For example, in a mixed cropping situation, a land use system with its corresponding stock policy, labour and capital require-ments would be established, and budgeted out against alternative systems. The procedure of comparative budget-ing can clearly become quite laborious if there are more than two or three systems to appraise. In such a case there may be justification for using a mathematical tech-nique which can be programmed for a computer. There has been some experience in applying linear programming to mixed farming problems in New Zealand (Stewart and Nuthall, 1966) but so far this has only been in basic in-vestigational and research work, rather than in routine advisory work. This paper is limited to a brief review of the relative profitability of cash crops under current prices, using gros...|$|R
40|$|Purpose This paper explores {{enterprise}} diversification amongst wetland {{farmers in}} Zambia {{as a way}} of reducing poverty and improving sustainability. It identifies ways in which such entrepreneurial activities can be supported and applied more widely. Method A qualitative study of Zambian farmers, based on a series of workshops and interviews held in Zambia with farmers and <b>farm</b> business <b>advisers.</b> Findings Despite adopting new technologies most farmers are restricted to the local market where their increased production holds down prices. However, {{a very small number of}} farmers are able to progress to production and marketing for markets in major urban centres hundreds of kilometres away, and considerably more are able to use the capital accumulated from wetland farming to diversify their household enterprises to reduce poverty and improve the sustainability and resilience of their livelihoods. Prior work No work has been undertaken in diversification strategies of Small scale farmers in Zambia...|$|R
