Interventions during acute and post-acute hospital care exist not only to improve short-term outcomes but also to prevent future exacerbations and disease progression. We aimed at measuring the <b>implementation</b> <b>rates</b> of acute and post-acute hospital care interventions for AECOPD. Methods: We performed 24  months (January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2013) retrospective medical chart review of consecutive cases hospitalized {{to one of three}} public hospitals in the canton of Zurich due to AECOPD. <b>Implementation</b> <b>rates</b> of five acute care and seven post-acute care interventions were assessed. Results: Data from 263 hospitalizations (61 % male, mean age 68. 5  years, 47 % active smokers) were analyzed. The median length of stay was 9  days (interquartile range [IQR] 6 – 12  days). In all, 32 % of hospitalizations were caused by individuals with previous hospitalizations because of AECOPD. <b>Implementation</b> <b>rates</b> of four acute care interventions were > 75 % (lowest was appropriate antibiotic therapy with 56 %). Compared to this, <b>implementation</b> <b>rates</b> of five post-acute care interventions were < 25 % (lowest was patient education and self-management advice with 2 %).

50|$|The {{implementation}} of SRP differs for discounters and full-line distributors. The <b>implementation</b> <b>rate</b> of full-line distributors averages about 37%, {{and is therefore}} considerably lower than the 90% <b>implementation</b> <b>rate</b> for discounters. However, there are also differences among full-line distributors {{regarding the use of}} SRP. Basic causes are the respective strategies used in the markets. On the one side, some full-line distributors avoid the use of SRP for image-related and aesthetic reasons. On the other hand, some full-line distributors use SRP extensively because of the ease of handling and lower personnel costs. Apart from the strategy followed for individual markets, the decision whether to use SRP or not depends on the variety of goods provided in the market. The use of SRP in the discount trade has already been mentioned; cost savings can be realized while the best possible presentation of the products is possible. Thus, in some cases revenue could be increased up to 35%, partly because of the use of SRP. In addition to the increase in revenue, SRP simplifies work processes and consequently increases productivity. Activities related to in-store logistics, such as storing, unpacking, labelling products and filling the shelves, account for 70% to 80% of the daily business in the food sector. It is clear that potential savings can be generated through the use of SRP.Thanks to printing on the SRP, selecting stock becomes easier. Due to easier and faster replenishment, the largest potential savings result from this improvement to in-store logistics. Depending on container size, 10 to 60 products can be displayed at once on a shelf. To exploit the full potential savings of SRP, it may be removed from the shelf when the last article has been removed. This leads to gaps in the shelves that can affect the purchasing behaviour of customers. Through the use of an integrated product system, which pushes the remaining products {{to the front of the}} SRP whenever one product has been taken from it, shelf gaps can be reduced.|$|E
40|$|Contractors in the Dutch civil {{construction}} industry are adopting Systems Engineering (SE) into their work processes, {{to manage the}} increasingly complex and multi-disciplinary nature of their projects. The <b>implementation</b> <b>rate</b> of SE is low due to unknown problems caused by multiple factors. Currently, there is no overview of the factors affecting the <b>implementation</b> <b>rate</b> of SE in the Dutch civil {{construction industry}} and how these should be managed. Through {{review of existing literature}} and case studies on civil construction projects, a list of factors affecting the successful implementation of SE has been formulated and their relative effect on the <b>implementation</b> <b>rate</b> of SE is determined. In this article six key problem areas are identified, which negatively influence the <b>implementation</b> <b>rate</b> of SE. We propose that contractors adopt a single, independent organizational entity in their organization for process and SE management, who implicitly implement SE within the standard working procedures. Towards the client, these procedures depend on the level of SE-maturity of the client.

Several studies have shown that not all eligible women undergo an ECV attempt. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the implementation of ECV in the Netherlands and to explain variation in <b>implementation</b> <b>rates</b> with hospital characteristics and individual factors. Methods: We invited 40 hospitals to participate in this retrospective cohort study. We reviewed hospital charts for all singleton breech deliveries from 36 weeks' gestation and onwards between January 2008 and December 2009. We documented whether an ECV attempt was performed, reasons for not performing an attempt, mode of delivery, and hospital characteristics. Results: We included 4, 770 women from 36 hospitals. ECV was performed in 2, 443 women (62. 2 % of eligible women, range 8. 2 - 83. 6 % in different hospitals). <b>Implementation</b> <b>rates</b> were higher in teaching hospitals, hospitals with special office hours for ECV, larger obstetric units, and hospitals located in larger cities. Suboptimal implementation was mainly caused by health care providers who did not offer ECV. Conclusion: ECV <b>implementation</b> <b>rates</b> vary widely among hospitals. Suboptimal implementation is mostly caused by the care provider not offering the treatment and secondly due to women not opting for the offered attempt.

40|$|Background and objectives: Medication review {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{as a way to}} prevent drug related problems (DRPs). Screening tools have been formulated to identify potentially inappropriate medicines (PIMs) and potential prescribing omissions (PPOs) respectively called Screening Tool of Older Person's Prescriptions (STOPP) and Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment (START). The aim was to determine the percentage of PIMs and PPOs present in identified potential DRPs and the implementation rates of associated recommendations in elderly patients. Setting and method: A cohort study in a primary care setting. The study was performed in 13 Dutch community pharmacies. Patients were eligible for medication review when they were aged ≥ 65 years and used five of more different drugs. The patient's community pharmacist interviewed patients about their medicines. A pharmaceutical care plan (including DRPs and recommendations) was proposed by the community pharmacist and implemented after agreement with patients' general practitioner. All DRPs identified were retrospectively compared with START- and STOPP-criteria. Main outcome measures: The number and types of potential DRPs identified by the community pharmacist and the <b>implementation</b> <b>rate</b> of associated recommendations. The number of PIMs and PPOs present in identified DRPs using STOPP- and START-criteria and the <b>implementation</b> <b>rate</b> of associated recommendations. Results: The total number of potential DRPs identified by pharmacists was 1, 811 in 507 patients (mean 3. 6 per patient). The most common DRPs were: condition undertreated (419, 23 %), no indication apparent (278, 15 %) and adverse effects (182, 10 %). Using STOPP-criteria, potential DRPs concerning PIMs were present in 15 % of the patients. 84 of 362 recommendations to discontinue a drug (23. 2 %) concerned STOPP-criteria. Using STARTcriteria, PPOs were present in potential DRPs for 33. 3 % of patients. START-criteria were present in 219 of 299 recommendations to add a drug (73. 2 %). 59 % of all recommendations were implemented. The <b>implementation</b> <b>rate</b> for recommendations to discontinue a drug was 49. 1 % compared to 56 % for the subgroup recommendations concerning STOPP-criteria. The <b>implementation</b> <b>rate</b> for recommendations to add a drug was 39. 8 % compared to 36 % for the subgroup START-criteria. Conclusion: Potential prescribing omissions are more prevalent compared to potentially inappropriate drug prescribing among older people living in the community in the Netherlands.

Previous surveys showed that despite this fact implementation rates are still low. The primary aim of the prospective, observational multicenter {{study was to investigate}} the <b>implementation</b> <b>rate</b> of delirium monitoring among intensivists. Secondly, current practice concerning analgesia and sedation monitoring as well as treatment strategies for patients with delirium were assesed. In addition, this study compares perceived and actual practice regarding delirium, sedation and analgesia management. Data were obtained with a two-part, anonymous survey, containing general data from intensive care units in a first part and data referring to individual patients in a second part. Questionnaires from 101 hospitals (part 1) and 868 patients (part 2) were included in data analysis. Fifty-six percent of the intensive care units reported to monitor for delirium in clinical routine. Fourty-four percent reported the use of a validated delirium score. In this respect, the survey suggests an increasing use of delirium assessment tools compared to previous surveys. Nevertheless, part two of the survey revealed that in actual practice 73 % of included patients were not monitored with a validated score. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards moderate or deep sedation which is contradicting to guideline-recommendations. Every fifth patient was suffering from pain.
