5|$|Abandoned mercury mine {{processing}} sites often contain very <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> {{piles of}} roasted cinnabar calcines. Water run-off from such sites is a recognized source of ecological damage. Former mercury mines may be suited for constructive re-use. For example, in 1976 Santa Clara County, California purchased the historic Almaden Quicksilver Mine {{and created a}} county park on the site, after conducting extensive safety and environmental analysis of the property.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> are {{considered}} highly toxic and therefore disposal of such wastes needs proper attention {{so as to}} reduce possible environmental hazards. Industrial growth has resulted in generation of huge volume of <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> in the country. In addition to this, <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> sometimes get imported mainly from the western countries for re-processing or recycling. Inventorisation of <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> generating units {{in the country is}} not yet completed. Scientific disposal of <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> has become a major environmental issue in India. <b>Hazardous</b> <b>Wastes</b> (Management and Handling) Rules, 1989 have been framed by the Central Government and amended in 2000 and 2003 to deal with the <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> related environmental problems that may arise in the near future. This paper gives details about the <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> management in India. Health effects of the selected hazardous substances are also discussed in the paper...|$|R
50|$|<b>Hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> are wastes with {{properties}} {{that make them}} dangerous or potentially harmful to human health or the environment. <b>Hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> can be liquids, solids, contained gases, or sludges. They can be by-products of manufacturing processes or simply discarded commercial products, like cleaning fluids or pesticides. In regulatory terms, RCRA <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> are wastes that appear {{on one of the}} four <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> lists (F-list, K-list, P-list, or U-list), or exhibit at least one of four characteristics-ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity. <b>Hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> are regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C.|$|R

5|$|Superfund {{sites are}} {{designated}} as {{being among the}} nation's worst areas with respect to toxic and <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste.</b> The Environmental Protection Agency is the federal agency that determines if a particular site is hazardous, prepares {{a course of action}} to reduce the hazard, and finds the parties responsible for the pollution. If a site is listed with the Superfund program, federal dollars are available for cleanup.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their high biodiversity, abyssal plains are of great current and future commercial and strategic interest. For example, they {{may be used for}} the legal and illegal disposal of large structures such as ships and oil rigs, radioactive waste and other <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste,</b> such as munitions. They may also be attractive sites for deep-sea fishing, and extraction of oil and gas and other minerals. Future deep-sea waste disposal activities that could be significant by 2025 include emplacement of sewage and sludge, carbon-dioxide sequestration, and disposal of dredge spoils.|$|E
5|$|The {{industry}} {{continues to}} have a serious impact on the environment. In 2012, it produced about 70% of Estonia's ordinary waste, 82% of its <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste,</b> and more than 70% of its greenhouse gas emissions. Its activities lower groundwater levels, alter water circulation, and spoil water quality. Water pumped from the mines and used by oil shale-fired power stations exceeds 90% of all water used in Estonia. Leachates from waste heaps pollute surface and groundwater. Former and current oil shale mines cover about one percent of Estonia's territory.|$|E
2500|$|Under Article 9(1)(d) of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of <b>Hazardous</b> <b>Wastes</b> and Their Disposal, it {{is illegal}} for [...] "any transboundary {{movement}} of <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> or other wastes: that results in deliberate disposal (e.g. dumping) of <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> or other wastes in contravention of this Convention and of general principles of international law".|$|R

Seven major federal regulations control, limit, and manage <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes.</b> Public perceptions of the issues regarding hazardous substances management are clouded due {{to the absence of}} standards for determining acceptable risks, and because it is difficult to distinguish between toxic and hazardous materials. Current technologies used to manage <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> include incineration, use as fuel, solidification and stabilization, solvent and metal recovery, wastewater treatment, disposal in landfills, land treatment, underground injection, and waste minimi- zation and recycling. Effective public policy and practice only will evolve when there is {{a better understanding of the}} problems, development of acceptable public health risk standards and streamlined processes for approval of new facilities, and appropriate incentives for reducing the annual volume of <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes...</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT {{for violating}} the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act with regard to its <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> storage and {{disposal}} procedures. MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects. In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing public transportation passes, and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.|$|E
5|$|The FBI raid {{led to the}} {{formation}} of Colorado's first special grand jury, the juried testimony of 110 witnesses, reviews of 2,000 exhibits and ultimately a 1992 plea agreement in which Rockwell admitted to 10 federal environmental crimes and agreed to pay $18.5 million in fines out of its own funds. This amount was less than the company had been paid in bonuses for running the plant as determined by the GAO, and yet was also by far the highest hazardous-waste fine ever; four times larger than the previous record. Due to DOE indemnification of its contractors, without some form of settlement being arrived at between the U.S. Justice Department and Rockwell the cost of paying any civil penalties would ultimately have been borne by U.S. taxpayers. While any criminal penalties allotted to Rockwell would not have been covered by U.S. taxpayers, Rockwell claimed that the Department of Energy had specifically exempted them from most environmental laws, including <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste.</b>|$|E

In 2007 citywide wireless internet coverage began, provided for 10 years by US Internet of Minnetonka to residents for about $20 per month and to businesses for $30. The Minneapolis Wi-Fi network earns $1.2 million annual profit {{and as of}} 2010 has about 20,000 customers. The city treats and distributes water and requires payment of a monthly solid waste fee for trash removal, recycling, and drop off for large items. Residents who recycle receive a credit. <b>Hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> is handled by Hennepin County drop off sites. After each significant snowfall, called a snow emergency, the Minneapolis Public Works Street Division plows over 1,000 miles (1,609km) of streets and 400 miles (643.7km) of alleys—counting both sides, the distance between Minneapolis and Seattle and back. Ordinances govern parking on the plowing routes during these emergencies as well as snow shoveling throughout the city.|$|E
