Nor is it possible using a <b>dummy</b> <b>pit</b> of U-238 and high-speed x-ray cameras, although such tests are helpful. For final determination, a test needs to be made with real fissile material. Consequently, starting in 1957, a year after Swan, both labs began one-point safety tests.|$|E

This method reduced the time to change from one order to another down from around 8 hours to about 30 minutes.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} is the Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP) for the clean and coat equipment designed by Oceaneering Hanford, Inc. under purchase order MDK-XVC- 406988 {{for use in}} the 105 K East Basin. The ATP provides the guidelines and criteria to test the equipment`s ability to clean and coat the concrete perimeter, divider walls, and <b>dummy</b> elevator <b>pit</b> above the existing water level. This equipment was designed and built in support of the Spent Nuclear Fuel, Dose Reduction Project. The ATP will be performed at the 305 test facility in the 300 Area at Hanford. The test results will be documented in WHC-SD-SNF-ATR- 020...|$|R
40|$|Samples of sludge were {{collected}} from the K East fuel storage basin (KE Basin) floor, contiguous pits (Weasel Pit, North Load Out <b>Pit,</b> <b>Dummy</b> Elevator <b>Pit,</b> and Tech View Pit), and fuel storage canisters between 1995 and 2003 for chemical and radionuclide concentration analysis, physical property determination, and chemical process testing work. Because {{of the value of}} the sludge in this testing and because of the cost of obtaining additional fresh samples, an ongoing program of sludge preservation has taken place with the goals to track the sludge identities and preserve, as well as possible, the sludge composition by keeping the sludge in sealed jars and maintaining water coverage on the sludge consistent with the controlling Fluor Hanford (FH) Sampling and Analysis plans and FH contracts with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). This work was originally initiated to provide material for planned hydrothermal treatment testing in accordance with the test plan for the Sludge Treatment Project (STP) corrosion process chemistry follow on testing (Delegard et al. 2007). Although most of the planned hydrothermal testing was canceled in July 2007 (as described in the forward of Delegard et al. 2007), sample consolidation and characterization was continued to identify a set of well-characterized sludge samples that are suited to support evolving STP initiatives. The work described in the letter was performed by the PNNL under the direction of the Sludge Treatment Project, managed by Fluor Hanford...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of particle size analyses and calorimetry testing performed on selected single-pull sludge samples collected from the Hanford K East Basin between December 1998 and June 1999. The samples were collected as isolated cores predominantly from areas that had not been previously sampled (e. g., North Loadout <b>Pit,</b> <b>Dummy</b> Elevator <b>Pit,</b> Tech View Pit), or from areas in which the sludge composition had been altered since the last sampling (e. g., Weasel Pit). Particle size analyses were performed by washing wet sludge samples through a series of four sieves with openings of 250, 500, 1410, and 4000 {micro}m. The loaded sieves were weighed before and after drying to obtain wet and dry particle size distributions. Knowledge of the particle size distribution is needed to design and predict the performance of the systems that will be used to retrieve, transport, and recover sludge. Also, sieving provides an opportunity to observe the components in the sludge. For example, during sieving of the sludge sample from the North Loadout Pit, significant quantities of organic ion exchange beads were observed. The uranium metal content and the particle size of the uranium metal in the K Basin sludge will largely determine the chemical reactivity of the sludge. In turn, the designs for the sludge handling and storage systems must be compatible with the reactivity of the sludge. Therefore, acid calorimetry was performed to estimate the uranium metal content of the sludge. For this testing, sludge samples were dissolved in nitric acid within a calibrated adiabatic calorimeter. The resulting dissolution enthalpy data were then used to discriminate between metallic uranium ({minus} 3750 J/g in nitric acid) and uranium oxide ({minus} 394 J/g in nitric acid). Results from this testing showed that the single-pull sludge samples contained little or no uranium metal...|$|R
40|$|The 105 -KE Basin {{contains}} 1, 150 Metric Tonnes of Uranium (MTU) of N Reactor fuel, {{along with}} {{less than half a}} MTU of single pass reactor (SPR) fuel. In addition to the spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in the 105 -KE Basin, extensive quantities of debris and a substantial amount of sludge have accumulated in the basin. The 105 -KE Basin fuel and sludge are not encapsulated and, as a result, corroding fuel has produced contamination products that are deposited on the basin walls, floor, and equipment. contamination products produce radiation dose exposures to the workers. To decrease worker exposures, this Notice of Construction (NOC) describes dose reduction modifications under consideration to mitigate worker radiation exposure from the basin walls and exposed piping. The major equipment egress paths from the basin (the <b>dummy</b> elevator <b>pit</b> and the south loadout pit) are blocked completely with debris and/or empty canisters. Therefore in addition to dose reduction, this NOC also describes debris removal activities and equipment. Recently, the primary water treatment system has been without mechanical filtration capabilities. This NOC describes planned modifications to the primary water treatment system to restore mechanical filtration by restarting the cartridge filters. The proposed modifications described in this NOC are expected to commence in the Fall of 1995. Finally, the NOC describes two other basin activities, fuel and sludge movement, that are expected to be routine in the future...|$|R
40|$|Floor sludge {{constituent}} {{masses and}} their spatial distribution within K East Basin were calculated. This {{information will be}} beneficial in the assessing the acceptability of K Basin sludge in the Tank Waste Remediation System and in the design and/or operational practices related to retrieval and handling of this K Basin sludge. Calculations were made based on results from recent laboratory chemical and radionuclides analyses of sludge sampled from thirteen locations in K East main basin. This concentration data was mathematically processed to determine the various constituents concentration distribution throughout the basin floor. This data was further processed, along with data previously generated from the analysis of measured sludge depths, to give both basin total masses and associated spatial distribution of the various sludge constituents. Results of these calculations, showed that the major gravimetric constituents of the sludge are iron (1505 kg), uranium (1387 kg), aluminum, sodium and c 2 @ 15 cium. Significant amounts of fissionable materials were also calculated: u (9. 92 kg) and 239 pU (3. 42 kg). The calculated distribution of sludge constituent masses showed distinct patterns. Sludge constituent associated with corroded spent nuclear fuel were concentrated near the north-west corner of the basin. Aluminum and iron, and many other elements are mainly located {{near the mouth of}} the South Load Out Pit. A value of 10, 200 Ci of alpha (5 %) + beta (95 %) radioactivity was calculated for the total basin floor sludge, and was concentrated near the north-west corner of the basin and near the <b>Dummy</b> Elevator <b>Pit...</b>|$|R
