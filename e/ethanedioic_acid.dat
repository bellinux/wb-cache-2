40|$|A novel {{photoinduced}} luminescence {{film has}} been prepared by immobilizing pyrene on a quartz plate surface via a flexible long spacer. The film shows combined monomer and excimer emission of pyrene both in {{wet and dry}} states, and the excimer may be formed mainly by direct excitation of ground-state dimers and/or monomers in aggregates. Classical Birks ’ scheme plays a little role {{in the formation of}} the excimers. The emission of the film is sensitive to the presence of dicarboxylic acids, including <b>ethanedioic</b> <b>acid,</b> malonic acid, succinic acid, etc. The emission in the monomer and excimer region increases with addition of the acids. The time needed for the emission to reach equilibrium depends on the nature of the acids. It has been shown that the longer the chains of the acids, the more time is needed. This observation is explained by considering the conformational reorganization of the immobilized pyrene due to insertion of the dicarboxylic acids into the space between neighboring spacers. Experimental results from similar studies using formic acid and acetic acid are in support of this explanation. Furthermore, the response of the film to dicarboxylic acids is reversible...|$|E

Pattern recognition analysis, including both principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminate analysis revealed that ketamine (50 mg/kg) induced metabolic perturbations. Compared with the control group, at day 7, the level of alanine, butanoic acid, glutamine, butanedioic, trimethylsiloxy, L-aspartic acid, D-glucose, cholesterol, acetamide, and oleic acid of the ketamine group was increased, while the level of 2, 3, 4 -trihydroxybutyric acid, benzene­acetic acid, threitol, ribitol, xylitol, and glycine decreased. At day 14, the level of alanine, <b>ethanedioic</b> <b>acid,</b> L-proline, glycerol, tetradecanoic acid, l-serine, l-phenylalanine, L-aspartic acid, d-glucose, cholesterol, heptadecanoic acid, and acetamide in rat urine of the ketamine group was increased, while the 2, 3, 4 -trihydroxybutyric acid, benzeneacetic acid, d-ribose, threitol, ribitol, glycine, pyrazine, and oleic acid levels decreased. Our results indicate that metabonomic methods based on GC-MS {{may be useful to}} elucidate ketamine abuse, through the exploration of biomarkers. Keywords: GC-MS, abuse, biomarker, metabolit...|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} of our recent studies dealing with infrared-induced conformational interconversion of carboxylic acids isolated in rare-gas matrices is presented. Extensive rotational photoisomerization {{studies have been}} performed on formic acid, which is the simplest organic acid enabling this kind of processes. Formic acid has two conformers and interconversion between them can be induced by vibrational excitation. As such, it is an ideal model system to study the conformational dynamics of the carboxylic group. Formic acid molecules {{were found to be}} isolated in different local environments within the rare-gas matrices, as shown by the site splitting of the vibrational bands. Narrowband tunable infrared (IR) radiation was used to induce site-selective isomerization processes. The induced changes in the IR absorption spectra allowed for a detailed analysis of the vibrational properties of both conformers of formic acid isolated in solid argon. In particular, derived from the intermode coupling constants the local environment was shown to affects the intramolecular potential energy surface. Tunneling is involved in the rotamerization of formic acid, with the tunneling rate being affected by the local environment. Additionally, formic acid exhibits isomer-selective photodissociation where narrowband IR excitation can control the conformer-dependent photodissociation channels. Tunable IR radiation was also used to promote rotamerization in a series of matrix-isolated dicarboxylic <b>acids</b> (<b>ethanedioic,</b> propanedioic, and 2 -butenedioic acids) by exciting the first overtone of the O [...] -H stretching mode or a suitable combination mode at similar energies. Efficient isomerization involving rotation around the C [...] -O bond was observed in most cases whereas the internal rotation around the C [...] -C bond was found to be constrained for ethanedioic and (Z) - 2 -butenedioic acids.

40|$|Electron-transfer (ET) {{is one of}} the {{simplest}} chemical events, yet it is a vital process for chemical reactivity. Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is the concerted transfer of protons and electrons which is fundamental in chemical and biological systems and processes in electrochemistry, photosynthesis, and enzymatic activity. Similarly, mixed-valence (MV) systems are pervasive in nature and provide a platform for multiple electron transfers systems in nature. While both fields have been studied extensively, little work has been done on the intersection of the two. This project explores the elegant use of MV bimetallic systems through hydrogen-bonded networks. Using standard Schlenk and glovebox techniques, a variety of compounds have been synthesized using Mo 2 (DAniF) 3 (O 2 CCH 3) (where DAniF is the anion of N,N’-di-p-anisylformamidine) as the starting material, and further reacted with four different bisbidentate ligands (2, 5 -dihydroxy- 1, 4 -benzoquinone, 3, 4 -dihydroxycyclobut- 3 -ene- 1, 2 -dione, N,N’-dimethyloxamide, <b>ethanedioic</b> <b>acid).</b> Using cyclic (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in THF and in THF with water, a comproportionation constant, Kc, of 1 x 102 is calculated which shows that there is a hydrogen-bonded dimer in solution. The rate of ET in the hydrogen-bonded system is several orders of magnitude lower compared to the covalently bridged dimer. The electronic communication between the hydrogen-bonded dimers can be described as ‘semi-localized’ Class II based on the Robin-Day classification. Density Functional Theory calculations support these findings...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>ethanedioic</b> <b>acid</b> (EdA) {{functionalization}} on Al 2 O 3 supported Ni catalyst was studied on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), isomerization, kinetics and Arrhenius parameters of octadec- 9 -enoic acid (OA) into biofuel in this report. This was achieved via synthesis of two catalysts; the first, nickel alumina catalyst (Ni/Al 2 O 3) was via {{the incorporation of}} inorganic Ni precursor into Al 2 O 3; the second was via the incorporation nickel oxalate (NiOx) prepared by functionalization of Ni with EdA into Al 2 O 3 to obtain organometallic NiOx/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. Their characterization results showed that Ni species present in Ni/Al 2 O 3 and NiOx/Al 2 O 3 were 8. 2 % and 9. 3 %, respectively according to the energy dispersive X-ray result. NiOx/Al 2 O 3 has comparably higher Ni content due to the EdA functionalization which also increases its acidity and guarantees high Ni dispersion with weaker metal-support-interaction leading to highly reducible Ni {{as seen in the}} X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, TPR and Raman spectroscopy results. Their activities tested on the HDO of OA showed that NiOx/Al 2 O 3 did not only display the best catalytic and reusability abilities, but it also possesses isomerization ability due to its increased acidity. The NiOx/Al 2 O 3 also has the highest rate constants evaluated using pseudo-first-order kinetics, but the least activation energy of 176 kJ/mol in the biofuel formation step compared to 244 kJ/mol evaluated when using Ni/Al 2 O 3. The result is promising for future feasibility studies toward commercialization of catalytic HDO of OA into useful biofuel using organometallic catalysts...|$|E
40|$|The waste {{byproducts}} {{from the}} indium-consuming fabrication processes are considered as the viable resource for indium {{due to the}} unique preference to the element in designing optoelectronic devices. The present work introduces a new technique for the selective recovery of indium from the etching waste, which produced during the patterning of indium tin oxide (ITO) layer on the flat-panel displays. The process includes {{the application of a}} solid phase extraction (SPE) assembly, known as molecular recognition technology (MRT) gel, consisting of a metal-selective ligand immobilized to silica gel or polymer substrates. The samples were the real solution of etching waste from the liquid-crystal display fabrication process, and the simulated waste solution prepared using the commercially available etching solution composition containing <b>ethanedioic</b> <b>acid.</b> The retention and the corresponding indium recovery rate (%) were the key characteristics for the appraisal of MRT-SPE types: AnaLig TE 02 (TE 02), AnaLig TE 03, AnaLig TE 07, AnaLig TE 13 and AnaLig PM 02. The other conclusive factors were the influence of ion intensity in solution and the interfering effects from tin, the co-content element in the ITO-formulation. The TE 02 MRT-SPE came across all the requisite aspects for the selective recovery of indium from the etching effluent. The indium retention or recovery with TE 02 MRT-SPE from the real etching waste solution was in the range of 97 to 99 % with the relative standard deviation of < 4. 4 %. The separation of the ITO co-element tin from the waste mixture was successively selective, and thereby minimizes the possibility of interference. A three-step elution with 0. 3 molL- 1 HNO 3, 6 molL- 1 HCl and 1 molL- 1 HCl/ 10 mmolL- 1 EDTA was required to accomplish the sequential selectivity in the process.

40|$|A {{headspace}} solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) procedure {{based on}} five commercialised fibres (85 μm polyacrylate – PA, 100 μm polydimethylsiloxane – PDMS, 65 μm polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene – PDMS/DVB, 70 μm carbowax/divinylbenzene – CW/DVB and 85 μm carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane – CAR/PDMS) is presented for {{the characterization of}} the volatile metabolite profile of four selected Madeira island fruit species, lemon (Citrus limon), kiwi (Actinidia deliciosa), papaya (Carica papaya L.) and Chickasaw plum (Prunus angustifolia). The isolation of metabolites was followed by thermal desorption gas chromatography–quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC–qMS) methodology. The performance of the target fibres was evaluated and compared. The SPME fibre coated with CW/DVB afforded the highest extraction efficiency in kiwi and papaya pulps, while in lemon and plum the same was achieved with PMDS/DVB fibre. This procedure allowed for the identification of 80 compounds, 41 in kiwi, 24 in plums, 23 in papaya and 20 in lemon. Considering the best extraction conditions, the most abundant volatiles identified in kiwi were the intense aldehydes and ethyl esters such as (E) - 2 -hexenal and ethyl butyrate, while in Chicasaw plum predominate 2 -hexenal, 2 -methyl- 4 -pentenal, hexanal, (Z) - 3 -hexenol and cyclohexylene oxide. The major compounds identified in the papaya pulp were benzyl isothiocyanate, linalool oxide, furfural, hydroxypropanone, linalool and acetic acid. Finally, lemon was shown {{to be the most}} divergent of the four fruits, being its aroma profile composed almost exclusively by terpens, namely limonene, γ-terpinene, o-cymene and α-terpinolene. Thirty two volatiles were identified {{for the first time in}} the fruit or close related species analysed and 14 volatiles are reported as novel volatile metabolites in fruits. This includes 5 new compounds in kiwi (2 -cyclohexene- 1, 4 -dione, furyl hydroxymethyl ketone, 4 -hydroxydihydro- 2 (3 H) -furanone, 5 -acetoxymethyl- 2 -furaldehyde and <b>ethanedioic</b> <b>acid),</b> 4 in plum (4 -hydroxydihydro- 2 (3 H) -furanone, 5 -methyl- 2 -pyrazinylmethanol, cyclohexylene oxide and 1 -methylcyclohexene), 4 in papaya (octaethyleneglycol, 1, 2 -cyclopentanedione, 3 -methyl- 1, 2 -cyclopentanedione and 2 -furyl methyl ketone) and 2 in lemon (geranyl farnesate and safranal). It is noteworthy that among the 15 volatile metabolites identified in papaya, 3 -methyl- 1, 2 -cyclopentanedione was previously described as a novel PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ) agonist, having a potential to minimize inflammation...|$|E
