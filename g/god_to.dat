The Rabbis compared <b>God's</b> action <b>to</b> those of a king who has both a wife and a concubine; to his wife he goes openly, but to his concubine he goes stealthily. And a Midrash taught that <b>God's</b> appearance <b>to</b> Laban in [...] and <b>God's</b> appearance <b>to</b> Abimelech in [...] were the two instances where the Pure and Holy One allowed <b>God's</b> self <b>to</b> be associated with impure (idolatrous) people, on behalf of righteous ones.|$|R

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{stated that}} he was a {{messenger}} of God, and he used the term Manifestation of <b>God</b> <b>to</b> define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God. In the Bahá'í writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization. The Manifestations of God, as explained by Bahá'u'lláh, are not incarnations of God, but have a two-fold station; one which is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not God's essence, and one which is human in that they represent the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that God will never manifest his essence into the world.|$|E

5|$|Crowning ceremonies {{arose from}} a worldview in which monarchs {{were seen as}} ordained by <b>God</b> <b>to</b> serve not merely as {{political}} or military leaders, nor as figureheads, but rather to occupy a vital spiritual place in their dominions as well. Coronations were created to reflect and enable these alleged connections; however, the belief systems {{that gave birth to}} them have been radically altered in recent centuries by secularism, egalitarianism and the rise of constitutionalism and democracy. During the Protestant Reformation, the idea of divinely ordained monarchs began to be challenged.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of Dexter, after hearing a voice that he thinks is God telling him to murder people, Ned Flanders becomes a serial killing vigilante, {{targeting}} characters who are Homer's enemies. When Flanders discovers that Homer {{is the one who}} has been duping him into committing murder (by way of a Bible-shaped receiver), Homer argues that God does not exist and starts burning Ned's bible, only to be stopped and strangled to death by God Himself. Marge begs <b>God</b> <b>to</b> reverse everything that has happened, but God tells her that Satan is the one who is running the world. When Flanders thinks that this scenario cannot get any worse, it is revealed that Satan is sleeping with Ned's deceased wife, Maude.|$|E
5|$|Integrating elves into Christian {{cosmology}} without identifying them as demons. The {{most striking}} examples are serious theological treatises: the Icelandic Tíðfordrif (1644) by Jón Guðmundsson lærði or, in Scotland, Robert Kirk's Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns and Fairies (1691). This approach also {{appears in the}} Old English poem Beowulf, which lists elves among the races springing from Cain's murder of Abel. The late thirteenth-century South English Legendary and some Icelandic folktales explain elves as angels that sided neither with Lucifer nor with God, and were banished by <b>God</b> <b>to</b> earth rather than hell. One famous Icelandic folktale explains elves as the lost children of Eve.|$|E
