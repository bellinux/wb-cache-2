5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level {{at the center of}} the tube is higher than at the edges, making the upper surface of the mercury <b>dome-shaped.</b> The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the entire cross-section of the tube. But the <b>dome-shaped</b> top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E
5|$|This munia eats mainly {{grass seeds}} apart from berries and small insects. They forage in flocks and {{communicate}} with soft calls and whistles. The species is highly social and may sometimes roost with other species of munias. This species is found in tropical plains and grasslands. Breeding pairs construct <b>dome-shaped</b> nests using grass or bamboo leaves.|$|E
5|$|Frogs in the genera Heleioporus and Neobatrachus lack vocal sacs but {{can still}} produce a loud call. Their buccal cavity is {{enlarged}} and <b>dome-shaped,</b> {{acting as a}} resonance chamber that amplifies the sound. Species of frog that lack vocal sacs and {{that do not have}} a loud call tend to inhabit areas close to constantly noisy, flowing water. They need to use an alternative means to communicate. The coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei) lives in mountain streams in North America and does not vocalize.|$|E
5|$|Larvae {{of members}} of the family Glossosomatidae in the {{suborder}} Spicipalpia create <b>dome-shaped</b> enclosures of silk which enables them to graze on the periphyton, the biological film that grows on stones and other objects, while carrying their enclosure around like turtles. In the family Philopotamidae, the nets are sac-like, with intricate structure and tiny mesh. The larvae have specialised mouthparts to scrape off the microflora that get trapped in the net as water flows through.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of tadpoles lack lids, but at metamorphosis, {{the cornea}} becomes more <b>dome-shaped,</b> the lens becomes flatter, and eyelids and {{associated}} glands and ducts develop. The adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were {{a first step}} in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes. They allow colour vision and depth of focus. In the retinas are green rods, which are receptive {{to a wide range of}} wavelengths.|$|E
5|$|Much more {{is known}} of the {{hundreds}} of unique cleitean that decorate the archipelago. These <b>dome-shaped</b> structures are constructed of flat boulders with a cap of turf on the top. This enables the wind to pass through the cavities in the wall but keeps the rain out. They were used for storing peat, nets, grain, preserved flesh and eggs, manure, and hay, and as a shelter for lambs in winter. The date of origin of this St Kildan invention is unknown, but they were in continuous use from prehistoric times until the 1930 evacuation. More than 1,200 ruined or intact cleitean remain on Hirta and a further 170 on the neighbouring islands. House no. 16 in the modern village has an early Christian stone cross built into the front wall, which may date from the 7th century.|$|E
5|$|The King Island emu and the {{mainland}} emu show few morphological differences {{other than their}} significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of {{the mainland}} emu, yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the culmen, whereas it was four times longer in the mainland emu. Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland emu have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the cranium. However, the distal foramen is known to be variable in the mainland emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The same is true of the contour of the cranium, which is more <b>dome-shaped</b> in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus.|$|E
5|$|The {{head has}} an unusual shape for a crocodilian, with a <b>dome-shaped</b> skull {{and a short}} smooth, concave snout with an upturned tip, the shape rather {{resembling}} {{the head of a}} dog. The upper jaw extends markedly further forward than the lower jaw. There are four pre-maxillary and fourteen to fifteen maxillary teeth {{on either side of the}} upper jaw and twenty-one or twenty-two teeth on each side of the lower jaw giving a total of about eighty teeth. The neck is relatively slender and the dorsal scutes are less prominent than in the smooth-fronted caiman (Paleosuchus trigonatus). The double row of scutes on the tail are small and project vertically. Adults are dark brownish-black with a dark brown head while juveniles are brown with black bands. The iris of the eye is chestnut brown at all ages and the pupil is a vertical slit.|$|E
5|$|After the 1940s, the Gothic style {{on campus}} began {{to give way}} to modern styles. In 1955, Eero Saarinen was {{contracted}} to develop a second master plan, which led to the construction of buildings both north and south of the Midway, including the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle (a complex designed by Saarinen); a series of arts buildings; a building designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for the university's School of Social Service Administration, a building which is to become the home of the Harris School of Public Policy Studies by Edward Durrell Stone, and the Regenstein Library, the largest building on campus, a brutalist structure designed by Walter Netsch of the Chicago firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Another master plan, designed in 1999 and updated in 2004, produced the Gerald Ratner Athletics Center (2003), the Max Palevsky Residential Commons (2001), South Campus Residence Hall and dining commons (2009), a new children's hospital, and other construction, expansions, and restorations. In 2011, the university completed the glass <b>dome-shaped</b> Joe and Rika Mansueto Library, which provides a grand reading room for the university library and prevents the need for an off-campus book depository.|$|E
5|$|Ants of this genus {{prefer to}} inhabit grasslands, forests, heath, urban areas and {{woodland}}. Nests {{are found in}} Callitris forest, dry marri forest, Eucalyptus woodland and forests, mallee scrub, in paddocks, riparian woodland, and wet and dry sclerophyll forests. They also live in dry sandplains, and coastal plain. When a queen establishes a new colony, the nest is at first quite simple structurally. The nest gradually expands as the colony grows larger. Nests {{can be found in}} debris, decaying tree stumps, rotten logs, rocks, sand, and soil, and under stones. While most species nest underground, M. mjobergi is an arboreal nesting species found on epiphytic ferns of the genus Platycerium. Two types of nests have been described for this genus: a simple nest with a noticeable shaft inside, and a complex structure surrounded by a mound. Some species construct <b>dome-shaped</b> mounds containing a single entrance, but some nests have numerous holes that are constantly used and can extend several metres underground. Sometimes, these mounds can be 0.5 m (20in) high. Workers decorate these nests with a variety of items, including charcoal, leaves, plant fragments, pebbles, and twigs. Some ants use the warmth by decorating their nests with dry materials that heat quickly, providing the nest with solar energy traps.|$|E
5|$|The unranked group Isostylis, {{with its}} one species, was {{reclassified}} as a {{section in the}} 1856 arrangement of Carl Meissner, and 1870 arrangement of George Bentham. In his 1981 revision of the genus, Alex George reclassified {{the group as a}} subgenus—Banksia subg. Isostylis—defined by the <b>dome-shaped</b> flower heads, with B.ilicifolia joined by newly described species B.cuneata and later B.oligantha. Banksia ilicifolia is the only common member of that subgenus; the two other species are rare and threatened, and are protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Relationships between B.ilicifolia and the other members of B.subg. Isostylis still remain unclear. Although DNA studies found B.cuneata to be the most basal of the three species, a 2004 study of genetic divergence within the subgenus yielded both other possibilities: some analyses suggested B.ilicifolia as basal, while others suggested B.oligantha. Biogeographical factors suggest that B.ilicifolia would be the most basal of the three species: it occurs in the High Rainfall Zone where relictual species are most common, whereas the others are restricted to the Transitional Rainfall Zone, where more recently evolved species are most common.|$|E
5|$|Fieldwork in 1996 {{turned up}} a spectacularly {{complete}} theropod skull preserved in exquisite detail (FMNH PR 2100). On top of this skull was a <b>dome-shaped</b> swelling nearly {{identical to the one}} described by Sues and Taquet as Majungatholus atopus. Majungatholus was redescribed as an abelisaurid rather than a pachycephalosaur in 1998. Although the name Majungasaurus crenatissimus was older than Majungatholus atopus, the authors judged the type dentary of Majungasaurus too fragmentary to confidently assign to the same species as the skull. Further fieldwork over the next decade {{turned up a}} series of less complete skulls, as well as dozens of partial skeletons of individuals ranging from juveniles to adults. Project members also collected hundreds of isolated bones and thousands of shed Majungasaurus teeth. Taken together, these remains represent nearly all the bones of the skeleton, although most of the forelimbs, most of the pelvis and the tip of the tail are still unknown. This fieldwork culminated in a 2007 monograph consisting of seven scientific papers on all aspects of the animal's biology, published in the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Memoirs. The papers are in English, although each has an abstract written in Malagasy. In this volume, the dentary described by Lavocat was re-evaluated and determined to be diagnostic for this species. Therefore, the name Majungatholus was replaced by the older name Majungasaurus. Although the monograph is comprehensive, the editors noted that it describes only material recovered from 1993 through 2001. A significant quantity of specimens, some very complete, were excavated in 2003 and 2005 and await preparation and description in future publications. The dentary was made the neotype specimen after a 2009 petition to the ICZN.|$|E

25|$|Salad Shakers – A {{salad of}} lettuce, croutons and other {{vegetables}} {{in a tall}} <b>dome-shaped</b> plastic container. Salad Shakers were introduced {{in the spring of}} 2000 and are still available in the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|The brown awl lays many eggs on {{a single}} plant, one at a time, on the tips of fresh shoots. The <b>dome-shaped</b> egg is pale green with {{longitudinal}} ridges having fine beadings; a total 13 ridges in all.|$|E
25|$|One {{expression}} of the different cultures {{of the three major}} language groups was how they constructed their houses, both in style and materials. The Monacan, who spoke a Siouan language, created <b>dome-shaped</b> structures covered with bark and reed mats.|$|E
25|$|Mudun is {{situated}} in the Wadi valley of the Iskushuban District. The area features a number of ruins, which local tradition holds belong to an ancient, large town. Among the old structures are around 2,000 tombs, which possess high towers and are <b>dome-shaped.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{mountain}} is partially <b>dome-shaped,</b> with its famously jagged ridges extending to the sides. Mount Whitney {{is above the}} tree line and has an alpine climate and ecology. Very few plants grow near the summit: {{one example is the}} Skypilot, a cushion plant that grows low to the ground.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, a {{restaurant}} with a <b>dome-shaped</b> roof, known as Dome of the Sea, operated on the property. From 1976 to 1978, Johnny Elvis Foster starred in his Elvis show, For The Love Of Elvis, at the Dunes' showroom. Shenker was Foster's godfather. Foster was the first Elvis impersonator before Elvis died.|$|E
25|$|Haycock is a {{mountain}} {{in the western part}} of the English Lake District. It rises between Scoat Fell and Caw Fell to the south of Ennerdale and the north of Wasdale. Haycock is an imposing <b>dome-shaped</b> fell, its popularity with walkers diminished somewhat by its remoteness. It can be climbed from either valley and offers fine mountain views.|$|E
25|$|It is a lignotuberous shrub {{that grows}} to {{a height of}} from 50 to 70 {{centimetres}}. It has erect leaves with woolly undersides, nine to fifteen centimetres long, and twelve to eighteen millimetres wide. As with other dryandras, it has a <b>dome-shaped</b> inflorescence. B.prionophyllas inflorescence is terminal on a branch, and consists of around 60 greenish-pink flowers.|$|E
25|$|Most coccinellids have {{round to}} elliptical, <b>dome-shaped</b> bodies with six short legs. Depending on the species, {{they can have}} spots, stripes, or no {{markings}} at all. Seven-spotted coccinellids are red or orange with three spots on each side {{and one in the}} middle; they have a black head with white patches on each side.|$|E
25|$|Forewing curvature, {{such that}} it is {{distinctly}} convex or <b>dome-shaped,</b> is also exhibited {{by at least one}} species of the genera Cremnomymar, Mymarilla, Parapolynema, and Richteria. Most of these species inhabit particularly harsh and wind-swept environments, and the curvature may help in absorbing and retaining heat or prevent the fairyflies from being blown away.|$|E
25|$|The O2 {{is a large}} {{entertainment}} district on the Greenwich peninsula in South East London, England, {{including an}} indoor arena, a music club, a Cineworld cinema, an exhibition space, piazzas, bars and restaurants. It was built largely within the former Millennium Dome, a large <b>dome-shaped</b> building built to house an exhibition celebrating {{the turn of the}} third millennium; as such, The Dome remains a name in common usage for the venue.|$|E
25|$|T-54-2 (Ob'yekt 137R) or T-54 Model 1949 – Produced 1949–1952. It {{incorporated}} {{a number of}} improvements to the turret, as well a wider track (580mm) and modernized transmission. The turret is <b>dome-shaped</b> with flat sides (inspired by the IS-3 heavy tanks), similar to later T-54s but with a distinctive overhang at the rear. The hull machine gun replaced the fender bin mounted ones. It also had a shorter bustle.|$|E
25|$|Samanea saman {{generally}} grow {{to between}} 15m and 25m tall {{with a broad}} <b>dome-shaped</b> canopy typically 30m in diameter. The trees leading to St David's Church are substantial and mature; some about 15m tall with canopies of about 30m in diameter. Some of the trees have multiple trunks, the circumferences of which being between 6m to 10m. Ferns and other epiphytes grow from the trunk and branches of several trees.|$|E
25|$|According to E. Baldwin Smith, {{from the}} late Stone Age the <b>dome-shaped</b> tomb {{was used as a}} {{reproduction}} of the ancestral, god-given shelter made permanent as a venerated home of the dead. The instinctive desire to do this resulted in widespread domical mortuary traditions across the ancient world, from the stupas of India to the tholos tombs of Iberia. By Hellenistic and Roman times, the domical tholos had become the customary cemetery symbol.|$|E
25|$|These big sculptures {{are in fact}} modular, {{unlike the}} {{remaining}} nuraghe models from Sardinia, in that the shaft of the mast tower is joined to the top part through an inter-space, whose pivot and binder is constituted by a core of lead. Upper platforms have been faithfully represented in the various nuraghe models. On {{the top of the}} towers a conical, <b>dome-shaped</b> element has been sculpted, indicating the covering of a staircase leading to the platform itself.|$|E
25|$|The tomb was {{originally}} {{designed by the}} Iranian architect, Haj Hossein Lurzadeh who aside from Ferdowsi's tomb also created some 842 mosques, {{as well as the}} private palace of Ramsar, part of the decoration of the Marmar palace, the Imam Hossein Mosque in Tehran, the Motahari Mosque, and various parts of the Hazrat-i-Seyyed-o-Shouhada shrine in Karbala, Iraq. The present design of the structure is credited mainly to Karim Taherzadeh, who replaced the old <b>dome-shaped</b> design by Lurzadeh with a modern cubical design.|$|E
25|$|B.subg. Banksia can {{be traced}} back to Banksia verae, an unranked taxon {{published}} by Robert Brown in his 1810 Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. Under Brown's arrangement, Banksia was divided into two groups based on inflorescence shape. Banksia verae was defined as containing those Banksia taxa with the elongate flower spike typical of Banksia, and it thus contained all but one species. The remaining species, B.ilicifolia (Holly-leaved Banksia), has a <b>dome-shaped</b> head and so was placed alone in Isostylis.|$|E
25|$|Flowers {{occur in}} the <b>dome-shaped</b> head {{characteristic}} of B.ser. Dryandra. These occur {{at the end of}} branches, either alone or in clusters, and are subtended by leaves. They are orange-yellow in colour, and up to three centimetres in diameter. Each head contain from 50 to 70 flowers, arranged in a ring about a central hollow, in the manner normally associated with members of the former series Dryandra ser. Niveae. This is surrounded by a great many involucral bracts that are narrow and taper to a long point.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Greek, ancient Roman {{and medieval}} {{philosophers}} usually combined the geocentric {{model with a}} spherical Earth. It {{is not the same}} as the older flat Earth model implied in some mythology. The ancient Jewish Babylonian uranography pictured a flat Earth with a <b>dome-shaped,</b> rigid canopy called the firmament placed over it (רקיע- rāqîa'). However, the ancient Greeks believed that the motions of the planets were circular and not elliptical, a view that was not challenged in Western culture until the 17th century through the synthesis of theories by Copernicus and Kepler.|$|E
25|$|B.subg. Isostylis {{shares with}} B.ser. Dryandra the {{property}} of having compact, <b>dome-shaped</b> flower heads. Structurally, however, Isostylis flower heads are quite {{different from those of}} B.ser. Dryandra, having more in common with the erect flower spikes of other Banksia taxa. Specifically, Isostylis flower heads have an ovoid axis, suggestive of a greatly reduced flower spike, whereas Dryandra flower heads emerge from a flat receptable. Furthermore, Isostylis has thick follicles with a woolly coating, whereas Dryandra follicles are thin and hairless; and the involucral, common and floral bracts of Isostylis are unlike those of Dryandra.|$|E
25|$|B.subg. Isostylis {{was first}} {{published}} by Robert Brown in his 1810 Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen; thus its full name, with author citation, is Banksia subg. Isostylis R.Br. Brown's arrangement was the first infrageneric arrangement of Banksia, making B.subg.Isostylis Banksias first infrageneric taxon. Brown erected B.subg. Isostylis to contain B.ilicifolia, which was then the only known Banksia with a <b>dome-shaped</b> inflorescence. He did not explicitly name a type species for the subgenus, but B.ilicifolia is treated as the type {{because it was the}} only member when the subgenus was published.|$|E
