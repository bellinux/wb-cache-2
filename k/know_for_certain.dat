5|$|Babakotia radofilai and {{all other}} sloth lemurs share many traits with living sloths, demonstrating {{convergent}} evolution. It had long forearms, curved digits, and highly mobile hip and ankle joints. Its skull was more heavily built than that of indriids, {{but not as much}} as in the larger sloth lemurs. Its dentition is similar to that of all other indriids and sloth lemurs. It lived in the northern part of Madagascar and shared its range with at least two other sloth lemur species, Palaeopropithecus ingens and Mesopropithecus dolichobrachion. Babakotia radofilai was primarily a leaf-eater (folivore), though it also ate fruit and hard seeds. It is known only from subfossil remains and may have died out shortly after the arrival of humans on the island, but not enough radiocarbon dating has been done with this species to <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>certain.</b>|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{existing}} procedures, {{he ordered the}} instrumentation system, which included telemetry, visibility, and the transmitters for communications, to be turned on last, just before reentry, rather than first. The call was a calculated risk. Without the instrumentation system, the crew and controllers would not <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>certain</b> if the cold startup had been successful until the last possible moment before reentry. However without the change, the capsule would have exhausted its battery supply before splashdown. The procedure was a success, and the crew was recovered safely.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{debate on}} this issue is still fresh; neither side can claim to <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>certain</b> which {{strategies}} will ultimately be effective in defeating non-state combatants. Opponents of the invasion strategy point {{to a lack of}} examples in which occupying or peacekeeping forces have met with conclusive success. They also cite continuing conflicts such as Northern Ireland, Israel, Chechnya, and Iraq, as well as examples which they claim ultimately proved to be failures, such as Lebanon, and Afghanistan. Supporters of the invasion strategy hold that {{it is too soon to}} call those situations failures, and that patience is needed to see the plan through. Some say that the invasions themselves have, in fact, been successful, but that political opponents and the international media skew the facts for sensationalism or political gain.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, {{because of}} the {{prediction}} and discovery of pulsars, the Crab Nebula again became a major centre of interest. It was then that Franco Pacini predicted {{the existence of the}} Crab Pulsar for the first time, which would explain the brightness of the cloud. The star was observed shortly afterwards in 1968. The discovery of the Crab pulsar, and the knowledge of its exact age (almost to the day) allows for the verification of basic physical properties of these objects, such as characteristic age and spin-down luminosity, the orders of magnitude involved (notably the strength of the magnetic field), along with various aspects related to the dynamics of the remnant. The role of this supernova to the scientific understanding of supernova remnants was crucial, as no other historical supernova created a pulsar whose precise age we can <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>certain.</b> The only possible exception to this rule would be SN1181 whose supposed remnant, 3C 58, is home to a pulsar, but its identification using Chinese observations from 1181 is sometimes contested.|$|E
500|$|Barrymore {{may have}} {{appeared}} in his first films in 1912. In four short films, a cast member is listed as [...] "Jack Barrymore"; this is probably John Barrymore, although Norden notes that [...] "we may never <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>certain</b> if [...] are in fact Barrymore movies." [...] The four films were Dream of a Motion Picture Director, The Widow Casey's Return, A Prize Package (all 1912) and One on Romance (1913). The films were produced by the Philadelphia-based Lubin Manufacturing Company and were lost in an explosion and fire at the Lubin vaults in 1914.|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of March 22, 1969, Abebe lost control of his Volkswagen Beetle; it overturned, {{trapping}} him inside. According to biographer Tim Judah, {{he may have been}} drinking. Judah quotes Abebe's account of the accident from the biography by his daughter, Tsige Abebe, that he tried [...] "to avoid a fast, oncoming car". Judah wrote that it was difficult to <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>certain</b> what happened. Abebe was freed from his car the following morning and brought to the Imperial Guard hospital. The accident left him a quadriplegic, paralysed from the neck down; he never walked again. On March 29 Abebe was transferred to Stoke Mandeville Hospital in England, where he spent eight months receiving treatment. He was visited by Queen Elizabeth II and received get-well cards from all over the world. Although Abebe could not move his head at first, his condition eventually improved to paraplegia, regaining the use of his arms.|$|E

500|$|Some of Shakespeare's plays were {{published}} in quarto editions, beginning in 1594, and by 1598, his name had become a selling point and began {{to appear on the}} title pages. Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson's Works names him on the cast lists for Every Man in His Humour (1598) and Sejanus His Fall (1603). The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson's Volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end. The First Folio of 1623, however, lists Shakespeare as one of [...] "the Principal Actors in all these Plays", some of which were first staged after Volpone, although we cannot <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>certain</b> which roles he played. In 1610, John Davies of Hereford wrote that [...] "good Will" [...] played [...] "kingly" [...] roles. In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet's father. Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in As You Like It, and the Chorus in Henry V, though scholars doubt the sources of that information.|$|E
500|$|On his {{spectrum}} of theistic probability, which has seven levels between 1 (100% {{belief in a}} God) and 7 (100% belief that gods do not exist), Dawkins has said he's a 6.9, which represents a [...] "de facto atheist" [...] who thinks [...] "I cannot <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>certain</b> but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life {{on the assumption that}} he is not there." [...] When asked about his slight uncertainty, Dawkins quips, [...] "I am agnostic to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies {{at the bottom of the}} garden." [...] In May 2014, at the Hay Festival in Wales, Dawkins explained that while he does not believe in the supernatural elements of the Christian faith, he still has nostalgia for the ceremonial side of religion. In addition to beliefs in deities, Dawkins has criticized other irrational religious beliefs such as Jesus turned water into wine, that an embryo starts as a blob, that magic underwear will protect you, that Jesus was resurrected, that semen comes from the spine, that Jesus walked on water, that the sun sets in a marsh, that the Garden of Eden existed in Missouri, that Jesus' mother was a virgin, that Muhammad split the moon, and that Lazarus was raised from the dead.|$|E

[...] In early 2006 Black Wolf Records released Live at Club Passim, a recording compiled from Paul's 2005 New Year's Eve shows. [...] In May 2006, Paul toured Europe and England playing to sold-out shows in Paris, France; Twickenham, England; Cheltenham, England and Wasserburg, Germany. [...] The tour also included two BBC radio interviews and a radio interview in Paris. [...] Paul was included on the Woody Guthrie Coalition's DVD Woody Sez: a Tribute to Woody Guthrie released in 2006. [...] The tribute show, recorded July 13, 2005 at the Crystal Theater in Okemah, Oklahoma, included Paul performing a duet with The Burns Sisters on [...] "God's Promise".

500|$|According to the 25th Infantry Division's Tropic Lightning Museum, 14 {{different}} American {{pilots were}} able to take off during the surprise attack and record 10 Japanese aircraft kills. Air Corps records credit Welch with four kills and Taylor with two, yet new research of Japanese combat reports confirms Taylor got four kills (when the two probable kills are included). Taylor claimed in an interview: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>certain</b> I shot down two planes or perhaps more; I don't know." [...] On the 13th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, the United States Air Force stated that they could not determine which of the two pilots shot down the first Japanese bomber: [...] "Each of them in his first attack shot down an enemy bomber, so the difference in time would have been but a few seconds in any case." [...] While in the air during the dogfight, the two pilots agreed that whoever survived the battle would claim credit to the title for the first kill. However, both pilots survived and because Welch outranked Taylor (he was a 41A, Taylor a 41C) and was the lead aircraft in the fight, he was credited with the first kill. The efforts of the two pilots’ dogfights {{were able to}} divert the Japanese from destroying the Haleiwa air field, which the Japanese intelligence did not know about prior to the attack. Taylor later reacted to the attack, saying [...] "I believed I was a better-trained pilot than the enemy. I had good equipment, and I was proud of it." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the three}} summer interns prepare to depart, Michael (Steve Carell) hears from {{various members of}} the office that two of the interns might be dating, and feels upset that he was left out of the gossip. He talks about the {{situation}} with the third intern, and learns that the interns had recently gone out to a young people's club, where they saw Stanley (Leslie David Baker) dancing with a woman, presumably his wife Teri. Michael, wanting to start some gossip of his own, forms the conclusion that Stanley was out because he was having a mid-life crisis and shares it with the office, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) claims Stanley does not like crowds and that Teri is out of town. When Michael confronts the interns about this, they insist they saw Stanley there [...] "making out" [...] with a woman. Now realizing that Stanley is possibly having an affair and he is the first person to learn of it, Michael starts telling the employees. Jim (John Krasinski) urges Michael to stop spreading a rumor that he does not <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>certain</b> to be true. When Stanley is leaving, Michael heads to the parking lot to discuss the rumor with him. Stanley initially denies it, but when Michael mentions that he was spotted in the club by the interns, he reveals that since Teri has been out of town constantly, he has been seeking company from a nurse named Cynthia, whom he met in rehab. Stanley urges Michael not to say anything since he is breaking it off with Cynthia, and Michael agrees, despite having already told the entire office.|$|E
