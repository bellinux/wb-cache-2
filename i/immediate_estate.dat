There was no residence on the <b>immediate</b> <b>estate,</b> and it was altogether divided from {{the remainder of the}} Greshamsbury property. This, with many inward and outward groans, Mr Gresham permitted to be sold.|$|E

It could be that this family’s noble seat was at the castle, the Horner Burg. The complex’s {{remnants}} can be found west of the village. In shape it was a special form of motte-and-bailey. In 1567, Johann von Koppenstein sold Meinhard von Schöneberg the remnants.|$|E

5000|$|The title [...] (female form , female plural [...] ) is {{used for}} the heads of princely houses of German origin (in German a [...] ). From the Late Middle Ages, it {{referred}} to any vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor ruling over an <b>immediate</b> <b>estate.</b> Unless he also holds a higher title, such as grand duke or king, he will be known either by the formula [...] " [...] + origin of the dynasty", or by the formula [...] " [...] + of the ruled territory".

50|$|During the 18th century, {{some of the}} <b>immediate</b> <b>estate</b> {{surrounding}} Hendon Place was {{auctioned off}} for large houses, {{with much of the}} land being used for building other mansions. Of these, Hendon Hall (now a hotel owned by Hand Picked Hotels), built in 1756 at the corner of Ashley Lane, is the last remaining and perhaps the best known. The suggestion that David Garrick, the actor, lived here while he was Lord of the Manor (1765-79) is without foundation. A small obelisk in the hotel garden dedicated to William Shakespeare and David Garrick originally stood in Manor Hall Road until 1957. A ceiling painting by Tiepolo, Olympia and the Four Continents, was uncovered in 1954 http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,860669,00.html, now in the Met http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/allegory_of_the_planets_and_continents_giovanni_battista_tiepolo/objectview.aspx?collID=11&OID=110002243; but two other large ceiling paintings are still in the house.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} two questions. The first asked how university students ranked four attributes of life insurance. These attributes were price, price information, estate creation, {{and rate of}} return. The second question asked if the way students viewed their {{control over their lives}} affected how they ranked these attributes. ^ The first question was intended to evaluate the relative value placed upon the attributes selected, at various levels. This came about from the idea that life insurance has value beyond that of the expected returns. It was reasoned that if the product has value, that value must be the sum of values assigned its components or attributes. Value was equated with preference, and a technique for measuring preference, conjoint measurement, was selected for data analysis. ^ The second question was predicated upon two factors. First, it seemed intuitively correct that individuals who thought they controlled their own lives would have different preferences for life insurance attributes than individuals who thought luck or chance controlled their lives. Second, previous research by Berekson and Grossbart 1974 had found locus of control to influence the amount of life insurance purchased. ^ While considering attributes of life insurance the students sampled within this research: (1) Indicated no difference in preferences for life insurance attributes by locus of control. (2) Indicated a preference for <b>immediate</b> <b>estate</b> creation over deferred estate creation. (3) Indicated a preference for higher rates of return over lower rates of return within a policy, up to a point, then preferred lower rates of return over higher rates. (4) Indicated a preference for lower policy prices over higher policy prices, but seemed indifferent to price over a broad middle range. (5) Indicated a preference for more information over less regarding the price of a policy, but not consistently so. Also: (6) No optimal combination of preferred life insurance attributes could be adequately determined. ...|$|E
5000|$|The Philippine Sakdalista {{movement}} {{was founded by}} the writer Benigno Ramos in 1930. The name of the movement {{is derived from the}} Tagalog word [...] "Sakdal", which means, [...] "to accuse". The movement’s platform was centered upon <b>immediate</b> independence, <b>estate</b> redistribution, taxation reductions, and greater governmental transparency. The movement lasted until 1935, when the Sakdalista leaders organized an active uprising that quickly failed, causing the party to dissolve. The movement is estimated to have had 20,000 formal members that influenced hundreds of thousands of Filipinos in the early 1930s.|$|R
50|$|The Lords of Myllendonk {{are first}} {{mentioned}} in 1166 {{as belonging to}} one of the most important lines in the Lower Rhine. The Dukes of Guelders gained overlordship of the territory in 1268, and overlordship passed to the Archbishopric of Cologne in 1279. The line was annexed to the Pesch Myllendonk family in 1263, and in c. 1350 passed to the House of Mirlaer which renamed itself to Myllendonk-Mirlaer. Myllendonk was eventually inherited by Johann Jakob, Count of Bronckhorst and Anholt, the Dukes of Croÿ in 1682, the Countess of Berlepsch in 1694, and through the female inheritance to the Counts of Ostein in 1700. Myllendonk was also raised to the Bench of Counts of Westphalia in 1700 as an <b>immediate</b> Imperial <b>Estate.</b>|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} his authority as imperial preceptor was recognized in Tibet. This {{is seen by}} a set of religious rules that he issued in the great temple of Dadu in May 1336. A document preserved in the Zhalu Monastery in 1348 shows that he still had a say in Tibetan affairs at that time. His position was also strengthened by the appointment of his son Lotro Gyaltsen as abbot-ruler of Sakya in 1347. As common in the Khon family, he married and sired children before his full ordination as monk. However, he stayed in Dadu until his death in 1358 and was unable to interfere directly in the civil war that emerged from 1346. One of the 13 myriarchies of Central Tibet, Phagmodru, was headed by the strong-willed and ambitious Changchub Gyaltsen who involved in a complicated series of clashes with rival lords and the Sakya administrators (dpon-chen or ponchen). As Changchub Gyaltsen got the upper hand he managed to dominate Ü (East Central Tibet) by c. 1350. In 1354 he reduced the power of the Sakya elite to its <b>immediate</b> <b>estates</b> in Tsang (West Central Tibet). Kunga Gyaltsen's brother-in-law, the influential lama Kunpangpa, was murdered in 1357 and in the next year Changchub Gyaltsen arranged a conference in Sakya which confirmed the transfer of power over Central Tibet to the new Phagmodrupa regime. Dissatisfied elements within Sakya were ruthlessly defeated. During all these events, Changchub Gyaltsen continued to formally adhere to the Yuan Dynasty and received the title Tai Situ from the great khan. When Kunga Gyaltsen died in Dadu in the same year, no successor was appointed for some years. His nephew Sonam Lotro Gyaltsen briefly served as such in 1361-1362, when the Yuan dynasty was in its death throes.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{the revolt}} instigated by the Wettin margrave Dedi I in 1069, Emperor Henry IV {{appointed}} the loyal House of Mansfeld counts (Grafen) in the Saxon Hassegau at Eisleben. The family progenitor, Count Hoyer I of Mansfeld, {{also known as}} Hoyer the Great, was a field marshal {{in the service of}} Emperor Henry V. He was killed at the Battle of Welfesholz on 11 February 1115, fighting the rebellious Saxon forces under Count Lothair of Supplinburg. The Mansfelds held extended fiefs both in the Archbishopric of Magdeburg and the Bishopric of Halberstadt. The male line became extinct for the first time upon the death of Count Burchard of Mansfeld in 1229; his daughter Sophia married a scion of the Lords of Querfurt, who assumed the comital title. In the 15th century, the primary house divided into cadet branches: Hinterort, Mittelort, and Vorderort, while their County of Mansfeld in 1512 joined the Upper Saxon Circle as an <b>immediate</b> Imperial <b>estate.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{shores of}} Ruppiner See were settled since the Stone Age; in the 9th century AD, Poggenwerder Island {{was the site}} of a Slavic gord (burgwall), {{probably}} built by Polabian Zamizi tribes. The castle was possibly slighted during the Wendish Crusade of 1147 and about 1200 a lowland castle was erected on an opposite peninsula, which from 1214 served as the residence of the Lords of Ruppin. Their lordship remained an <b>immediate</b> Imperial <b>estate</b> until its final incorporation into the neighbouring Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1524. The name Neuruppin means [...] "New Ruppin", as the original settlement of Ruppin (later Alt Ruppin, [...] "Old Ruppin") was located around the castle on the north-eastern shore of the Ruppiner See. In the early 13th century, when the settlement became too small for the growing population, Neuruppin on the western shore of the lake was established by the Lords of Lindow-Ruppin. First mentioned in a 1238 deed, it became the first establishment of the Dominican Order between the Elbe and Oder rivers, when the local noble Wichmann von Arnstein founded Neuruppin Abbey in 1246. Today only the monastery church is still standing. Since the Protestant Reformation it is called St Trinitatis. Neuruppin received town privileges on 9 March 1256; town walls were erected and completed until the 15th century.|$|R
25|$|In 313 Constantine I {{declared}} official toleration of Christianity, followed {{over the}} ensuing decades by establishment of Christian orthodoxy and by official and private action against pagans and non-orthodox Christians. His successors generally continued this process, and Christianity became {{the religion of}} any ambitious civil official. Under Constantine the cities lost their revenue from local taxes, and under Constantius II (r. 337–361) their endowments of property. This worsened the existing difficulty in keeping the city councils up to strength, and the services provided by the cities were scamped or abandoned. Public building projects became fewer, more often repairs than new construction, and now provided at state expense rather than by local grandees wishing to consolidate long-term local influence. A further financial abuse was Constantius's increased habit of granting to his <b>immediate</b> entourage the <b>estates</b> of persons condemned of treason and other capital charges; this reduced future though not immediate income, and those close to the emperor gained a strong incentive to stimulate his suspicion of plots.|$|R
