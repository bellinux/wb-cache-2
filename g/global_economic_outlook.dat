It is simply not possible to examine future oil market trends in the EU without taking into account global supply and demand, which will determine future oil prices. Similar considerations apply in the case of natural gas.

40|$|Excerpt] While Asia {{remains a}} key driver of <b>global</b> <b>economic</b> growth, the <b>outlook</b> {{for the region}} anticipates slow {{marginal}} growth for 2015 before rebounding in 2016 and remaining stronger for the next 2 years. India’s growth and the increased demand from the United States of America (US) will offset slower growth in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Downside risks may impact the regional <b>economic</b> <b>outlook.</b> First, the anticipated rise in US interest rates, while indicative of a continued recovery in the global economy, will hit the region {{during a time when}} growth remains tempered. The Eurozone recovery is still constrained by the debt crisis, which has global implications. Ongoing fears about the stability of PRC’s financial markets may also have an impact. Fears of instability remain in Asia’s domestic financial markets despite the capital inflows that have underpinned the rapid economic growth in the region. The recent global and domestic shocks, along with the “taper tantrum” in the spring of 2013, the continuing decline in global oil prices, and PRC’s adjustments to its monetary and financial policies, have contributed to volatility in regional financial markets. Looking at longer-term trends, rapidly aging Asian populations and socio-cultural changes in the informal, family-based, old-age support mechanisms have created a rising demand for income and support services for the elderly and the poor. Therefore, governments and their populations are rightfully concerned about the long-term sustainability of their social security and fiscal health. Public pension systems must find ways to cope with these pressures while many already struggle with structural challenges such as early retirement ages, diverging replacement rates under different systems, liberal withdrawal policies, and limited coverage. These factors are further exacerbated by restrictive investment mandates, which significantly curtail the ability of many developing pension systems to seek higher returns through a more diversified investment portfolio...|$|R

50|$|Unlike other {{emerging}} economies, China {{has so far}} {{chose to}} continue holding its currency down against the dollar, fighting inflation instead with interest rate rises. The rate rises cause even greater pressure from the markets for a currency appreciation, and to prevent this, {{at least in the}} months leading up to early 2011, China had to buy dollar assets at a faster rate than ever.In May, Alan Beatie for the Financial Times suggested that the Currency War was not over, it had merely entered a lull, with the underlying tensions still unresolved.In July 2011, Guido Mantega told the Financial Times that the struggle between China and the US was still ongoing, suggesting that several emerging economies including Brazil were still experiencing undesirable upwards pressure on their exchange rates.As investor confidence in the <b>global</b> <b>economic</b> <b>outlook</b> fell in early August, Bloomberg suggested the currency war had entered a new phase.

50|$|The U.S. {{financial}} system was once closed, but the United States soon {{changed into a}} part of the interconnected global network. The international migration of saving funds redefined the <b>global</b> <b>economic</b> <b>outlook</b> and reshaped the structure.Since the 1980s, the international {{financial system}} has developed a new set of risk management techniques and new advanced financial instruments, and these efforts have led to various ways of success. Among them, asset securitization has been a great source of funding for the global financial revolution, which can significantly reduce the scope of global investment and split the stakes into a wide range of revenue sources. But the financial process of asset itself had a new problem. Asset securitization has allowed widespread funding to induce widespread changes in the economy, allowing widespread financing to take place, but it has spread to a huge problem if it suffers from itself. Asset securitization provided another major vulnerability to today's financial systems. The banks that lend loans do not cling to the danger of borrowers taking loans. The lender no longer needs to cling to compensate for its efforts to avoid danger in any case, as it is divided into the risk of loan. However, it is not only possible to talk about asset securitization as in black and white. If we ban asset securitization, the overall lending of the U.S. and the China will severely decline and the economy will shrink greatly.Since 1980, there has been a significant increase in global capital.Therefore, foreign investment in the United States has been increased. And it was good for U.S. The notion that the U.S. economy depends on foreign capital may sound dangerous. But the situation is not that serious. The savings fund is still based on the U.S. dollar, as its size is so large that only two kinds of the assets denominated in dollar and Euro assets are properly invested to cover the large amounts of capital. What European policymakers do not want to face the world's excessive saving funds is flowing in to Europe and it makes Euro more valuable. Because it means that Europe's product lower position in the world's market. The dollar is still an essential commodity for the commodity, currency, and derivatives of the world. The value of the dollar, which reflects inflation, is too high compared to other Asian currencies. It is necessary to implement coordinated efforts to resolve the exchange rate gap. But if the U.S. financial system fails to restore trust or if the Federal fails to respond to inflation expectations, the debate will end and the dollar will fall into turmoil.The Asian central bank will not deliberately carry out anything that could undermine the dollar as well as the sale of U.S. treasuries. That is because they are degrading the entire value of the enormous dollar they hold.The United States should maintain its position as an attractive target for investment, and its fiscal imbalances should be resolved quickly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Forecasts of the {{quarterly}} real {{price of oil}} are routinely used by international organizations and central banks worldwide in assessing the <b>global</b> and domestic <b>economic</b> <b>outlook,</b> yet {{little is known about}} how best to generate such forecasts. Our analysis breaks new ground in several dimensions. First, we address a number of econometric and data issues specific to real-time forecasts of quarterly oil prices. Second, we develop real-time forecasting models not only for U. S. benchmarks such as WTI crude oil, but we also develop forecasting models for the price of Brent crude oil, which has become increasingly accepted as the best measure of the global price of oil in recent years. Third, we design for the first time methods for forecasting the real price of oil in foreign consumption units rather than U. S. consumption units, taking {{the point of view of}} forecasters outside the U. S. In addition, we investigate the costs and benefits of allowing for time variation in vector autoregressive (VAR) model parameters and of constructing forecast combinations. We conclude that quarterly forecasts of the real price of oil from suitably designed VAR models estimated on monthly data generate the most accurate forecasts overall among a wide range of methods including forecasts based on oil futures prices, no-change forecasts and forecasts based on regression models estimated on quarterly data...|$|R
