40|$|Abstract: Adhesively bonded {{insulated}} rail joints {{are used to}} electrically isolate sections of track into discrete blocks to detect the positions of trains, and are sometimes useful in detecting rail breaks. Recent advances in high-strength rails allow {{for the use of}} higher-weight cars. With this increased axle loading of the freight lines, bonded rail joints are encountering early breakdown through either electrical or mechanical failure. Service lives as short as 12 – 18 months have been reported on some rail lines, significantly lower than the lifetime of other railway components. The cost of replacing the joints has significantly increased the desire for a joint with improved durability. Commercially available bonded rail joints are typically double butt-strap joints consisting of two steel reinforcing <b>joint</b> <b>bars,</b> bonded to the rails with an epoxy adhesive that may contain a fibreglass or aramid cloth layer. This paper investigates a tapered bonded joint that was proposed to reduce the high stresses that can result in the more typical butt-strap joint configuration. The first type of analysis models the rails and <b>joint</b> <b>bars</b> as beams, and the adhesive and ground as distributed elastic springs. Approximate solutions are obtained {{with the use of the}} Rayleigh–Ritz method. The finite-element method is used in the second type of analysis. Deflections, bending moments, andstresses areobtained. Basedon theseanalyses, tapered insulated joints shouldpro-vide some advantages over conventional {{insulated rail}} joints, such as lower deflections, bending moments, and shear stresses in the adhesive...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{lifetime}} of an insulated railroad joint in the field has decreased due to increasing wheel loads. The goal {{of this research is}} to investigate possible changes in insulated rail joint design in order to improve the performance of the insulated joint. The finite element program ABAQUS is used to model the supported butt joint. In this model, the rail, joint bars, epoxy, and ties surrounding the joint are modeled using solid elements. The remaining ties are modeled as an elastic foundation. The rail is subjected to a tensile load, as well as a vertical wheel load that is applied to the rail using Hertz contact theory. Parametric studies are performed by varying the tie width, <b>joint</b> <b>bar</b> length, and <b>joint</b> <b>bar</b> dimensions. Two different wheel load locations are also investigated: centered about the end post, and halfway between the tie under the end post and the tie just {{to the left of the}} end post. The vertical displacement of the rail and insulated joint is one measure used to determine the effect of the parameters on the insulated joint. However, since the most common cause of failure in insulated rail joints is the debonding of the epoxy, this research also focuses on the stresses present in the epoxy when the joint is subjected to a static wheel load.

40|$|Proper {{functioning}} of Insulated Rail Joints (IRJs) {{is essential for}} the safe operation of the railway signalling systems and broken rail identification circuitries. The Conventional IRJ (CIRJ) resembles structural butt joints consisting of two pieces of rails connected together through two joint bars on either side of their web and the assembly is held together through pre-tensioned bolts. As the IRJs should maintain electrical insulation between the two rails, a gap between the rail ends must be retained at all times and all metal contacting surfaces should be electrically isolated from each other using non-conductive material. At the gap, the rail ends lose longitudinal continuity and hence the vertical sections of the rail ends are often severely damaged, especially at the railhead, due to the passage of wheels compared to other continuously welded rail sections. Fundamentally, the reason for the severe damage can be related to the singularities of the wheel-rail contact pressure and the railhead stress. No new generation designs that have emerged in the market to date have focussed on this fundamental; they only have provided attention to either the higher strength materials or the thickness of the sections of various components of the IRJs. In this thesis a novel method of shape optimisation of the railhead is developed to eliminate the pressure and stress singularities through changes to the original sharp corner shaped railhead into an arc profile in the longitudinal direction. The optimal shape of the longitudinal railhead profile has been determined using three nongradient methods in search of accuracy and efficiency: (1) Grid Search Method; (2) Genetic Algorithm Method and (3) Hybrid Genetic Algorithm Method. All these methods have been coupled with a parametric finite element formulation for the evaluation of the objective function for each iteration or generation depending on the search algorithm employed. The optimal shape derived from these optimisation methods is termed as Stress Minimised Railhead (SMRH) in this thesis. This optimal SMRH design has exhibited significantly reduced stress concentration that remains well below the yield strength of the head hardened rail steels and has shifted the stress concentration location away from the critical zone of the railhead end. The reduction in the magnitude and the relocation of the stress concentration in the SMRH design has been validated through a full scale wheel – railhead interaction test rig; Railhead strains under the loaded wheels have been recorded using a non-contact digital image correlation method. Experimental study has confirmed the accuracy of the numerical predications. Although the SMRH shaped IRJs eliminate stress singularities, they can still fail due to <b>joint</b> <b>bar</b> or bolt hole cracking; therefore, another conceptual design, termed as Embedded IRJ (EIRJ) in this thesis, with no joint bars and pre-tensioned bolts has been developed using a multi-objective optimisation formulation based on the coupled genetic algorithm – parametric finite element method. To achieve the required structural stiffness for the safe passage of the loaded wheels, the rails were embedded into the concrete of the post tensioned sleepers; the optimal solutions for the design of the EIRJ is shown to simplify the design through the elimination of the complex interactions and failure modes of the various structural components of the CIRJ. The practical applicability of the optimal shapes SMRH and EIRJ is demonstrated through two illustrative examples, termed as improved designs (IMD 1 & IMD 2) in this thesis; IMD 1 is a combination of the CIRJ and the SMRH designs, whilst IMD 2 is a combination of the EIRJ and SMRH designs. These two improved designs have been simulated for two key operating (speed and wagon load) and design (wheel diameter) parameters that affect the wheel-rail contact; the effect of these parameters {{has been found to be}} negligible to the performance of the two improved designs and the improved designs are in turn found far superior to the current designs of the CIRJs in terms of stress singularities and deformation under the passage of the loaded wheels. Therefore, these improved designs are expected to provide longer service life in relation to the CIRJs...|$|E
40|$|Butt joints {{are used}} widely in bridge girders, and rails when simple or moment {{resistant}} connections are required between steel members. The butt joints are some times applied to accommodate thermal movement in rails and bridge girders. Those types of joints {{are not considered}} in this paper. The structural behaviour of the butt joints has a significant influence over the structural integrity. Ju et al [1] carried out a detailed 3 D finite element analysis of bolted steel joints {{with a view to}} investigating the applicability of linear elastic fracture mechanics to such joints under loading that cause plastic deformation. Lazzarin et al [2] carried out a large number of experiments on bolted aluminium joints with a view to examining the effect of the geometry and environmental factors on the fatigue behaviour and failure mode. They concluded that the fatigue behaviour of the bolted aluminium joints was closely aligned to the behaviour of welded aluminium structures. Typically in most structural connections, the main structural plate is thicker than the cover plates that cover the dry butt joint [3, 4, 5]. However, in rail joints, in particular where rails are joined to achieve electrical insulation (achieved by the insertion of electrical insulating material between the rails), the rail web is thinner than the cover plates (known as 'joint bars'). The importance of the integrity of this type of joint may be visualised from the role they play in signalling and train location systems that are vital in the safety of railway operation. As the joint consists of insulating materials whose properties under service conditions (confinement, thermal loads and impacts) are not known and uses glue of highly nonlinear properties, {{it is very difficult to}} examine the structural integrity of the rail joint in its "as-designed" condition. Furthermore, there is very little work reported on rail joints although such joints significantly affect ride quality, increase dynamic/impact loading and deteriorate the rail surface with the continuous passage of wheel loading [6]. As rail joint is a complex problem, detailed analysis of various parts of the body constituting the rail joint is necessary. Therefore, simplification has been made in the analysis of glued insulated rail joint by breaking the complex problem into a number of simple problems. This paper describes one of the simple idealisations of the rail joint problem. A three-dimensional finite element model was employed to simulate and investigate the structural behaviour of the butt joint subjected to biaxial stress field generated by inplane flexure. Elasto-plastic material model was used for the main plates whilst all other components were assumed to remain elastic throughout the loading history. A two-step non-linear analysis was performed. In the first step, the bolts were pre-stressed with a pre-defined level of tension, which were allowed to relax a portion of the tensile strain due to the deformability of the underlying joint-bars and the structural plates. On attaining equilibrium, the assembly was subjected to in-plane bending that generated biaxial stress fields as the second step. As glue is used between the plates and <b>joint</b> <b>bars</b> in the rail insulation connection, tie constraints were considered and applied on contact surfaces between the plates and <b>joint</b> <b>bars</b> in the simulations.
