40|$|We {{report the}} {{partitioning}} of the interaction-induced static electronic dipole (hyper) polarizabilities for linear hydrogen cyanide complexes into contributions arising from various interaction energy terms. We analyzed the nonadditivities of the studied properties and used these data {{to predict the}} electric properties of an infinite chain. The interaction-induced static electric dipole properties and their nonadditivities were analyzed using an approach based on numerical differentiation of the interaction energy components estimated in an external electric field. These were obtained using the hybrid variational-perturbational interaction energy decomposition scheme, augmented with coupled-cluster calculations, with singles, doubles, and noniterative triples. Our {{results indicate that the}} interaction-induced dipole moments and polarizabilities are primarily electrostatic in nature; however, the composition of the interaction hyperpolarizabilities is much more complex. The overlap effects substantially quench the contributions due to electrostatic interactions, and therefore, the major components are due to the induction and exchange induction terms, as well as the intramolecular electron-correlation corrections. A particularly intriguing observation is that the interaction first hyperpolarizability in the studied systems not only is much larger than the corresponding sum of monomer properties, but also has the opposite sign. We show that this effect {{can be viewed as a}} direct consequence of hydrogen-bonding interactions that lead to a decrease of the hyperpolarizability of the proton acceptor and an increase of the hyperpolarizability of the proton donor. In the case of the first hyperpolarizability, we also observed the largest nonadditivity of interaction properties (nearly 17 %) which further enhances the effects of pairwise interactions.

40|$|Background Economic {{crises and}} {{unemployment}} have {{profound impact on}} mental health and well-being. Main goal of the Healthy Employment (HE) project is to enhance intersectoral actions promoting mental health among unemployed, namely through the implementation and effectiveness-evaluation of short-term and sustainable group interventions. Methods The project follows a RE-AIM-based (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) framework for assessing a cognitive-behavioural and psychoeducational intervention that has been developed for promoting mental health among unemployed people. It is a short-term group intervention (five sessions, four hours each, 20 unemployed persons per group) focused on mental health literacy, interpersonal communication and of emotional regulation. Implementation of the intervention {{will be carried out}} by clinical psychologists, following a standardized procedure manual. Effectiveness will be assessed through a randomized field study with two arms (intervention and control). Participants are unemployed people (18 – 65 years old, both genders, having at least nine years of formal education) registered at public employment centres from different geographical regions for less than 12 months (including first-job seekers). Allocation to arms of the study will follow a random match-to-case process, considering gender, age groups and educational level. Three moments of evaluation will occur: before intervention (baseline), immediately after its ending and three months later. Main outcomes are mental health literacy, mental health related personal and perceived stigma, psychological well-being, satisfaction with life and resilience. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be conducted. Cohen’s d coefficient and odds ratio will be used for assessing the size of the intervention effect, when significant. Discussion Scientific and clinical knowledge will be applied to promote/protect psychological well-being of unemployed people. While the first phases of the project are funded by the European Economic Area Grants, long-term assessments of the intervention require a larger timeframe. Further funding and institutional support will be sought for this purpose. Already established intersectoral collaborations are key-assets to reach long-term sustainability of this project.

Ecosystem {{services}} (ES) mapping is attracting growing interest from landscape and urban planning, but its operationalization in actual decision-making is still limited. A {{clear distinction between}} ES capacity, flow and demand can improve the usefulness of ES mapping as a decision-support tool by informing planners and policy-makers where ES are used unsustainably and where ES flow is failing to meet societal demand. This paper advances a framework for mapping and assessing the relationships between ES capacity, flow and demand {{with a focus on}} the identification of unsatisfied demand. The framework was tested in the Barcelona metropolitan region, Spain, considering two ES of critical relevance for the urban population: air purification and outdoor recreation. For both ES, spatial indicators of capacity, flow, demand and unsatisfied demand were developed using proxy- and process-based models. The results show a consistent spatial pattern of all these components along the urban-rural gradient for the two ES assessed. The flow of both ES mainly takes place in the periurban green areas whereas the highest capacity values are mostly found in the protected areas located {{on the outskirts of the}} metropolitan region. As expected, ES demand and particularly unsatisfied demand are mostly situated in the main urban core (i. e., Barcelona and adjacent cities). Our assessment also reveals that the current landscape planning instrument for the metropolitan region mostly protects areas with high capacity to provide ES, but might lead to declining ES flows in periurban areas due to future urban developments. We contend that the mapping of ES capacity, flow and demand can contribute to the successful integration of the ES approach in landscape and urban planning because it provides a comprehensive picture of the ES delivery process, considering both ecological and social underlying factors. However, we identify three main issues that should be better addressed in future research: (1) improvement of ES demand indicators using participatory methods; (2) integration of ecological thresholds into the analysis; and (3) use of a multi-scale approach that covers both the local and regional planning levels and cross-scale interactions between them...|$|R

Funding support is gratefully acknowledged. The paper investigates the spatial heterogeneity of public’s preferences for the implementation of a new country-wide forest management and protection program in Poland. Spatial econometric methods and high resolution geographical information system data related to forest characteristics are used to explain the variation in individual-specific willingness to pay (WTP) values, derived from a discrete choice experiment study. We find that respondents’ WTP is higher the closer they live to their nearest forest, and the scarcer forests are in the area where they live. Interestingly, the higher the ecological value of forests in respondents’ area, the more people prefer extending areas of national forest protection. We also investigate spatial patterns in individual-specific WTP scores and in latent class membership probabilities, finding that preferences are indeed spatially clustered. We argue that this clustering should be taken into account in forest management and policy-making. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A {{metabolomics}} {{approach was}} used to analyze effects of salmon farming on wild saithe (Pollachius virens) populations. Saithe fish were captured at two salmon farms and at two control locations around the island of Hitra, Norway. Changes in diet seem to drive changes in metabolic status of fishes. The liver and muscle tissues, from the fishes captured around the farm, showed higher levels of lactate and certain amino acids (glutamine, glutamate, and alanine) {{and lower levels of}} glucose and choline than the fishes captured in the control locations, far from the farm locations. The higher levels of lactate and amino acids could be related to the facility of obtaining food around the farm and the deficit in choline to the deficit of this nutrient in the salmon feed. At each location the fish were captured with either benthic gill nets and automatic jigging machines, and this feature showed also variations in different metabolites.

40|$|The {{attraction}} of wild fish to net cage fish farms due to uneaten fish feed pellets that have fallen through the cages as waste feed, {{is a global}} phenomenon (Uglem, Karlsen, Sanchez-Jerez, & Sæther, 2014). The amount of feed not eaten by the farmed fish can reach up to 5 % of the total amount in Norwegian salmon farming (Otterå, Karlsen, Slinde, & Olsen, 2009; Svåsand et al., 2015). This suggests that thousands of tonnes of waste feed are available to wild fish aggregating around these salmon farms. Farm-associated (FA) wild fish that have eaten a diet consisting partially of salmon feed are significantly fatter, with higher concentrations of terrestrial-derived fatty acids and lower concentrations of DHA in the muscle and liver than in unassociated (UA) fish (Dempster et al., 2011; Fernandez-Jover et al., 2011). Fish nutrition can influence {{the taste of the}} fish, either by variation in the biochemical composition of the tissues or by reducing the shelf life (Lie, 2001). Fishermen, fishmongers and consumers in Norway during the last couple of decades have reported that the taste of FA saithe (Pollachius virens) is inferior compared to UA fish (Uglem et al., 2014). The {{purpose of this study was}} to make taste comparisons of dishes made of either FA or UA saithe caught and processed using standardized means, by carrying out two simple consumer tests.

40|$|The common goby, Pomatoschistus microps, is a {{relevant}} species from estuarine food webs, playing important roles as predator of polychaetes and crustaceans and as prey for larger fishes and crustaceans. The Minho estuary (NW Portugal) {{is a relatively}} wellpreserved and productive system. To assess the population structure and production of P. microps in this estuary, monthly samples were undertaken in three different areas along an estuarine gradient in the lower estuary. The density of P. microps varied considerably among seasons and sampling stations, with higher densities occurring in summer and autumn. The lowest densities were found closer to the sea. In general, the density of females was higher than the density of males in all sampling stations, while juveniles were more abundant within a salt marsh area. Compared with other European estuaries, our data showed a remarkable higher density and production values of P. microps. This {{may be related to}} the high freshwater input and the low salinities found in this estuary. In addition, we hypothesize that the lower density of the sympatric species P. minutus and the high availability of bivalve shells observed in the Minho estuary may have also contributed to the present results, once P. minutus and P. microps often display a diet overlap and the bivalve shells are crucial for the common goby reproduction.

It has been exposed to relatively high levels of mortality associated with by-catch in some regions. Its late maturity and low fecundity potentially renders it vulnerable to over-exploitation, although little remains known about processes of connectivity between key habitats/regions. This study utilised DNA sequencing of partial regions of the mitochondrial control region and nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 to investigate population structure and phylogeography of this species across the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Basin. Despite the inclusion of samples from the range edges or remote locations, no evidence of significant population structure was detected. An important exception was identified using the control region sequence, with much greater (and statistically significant) levels of genetic differentiation between the Mediterranean and Atlantic. This suggests that the Strait of Gibraltar may represent an important bathymetric barrier, separating regions with very low levels of female dispersal. Bayesian estimation of divergence time also places the separation between the Mediterranean and Atlantic lineages within the last 100, 000 years, presumably connected with perturbations during the last Glacial Period. These results demonstrate population subdivision at a much smaller geographic distance than has generally been identified in previous work on deep-sea sharks. This highlights a very significant role for shallow bathymetry in promoting genetic differentiation in deepwater taxa. It acts as an important exception to a general paradigm of marine species being connected by high levels of gene-flow, representing single stocks over large scales. It may also have significant implications for the fisheries management of this species.
