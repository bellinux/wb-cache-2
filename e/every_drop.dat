5|$|Rarely, Banai {{also appears}} in Khandoba's chief legend where he slays the demons Mani and Malla. Mhalsa and Banai (or Ganga) futilely help Khandoba {{in the battle}} to collect the blood of Mani, <b>every</b> <b>drop</b> of which was {{creating}} a new demon. Finally, the dog of Khandoba swallows all the blood. Rarely, Banai is described as seated behind Khandoba on the horse and fighting with a sword or spear, a role generally assigned to Mhalsa.|$|E
5|$|Oral stories {{continue}} {{the process of}} Sanskritization of Khandoba— his elevation from a folk deity to Shiva, a deity of the classical Hindu pantheon— that was initiated by the texts. Khandoba's wives Mhalsa and Banai are also identified with Shiva's classical Hindu wives Parvati and Ganga. Hegadi Pradhan, the minister and brother-in-law of Khandoba and brother of Lingavat Vani Mhalsa, the faithful dog that helps Khandoba kill the demons, the horse given by Mani and the demon brothers are considered avatars of Vishnu, Krishna, Nandi and the demons Madhu-Kaitabha respectively. Other myth variants narrate that Khandoba defeats a single demon named Manimalla, who offers his white horse, sometimes called Mani, to the god. Other legends depict Mhalsa (or Parvati) and Banai or Banu (or Ganga) as futilely helping Khandoba in the battle to collect the blood of Mani, <b>every</b> <b>drop</b> of which was creating a new demon. Finally, the dog of Khandoba swallows all the blood. Sometimes, Mhalsa, or rarely Banai, is described as seated behind Khandoba on the horse and fighting with a sword or spear.|$|E
25|$|During {{a fierce}} battle {{in which the}} Great Goddess {{demonstrates}} her omnipotence by defeating powerful demons who terrify the devas, she encounters the fierce Raktabija (chapter 8). <b>Every</b> <b>drop</b> of blood Raktabija sheds transforms into another demon as it touches the earth. A unique strategy has to be devised to vanquish him. A fiery burst of energy emerging from Devi's third eye takes the dark skeletal form of goddess Kali. With her huge mouth and enormous tongue she ferociously laps up Raktabija's blood, thus preventing the uprising of further demons.|$|E

500|$|Her {{best known}} {{appearance}} on the battlefield is in the sixth century Devi Mahatmyam. The deity of {{the first chapter of}} Devi Mahatmyam is Mahakaali, who appears from the body of sleeping Vishnu as goddess Yoga Nidra to wake him up in order to protect Bramha and the World from two demons Madhu and Kaitabha. When Vishnu woke up he started a war against the two demons. After a long battle with Lord Vishnu when the two demons were undefeated Mahakaali took the form of Mahamaya to enchant the two asuras. When Madhu and Kaitabha were enchanted by Mahakaali, Vishnu killed them. In the later chapters the story of two demons can be found who were destroyed by Kaali. Chanda and Munda attack the goddess Durga. Durga responds with such anger that her face turns dark and Kaali appears out of her forehead. Kaali's appearance is black, gaunt with sunken eyes, and wearing a tiger skin and a garland of human heads. She immediately defeats the two demons. Later in the same battle, the demon Raktabija is undefeated because of his ability to reproduce himself from <b>every</b> <b>drop</b> of his blood that reaches the ground. Countless Raktabija clones appear on the battlefield. Kaali eventually defeats him by sucking his blood before it can reach the ground, and eating the numerous clones. Kinsley writes that Kaali represents [...] "Durga's personified wrath, her embodied fury." ...|$|E

Water was not a problem {{in the early part of}} the voyage due to frequent heavy rain. In May however, it became scarce and was reduced at one stage to 3 oz per man per day. Rations were supplemented by an occasional fish caught by the Malays using an improvised spear made from a pair of scissors lashed to a raft stanchion. Fishing lines in the rafts were useless as the hooks had been stolen. [...] In all 27 fish, along with two birds and one small turtle, were captured in this manner and eaten raw. However, there were long periods with no solid food - up to 10 days at one stage and nine days on another.
