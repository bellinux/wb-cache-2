It has a wingspan of approximately 32–36mm.|$|E

5|$|Another {{derivative}} genre termed machinima verite, from cinéma vérité, {{seeks to}} add a documentary and additional realism to the machinima piece. L.M.

Other element of cinéma vérité, such as longer takes, sweeping camera transitions, and jump cuts may be included to complete the effect.|$|E
5|$|Archpriests {{and priests}} {{would use a}} less ornate mantle in their arms, and an ecclesiastical hat of the style they wear liturgically. Although an Orthodox monk (not an abbot) <b>displaying</b> {{personal}} arms is rare, a hieromonk (monk who has been ordained a priest) would appropriately display a monastic hat (klobuk) and a black cloak or veil suggestive of his attire, and a hierodeacon (monastic deacon) would display an orarion behind the shield.|$|E
50|$|Lacking a {{measurement}} device, measurement {{can be performed}} using a test <b>display</b> (the <b>display</b> being measured), a control <b>display</b> (usually a CRT) that would ideally have negligible <b>display</b> lag, a computer capable of mirroring an output to the two <b>displays,</b> stopwatch software, and a high-speed camera pointed at the two <b>displays</b> running the stopwatch program. The lag time is measured by taking {{a photograph of the}} <b>displays</b> running the stopwatch software, then subtracting the two times on the <b>displays</b> in the photograph. This method only measures the difference in <b>display</b> lag between two <b>displays</b> and cannot determine the absolute <b>display</b> lag of a single <b>display.</b> CRTs are preferable to use as a control <b>display</b> because their <b>display</b> lag is typically negligible.

30|$|<b>Displays</b> {{with large}} screen size and high {{resolution}} are increasingly becoming affordable and ubiquitous. Large <b>displays</b> {{are often used}} in certain niche markets such as public <b>displays</b> and digital signage markets.

Also, in universities, research institutes, and corporations, large wall-sized <b>displays</b> are often built from small-sized individual <b>display</b> panels. Such large-sized tiled <b>displays</b> are used for scientific, medical visualization applications [1]. Examples of such tiled <b>displays</b> include LambdaVision <b>display</b> at University of Illinois at Chicago's Electronic Visualization Laboratory [2], Stallion tiled <b>display</b> at Texas Advanced Computing Center [3], and Stanford School of Medicine tiled <b>display</b> [4].

40|$|Objective: Effects of <b>display</b> {{size and}} dual <b>display</b> setting on {{preferred}} <b>display</b> and keyboard positions were evaluated. Background: User-preferred <b>display</b> position may vary as its size changes or when multiple <b>displays</b> are used. It {{is also not}} known whether the use of larger <b>displays</b> or multiple <b>displays</b> would influence positioning of the keyboard. Method: Participants (N = 19) who had normal visual acuity (20 / 30 or better) determined preferred positions of the <b>display</b> and the keyboard during a data entry task in four <b>display</b> setups (19, 24, 27. 5, and dual 19 in.). The size of capital characters (3. 2 mm high) was kept consistent between setups. Results: Preferred viewing distance ranged from 0. 68 m (19 -in. <b>display)</b> to 0. 76 m (27. 5 -in. <b>display).</b> No significant differences in viewing distance and <b>display</b> height {{were found between the}} single 19 -in. <b>display</b> and dual 19 -in. <b>displays</b> setups. The preferred position of the keyboard was consistent between <b>display</b> setups. Conclusion: Participants placed larger <b>displays</b> farther and lower while maintaining the <b>display</b> top at or near eye height. Preferred position of the dual <b>displays</b> in landscape setting did not differ from that of a single <b>display.</b> It appears that the preferred <b>display</b> position varies with the vertical dimension of the overall viewable area of the <b>display.</b> Application: The results of this study can be used to determine the dimensions or adjustability of computer workstations for larger <b>displays</b> or multiple <b>displays</b> settings. close 6...|$|R
