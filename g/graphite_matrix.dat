40|$|In this study, we use x-ray {{diffraction}} (XRD) and micro Raman spectroscopy (MRS) to measure internal strains in sensors embedded in polymer matrix composites. Two types of strain sensors embedded in either chopped <b>graphite</b> fiber/epoxy <b>matrix</b> composite (MRS) or unidirectional <b>graphite</b> fiber/polyimide <b>matrix</b> composite (XRD) were investigated. For XRD measurements, the sensors {{were in the}} form of spherical aluminum inclusions with diameters ranging from 1 to 20 �m. Due to large cross section area of an incident x-ray beam, only average stresses are reported using the XRD approach. Complementary to XRD experiments, MRS was pursued to measure internal strains in Kevlar- 49 fibers embedded in chopped <b>graphite</b> fiber/epoxy <b>matrix</b> composite. In recent years, MRS as an experimental tool for micro-strain measurements has drawn considerable attention mostly due to its excellent spatial resolution. The resolution of MRS typically ranges between 1 and 10 �m, which means that strains can be measured in individual sensors. The principle of this method relies on a change of certain molecular vibration frequencies {{as a result of an}} applied stress. Several examples are presented and discussed to demonstrate the potential of combining micro and macro strain measurements and modeling to capture the stress distribution in heterogeneous materials...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this program was to {{demonstrate}} the utility of coal extracts from the West Virginia University (WVU) extraction process as suitable base raw materials for the carbon products encompassed by the Carbon Products Consortium (CPC) team. These include binder and impregnation pitches, Coke for graphite electrodes, Cokes for anodes and specialty <b>graphite,</b> <b>matrices</b> for C/C composites and raw material for mesophase pitch fibers. Previous work in this program has shown that the WVU coal extraction process coupled with hydrotreatment, does have the potential for achieving this objective.

The program involved an initial characterization of small-scale extracts using standard analytical methods and mesophase formation studies. This was followed by feedback to the WVU Group and to the CPC partners with recommendation of material for scaleup. Similar analytical and mesophase studies on some of the scaled-up extracts was performed.
