500|$|Several {{actors were}} {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Robert Modell, even Lance Henriksen, who went on to play the lead role in Millennium. Initially, Gilligan considered Harvey Fierstein for the role of Modell, but Robert Wisden read the script and [...] "blew us away". Rob Bowman was pleased with Wisden's performance and said, [...] "I thought Robert Wisden was great as Pusher. He is a very energized kind of confident actor with lots of ideas of his own. It took me about {{a day and a half}} to get him into it, and then I never had to speak to him again, because he had that look in his eyes. I would walk up to talk to him about the scene and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he was already there.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{encourage}} the captains of the merchant ships of all countries which carry the lifeblood of the U.K., I {{made it a point}} to attend the briefing conference of all captains and chief engineers before their departure. During the winter of '42–'43, when sinkings were at their worst, I could see when I told them of the measures by escort and air cover that were being taken for their protection and safety; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they knew very well and that they knew I knew in spite of my brave words, that anything up to 25 per cent of them would probably not arrive in the U.K. in their own ships, and that probably half of that number would not arrive in the U.K. at all. But there was never a waver in their resolve – Admiral Murray.|$|E
500|$|Marvel Studios co-president Louis D’Esposito later {{stated that}} Marvel was {{considering}} {{the idea of}} introducing established characters who may not yet be ready to carry their own feature films in future One-Shots, stating, [...] "There’s always a potential to introduce a character. We have 8,000 of them, and they can’t all be at the same level. So maybe {{there are some that}} are not so popular, and we introduce them [...] – and they take off. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> happening." [...] When asked whether a Marvel superhero would ever appear in a One-Shot, D'Esposito replied that [...] "We would love to, but it’s difficult because there’s a cost to that. If Iron Man is flying around doing something, that [...] very costly. And first of all, what’s the story? Is it important that that superhero is in the story?" ...|$|E

500|$|Critic Grace Dent has likened Dot and Jim to [...] Coronation Streets Hilda and Stan Ogden, {{comparing}} a {{scene in}} EastEnders where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from Coronation Street, that aired decades before. Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: [...] "Initially, Jim wasn't {{the sort of person}} that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied– he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot– heaven knows why! I think that you always have to work out for yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around." [...] Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying [...] "We work very well together– he's got great timing and he can be very tender too." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2011, Marvel {{announced}} {{a series of}} direct-to-video short films called Marvel One-Shots, the name derived from the label used by Marvel Comics for their one-shot comics. Co-producer Brad Winderbaum said [...] "It's a fun way to experiment with new characters and ideas, but more importantly it's a {{way for us to}} expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe and tell stories that live outside the plot of our features." [...] Each short film is designed to be a self-contained story that provides more backstory for characters or events introduced in the films. In July 2012, D'Esposito stated that Marvel was considering the idea of introducing established characters who may not yet be ready to carry their own feature films in future One-Shots, stating, [...] "There's always a potential to introduce a character. We have 8,000 of them, and they can't all be at the same level.

But what right did our coach have to tell the other players, [...] "Don't worry, fellows, you played without a full-back today'. I found that out two days later and you can imagine how I felt." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his autobiography, Hand {{concedes that}} this was perhaps a mistake and that perhaps he should have re-negotiated the offer. In the foreword, Sather {{expressed}} his disappointment that [...] "he didn't accept my deal because he could have advanced in North America. His progress would have been celebrated." [...] Indeed, Sather also says [...] "At the training camp <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{he had a great}} ability to read the ice and he was the smartest player there other than Wayne Gretzky. He skated well: his intelligence on the ice stood out. He was a real prospect." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, Rebecca Welles {{arranged}} {{to see her}} mother {{for the first time}} in seven years. Speaking to his lifelong friend Roger Hill, Orson Welles expressed his concern about the visit's effect on his daughter. [...] "Rita barely knows me now," [...] Welles said. He recalled seeing Hayworth three years before at an event which the Reagans held for Frank Sinatra. [...] "When it was over, I came over to her table and I saw that she was very beautiful, very reposed looking, and didn't know me at first. After about four minutes of speaking, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she realized who I was, and she began to cry quietly." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "There {{are stories}} that I quit Sabbat because {{the rest of}} the band didn't like my pagan lyrics. That's not true. All of us shared an {{interest}} in paganism. The paganism was never a problem; I was always left {{to get on with the}} lyrics the best way I saw fit. No, the truth was that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the music was going to get even more complex. Andy was writing 11 minute musical epics and I couldn't even begin to see how I'd write lyrics for something like that. I wanted to bring in other musical styles, to bring in violins for instance. That would never have worked with Sabbat." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fischer makes several {{atmospheric}} {{observations about}} his opponent's habits and {{reaction to his}} moves. In the opening game he writes that [...] "Sherwin slid the rook with his pinky, as if to emphasize the cunning of this mysterious move." [...] In another game he recalls that [...] "Petrosian and Tal both happened to stroll by the board at this point. Petrosian made a wry face which {{looked to me like}} 'Can Black do this and live?'." [...] "Poker-faced as always Keres made this move as though it was the most natural one on the board" [...] (Game 37). [...] "From the glint in his eye <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he had come prepared for my King's Indian" [...] (on the game against Botvinnik).|$|E

And then I knew I had him. The next thought in my mind was I'm going to ask for $30,000. You always ask for twice as much as what you hope to get. He put me on hold, and within less than a minute he came back and he said 'well, we can't give you thirty, we'll give you ten.' I said 'make if fifteen,' he said 'you have a deal.'"

2500|$|Carmichael joined ASCAP in 1931. The {{following}} year {{he began working}} as a songwriter for Ralph Peer's Southern Music Company, the first music firm to occupy the new Brill Building, which became famous as a New York songwriting mecca. The Great Depression rapidly {{put an end to}} the jazz scene of the Roaring Twenties. People were no longer attending clubs or buying music, forcing many musicians out of work. Carmichael was fortunate to retain his low-paying, but stable job as a songwriter with Southern Music. Beiderbecke's early death in 1931 also darkened Carmichael's mood. Of that time, he wrote later: [...] "I was tiring of jazz and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> other musicians were tiring as well. The boys were losing their enthusiasm for the hot stuff…. No more hot licks, no more thrills." ...|$|E

He could and would act – wasn't he the ringleader of the students? ... I could imagine no greater pleasure than serving the revolution.

I knew only the house serfs of Biakolovo and the members of my weaving collective, while he was himself a worker by birth.|$|E
2500|$|Alderman {{was injured}} in the first test of the 1982-83 Ashes. He had taken 1-84 in the first innings {{when there was a}} pitch invasion. Alderman was hit {{in the back of the}} head by a member of the crowd, Gary Donnison. Alderman recalled, [...] "he ran off, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> there were no police in the {{vicinity}} so I attempted to apprehend him." [...] Alderman charged at Donnison and tackled him to the ground but fell on his shoulder and injured himself. [...] "I can't remember a lot of how I fell ... but I was immediately aware I was injured ... it was very painful indeed," [...] Alderman said. [...] "At the time I thought it would just pop back in - little did I know that it would be a year before I could bowl in a competitive match again," [...] he said. [...] "I had to learn to swim a mile a day for eight months. What is tough in sport, is that if you have a physical injury or problem, no one wants to know you.

2500|$|Netanyahu defines {{capitalism}} as [...] "the {{ability to}} have individual initiative and competition to produce goods and services with profit, but not to shut out somebody else from {{trying to do the}} same." [...] He says that his views developed while he was working as an economic consult for Boston Consulting Group: [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the Boston Consulting Group looked at governments and worked for governments. They wanted to do a strategic plan for the government of Sweden. I was on that case and looked at other governments. So I went around to other governments in Europe in 1976 and I was looking at Britain. I was looking at France. I was looking at other countries, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they were stymied by concentrations of power that prevented competition. And I thought, hmm, as bad as they are, ours was worse because we had very little room for private sector competition to the extent that we had government-controlled or union-controlled companies, and so you really didn't get the competition or the growth... And I said, well, if I ever have a chance, I'll change that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the Boston Globe {{disclosed}} that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with retired agent John Connolly (later sentenced to 40 years in prison), who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, [...] "The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them." [...] According to Weeks, [...] "As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept telling me that 90 percent of {{the information in the}} files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> a lot of the reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. I would see, over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything." ...|$|E
