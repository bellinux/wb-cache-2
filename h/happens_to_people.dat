25|$|It is {{possible}} for schizophrenia to develop at any age, but it mostly <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> within the ages of 16–30 (generally males 16–25 and females 25–30) - about 75 percent of people living with the illness develop it at this age. There is a likelihood of children developing schizophrenia, though it is quite rare {{before the age of}} 12. Also, new cases are uncommon after age 40. In addition, about 1 percent of the world's population will develop schizophrenia over their lifetime, therefore out of all the people born, one in 100 will develop schizophrenia by age 55. There is on average a somewhat earlier onset for men than women, with the possible influence of the female hormone estrogen being one hypothesis and sociocultural influences another.|$|E
500|$|In her songs, Allen {{develops}} various personas. She {{stated that}} {{she tried to}} [...] "write about stuff that <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> from all different backgrounds". The lyrics are conversational, with a dark sense of humour. In many of the songs, one of Allen's personae disparages someone around her. In [...] "Smile", [...] "Not Big", and [...] "Shame for You", she insults an ex-boyfriend. In [...] "Knock 'Em Out", she mocks suitors at a bar, and Lily reprimands her brother Alfie on {{the song of the}} same name.|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment Weiss spoke about Arya's story, saying [...] "Arya is in danger, she's got an open wound in her stomach, and the one person who has protected her to this point unfortunately gets murdered. The fact that the Many-Faced God gets {{the people who have been}} promised to him really makes you think that there's almost an inevitability about what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm going to walk away,' and I think she knows what the answer's going to be. The implication, obviously, is that Jaqen was, on some level, rooting for the outcome that he got. He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells us something that we've kind of known all along, that she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E

500|$|American Tragedy {{opens with}} the single [...] "Been to Hell". J-Dog said that the song is, [...] "the truth about what really <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> when they move to L.A., to be actors or models or God knows what other {{delusions}} people have... failure. It's all too true, but most people aren't {{there to see it}} first-hand. But we are, so it's our interpretation of it all." [...] The track is followed by [...] "Apologize", a track that directly addresses critics and states the band's defiance in the face of negative opinions, as evident by the chorus, [...] "We don't apologize and that's just the way it is, but we can harmonize even if we sound like shit." [...] Third is [...] "Comin’ in Hot", a party song and the album's fourth single that uses humor to describe what happens in night clubs. [...] "My Town" [...] is the fifth single and a mid-tempo song talking about Los Angeles and Hollywood. Next is [...] "I Don't Wanna Die", a song about the fear of death fueling the need to kill another person. [...] "Hear Me Now" [...] was the lead single from the album and is about the troubles each band member was going through at the time the song was written. The song's lyrics tell the story of a person who is depressed and hopeless, taking a very somber tone to the track. Despite this, the instruments and melodies contrast to make an uptempo track. Next is [...] "Gangsta Sexy", a party anthem song about heading to nightclubs and pursuing women. The following track, [...] "Glory", is a metal-inspired song which drew influence from war and fighting. [...] "Lights Out", the ninth song on the album, is about Deuce, ex-vocalist of Hollywood Undead. It is a response to [...] "Story of a Snitch". [...] "Coming Back Down", the third single released from the album, is a rock ballad song with acoustic guitars on the track. The lyrics describes about a story of an unknown loved one who has recently died, with the narrator having difficulty trying to live without them. [...] "Bullet", the eleventh track from the album, is an uptempo pop song about suicide. It is played in an upbeat tempo with energetic vocals, which gives contrast to the dark lyrical content. Rick Florino called the track, [...] "heart-wrenching genius". [...] "Levitate" [...] is an uptempo discothèque song about sex, while the verses of the song talk about suicide and alcoholism. It was also featured in the [...] trailer, [...] "Autolog Drift Challenge", {{as well as on the}} game's soundtrack, where it was ranked eighth on ProGamists list of [...] "Top ten songs featured in racing games".|$|E

[...] He said, [...] "I am heartbroken. I just cannot believe what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>people,</b> what is done to them {{in the name of the}} law.

2500|$|Typically, Doctor Whos anniversary {{stories are}} {{named after the}} number of {{returning}} Doctors, as with The Three Doctors and The Five Doctors. Moffat explained his choice of title to SFX magazine, commenting that [...] "... it's very rare in Doctor Who that the story happens to the Doctor. It <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> around him, and he helps out – he's the hero figure who rides in and saves everybody from {{the story of the}} week. He is not the story of the week. In this, he {{is the story of the}} week. This is the day of the Doctor. This is his most important day. His most important moment. This is the one he'll remember, whereas I often think the Doctor wanders back to his TARDIS and forgets all about it." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{morning of}} our {{departure}} was particularly lovely and we trekked {{away in the}} best of spirits, as so often <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> who are marching into trouble. Of our journey there is little to say as everything went smoothly, so that we arrived {{at the edge of the}} high-veld feeling as happy as the country which has no history is reported to do. Our road led us past the little mining settlement of Pilgrim's Rest where a number of adventurous spirits, most of them English, were engaged in washing for gold, a job at which I once took a turn near this very place without any startling success. Of the locality I need only say that the mountainous scenery is among the most beautiful, the hills are the steepest and the roads are, or were, the worst that I have ever travelled over in a wagon.|$|E
