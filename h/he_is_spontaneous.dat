Punjabi channels like ABP Sanjha and Hamdard TV gave very positive reviews to the film.|$|R

5|$|After {{his first}} novel, The Wooden Horse, in 1909, Walpole wrote prolifically, {{producing}} {{at least one}} book every year. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> a <b>spontaneous</b> story-teller, writing quickly to get all his ideas on paper, seldom revising. His first novel to achieve major success was his third, Mr Perrin and Mr Traill, a tragicomic story of a fatal clash between two schoolmasters. During the First World War {{he served in the}} Red Cross on the Russian-Austrian front, and worked in British propaganda in Petrograd and London. In the 1920s and 1930s Walpole was much in demand not only as a novelist but also as a lecturer on literature, making four exceptionally well-paid tours of North America.|$|R

[...] "I realized that I'd have to make use of my own spontaneity, because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> so <b>spontaneous.</b> And I admired his guts[...] [...] [...] That intimacy is what an actor tries to get[...] [...] [...] It occurred to me that if I had known him, I would have wanted us to <b>be</b> friends…and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a provocateur, and I love to provoke."

5000|$|Tatum {{could also}} play the blues with authority. Pianist Jay McShann, {{not known for}} {{showering}} compliments on his rivals, said [...] "Art could really play the blues. To me, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the world's greatest blues player, and I think few people realized that." [...] Tatum's repertoire, however, was predominantly Broadway and popular standards, whose chord progressions and variety better suited his talents. [...] His protean style was elaborate, pyrotechnic, dramatic and joyous, combining stride, jazz, swing, boogie-woogie and classical elements, while the musical ideas flowed in rapid-fire fashion. Benny Green wrote in his collected work of essays, The Reluctant Art, that [...] "Tatum {{has been the only}} jazz musician to date who has made an attempt to conceive a style based upon all styles, to master the mannerisms of all schools and then synthesize those into something personal."

40|$|The {{question}} {{whether it is}} possible to be both a Humean and a contractarian arises from the interpretation of Hume as a theorist of spontaneous order, a theory that is usually taken to be incompatible with contractarianism. I argue that this interpretation is unconvincing and anachronistic. The real reason why it is problematic to view Hume as a contractarian <b>is</b> not because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> proponent of <b>spontaneous</b> order, but because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a virtue-ethicist. I argue that Hume adopted and elaborated on the natural law account of the origins of property as conventional, but provided a different and separate account of the obligation to respect property rights...|$|R
5000|$|The {{convergence}} of these influences {{lead to the}} creation of the image of the iconoclastic Chan-master, who fulfilled all these requirements: <b>He</b> <b>was</b> free and <b>spontaneous,</b> and so served the liberal wen faction in their struggle against the guwen partisans at court. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> untainted by any need for political power, and so did not threaten the authority of the dynasty or its bureaucracy. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> Buddhist, and so could be brought forward when the need arose to show that the empire supported Buddhism. He made for entertaining reading, which suited the needs of a newly-literated reading public. Finally, he asserted the superiority of the Linji lineage and its [...] "golden age of Chan" [...] style, thus suiting the then-dominant faction.|$|R

Additionally, Mikey meets with his estranged wife, and when she claims that the reason their {{marriage}} fell apart <b>is</b> because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not <b>spontaneous</b> enough, Mikey kisses her, and the two sleep together in the hospital, reigniting their romance. All three friends attempt to keep their relationships a secret, due to their earlier agreement that they would stay single. The relationships all come to a head during Thanksgiving, a time that the three friends usually spend together, but varying circumstances keep them apart. Jason agrees to attend a funeral for Ellie's recently passed father, Mikey plans a Thanksgiving dinner with his wife, and Daniel attends the traditional Thanksgiving feast with Chelsea, free to openly tell the guests about their relationship.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{his work}} is {{classified}} as neo-figurative. His work {{has been described as}} a “… skillful exercise of composition and color, of the transformation of color to a primordial form…” He often paints without sketching first once he has a theme as <b>he</b> likes to <b>be</b> <b>spontaneous.</b> Cora believes that art should relate to “ancestral memory” and old myths applied to modern reality. His development as an artist has not experienced serious changes in direction or jumps from one style to another. He has maintained a consistent identity, using rich colors in a minimalist style. His painting technique is not sophisticated or elegant but rather expressionist, coarse and spontaneous. His use of light and color shows influence from Rufino Tamayo. Northern Mexican influence in his work comes from classes in Tijuana as well as exhibitions and work done in Laguna Beach and other cities in California.|$|R
