5|$|Sharpe James, who {{defeated}} Gibson in 1986 {{and declined}} {{to run for}} a sixth term in 2006, was indicted on 33 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, and wire fraud by {{a federal grand jury}} sitting in Newark. The grand jury charged James with spending $58,000 on city-owned credit cards <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> <b>gain</b> and orchestrating a scheme to sell city-owned land at below-market prices to his companion, who immediately re-sold the land to developers and gained a profit of over $500,000. James pleaded not guilty on 25 counts at his initial court appearance on July 12, 2007. On April 17, 2008, James was found guilty {{for his role in the}} conspiring to rig land sales at nine city-owned properties <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> <b>gain.</b> The former mayor was sentenced to serve up to 27 months in prison, and was released on April 6, 2010, for good behavior.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his military ambitions, Himmler established {{the beginnings of a}} parallel economy under the umbrella of the SS. To this end, administrator Oswald Pohl set up the Deutsche Wirtschaftsbetriebe (German Economic Enterprise) in 1940. Under the auspices of the SS Economy and Administration Head Office, this holding company owned housing corporations, factories, and publishing houses. Pohl was unscrupulous and quickly exploited the companies <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> <b>gain.</b> In contrast, Himmler was honest in matters of money and business.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{an orderly}} for the colony's first Governor, Arthur Phillip, Baker was later {{appointed}} government storekeeper in Parramatta, and storekeeper and superintendent of convicts {{in the rural}} settlement of Hawkesbury. In 1810 he was dismissed from all government posts after being found to have misused his position <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> <b>gain,</b> and relocated to Hobart where he became the inaugural crier for Australia's oldest colony-wide judicature, the Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land.|$|E

5|$|On June 17, 1953, Nunn {{declared}} as a Republican {{candidate for}} county judge and was ultimately the only Republican to declare. In the Democratic primary, {{one of the}} challengers charged that the incumbent had used his office <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> <b>gain.</b> In {{the wake of the}} investigation, a group of disgruntled Democrats formed an organization to elect Nunn, who defeated his Democratic challenger by a vote of 5,171 to 4,378, becoming the first Republican elected county judge {{in the history of the}} heavily Democratic county.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} full term in Congress, Jennings stepped up his attacks on Harrison, accusing him of using his office <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> <b>gain,</b> of taking part in {{questionable}} land speculation deals, and needlessly raising tensions with the Native American tribes on the frontier. Jennings presented a congressional resolution that intended to reduce Harrison's authority to make political appointments and opposed his policy of purchasing lands from the Indians. When Harrison was up for reappointment as territorial governor in 1810, Jennings sent a scathing letter to President James Madison that argued against his reappointment. Harrison's allies in Washington argued on his behalf and aided in securing his reappointment.|$|E
5|$|Neild {{began to}} {{encounter}} difficulties in {{his political career}} {{towards the end of}} the 1880s; his oversight of the establishment of the 1887 Adelaide Jubilee International Exhibition led to investigation by a Legislative Assembly select committee, which absolved him of accusations of extravagance and using his office <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> <b>gain.</b> In 1895 he began to agitate for old-age pensions, but in 1899 he was investigated again after Premier George Reid paid him £350 for writing a report; although Neild repaid the money, the incident was part of the pretext for a successful no confidence motion in September which brought down the Reid government.|$|E

5|$|Historians Félix Luna, Miguel Angel de Marco and Fernando Rocchi all {{praise the}} role of Raúl Alfonsín in the {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War and the restoration of democracy. Luna also considers that Alfonsín was an effective president, and that he set an example of not using the state <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> <b>gain.</b> De Marco points out that it was a delicate time period, and any mistake could have endangered the newly founded democracy and led to another coup. The aforementioned historians do not agree, though, on their view of the Pact of Olivos. Luna considers that it was a necessary evil to prevent the chaos that would have been generated if Menem managed to proceed with the constitutional amendment without negotiating with the UCR. De Marco and Rocchi instead believe that it was the biggest mistake of Alfonsín's political career.|$|E
5|$|The {{streetcar}} {{system was}} built by Twin City Rapid Transit and operated efficiently through 1949, with a program of reinvesting their profits into system improvements. However, in 1949, New York investor Charles Green gained control of the system, halted the rebuilding program, and announced a goal of completely converting the system to buses by 1958. These policies alienated the public and he was ousted in 1951, but his successor, Fred Ossanna, continued to cut service and replace the system with buses. On June 19, 1954, the last streetcar took its run. A photo taken in 1954 shows James Towley handing Fred Ossanna a check while one of the streetcars burned in the background. Later on, {{it was discovered that}} Ossanna and associates had plundered the streetcar system <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> <b>gain.</b> A small section of the line between Lake Calhoun and Lake Harriet is now operated by the Minnesota Streetcar Museum.|$|E
5|$|Hartley {{explained}} that Arthur would {{be aware of}} his powers {{at the beginning of}} the series and would have no problem using them <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> <b>gain.</b> Hartley felt this played against the typical superheroes, because his character was not afraid to flaunt his abilities. Gough explained A.C. would be able to swim faster than humans, breathe underwater, as well as have super strength while underwater. He also stated that exposure to water on land would give him powers. The extent of his speed is shown in the pilot, when Arthur is able to keep up with a fighter jet flying above him. The extent of A.C.'s ability to breathe underwater was not elaborated upon, but he is seen swimming near the bottom of the ocean near the start of the pilot. When A.C. is talking to Eva about releasing captive dolphins, he tells her that he felt as though the dolphins were somehow calling to him. In the comics, one of Aquaman's powers is the ability to communicate with sea life. Gough likened A.C.'s not having access to water to Clark's growing weak around kryptonite in Smallville – if A.C. does not get water, he will dehydrate and weaken. Water gives him a power boost and enables producers to explore stories on land.|$|E

5|$|The SS owned {{experimental}} farms, bakeries, meat packing plants, leather works, {{clothing and}} uniform factories, and small arms factories. Under {{the direction of}} the WVHA, the SS sold camp labor to various factories at a rate of three to six Reichsmarks per prisoner per day. The SS confiscated and sold the property of concentration camp inmates, confiscated their investment portfolios and their cash, and profited from their dead bodies by selling their hair to make felt and melting down their dental work to obtain gold from the fillings. The total value of assets looted from the victims of Operation Reinhard alone (not including Auschwitz) was listed by Odilo Globocnik as 178,745,960.59 Reichsmarks. Items seized included 2,909.68 kilograms of gold worth 843,802.75 RM, as well as 18,733.69kg of silver, 1,514kg of platinum, 249,771.50 American dollars, 130 diamond solitaires, 2,511.87 carats of brilliants, 13,458.62 carats of diamonds, and 114kg of pearls.

25|$|Some of {{the main}} {{concepts}} of feminist veganism is that is {{the connection between the}} violence and oppression of animals.

This capitalist use of animals <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> <b>gain</b> has held strong, despite the work of animal rights activists and ecofriendly feminists.|$|E
