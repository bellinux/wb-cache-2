The Core Facility consists mainly of a vacuum-tight stainless steel cylinder (Process Chamber) capable of accommodating different individual Furnace Inserts (FIs), within which sample processing is carried out.

On comparison with the ground processed reference samples, {{it appears that the}} distribution of the particles in the molten zone is much more homogeneous in the zero gravity cast specimens. Also additional tests were performed in a high <b>gradient</b> <b>furnace</b> (ASPF - advanced solidification processing facility) and in a low <b>gradient</b> <b>furnace</b> to complement the results of the space processed samples. A higher temperature gradient, where the gradient is parallel to the direction of solidification and opposite to the gravity, gives less convection.

During the growth, heat pulses were intentionally introduced periodically to create the growth striations. From the striations, the growth rate of the grown crystal was estimated. The results show that the growth rate was gradually increased {{from the beginning of the}} growth and became stable. On the other hand the In composition of the grown crystal decreased along the growth direction.

40|$|The {{availability}} of large, single crystals of {{cadmium zinc telluride}} (CZT) with uniform properties would lead to improved performance of gamma radiation detectors fabricated from them.
