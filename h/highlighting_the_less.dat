40|$|Food webs and trophic {{dynamics}} of coastal {{systems have been}} the focus of intense research throughout the world, as they prove to be critical in understanding ecosystem processes and functions. However, very few studies have undertaken a quantitative comparison of entire food webs from a key consumer perspective across a broad geographical area, limiting relevant comparisons among systems with distinct biotic and abiotic components. We investigate the structure and functioning of food webs in four tidal ecosystems of international importance for migratory shorebirds along the East Atlantic Flyway: Tejo estuary in Portugal, Sidi Moussa in Morocco, Banc d'Arguin in Mauritania and Bijagós archipelago in Guinea-Bissau. Basal food sources, shorebirds and their prey (benthic invertebrates) were sampled in all areas, and Bayesian stable isotope mixing models and community-wide metrics were used in a comparative analysis among areas. Significant differences among study areas were found in the structure of food webs, {{as well as in the}} relative importance of basal resource pools supporting each food web. Overall, the food web of Banc d'Arguin was characterized by lower trophic diversity and higher functional redundancy than the other sites. This result might be explained by the low number of trophic pathways of organic matter transfer in this seagrass-dominated system which, as a fossil estuary, lacks inputs from both freshwater and nutrient-rich offshore oceanic waters. Structure of shorebird communities was consistent with the main organizational patterns found for each food web, <b>highlighting</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> diverse character of the community of Banc d'Arguin. At Banc d'Arguin and Bijagós archipelago, which displayed the smallest and largest isotopic niche widths in bird assemblage, respectively, mean niche overlap among species was low, suggesting high interspecific partitioning in resource use. Tropical systems typically offer comparatively lower harvestable prey biomass for shorebirds and might thus strengthen interspecific competition, leading to low niche overlap among species. Our study reveals relevant differences in the structure of food webs and shorebird communities in coastal areas along an avian flyway. While differences in trophic redundancy of food webs point to distinct levels of ecosystem resilience, contrasts in the organization of shorebird communities highlight the plasticity in the foraging behaviour of species inhabiting areas with distinct environmental conditions...|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{fantasy is}} a genre that exists outside the {{boundaries}} of what consensus society constructs as socially normative. It re-appropriates and subverts facets of reality in order to place the reader in a position from which they can re-assess their own socially constructed identities, perspectives, and assumptions. Fantasy accomplishes this goal by expressing the familiar in a mode of hyper-exaggeration designed to <b>highlight</b> <b>the</b> {{ways in which the}} ideals and issues are constructed. In this way fantasy questions and critiques reality. This thesis examines how the contemporary fantasy genre uses magic as a tool to <b>highlight</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> visible social forces of reality such that the reader can gain insight into how and why social norms come to be established, as well as how they might be changed. It discusses the presentation of conflicting cultural and gender identities within fantasy worlds. Works by Brandon Sanderson, Robert Jordan, Jim Butcher, Peter V.

The discussions undertaken in this thesis demonstrate an approach to contemporary fantasy literature that can be further utilised across a multitude of subgenres and social issues of contemporary reality...|$|R
40|$|Gravitational lenses {{have long}} been advertised as {{primitive}} telescopes, capable of magnifying cosmologically distant sources (Zwicky 1937). In this Letter, we present new 0 ''. 9 resolution CO (7 - 6) observations of the z= 2. 56 Cloverleaf quasar (H 1413 + 117) and spatially resolved images. By modeling the gravitational lens, we infer a size scale of 0 ''. 3 (~ 1 kpc) for the molecular gas structure surrounding the quasar, and the gas has a kinematic structure roughly consistent with a rotating disk. The observed properties of the CO emitting gas {{are similar to the}} nuclear starburst complexes found in the infrared luminous galaxies in the local universe, and metal enrichment by vigorous star formation within this massive nuclear gas complex can explain the abundance of carbon and oxygen in the interstellar medium of this system observed when the universe was only a few billion years old.

3000|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} two {{simultaneously}} active sources and present an approach that manipulates basic GCC-PHAT measurements in order to extrapolate and enforce the information associated to both sources. GCC-PHAT postprocessing is performed via acoustic map, which allows one {{to take into account}} implicitly some real constraints introduced by the geometry of the problem (e.g., microphone distribution in space, size of the room, etc.). As shown in the following a good choice of acoustic map is the Global Coherence Field (GCF). The approach can be extended in a straightforward manner to deal with more sources, although in many situations performance may drop as soon as the number of sources is larger than three. Typical scenarios that can benefit from the application of the proposed technique are those characterized by two or more individuals who are speaking together, with temporary overlap of their voices. Experiments on real data collected with different sensor configurations show the effectiveness of the method. In particular, the GCC-PHAT manipulation not only <b>highlights</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> dominant source but also allows one to pinpoint, and then process in the most appropriate way, potential [...] "ghosts" [...] which may be generated by constructive interferences in the acoustic map domain. These ghosts are often related to minor peaks in the GCC-PHAT functions, which are difficult to process in a coherent way across different microphone pairs, while they can be interpreted and compensated via acoustic maps.|$|R

40|$|Harmonized {{information}} on habitat pattern, fragmentation and connectivity is one among the reporting {{needs of the}} biodiversity policy agenda. This paper presents a generic, reproducible and integrated characterisation of patterns into one modelling framework. Three available conceptual landscape model components are customised, revisited and partly combined to derive a set of indices organized into four families: general landscape composition, habitat morphology, edge interface and connectivity. A harmonized mathematical description is provided for known and suggested new indices. Their unambiguous and easy computability is ensured with the integrated use of publicly available software (GUIDOS free-download software, Conefor Sensinode free software) and of newly programmed tools. An edge interface tool combining morphological analysis and a moving window landscape mosaic tridimensional model is presented; a “Power Weighted Probability of Dispersal” (PWPD) function is proposed to make connectivity indices sensitive to the landscape resistance. The methodology is demonstrated for the focal forest habitat, by using sixty-five in-situ based habitat maps from the EBONE project (“European Biodiversity Observation NEtwork”). Twelve indices are applied. A statistical analysis is then conducted using classical linear correlation and nonlinear Brownian Distance Correlation (Mastrave free software modelling library) as alternative to traditional dimensionality-reduction techniques and with an effort towards reusability in other contexts and reproducible research, by means of concise semantic array programming codelets. <b>The</b> results <b>highlight</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> correlated and fundamental pattern components, corroborating the hypothesized hierarchical organization of the indices into four families, and also the feasibility of reducing further the number of indices within each category.

In the years between 1970 and 1980 single parent households had proportionate rights. The modern model does strictly offer progressive benefits to families on the means test of income. Housing benefits have been a modern adaptation into the Icelandic family welfare system. Although there have been additional hours added to preschools in Iceland there are still no legal rights to preschool. There is financial assistance available to single and dual parent households. A single parent household receives about twice as much financial assistance than a dual parent household. This <b>highlights</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> progressive policies for wealth distribution. Iceland's family policy was re-structured for the equality {{of men and women}} in order to distribute balanced family welfare policies and its responsibilities. The framework of family is important to the people of Iceland because they believe social emotional connections develop from the home to the society around them. Although preschools are not mandatory for children to attend, Iceland sets up a structure that makes it most beneficial for both children and their working parents. Icelandic family policy makes child development a fundamental basis for much of their social policy in order to allow them to better develop their intellectual and emotional qualities at a younger age than most other countries. Work settings also help implement gender and family policies by private corporations implementing social policies to help support their government's mission for equality and progress.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{describe}} the value and philosophy of lifeworld-led care. Our purpose is to give a philosophically coherent foundation for lifeworld-led care and its core value as a humanising force that moderates technological progress. We begin by indicating the timeliness of these concerns within the current context of citizen-oriented, participative approaches to healthcare. We believe that this context {{is in need of}} a deepening philosophy if it is not to succumb to the discourses of mere consumerism. We thus revisit the potential of Husserl’s notion of the lifeworld and how lifeworld-led care could provide important ideas and values that are central to the humanisation of healthcare practice. This framework provides a synthesis of the main arguments of the paper and is finally expressed in a model of lifeworld-led care that includes its core value, core perspectives, relevant indicative methodologies and main benefits. The model is offered as a potentially broad-based approach for integrating many existing practices and trends. In the spirit of Husserl’s interest in both commonality and variation, we <b>highlight</b> <b>the</b> central, <b>less</b> contestable foundations of lifeworld-led care, without constraining the possible varieties of confluent practices.

40|$|Few {{terms in}} {{organisational}} studies inspire less agreement than leadership. It is a slippery concept and {{much that is}} written on the subject is confusing and contradictory. Early theories of leadership have, generally, reduced leadership behaviour to a concern for task balanced against {{a concern for the}} well-being of employees. This two-dimensional approach {{has proved to be a}} limited conceptualisation of leadership. In response, over the past thirty years, researchers have tried to <b>highlight</b> <b>the</b> <b>less</b> rationalistic, more intangible, aspects of leadership. However, there is still very little in leadership research that conveys a sense of the leader as a person. I have argued, in this study, that the reason for this lies in the fact that most leadership research has been conducted along positivistic lines and, therefore, cannot take into account the values, feelings, morals and life experiences of the human beings being studied. Thus, for the human being to take centre-stage in leadership enquiry, a different research paradigm needs to be explored. I have chosen to use phenomenological enquiry as an avenue for examining how John Stoker, the leader of the Rhodes University Mathematics Education Project (RUMEP), experiences being a leader. This is because phenomenology, in both theory and practice, privileges the nature of the meanings that people construct in their lives and that guide their actions. In adopting such a methodology my research findings have examined a number of issues that are of interest to current leadership researchers, however they have also highlighted a number of concerns that have not been explored thoroughly in the leadership literature. These include the importance of the individual leader’s action, intention and will in shaping an organisation, the complex nature of a leader’s creativity within the organisation and possible differences between educational leaders and business leaders. In adopting a phenomenological perspective the eccentricity and fulness of an individual leader’s action is expressed through the research, however, the research also focusses on how the researcher translates and evolving philosophical understanding into sound methodology. Therefore, interwoven into the discussions on leadership there are reflections on how I applied phenomenological theory. The purpose of these reflections is to deliberate on the appropriateness of applying such a methodology to the eclectic field of leadership and to show how my own developing philosophical attitude has transformed into practice. ...|$|R

Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) and phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) plays {{crucial role in the}} pathophysiology of hemorrhage by targeting/altering the platelets function which may result in thrombocytopenia. Platelets undergo the classic events of mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway due to augmented endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The observed anticoagulant effects during viper envenomations could be due to exacerbated platelet apoptosis and thrombocytopenia. Moreover, antivenin treatments are ineffective against the venom-induced oxidative stress; therefore, it necessitates an auxiliary therapy involving antioxidants which can effectively scavenge the endothelium-generated/endogenous ROS and protect the platelets. The present study explored the effects of viper venom on platelet apoptosis and its amelioration by a phytochemical crocin. The study evaluated the Vipera russelli venom-induced apoptotic events including endogenous ROS generation, intracellular Ca(2 +) mobilization, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cyt-c translocation, caspase activation and phosphatidylserine externalization which were effectively mitigated when the venom was pre-treated with crocin. <b>The</b> study <b>highlights</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>less</b> studied features of venom-induced secondary complications i. e. platelet apoptosis and sheds light on the underlying basis for venom-induced thrombocytopenia, systemic hemorrhage and in vivo anticoagulant effect.

Elderly women are one among the weak and vulnerable sections of the society. In the ancient of days women were worshiped as goddesses in Vedic period as the days pass the status of women are fluctuating. As the elderly population are increasing in the globalising world is challenging in present and future days. The generation gap is <b>highlighting</b> <b>the</b> elderly disrespect; <b>less</b> dignity and <b>the</b> negligence of elderly population are haunting their lives. The study was conducted in a social welfare organisation in Chennai known as ARUWE. The study was conducted on 30 elderly women inmates using census method. The standardised instrument was used to measure Quality of life (QOL) is WHO – BREF 1996. The researcher had used descriptive design to describe the facts. The main objective of the study is to make investigation on quality of life under four domains like physical, psychological, socia...|$|R

This {{phenomenon}} depends on several parameters such as geographical situation and environmental conditions. Among the parameters, the surface state of substrates is often considered as the most crucial parameter favoring the biofouling kinetics. Several researches have been devoted {{to the study of}} the effects of porosity and roughness on the biofouling of stones and mortars. However, none of them have addressed the influence of the mortars chemistry on the kinetics of the microorganism growth. Aim The main objective of this study is to <b>highlight</b> <b>the</b> influence of the mortar chemistry in relationship with its physical properties on the algal growth. Materials and methods The biofouling kinetics was followed on samples exposed outdoor and on samples tested in a laboratory bench which consists in spraying an algal culture on mortar specimens. The kinetics of microorganism growth was measured by image analysis which allows calculating the coverage rate. The green algae Klebsormidium flaccidum were chosen because of its representativeness. It is indeed the species the most frequently identified and isolated from samples taken on sites. In order to characterize the influence of the mortar chemistry on biofouling, two Portland cements and two alumina cements were tested. The influence of mortar physical properties was studied by comparing two porosity and two roughnesses for each formulation. The carbonation impact on biofouling was also evaluated. Results The colonization rate increases with the porosity of mortar specimens, whatever the cement used in the mortar formulation. The impact of mortar chemical composition is more easily <b>highlighted</b> for <b>the</b> <b>less</b> porous mortars. In that case the biofouling kinetics is faster for Portland mortars than for aluminate mortars. The accelerated carbonation of the materials increases the biofouling rate, whatever the cement used. The calcium carbonate layer formed by accelerated carbonation produces a more favorable environment and the decrease in surface pH favors the growth of green algae. The roughness also influences the biofouling kinetics since the rough surfaces are colonized quicker than the smoothest one. However, its effect is not major in our case. The results of outdoor tests are similar to the results obtained in laboratory. The influence of mortar chemistry on biofouling kinetics is better highlighted on outdoor test because microalgae are submitted to environmental stresses. It is not the case in the laboratory test since the algal suspension is full of nutrients which make the environment friendlier than outside conditions. Conclusions The chemical composition of mortars strongly influences their biofouling. Calcium aluminate mortars slow down the colonization kinetics compared to Portland based mortars. The porosity increases the biofouling kinetics. The carbonation also influences the biofouling. The outdoor test allows <b>highlighting</b> <b>the</b> chemical influence on biofouling kinetics...|$|R
