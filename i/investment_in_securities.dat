Ordinary Least Square method of Multiple Regression Analysis was used to manipulate the time series data into Econometric model of inflation, while F test was used to test the formulated hypotheses.

40|$|Information {{security}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly serious problem faced by many enterprises and organizations that perform part of their business processes via the Internet. It has been a hot topic among the industry and the academic community for many years. However, {{most of the research}} done in this field focuses on security technologies, while only {{a very small percentage of}} it focuses on economics of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>security.</b> Gordon and Loeb [1] have put forth a simple but useful model to determine the optimal <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>security.</b> They consider the <b>investment</b> made <b>in</b> preventive mechanism, and derive that the optimal level of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> information <b>security</b> should not exceed 37 % of the expected loss caused by the vulnerability without any protection, for two classes of security breach probability functions: power function and exponential function. Based on Gordon and Loeb's work, this thesis first relaxes the specific assumption of the functional form of the security breach probability function, and provides a more general result on the upper bound of optimal <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>security.</b> Second, it introduces hacker's response behavior and detective mechanism, and as a result makes a more general and adaptive economic model of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> information <b>security.</b> It is concluded that for an arbitrary form of security breach probability function, the optimal level of total <b>investment</b> made <b>in</b> both preventive and detective mechanisms should not exceed one half of the expected loss without any protection; and this upper bound still holds if the hacker's response behavior is integrated to the model. In addition, this thesis derives the circumstance under which the investment should be made in detective mechanism for a better overall performance.

In this period, while Mitsubishi Holdings rapidly expanded the total <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>securities,</b> it substantially changed the portfolio, increasing investment in the companies in the munitions industry. This portfolio management policy was not successful in terms of profitability. We decomposed the profitability decline into that due to the declines in the returns on the individual securities which had existed in the portfolio and that due to {{the change in}} the portfolio. We found that whereas the former factor was larger, the portfolio factor was also substantial. This result suggests that the asset management system of Mitsubishi Holdings came not to work well, which in turn would be due to government intervention and deterioration of the governance within Mitsubishi Zaibatsu. ...|$|E

The discussions on the policies implemented by Central Bank are presented {{as well as the}} analyses for three liquidity ratios, using time series data and ordinary least squares. The main hypotheses of the thesis are: there is a positive correlation between the liquidity level and proportion of foreign capital to total bank capital; higher capital adequacy ratio leads to better liquidity ratios; liquidity is procyclic and thus depends positively on the economic growth of the country and we presume negative correlation between discount rate and liquidity. In addition to the aforementioned hypotheses, we also examine the effect of additional explanatory variables such as inflation, total assets of banking sector, spread between loans and deposits, ratio of non-performing loans to capital, unemployment rate, returns on assets and equity, and <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>securities.</b> The quick liquidity ratio, short-term liquidity ratio, and current ratio are used as dependent variables and separate model is constructed for each of them.
