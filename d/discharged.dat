The sequence of coal <b>discharge</b> can be categorized as sequential coal <b>discharge</b> and alternated coal <b>discharge.</b> The times of coal <b>discharge</b> at each <b>discharge</b> window can be categorized as single, double and multiple coal <b>discharges.</b> The number of coal <b>discharge</b> window opened in the same time can be categorized as single window <b>discharge</b> and multiple window <b>discharge.</b> The number of simultaneously opened <b>discharge</b> window can be categorized as single coal <b>discharge</b> and multiple coal <b>discharge.</b> The quantity of coal <b>discharge</b> can be categorized as equal quantity and non-equal quantity. Because it is difficult to manage equal or non-equal quantity coal <b>discharge</b> in operation, and single or multiple coal <b>discharge</b> can be managed in labor planning, however the determination of the coal <b>discharge</b> method is mainly based on the sequence of coal <b>discharge</b> and the times of coal <b>discharge</b> at each <b>discharge</b> window. There are four main alternative methods including single sequential coal <b>discharge,</b> single alternated coal <b>discharge,</b> multi-round sequential coal <b>discharge</b> and multi-round alternated coal <b>discharge.</b> The geological conditions for different coal seams are different, and their capabilities are also different, thus, different coal <b>discharge</b> methods must be used, and the recovery of top coal is also varied.|$|R

Methods: The authors conducted a case-control study of 1039 patients experiencing rehospitalisation within 30 days of <b>discharge</b> and 981 non-rehospitalised patients matched on admission diagnosis, <b>discharge</b> disposition, and severity of illness.

Although <b>discharges</b> below which 50 percent of the suspended sediment was transported and <b>discharges</b> which transport the greatest suspended sediment (effective <b>discharge)</b> occurred relatively frequently, recurrence intervals for these <b>discharges</b> were relatively high when compared to data from other areas. Likewise, <b>discharges</b> below which 90 percent of the suspended sediment was transported were also relatively infrequent. In most cases, the recurrence interval of bankfull <b>discharge</b> was several times {{greater than that of}} the effective <b>discharge.</b> This is because floodplain formation appears to be due more to overbank deposition during large sediment-laden <b>discharges</b> than to lateral channel migration and point bar formation...|$|R
