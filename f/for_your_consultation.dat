I {{would like to}} {{sincerely}} thank Professor Agnes van Dyk of the University of Namibia for her guidance and words of encouragement during my studies, and for being a model in my academic life. I dedicate this Doctorate degree to you as a retirement gift, Prof! Thanks to Dr Marieta van der Vyver <b>for</b> <b>your</b> support. Thanks to all my friends and Aunt Susanna <b>for</b> <b>your</b> support during my orphanage times. Special thanks to Professor Marie Poggenpoel and Professor Chris Myburg.

Perhaps it was with an impulse to treat her {{impertinence}} as she {{would have done that}} of a dependant; but the old lady never forgot herself: she only shrugged her shoulders and said, with studied politeness, 'When I unfortunately interrupted <b>your</b> <b>consultation</b> with this eminent physician, it was {{to ask you a question}} regarding this English family.

60|$|In {{resuming}} <b>your</b> <b>consultations</b> <b>for</b> {{the general}} good {{you can not}} but derive encouragement from the reflection that the measures of the last session have been as satisfactory to your constituents as the novelty and difficulty of the work allowed you to hope. Still further to realize their expectations and to secure the blessings which a gracious Providence has placed within our reach will {{in the course of}} the present important session call for the cool and deliberate exertion of your patriotism, firmness, and wisdom.|$|R

40|$|It is {{with the}} {{greatest}} pleasure that I accepted your invitation to speak today, at <b>your</b> <b>consultation</b> day on public health policy here in Ireland.

60|$|In {{pursuing}} the various and weighty {{business of the}} present session I indulge the fullest persuasion that <b>your</b> <b>consultation</b> will be equally marked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country. In whatever belongs to my duty you shall have all the cooperation which an undiminished zeal for its welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both, and our best reward, if, by a successful administration of our respective trusts, {{we can make the}} established Government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens, and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence.|$|R

60|$|With {{regard to}} the {{government}} share of the crop of 1775-6, we observe by the dobeer's memorandum, recited in <b>your</b> <b>Consultations</b> of the 13th of May, 1776, {{that it was the}} established custom of the Tanjore country to gather in the harvest and complete the collections within the month of March, but that, for the causes therein particularly stated, the harvest (and of course the collection of the government share of the crop) was delayed till the month of March was over. We also observe that the Rajah was not restored to his kingdom until the 11th of April, 1776; and from hence we infer, that, if the harvest and collection had been finished at the usual time, the Nabob (being then sovereign of the country) would have received the full benefit of that year's crop.|$|R
