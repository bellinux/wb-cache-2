40|$|Let A be {{an exact}} category, that is, an extension-closed full {{subcategory}} of an abelian category. Firstly, we give some necessary and sufficient conditions for A to <b>have</b> <b>almost</b> split sequences. Then, we study when an almost split sequence in A induces an almost split sequence in an exact subcategory C of A. In case A <b>has</b> <b>almost</b> split sequences and C is Hom-finite Krull-Schmidt, this provides a necessary and sufficient condition for C to <b>have</b> <b>almost</b> split sequences. Finally, we show two applications of these results. Comment: 16 page...|$|R

5|$|The {{remains of}} the Muslim army once again sought refuge in Mineo, where Theodotus {{blockaded}} them and soon reduced them {{to the point of}} eating their horses and even dogs. When they heard of this reversal, the Arab garrison of Agrigento abandoned the city and retreated to Mazara. Thus, by the autumn of 829, Sicily <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> been cleared of the Muslim invaders.|$|E

5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} no desire {{for a change in}} the form of {{government}} among most Brazilians, the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état that <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator. PedroII had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not allow his ouster to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent {{the last two years of}} his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.|$|E

5|$|By July 1929 {{the last}} of the {{superstructure}} had been cleared, and Bremse was turned upside down using techniques developed on salvaging some of the destroyers. Compressors were then used to pump air into the hull and bring her to the surface, while she was supported by 9-inch wires attached to two floating docks anchored on her port shoreward side. The salvage teams <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> raised her when she suddenly toppled onto her side and then heeled over gradually during the night, settling onto the rocks inshore.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, fuel {{stocks were}} used by the armies, and were {{unavailable}} to farmers. This allowed horses to remain a key aspect of agriculture and transportation {{until the end of}} the war. After the war, farmers rapidly mechanized their operations. The Auxois and other draft breeds were quickly abandoned in favor of machines, and population numbers began to fall in the early 1950s and collapsed completely in the 1960s. By the 1970s, the Auxois <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> disappeared, although many villages in the breed's homeland retained a small number of mares for traditional competitions.|$|E
5|$|During {{his years}} of exile in Siberia, Piłsudski met many Sybiraks, {{including}} Bronisław Szwarce, who <b>had</b> <b>almost</b> become {{a leader of the}} January 1863 Uprising.

Local officials decided that as a Polish noble he was not entitled to the 10-ruble pension received by most other exiles.|$|E
