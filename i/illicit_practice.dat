40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} supernatural transformation in medieval English romance. It explores corporeal changes of humans transformed into animals, monstrous men, loathly ladies, {{as well as the}} transformative effects of death. However, transformations could also alter one’s identity and interior states of being. Transformation in these texts is revealed to affect the body as well as the spirit. This symbiotic relationship between outward body and interior spirit is first demonstrated between two separate persons, and progresses to become localized within the one body and the same soul. <b>Illicit</b> <b>practices</b> of magic as well as the supernatural, powers of the faery otherworld as well as divine might, initiate these transformations. While romance transformations occur through various sources, both licit and illicit, the authors and redactors of these romances consistently employ religious imagery or belief at moments of transformation. This engagement with religious precepts proves to be surprising and unorthodox. As such this thesis explores the relationship between religious belief and the politics of disenchantment...|$|R

This article {{examines}} these questions {{in the context of}} democratizing Indonesia by analyzing licit and illicit sources of Indonesian police financing {{and the ways in which}} <b>illicit</b> <b>practices</b> of extraction and accumulation reshape the structure of the state. Budgetary revenues are both deficient and poorly organized by the Indonesian police (POLRI), continuing practices of fiscal maladministration and rent seeking that defined Suharto's New Order. This article demonstrates how this legacy continues within today's police by illustrating how on- and off-budget financing both resources police work and feeds centralized patron-clientalism through an ethics of “dirty-money” that ultimately sees rents flow upwards to police leadership. However, as Indonesia's neoliberal style democratization fragments centralized patronage into a shifting and unstable patron-clientalism, established patterns of rent accumulation and circulation and the moral-legal regimes that support them break down. In an uncertain environment, officers of all ranks canvass the political system, forming increasingly diverse networks that they hope will secure rents and their political future.
