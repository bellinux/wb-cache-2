5|$|After the Second Manchu {{invasion}} of Korea, Joseon <b>Korea</b> <b>was</b> {{forced to give}} several of their royal princesses as concubines to the Qing Manchu regent Prince Dorgon. In 1650, Dorgon married the Korean Princess Yishun/Uisun (義願). She was a collateral branch of the Korean royal family, and daughter of Yi Gae-yun (李愷胤). Dorgon married two Korean princesses at Lianshan.|$|E

The Japanese saw these marriages {{as a way to}} secure their colonial rule of Korea and introduce Japanese blood in to the Korean royal House of Yi.|$|E
25|$|Rice is {{the staple}} food of <b>Korea.</b> Having <b>been</b> an almost {{exclusively}} agricultural country until recently, the essential recipes in <b>Korea</b> <b>are</b> shaped by this experience. The main crops in <b>Korea</b> <b>are</b> rice, barley, beans and Gochujang (hot pepper paste), but many supplementary crops are used. Fish and other seafood {{are also important}} because <b>Korea</b> <b>is</b> a peninsula.|$|R

5|$|The US Army's 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, {{newly arrived}} in <b>Korea,</b> <b>was</b> {{moved to a}} road north of Hwanggan to block the North Korean People's Army's 2nd Division, {{advancing}} following the Battle of Taejon. In an unusually good first performance, the 27th Infantry was able to delay the North Korean division for almost a week, inflicting heavy casualties on it while suffering few casualties of their own.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Korea</b> <b>was</b> {{split into}} two {{separate}} countries, North and South, along the 38th parallel tensions {{between the two countries}} were worsened when other countries began to get involved on both sides. The communist country of North <b>Korea</b> <b>was</b> supported by Russia, China and others, while the democratic South was supported by the United Nations and the United States. In 1950 the United States got involved and {{over the next three years}} more than 1.5 million US service members would serve in Korea. During the three years of the war 133 Medals of Honor were presented and although more than 150,000 Jewish American men and women were serving in Korea at that time, not one received the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|American counterattacks {{continued}} into the morning of August 7, but the gains were slow, hampered by the hot weather {{and a lack of}} food and water. The North Koreans were able to press forward and regain the Cloverleaf Hill and Oblong-ni Ridge, critical terrain astride the main road in the bulge area. By 16:00 that day, the 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd US Infantry Division, a unit newly arrived in <b>Korea,</b> <b>was</b> sent to the region. Church immediately ordered it to attack the North Korean salient at the bulge. 9th Infantry was fresh and well-equipped. They were also inexperienced, many of their number being reservists. Despite a tenacious attack, the 9th Infantry was only able to regain part of Cloverleaf Hill before intense fighting stalled its movement.|$|E

5|$|Gyeongju {{emerged as}} a {{railroad}} junction in the later years of the Japanese Occupation, as the Donghae Nambu Line and Jungang Line were established {{in preparation for the}} Second Sino-Japanese War and to exploit the rich resources of {{the eastern part of the}} Korean peninsula. Following liberation in 1945, <b>Korea</b> <b>was</b> plunged into turmoil, and Gyeongju was no exception. Returnees from abroad were numerous; a village for them was constructed in present-day Dongcheon-dong. In a period marked by widespread conflict and unrest, the Gyeongju area became particularly notorious for the level of guerrilla activity in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the deployment, the division was sent to Fort Polk, Louisiana, to begin training and to fill its ranks. After its basic training was complete, the division was sent to Japan in April 1951 for advanced training and {{to act as a}} reserve force for the Eighth United States Army, then fighting in Korea. The involvement of the National Guard in the fighting in <b>Korea</b> <b>was</b> further expanded when the 40th Infantry Division of the California Army National Guard received warning orders for deployment as well.|$|E

5000|$|Media {{coverage}} of North Korea (officially the Democratic People's Republic of <b>Korea)</b> <b>is</b> hampered {{by a lack}} of reliable information. There are a number of reasons for this. Media access to the country is severely restricted. A key for information about North <b>Korea</b> <b>is</b> the testimony of defectors, but defectors are not necessarily reliable. Much information about North <b>Korea</b> <b>is</b> filtered through South Korea, but the longstanding conflict between the two countries distorts the information that is received.|$|R
5|$|Marjorie Gestring {{became the}} {{youngest}} Olympic champion ever {{at the age of}} 13, winning a gold medal in the women's 3 meter springboard. As <b>Korea</b> <b>was</b> under Japanese rule, Korean athletes who hoped to compete in the Games were required to qualify for the Japanese team. Sohn Kee-chung, competing as Kitei Son, won gold in the marathon, which made him Japan's first gold medalist at these Games and the first Korean ever to win a medal. His fellow countryman Nam Sung-yong won the bronze medal in the same event. For {{the first time since the}} 1908 Games, the United States failed to lead the medal table.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 2005, North Korea and South Korea held {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} possibility of sending a united team to the 2008 Olympics.

5|$|The Air Battle of South <b>Korea</b> <b>was</b> an air {{campaign}} {{early in the}} Korean War occurring roughly from June 25 to July 20, 1950, over South Korea between the air forces of North Korea and the United Nations, including the countries of South Korea, the United States and the United Kingdom. The month-long fight for air supremacy over the country saw several small engagements over airfields in Seoul and Taejon and ultimately ended in victory for the UN air force, which was able to destroy the small North Korean People's Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Damage in South <b>Korea</b> <b>was</b> {{estimated}} at $4.2billion (₩5.15trillion KRW). Damage was heaviest in Gangneung, where about 36,000homes and 622military buildings were flooded. At the airbase in Gangneung, floods submerged 16jet fighters. Along the coast, high winds damaged 640boats and about 200,000marine buildings, and 265industrial buildings were also damaged. The heavy rainfall left mudslides in the country, {{one of which}} covered ten cars in Gangneung. Flooding and the landslides disrupted the country's infrastructure; the storm destroyed 274bridges and damaged roads and rails at 164locations. Rusa killed 300,000livestock and flooded 85,000hectares (210,000acres) of crop fields, representing 6% of the country's agricultural lands, mostly affecting fruit and vegetables. The storm caused the Vana H Cup KBC Augusta golf tournament to end early, and a stadium {{to be used for}} the 2002 Asian Games was damaged. Across the country, 88,625people were forced to evacuate due to the typhoon, and 17,046houses were damaged. High winds left 1.25million people after blowing down 24,000power lines. There were 213deaths in the country, and another 33were missing and presumed dead; This made Rusa the deadliest typhoon in the country in more than 43years.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{armistice}} on 27July 1953, the squadron remained in South Korea on garrison duties—initially at Kimpo, later at Kunsan—until transferring to Iwakuni on 12October 1954. It departed for Australia on 19November and arrived in Sydney on 3December, having been based overseas for eleven years, {{a record for}} an RAAF unit. Its performance {{in the early days}} of the war has been cited as a factor in the United States' decision to ratify the ANZUS treaty in September 1951. The squadron's casualty rate in <b>Korea</b> <b>was</b> twenty-five percent killed or captured. Forty-one pilots died, thirty-five from the RAAF and six on exchange from the Royal Air Force. A further seven pilots became prisoners of war. Aircraft losses totalled almost sixty, including over forty Meteors, mostly to ground fire. The squadron flew 18,872 sorties, including 3,872 in Mustangs and 15,000 in Meteors. It was credited with shooting down five MiG-15s and destroying 3,700 buildings, 1,408 vehicles, ninety-eight railway engines and carriages, and sixteen bridges.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, with {{demobilisation}} of Australia's wartime army complete, {{the decision}} was made to re-raise the part-time forces of the Militia, albeit with the new name of the Citizens Military Force (CMF), and on a reduced establishment of two infantry divisions, an armoured brigade and various corps-level support units. During this time the 3rd Division was re-raised and based around a nucleus of three infantry brigades—the 4th, 6th and 9th Brigades—it was once again based in central Victoria, although subunits were also based in South Australia and Tasmania. Once again the division's component units bore little resemblance to those that had fought with it during the two World Wars. Service in the post war CMF was initially on a voluntary basis and recruitment remained poor until 1951 when conscription was introduced once again in an effort to improve the readiness of the Australian military during the Korean War. The 3rd Division was not deployed during this time, however, and although national service was instituted, service in <b>Korea</b> <b>was</b> undertaken on a voluntary basis, and conscription was used only as a means to expand the CMF and provide a base upon which mobilisation could be achieved if it proved necessary.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the US Army renamed its New York-based Ferryboat 84, a {{ferry boat}} that {{traveled}} to Governors Island in the Upper New York Bay, for Charlton. In September 1954, West Virginia renamed a bridge on the West Virginia Turnpike {{in honor of}} Charlton, the Charlton Memorial Bridge on Interstate 77. Charlton was also memorialized in the Bronx, with a park in the Morrisania area being named for Charlton in 1952, and in 1958 several gardens in Van Cortlandt Park in South Bronx were planted in his honor. These gardens are the site of annual Memorial Day gatherings of the local neighborhood where Charlton and other Bronx residents killed in the Korean War are honored. In 1993, a new barracks complex for US Forces Korea in South <b>Korea</b> <b>was</b> also named in Charlton's honor. In 2000, the United States Navy commissioned the USNS Charlton, a Watson-class vehicle cargo ship. Charlton's sister, Fairy M. Papadopoulos, served as the ship's co-sponsor.|$|E
