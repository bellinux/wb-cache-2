40|$|Background: Regarding {{the public}} health {{concerns}} {{over the use of}} food preservatives in yoghurt drink “Doogh", the aim of this study was the determination of sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate and natamycin in Doogh. Based on Iranian national standard, none of these preservatives are permitted to be used in Doogh. Methods: A total of 39 Doogh samples were analyzed through RP- HPLC in order to quantify sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate and natamaycin simultaneously. Exposure to each preservative is estimated by mean and maximum concentrations as the residue levels. The per capita Doogh consumption was calculated by the published data from official reports for Doogh annual production in Iran. Results: All samples were shown to contain sodium benzoate while natamaycin was detected in 10. 25 % of the samples and potassium sorbate was not detected in any of them. Sodium benzoate concentration extremely varied among the investigated samples ranged from 0. 94 to 9. 77 mg/l. Due to the result of the exposure estimation, no serious public health concern would exist regarding the mentioned preservatives. Conclusions: The detection of sodium benzoate in all Doogh samples could indicate the natural production of benzoic acid in yoghurt. Sodium benzoate may be formed through the interaction of the added <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> <b>salt</b> to the Doogh formula which contains benzoic acid. The results of exposure estimation show the lack of health risk within the usage of preservatives in spite of the national regulatory agencies does not permit the preservative use...|$|E

In Exp. 1 during the experimental period (d 0 to 14), pigs fed plasma had increased ADG and ADFI compared to pigs fed the control diet. Pigs fed the irradiated AP 920, as well as source 1 and source 2 regular (nonirradiated) <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> plasma had increased ADG compared to the control diet. Furthermore, pigs fed irradiated AP 920, regular AP 820, regular and irradiated source 1 <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> and regular source 2 <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> animal plasma had improved ADFI compared to pigs fed the control diet. No differences in F/G were observed between treatments. No differences were detected between pigs fed diets that contained irradiated plasma compared to those fed it in the regular form. For the overall experiment (d 0 to 24), pigs fed irradiated AP 920 had a tendency for improved F/G compared to pigs fed the control diet. In Exp. 2 during the experimental period (d 0 to 14), pigs fed diets containing plasma had improved ADG and F/G compared to pigs fed the control diet. Pigs fed irradiated AP 820 <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> plasma had higher ADG compared to pigs fed regular AP 820. For the overall experiment (d 0 to 24), pigs fed diets containing irradiated AP 820 had increased ADG, final body weight, and ADFI compared to pigs fed regular AP 820. Since irradiation of <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> plasma (low initial bacteria) did not improve growth performance while irradiation of feed grade plasma (initially high bacteria) improved performance, the initial bacteria level of animal plasma appears to influence growth performance of nursery pigs...|$|R
