Swarthy was blue-black in bright {{sunlight}} and would even follow the trucks, in the sky above, if the base-camp was moved to another location.|$|E
50|$|The {{voice is}} {{described}} as guttural croaks mixed {{with the sound of}} frog-call. Like all corvids, the <b>Fan-tailed</b> <b>raven</b> is capable of vocal mimicry, however this behavior is mostly recorded in captivity and, very rarely, in the wild.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fan-tailed</b> <b>raven</b> is {{completely}} black including bill, {{legs and feet}} and the plumage has a purplish-blue gloss in good light. Worn plumage is slightly coppery-brown. The base of the feathers on the upper neck are white and only seen if the bird is inspected or a strong gust blows them the wrong way. The throat hackles are shorter than in most other ravens.|$|E
50|$|The {{white-necked raven}} (Corvus albicollis) is {{somewhat}} smaller (50-54 cm in length) than the common raven or indeed its nearest relative, the thick-billed raven C. crassirostris. Like the common raven, thick-billed raven and brown-necked raven, {{it is one}} of the larger raven species. The smaller raven species are the Australian raven, forest raven, little raven, <b>fan-tailed</b> <b>raven</b> and Chihuahuan raven with the thick-billed raven being the world's largest raven species and the Chihuahuan raven being the smallest.|$|E

50|$|The <b>fan-tailed</b> <b>raven</b> (Corvus rhipidurus) is a {{passerine}} bird of {{the crow}} family native to Eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Like the Forest raven, Little raven, Australian raven and Chihuahuan raven, {{it is one}} of the smaller raven species. The larger species of raven are the Common raven, Thick-billed raven, White-necked raven and Brown-necked raven with the Common and Thick-billed ravens being the world's largest raven species and the Little and Fan-tailed ravens being the smallest, in fact it is about the same size or slightly larger than the carrion crow (47-51 cm) but with a much thicker bill, shorter tail and much larger wings.|$|E
50|$|The Chihuahuan raven (Corvus cryptoleucus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Corvidae that is native to the United States and Mexico. It was {{formerly}} known as the American white-necked raven, and has the proportions of a common raven with a heavy bill, but is about the same size as a carrion crow, or slightly larger than the American crow (44 - 51 cm long). The plumage is all-black with a rich purple-blue gloss in good light. Like the forest raven, little raven, <b>fan-tailed</b> <b>raven</b> and Australian raven, {{it is one of the}} smaller raven species. The larger species of raven are the common raven, thick-billed raven, white-necked raven and brown-necked raven, with the common and thick-billed ravens being the world's largest raven species and the little and fan-tailed ravens being the smallest. The Chihuahuan raven is very similar in appearance to the Australian raven, although with dark brown irises and whiter feather bases. The nasal bristles extend farther down the top of the bill than in any other Corvus species to about two-thirds the length. The base of the neck feathers are white-ish (seen only when ruffled in strong wind). The bill, legs and feet are black.|$|E
50|$|The {{brown-necked raven}} (Corvus ruficollis) {{is a larger}} bird (52-56 cm in length) than the carrion crow though not {{as large as the}} common raven. It has similar {{proportions}} to the common raven but the bill is not so large or deep and the wings tend {{to be a little more}} pointed in profile. The head and throat are a distinct brownish-black giving the bird its English name, while the rest of the plumage is black glossed with purple, blue or purplish-blue. Like the Common raven, Thick-billed raven and White-necked raven, it is one of the larger raven species. The smaller raven species are the Australian raven, Forest raven, Little raven, <b>Fan-tailed</b> <b>raven</b> and Chihuahuan raven with the Thick-billed raven being the world's largest raven species and the Chihuahuan raven being the smallest. The feathers of this species often fade quite quickly to a brownish black (even the truly black feathers) and the bird can look distinctly brown by the time it moults. The feet, legs and bill are black. The dwarf raven was formerly considered a subspecies (Corvus ruficollis edithae) but this bird now appears to be closer to the pied crow (C. albus) than this species.|$|E
