50|$|Most {{stations}} are located underground, with entrances/exits {{leading up to}} ground or street level. The bulk of the station typically positioned under land reserved for public thoroughfares or parks. Placing the station underground reduces the outside area occupied by the station, allowing vehicles and pedestrians to continue using the ground-level area {{in a similar way}} as before the station's construction. This is especially important where the station is serving high-density urban precincts, where ground-level spaces are already <b>heavily</b> <b>utilised.</b>|$|R

30|$|Metaphoric preaching is a {{traditional}} and powerful approach among teachings in Buddhist scriptures, and one which brings out insightful understandings of the more complex tenets (Cheng [2011] and Sugioka [2009]). In the Sūtra, metaphors are <b>heavily</b> <b>utilised</b> to explain prajñā (wisdom 般若) philosophy. One {{of these is the}} illustration of Vimalakīrti’s sickness and his ever-changing body. His sickness connotes anitya (impermanence 無常), and the non-autonomy of all beingscxiii, in which it is presented that the body will get sick, degenerate and diecxiv. Such a body is a phenomenal, delusive, and temporal bodycxv which should be let go of it. Sickness itself functions as a metaphor for a series of bondage – attachmentcxvi and entanglementcxvii that causes suffering.|$|R

Chapters 2 and 3 discussed changes in the historic land use patterns. Just what has this meant to the marine environments of the Gold Coast?

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} cost efficiencies on efficient management of branch networks in the contemporary European commercial banking industry. The analysis, which could be generalised to other industries, indicates that larger banks {{are more likely to}} have <b>heavily</b> <b>utilised</b> branch networks than smaller banks and to exhibit fewer cost efficiencies from building more branches. The finding of this result within each country suggests the role of internal firm size regardless of competitive conditions. The similar cross-country finding suggests the impact of factors such as market structure/concentration levels and type of non-price competition. Larger banks can generate less income per unit asset deployed. Cross-border efficiency might be improved by greater use of banks with under-used networks by banks with over-used networks.

50|$|The tunnel {{was built}} in the 1930s as part of the Farnborough Royal Aircraft Establishment cluster of tunnels. The tunnel was {{purchased}} by the University of Southampton for a minimal fee in 1979 on the understanding that they would cover the cost of transport and recommissioning at its new site on the Highfield Campus. This purchase was in response to a business case put forward at the time which focused around the need for more capacity to cope with increasing motorsport demand. Previously the 7x5 wind tunnel had been <b>heavily</b> <b>utilised</b> by many F1 teams and a larger facility was deemed desirable to increase model scales.

40|$|Abstract. Two-level λ-calculi {{have been}} <b>heavily</b> <b>utilised</b> for applica-tions such as partial evaluation, {{abstract}} interpretation and code gen-eration.

This is done {{in such a way}} as to conceal those differences between the systems that are not essential for the multi-level ideas (like whether or not one restricts the domain of the type environment to the free identi-fiers of the expression) and thereby to reveal the deeper similarities and differences. In their most general guise the multi-level λ-calculi allow multi-level structures that are not restricted to (possibly finite) linear orders and thereby generalise previous treatments in the literature. ...|$|R

40|$|Elephant {{impact on}} trees is of {{conservation}} concern in African savannas, but it???s effect on population size structure of <b>heavily</b> <b>utilised</b> species has received little attention. Although {{studies have shown}} that the population structure and density of Sclerocarya birrea subsp. caffra (marula), a <b>heavily</b> <b>utilised</b> savanna tree species, varies widely across its range, the causes of this variation are poorly understood. This study aimed to describe and compare these divergent structures and develop an understanding of the relationship between population structure and site characteristics, specifically disturbance. Four distinct groups of population structure were identified: (1) adult dominated populations consisting of only adults and no juveniles or seedlings. The size class distributions (SCDs) of this group were bell-shaped, indicating an unstable population which may have come about through circumstances that no longer occur in these areas, for example human settlement or a massive episodic recruitment event. High impala utilisation of seedlings or rodent seed predation are proposed to be the main cause of the lack of recruitment; (2) rotated sigmoid (or negative J shaped) curves, representing stable population structures, when protected from elephants, as well as at high rainfall sites with elephants, indicating that without elephants and in suitable habitats with elephants, marulas are able to attain a relatively stable size structure and instability is not inherent; (3) juvenile dominated populations with almost no adults. Adults are relegated to a few refugia, where elephants are unable to reach them; (4) juvenile dominated populations consisting of mostly juveniles and few adults. These populations, all exposed to fire and elephants, have ???missing size classes??? varying between 5 and 40 cm in stem diameter and 2 ??? 8 m in height. This unstable structure was most likely caused by fire suppression of juveniles combined with elephant utilisation of individuals in the ???missing size classes???. Consistent application of this pressure is postulated to result in the progression from stable to ???missing size class??? structure, to juvenile or adult dominated populations, and finally to local extirpation, with increasing elephant densities and concomitant utilisation, interacting with fire, rainfall and soil typ...|$|R
