40|$|Genomic changes {{occurring}} in the attenuated W- 2 strain of poliovirus 2 during persistent infection of {{the central nervous system}} of immunosuppressed mice were analyzed. The RNase T 1 oligonucleotide fingerprints of 34 different viruses, isolated from the brains and spinal cords of paralyzed and nonparalyzed mice during a 105 -day period, were used to quantitate and compare the mutations occurring <b>in</b> each <b>isolate.</b> Although mice were inoculated with plaque-purified virus, genetically distinct viruses were recovered from the central nervous system. The number of oligonucleotide changes occurring <b>in</b> <b>isolates</b> from paralyzed mice generally was greater than that observed <b>in</b> <b>isolates</b> from nonparalyzed mice. However, differences in the extent of mutation <b>in</b> <b>isolates</b> from the two groups of mice {{did not appear to be}} related to the level of virus replication. In paralyzed mice, the number of oligonucleotide changes on average was greater <b>in</b> viruses <b>isolated</b> during the first 60 days of the infection than in the last 45 days. The number of oligonucleotide changes was essentially constant throughout the infection, however, <b>in</b> viruses <b>isolated</b> from the brains of nonparalyzed mice.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the presence of virulence genes <b>in</b> <b>isolates</b> of CTX-M Escherichia coli from diseased chickens, from healthy chickens and from urinary tract infections in people. Three CTX-M E. coli strains from three different instances of disease in poultry (two of which were E. coli related) were tested for blaCTX-M sequence type and replicon type. Additionally, they were tested for the presence of 56 virulence genes (encoding fimbriae, adhesins, toxins, microcins and iron acquisition genes) using a micro-array. Results were compared to the virulence genes present <b>in</b> <b>isolates</b> from 26 healthy chickens and from 10 people with urinary tract infections. All genes found <b>in</b> <b>isolates</b> from diseased birds, including the astA (heat stable toxin) and tsh (temperature sensitive haemagglutinin) genes which have previously been associated with colibacillosis in chickens, were also present <b>in</b> <b>isolates</b> from healthy birds. However, 6 / 10 of the virulence genes found were exclusive to isolates from humans. Genes exclusive to chicken isolates included ireA (sidephore receptor), lpfA (long polar fimbriae), mchF (microcin transporter protein) and tsh whilst genes exclusive to human isolates included ctdB (cytolethal distending toxin), nfaE (non-fimbrial adhesion), senB (plasmid encoded enterotoxin) and toxB (toxin B). The results support previous findings that CTX-M E. coli strains in chickens are generally different from those causing disease in humans, but genes such as astA and tsh <b>in</b> <b>isolates</b> from diseased birds with colisepticaemia were also present <b>in</b> <b>isolates</b> from healthy bird...|$|R

40|$|A {{search for}} {{double-stranded}} RNA (dsRNA) was done <b>in</b> 18 <b>isolates</b> of the pathogenic basidiomycete Rhizoctonia solani (AG 2) isolated from Iranian sugar beet fields. Nucleic acids were extracted from freeze-dried mycelia and dsRNA separated by cellulose CF- 11 chromatography. The nature of dsRNA {{was confirmed by}} digestion with specific nuclease (RNase A). Electrophoretic bands of dsRNAs were detected on agarose gel in one to 10 Kb from eight isolates. The partial curing of dsRNA attempted to remove dsRNA by excising hyphal tips from PDA containing the cyclohexamide (75 ppm) and dsRNA removed from 4 isolates. Both the isolates associated with dsRNA and without dsRNA were studied in more detail. The isolates showed pronounced morphological changes, including increased mycelial growth <b>in</b> <b>isolates</b> 156, reduced virulence toward sugar beet <b>in</b> <b>isolate</b> 156, increased virulence <b>in</b> <b>isolate</b> 144, and decreased laccase activity <b>in</b> <b>isolates</b> 151, 156 and 144.

40|$|Background : Cell nanovesicles (NVs) {{are small}} (mostly nano-sized) membrane-enclosed cell {{fragments}} that are pinched {{off from the}} cell due to rearrangement of its constituents. We have determined concentration of NVs <b>in</b> <b>isolates</b> from blood <b>in</b> populations of patients with gastrointestinal cancer, patients with other gastrointestinal diseases and in healthy subjects. To study whether NVs derive from platelets, we considered correlations between the concentration of platelets in blood and the concentration of NVs <b>in</b> <b>isolates</b> from blood, and between vesiculability of platelets and concentration of NVs <b>in</b> <b>isolates</b> from blood. Methods : Blood samples were collected from 24 patients with gastrointestinal cancer, 28 patients with other gastrointestinal diseases and 49 healthy volunteers. NVs were isolated by centrifugation and washing of samples and counted by flow cytometry. Isolation was performed at 37  °C. Platelets were counted by impedance method. Populations were compared by methods of descriptive statistics. Results : In patients with gastrointestinal cancer the concentration of NVs <b>in</b> <b>isolates</b> from blood was considerably (44  %) and statistically significantly (p =  0. 0005) higher than in healthy subjects and considerably (34  %) and statsitically significantly (p =  0. 025) higher than in patients with other gastrointestinal diseases. There was no statistically significant correlation between the concentration of NVs <b>in</b> <b>isolates</b> from blood and the concentration of platelets in blood (r =  0. 1820, p =  0. 0801). We found a statistically significant positive correlation between vesiculability of platelets and concentration of NVs <b>in</b> <b>isolates</b> from blood (r =  0. 5690, p =  0, 0000).

40|$|The cell {{envelope}} {{amino acids}} of two moderately halophilic Bacillus isolates (BST and BSF) varied according to medium salinity. Cystine and proline were mostly effected. <b>In</b> both <b>isolates</b> growing <b>in</b> {{the presence of}} 6 and 18 % NaCl there were more dicarboxylic amino acids than basic amino acids which makes the cell envelope proteins quite acidic.

The two isolates contained glucosamine and muramic acid in their cell walls. The amounts of these two sugar derivatives, however, varied with the NaCl concentration. Thin-layer chromatography of phospholipids revealed the presence of cardiolipins, phosphatidylglycerols and phosphatidylethanolamines <b>in</b> the two <b>isolates</b> irrespective of medium salinity. Phosphatidylglycerols and the phosphatidylethanolamines increased on increasing the NaCl concentration of the growth medium. Lysophosphatidylglycerols were detected only in the 6 % grown BST cells.

40|$|Summary Objectives and hypothesis: This thesis {{concerns}} {{the study of}} plasmids of vancomycin- resistant enterococci isolated from feces of American crows in the years 2012 - 2013 period. The hypothesis is that, in various environments, there is one or more types of epidemiologically significant vanA gene-carrying plasmids {{that are capable of}} horizontally spread. Methods: Based on PFGE method the number and size of plasmids were detected <b>in</b> selected <b>isolates</b> of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Using PCR method the isolates were subjected to detection of genes of replicases, relaxases and toxin-antitoxin system of plasmid-bound resistance genes. Using 19 primers were characterized types of Tn 1546. Results: Of the 12 tested vancomycin-resistant isolates of E. faecium the following number and size of plasmids was proven using PFGE method: 2 isolates contained two plasmids (17 %), 3 isolates contained three plasmids (25 %), 5 isolates contained four plasmids (42 %) and 2 isolates contained five plasmids (17 %). All isolates (n = 12) were then subjected to the detection of genes of replicases, relaxases and toxin-antitoxin system for typing of plasmids from each plasmid families.
