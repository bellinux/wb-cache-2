5|$|The court enmities {{provoked}} by his twenty years unbroken intimacy and influence with the king, and the denigration of less gifted or less fortunate soldiers, followed him in death. Prince William expressed {{the bitterness of}} his hatred in almost <b>his</b> <b>last</b> <b>words,</b> and Prince Henry's memoirs give a wholly incredible portrait of Winterfeldt's arrogance, dishonesty, immorality and incapacity. Frederick, however, was not apt to encourage incompetence in his most trusted officers, {{and as for the}} rest, Winterfeldt stood first among the very few to whom the king gave his friendship and his entire confidence. On hearing of Winterfeldt's death, he said, I will never ever find again another Winterfeldt,and a little later, He was a good man, a soulful man; he was my friend. Winterfeldt's strength was thinking and acting strategically.|$|E
5|$|They {{arrived at}} the Andrew Johnson Hotel in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Carr {{requested}} a doctor for Williams, as he was feeling {{the combination of the}} chloral hydrate and alcohol he had drunk on the way from Montgomery to Knoxville. Dr. P.H. Cardwell injected Williams with two shots of vitamin B12 that also contained a quarter-grain of morphine. Carr and Williams checked out of the hotel; the porters had to carry Williams to the car, as he was coughing and hiccuping. At around midnight on Thursday January 1, 1953, when they crossed the Tennessee state line and arrived in Bristol, Virginia, Carr stopped at a small all-night restaurant and asked Williams if he wanted to eat. Williams said he did not, and those are believed to be <b>his</b> <b>last</b> <b>words.</b> Carr later drove on until he stopped for fuel at a gas station in Oak Hill, West Virginia, where he realized that Williams was dead. The filling station's owner called the chief of the local police. In Williams' Cadillac the police found some empty beer cans and unfinished handwritten lyrics.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} John James Sainsbury died in 1928, {{there were over}} 128 shops. <b>His</b> <b>last</b> <b>words</b> were said to be: 'Keep the shops well lit'. He was {{replaced}} by his eldest son, John Benjamin Sainsbury, who had gone into partnership with his father in 1915.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> was my name. A summons, {{to which}} I did not respond.|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>last</b> <b>word,</b> in {{striking}} {{contrast with the}} smoothness of his previous utterance, snapped like the lash of a whip. The cook quailed under it.|$|R

25|$|Alex's {{death on}} 6 September 2007, at age 31, {{came as a}} surprise, as the average life span for African grey parrots is sixty years. <b>His</b> <b>last</b> <b>words</b> ("You be good, see you tomorrow. I love you") were the same words that he would say every night when Pepperberg left the lab.|$|E
25|$|The {{words of}} Jesus on the cross, {{especially}} <b>his</b> <b>last</b> <b>words,</b> {{have been the}} subject of a wide range of Christian teachings and sermons, and a number of authors have written books specifically devoted to the last sayings of Christ. The difference between the accounts is cited by James Dunn as a reason to doubt their historicity.|$|E
25|$|Turambar {{decided to}} ambush the Dragon {{as he crossed}} the ravine of Cabed-en-Aras and to try {{stabbing}} him from beneath. He took two companions with him, Dorlas and Hunthor, but the first deserted them and the other was slain by a stone. Turambar mortally wounded Glaurung with Gurthang, but was hurt by the venom of the Dragon's blood and fell in a swoon. When Níniel came to search for him, Glaurung with <b>his</b> <b>last</b> <b>words</b> undid his spell, and she remembered who she was and realized that Turambar was her brother. Horrified, Nienor cast herself over the brink of the ravine into the river Taeglin and died.|$|E
5000|$|He died of {{pneumonia}} on 27 February 1930. <b>His</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> was [...] "Dictionary". In 1932 his widow, Elizabeth, published {{a biography of}} Wright, The Life of Joseph Wright.|$|R

60|$|As Mr Denham {{accompanied}} <b>his</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> with an inclination of {{the head}} which was equivalent to a dismissal, Mr Crumps sighed and retired to his den. His practical and unsuperstitious partner opened and read the letters.|$|R
25|$|When the {{proclamation}} for the apprehension of Avery {{and his crew}} reached Trott, {{he was forced to}} either put a warrant out for Avery's arrest or, failing to do so, effectively disclose his association with the pirate. Preferring the former choice {{for the sake of his}} reputation, he alerted the authorities as to pirates' whereabouts, but was able to tip off Avery and his crew before the authorities arrived. Avery's 113-person crew then fashioned their hasty escape, vanishing from the island with only twenty-four men ever captured, six of whom were executed. Avery himself was never seen again. <b>His</b> <b>last</b> <b>words</b> to his men were a litany of conflicting stories of where he planned to go, likely intended to throw pursuers off his trail.|$|E
25|$|A {{year after}} Vader's {{shocking}} revelation, Luke leads a rescue attempt to save Han from the gangster Jabba the Hutt. Afterward, Luke returns to Dagobah {{to complete his}} Jedi training, {{only to find the}} 900-year-old Yoda on his deathbed. In <b>his</b> <b>last</b> <b>words</b> Yoda confirms that Vader is Luke's father, Anakin Skywalker, and that Luke must confront his father again in order to complete his training. Moments later, the spirit of Obi-Wan reveals to Luke that Leia is his twin sister, but Obi-Wan also insists that Luke must face Vader again. As the Rebels lead an attack on the Death Star II, Luke engages Vader in another lightsaber duel as Emperor Palpatine watches; both Sith Lords intend to turn Luke to {{the dark side of the}} Force and take him as their apprentice.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and Gandhi Peace Foundation {{sponsored}} another {{conference in}} Patna, hosted by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Mahatma Gandhi's longtime right-hand disciple and first President of India. Prasad {{was supposed to}} speak at the conference but became ill, and Hills' guru Shantananda was leading prayers for him every day at the Sadaqat Ashram in Patna. Prasad requested to meet Hills, whose goals for World Union he had heard about from Nehru. Hills considered Prasad the most spiritual of the founders of Independent India, and their meeting was a profound encounter in which Prasad gave his blessing for Hills' global endeavors, but then the president lost consciousness, tightly holding onto Hills' hand. Apparently Prasad never recovered, and at the time, there was a controversy that the man who, through satyagraha, had resisted multiple British governments and Viceroys and been jailed by them for so many years, had said <b>his</b> <b>last</b> <b>words</b> to an Englishman.|$|E

60|$|That was <b>his</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> on the subject, and it prevailed {{by virtue}} of the {{authority}} they had vested in him, and of which he had taken so firm a grip. At daybreak Don Esteban and his followers were put off in a boat.|$|R
60|$|He {{seemed so}} laconic, so easy, so nice, {{that he could}} not have been taken seriously, yet Helen's quick {{perceptions}} registered a daring, a something that was both sudden and inevitable in him. <b>His</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> was as clear as the soft look he fixed upon Bo.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him for a moment without speech. Wrayson's features, more {{distinguished}} in a general way by delicacy than strength, had assumed a curiously set and dogged appearance.
