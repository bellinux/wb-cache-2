40|$|Problem statement: The {{extraction}} hoods {{commonly used}} as inlet {{element of the}} local ventilation systems exhibit limited emission capture over moderate distances from {{the source of the}} hazardous emissions. Proposed inclusion of a swirling peripheral jet was found to increase the effective length over which the extraction hood successfully captures harmful fumes. However information on a detailed pattern field of the vortex focused inflow was insufficient thus restricting the potential applications of the method. Approach: The numerical modeling study of the focusing by vortex inflow was accomplished to reveal the implication of the key operating parameters. In addition the visualization technique was applied to confirm the <b>fume</b> <b>capturing</b> features. Results: The simulated overall flow field patterns for an inflow of 10 m sec - 1 value under sets of 0. 5 - 1. 5 swirl numbers and 0 - 21 m sec - 1 outcome velocities of peripheral jet showed the arrangement and contour of the capture stream. Under optimum parameters the capture zone derived from the vector velocity field yielded up to 4 inlet diameters near-axis distance from the extractor entrance. The complimentary observations using laser sheet visualization technique confirmed the enhanced capturing capacity from the mist or smoke sources of emission. Conclusion: Through numerical modeling study the capacity of peripheral vortex shielding to generate the more concentrated exhaust inflow comparing with action of the conventional hood has been elucidated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFume and hygiene hoods {{are widely}} used to prevent {{fugitive}} emissions from charge ports, tap holes and many other openings in mineral processing and smelting vessels. The highly buoyant nature of the fume combined with often complex geometries {{make the design of}} these hoods difficult with traditional engineering tools. However, by combining the traditional engineering approach with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, a clear understanding of the shortfalls of an existing system can be obtained, and an optimised hood design can be achieved. This paper reports on a combined engineering and CFD analysis of a fume extraction system for a zinc slag fumer charge port. The engineering model revealed that the existing plant components (bag house and fan) were not capable of capturing the required amount of fume, and that the original hood design was flawed. The CFD model was then used to predict the <b>fume</b> <b>capture</b> and emission from the existing hood. CFD model predictions showed that increasing the draft flow rate by an order of magnitude would only give a marginal improvement in <b>fume</b> <b>capture.</b> Using findings of both the models enabled a new <b>fume</b> <b>capture</b> hood to be designed. CFD analysis of the new hood revealed that a significant improvement in <b>fume</b> <b>capture</b> is possible. Construction and installation of the hood has been performed and a 65 % reduction in fume emission was achieved, thus significantly mitigating a long-standing emission problem...|$|R
40|$|Capture of {{fugitive}} emissions from charge ports, tap holes {{and many other}} openings in mineral processing and smelting vessels poses a significant environmental and hygiene problem. While fume and hygiene hoods are often used the highly buoyant nature of the fume combined with complex geometries makes their design with traditional engineering tools difficult. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model {{has been used in}} conjunction with engineering modelling to predict <b>fume</b> <b>capture</b> and emissions from a zinc slag fumer charge port and five Pierce-Smith converters. Redesign of the slag fumer hood was found to be necessary after modelling showed substantial buoyancy in the fume meant that slots {{in the side of the}} hood are not adequate to ensure capture even at high airflow rates. Installation of the new hoods has reduced {{fugitive emissions}} by 65 %. Incremental improvements to <b>fume</b> <b>capture</b> from the Pierce-Smith copper converters via changes to operating procedures and minor modification to the plate were identified by the modelling approach. To ensure 100 % <b>fume</b> <b>capture</b> in most operating conditions a secondary hood was found to be necessary and a design has been proposed. Further investigations are currently underway, with implementation of a final solution expected shortly...|$|R

40|$|The {{building}} {{regulations of}} most countries require every kitchen {{to be provided}} with a window that opens into the external air. This alone is not an effective means for avoiding the contaminants generated during cooking from spreading into other parts of a residential flat. Many households equipped their kitchens with a range exhaust hood, with make up air drawn into the kitchen through an open window. Compared to other ventilation requirements in dwellings, the ventilation rate required for this purpose would be the highest, but would only need to be maintained for a relatively short time. The regulatory requirements pertaining to kitchen windows impose severe constraints on the layout design of buildings and increase the construction cost whilst {{the functions of the}} window can alternatively be fulfilled by the provision of artificial lighting and mechanical air supply and extraction systems. This paper reports the results of an experimental study on the capture efficiency of domestic kitchen exhaust hoods. The required parameters in a model for predicting the capture efficiency of such exhaust hoods were determined for application to typical Chinese cooking using a wok over a gas stove. The ventilation rate required for achieving satisfactory <b>fume</b> <b>capture</b> efficiency can then be determined, which is crucial to the design of the ventilation systems {{for the next generation of}} residential buildings with windowless kitchens.

40|$|This paper studied asphalt fume {{chemical}} composition, {{rheological properties}} and microstructure of asphalt with crumb rubber (CR) activated by microwave and trans-polyoctenamer (TOR). To that end, asphalt fume was trapped through laboratory <b>fume</b> generation and <b>capture</b> system, which was subsequently analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry system (GC-MS). Moreover, the rheological behavior and microstructure of CR modified asphalt (CRMA) {{were characterized by}} dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) and FTIR. The GC-MS results indicated that CR activated by microwave and TOR reduces the contents of PAHs and sulfur compounds, implying the lower toxicological potential of fume. TOR has the greater effect of reduction in the toxicological species. The rheological results indicated that CR activated by TOR significantly improves modulus, zero shear viscosity (ZSV), and recovery ability of CRMA at high temperatures, which cause asphalt binder having the stronger resistance to rutting. The enhancement in thermo-mechanics is due to chemical cross-linking among TOR, rubber, and asphalt, which was verified by FTIR results. On the other hand, microwave treatment on CR affects high temperature performance of CRMA negatively {{in comparison to the}} untreated CRMA. However, microwave treatment leads to the faster stress relaxation response of CRMA, indicating the stronger resistance to thermal cracking. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} airflow motions and associated pollutant distributions in fume hoods. Currently, most exhaust fume hoods are designed to use an airflow induced by a fan at the top to remove pollutants. Ambient fluids are drawn, flowing toward the opening and subsequently turning to the outlet at the roof. Pollutants are supposedly captured by the airflow and brought out from the cupboard. The present numerical study based on the finite-volume method and the standard k–e turbulence model simulates flow patterns and pollutant distributions in an exhaust fume hood with and without a manikin present. Subsequently, a push–pull air curtain technique is applied to a fume cupboard. To investigate the capturing performance of a push–pull fume cupboard, numerical approaches are used to simulate flow and concentration variations. Numerical results reveal that four characteristic flow modes exist for a variety of speed ratios of push–pull flows and openings. A concave curtain mode which has a fast pull flow and a weak push flow is suggested for the operation of a push–pull fume cup-board. According to ANSI-ASHRAE Standard 110 - 1995, the local concentration at the speci-fied point is < 0. 1 parts per million (p. p. m.). Meanwhile, we also examine concentration variations at 12 selected points in front of the sash, and all where the concentration is < 0. 1 p. p. m. A manikin is put in front of the sash to observe its effect. As a result, the flow and the concentration contours in a push–pull fume cupboard are not affected by a manikin. In terms of those predicted results, it turns out that a push–pull <b>fume</b> cupboard successfully <b>captures</b> pollutants and prevents an operator from breathing pollutants...|$|R
40|$|Nanotechnology, the {{manipulation}} of matter at a nanometer scale to produce new materials, structures, and devices having new properties, may revolutionize life in the future. It {{has the potential to}} impact medicine through improved disease diagnosis and treatment technologies and to impact manufacturing by creating smaller, lighter, stronger, and more efficient products. Nanotechnology could potentially decrease the impact of pollution by improving methods for water purification or energy conservation. Although engineered nanomaterials present seemingly limitless possibilities, they bring with them new challenges for identifying and controlling potential safety and health risks to workers. Of particular concern is the growing body of evidence that occupational exposure to some engineered nanomaterials can cause adverse health effects. As with any new technology or new material, the earliest exposures will likely occur for those workers conducting discovery research in laboratories or developing production processes in pilot plants. The research community is at the front line of creating new nanomaterials, testing their usefulness in a variety of applications and determining their toxicological and environmental impacts. Researchers handling engineered nanomaterials in laboratories should perform that work in a manner that protects their safety and health. This guidance document provides the best information currently available on engineering controls and safe work practices to be followed when working with engineered nanomaterials in research laboratories. Risk Management: Risk management {{is an integral part of}} occupational health and safety. Potential exposures to nanomaterials can be controlled in research laboratories through a flexible and adaptive risk management program. An effective program provides the framework to anticipate the emergence of this technology into laboratory settings, recognize the potential hazards, evaluate the exposure to the nanomaterial, develop controls to prevent or minimize exposure, and confirm the effectiveness of those controls. Hazard Identification: Experimental animal studies indicate that potentially adverse health effects may result from exposure to nanomaterials. Experimental studies in rodents and cell cultures have shown that the toxicity of ultrafine particles or nanoparticles is greater than the toxicity of the same mass of larger particles of similar chemical composition. Research demonstrates that inhalation is a significant route of exposure for nanomaterials. Evidence from animal studies indicates that inhaled nanoparticles may deposit deep in lung tissue, possibly interfering with lung function. It is also theorized that nanoparticles may enter the bloodstream through the lungs and transfer to other organs. Dermal exposure and subsequent penetration of nanomaterials may cause local or systemic effects. Ingestion is a third potential route of exposure. Little is known about the possible adverse effects of ingestion of nanomaterials, although some evidence suggests that nanosized particles can be transferred across the intestinal wall. Exposure Assessment: Exposure assessment is a key element of an effective risk management program. The exposure assessment should identify tasks that contribute to nanomaterial exposure and the workers conducting those tasks. An inventory of tasks should be developed that includes information on the duration and frequency of tasks that may result in exposure, along with the quantity of the material being handled, dustiness of the nanomaterial, and its physical form. A thorough understanding of the exposure potential will guide exposure assessment measurements, which will help determine the type of controls required for exposure mitigation. Exposure Control: Exposure control is the use of a set of tools or strategies for decreasing or eliminating worker exposure to a particular agent. Exposure control consists of a standardized hierarchy to include (in priority order) : elimination, substitution, isolation, engineering controls, administrative controls, or if no other option is available, personal protective equipment (PPE). Substitution or elimination is not often feasible for workers performing research with nanomaterials; however, it may be possible to change some aspects of the physical form of the nanomaterial or the process in a way that reduces nanomaterial release. Isolation includes the physical separation and containment of a process or piece of equipment, either by placing it in an area separate from the worker or by putting it within an enclosure that contains any nanomaterials that might be released. Engineering controls include any physical change to the process that reduces emissions or exposure to the material being contained or controlled. Ventilation is a form of engi-neering control that can be used to reduce occupational exposures to airborne particulates. General exhaust ventilation (GEV), also known as dilution ventilation, permits the release of the contaminant into the workplace air and then dilutes the concentration to an acceptable level. GEV alone is not an appropriate control for engineered nanomaterials or any other uncharacterized new chemical entity. Local exhaust ventilation (LEV), such as the standard laboratory chemical hood (formerly known as a laboratory <b>fume</b> hood), <b>captures</b> emissions at the source and thereby removes contaminants from the immediate occupational environment. Using selected forms of LEV properly is appropriate for control of engineered nanomaterials. Administrative controls can limit workers' exposures through techniques such as using job-rotation schedules that reduce the time an individual is exposed to a substance. Administrative controls may consist of standard operating procedures, general or specialized housekeeping procedures, spill prevention and control, and proper labeling and storage of nanomaterials. Employee training on the appropriate use and handling of nanomaterials is also an important administrative function. PPE creates a barrier between the worker and nanomaterials in order to reduce exposures. PPE may include laboratory coats, impervious clothing, closed-toe shoes, long pants, safety glasses, face shields, impervious gloves, and respirators. Other Considerations: Control verification or confirmation is essential to ensure that the implemented tools or strategies are performing as specified. Control verification can be performed with traditional industrial hygiene sampling methods, including area sampling, personal sampling, and real-time measurements. Control verification may also be achieved by monitoring the performance parameters of the control device to ensure that design and performance criteria are met. Other important considerations for effective risk management of nanomaterial expo-sure include fire and explosion control. Some studies indicate that nanomaterials may be more prone to explosion and combustion than an equivalent mass concentration of larger particles. Occupational health surveillance is used to identify possible injuries and illnesses and is recommended as a key element in an effective risk management program. Basic medical screening is prudent and should be conducted under the oversight of a qualified health-care professional. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "May 2012.
