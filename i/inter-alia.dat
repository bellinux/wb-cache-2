50|$|It {{may happen}} that a {{sensitivity}} {{analysis of a}} model-based study is meant to underpin an inference, and to certify its robustness, in a context where the inference feeds into a policy or decision making process.

The emphasis on the framing may derive <b>inter-alia</b> from the relevance of the policy study to different constituencies that are characterized by different norms and values, and hence by a different story about 'what the problem is' and foremost about 'who is telling the story'. Most often the framing includes more or less implicit assumptions, which could be political (e.g. which group needs to be protected) all the way to technical (e.g. which variable can be treated as a constant).|$|E

50|$|Water {{supply to}} the {{depressions}} in the park {{has become a major}} issue for preservation of biodiversity. This situation has arisen on account of construction of the Maga Dam about 25 km to the south of the park. Irrigation embankments have also been built along the Logone River, which resulted in poorer grasslands and total elimination of fisheries in some areas. This also resulted in drastic reduction of the antelope population. Under the Logone Project artificial waterholes were dug, providing water all through the year, but the carrying capacity of the floodplain has remained low.A study carried out on the effect of elephants on the survival of acacia trees discovered that the impact is not serious, but needs be monitored {{in order to ensure that}} the vegetation in the park is well conserved. The study stresses <b>inter-alia</b> the need to restore the hydrological balance of the Waza-Logone floodplain. Field studies carried out on the killings of lions by poachers in Waza park has indicated that only about 40 lions remain, and they may soon become extinct. One of the reasons attributed to this is inadequate patrolling. Though the IUCN prescribed a norm of one guard to 5000 ha of protected area, the eco-guards in the park number far less. This situation is now fairly addressed.|$|E
50|$|It {{seems that}} the {{question}} is not just failure to tell the truth, that determines the materiality of the statement. Even acts of a witness which obstructed proceeding during cross-examination, may be held to be material. In Millward, where a police officer denied having sought the assistance of his colleague in identifying in the court room a person charged with driving offences, that act was held by the English Court of Appeal as material statement in that it brought to a halt a line of cross-examination, went {{to the heart of the}} case, in that the stopping of the cross-examination might very have affected the outcome of the case. However, questions asked during cross-examination, which purpose is to impugn the credibility of a witness as to his previous convictions have been held not to be material. In R v Griepe, accused gave evidence on behalf of the Crown in 1970 on a preliminary objection into a charge of blackmail. The counsel to the alleged blackmailer asked the accused questions as to his credit with regard to his previous convictions between the year 1947 and 1950, which the accused denied but later admitted. The accused was subsequently charged with perjury relating to his evidence at the Magistrate Court in the proceedings for blackmail. The court <b>inter-alia</b> held that the answers given by the accused relating to those convictions not being relevant to those proceedings could not form the basis of a prosecution for perjury.|$|E
