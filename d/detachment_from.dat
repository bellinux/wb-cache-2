5|$|Taoism {{tends to}} {{emphasize}} various {{themes of the}} I Ching, the Tao Te Ching and Zhuangzi, such as naturalness, spontaneity, simplicity, <b>detachment</b> <b>from</b> desires, and most important of all, wu wei.

5|$|A {{detachment}} of four Australian F/A-18 Hornet fighter aircraft provided air defence for the US military {{base on the}} island of Diego Garcia during the campaign against the Taliban, which was called Operation Slipper. The initial detachment was provided by No. 77 Squadron RAAF between December 2001 and 10 February 2002. This detachment was replaced by a <b>detachment</b> <b>from</b> No. 3 Squadron RAAF which was deployed between 10 February 2002 and 20 May 2002. No further Australian units have been deployed to Diego Garcia. The United States Air Force commented favourably on the RAAF contingent's professionalism during this deployment.|$|E
5|$|A {{receiving}} station was formed from the immobile sections of light horse and mounted rifle brigades' field ambulances, a section from the 1/1st Welsh and the 157th Indian Field Ambulances with an operating unit, the Anzac Field Laboratory, and a <b>detachment</b> <b>from</b> an Egyptian hospital.

5|$|According to Francis Buchanan, 15,000 of them {{returned}} to Mangalore and its environs, whilst 10,000 of them migrated to Malabar. The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency (1883) mentions that 15,000 persons returned, of whom 12,000 were from South Canara and 3,000 from North Canara. According to the Mangalorean Catholic genealogist Michael Lobo, the present Mangalorean Catholic community is descended almost entirely {{from the small}} group of survivors who {{returned to}} South Canara. Soon after the death of Tipu, a <b>detachment</b> <b>from</b> the Bombay army under Lieutenant-Colonel Wiseman took possession of Mangalore on 4 June 1799, as well as the entire province of Canara, {{with the exception of the}} fortress of Jamalabad.|$|E

5|$|According to flashbacks {{during the}} game, Squall {{grew up in}} an orphanage with the other playable {{characters}} (except Rinoa). The orphans were cared for by Edea; although Squall remembers little about his past, he becomes an emotionally detached, cynical and introverted boy whose original goal is to go through life without any emotional ties or dependence. He gradually warms, and it is later revealed that his <b>detachment</b> <b>from</b> his companions is a defensive mechanism to protect himself from the emotional pain he suffered when he and his older sister were separated.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde {{reflects}} a more humorous world-view than Boccaccio's poem. Chaucer {{does not have}} his own wounded love to display and therefore allows himself an ironic <b>detachment</b> <b>from</b> events and Criseyde is more sympathetically portrayed. In contrast to Boccaccio's final canto, which returns to the poet's own situation, Chaucer's palinode has Troilus looking down laughing from heaven, finally aware of the meaninglessness of earthly emotions. About {{a third of the}} lines of the Troilus are adapted from the much shorter Il Filostrato, leaving room for a more detailed and characterised narrative.|$|E
5|$|In 1783, the 52nd {{arrived in}} Madras, {{for nine years}} of war {{spanning}} the Second and Third Anglo-Mysore Wars. The Second War had begun in 1778, when the British responded to news of war against France by moving against French-held bases in India. Hyder Ali, then ruler of Mysore, sided with the French and marched against the British. Hyder died in 1782, and was succeeded by his son, Tippu Sultan, who continued the war through some minor campaigns until a peace treaty was signed in 1784. Shortly afterwards, a <b>detachment</b> <b>from</b> the 52nd {{took part in the}} 1785 siege of Cannanore. The 52nd stormed the breach at Cannanore, under command of Sir Martin Hunter.|$|E

5|$|On 30 November Major J.G. Rees of the 25th Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers {{had only}} 60 men to hold Beit Ur el Foqa when the post was almost surrounded. They managed {{to break out}} of the {{position}} and joined the support company of the 10th Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry covering Et Tire and facing Signal Hill, which became the focus of the next Ottoman attack. This came at 14:30 when they attacked with 400 soldiers, driving the <b>detachment</b> <b>from</b> Signal Hill. This move made Et Tire untenable and forced the 10th King's Shropshire Light Infantry to fall back to its original line.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December 1941, No. 6 Commando, {{along with}} a <b>detachment</b> <b>from</b> No. 12 Commando and some Norwegian soldiers, took part in Operation Kitbag, a raid on the town of Florø in Norway.

During the voyage an incident occurred {{while some of the}} men were priming grenades for the raid which resulted in six men being killed and another 11 seriously wounded. Nevertheless, {{the decision was made to}} continue with the raid, although it was eventually called off when the naval commander was unable to locate the fjord upon which Florø was located due to navigational difficulties.|$|E

The Marine Corps stationed 19 Douglas SBD Dauntless, 7 F4F-3 Wildcats, 17 Vought SB2U Vindicators, and 21 Brewster F2A Buffalos.
