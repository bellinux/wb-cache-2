According to the American historian Edmund Burke, al-Qassam was:An individual deeply imbued with the Islamic social gospel and who was struck by the plight of Palestinian peasants and migrants. Al-Qassam's pastoral concern was linked to his moral outrage as a Muslim at {{the ways in which the}} old implicit social compact was being violated in the circumstances of British mandatory Palestine. This anger fueled a political radicalism that drove him eventually to take up arms and marks him off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> notable politicians.|$|E
5|$|Prince Sadruddin's {{determination}} not {{to discriminate}} between European and Third World refugees helped prepare the UNHCR {{for a change in}} the landscape of internationally displaced persons. During the 1950s, between 200,000 and 300,000 refugees of European origin required assistance. By the 1970s the European refugee problems were mostly solved, but had been replaced by millions of displaced persons in the Third World. He had widened the UNHCR mandate well beyond its original focus on Eastern Europe, extending the organisation's reach to refugees <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> territory, Vietnam, Angola and Algeria. As the scale and complexity of refugee issues continued to increase, the UNHCR and the international community at large was better positioned to adapt. By the end of 1977 when he chose to step down from the position, he had become the longest-serving UN High Commissioner for Refugees. He continued to serve in various capacities dealing with humanitarian situations on behalf of the UN.|$|E

25|$|The {{policy of}} the Government of Israel is to {{condition}} the access of Palestinians {{who live in the}} Palestinian territories to healthcare in Israel upon financial coverage <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Authority. In January 2009, following the war, the Palestinian Authority cancelled financial coverage for all medical care for Palestinians in Israeli hospitals, including coverage for chronically ill Palestinian patients, and those in need of complex care that is not available in other tertiary medical centers in the region.

25|$|Based on the Israeli {{definition}} of the West Bank, Barak offered to form a Palestinian state initially on 73% of the West Bank (that is, 27% less than the Green Line borders) and 100% of the Gaza Strip. In 10–25 years, the Palestinian state would expand {{to a maximum of}} 92% of the West Bank (91 percent of the West Bank and 1 percent from a land swap). <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> perspective this equated to an offer of a Palestinian state on a maximum of 86% of the West Bank.|$|E
25|$|He {{supported}} the Palestinians {{in their struggle}} against Israel for ideological reasons, but also to garner support <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> fedayeen based in Lebanon's refugee camps. The presence in Lebanon {{of large numbers of}} Palestinian refugees was resented by most Christians, but Jumblatt strived to build a hard core of opposition around the Arab nationalist slogans of the Palestinian movement. Demanding a new Lebanese order based on secularism, socialism, Arabism and an abolition of the sectarian system, Jumblatt began gathering disenchanted Sunnis, Shi'a and leftist Christians into an embryonic national opposition movement.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Jewish {{immigration}} to Palestine met little opposition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> Arabs. However, as anti-Semitism grew in Europe {{during the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, Jewish immigration (mostly from Europe) to Palestine began to increase markedly. Combined {{with the growth of}} Arab nationalism in the region and increasing anti-Jewish sentiments the growth of Jewish population created much Arab resentment. The British government placed limitations on Jewish {{immigration to}} Palestine. These quotas were controversial, particularly in the latter years of British rule, and both Arabs and Jews disliked the policy, each for their own reasons.|$|E

25|$|With {{the aim of}} marginalising the settlers' {{more militant}} wing, Barak courted {{moderate}} settler opinion, securing agreement for the dismantlement of 12 new outposts that had been constructed since the Wye River Agreement of November 1998, but the continued expansion of existing settlements with plans for 3,000 new houses in the West Bank drew strong condemnation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> leadership. Though construction within existing settlements was permitted under the Oslo agreements, Palestinian supporters contend that any continued construction was contrary to its spirit, prejudiced the outcome of final status negotiations, and undermined Palestinian confidence in Barak's desire for peace.|$|E
