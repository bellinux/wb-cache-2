Integrating these two strands of literature, we examine whether managerial practices explain this relationship using data from UK firms during 1992 – 2014.

During the post-crisis period, higher intangibles are only beneficial when combined with R&D activity. Also firms with better managerial practices and innovative activities exhibit a positive effect of higher leverage. Finally, an inverse U-shaped result supports the Schumpeterian theory of creative destruction...|$|R

30|$|The above results {{indicate}} that favorable sibling sex composition is <b>equally</b> <b>beneficial</b> for men and women, but disadvantageous sibling sex composition only adversely affects women and does not affect men. Therefore, the effects of sibling sex composition are not simply {{a greater impact on}} women’s education, but also have complex gender heterogeneity, a result that differs from Chu and his colleagues’ observations (Chu et al. 2007). However, this again precisely proves that sibling sex composition matters because of the strong son preference and budget constraints faced by Chinese families. When the household is more budget-constrained because of disadvantageous sibling sex composition, parents start by reducing the investment in education for girls, thus leading to an asymmetric impact of sibling sex composition between genders.|$|R
