40|$|The highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>virus</b> phenotype {{is restricted to}} influenza A viruses of the H 5 and H 7 hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes. To obtain {{more information on the}} apparent subtype-specific nature of the <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> phenotype, a low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H 6 N 1 virus was generated, containing an HPAI H 5 RRRKKR↓G multibasic cleavage site (MBCS) motif in HA (the downward arrow indicates the site of cleavage). This insertion converted the LPAI virus phenotype into an <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> phenotype in vitro and in vivo. The H 6 N 1 virus with an MBCS displayed in vitro characteristics similar to those of <b>HPAI</b> H 5 <b>viruses,</b> such as cleavage of HA 0 (the HA protein of influenza A virus initially synthesized as a single polypeptide precursor) and virus replication in the absence of exogenous trypsin. Studies of chickens confirmed the HPAI phenotype of the H 6 N 1 virus with an MBCS, with an intravenous pathogenicity index of 1. 4 and systemic virus replication upon intranasal inoculation, the hallmarks of <b>HPAI</b> <b>viruses.</b> This study provides evidence that the subtypespecific nature of the emergence of <b>HPAI</b> <b>viruses</b> is not at the molecular, structural, or functional level, since the introduction of an MBCS resulted in a fully functional <b>virus</b> with an <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> genotype and phenotype.

40|$|Low {{pathogenicity}} {{avian influenza}} A strains (LPAI) of the H 5 and H 7 type are noted {{for their ability}} to transform into highly pathogenic counterparts (HPAI). Here we compare the transmission characteristics in poultry of LPAI H 5 N 2 (A/Chicken/Pennsylvania/ 83) and corresponding <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> by means of transmission experiments. In the experiments, five inoculated animals are placed in a cage with five contact animals, and the infection chain is monitored by taking blood samples, and samples from the trachea and cloaca. The data are analysed by final size methods and a generalized linear model. The results show that <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> is more infectious and induces a longer infectious period than LPAI. In fact, fully susceptible animals are invariably infected when confronted with <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> and die within six days after infection. Animals previously infected with LPAI virus, on the other hand, survive an infection with <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> or escape infection all together. This implies that a previous infection with LPAI virus effectively reduces susceptibility of the host to infection and decreases transmission of <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus.</b> We discuss the implications of these conclusions for the control and evolution of avian influenza viruses...|$|R

40|$|Wild {{birds in}} the Orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes are the natural {{reservoirs}} for avian influenza (AI) viruses. Although they are often infected with multiple AI viruses, the significance and extent of acquired immunity in these populations is not understood. Pre-existing immunity to AI virus {{has been shown to}} modulate the outcome of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>virus</b> infection in multiple domestic avian species, but few studies have addressed this effect in wild birds. In this study, the effect of pre-exposure to homosubtypic (homologous hemagglutinin) and heterosubtypic (heterologous hemagglutinin) low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses on the outcome of a H 5 N 1 <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> infection in wood ducks (Aix sponsa) was evaluated. Pre-exposure of wood ducks to different LPAI viruses did not prevent infection with H 5 N 1 <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus,</b> but did increase survival associated with H 5 N 1 <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> infection. The magnitude of this effect on the outcome of the H 5 N 1 <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> infection varied between different LPAI viruses, and was associated both with efficiency of LPAI viral replication in wood ducks {{and the development of a}} detectable humoral immune response. These observations suggest that in naturally occurring outbreaks of H 5 N 1 HPAI, birds with pre-existing immunity to homologous hemagglutinin or neuraminidase subtypes of AI virus may either survive H 5 N 1 <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> infection or live longer than naïve birds and, consequently, could pose a greater risk for contributing to viral transmission and dissemination.

40|$|Low {{pathogenicity}} {{avian influenza}} (LPAI) viruses of the H 7 subtype generally cause mild disease in poultry. However {{the evolution of}} a LPAI virus into highly pathogenic avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>virus</b> results in the generation of a virus that can cause severe disease and death. The classification of these two pathotypes is based, in part, on disease signs and death in chickens, as assessed in an intravenous pathogenicity test, but the effect of LPAI viruses in turkeys is less well understood. During an investigation of LPAI virus infection of turkeys, groups of three-week-old birds inoculated with A/chicken/Italy/ 1279 / 99 (H 7 N 1) showed severe disease signs and died or were euthanised within seven days of infection. Virus was detected in many internal tissues and organs from culled birds. To examine the possible evolution of the infecting virus to a highly pathogenic form in these turkeys, sequence analysis of the haemagglutinin (HA) gene cleavage site was carried out by analysing multiple cDNA amplicons made from swabs and tissue sample extracts employing Sanger and Next Generation Sequencing. In addition, a RT-PCR assay to detect <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> was developed. There was no evidence of the presence of <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> in either the virus used as inoculum or from swabs taken from infected birds.

All species were infected, but only wood ducks (Aix sponsa) and laughing gulls exhibited illness or died. Viral titers were higher in oropharyngeal swabs than in cloacal swabs. Duration of viral shedding (1 – 10 days) increased with severity of clinical disease. Both the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) and agar gel precipitin (AGP) tests were able to detect postinoculation antibodies in surviving wood ducks and laughing gulls; the HI test was more sensitive than the AGP in the remaining 4 species. Free-living birds in the orders Anseriformes (ducks, geese, swans) and Charadriiformes (gulls, terns, shore birds) have traditionally been considered the natural reservoirs for avian influenza viruses (AIVs) (1, 2). However, before 2005, no evidence showed that highly pathogenic avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>viruses</b> were maintained in wild bird populations.

However, {{details on the}} cellular proteases involved in this event are not fully available. We report here that ubiquitous type II transmembrane serine proteases, MSPL and its splice variant TMPRSS 13, are novel candidates for proteases processing HA proteins of highly pathogenic avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>viruses,</b> apart from the previously identified furin and proprotein convertases 5 and 6. HAs from all <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> H 5 and H 7 strains have one of two cleavage site motifs, the R-X-K/R-R motif with R at position P 4 and the K-K/R-K/T-R motif with K at position P 4. In studies of synthetic 14 -residue <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> HA peptides with these cleavage site motifs, furin preferentially cleaved only HA peptides with the R-K-K-R motif {{in the presence of}} calcium and not peptides with the other motif, whereas MSPL and TMPRSS 13 cleaved both types of HA peptides (those with the R/K-K-K-R motif) efficiently in the absence of calcium. Full-length recombinant <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> HA with the K-K-K-R cleavage motif exhibited poor susceptibility to cleavage in the absence of MSPL or TMPRSS 13 and the presence of furin in infected cells, but it was converted to mature HA subunits in transfected cells expressing MSPL or TMPRSS 13, with membrane-fused giant-cell formation.

40|$|International audienceAbstractIn late 2014, a H 5 N 8 highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>virus,</b> clade 2. 3. 4. 4, spread by migratory waterfowl into North America reassorting with low pathogenicity AI viruses {{to produce a}} H 5 N 2 <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus.</b> Since domestic waterfowl are common backyard poultry frequently in contact with wild waterfowl, the infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity of the United States H 5 <b>HPAI</b> index <b>viruses</b> (H 5 N 8 and H 5 N 2) was investigated in domestic ducks and geese. Ducks infected with the viruses had an increase in body temperature but no or mild clinical signs. Infected geese did not show increase in body temperature and most only had mild clinical signs; however, some geese presented severe neurological signs. Ducks became infected and transmitted the viruses to contacts when inoculated with high virus doses [(104 and 106 50 % embryo infective dose (EID 50) ], but not with a lower dose (102 EID 50). Geese inoculated with the H 5 N 8 virus became infected regardless of the virus dose given, and transmitted the virus to direct contacts. Only geese inoculated with the higher doses of the H 5 N 2 and their contacts became infected, indicating differences in infectivity between the two viruses and the two waterfowl species. Geese shed higher titers of virus and {{for a longer period}} of time than ducks. In conclusion, the H 5 <b>HPAI</b> <b>viruses</b> can infect domestic waterfowl and easily transmit to contact birds, with geese being more susceptible to infection and disease than ducks. The disease is mostly asymptomatic, but infected birds shed virus for several days representing a risk to other poultry species...|$|R
40|$|Endotheliotropism is a {{hallmark}} of gallinaceous poultry infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>viruses</b> and a feature that distinguishes HPAI from low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. Here, we used chicken aortic endothelial cells (chAEC) as a novel in vitro infection model to assess the susceptibility, permissiveness, and host response of chicken endothelial cells (EC) to infections with avian influenza (AI) viruses. Our data show that productive replication of AI viruses in chAEC is critically determined by hemagglutinin cleavability, and is thus an exclusive trait of <b>HPAI</b> <b>viruses.</b> However, we provide evidence for a link between limited (i. e. trypsin-dependent) replication of certain LPAI viruses, and the viruses’ ability to dampen the antiviral innate immune response in infected chAEC. Strikingly, this cell response pattern was also detected in HPAI virus-infected chAEC, suggesting that viral innate immune escape might be a prerequisite for robust AI virus replication in chicken EC...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDespite {{continuing}} research efforts, {{knowledge of}} the transmission of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>virus</b> still has considerable gaps, which complicates epidemic control. The goal {{of this research was}} to develop a model to back-calculate the day <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> is introduced into a flock, based on within-flock mortality data. The back-calculation method was based on a stochastic SEIR (susceptible (S) - latently infected (E) - infectious (I) - removed (= dead; R)) epidemic model. The latent and infectious period were assumed to be gamma distributed. Parameter values were based on experimental H 7 N 7 within-flock transmission data. The model was used to estimate the day of virus introduction based on a defined within-flock mortality threshold (detection rule for determining AI). Our results indicate that approximately two weeks can elapse before a noticeable increase in mortality is observed after a single introduction into a flock. For example, it takes twelve (minimum 11 - maximum 15) days before AI is detected if the detection rule is fifty dead chickens on two consecutive days in a 10 [*] 000 chicken flock (current Dutch monitoring rule for notification). The results were robust for flock size and detection rule, but sensitive to the length of the latent and infectious periods. Furthermore, assuming multiple introductions on one day will result in a shorter estimated period between infection and detection. The implications of the model outcomes for detecting and tracing outbreaks of H 7 N 7 <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Duck {{populations are}} {{considered}} to be a reservoir of Highly pathogenic avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>virus</b> H 5 N 1 in some agricultural production systems, as they are able to shed the virus for several days without clinical signs. Countries endemically affected with HPAI in Asia are characterised by production systems where ducks are fed on post-harvest spilled rice. During this scavenging process it is common for ducks to come into contact with other duck flocks or wild birds, thereby providing opportunities for virus spread. Effective risk management for HPAI has been significantly compromised by a limited understanding of management of moving duck flocks in these countries, despite of a small number of recent investigations. Here, for the first time, we described the management of moving duck flocks and the structure of the moving duck flock network in quantitative terms so that factors influencing the risk of HPAIV transmission can be identified. By following moving duck flock farmers over a period of 6 months in Java, Indonesia, we were able to describe the movement of flocks and to characterise the network of various types of actors associated with the production system. We used these data to estimate the basic reproductive number for <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> spread. Our results suggest that focussing HPAI prevention measures on duck flocks alone will not be sufficient. Instead, the role of transporters of moving duck flocks, hatcheries and rice paddy owners, in the spread of the <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> needs to be recognised...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{outbreaks}} of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) have spread from southeast Asia to 62 Eurasian and African countries. H 5 N 1 viruses isolated from dead water birds in Mongolia {{on the way}} back to their nesting areas in Siberia in April to May in 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009 were genetically closely related to those isolated from birds in China, and some southeast Asian countries. It is now a serious concern that these <b>HPAI</b> <b>viruses</b> may perpetuate in the lakes where migratory water birds nest in summer. Therefore, virological surveillance of avian influenza virus in the migratory birds that fly from their nesting lakes in Siberia to Hokkaido, Japan was carried out in autumn every year. During 2008 - 2009, 62 influenza viruses of 21 different combinations of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were isolated. Up to September 2010, no <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> has been found, indicating that H 5 N 1 <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> has not perpetuated at least dominantly in the lakes where ducks nest in summer in Siberia. It is reported that the PB 2 protein is a component of the viral polymerase complex that plays an important role in virus replication, and is a determinant of host range and pathogenicity of influenza viruses. The PB 2 genes of 57 influenza viruses out of 283 influenza viruses isolated in Hokkaido in 2000 - 2009 were phylogenetically analysed. None of the genes showed close relation to those of H 5 N 1 <b>HPAI</b> <b>viruses</b> that were detected in wild birds found dead in Eurasia {{on the way back}} to their northern territory in spring. Avian influenza virus strains isolated from migratory ducks in the global surveillance have been stored for the use for vaccines and diagnosis. Vaccine is used to reduce virus shedding into the environment and as an optional measure in cases where the disease spreads widely, in addition to stamping out. In the present study, the efficacy of the vaccine was comparable to that prepared from genetically modified <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> strain ΔRRRRK rg-A/whooper swan/Mongolia/ 3 / 2005 (H 5 N 1), which is more antigenically related to the challenge virus strain, in chickens. Inactivated influenza virus vaccine prepared from a non-pathogenic influenza virus strain A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac- 1 / 2004 (H 5 N 1) from the virus library conferred protective immunity to chickens against the challenge of antigenically drifted <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus,</b> A/whooper swan/Hokkaido/ 1 / 2008 (H 5 N 1). 2005 年以後、毎年春にユーラシアの各地でH 5 N 1 高病原性鳥インフルエンザウイルス（HPAIV）に感染し、斃死した野生水禽が見つかっている。南中国を含む東南アジアの越冬地でウイルスに感染し、北方圏の営巣湖沼に辿り着く前に斃死したものである。中には、シベリアの営巣湖沼までウイルスを持ち込む水禽もいるに違いない。もし、このHPAIV が、営巣湖沼に定着して優勢になれば、毎年秋に渡り鳥がHPAIV を運んでくる恐れがある。これをモニターするために、北海道大学OIE Reference library for Animal Influenza では、毎年秋に北海道稚内市と札幌の湖沼にシベリアから飛来する渡り水禽の疫学調査を実施している。本研究では、 2008 ～ 2009 年に、 21 の異なる亜型から成る 62 株のインフルエンザウイルスが分離された。HPAIV は検出されなかった。 1991 年から本研究を含め 19 年間、毎年秋にシベリアからモンゴルおよび北海道に飛来した野生水禽の糞便 22, 744 検体から分離された 795 株のインフルエンザA ウイルスの中に、HPAIV は検出されていない。この背景があったため、 2010 年 10 月 14 日に稚内市大沼に飛来したカモの糞便 183 検体から 2 株のH 5 N 1 HPAIV が分離された際には、直ちに国内の野鳥と家禽の疫学検査の強化を提案し、 11 月に島根県で家禽および 12 月に富山、鳥取と鹿児島で野鳥のウイルス感染が早期に検出され、的確に対応することができた。 2000 年から 2009 年までに北海道で分離されたウイルス 452 株の中から 57 株を選び、これらのPB 2 遺伝子を解析した。 2005 年以来、春にユーラシアで斃死した野生水禽から分離されたH 5 N 1 HPAIV のそれらと近縁のものはなかった。鳥インフルエンザ対策の基本は、感染の早期摘発と当該農場の全羽淘汰、周辺の家禽と生産物などの移動制限、ならびに管理衛生の徹底である。もし、発生・流行が拡大してこれらで対応することが困難な場合には、不活化ワクチンを使用することが選択肢の一つとして認められている。日本においては、斯かる不測の事態に備えて、家禽用H 5 N 1 ウイルスワクチンが備蓄されている。アジアにおけるH 5 N 1 HPAIV の感染・流行が治まらず、抗原性が異なる変異ウイルスが次々に 51 選択されている現状の下で、著者は、インフルエンザウイルスライブラリーに保管されている非病原性のA/duck/Hokkaido/Vac- 1 / 2004 (H 5 N 1) 株で調製した備蓄ワクチンを接種したニワトリが、抗原変異HPAIV、A/whooper swan/Hokkaido/ 2008 (H 5 N 1) 株の攻撃に耐えることを明らかにした。さらに、その免疫原性は、モンゴルで斃死したオオハクチョウから分離された、攻撃株の抗原性とより近縁なH 5 N 1 HPAIV をreverse genetics とsite-directed mutagenesis によって弱毒化した、RRRRK rg-A/whooper swan/Mongolia/ 3 / 2005 (H 5 N 1) 株で調製したワクチンのそれと同等であることを実証した...|$|R

40|$|The poultry {{epidemic}} of H 7 N 7 highly pathogenic avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>virus</b> in the Netherlands in 2003 {{was probably the}} result of the introduction of an H 7 N 7 low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus (by interspecies transmission from wild birds) and the subsequent intraspecies transmission of this virus in poultry. The intraspecies transmission of the ensuing H 7 N 7 <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> was very successful both within and between flocks. Consequently, in the two poultry-dense areas that were affected, the epidemic could only be stopped by eliminating all poultry in the region.

40|$|AbstractThe direct {{transmission}} of highly pathogenic avian influenza (<b>HPAI)</b> <b>viruses</b> to humans in Eurasia and subsequent disease has sparked research efforts leading to {{better understanding of}} <b>HPAI</b> <b>virus</b> transmission and pathogenicity in mammals. There has been minimal focus on examining the capacity of circulating low pathogenic wild bird avian influenza viruses to infect mammals. We have utilized a mouse model for influenza virus infection to examine 28 North American wild bird avian influenza virus isolates that include the hemagglutinin subtypes H 2, H 3, H 4, H 6, H 7, and H 11. We demonstrate that many wild bird avian influenza viruses of several different hemagglutinin types replicate in this mouse model without adaptation and induce histopathologic lesions similar to other influenza virus infections but cause minimal morbidity. These findings demonstrate the potential of wild avian influenza viruses to directly infect mice without prior adaptation and support their potential role in emergence of pandemic influenza...|$|R

They showed similar replication in several organs and lethal outcome. However, on day 3 post-infection, Pigeon 04 induced mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL 6 and TNFα) and MIP- 2, neutrophil chemoattractant, in the lungs, resulting in severe pneumonia that was accompanied by neutrophil infiltration. In contrast, on day 7 post-infection, T. sparrow 05 induced the expression of several cytokines {{to a greater extent}} than Pigeon 04; it also potently induced mRNA expression of several cytokines in brains of the infected mice that triggered frequent inflammatory events. In sum, our study demonstrated that two <b>HPAI</b> <b>viruses</b> induced different host responses, despite having similar replications, resulting in lethal outcome in mice...|$|R
