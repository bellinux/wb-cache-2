Clioquinol (Entero-vioform) was noted as successful in treatment of Blastocystis infection but removed from the market following an adverse event in Japan. Stovarsol and Narsenol, two arsenic-based antiprotozoals, were reported to be effective against the infection. Carbarsone was available as an anti-infective compound in the United States as late as 1991, and was suggested as a possible treatment. The reduction in the availability of antiprotozoal drugs has been noted as a complicating factor in treatment of other protozoal infections.

2500|$|On February 1, 1983, Karen and Richard met {{for dinner}} and {{discussed}} future plans for the Carpenters, including a return to touring. On February 3, Karen visited her parents, and discussed finalising her divorce to Burris.

After spending 20 minutes in a waiting room, a doctor entered to tell Richard and his parents that Karen had died. The autopsy stated that her death was caused by [...] "emetine cardiotoxicity due to or as a consequence of anorexia nervosa."

Doctor Granville, at the outside, will cure his pyorrhea with <b>emetine</b> for no more than a paltry fifty dollars.

50|$|The {{identification}} of <b>emetine</b> {{as a more}} potent agent improved the treatment of amoebiasis. While use of <b>emetine</b> still caused nausea, it was {{more effective than the}} crude extract of ipecac root. Additionally, <b>emetine</b> could be administered hypodermically which still produced nausea, but not to the degree experienced in oral administration.|$|E
50|$|<b>Emetine</b> dihydrochloro hydrate {{is used in}} the {{laboratory}} to block protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. It does this by binding to the 40S subunit of the ribosome. This can thus be used in the study of protein degradation in cells. Mutants resistant to <b>emetine</b> are altered in the 40S ribosomal subunit (S14 protein), and they exhibit cross-resistance to cryptopleurine, tylocrebrine, cephaeline and tubulosine, but not other inhibitors of protein synthesis. The compounds to which these mutants exhibit cross-resistance have been shown to share common structural determinants with <b>emetine</b> that are responsible for their biological activities.|$|E
50|$|Ipecac or {{ipecacuanha}} {{consists of}} the dried rhizome and roots of Cephaelis ipecacuanha. The medical virtues of ipecac are almost entirely due to the action of its alkaloids-emetine and cephaline. Till today, <b>emetine</b> {{remains one of the}} best drugs for treating amoebic liver abscess. It has a direct action on the trophozoites.Its greater concentration and duration of action in the liver as compared to that in the intestinal wall explains its high efficacy in amoebic liver abscess and also its low parasitic cure rate for intestinal amoebiasis. The drug is detoxicated and eliminated slowly. It may, therefore, produce cumulative effects. In man, <b>emetine</b> poisoning is characterized by muscular tremors, weakness and pain in the extremities which tend to persist until drug administration is stopped. Gastro-intestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting and bloody diarrhoea. The latter may be mistaken for a recurrence of amoebic dysentery.Many clinicians fear the occurrence of cardiac toxicity due to this drug and hence avoid using it. Serious cardiac toxicity, however, is rare. Both recovered with the treatment for heart failure and withdrawal of <b>emetine.</b> One patient who was given fifteen injections of <b>emetine</b> in a dose of 60 mgm per day, died. Overdosage of <b>emetine</b> produces focal necrosis of cardiac muscle resulting in cardiac failure and sudden death.Emetine, like digitalis may produce mild ST and T wave changes in the electrocardiogram which does not necessarily mean serious toxicity. In fact, they are encountered, though less commonly, after the use of chloroquine and metronidazole as well. Toxic effects on the myocardium have been described even in doses generally considered safe. These are rise in pulse rate, fall in systolic blood pressure and ST-T changes in the electrocardiogram.The other rare E.C.G. changes include deformity of QRS complexes, prolongation of PR interval, atrial premature beats, and atrial tachycardia. In adults, fatal cases have been reported with a total dose of 0.6 G. or less. The incidence of toxic heart damage greatly increases in patients with anaemia. In patients having myocardial disease or marked hypertension, <b>emetine</b> can be used for amoebic liver abscess, as the benefits from it may outweigh possible hazards. This situation is unlikely to arise these days, as equally good alternative drugs like metronidazole are available. Patients receiving <b>emetine</b> should be monitored for changes in pulse, blood pressure and electrocardiography. Absolute bed rest during and several days after <b>emetine</b> therapy has been recommended, although we have often seen patients in whom no untoward reactions have occurred in spite of neglecting the above precaution. Theoretically the use of <b>emetine</b> in children is not advised. However, in practice it has been used as discussed elsewhere. It should not be administered during pregnancy unless absolutely necessary.Although <b>emetine</b> is undeniably moderately toxic, the risk of using it would be worth accepting in such a serious illness {{were it not for the}} fact that less toxic drugs like chloroquine and metronidazole are now available. In practice, <b>emetine</b> still produces a more dramatic clinical response thanchloroquine or metronidazole. This point would score in favour of <b>emetine</b> in places where facilities for a proper diagnosis are not available and a therapeutic test remains as the only weapon with a practitioner. <b>Emetine</b> should always be given deep intramuscularly or deep subcutaneously but never intravenously. The total dose in amoebic liver abscess should not exceed 650 mg or 10 mg/kg. This should be given over a period of 10 days in a dose of 6G65 mg. daily. A relapse rate of 7% follows one such course. Therefore, the treatment could be repeated after a period of 2-6 weeks. Of late such a need does not arise, as drug combinations are commonly used. When parenteral <b>emetine</b> is combined with oral chloroquine or two courses of <b>emetine</b> are given, the relapse rate can be brought down to 1 percent.|$|E

50|$|It is a {{synthetic}} compound developed by Osbond et al. and Brossi et al. in 1959. It is {{as effective as}} <b>emetine</b> in its amoebicidal properties. Given parenterally dehydroemetine is surprisingly painless. Oral tablets have been introduced. But for some reason, these tablets have not become popular. A high cure rate can be obtained with this drug. Compared to <b>emetine,</b> its concentration in the heart is less. Electrocardiographic changes are not seen so often. When present, they are more transient than with emetine.Dehydroemetine is excreted by the kidneys, heart and the other organs more rapidly than <b>emetine.</b> Therefore, a daily dose of 1.25 mg or 1.5 mg/kg body weight is necessary. The total daily dose should not exceed 90 mg. The course should not be repeated in less than 14 days.|$|E
50|$|<b>Emetine</b> {{is a drug}} used as both an anti-protozoal and {{to induce}} vomiting. It is {{produced}} from the ipecac root. It {{takes its name from}} its emetic properties.|$|E
50|$|Early use of <b>emetine</b> was in {{the form}} of oral {{administration}} of the extract of ipecac root, or ipecacuanha. This extract was originally thought to contain only one alkaloid, <b>emetine,</b> but was found to contain several, including cephaeline, psychotrine and others. Although this therapy was reportedly successful, the extract caused vomiting in many patients which reduced its utility. In some cases, it was given with opioids to reduce nausea. Other suggestions to reduce nausea involved coating the drug to allow it to be released after digestion in the stomach.|$|E
50|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of cephaeline and <b>emetine</b> {{come from}} two main biosynthesis pathways: the biosynthesis of Dopamine from L-tyrosine and the biosynthesis of secologanin from geranyl diphosphate. Biosynthesis begins from the reaction between dopamine and secologanin forming N-deacetylisoipecoside (S-form) and N-deacetylipecoside (R-form). The S-form then {{goes through a}} Pictet-Spengler type reaction followed {{by a series of}} O-methylations and the removal of glucose, with O-methyltransferases and a glycosidase, to form proemetine. Proemetine then reacts with another dopamine molecule to form 7'-O-demethylcephaeline. The final products are then produced with a 7'-O-methylation to make cephaeline and a 6'-O-methylation successively to make <b>emetine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dehydroemetine is a {{synthetically}} produced antiprotozoal agent {{similar to}} <b>emetine</b> in its anti-amoebic properties and structure (they differ {{only in a}} double bond next to the ethyl group), but it produces fewer side effects.|$|E

50|$|The {{introduction}} of cinchona into therapeutics {{was due to}} the discovery of its efficacy in malaria. In 1921, John used quinine hydrochloride, an alkaloid of cinchona in the treatment of amoebic liver abscess. Later when synthetic derivatives of quinine were introduced, chloroquine phosphate, a 4-aminoquinoline was found to be less toxic than the parent drug. The drug was first quoted in the treatment of this condition in very early reports by Conan (1948)15, Murgatroyd and Kent (1948). It is absorbed rapidly and completely from the gastrointestinal tract. It is found to be very effective in invasive amoebiasis although the drug is a weaker amoebicide when compared to <b>emetine.</b> It is only feebly amoebicidal in the intestinal lumen.The high concentration in the liver parenchyma and the lung allows the drug to act upon E. Histolytica in cases of amoebic liver abscess and pleuropulmonary amoebiasis.It is usually well tolerated, but in some individuals it may cause mild headache, itching, nausea, vomiting or blurred vision. Rarely incoordination, convulsions, peripheral neuritis and bleaching of hair can occur. Diminution of T waves has been noticed on routine electrocardiographic recordings. Retinopathy does not occur with the usual dosage for amoebic liver abscess. Psychic disturbances though rare may interfere with the safe operation of machines and vehicles. The drug may be toxic to children in large doses18 and causes deafness in the foetus. Each 0.5 G. tablet contains chloroquine diphosphate equivalent to 0.3 G. of the base. For the treatment of amoebic liver abscess, it is administered in doses of 0.6 G. base per day in 2 to 3 divided doses orally for 2 days followed by 0.15 G. base twice daily for 2 to 3 weeks. However, Plorde recommends that it be given as 0.6 G. base initially, 0.3 G. base six hours later and then 0.3 G. base twice daily for fourteen to twenty eight days.19 Chloroquine is also available in an injectable form. Since it is quite toxic by this route, it should not be used for more than 24-48 hours after which oral therapy should be continued. Rarely, when patients of amoebic liver abscess are vomiting, injection chloroquine {{can be used in a}} dose of 0.3-0.6 G. base in 24 hours not exceeding 0.9 G.). Chloroquine given alone is a safer drug than <b>emetine</b> in amoebic liver abscess, but unfortunately the relapse rate is almost 25%. Rarely repetition of the course may induce a dramatic response.|$|E
