5|$|A central {{organizing}} {{concept in}} biology is that life changes and develops through <b>evolution,</b> <b>and</b> that all life-forms known {{have a common}} origin. The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool. This universal common ancestor of all organisms {{is believed to have}} appeared about 3.5 billion years ago. Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (see: origin of life).|$|E

With his book The Extended Phenotype (1982), he introduced into evolutionary biology the influential concept that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism's body, but can stretch far into the environment. In 2006, he founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science.|$|E

5|$|Eta Carinae {{is a close}} binary {{and this}} complicates the {{evolution}} of both stars. Compact massive companions can strip mass from larger primary stars {{much more quickly than}} would occur in a single star, so the properties at core collapse can be very different. In some scenarios, the secondary can accrue significant mass, accelerating its <b>evolution,</b> <b>and</b> in turn be stripped by the now compact Wolf–Rayet primary. In the case of Eta Carinae, the secondary is clearly causing additional instability in the primary, making it difficult to predict future developments.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{biology is}} partly based on paleontology, which uses {{the fossil record}} to answer {{questions}} about the mode and tempo of <b>evolution,</b> <b>and</b> partly on the developments in areas such as population genetics. In the 1980s, developmental biology re-entered evolutionary biology after its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary developmental biology. Phylogenetics, systematics, and taxonomy are related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology.|$|E

5|$|Heavy metals {{condense}} in planets as {{a result}} of stellar <b>evolution</b> <b>and</b> destruction processes. Stars lose much of their mass when it is ejected late in their lifetimes, and sometimes thereafter {{as a result}} of a neutron star merger, thereby increasing the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the interstellar medium. When gravitational attraction causes this matter to coalesce and collapse new stars and planets are formed.|$|E
5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what counts as science, how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on <b>evolution,</b> <b>and</b> values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.|$|E
