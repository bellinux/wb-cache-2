5|$|The {{skirmish}} {{became a}} full-scale battle by 4:00p.m. After the Americans drove Captain Pipe's Delawares {{out of the}} woods and onto to prairie, the Delawares were reinforced by Dunquat's Wyandots. Elliott also arrived on the scene and coordinated the actions of the Delawares and the Wyandots. Pipe's Delawares skillfully outflanked the American position and then attacked their rear. A few Indians crept close to the American lines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> prairie grass. The Americans responded by climbing trees to get a better shot at them. Gunsmoke filled the air, making it difficult to see. After {{three and a half hours}} of incessant firing, the Indians gradually broke off the attack with the approach of nightfall. Both sides slept with arms at the ready, and surrounded their positions with large fires to prevent surprise night attacks.|$|E
5|$|Ash soon {{comes to}} realize that the Pikachu refuses to go inside his Poké Ball and prefers his independence. As Ash carries the {{reluctant}} Pikachu, he hopes that they can be friends, but Pikachu acts aloof and openly shows his distrust of Ash. Just then, the two stumble upon a Pidgey in the wild and Ash unsuccessfully tries to catch it by throwing a Poké Ball. Ash uses his Pokédex and finds out that in order to catch a Pokémon, a trainer must first use their Pokémon to battle it, thereby weakening it, to be caught by a Poké Ball. With Pikachu being uncooperative, Ash tries to fight the Pidgey himself, but is easily beaten, which greatly amuses Pikachu. The Pidgey escapes and Ash finds a Rattata rummaging through his pack. He chases the Pokémon off as he hears cooing behind him. He turns to see several Pidgey gathered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> grass. Frustrated, Ash throws a rock at what he believes is the Pidgey. However, {{it turns out to be}} a Spearow, which starts attacking Pikachu and Ash. Pikachu shocks Spearow, and in the process alerts a whole flock. The angered Spearow flock gives chase and eventually catches up and attacks Pikachu. Ash quickly grabs Pikachu and dives down a waterfall in order to escape from the flock of Spearow, and the two are fished out down river by a young girl named Misty, who tells Ash to take the injured Pikachu to the Pokémon Center in Viridian City. Seeing the Spearow flock approaching, Ash escapes with Pikachu taking Misty's bike.|$|E
5|$|The squash {{house was}} {{constructed}} around 1920, completed in 1931, and was demolished between 2011 and 2013. It was {{located near the}} Logan Riding Ring, on the club's south entrance road. It was two stories high, five bays wide and nine bays deep, and was stucco-covered with a flat roof. There were two entrances on the main (south) facade, one at ground level and another on the balcony. The entrances had double wooden doors, paneled below and glazed above. All of the building's windows consisted of wood-framed, paired casement windows with brick sills. A veranda with Tuscan piers extended {{the length of the}} main facade, interrupted by a two-bay-wide, one-bay-deep projection east of the main entrance. The building's interior contained a doubles court, two singles courts, a reception room, locker rooms, showers, and a spectators' gallery seating 150. Across the road from where the building stood is an outdoor riding ring enclosed by a rough rail fence. To the west of the building's site, standing alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> grass, is a 16th-century post-and-lintel stone element, which {{was at the center of}} the stage of a 1,500-seat outdoor Greek amphitheater that was part of the Shepard estate and was since dismantled.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the next}} several weeks, non-Bt cornfields should be scouted for European corn borers. If populations do exceed the {{economic}} threshold, treatment is warranted to prevent substantial yield loss. Scouting should start <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tallest</b> cornfields because adults (moths) are often attracted to these fields in larger numbers. Look for shot holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leaves after corn reaches 17 to 21 inches in extended leaf height. When shot holes or larvae are found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>taller</b> corn, scout fields with smaller corn. There is very little reason to scout a field for larvae if no shot holes are detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leaves...|$|R

25|$|Softly, {{well before}} the winter dawn, the yellow monster lurched towards the grey façade. A lone rook stirred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> beeches nearby, troubled by the {{relentless}} purring of powerful motors. Down beyond the stream, what remains of his ornamental garden, a few regal bamboo blades, trembled in the night breeze. A mighty arm nudged the building. There was no crash, not even a rumble. Masonry fell with a rustle and hiss of dust down ivy-clad walls, to thud in moss. Within the hour, Frescati was no more.|$|E

25|$|Connery began {{bodybuilding}} {{at the age}} of 18, {{and from}} 1951 trained heavily with Ellington, a former gym instructor in the British army. While his official website claims he was third in the 1950 Mr. Universe contest, most sources place him in the 1953 competition, either third in the Junior class or failing to place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tall</b> Man classification. Connery stated that he was soon deterred from bodybuilding when he found that the Americans frequently beat him in competitions because of sheer muscle size and, unlike Connery, refused to participate in athletic activity which could make them lose muscle mass.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the church contains numerous funerary monuments, some of noteworthy artistic value. The Chapel of the Holy Sacrament (Cappella del Santissimo Sacramento, also known as Cappella Gattamelata), in the right aisle, houses {{the tomb of the}} famous condottiero Gattamelata and of his son Giannantonio. The bronze tabernacle is made by Girolamo Campagna. This chapel, with its broad bands of polychrome and carved Gothic details, has had many stages of decoration, the final stage being the creation of an mosaic <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> rear niche representing the Holy Spirit with rays of golden light descending against a background of intensely blue sky. This work was created by Lodovico Pogliaghi between 1927–36.|$|E
25|$|Now {{made up of}} a {{cadre of}} {{experienced}} and fully trained soldiers, the squadron performed with considerable distinction in this campaign, and was involved in arguably {{one of the most significant}} small unit actions of the campaign at the Battle of Kaiapit where, on 19–20 September 1943, it captured the village and then repelled a determined enemy counterattack by a force much larger than its own, until relieved. After the action, 214 Japanese bodies were counted, and it was estimated that another 50 or more lay dead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> grass. Abandoned equipment that was recovered included 19 machine guns, 150 rifles, six grenade throwers and 12 Japanese swords. Against this, the Australians lost 11 killed and 23 wounded. For his leadership during this action, Gordon King was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E

25|$|On 27 April 2016, Ili {{signed a}} {{full-time}} {{contract with the}} Breakers. However, he was an early casualty as the Breakers launched their pre-season due to a stress fracture in his back that ruled him out {{for at least six}} weeks. Ili picked up the injury while playing for the Saints, though played a full part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tall</b> Blacks' Olympic qualifying programme. Only after commencing preparations for the new Australian NBL season was {{the full extent of the}} problem discovered. The Breakers wasted no time bringing in a short-term replacement for Ili, with Australian Isaih Tueta joining the squad in mid-September ahead of the 2016–17 NBL season. After spending three months on the sidelines, Ili was reactivated in late November and made his debut as a fully contracted roster player in Cairns against the Taipans. After making the grand final in 2016, the Breakers missed the playoffs in 2017 with a 14–14 record. Ili appeared in 17 games for the Breakers in 2016–17, averaging 4.4 points, 1.9 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game.|$|E

In subsequent chapters, Ernest worries that Mary is unable to kill the lion for various reasons: she is too short to see the prey <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> grass; she misses her shots with other game; and he thinks she is too soft-hearted to kill the animal. During this period, Ernest becomes entranced with Debba, a woman from a local village, whom the others jokingly refer to as his second wife.

The [...] "pushers out" [...] followed when the aircraft made a second pass over the drop. One Australian injured his shoulder in the drop. The gunners then had to locate and assemble their guns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tall</b> grass. Enough parts were found to assemble one gun and have it ready for firing within {{two and a half hours}} of dropping, although to maintain surprise they did not carry out registration fire until morning. It took three days to find the missing parts and assemble the other gun. At 1515, two B-17s dropped 192 boxes of ammunition. Their dropping was accurate, but some boxes of ammunition tore away from their parachutes.|$|E
