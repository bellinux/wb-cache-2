25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in Grand Valley {{with the}} promise of the railway, the town began to boom. Regular voyages were made by steam sternwheelers to the city, each {{bringing}} more and more settlers. In the spring of 1881, General Thomas L. Rosser, Chief Engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in Grand Valley. It was Rosser's job to choose the townsites for the railway. Rosser approached Dougald McVicar of Grand Valley and offered him $25,000 for the railway in Grand Valley. McVicar countered with $50,000 to which Rosser replied that “I’ll be <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> a town of any kind is ever built here". So instead Rosser crossed the Assiniboine river and built the site of the railway on the high sandy south of the River, two miles west of Grand Valley. So the site was then moved to a site just west of today's current First Street bridge in Brandon. A shanty had been built there by a man named J.D. Adamson, and it was on this quarter section Adamson claimed that Rosser chose as the townsite for the CPR Railway and named Brandon.|$|E

After fears of violence across the Arab world proved exaggerated following {{the beginning of the}} Afghan War, commentators dismissed the Arab street as apathetic and harmless, only to suddenly reclaim it as an object of fear when popular protests erupted all over the region in response to Israel's 2002 invasion of the West Bank. He denounced the term as a colonialist and Orientalist creation, similar to an earlier term [...] "the Arab mind", which [...] "reified the culture and collective conduct of an entire people in a violent abstraction." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2008, Neighbours was branded [...] "too white" [...] {{by black}} and Asian viewers in Britain. A {{report found that}} many ethnic viewers felt they were {{under-represented}} in some of Britain's most popular television shows. In Australia {{there was talk of}} a 'White Australia policy' when it came to casting actors for top-rated soaps. In response to the criticism, executive producer Susan Bower made the decision to add more ethnically diverse extras, small walk on roles and speaking parts. She also decided to introduce 15-year-old Korean actor Hany Lee into the cast as exchange student, Sunny Lee.

500|$|The British Royal House faced {{a serious}} problem during the First World War because of its blood ties to the ruling family of Germany, Britain's prime adversary in the war. Before the war, the British royal family had been known as the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1910, George V became King {{on the death of}} his father, King Edward VII, and {{remained}} king throughout the war. He was the first cousin of the German Kaiser WilhelmII, who came to symbolise all the horrors of the war. Queen Mary, although British like her mother, was the daughter of the Duke of Teck, a descendant of the German Royal House of Württemberg. During the war H. G. Wells wrote about Britain's [...] "alien and uninspiring court", and George famously replied: [...] "I may be uninspiring, but I'll be <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> I'm alien." ...|$|E

Tom Breihan commented that Knowles [...] " [...] with force and purpose on the verses". As the song opens, she tells her lover, [...] "I can't let you go", and that she will not allow another woman to take everything she owns, including the chinchilla coats and {{the house on the}} coast. Knowles screams the refrain—"Ring the alarm, I've been doin this too long / But I'll be <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> I see another chick on your arm"—"through a thick fog of distortion", as noted by Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe added that she chants the lines with grit and urgency, while Breihan wrote that she sings them [...] "with a frantic intensity". Knowles later declares that her relationship is [...] "not the picture perfect movie everyone would assume".|$|E

John Cooper reviewed the encyclopedia for The Times, and described it as [...] "an entertaining compilation of ideas ranging from who was the 'real William Shakespeare' to the BCCI case and al-Qaeda". Cooper noted, [...] "The most fascinating section relates to 'Assassinations'... an unusual fairytale book for Christmas."

500|$|William Corder (born 1803) {{was the son}} of a local {{farmer and}} had a {{reputation}} as something of a fraudster and a ladies' man. He was known as [...] "Foxey" [...] at school because of his sly manner. He had fraudulently sold his father's pigs, although his father had settled the matter without involving the law, but Corder had not changed his behaviour. He later obtained money by passing a forged cheque for £93 and he had helped local thief Samuel [...] "Beauty" [...] Smith steal a pig from a neighbouring village. When Smith was questioned by the local constable over the theft, he made a prophetic statement concerning Corder: [...] "I'll be <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> he will not be hung some of these days". Corder had been sent to London in disgrace after his fraudulent sale of the pigs, but he was recalled to Polstead when his brother Thomas drowned attempting to cross a frozen pond. His father and three brothers all died within 18 months of each other and only William remained to run the farm with his mother.|$|E

Please to God it may soon be over." [...] From 1914 to 1918, Britain and its allies were at war with the Central Powers, led by the German Empire. The German Kaiser Wilhelm II, who for the British public came to symbolise all the horrors of the war, was the King's first cousin. The King's paternal grandfather was Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; consequently, the King and his children bore the titles Prince and Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke and Duchess of Saxony. Queen Mary, although British like her mother, was the daughter of the Duke of Teck, a descendant of the German Dukes of Württemberg. The King had brothers-in-law and cousins who were British subjects but who bore German titles such as Duke and Duchess of Teck, Prince and Princess of Battenberg, and Prince and Princess of Schleswig-Holstein. When H. G. Wells wrote about Britain's [...] "alien and uninspiring court", George famously replied: [...] "I may be uninspiring, but I'll be <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> I'm alien." ...|$|E

Scott {{was supposed to have}} replied, [...] "Post and be damned; but if you do, you will only post yourself a damned liar, and everybody else will say so." [...] On another occasion, after reviewing a speech written for him by Bledsoe, the governor was said to have remarked, [...] "Well, Mr. Bledsoe, I know you think you are a damned sight smarter than I am, and so you are in many respects; but this message as it is now, won't do at all; I'll be <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> it will." [...] When Bledsoe asked what was wrong with the speech, he reportedly replied, [...] "Why, damn it to hell, why don't you put a good solemn prayer at the end of it, and talk about Providence, and the protection of Heaven, and all that?" [...] After the governor campaigned for Humphrey Marshall's opponent in the 1809 legislative elections, Marshall published an article in the Western World newspaper that accused him of appearing in front of the court house drunk on election day.|$|E

2500|$|In some accounts, Themistocles also {{ended up}} visiting the Persian king, {{following}} his ostracism and spectacular fall from public favour in Athens. Rumours {{that he was}} medizing offered Timocreon a chance for revengesee Fragment 728 and Fragment 729. Timocreon was {{also known as a}} composer of scolia (drinking-songs) and, according to the Suda, wrote plays in the style of Old Comedy. A famous drinking song of his was about the god Plutus, which seems to have inspired imitation by Aristophanessee Fragment 731. Nothing however is known of his comedies and it is probable that he was not a dramatist but simply composed mocking lyrics. In an account by Philodemus (On Vices 10.4), he is presented as a conceited singer at a festival competition, where he performed a song about Castor. Diogenian mentions two proverbs that Timocreon employed in his verses. One was a Cyprian fable about doves escaping from a sacrificial fire only to fall into another fire later on (demonstrating that wrong-doers eventually get their just deserts), and the other was a Carian fable about a fisherman [...] who espies an octopus in the winter sea and wonders whether or not to dive after it, since this is a choice between his children starving or himself freezing to death (i.e. you're <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> you do and <b>damned</b> <b>if</b> you don't). The latter proverb was also used by Simonides, whose rivalry with Timocreon seems to have inspired the abusive 'epitaph' quoted earlier and the epigrammatic reply from the Rhodian poet in A.P. 13.31.|$|E
