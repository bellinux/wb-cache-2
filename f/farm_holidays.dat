40|$|Abstract: <b>Farm</b> <b>holidays</b> are {{becoming}} more and more frequent in the choices of people. First of all, this is due to the less costs related to such kind of accommodation. But, apart this mere reason, it’s evident that <b>farm</b> <b>holidays,</b> thanks to the possibility of assessing closer relationships with people living in the surrounding areas, induce a sort of relational tourism, in this way facilitating the cultural exchanges between hosting and visiting people. This last motivation seems to be an additional attractive reason for people in selecting such farms for their holiday’s trips. The present paper speculates about the possible features of a new quality award for holidays farms, able to take into account not only the service and its environmental performances, but also the quality of the food offered to people that, generally, is produced inside the same farm, that is the so called "farm holidays with working farm". The proposed approach, for the accommodation services will refer to the existing European Ecolabel scheme for hotels and camp-sites. Moreover, for the quality of the food, the suggested scheme will refer to the well known food labels, concerning the quality of the product itself and the whole chain of production. Finally, the impact exerted on the environment by these facilities and by the agricultural activities related with them is here supposed to be assessed by means of a Life Cycle Analysis approach.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1960, farms {{are one of}} the {{alternatively}} forms of hospitality in few Italian regions located predominately in the north and in the centre of peninsula. In 1985, Italian government promulgated a law in order to regulate this non-conventional form of tourism, by delegating to the regions the direct management of administrative procedures and inspections in farms. Nowadays, Italian agritourist farms represent a good chance to give value in favour of farm by the diversification of agrarian activities and also by holistically promoting local food in a direct connection to local gastronomy, rural heritage and tradition, with positive effects on the endogenous development in rural areas. The aim of the paper was to assess the role of agritourism in raising the socio-economic development of rural space by the diffusion of certified quality food using a quantitative approach and to assess if agritourist and certified quality food were tools able to implement the living conditions in the countryside. The findings have disclosed that tourists from abroad have increased the level of farmer income giving value towards high quality food and <b>farm</b> <b>holidays</b> farms.

Tulokset vuodelta 1996 perustuvat 40 sellaisen maatilan kirjanpitoon, joilla on maatalouden ohella myös yhtä tai useampaa muuta yritystoimintaa. Nämä tilat ovat maatiloina yleensä pienehköjä. Pääasialliset muut toimialat olivat koneurakointi, elintarvikkeiden jatkojalostus, puun jatkojalostus ja maatilamatkailu. Nettotuloksella mitattuna parhaiten näytti kannattavan puun jatkojalostus. Monialaisten maatilayritysten talousseuranta on toistaiseksi ollut kovin vähäistä. Maaseudun kehittämisen näkökulmasta seurannan laajentaminen ja eri toimialojen kattavuuden lisääminen on erittäin tarpeellista. This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with pluriactive farm enterprises, i. e. farms practising other entrepreneurial activities besides traditional agricultural production, and the benefits obtained from such pluriactivities. The objective {{is to find out}} whether pluriactivity has improved the profitability of the farm enterprise. The study is based on data from the profitability bookkeeping of farm enterprises, and the reference data concerning agriculture consists of results from the FADN farms. The profitability bookkeeping of pluriactive farm enterprises was started in 1996, and in the first year 40 farms participated in the bookkeeping. The article concerning the economy of pluriactive farm enterprises deals with machine contracting, wood processing, <b>farm</b> <b>holidays</b> and processing of agricultural products as separate branches of industry, and the profitability of these has been compared with that of traditional farm enterprises. According to the results of 1996, the profitability of pluriactive farm enterprises was weaker than that of traditional farms. However, {{on the basis of the}} financial statements of one single year no direct conclusions concerning the unprofitability of pluriactivity can be made. The area of the pluriactive farms participating in the bookkeeping was smaller than on the traditional farms, and thus the income from agriculture only would also very likely have been smaller than in the reference group. vokMTT Taloustutkimus (MTTL...|$|E
40|$|Rad je fokusiran na agroturizam kao segmentirani oblik turizma te navodi prihvaćene definicije pojma. Nepostojeći jedinstveni model agroturizma u današnjoj Europi reflektira se u raznolikosti njegove organizacije kako na nacionalnim, tako i na regionalnim razinama. Popularnost i potražnja za takvom vrstom odmora, s druge strane, uvjetuju nagli razvitak agroturizma kako bi se odgovorilo potrebama tržišta. Nejedinstvenost europskih politika u tom području rezultira i različitom razvijenošću pojedinih modela. Rad predstavlja primjere agroturizma Italije, Austrije, Francuske, Velike Britanije, Cipra i Rumunjske te ih uspoređuje s agroturizmom Hrvatske. Etnologija u suvremenim turističkim pravcima razvoja tako izuzetno dobiva na značenju budući da je primijećeno sve snažnije seosko privređivanje kao važan razvojni turistički pravac. The {{article focuses}} on agrotourism as a {{selective}} form of tourism and starts with some definitions of the concept itself. The great variety of definitions results in different approaches to the concept. Still, a definition that has been adopted at the Bilbao conference in 1991 accepted a unique syntagm for out-of-city space as a 2 ̆ 7 rural space 2 ̆ 7. Therefore, the concept of rural tourism has been accepted. It embraces different forms of tourist activities: agrotourism and farms; outdoor activities; eco-tourism; rural experience; cultural tourism; and other combined forms of special interest tourism. The article presents legal framework within which Croatian rural tourism is defined {{as well as the}} state of this form of tourism in Croatia. Further it is compared with the organization of rural tourism in other European countries. Non-existence of a unique model of agrotourism in today’s Europe is reflected in the diversity of its organization both on national as well as on regional levels. Popularity and demand of this type of a holiday, on the other hand, facilitate rapid development of agrotourism in accordance to the market needs. Non-existence of uniform European policies in this field also results in the diverse degree of development of single models. Examples of agrotourism in Italy, Austria, France, Great Britain, Cyprus and Romania show different models in the organization of rural tourism. Italy is one of the rare countries which operates within a national legal framework but also practices regional laws which regulate it locally/regionally. In all presented countries, rural tourism operates within various associations be they governmental organizations (Cyprus Agrotourism Company), non-governmental organizations (Agriturist in Italy, <b>Farm</b> <b>Holidays</b> in Austria, Gîtes de France in France, ANTREC in Romania) or professional organizations (Farm Stay UK in Great Britain). There is no unique model of rural tourism in Croatia, too. Different laws regulate some aspects of rural tourism but not its organizational aspect. Some counties are more active in this form of tourism (such as County of Istria or Dubrovnik and Neretva County) which affects also the geographical distribution of rural tourism households. World trends show the great increase of this form of tourism although the organizational differences influence its stronger and more systematic growth to a certain extent. Still, modern rural households are more adaptive to the new forms of economic activities which include tourism. In this way, contemporary ethnology has a great role since a stronger rural economy has been noticed as a relevant tourism development direction...|$|E
