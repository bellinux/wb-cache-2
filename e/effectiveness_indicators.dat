50|$|The {{principal}} objective of sustainability indicators is to inform public policy-making {{as part of}} the process of sustainability governance.Sustainability indicators can provide information on any aspect of the interplay between the environment and socio-economic activities. Building strategic indicator sets generally deals with just a few simple questions: what is happening? (descriptive indicators), does it matter and are we reaching targets? (performance indicators), are we improving? (efficiency indicators), are measures working? (policy <b>effectiveness</b> <b>indicators),</b> and are we generally better off? (total welfare indicators). One popular general framework used by The European Environment Agency uses a slight modification of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development DPSIR system. This breaks up environmental impact into five stages. Social and economic developments (consumption and production) (D)rive or initiate environmental (P)ressures which, in turn, produces a change in the (S)tate of the environment which leads to (I)mpacts of various kinds. Societal (R)esponses (policy guided by sustainability indicators) can be introduced at any stage of this sequence of events.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 In 1990, the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges {{moved to}} an {{accreditation}} model based on outcomes, their assessment and deliberative attempts at institutional change and improvement. No study existed in northwest community colleges which identified the systematic application of <b>effectiveness</b> <b>indicators</b> for institutional change and improvement. This {{study was conducted}} with primary administrators in northwest community colleges that have completed the regional accreditation process since 1990. It examined the perceived importance of using <b>effectiveness</b> <b>indicators</b> for assessing institutional outcomes, and their congruence with actual or potential use in making institutional change and improvements. This study shows there is a positive relationship in community colleges between the development of institutional <b>effectiveness</b> <b>indicators</b> and institutional change and improvement. All administrators believed they should be using <b>effectiveness</b> <b>indicators</b> but used them in varying degrees for planning, improving services, budgeting, accreditation, program review and other decision making processes essential to the functioning of community colleges. Although the use varied by category and administrative subgroup, those administrators who had used <b>effectiveness</b> <b>indicators</b> believed their use led to positive institutional change. In order for this study to have an affect on northwest community colleges, several important conditions need to be addressed. The Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges must enforce Policy Statement 2. 2, Policy on Educational Assessment, which requires the adoption of an institutional effectiveness model. Community colleges must embrace this model as a mechanism useful for the continuous improvement process. Faculty, staff, administrators and boards must be trained in the application and use of the institutional effectiveness model. Boards must establish outcomes or institutional goals based on their unique mission and must hold the community college president accountable for the achievement of institutional outcomes and the implementation of an assessment process. Assessment must be completed {{at all levels of the}} institution. Institutions must adopt an assessment model that reflects the institutions goals and objectives, and place its responsibility prominently within the organization. Finally, measures must be developed at each level or process by the persons closest to the process. Failure to enforce accreditation standards will lead to publicly enacted performance indicators aimed at achieving institutional effectiveness or accountability...|$|E

Currently there are no standard national or international safety <b>effectiveness</b> <b>indicators</b> (SEIs) that are accepted by the construction industry.

40|$|This {{purpose of}} this article is to develop an <b>effectiveness</b> <b>indicator</b> (EI) for Chile’s tax administration. We assume that the goal of the Chilean Internal Revenue Service (SII) is to {{maximize}} tax revenue while minimizing compliance costs. Sample taxpayer surveys and statistical information both show that SII service standards - a proxy for compliance costs - improved in the 1990 s. Compliance rates, which are used as EI by the SII itself, also improved significantly. Regression analysis, however, suggests that this improvement can largely be explained by the strong economic growth experienced during the period. We argue that an appropriate EI for the goal of revenue maximization is the actual compliance rate divided by maximum achievable compliance given the values of variables that are beyond SII control. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of the study was}} to measure the relationship between efficiency assessed by ACG® and a clinical <b>effectiveness</b> <b>indicator</b> in adults attended in Primary Health Care Centres (PHCs). Methods: Research design: cross-sectional study. Subjects: 196, 593 patients aged > 14 years in 13 PHCs in Catalonia (Spain). Measures: Age, sex, PHC, basic care team (BCT), visits, episodes (diagnoses), and total direct costs of PHC care and co-morbidity as measured by ACG® indicators: Efficiency indices for costs, visits, and episodes (costs EI, visits EI, episodes EI); a complexity or risk index (RI); and effectiveness measured by a general synthetic index (SI). The relationship between EI, RI, and SI in each PHC and BCT was measured by multiple correlation coefficients (r). Results: In total, 56 of the 106 defined ACG® were present in the study population, with five corresponding to 44. 5 % of the patients, 11 to 68. 0 % of patients, and 30 present in less than 0. 5 % of the sample. The RI in each PHC ranged from 0. 9 to 1. 1. Costs, visits, and episodes had similar trends for efficiency in six PHCs. There was moderate correlation between costs EI and visits EI (r[*]=[*] 0. 59). SI correlation with episodes EI and costs EI was moderate (r[*]=[*] 0. 48 and r[*]=[*]− 0. 34, respectively) and was r[*]=[*]− 0. 14 for visits EI. Correlation between RI and SI was r[*]=[*] 0. 29. Conclusions: The Efficiency and <b>Effectiveness</b> ACG® <b>indicators</b> permit a comparison of primary care processes between PHCs.
