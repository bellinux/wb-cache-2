Schools furnished instructors, training sites and facilities, aircraft maintenance, quarters, and mess halls. From the Air Corps, schools received a flat fee of $1,170 for each graduate and $18 per <b>flying</b> <b>hour</b> for students eliminated from training.

25|$|Taiwan took {{delivery}} of 119 F-100As, 4 RF-100As and 14 F-100Fs and lost {{a number of}} F-100As and Fs {{in the course of}} service, but never lost a single RF-100As in either combat or accident. Those four RF-100As had never been sent on reconnaissance mission over mainland China as they could only produce photographic images of mediocre quality at best. Moreover, after each <b>flying</b> <b>hour,</b> the ground personnel had to spend over hundred hours on the aircraft maintenance. All of the RF-100As were returned to the US after one year and 11 months (1st January 1959 - 1st December 1960) in ROCAF service.|$|E

25|$|At one time, it {{held the}} record of 1,000 {{maintenance}} hours per <b>flying</b> <b>hour.</b> Although the Scimitar could operate as a fighter, the interceptor role was covered by the De Havilland Sea Venom and then the de Havilland Sea Vixen. The Scimitar itself {{was replaced by the}} Blackburn Buccaneer. The Scimitar was kept initially as a tanker to allow the underpowered Buccaneer S.1 to be launched from aircraft carriers with a useful weapons load. To save weight, the Buccaneer would take off with minimum fuel then top up from a Scimitar. Late in the Scimitar's operational career, examples were flown between 1965 and 1970 by the Fleet Requirements Unit (FRU) based at Bournemouth Airport (Hurn). The FRU was managed by Airwork Services and provided realistic flight operations for land and sea based naval training units.|$|E
25|$|By the mid -1990s, each Sea King {{required}} over 30 man-hours {{of maintenance}} for every <b>flying</b> <b>hour,</b> a figure {{described by the}} Canadian Naval Officers Association as 'grossly disproportionate'. Furthermore, the helicopters are unavailable for operations 40% {{of the time and}} due to the airframes being typically 10–15 years older than other operators' fleets, AIRCOM are often forced to have spare parts custom-made as Sikorsky's supplies are either overly expensive or out of production. Many observers regards AIRCOM's Sea Kings as unreliable, outdated and expensive to maintain. On February 27, 2003, when HMCS Iroquois was deploying to the Arabian Sea, a Sea King crashed shortly after takeoff, and images of the crashed helicopter lying on its side on the destroyer's landing pad were embarrassing. Late that year, the entire fleet was grounded (except for essential operations) for several weeks after two aircraft coincidentally lost power within days of each other.|$|E
25|$|Carey {{returned}} to England in 1947 to divorce {{his first wife}} and marry army nurse Bertha Kathleen Walters Jones, known as Kate. They married on 18 December 1947 in Stockton-On-Tees. On 9 January 1948 he was posted back to Germany in given command of 135 Wing at RAF Gütersloh. At this based Carey recorded his 2,000th <b>flying</b> <b>hour.</b> Carey also competed in air racing, organised by the RAF flying the de Havilland Vampire. In February 1949 Carey was appointed wing commander (administration) at RAF Thorney Island. On 18 August 1949 he was appointed wing commander (organisation) at No. 12 Group RAF, Fighter Command before being wing commander (operations) in Scotland on 2 July 1951. Several more appointments followed; from October 1952 he was Station Commander at RAF Honiley in England and from April 1953 was promoted to group captain and assigned to Fighter Command headquarters from January 1956.|$|E

25|$|In March 2011, it was {{projected}} that the fleet of 32 U-2s would be operated until 2015. In 2014, Lockheed Martin {{determined that the}} U-2S fleet has used only one-fifth of its design service life {{and is one of}} the youngest fleets within the USAF. In 2011 the USAF intended to replace the U-2 with the RQ-4 before fiscal year 2015; proposed legislation required any replacement to have lower operating costs. In January 2012 the USAF reportedly planned to end the RQ-4 Block 30 program and extend the U-2's service life until 2023. The RQ-4 Block 30 was kept in service due to political pressure over USAF objections, who state that the U-2 costs $2,380 per flight hour compared to the RQ-4's $6,710 as of early 2014. Critics have pointed out that the RQ-4's cameras and sensors are less capable, and a lack of all-weather operating capability; however, some of the U-2's sensors may be installed on the RQ-4. The RQ-4 Block 30's capabilities were planned to match the U-2's by FY 2016, the replacement effort is motivated by decreases in the RQ-4's cost per <b>flying</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|E

Difficulties with its avionics and the MA-8 fire-control system were experienced early on; typically the F-105 required 150 hours of maintenance for each <b>flying</b> <b>hour.</b> Most of these problems were addressed under Project Optimize. The lack of spares resulted in the entire F-105B fleet being briefly grounded in 1960. In 1964, modified F-105Bs with ballast replacing the cannon, fuselage and wing reinforcement for aerobatics, {{and the addition of}} a smoke generator, briefly flew with the United States Air Force Thunderbirds demonstration team. After only six shows, a fatal accident from overstressing the airframe led to the reintroduction of the F-100 Super Sabre.|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} {{packaged}} as a gatefold sleeve designed {{and illustrated by}} Roger Dean, who had also designed the art for Fragile, Close to the Edge (1972), and the band's first live album, Yessongs (1973). Each of them carried a loose narrative thread that Dean did not continue for Tales from Topographic Oceans. The album's design was discussed during an in-depth conversation Dean and Anderson had in 1973 during the band's flight from London to Tokyo via Anchorage, Alaska, during the Close to the Edge tour. Prior to the flight, Dean had completed the front cover to The View Over Atlantis (1969) by John Mitchell, and [...] "the wives and girlfriends made a cake ... and we all had some.

2500|$|Through FY 1961, {{the total}} cost of the B-58 program was $3 billion ($ billion in [...] dollars). A highly complex aircraft, it also {{required}} considerable maintenance, much of which required specialized equipment and ground personnel. For comparison, the average maintenance cost per <b>flying</b> <b>hour</b> for the B-47 was $361, for the B-52 it was $1,025 and for the B-58 it was $1,440. The B-58 also cost three times as much to operate as the B-52. The cost of maintaining and operating the two operational B-58 wings equaled that of six wings of B-52s. This included special detailed maintenance for the nose landing gear, which retracted in a complicated fashion to avoid the center payload. Further, compounding this, the B-58 had an unfavorably high accident rate: 26 B-58 aircraft were lost in accidents, 22.4% of total production. The SAC senior leadership had been doubtful about the aircraft type from the beginning, although its crews eventually became enthusiastic about the aircraft. General Curtis LeMay was never satisfied with the bomber and after a flight in one declared that it was too small, far too expensive to maintain in combat readiness and required an excessive number of aerial refuelings to complete a mission. Although the high altitude ferry range of the B-58 was better than the B-47, the lack of forward basing resulted in a requirement for more KC-135 tanker support.|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} annual <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> (AFH) per pilot is, like {{almost every other}} aspect of the KPAF, very hard to {{estimate}}. Most sources on the subject abstain from giving hard numbers, {{but all of them}} estimate the average annual <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> per pilot as being 'low' to 'very low'. The number of annual <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> is of course very important in estimating the individual skill and experience of the pilots of an air force: more annual <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> suggests better trained pilots. Most estimates present a rather grim picture: AFH per pilot for the KPAF are said to be only 15 or 25 hours per pilot each year - comparable to the <b>flying</b> <b>hours</b> of air forces in ex-Soviet countries in the early 1990s. In comparison, most NATO fighter pilots fly at least 150 hours a year. Ground training, both in classrooms, on instructional airframes or in a flight simulator can only substitute for 'the real thing' to a certain degree, and the low number of modern jet trainers in the KPAF arsenal points to a very modest amount of flying time for the formation of new pilots.|$|R
