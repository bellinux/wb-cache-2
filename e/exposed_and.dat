5|$|The core of {{the pyramid}} is made of roughly hewn {{limestone}} blocks {{similar to those of}} the main pyramid. These were disposed in two layers and finally clad with fine Tura limestone which fell victim to stone robbers. Consequently, the poor quality pyramid core was <b>exposed</b> <b>and</b> degradated rapidly with only the two lowest layers of the pyramid still visible today.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} halted in March 1989, {{for lack of}} funding, after costs had quickly {{escalated}} that January, from £35million to £230million. By this point huge sections of the building's roof had been removed, so that machinery could be taken out. Without a roof, the building's steel framework has been left <b>exposed</b> <b>and</b> its foundations have been prone to flooding.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm petrel}} breeds on <b>exposed</b> <b>and</b> usually {{uninhabited}} islands which it visits only at night. It otherwise frequents mid-depth waters {{away from the}} coastal zone, but not over the ocean deeps. In the breeding season, it is mainly found between the 10–25°C July isotherms. In Europe, it is rarely seen from land except in autumn storms.|$|E
5|$|A counterattack by {{elements}} of the 15th Panzer Division was launched in the afternoon of 15 July. The limited number of anti-tank guns present were <b>exposed</b> <b>and</b> quickly immobilised or forced to withdraw. This left the infantry to be surrounded and large numbers were forced to surrender. Some soldiers {{made it to the}} positions of 19th Battalion, but it too became surrounded. By nightfall, the brigade had been overrun. Only the 18th Battalion managed to escape largely intact. Of the 20th Battalion, nearly 200 men were taken prisoner.|$|E

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} sexual reproduction for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been <b>exposed</b> <b>and</b> competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E
5|$|Bonnie {{remained}} virtually stationary {{until the}} morning of September23 when it drifted very slowly to the west-southwest {{in response to the}} ridge. It also began to gradually weaken as the low-level center became <b>exposed</b> <b>and</b> the storm became poorly organized. Convection also diminished, and on the afternoon of September24, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm as it drifted over cooler waters. Bonnie continued to lose most of its deep convection during the day on September25 as it began to make a turn back around to the south. That evening, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{joined the}} French Revolutionary Wars in February 1793, {{but the news}} did not reach the Indian Ocean for four months. The {{immediate}} priority of the British squadron under Commodore William Cornwallis in British India was the capture of the French colonies in India, especially their main port of Pondicherry. Once the British had completed this operation {{at the end of}} August 1793, the squadron returned to Europe. This left British commerce in Eastern waters badly <b>exposed,</b> <b>and</b> privateers and warships operating from Isle de France captured a number of merchant vessels, including the large East Indiaman Princess Royal, which three privateer corvettes seized on 27 September in the Sunda Strait.|$|E

Fifty sisters are <b>exposed</b> <b>and</b> executed, while twenty are able to escape. Taking advantage of the weakened White Tower defenses following the Seanchan raid, the rebels prepare an immediate attack. Just before the attack is mounted, the Tower Aes Sedai announce that Elaida was captured in the Seanchan raid, {{and that they would}} have Egwene as their leader, the Amyrlin Seat. The rebels return and they begin rebuilding the Tower.|$|E
5|$|Hood's {{withdrawal}} to Barbados {{had left}} St Lucia <b>exposed,</b> <b>and</b> on 10May, the whole French fleet, less two ships-of-the-line landed 1200 troops at Gros Islet, a village {{at the northern}} end of the island. On the same day, the remaining two ships from the French fleet and 1300 troops sailed for Tobago. The British were able to repel the attacks on St Lucia so deGrasse decided to reinforce his attack on Tobago, diverting his fleet there on 25May and sending 3000 more troops from Martinique.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Gaddafi's {{government}} {{declared a}} state monopoly on foreign trade. Its increasingly radical reforms, coupled with {{the large amount of}} oil revenue being spent on foreign causes, generated discontent in Libya, particularly among the country's merchant class. In 1974, Libya saw its first civilian attack on Gaddafi's government when a Benghazi army building was bombed. Much of the opposition centred around the RCC member Omar Mehishi, and with fellow RCC member Bashir Saghir al-Hawaadi he began plotting a coup against Gaddafi. In 1975 their plot was <b>exposed</b> <b>and</b> the pair fled into exile, receiving asylum from Sadat's Egypt. In the aftermath only five RCC members remained, and power was further concentrated in Gaddafi's hands. This led to the RCC's official abolition in March 1977.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to her limitations {{with the human}} form, MacDonald points out that Potter's mastery in the depiction of rabbits attains full flower in The Flopsy Bunnies. Potter conveys the rabbits' thoughts and emotions with {{the position of the}} tail or the ear. Benjamin, Peter, his mother, and Flopsy all wear clothes, but Flopsy wears only an apron that exposes her tail and is thus incompletely clothed in comparison to her family and by human standards. But this incompleteness in dress permits her tail to be <b>exposed</b> <b>and</b> to precisely convey her apprehension as she approaches the house across the vast expanse of the lawn in search of her babies.|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{reached its}} peak {{intensity}} of 65mph (100km/h) around 8 a.m. (EDT) as it continued to become more organized. However, there were indications that it {{had already begun to}} weaken. Outflow towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm, a sign that dry air was entering the system. During the afternoon hours, the structure of Josephine began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll. By the late night, the center was almost completely <b>exposed</b> <b>and</b> only a band of convection persisted near the center.|$|E
5|$|Madonna {{has only}} {{performed}} this song live once, on The Virgin Tour in 1985. It {{was the first}} song of the second act of the show. Madonna wore a black, fringed micro-top and similar skirt, with her belly-button <b>exposed,</b> <b>and</b> a number of crucifixes in different sizes, hanging {{from different parts of}} her body. As the guitar intro of the song started, Madonna appeared on the side-stage and started dancing energetically, while flashlights fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened her jacket and sometimes straddled the steel structure present on the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main stage. It was included on the video release, titled , which was shot in Detroit.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon's plan envisaged {{that the}} Allies would throw many troops to envelop his right flank {{in order to}} cut the French {{communication}} line from Vienna. As a result, the Allies' centre and left flank would be <b>exposed</b> <b>and</b> become vulnerable. To encourage them to do so, Napoleon abandoned the strategic position on the Pratzen Heights, faking the weakness of his forces and his own caution. Meanwhile, Napoleon's main force was to be concealed in a dead ground opposite the Heights. According to the plan, the French troops would attack and recapture the Pratzen Heights, then from the Heights they would launch a decisive assault {{to the center of}} the Allied army, cripple them, and encircle them from the rear.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{met with}} the National Security Council on March 14 to review the options. The President was {{concerned}} that the mission would be <b>exposed</b> <b>and</b> wanted to proceed quickly. For that reason he ruled out involving the Pakistanis. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and other military officials expressed doubts as to whether bin Laden was in the compound, and whether a commando raid was worth the risk. At {{the end of the}} meeting, the president seemed to be leaning toward a bombing mission. Two U.S. Air Force officers were tasked with exploring that option further.|$|E

Raghu introduces a foreign woman to Ramadasu as his demanding wife, who forces his father to incur more debt until he is cornered by his creditors. Ramalingam's deception is <b>exposed,</b> <b>and</b> Ramadasu apologises for his misdeeds. Raghu and Leela reconcile; Raja marries Manjari, and Govindam marries Usha.|$|E
