40|$|The two {{experiments}} {{presented in}} this paper examine the effects of strategies and interference tasks on odor recognition. In the first experiment (an extension of Lyman and McDaniel’s study from 1986), participants were asked to smell 30 odors and to perform different elaborative tasks for each of them such as: (1) providing a name or a short definition; (2) creating an image; (3) describing a specific life episode; (4) simply smelling the odors. Results showed no effect of encoding tasks on the correct recognition of odors. In the second experiment, participants were exposed to either 15 olfactory stimuli, 15 visual stimuli (photographs of human faces), or 15 acoustic stimuli (environmental sounds). In the four sessions of the experiment, they had to recognize the stimuli whether in a no-interference condition, or in an intramodality, or in two <b>intermodalities</b> interfering conditions. Consistently with the literature, interference affects recognition for visual and acoustic material but has no effect on odor recognition. The results of both experiments and some other anomalies in olfactory memory are discussed and tentatively integrated into a single model. The main assumption is that memor...|$|R
40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] This study uses Indonesia as a local site for {{examining}} how the technology {{and nature of the}} Internet interact with political and cultural struggles. It also shows how the creation and assertion of identity on the Internet become a focal point of contests over power. Specifically, the study examines the role of the Internet in Indonesia in disseminating the message of radical fundamentalist Islamic groups and, in particular, their anti-Americanism. It argues that the Internet serves as a key tool of self-definition and collective action for these groups—it communicates the global identity of radical fundamentalism as a means of self-definition for local Islamic fundamentalist movements. Two case studies detail these phenomena. The first examines Internet use by Laskar Jihad, the radical militia group involved in the Maluku conflict. The second looks at how radical fundamentalist Islamic groups have used the Internet after 9 / 11 to disseminate charges that the United States and Israel are conspiring against Islam. By examining how information flowed from cyberspace to real space in both cases, this study shows that the Internet has potential as a site for the revival of primordial, ethno/religious, and communal identities as forms of resistance to domination by both "non-believers" and global actors such as the United States. Deploying the concepts of identity politics, meta-narratives, and collective action, the study examines how the Internet is used by Islamic radical-fundamentalist individuals and groups. It shows that the Internet plays a crucial yet indeterminate role in the milieus of politics, culture, and economic structure. In the case of Indonesia, the Internet has {{played a key role in}} creating and sustaining political legitimation, resistance, and identity projects among Islamic radical fundamentalists. It has also helped these groups transform their identity into social and political power capable of scaling up social responses to effect political transformations at national and global levels. The Internet is becoming a major factor in identity formation—one that can allow users to access global sources of information while interpreting that information in local identity contexts through key nodes and sources. Indeed, Islamic radical fundamentalism has shown that the Internet has the potential to facilitate identity formation—such as the global fundamentalist movement—that is not territorially bound. But this development does not mean that national and other local identities have become obsolete in cyberspace. The Internet facilitates multiple identities: It can strengthen national identity while also fostering a de-territorialized identity. Radical fundamentalist groups also use the Internet to bypass local/national authorities and, in so doing, establish a new de-territorialized pattern of hierarchy. In addition, the ways these groups use the Internet demonstrate a mass nature that dovetails with the reductionist tendency and simplicity of the meta-narratives and more specific narratives of conspiracy these groups endorse. This resonance between the Internet and reductionism explains how the Internet can greatly facilitate the dissemination of radical fundamentalist ideas and opinions. However, in a country such as Indonesia, in which most of the population is not yet connected to the Internet, the Internet also needs to be explicitly linked to other media in order to extend its influence. Using the <b>intermodalities</b> of media networks, various individuals and groups can create linkages that allow information originating from cyberspace to reach audiences beyond the Internet. The Internet and its linkages to other media have enabled the realization of new connections. Radical groups use the Internet as a trawling tool to reach potential members at local, national, and global levels. But the Indonesian cases also show that the Internet is not persuasive enough to mobilize people for extreme actions such as killing and murder. While the Internet helps to form and disseminate a resistance identity, it alone cannot easily transform that identity into jihad in the form of physical war...|$|R

Geographers consider a wide range of modes that may be grouped into three broad categories based on the medium they exploit: land, water and air.

This gives rise to marked differences in the ways the modes are deployed and used {{in different parts of the}} world.

50|$|The same {{sequence}} in reverse order is effected for loading, {{with the side}} slots being replaced by the retaining pins on the wagon.In the unloading cycle, the side slots of the corner fitting are as an achievement of the VIT project also partly funded by the European Union.Operating under the catenary, though disconnected during the operation for safety reasons, Metrocargo eliminates the cost and time associated with shunting (coupling and decoupling wagons, transfer to marshalling yards by diesel locos, train breakdown and composition) {{that take place in}} traditional terminals, where trains need to be removed from the electrified line for unloading. Metrocargo was originally developed as a technical means necessary for creating a network for the intermodal transport of containers and swap bodies, distributed over a territory. In the process, it proved to be very fast (projections show a 40 wagon train can be unloaded and reloaded in less than one hour), which opened up new business possibilities, typically shuttling load units between ports and dry-ports. The construction technology being modular, equipment can be planned according to available space and number of containers to be handled, and increased as necessary. Today the system is fitted with a stand-alone active safety system detecting human presence in the work area, (which means that sound alarms {{do not have to be}} used). This system has been developed within the VIT project.Metrocargo is perfectly consistent with the goal of minimising environmental impact, because both atmospheric and acoustic pollution are almost totally eliminated by the electrically powered automation system. There are no local GHG emissions other than by trucks servicing the terminal, and noise level is very low.Electro-mechanical parts and plant automation software for load/unload were subjected to an exhaustive stress test under the control of an independent entity with specific knowledge of automated plants: Functionality and performance of all components were analysed and data collected and validated. The two main applications of Metrocargo are distributed <b>intermodality</b> and Port to dry-port shuttling.|$|E

In a broad sense, intermodal transport can be viewed as the transport of goods and passengers by the use of several coordinated transport modes. In the first section of this paper, we study the different forms of <b>intermodality</b> and define more precisely what are the forms relevant to (<b>intermodality</b> with) air travel. We also address the issue of financing intermodal infrastructure, and of incentives for signing agreements on the part of operators. We turn next to the issue of the future of <b>intermodality.</b> The main difficulty appearing when analyzing <b>intermodality</b> lies in the large number of factors impacting its development and in their complex mutual influences. Determining how <b>intermodality</b> could develop requires to decompose the analysis in several steps. In part two, we identify factors directly or indirectly influencing the development of airport <b>intermodality</b> and perform a qualitative analysis showing the factors' complex relationships. This analysis will then be used in part three for building and analyzing different scenarios of <b>intermodality</b> evolution at airport. Finally, in part four, those scenarios will be applied to Portugal and France, which constitute today polar cases of transport network development in Europe...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} articulates {{a writing}} pedagogy {{based on a}} theory of <b>intermodality</b> to help writing instructors navigate the affordances and challenges of multimodal composition. Drawing from recent discoveries in neuroscience about how the brain makes meaning, I situate this pedagogy of <b>intermodality</b> – literally, “between the modes” – within the Rhetoric and Composition traditions of embodied rhetoric and visual/multi-sensory rhetoric. A pedagogy attuned to <b>intermodality</b> capitalizes on how the senses (“modes”) work together to create meaning when composing with sound, image, movement, and text. In addition to the five senses, <b>intermodality</b> also incorporates the cultural, social, and material aspects of meaning-making. This study focuses on my own writing classrooms as sites of inquiry for implementing <b>intermodality</b> at key points {{in the writing process}} – invention, revision, reflection, and moments of resistance – as students compose digital literacy narratives. The digital literacy narrative provides an ideal opportunity to study <b>intermodality</b> in the writing classroom because of its invitation for students to reflect critically on their perceptions of digital writing specifically and literacy more generally, and its ability to encourage students to (re) position themselves as agents in their own stories. The text describes the synergistic, imagistic, and embodied dimensions of a pedagogy of <b>intermodality</b> and suggests the increased avenues for student expression, analysis, and persuasion when writing digitally. A pedagogy of <b>intermodality</b> reinforces the embodied, sensory aspects of writing by opening students to the affiliative elements of writing such as emotion, memory, and experience. The dissertation argues that, coupled with more traditional rhetorical instruction, a writing pedagogy attentive to <b>intermodality</b> helps students construct and implement effective rhetorical decision-making processes as they compose multimodally.

Patients were prospectively studied with 2 DE and CMR performed contiguously. LV and RV strains were computed separately using 2 DE and CMR-FT. Segmental and global longitudinal strains (GLS) for the LV and RV were measured from four-chamber views; LV radial (global radial strain [GRS]) and circumferential strains (GCS) measured from short-axis views. <b>Intermodality</b> and interobserver agreements were examined. In 40 patients (20 TOF, mean age 23 years and 20 adult controls), LV, GCS showed narrowest <b>intermodality</b> limits of agreement (mean percentage error 9. 5 %), followed by GLS (16. 4 %). RV GLS had mean <b>intermodality</b> difference of 25. 7 %. GLS and GCS had acceptable interobserver agreement for the LV and RV with both 2 DE and CMR-FT, whereas GRS had high interobserver and <b>intermodality</b> variability.

40|$|Cities offer a {{wide range}} of {{different}} mobility options, including a dense public transport network and good conditions for walking and cycling. They provide good circumstances for people for using and combining different modes of transport in their everyday mobility in a flexible, individual and situational way. Particularly in larger cities, intermodal mobility plays an increasing role and is being discussed as crucial to minimize traffic congestion, emissions and demand for parking space. In our contribution we compare unimodal and intermodal travel modes and discuss the effects on accessibility and sustainability in cities, using the example of Berlin. Which infrastructure and spatial aspects are relevant in the context of <b>intermodality?</b> How does the use of different modes or mode combinations affect accessibility? To what extent does <b>intermodality</b> indeed enable a higher accessibility in cities in comparison to unimodal modes? How does <b>intermodality</b> perform with respect to indicators related to sustainability such as the emitted amount of CO 2, personal energy consumption, and price? Based on empirical survey data from Berlin and calculations with spatial accessibility indicators we present unimodal and intermodal travel modes’ performance by means of accessible locations and distance over time and set them against the frequency of using various unimodal and intermodal travel modes. In addition, other performance indicators for the different modes are given, including the emitted amount of CO 2, personal energy consumption, and price.
