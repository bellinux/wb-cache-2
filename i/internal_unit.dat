In particular the Vega, or 5th generation GCN, microarchitecture includes a number of major revisions to improve performance and compute capabilities.|$|E
2500|$|Amdahl Corporation's {{hardware}} {{implementation of}} System/370 compatible channels was quite different. A single <b>internal</b> <b>unit,</b> called the [...] "C-Unit", supported up to sixteen channels using {{the very same}} hardware for all supported channels. Two internal [...] "C-Units" [...] were possible, supporting up to 32 total channels. Each [...] "C-Unit" [...] independently performed a process generally called a [...] "shifting channel state processor" [...] (a type of [...] "barrel processor"), which implemented a specialized type of finite state machine (FSM). Each CPU cycle, every 32 nanoseconds in the 470/V6 and /V5 and every 26 nanoseconds in the 470/V7 and /V8, the [...] "C-unit" [...] read the complete status of next channel in priority sequence and its I/O Channel in-tags. The necessary actions defined by that channel's last state and its in-tags were performed: data was read from or written to main storage, the operating system program was interrupted if such interruption was specified by the channel program's Program Control Interrupt flag, and the [...] "C-Unit" [...] finally stored that channel's next state and set its I/O Channel out-tags, {{and then went on}} to the next lower priority channel. Preemption was possible, in some instances. Sufficient FIFO storage was provided within the [...] "C-Unit" [...] for all channels which were emulated by this FSM. Channels could be easily reconfigured to the customer's choice of IBM 2860 (selector) emulation, IBM 2870 (byte multiplexor) emulation or IBM 2880 (block multiplexor) emulation without any significant restrictions by using maintenance console commands. [...] "Two-byte interface" [...] was also supported as was [...] "Data-In/Data-Out" [...] and other high-performance IBM channel options. Built-in channel-to-channel adapters were also offered, called CCAs in Amdahl-speak, but called CTCs in IBM-speak. A real game-changer, and this forced IBM to redesign its mainframes to provide similar channel capability and flexibility. IBM's initial response was to include stripped-down Model 158s, operating in [...] "Channel Mode", only, as the Model 303x channel units. In the Amdahl [...] "C-unit" [...] any channel could be any type, 2860, 2870 or 2880, without reserving channels 0 and 4 for 2870s, as on some IBM models.|$|E

40|$|A fuzzy {{controller}} is usually designed by formulating {{the knowledge of}} a human expert into a set of linguistic variables and fuzzy rules. Among the most successful methods to automate the {{fuzzy controller}}s development process are evolutionary algorithms. In this work, we propose the Recurrent Fuzzy Voronoi (RFV) model, a representation for recurrent fuzzy systems. It {{is an extension of}} the FV model proposed by Kavka and Schoenauer that extends the application domain to include temporal problems. The FV model is a representation for fuzzy controllers based on Voronoi diagrams that can represent fuzzy systems with synergistic rules, fulfilling the ɛ-completeness property and providing a simple way to introduce a priory knowledge. In the proposed representation, the temporal relations are embedded by including <b>internal</b> <b>units</b> that provide feedback by connecting outputs to inputs. These <b>internal</b> <b>units</b> act as memory elements. In the RFV model, the semantic of the <b>internal</b> <b>units</b> can be specified together with the a priori rules. The geometric interpretation of the rules allows the use of geometric variational operators during the evolution. The representation and the algorithms are validated in two problems in the area of system identification and evolutionary robotics...|$|R

50|$|Cochlear {{implants}} {{have provided}} partial hearing {{to more than}} 120,000 persons worldwide as of 2008. The electrical stimulation is used in a cochlear implant to provide functional hearing in totally deafened persons. Cochlear implants include several subsystem components from the external speech processor and radio frequency (RF) transmission link to the internal receiver, stimulator, and electrode arrays. Modern cochlear implant research started in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1961, a crude single electrode device was implanted in two deaf patients and useful hearing with electric stimulation was reported. The first FDA approved complete single channel device was released in 1984.In cochlear implants, the sound is {{picked up by a}} microphone and transmitted to the behind-the-ear external processor to be converted to the digital data. The digitized data is then modulated on a radio frequency signal and transmitted to an antenna inside a headpiece. The data and power carrier are transmitted through a pair of coupled coils to the hermetically sealed <b>internal</b> <b>unit.</b> By extracting the power and demodulating the data, electric current commands are sent to the cochlea to stimulate the auditory nerve through microelectrodes. The key point is that the <b>internal</b> <b>unit</b> does not have a battery and it should be able to extract the required energy. Also to reduce the infection, data is transmitted wirelessly along with power. Inductively coupled coils are the best candidate for power and data telemetry. Parameters needed by the <b>internal</b> <b>unit</b> include the pulse amplitude, pulse duration, pulse gap, active electrode, and return electrode that are used to define a biphasic pulse and the stimulation mode. An example of the commercial devices include Nucleus 22 device that utilized a carrier frequency of 2.5 MHz and later in the newer revision called Nucleus 24 device, the carrier frequency was increased to 5 MHz. The <b>internal</b> <b>unit</b> in the cochlear implants is an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) chip that is responsible to ensure safe and reliable electric stimulation. Inside the ASIC chip, there is a forward pathway, a backward pathway, and control units. The forward pathway recovers digital information from the RF signal which includes stimulation parameters and some handshaking bits to reduce the communication error. The backward pathway usually includes a back telemetry voltagesampler that reads the voltage {{over a period of time}} on the recording electrode. The stimulator block is responsible to deliver predetermined current by external unit to the microelectrodes. This block includes a reference current and a digital to analog converter to transform digital commands to an analog current.|$|E
