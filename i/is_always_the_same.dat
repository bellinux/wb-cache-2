25|$|Many {{states have}} {{policies}} which protect {{the young and}} inexperienced by insulating them from liability {{even though they may}} have voluntarily committed themselves to unwise contracts. The age at which children achieve full contractual capacity varies from state to state but the principle <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Infants are not bound by many otherwise valid contracts, and their intention is irrelevant because of the legal incapacity imposed on them by the state of the domicile (the lex domicilii) or nationality (the lex patriae). This recognises a set of social values that requires exculpation even though there is relevant action and consent freely given.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{structure}} of present-day fire temples <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> There are no indigenous sources {{older than the}} 19th century that describe an Iranian fire temple (the 9th century theologian Manushchir observed {{that they had a}} standard floor plan, but what this might have been is unknown), and {{it is possible that the}} temples there today have features that are originally of Indian origin. (Stausberg, 2004:175,405) On entry one comes into a large space or hall where congregation (also non-religious) or special ceremonies may take place. Off to the side of this (or sometimes a floor level up or down) the devotee enters an anteroom smaller than the hall he/she has just passed through. Connected to this anteroom, or enclosed within it, but not visible from the hall, is the innermost sanctum (in Zoroastrian terminology, the atashgah, literally 'place of the fire' (Boyce, 1993:669-670) in which the actual fire-altar stands.|$|E
25|$|As such, the {{character}} of Montague seems to represent two separate historical personages in the play, and whilst this is not unusual in Shakespearean histories, {{the manner of the}} dual representation is. For example, in 1 Henry VI and 2 Henry VI, {{the character}} of Somerset represents both John Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset and his younger brother, Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset. Similarly, in 3 Henry VI, another character called Somerset represents both Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset and his younger brother Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset. However, both Somerset in 1 Henry VI and 2 Henry VI and Somerset in 3 Henry VI are presented as consistent characters within the play, i.e. Somerset in 1 Henry VI and 2 Henry VI does not represent John Beaufort sometimes and Edmund Beaufort at others; he is consistently the same character in the milieu of the play. The same is true of Somerset in 3 Henry VI; as a character, he <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> person.|$|E

25|$|Tuberous organs, {{the type}} of {{receptive}} organ used for electrocommunication, {{can be divided into}} two types, depending on the way information is encoded: time coders and amplitude coders. There are multiple forms of tuberous organs in each time and amplitude coders, and all weakly electric fish species possess at least one form of the two coders. Time coder fires phase-locked action potential (meaning, the waveform of the action potential <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>same)</b> at a fixed delay time after each outside transient is formed. Therefore, time coders neglect information about waveform and amplitude but focus on frequency of the signal and fire action potentials on a 1:1 basis to the outside transient. Amplitude coders, on the contrary, fire according to the EOD amplitude. While both wave-type and pulse-type fishes have amplitude coders, they fire in different ways: Receptors of wave-type fishes continuously fire at a rate according to their own EOD amplitude; on the other hand, receptors of pulse-type fishes fire burst of spikes to each EOD detected, and the number of spikes in each burst is correlated to the amplitude of the EOD. Tuberous electroreceptors show a V-shaped threshold tuning curve (similar to auditory system), which means that they are tuned to a particular frequency. This particular tuned-in frequency is usually closely matched to their own EOD frequency.|$|E

[...] The campaign of 1812, gives as it were in a magnifying glass a very clear illustration of the effect of the means specified under principles 3 and 4.

In Rađevina, the head of the household would lead a sheep into the house, place it between the ognjište and himself, and utter the wishes while striking the badnjak with a branch cut from it, before saying: [...] "We passed one fire, we are not afraid of another."
