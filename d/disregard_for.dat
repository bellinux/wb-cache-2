5|$|A {{large crowd}} gathers outside the Verona Arena in Italy, with eager fans queuing {{to watch the}} {{performance}} of Jordan (Ranbir Kapoor), a rock musician. Despite being mobbed, Jordan manages to escape and reach the arena. He shows a complete <b>disregard</b> <b>for</b> his fans, storms onto the stage {{in a fit of}} rage and starts strumming angrily on his guitar.|$|E
5|$|Caudillos like Facundo Quiroga are seen, at the {{beginning}} of the book, as the antithesis of education, high culture, and civil stability; barbarism was like a never ending litany of social ills. They are the agents of instability and chaos, destroying societies through their blatant <b>disregard</b> <b>for</b> humanity and social progress.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Isaacs' {{attempts}} to domesticate the infected {{have led to}} a new zombie breed that remembers basic things, such as how to use phones and cameras. Wesker's security officer, Captain Alexander Slater (Matthew Marsden), is adamant about Isaacs' <b>disregard</b> <b>for</b> Umbrella's regulations. Wesker, in private, informs Slater to keep watch on Isaacs' actions, and tells Slater that if Issacs disobeys orders, Slater should kill Isaacs.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the diverse}} range of {{accounting}} services and recent corporate collapses, attention has been drawn to ethical standards accepted within the accounting profession. These collapses {{have resulted in a}} widespread <b>disregard</b> <b>for</b> the reputation of the accounting profession. To combat the criticism and prevent fraudulent accounting, various accounting organizations and governments have developed regulations and remedies for improved ethics among the accounting profession.|$|E
5|$|Heyer {{frequently}} {{highlights the}} heroine's many masculine qualities, {{which include a}} fierce independence and a <b>disregard</b> <b>for</b> social mores. Modern literary critics have noted {{that the relationship between}} the protagonists is modelled on those of the latter 20th century, offering companionship and allowing both parties to retain a level of independence. The heroine's unwillingness to conform attracts the hero, rather than repels him.|$|E

40|$|The {{frequency}} equation of Timoshenko beam theory factorises for hinged-hinged end conditions, {{leading to a}} first and second spectrum of natural frequencies; the latter is largely inaccurate and can be isolated and <b>disregarded.</b> <b>For</b> the majority of other end conditions, when the {{frequency equation}} does not factorise, one may {{think in terms of}} pseudo-second spectrum contributions arising when evanescent waves become propagating above the cut-off frequency, and it is conjectured that these may have a corrupting effect on the frequency predictions. Comparisons with measured and simulated frequencies lead to the conclusion that Timoshenko predictions above the cut-off frequency should be <b>disregarded</b> <b>for</b> those end conditions for which the frequency equation does not factorise...|$|R

5|$|The {{absolute}} state paternalism of totalitarian regimes, which naturally {{gives rise}} to the dominance of the archaic paternalistic ethical concept in medical practice.

5|$|Today, Beebe's 1915 {{description}} of his hypothetical four-winged bird ancestor is regarded as prescient, {{and there is no}} doubt that Microraptor looks startlingly similar to the almost-century old Tetrapteryx illustrations. After its discovery, Microraptor had the effect of both reinvigorating the arboreal hypothesis as well as finally putting an end to the widespread acceptance of Heilmann's <b>disregard</b> <b>for</b> the Tetrapteryx theory.|$|E
5|$|During the 1768 Sejm, Repnin {{showed his}} <b>disregard</b> <b>for</b> local {{resistance}} by arranging the abduction and imprisonment of Kajetan Sołtyk, Józef A. Załuski, Wacław Rzewuski and Seweryn Rzewuski, all vocal opponents of foreign domination and the recently proclaimed policies. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had legally and practically become a protectorate of the Russian Empire. Nonetheless, several minor beneficial reforms were adopted, political {{rights of the}} religious minorities were restored {{and the need for}} more reforms was becoming increasingly recognized.|$|E

50|$|Mohoidae is {{a family}} of Hawaiian species of {{recently}} extinct, nectarivorous songbirds in the genera Moho (ōō) and Chaetoptila (kioea). These now extinct birds form their own family, representing the only complete extinction of an entire avian family in modern times, when the disputed family Turnagridae is <b>disregarded</b> <b>for</b> being invalid.|$|R
5|$|From the Albanian perspective, adopted also by Italian and Austrian {{sources of}} that time, the Northern Epirote {{movement}} was directly {{supported by the}} Greek state, {{with the help of}} a minority of inhabitants in the region, resulting in chaos and political instability in all of Albania. In Albanian historiography, the Protocol of Corfu is either scarcely mentioned or seen as an attempt to divide the Albanian state and proof of the Great Powers' <b>disregard</b> <b>for</b> Albania's national integrity.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Bean {{often seems}} unaware of basic {{aspects of the}} way the world works, and the {{programme}} usually features his attempts at what would normally be considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, interior decorating, or going to church. The humour largely comes from his original (and often absurd) solutions to problems and his total <b>disregard</b> <b>for</b> others when solving them, his pettiness, and occasional malevolence.|$|E
5|$|Next Stace {{explains}} {{that there are}} two orders of being: time (or the world) and eternity (or God), and these intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. He maintains these orders are distinct, so one order cannot dictate to the other. Here he says that he agrees with Kant, who made a distinction between the world of phenomena and the noumenon, although he is critical of Kant’s <b>disregard</b> <b>for</b> mystical experience.|$|E
50|$|The 250 {{members of}} the National Assembly are elected by {{proportional}} representation in a single nationwide constituency with a 5% electoral threshold (with the percentages calculated including the invalid and blank votes cast), although the threshold is <b>disregarded</b> <b>for</b> coalitions representing ethnic minorities. Seats are allocated using the d'Hondt method.|$|R
30|$|Second, {{while the}} time-aggregation {{correction}} might be <b>disregarded</b> <b>for</b> unemployment decomposition {{in a monthly}} survey, it is important when using a quarterly survey. It seems, however, that a continuous correction somehow overstates {{the importance of the}} job finding rate. In the particular case studied, a discrete monthly correction provides more consistent results.|$|R
50|$|All {{the other}} meters then {{are to be}} <b>disregarded</b> <b>for</b> the reasons stated, and also because they are metrical; but the paean should be retained, {{because it is the}} only one of the rhythms {{mentioned}} which is not adapted to a metrical system, so that it is most likely to be undetected.|$|R
5|$|Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, {{the head}} of the mining operation's {{security}} detail. Fiercely loyal to his military code, he has a profound <b>disregard</b> <b>for</b> Pandora's inhabitants that is evident in both his actions and his language. Lang had unsuccessfully auditioned for a role in Cameron's Aliens (1986), but the director remembered Lang and sought him for Avatar. Michael Biehn, who was in Aliens, read the script and watched some of the 3-D footage with Cameron, but was ultimately not cast in the role.|$|E
5|$|The Definite Synodical Platform was {{not enough}} to cause the Pennsylvania Ministerium to leave the General Synod, but it was a foretaste of things to come. When the Frankean Synod, a Lutheran church body noted for its {{progressive}} politics and its utter <b>disregard</b> <b>for</b> the Lutheran Confessions, was admitted to the General Synod, the leadership of the Ministerium had seen enough. At the 1864 gathering of the General Synod, at which the Frankeans were admitted, the delegates from the Ministerium left in protest. Unfortunately, the delegates left before the General Synod passed a resolution affirming and strengthening their commitment to the Augsburg Confession.|$|E
5|$|The Protocol of Corfu {{is often}} {{mentioned}} by Northern Epirote {{and human rights}} organizations when referring to the discrimination against the Greek minority in Albania. On the other hand, in Albanian historiography this agreement is scarcely mentioned or its interpretation is often grounded on different positions: {{it is seen as}} an attempt to divide the Albanian state and as a proof of the Great Powers' <b>disregard</b> <b>for</b> the national integrity of Albania.|$|E
