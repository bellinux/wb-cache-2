They translated the designs into sets of planed oak cross-sectional templates, which were given to the stone-cutters. Construction of cathedrals and major churches almost invariably started at the eastern arm, and then proceeded westwards, with towers erected last.|$|E

40|$|<b>Frost</b> <b>damages</b> develop when {{exposure}} overtakes frost vulnerability. Frost {{risk assessment}} therefore needs dynamic simulation of frost hardiness using temperature and photoperiod in interaction with developmental stage. Two models, including {{or not the}} effect of photoperiod were calibrated using five years of frost hardiness monitoring (2007 – 2012), in two locations (low and high elevation) for three walnut genotypes with contrasted phenology and maximum hardiness (Juglans regia cv Franquette, Juglans regia x nigra ‘Early’ and ‘Late’). The Photothermal model predicted more accurate values for all genotypes (Efficiency[*]=[*] 0. 879; RMSEP[*]=[*] 2. 55 [*]°C) than the Thermal model (Efficiency[*]=[*] 0. 801; RMSEP[*]=[*] 3. 24 [*]°C). Predicted <b>frost</b> <b>damages</b> were strongly correlated to minimum temperature of the freezing events (ρ[*]=[*]− 0. 983) rather than actual frost hardiness (ρ[*]=[*]− 0. 515), or ratio of phenological stage completion (ρ[*]=[*] 0. 336). Higher frost risks are consequently predicted during winter, at high elevation, whereas spring is only risky at low elevation in early genotypes exhibiting faster dehardening rate. However, early <b>frost</b> <b>damages,</b> although of lower value, may negatively affect fruit production the subsequent year (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 381, P[*]=[*] 0. 057).

25|$|In {{addition}} to providing water for plant growth and development, irrigation systems {{can also be used}} for alternative purposes. One of the most common is the dual application of fertilizer with water in a process known as fertigation. Commonly used in drip irrigation systems, this method allows similarly regulate control over how precisely how much fertilizer and nutrients that each vine receives. Another alternative use for sprinkler irrigation systems can occur during the threat of winter or spring time frost. When temperature drop below 32°F (0°C), the vine is at risk of developing <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> that could not only ruin the upcoming years harvest but also kill the vine. One preventive measure against <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> is to use the sprinkler irrigation system to coat the vines with a protective layer of water that freezes into ice. This layer of ice serves as insulation keeping the internal temperature of the vine from dropping below the freezing mark.|$|E
25|$|Trincheras {{served a}} number of {{purposes}} such as defense, homesites, and agriculture. Their agricultural purposes were to provide farmers a level planting surface and aid in preventing erosion, collecting and managing water, and preventing <b>frost</b> <b>damage.</b> Hillside agriculture in the small fields created by trincheras was often of secondary importance to floodplain farming. Trinchera agriculture was probably used to grow all crops. Southwestern Indian farmers often cultivated several different fields and crops in different locations and environments {{to reduce the risk}} of crop failure.

After bud break, the young shoots are very vulnerable to <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> with vineyard managers going to great lengths protect the fragile shoots should temperature dramatically drop below freezing. This can include setting up heaters or wind circulators in the vineyard to keep cold air from settling on the vines.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in various centers from Romania’s viticultural regions: winter frost, extreme temperatures during the growing season and summer droughts. Winter <b>frost</b> <b>damaging</b> the vine is a significant risk to grape production, mainly in the plains and lowlands to the foothills. The frequency of winter <b>frost</b> <b>damaging</b> the vine has increased during the last decades, in the context of climate change. Also, there has been found {{a significant increase in the}} number of hot days (Tmax > 30 °C) and very hot days (Tmax > 35 °C). The evolution of these extreme events was followed in Craiova, Constanta, Bucharest, Timisoara, Cluj-Napoca, Oradea and Iasi, between 1977 and 2015. The long term study (18 years) conducted in the experimental plantation of the University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Bucharest revealed their influence on vine. During the last two decades, there has been registered a trend of increasing the frequency and intensity of winter <b>frost,</b> <b>damaging</b> vine (Tmin 30 °C and > 35 °C) and droughts that adversely affect viticulture, production and quality of grapes and wine. The highest warming trends were observed for northern viticultural regions (Transylvania and Moldavia) and for the seaside. Although the intensification of heat waves increases sugar accumulation in the berries, they trigger a significant reduction in grape production and in titrable acidity, requiring corrections and resulting in unbalanced wines. Meanwhile, droughts trigger production decrease. To avoid negative effects on vine, it is necessary to take measures, both on a short, medium and long term...|$|R
25|$|It {{was under}} these auspices that the grapevine {{followed}} land prospector John Howe as he cut {{a path through}} the Australian wilderness from Sydney up to the overland area in what is now known as the (Lower) Hunter Valley proper in 1820. Today, the modern Putty Road between the cities of Windsor and Singleton follows Howe's exact path and is a major thoroughfare for wine tourists coming into the Hunter Valley from Sydney.

25|$|Lake breezes {{in spring}} tend to retard fruit bloom until the frost danger is past, {{and in the}} autumn delay the onset of fall frost, {{particularly}} on the south shore. Cool onshore winds also retard early bloom of plants and flowers until later in the spring season, protecting them from possible <b>frost</b> <b>damage.</b> Such microclimatic effects have enabled tender fruit production in a continental climate, with the southwest shore supporting a major fruit-growing area. Apples, cherries, pears, plums, and peaches are grown in many commercial orchards around Rochester. Between Stoney Creek and Niagara-on-the-Lake on the Niagara Peninsula is a major fruit-growing and wine-making area. The wine-growing region extends over the international border into Niagara and Orleans counties.

While drought can be a vinicultural hazard, most areas of California receive sufficient amounts of rainfall with the annual rainfall of wine regions north of San Francisco between 24-45inches (615–1150mm) and the more southern regions receiving 13-20inches. Winters are mild with little threat of <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> though springtime. To curb the threat of frost, vineyard owners will often employ the use of wind machines, sprinklers and smudge pots to protect the vines.|$|E

25|$|The general {{short-term}} {{effect of}} nitrogen fertilization on coniferous seedlings is to stimulate shoot growth {{more so than}} root growth (Armson and Carman 1961).

A presentation at the North American Forest Tree Nursery Soils Workshop at Syracuse in 1980 provided strong contrary evidence: Bob Eastman, President of the Western Maine Forest Nursery Co. stated that for 15 years he {{has been successful in}} avoiding winter “burn” to Norway spruce and white spruce in his nursery operation by fertilizing with 50-80lb/ac (56–90kg/ha) nitrogen in September, whereas previously winter burn had been experienced annually, often severely.

25|$|As oranges are {{sensitive}} to frost, there are different methods to prevent <b>frost</b> <b>damage</b> to crops and trees when subfreezing temperatures are expected. A common process is to spray the trees with water so as to cover them with {{a thin layer of}} ice that will stay just at the freezing point, insulating them even if air temperatures drop far lower. This is because water continues to lose heat as long as the environment is colder than it is, and so the water turning to ice in the environment cannot damage the trees. This practice, however, offers protection only for a very short time. Another procedure is burning fuel oil in smudge pots put between the trees. These devices burn {{with a great deal of}} particulate emission, so condensation of water vapour on the particulate soot prevents condensation on plants and raises the air temperature very slightly. Smudge pots were developed for the first time after a disastrous freeze in Southern California in January 1913 destroyed a whole crop.|$|E
25|$|Viticulture in Washington State {{is deeply}} {{influenced}} {{by the use of}} irrigation and the water rights associated with suitable vineyard land. Sourced from the major rivers that run through the area, most vineyards in Eastern Washington are irrigated though some vineyards (especially in the slightly wetter Walla Walla Valley near the Blue Mountains), but some have begun experimenting with dry farming. The ever-present threat of severe winter frost has influenced viticultural practices including the adoption of wind turbines to churn and circulate air in the vineyard. In the late 20th century, many producers began adapting Russian vine-training techniques for fan-training which promotes better air circulation among the vine so cold air doesn't settle on the vine. Due to the minimal risk exposure to phylloxera, some producers have opted to leave their vines ungrafted on its original rootstock since an exposed graft union is more vulnerable to <b>frost</b> <b>damage.</b> One benefit of the traditionally cold winters is that the grapevines are allowed to go into full dormancy, which allows the vines to shut down and conserve energy that will be vital {{at the beginning of the}} new growth cycle for the vine. The threat of freezing condition is the main viticultural hazard that vine growers need to concern themselves with since the lack of rainfall during the summer and autumn contribute to the dry, arid conditions that allows most of Washington vineyards to be relatively disease free.|$|E
