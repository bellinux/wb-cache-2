50|$|<b>Gestrinone</b> was {{introduced}} in 1986.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gestrinone</b> (brand names Dimetriose, Dimetrose, Nemestran) is a {{synthetic}} steroid {{that is used}} in the treatment of endometriosis. It has mixed progestogenic and antiprogestogenic, weak androgenic, antigonadotropic, and functional antiestrogen activity. <b>Gestrinone</b> is described as similar in action and effect to danazol, which is also used in the treatment of endometriosis, but is reported to have fewer androgenic side effects in comparison. Because of its anabolic effects, the use of <b>gestrinone</b> in competition has been banned by the International Olympic Committee.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gestrinone</b> is {{approved}} for {{and used in}} the treatment of endometriosis.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gestrinone</b> is or {{has been}} marketed under the brand names Dimetriose, Dimetrose, Dinone, Gestrin, and Nemestran.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gestrinone</b> is or {{has been}} marketed in Europe, Australia, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, though notably {{not in the}} United States.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of <b>gestrinone</b> is complex and multifaceted. It shows high affinity for the progesterone receptor (PR), as well as lower affinity for the androgen receptor (AR). The drug has mixed progestogenic and antiprogestogenic activity - that is, it is a partial agonist of the PR or a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) - and is a weak agonist of the AR, or an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS). Similarly to danazol, <b>gestrinone</b> acts as a weak antigonadotropin via activation of the PR and AR in the pituitary gland and suppresses the mid-cycle surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) during the menstrual cycle without affecting basal levels of these hormones. It also inhibits ovarian steroidogenesis and, via activation of the AR in the liver, decreases circulating levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), thereby resulting in increased levels of free testosterone. In addition to the PR and AR, <b>gestrinone</b> {{has been found to}} bind to the estrogen receptor (ER) with relatively [...] "avid" [...] affinity. The drug has functional antiestrogenic activity in the endometrium. Unlike danazol, <b>gestrinone</b> does not appear to bind to SHBG or corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG).|$|E
50|$|<b>Gestrinone</b> is well-absorbed with oral administration, is metabolized by the liver, {{and has a}} {{terminal}} half-life of about 24 hours. It is eliminated in urine and feces.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gestrinone,</b> {{also known}} as 17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nor-δ9,11-testosterone, as well as 17α-ethynyl-18-methylestra-4,9,11-trien-17β-ol-3-one or as 13β-ethyl-18,19-dinor-17α-pregna-4,9,11-trien-20-yn-17β-ol-3-one), is a {{synthetic}} estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is more specifically a derivative of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) {{and is a member}} of the gonane (18-methylestrane) subgroup of the 19-nortestosterone family of progestins. <b>Gestrinone</b> is the C18 methyl derivative of norgestrienone (17α-ethynyl-19-nor-δ9,11-testosterone) and the δ9,11 analogue of levonorgestrel (17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone) and is {{also known as}} ethylnorgestrienone due to the fact that it is the C13β ethyl variant of norgestrienone. It is also the C17α ethynyl and C18 methyl derivative of the AAS trenbolone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gestrinone</b> {{has also}} been {{investigated}} {{for use as a}} prospective contraceptive agent and as a postcoital contraceptive. It also has been used to shrink uterine fibroids and to reduce menorrhagia.|$|E
50|$|Side {{effects of}} <b>gestrinone</b> include vaginal spotting, and, in {{susceptible}} individuals, signs of increased androgen activity such as acne, oily skin, fluid retention, weight gain, hirsutism, voice change, or hair loss.|$|E
5000|$|Danazol (danocrine) and <b>gestrinone</b> are suppressive steroids {{with some}} {{androgenic}} activity. Both agents inhibit {{the growth of}} endometriosis but their use remains limited as they may cause hirsutism and voice changes.|$|E
50|$|Norsteroid {{examples}} include: 19-norpregnane (from pregnane), desogestrel, ethylestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, ethinylestradiol, <b>gestrinone,</b> levonorgestrel, norethisterone (norethindrone), norgestrel, norpregnatriene (from pregnatriene), quinestrol, 19-norprogesterone (from a progesterone), Nomegestrol acetate, 19-nortestosterone (from a testosterone), and norethisterone acetate.|$|E
50|$|The {{androgenic}} {{properties of}} <b>gestrinone</b> are more exploited in its derivative tetrahydrogestrinone (THG; 17α-ethyl-18-methyl-δ9,11-19-nortestosterone), a designer steroid {{which is far}} more potent as both an AAS and progestogen in comparison. THG was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2003.|$|E
50|$|THG was {{developed}} by Patrick Arnold for the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), which {{claimed to be a}} nutritional supplement company. The company manufactured the drug through palladium-charcoal catalyzed hydrogenation from <b>gestrinone,</b> a substance used in gynecology for treatment of endometriosis (Australian Medicines handbook 2011).|$|E
50|$|Such {{conditions}} may {{be treated with}} drugs with antiestrogen actions, including selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen and clomifene, estrogen receptor antagonists such as fulvestrant, aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole and exemestane, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues such as leuprolide and cetrorelix, and/or other antigonadotropins such as danazol, <b>gestrinone,</b> megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone acetate.|$|E
50|$|THG was {{developed}} completely in secret by Arnold {{as a designer}} drug, {{on the basis that}} doping testers would be unlikely to detect a totally new compound. Arnold developed a chemical similar to two obscure steroids marketed by BALCO, norbolethone and desoxymethyltestosterone, which had been reported in scientific literature but never entered mass production, and the banned anabolic steroids trenbolone and <b>gestrinone,</b> the latter of which was used to synthesize it.|$|E
50|$|THG, {{also known}} as 17α-ethyl-18-methyl-δ9,11-19-nortestosterone or as 17α-ethyl-18-methylestra-4,9,11-trien-17β-ol-3-one, is a {{synthetic}} estrane steroid and a 17α-alkylated derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone). It is a modification of <b>gestrinone</b> (17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nor-δ9,11-testosterone) in which the ethynyl group has been hydrogenated into an ethyl group, thereby converting the steroid from a norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) derivative with weak AR activity into a norethandrolone (17α-ethyl-19-nortestosterone) derivative with powerful AR activity. THG {{is closely related to}} trenbolone (δ9,11-19-nortestosterone), metribolone (17α-methyl-δ9,11-19-nortestosterone), and norboletone (17α-ethyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone).|$|E
50|$|Among the {{testosterone}} derivatives, and in {{no particular}} order, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norgestrienone, ethisterone, <b>gestrinone,</b> danazol, tibolone, normethandrone, and norvinisterone have the greatest androgenic activity, while norethisterone and its prodrugs (norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and quingestanol acetate) have moderate activity. Testosterone derivatives with low (but potentially still significant) androgenic activity include desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, and norgestimate, while norelgestromin, noretynodrel, norgesterone, allylestrenol, and dimethisterone appear to have negligible activity. Dienogest and oxendolone are unique among the testosterone derivatives {{in that they are}} potent antiandrogens.|$|E
50|$|Norgestrienone (INN) (brand name Ogyline, Planor, Miniplanor; former {{developmental}} {{code name}} RU-2010), {{also known as}} Δ9,11-norethisterone or 17α-ethynyltrienolone (17α-ethynyltrenbolone), as well as 17α-ethynylestra-4,9,11-trien-17β-ol-3-one, is a steroidal progestin related to norethisterone that {{is used as a}} hormonal contraceptive, sometimes in combination with ethinylestradiol. It was developed by Roussel Uclaf and is registered for use only in France. Under the brand name Planor, it is or was marketed in France as 2 mg norgestrienone and 50 μg ethinylestradiol tablets. Norgestrienone has been found to possess similar affinity for the progesterone receptor and androgen receptor, and in accordance, has some androgenic activity. The drug was first described in the literature in 1965. <b>Gestrinone</b> is the 13β-ethyl variant or 18-methyl derivative of norgestrienone.|$|E
50|$|The most {{well-known}} and widely used antigonadotropins are the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues (both agonists and antagonists). However, many other drugs have antigonadotropic properties as well, including compounds acting on sex steroid hormone receptors such as progestogens, androgens, and estrogens (due to negative {{feedback on the}} HPG axis), as well as steroid synthesis inhibitors such as danazol and <b>gestrinone.</b> Some antigonadotropins have a multimodal action, such as cyproterone acetate, which exerts its effects via acting as an antiandrogen, progestin, and steroid synthesis inhibitor. Since progestins have relatively little effect on sexual differentiation {{compared to the other}} sex steroids, potent ones such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and chlormadinone acetate are often used at high doses specifically for their antigonadotropic effects.|$|E
50|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{are frequently}} used first {{in patients with}} pelvic pain, particularly if the diagnosis of endometriosis has not been definitively (excision and biopsy) established. The goal of directed medical treatment is to achieve an anovulatory state. Typically, this is achieved initially using hormonal contraception. This can also be accomplished with progestational agents (i.e., medroxyprogesterone acetate), danazol, <b>gestrinone,</b> or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH), {{as well as other}} less well-known agents. These agents are generally used if oral contraceptives and NSAIDs are ineffective. GnRH can be combined with estrogen and progestogen (add-back therapy) without loss of efficacy but with fewer hypoestrogenic symptoms. These medications are often ineffective in treating endometriomas and any relief is short lived while taking the medications. Hormonal treatment has a large number of sometimes permanent side effects, such as hot flushes, loss of bone mass, deepening of voice, weight gain, and facial hair growth.|$|E
40|$|An open {{comparative}} study of <b>gestrinone</b> and danazol {{in the treatment of}} endometriosis demonstrated a similar decrease in the extent of active endometriotic deposits, assessed visually following therapy. Biochemical endocrinological changes during therapy with <b>gestrinone</b> showed that basal concentrations of gonadotrophin remained unchanged, oestradiol concentrations varied and the free fraction of testosterone increased. A similar range of side effects was reported in both treatment groups, consisting predominantly of ‘androgenic’ effects in 10 of 15 women treated with <b>gestrinone</b> and 5 of 12 treated with danazol. The results suggest that <b>gestrinone</b> is an effective alternative agent for the treatment of endometriosis...|$|E
40|$|A new drug, <b>gestrinone,</b> was {{subjected}} to the first double blind, randomised placebo controlled trial of any treatment of endometriosis. The disease deteriorated in eight (47 %) of the 17 patients prescribed placebo (95 % confidence limits 23 % and 71 %) compared {{with none of the}} 18 patients prescribed <b>gestrinone</b> (p = 0. 002). There was a difference in elimination of the endometriosis in the <b>gestrinone</b> group compared with placebo but this was not statistically significant (p = 0. 057). There was a significant difference in improvement of the disease in the <b>gestrinone</b> group compared with placebo (p = 0. 004), confirming that <b>gestrinone</b> is an effective treatment of endometriosis. Endometriosis deteriorates in at least 23 % of patients; as it is impossible to predict in whom this will happen, treatment appears to be warranted in all cases...|$|E
40|$|<b>Gestrinone</b> {{has been}} shown to reduce uterine volume and stop {{bleeding}} in women with uterine leiomyomata. In the present study, we demonstrated a reduction in the volume of uterine myomas and in the uterine artery blood perfusion over a 6 -month period of <b>gestrinone</b> administration in premenopausal women...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} <b>gestrinone</b> versus leuprolide acetate (LA) in improving pelvic pain in women with endometriosis and to compare their effects on bone mineral density and serum lipid profile. Design: Multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized clinical trial. Setting: Six academic departments specialized {{in the study of}} endometriosis. Patient(s) : Fifty-five women with moderate or severe pelvic pain and laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis. Intervention(s) : Six-month treatment with oral <b>gestrinone</b> (n = 27) or IM depot LA (n = 28) followed by 6 -month follow-up. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Variations in severity of dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, and nonmenstrual pain as shown by a visual analog scale and a verbal rating scale, modifications in bone mineral content as shown by dual-roentgenogram absorptiometry, and variations in serum cholesterol subfractions and lipoprotein(a) concentrations. Result(s) : Significant improvements were observed in all three symptoms considered in both treatment arms. Moderate or severe pain symptoms recurrence on both pain scales was observed in 2 of 17 (11. 8 %) patients given <b>gestrinone</b> compared with 9 of 17 (52. 9 %) of those given LA (odds ratio, 0. 12; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 02 to 0. 69). Lumbar bone mineral density increased slightly in the <b>gestrinone</b> group but decreased by 3 % in the LA one. High-density-lipoprotein cholesterol fell by 25 % and lipoprotein(a) decreased by approximately 40 % in the gestrinone-treated women but did not vary in those receiving LA. Conclusion(s) : Oral <b>gestrinone</b> is at least as effective as depot LA for pain relief in women with symptomatic endometriosis. A tendency to prolonged pain reduction was observed after <b>gestrinone</b> compared with LA treatment. <b>Gestrinone</b> does not negatively affect bone density but variations in serum lipids need further evaluation...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess {{adequately}} the effectiveness of danazol, <b>Gestrinone,</b> and Buserelin, a prospective nonrandomized study was initiated in 126 patients with laparoscopically confirmed ovarian endometriosis. After hormonal therapy, laparotomy with microsurgical resection of endometriotic cysts was carried out. Regression (greater than 25 %) of ovarian endometriosis was noted in 30 %, 34 %, and 73 % of cases after danazol, <b>Gestrinone,</b> and Buserelin, respectively. The pregnancy rate in moderate endometriosis (53 %) differed significantly from the rate obtained in severe endometriosis (45 %). The highest percentages were found after Buserelin therapy. In conclusion, Buserelin emerged superior to danazol or <b>Gestrinone</b> treatment. Nevertheless, hormonal treatment leads to an incomplete suppression of ovarian endometriotic implants and this suggests the necessity of surgically removing invasive ovarian endometriosis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} estrogen treatment in combination with <b>gestrinone</b> on an experimental rat model of endometriosis. METHODS: Uterine transplants were attached to the peritoneum of female Wistar rats via a surgical autotransplantation technique. The implanted area was measured during the proestrus phase and after hormonal treatment. We performed morphometric analysis and examined the macroscopic and morphometric alterations of endometrial implants after hormonal treatment in ovariectomized rats. RESULTS: The high dose of estrogen caused macroscopic increases in the endometrial implant group compared with other groups, which were similar to increases in the proestrus phase. The low dose showed morphometric development of implants, such as an increase in number of endometrial glands, leukocyte infiltration and mitosis. <b>Gestrinone</b> antagonized both doses of estrogen. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that <b>gestrinone</b> antagonizes estrogen's effects on rat peritoneal endometrial implants.

40|$|In an open-label, multicentre, randomized, {{parallel}} group study, 164 {{women with}} endometriosis {{were assigned to}} treatment. Out of these women, 81 received danazol (600 mg daily for 8 weeks, then 400 mg for 16 weeks) and 83 were given <b>gestrinone</b> (2. 5 mg twice a week for 24 weeks). Five weeks {{before the start of}} treatment clinical evaluation and diagnostic laparoscopy were performed during the screening visit. Drug assignment and laboratory data assessment were carried out within 3 days of the estimated onset of the menstrual cycle at baseline visit. the response to treatment was assessed during visits at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24; at the last visit a second laparoscopy was performed. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by analysis of the laparoscopic scores assessed according to the revised American Fertility Society classification. Symptomatic response was measured by clinical scores and laboratory data. in one centre, bone mineral density was also recorded. One patient in the danazol group discontinued treatment due to a cutaneous rash as a probable adverse reaction {{at the beginning of the}} study. the therapeutic efficacy of danazol and <b>gestrinone</b> did not differ significantly when the revised American Fertility Society scores were compared. the symptomatic response also showed no statistical difference when clinical examination scores were analysed. There was no significant difference between the drugs in laboratory data, including bone mineral density, with respect to adverse events. Analysis of clinical scores showed that danazol was superior to <b>gestrinone</b> with respect to acne and irregular bleeding. Based on these data, we conclude that both danazol and <b>gestrinone</b> are reliable in the treatment of endometriosis and offer similar results.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{adequately}} assess {{the effectiveness of}} danazol, <b>gestrinone,</b> buserelin-nasal spray (IN) and buserelin-implant (SC), a prospective non randomized study was initiated in 178 patients with laparoscopically confirmed ovarian endometriosis. After hormonal therapy, laparotomy with microsurgical resection of endometriotic cysts or laparoscopy laser was carried out. Regression (greater than 25 %) of ovarian endometriosis was noted in 30, 34, 73 and 91 % of cases after danazol, <b>gestrinone</b> and buserelin IN and buserelin SC respectively. Histological study proves that hormonal treatment leads to an incomplete suppression of ovarian endometriotic implants and this suggests the necessity to remove surgically invasive ovarian endometriosis. The pregnancy rate in moderate endometriosis (55 %) differed significantly from the rate obtained in severe endometriosis (44 %). The highest percentages were found after buserelin therapy.

40|$|The {{relation}} between asymptomatic endometriosis and infertility {{was investigated in}} a randomised double blind placebo controlled trial {{of the impact of}} treating the endometriosis with <b>gestrinone.</b> The 12 month cumulative conception rate in those patients treated with <b>gestrinone</b> was 25 % (5 / 20) and in those given placebo 24 % (4 / 17). These same patients were divided into those in whom no visible endometriosis was present at the second laparoscopy and those in whom residual disease was present and the 12 month cumulative conception rates were 25 % (4 / 16) and 30 % (6 / 20) respectively. None of these rates differed significantly, and they compared with a rate of 23 % (6 / 26) in a control group of patients with unexplained infertility. Those patients in whom the disease was eliminated did not return to normal fertility, though all other causes of infertility were excluded. This study failed to show any impact of treatment or the absence or presence of asymptomatic endometriosis on future fertility compared with patients with unexplained infertility. The findings therefore question any causal role of the disease in infertility...|$|E
30|$|Several medical {{strategies}} {{are available for}} treating endometriosis. These include combined oral contraceptive pills, progestogens, Danazol, <b>gestrinone,</b> and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRH-a) with or without add-back therapy. Of these, the two main drugs used are GnRH-a and, until recently, Danazol. Both {{have been shown to}} decrease symptoms when compared with placebo [6, 7]. A large Cochrane metaanalysis of 26 randomised controlled trials confirmed GnRH-a to be effective in relieving pain [8, 9].

40|$|Objective. To {{systematically}} {{evaluate the}} efficacy {{and safety of}} Dan’e-fukang soft extract in endometriosis treatment. Method. PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang Database, VIP, SinoMed, and Cochrane Library were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of Dan’e-fukang soft extract and conventional western medicines for endometriosis treatment were included. The data were extracted independently by two people and analyzed using RevMan 5. 2. 0 software. The relative risk (RR) and mean difference (MD) with 95 % confidence intervals were considered as effective outcome indicators. Results. Thirty-nine papers including 5442 patients with endometriosis were included in this study. A meta-analysis revealed that Dan’e-fukang soft extract was more efficient than <b>gestrinone</b> {{in the treatment of}} endometriosis (RR = 1. 08, 95 % CI = 1. 03 to 1. 15, I 2 = 71 %, REM, 18 trials) and its efficacy was comparable to that of danazol and mifepristone. Dan’e-fukang soft extract was also as effective as <b>gestrinone</b> and mifepristone in terms of relapse rate and relieving dysmenorrhea. The incidence of adverse reactions was lower than that of conventional western medicines. Conclusions.

40|$|The use of anabolic-androgenic steroids (AASs) in {{the world}} of sport has raised a major concern for the serious, {{sometimes}} life-threatening, side effects associated with these drugs. Most of the CNS effects are of psychiatric origin, and whether or not AASs are toxic to neurons is yet unknown. We compared the effect of testosterone with that of the AASs, 19 -nortestosterone (nandrolone), stanozolol, and <b>gestrinone,</b> on excitotoxic neuronal death induced by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) in primary cultures of mouse cortical cells. In the most relevant experiments, steroids were applied to the cultures once daily during the 4 days preceding the NMDA pulse. Under these conditions, testosterone amplified excitotoxic neuronal death only at very high concentrations (10 muM), whereas it was protective at concentrations of 10 nM and inactive at intermediate concentrations. Low concentrations of testosterone became neurotoxic {{in the presence of the}} aromatase inhibitors, i. e. anastrozole and aminoglutethimide, suggesting that the intrinsic toxicity of testosterone was counterbalanced by its aromatization into 17 beta-estradiol. As opposed to testosterone, nortestosterone, stanozolol and <b>gestrinone</b> amplified NMDA toxicity at nanomolar concentrations; their action was insensitive to aromatase inhibitors, but was abrogated by the androgen receptor antagonist, flutamide. None of the AASs were toxic in the absence of NMDA. These data suggest that AASs increase neuronal vulnerability to an excitotoxic insult and may therefore facilitate neuronal death associated with acute or chronic CNS disorders...|$|E
