50|$|The rapid <b>furfural</b> <b>test</b> is a {{chemical}} test used {{to distinguish between}} glucose and fructose. The rapid <b>furfural</b> <b>test</b> is similar to Molisch's test but uses concentrated hydrochloric acid instead of concentrated sulfuric acid and the solution is boiled. Dilute sugar solution is added to ethanolic 1-Naphthol and concentrated hydrochloric acid. The solution is then boiled and if a purple colour forms within thirty seconds, fructose is present. If a purple colour doesn't appear before thirty seconds, glucose is present.|$|E
50|$|In Molisch's test, 1-naphthol {{dissolved}} in ethanol, known as Molisch's reagent, {{is used as}} reagent for detecting the presence of carbohydrates. The test known as Molisch's test would give a red- or purple-colored compound to indicate the presence of carbohydrate. The rapid <b>furfural</b> <b>test,</b> similar to Molisch's test, also uses 1-naphthol.|$|E
40|$|It {{was found}} in earlier {{investigations}} by Masing (1, 2), by Brachet (3), and by Sehmidt (4) that the eggs of Arbacia and other sea urchins contain large amounts of nucleic acids. During {{the early stages of}} development (up to the gastrula stage) the increase of the total nucleic acid content of the embryo is small in comparison to the initial nucleic acid content despite the formation {{of a large number of}} cell nuclei. In these respects the sea urchin eggs differ fundamentally from avian eggs which contain only extremely small amounts of nucleic acids before fertilization but form large amounts of these compounds during the'tr development. Brachet observed that unfertilized sea urchin eggs give only very weak Dische tests (5) but very strong <b>furfural</b> <b>tests</b> after being heated with strong hydrochloric acid. He concluded from these facts that the nucleic acid of the unfertilized sea urchin eggs (Paracentro~s) is mainly ribonucleic acid. This interpretation is confirmed ill the present paper by the appheation of improved analytical methods. (An earlier statement to the contrary by Schmidt (4...|$|R
40|$|Cornsilk {{contains}} various beneficial phytochemical compounds. There are {{claims that}} cornsilk exhibits various biological activities in vivo. The {{aim of the}} present study was to determine the cornsilk bioactive compounds and the cytotoxicity effect of cornsilk extract on brine shrimp. Cornsilk was extracted using different solvents with single extraction procedures. All phytochemical compounds samples were identified via GC-MS equipment. The brine shrimp toxicity test was observed to obtain LC 50 value for both extracts. Eleven compounds were identified in the aqueous extract of cornsilk (AEC) while methanolic extract of cornsilk (MEC) contained 4 compounds. These compounds consist of cyclopentane-ethyl, 2 -methylheptane, furfural, furfuryl alcohol, furfuryl- 5 -methyl, 1 -naphtol, lactone-G, cis- 2 -pentenal, pyranone, hydroxymethyl furfural and palmitic acid. There was only 1 similar compound found in both extracts which was the hydroxymethyl <b>furfural.</b> Cytotoxicity <b>test</b> showed that cornsilk is non toxic. The LC 50 values found in AEC and MEC were 3151. 34 and 1350. 65, respectively. Our result found that cornsilk contained various bioactive compounds which positively supported most of the therapeutic activity claimed. In brief, the cytotoxicity test shows that cornsilk is non toxic for human consumption due to its high LC 50 value...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to compare the {{production}} of carotenes and ergosterol by red yeasts grown on pine lignocellulose substrates. The yeast strains Rhodotorula aurantiaca and Sporobolomyces shibatanus were grown on the liquid fraction of steam pretreated pine (210 °C, catalyst SO 2). Biomass production on a pine hydrolysate was lower than on glucose. The highest content of carotenoids and ergosterol in the cells of R. aurantiaca grown on pine hydrolysate was about 1. 7 mg g– 1 and 0. 8 mg g– 1 (dwt), respectively, and in S. shibatanus about 0. 9 mg g– 1 and 0. 1 mg g– 1, respectively. Hemicellulose hydrolysates may contain many compounds that have inhibitory effects on microorganisms. In this work, the influences of some inhibitors were assessed by cultivating yeasts on media with a representative addition of the selected compounds. From these <b>tests,</b> <b>furfural</b> {{appears to be the}} most critical inhibitor, whereas acetic acid and 5 -hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) do not affect the growth so much...|$|R
30|$|Conversion of glucose and xylose was not {{completely}} inhibited for the hydrolysates BGX and CGX, {{in the presence of}} known inhibitors such as acetate, HMF and furfural. Our study shows that the favorable growth condition for cell mass production is likely due to the mixed sugars, where glucose is converted more readily than xylose. Our results compare favorably with previous reports on fermentation of sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate (Rudolf et al. 2008). In contrast, Bellido et al. (2011) found that xylose was not utilized in 168  h of fermentation experiments using Scheffersomyces (Pichia) stipitis DSM 3651 on filtered hydrolysate of steam exploded wheat straw using the whole slurry with acetate, HMF and furfural concentrations at 1.52, 0.05 and 0.14  g/l, respectively. Acetic acid is released from the esterified form of arabinoxylans during the processing of lignocellulose hydrolysate. The cleavage of the acetyl group occurs when lignocellulose undergoes high temperature, oxidation treatment and even in enzymatic hydrolysis process we further see a liberation of acetic acid. Previous studies showed the yeast cell growth is inhibited at an acetic acid concentration of about 2 – 5  g/l (Bellido et al. 2011; Nigam 2001 a). Acetic acid is a weak acid having high pKa value of 4.75 (25 °C) at zero ionic strength. pKa value refers to the pH value at which buffering capacity of the acid is highest and the concentration of dissociated and undissociated form of the acid are equal (Palmqvist and Hahn-Hägerdal 2000). The risk of inhibition due to liposoluble diffusion of undissociated weak acid across the plasma membrane can be reduced by increasing the pH (Palmqvist and Hahn-Hägerdal 2000). Therefore, favorable pH for the fermentation of the hydrolysates containing acetic acid will be between 5.5 and 6.5. Our study suggests that acetic acid can be utilized by S. stipitis as a substrate at a lower concentration that may not be inhibitory for cell growth at starting pH between 6.0 and 6.5. A similar observation of acetic acid conversion by Scheffersomyces (Pichia) stipitis was also reported (Agbogbo and Wenger 2007) during fermentation of corn stover hydrolysate. The product formed from acetic acid metabolism by S. stipitis CBS 6054 is unknown. HMF and furfural are produced during the processing of hydrolysate, by degradation of hexose and pentose sugars, respectively. Apparently, the tested concentration levels of HMF and furfural were not affecting the fermentation and growth of S. stipitis CBS 6054. Yeasts including S. stipitis can metabolize furfural to furfuryl alcohol and the enzyme NADH- dependent yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is responsible for the reduction (Huang et al. 2009). In the present investigation, HMF and furfural were completely metabolized by the strain before significant utilization of sugars started. This was also previously reported by others (Almeida et al. 2008; Wan et al. 2012) and indicates that S. stipitis CBS 6054 is readily capable of converting HMF and <b>furfural</b> in the <b>tested</b> lignocellulose hydrolysate from sugarcane bagasse. Cell growth was highest (0.079  g/l/h) in hydrolysate containing mixed sugars and inhibitors such as acetate, HMF and furfural at concentrations of 3.2 [*]±[*] 0.1, 0.4 and 0.5  g/l, respectively, indicating that the processing of bagasse hydrolysate under this condition will not inhibit the growth of S. stipitis.|$|R
