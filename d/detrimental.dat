5|$|The {{fourth stage}} can be <b>detrimental,</b> as Johnson cites it as a risk for {{premature}} death. As a person now drinks to feel normal, they {{block out the}} feelings of overwhelming guilt, remorse, anxiety, and shame they experience when sober.|$|E
5|$|Torn was {{to contain}} {{four types of}} magic: Chaos, Order, Alchemy and Summoning. Order magic {{primarily}} consisted of healing, protective, and empowering spells. Conversely, Chaos magic was to have consisted of harmful elemental attacks, <b>detrimental</b> status afflictions, and invisibility spells.|$|E
5|$|A British {{beekeeper}} successfully {{developed a}} strain of bees that are resistant to varroa mites. Russian honey bees also resist infestations of varroa mites but are still susceptible to other factors associated with colony collapse disorder, and have <b>detrimental</b> traits that limit their relevance in commercial apiculture.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the mineral {{contents}} of various edible mushrooms found that C.micaceus contained the highest concentration of potassium in the 34species tested, close to half a gram of potassium per kilogram of mushroom. Because the species can bioaccumulate <b>detrimental</b> heavy metals like lead and cadmium, it has been advised to restrict consumption of specimens collected from roadsides or other collection sites that may be exposed to or contain pollutants.|$|E
5|$|At a {{fundamental}} level, energy flow and biogeochemical cycling set an upper {{limit on the}} number and mass of organisms in any ecosystem. Human impacts on the Earth are demonstrated {{in a general way}} through <b>detrimental</b> changes in the global biogeochemical cycles of chemicals that are critical to life, most notably those of water, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the late}} 1960s, fires were {{generally}} {{believed to be}} <b>detrimental</b> for parks and forests, and management policies were aimed at suppressing fires as quickly as possible. However, as the beneficial ecological role of fire became better understood in the decades before 1988, a policy was adopted of allowing natural fires to burn under controlled conditions, which proved highly successful in reducing the area lost annually to wildfires.|$|E
5|$|But {{not all the}} SNPs have a <b>detrimental</b> {{effect on}} TG levels. A recent report, showed that, in Sardinian population, the {{missense}} mutation Arg282Ser in APOA5 gene, correlates with a decrease in TG levels. The authors believe that this point mutation is a mayor modulatory of TG values in this population.|$|E
5|$|Early {{research}} {{showed that}} adding seductive details {{did not have}} the intended effect of improving learning; instead the seductive details tended to be <b>detrimental</b> to the learner's recall. Adding interesting but unimportant sentences to expository texts hindered the learning of the main points of the text and learners would remember the seductive details better than the main text.|$|E
5|$|Helminths {{known to}} infest weasels include the {{trematode}} Alaria, the nematodes Capillaria, Filaroides and Trichinella and the cestode Taenia. Least weasels are commonly {{infected with the}} nematode Skrjabingylus nasicola, adults of which {{are found in the}} nasal sinuses and can damage the skull. There is no evidence that this has serious <b>detrimental</b> effects on even heavily infested animals.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Adelman {{was honored}} as {{the keynote speaker}} at the First Annual Howard Adelman Lecture in celebration of the Centre for Refugee Studies’ 20th anniversary. Held during Refugee Rights Week in Toronto, Adelman {{reviewed}} recent research on refugees, suggesting it is probably more beneficial than <b>detrimental</b> to assist refugees.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, it was {{proposed}} that the annual Apple Cup between the Seattle-based Huskies and the Pullman-based Cougars be hosted at CenturyLink Field for sixyears beginning in 2010. The two programs could not reach an agreement on how to divide tickets. Pullman's business community had expressed concerns that playing the game away from the area would be <b>detrimental</b> to the local economy.|$|E
5|$|Intensity of {{precipitation}} is primarily measured for meteorological concerns. However, {{it can be}} of concern to aviation as heavy precipitation can limit visibility. Also, intensity of freezing rain can determine how hazardous it is for pilots to fly nearby certain locations since {{it can be an}} in-flight hazard by depositing ice on the wings of aircraft, which can be <b>detrimental</b> to flight.|$|E
5|$|Several {{animal species}} have been {{introduced}} to Everglades waterways. Many tropical fish are released, the most <b>detrimental</b> being the blue tilapia (Oreochromis aureus), which builds large nests in shallow waters. Tilapia also consume vegetation which would normally be used by young native fishes for cover and protection.|$|E
5|$|The ISA also {{empowers}} {{the authorities}} to prohibit political and quasi-military organizations, ban subversive documents and publications, shut down entertainments and exhibitions that are or {{are likely to be}} <b>detrimental</b> to the national interest, and to suppress organized violence by declaring parts of Singapore to be security areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{immune system}} is {{affected}} by sleep and rest, and sleep deprivation is <b>detrimental</b> to immune function. Complex feedback loops involving cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α produced in response to infection, appear to {{also play a role}} in the regulation of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Thus the immune response to infection may result in changes to the sleep cycle, including an increase in slow-wave sleep relative to REM sleep.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the regiment's time, when not on expeditions, was spent in fatigue duty building fortifications around Suffolk. This included digging trenches and clearing trees {{in front of the}} defensive lines. The hard labor had a <b>detrimental</b> effect on the general morale of the Union troops stationed at Suffolk. This was exacerbated by antagonistic feelings between the civilians of occupied Suffolk and the enlisted men of the 6th Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The raids {{ended in}} mid-1944 on {{the orders of}} Major-General Robert Laycock, the chief of Combined Operations Headquarters. He {{suggested}} that {{they were no longer}} as effective and only resulted in the Germans strengthening their beach defences, which could be <b>detrimental</b> to Allied plans.|$|E
5|$|The western {{portion of}} SR78 in North County is {{currently}} slated for several improvements. There were plans {{to construct an}} additional interchange at Rancho Del Oro Road in Oceanside; however, the Oceanside City Council decided to cancel these plans in 2005, despite studies suggesting that this move would be <b>detrimental</b> to the traffic in the region. The City Council reinstated those plans in September2012.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} {{significant}} parliamentary representation for the burgher class, and none for the peasants. The Jewish communities sent representatives {{to their own}} Va'ad, or Council of Four Lands. The narrow social base of the Commonwealth's parliamentary system was <b>detrimental</b> to its future development {{and the future of}} the Polish–Lithuanian statehood.|$|E
5|$|These {{birds are}} listed {{international}}ly under Appendix II of CITES, which allows {{international trade in}} live wild-caught and captive-bred specimens, if such exports are not <b>detrimental</b> to wild populations. However, the current Australian restrictions on commercial exports from Australia are not imposed by CITES. C. b. graptogyne is also specifically listed as endangered on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.|$|E
5|$|Using {{the rhetoric}} of the sublime, Wollstonecraft explores the {{relationship}} between self and society in the text. She values subjective experience, particularly in relation to nature; champions the liberation and education of women; and illustrates the <b>detrimental</b> effects of commerce on society.|$|E
5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most <b>detrimental</b> to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, {{to ensure}} that an {{entertainment}} or exhibition is not <b>detrimental</b> to the public interest, the Minister can impose conditions relating to the holding of the event on its promoter, every person involved in its promotion, and the proprietor of the premises on which the event is to be held. Failure to comply with any of such conditions is an offence, unless the person involved is able to show {{he or she was}} not responsible for the breach and exercised due care and caution. The authorities are empowered to close an entertainment or exhibition operated in breach of any condition, or kept open in contravention of an order by the Minister.|$|E
5|$|As Chief of the Air Staff at {{the onset}} of World WarII, Goble clashed with the Federal Government over {{implementation}} of the Empire Air Training Scheme, which he believed would be <b>detrimental</b> to the defence of Australia. He stepped down as leader of the RAAF in early 1940, and {{spent the rest of the}} war in Ottawa as Air Liaison Officer to Canada. Goble died in 1948 at the age of fifty-six, two years after retiring from the military.|$|E
5|$|Before its September 2011 release, Drive {{was shown}} {{at a number}} of film festivals, {{including}} the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, where it was praised and received a standing ovation. Refn won the festival's Best Director Award. The film received widespread praise, with critics highlighting Refn's direction, performances by the ensemble cast, visuals and action sequences, and the film score composed by Cliff Martinez. However, some critics were appalled by its graphic violence and found it potentially <b>detrimental</b> to the film's box office success. Several critics listed Drive {{as one of the best}} films of 2011; it received various accolades, including Best Sound Editing nomination at the 84th Academy Awards.|$|E
5|$|Birds of the {{nominate}} subspecies {{were introduced}} to New Zealand and Australia by acclimatisation societies between 1860 and 1880, apparently for purely sentimental reasons. In New Zealand, where it was introduced on both the main islands, the song thrush quickly established itself and spread to surrounding islands such as the Kermadecs, Chatham and Auckland Islands. Although it is common and widespread in New Zealand, in Australia only a small population survives around Melbourne. In New Zealand, {{there appears to be}} a limited <b>detrimental</b> effect on some invertebrates due to predation by introduced bird species, and the song thrush also damages commercial fruit crops in that country. As an introduced species it has no legal protection in New Zealand, and can be killed at any time.|$|E
5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly <b>detrimental.</b>|$|E
5|$|British {{architect}} Frederick Gibberd {{published a}} diagrammatic comparison of Durham Cathedral alongside a power station {{typical of the}} design of the time, like the one planned at Kepier. This made clear that, although the Cathedral was {{one of the largest in}} the country, it still would looked small next to the projected power station. It was argued that as long as the two structures were viewed simultaneously, the visual juxtaposition would be <b>detrimental</b> to the Cathedral. Somewhat ironically, Gibberd's Didcot Power Station would later be voted the third worst eyesore in Britain in 2003.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, {{the canal}} running through Rosendale had closed. On July5, 1911, the Jacob Rutsen house {{was hit by}} {{lightning}} and destroyed in a severe storm. The increased industrial use of Portland cement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was <b>detrimental</b> to Rosendale's economy, and the village lost almost 70percent of its population between 1900 and 1920; only one cement factory remained open after 1920. In April 1923, the Rosendale railroad depot and its freight house were destroyed in a fire.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{desire to}} resolve {{conflicts}} between circuit courts, legal scholars disagree about whether circuit splits are <b>detrimental</b> or beneficial. Some argue that circuit splits are harmful because they create confusion and encourage forum shopping, while other {{scholars argue that}} variation among circuits allows local courts to experiment with new laws that reflect the values of local residents. Scholars have also observed that regional variations in {{different areas of the}} United States have provided certain circuits with a particular specialization or expertise in some subjects of the law.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{also found}} {{evidence}} that Mandela had been {{an active member of}} the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s, something that was confirmed after his death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee. His membership had been hidden by the ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been <b>detrimental</b> to his attempts to attract support from Western countries. Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist-Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.|$|E
5|$|Exposure {{to light}} is <b>detrimental</b> to the {{stability}} of aqueous solutions of psilocybin, and will cause it to rapidly oxidize—an important consideration when using it as an analytical standard. Osamu Shirota and colleagues reported a method for the large-scale synthesis of psilocybin without chromatographic purification in 2003. Starting with 4-hydroxyindole, they generated psilocybin from psilocin in 85% yield, a marked improvement over yields reported from previous syntheses. Purified psilocybin is a white, needle-like crystalline powder with a melting point between , and a slightly ammonia-like taste.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2 {{has many}} helpful {{features}} available. The player can target enemies attacking a protected objective or match speeds with them. Power can be shunted between shields, engines, and weapons, thereby allowing faster recharge of shields, afterburners, and weapons {{at the expense}} of other subsystems. These features can be ignored without any <b>detrimental</b> effects on gameplay. The mission parameters are not rigidly fixed, as there is an allowance for the failures of some primary objectives. When the mission is concluded, a post-mission briefing will be conducted to discuss the mission, and the performance of the player, before the next mission can be taken on.|$|E
5|$|Godley was {{a colonel}} and {{serving on the}} staff of 2nd Division when, in 1910, he {{accepted}} the position of Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces, as the New Zealand Army was then known. He had some reservations about his new appointment; he had been in line for command of an infantry brigade and was concerned that being posted to remote New Zealand would be <b>detrimental</b> to his career. He arrived in New Zealand to take up his duties in December 1910.|$|E
