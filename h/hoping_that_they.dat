5|$|As The World Ends with You {{focuses on}} the {{character}} of Neku Sakuraba, {{in order to create a}} believable story the developers put a lot of focus on his development, such as how he would feel, what thoughts lie behind his actions, how he interacted with other characters, and how the people around him feel about him. The developers included aspects and daily concerns, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could be things that players would have to deal with their personal lives and therefore would let them relate with Neku.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1988 {{publication}} of Roddy Doyle's novel The Commitments (1987) in the United Kingdom, producers Lynda Myles and Roger Randall-Cutler acquired the film rights, and asked Doyle {{to write a}} film adaptation. Doyle, an inexperienced screenwriter, spent one year drafting the script, accompanied by Myles and Randall-Cutler. Although a script was completed, Myles felt it needed improvement, and passed the book on to Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would suggest a more experienced writer. However, upon reading the novel, Clement and La Frenais agreed to help write the script themselves.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E

5|$|While the WHA {{opened the}} door, and players slowly joined the NHL, those behind the Iron Curtain were {{restricted}} from following suit. In 1980, Peter Stastny, his wife, {{and his brother}} Anton secretly fled Czechoslovakia {{with the aid of}} Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut. The Stastnys' defection made international headlines, and contributed to the first wave of Eastern Europeans' entrance into the NHL. <b>Hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would one day be permitted to play in the NHL, teams drafted Soviet players in the 1980s, 27 in all by the 1988 draft. However, defection was the only way such players could join the teams that drafted them. Michal Pivonka defected from Czechoslovakia in 1986, while Russian Alexander Mogilny defected following the 1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Anchorage, Alaska. Czech teenager Petr Nedved walked into a Calgary police station in January 1989 after playing in the Mac's AAA midget hockey tournament.|$|E
5|$|Theodotus' {{success was}} not to be completed, however as in early summer 830, a fleet from the Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba in al-Andalus, under Asbagh ibn Wakil, arrived in Sicily despite the {{political}} difference and rivalry between Abbasid Caliphate and the Umayyad Emirate of Cordoba, the latter sent military assistance for Aghlabids to conquer Sicily although the Aghlabids was clearly serving under Abbasid interest. Ibn Kathir recorded that 300 ships of Umayyad and Aghlabids joint forces were present. Theodotus did not confront them, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would depart after raiding, but the beleaguered garrison at Mineo managed to get into contact with the raiders and proposed joint action. The Andalusians agreed, provided that Asbagh was recognized as the overall commander, and together with fresh troops from Ifriqiya marched on Mineo. Unable to confront them, Theodotus retreated to Enna and the siege of Mineo was broken (July or August 830). The combined Ifriqiyan and Andalusian army then torched Mineo and laid siege to another town, possibly Calloniana (modern Barrafranca). However, once again a plague broke out in their camp, killing Asbagh and many others. The town fell later, in autumn, but the Arabs' numbers were so depleted that they had to abandon it and retreat west. Theodotus launched a pursuit and inflicted heavy casualties, so that most of the Andalusians departed the island. However, Theodotus too was killed at this time, possibly in one of these skirmishes.|$|E
5|$|While European-born {{players were}} a part of the NHL since its founding, it was still rare to see them in the NHL until 1980, {{although}} the WHA employed a number of them. Borje Salming was the first European star in the NHL and Finns Jari Kurri and Esa Tikkanen helped lead the Oilers dynasty of the 1980s. The WHA opened the door, and players slowly joined the NHL, but those behind the Iron Curtain were restricted from following suit. In 1980, Peter Stastny, his wife, and his brother Anton secretly fled Czechoslovakia with the aid of Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut. The Stastnys' defection made international headlines, and contributed to the first wave of Europeans' entrance into the NHL. <b>Hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would one day be permitted to play in the NHL, teams drafted Soviet players in the 1980s, 27 in all by the 1988 draft; however, defection was the only way such players could play in the NHL. Shortly {{before the end of the}} 1988–89 regular season, Flames general manager Cliff Fletcher announced that he had reached an agreement with Soviet authorities that allowed Sergei Pryakhin to play in North America. It was the first time a member of the Soviet national team was permitted to leave the Soviet Union. Shortly after, Soviet players began to flood into the NHL. Teams anticipated that there would be an influx of Soviet players in the 1990s, as 18 Soviets were selected in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft.|$|E

25|$|As {{it turned}} out, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{was unwilling to}} fund two giant 10 GeV accelerators, but was willing to fund two smaller ones of 2.5 GeV and 6 GeV. At a meeting at which Brookhaven was {{represented}} by Morse, Livingston and Leland John Haworth, the Brookhaven team accepted the smaller one, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{would be able to}} get it finished first and thereby have an advantage in building the 10 GeV machine. The machine, known as the Cosmotron, was approved by the AEC in April 1948, and reached its full power of 3.3 GeV in 1953.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{traditional}} narrative, Catherine {{was the daughter of}} Constus, the governor of Egyptian Alexandria during the reign of the emperor Maximian (286–305). From a young age she devoted herself to study. A vision of the Madonna and Child persuaded her to become a Christian. When the persecutions began under Maxentius, she went to the emperor and rebuked him for his cruelty. The emperor summoned fifty of the best pagan philosophers and orators to dispute with her, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would refute her pro-Christian arguments, but Catherine won the debate. Several of her adversaries, conquered by her eloquence, declared themselves Christians and were at once put to death.|$|E
25|$|The conference {{had been}} planned as a meeting of representatives from the Maritime colonies: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. Newfoundland agreed with the movement, but was not {{notified}} in time {{to take part in}} the proceedings. Britain encouraged a Maritime Union between these colonies, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would then become less economically and politically dependent on the Crown, and provide for greater economic and military power for the region in light of the American Civil War. However, another colony, the Province of Canada, comprising present-day Ontario and Quebec, heard news of the planned conference and asked that the agenda be expanded to discuss a union that would also include them. In August 1864 Newfoundland also asked to be allowed to join the conference.|$|E
25|$|Jansson {{arrived in}} New York in June 1846 {{and with the}} help of 400 of his {{followers}} who had survived the journey, founded the Bishop Hill Colony in Henry County, Illinois. He named the colony after his Swedish birthplace. Although many died in the first winter, others continued to arrive from Sweden. The villagers lived as a collective religious colony for 15 years, from 1846 to 1861, tilling the soil, tending their animals, and building their settlement with bricks that they made by hand. Some local pioneers were amazed by their lifestyle and the relative success that it generated. Jansson sent nine of his followers to California in 1850, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would prospect successfully during the California Gold Rush. It was hoped that this additional wealth would help support their community.|$|E

25|$|Christie {{adapted the}} book as a play {{of the same name}} in 1945. It is notable for being one of the most radical reworkings of a novel Christie ever did, not only {{eliminating}} Hercule Poirot from the story, but also changing the identity of the killer. In the play, the ill Mrs Boynton committed suicide and dropped several red herrings that pointed to her family members as possible suspects, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would suspect each other and therefore continue to live in her shadow even after her death. In addition, the character of Carol Boynton has been dropped, Ginevra is now a stepdaughter (rather than a natural child) of Mrs Boynton, Lady Westholme becomes an ex-Member of Parliament, Miss Pierce is now Miss Pryce, and Alderman Higgs has been added as a fellow vacationer/verbal sparring partner for Lady Westholme.|$|E
25|$|In 376 AD, {{displaced}} by the invasions of the Huns, the Goths, led by Alavivus and Fritigern, asked {{to be allowed to}} settle in the Eastern Roman Empire. <b>Hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would become farmers and soldiers, the Eastern Roman emperor Valens allowed them to establish themselves in the Empire as allies (foederati). However, once across the Danube (and in Roman territory), the dishonesty of the provincial commanders Lupicinus and Maximus led the newcomers to revolt after suffering many hardships. Valens (of the Eastern Empire) then asked Gratian, the western emperor, for reinforcements to fight the Goths. Gratian sent the general Frigeridus with reinforcements, as well as the leader of his guards, Richomeres. For the next two years preceding the battle of Adrianople there were a series of running battles with no clear victories for either side.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, Cremonese luthiers {{were the}} {{suppliers}} and local {{players on the}} demand side. After Stradivari's death, this drastically changed. Although the Cremonese luthiers remained the suppliers, the demand side consisted of collectors, researchers, imitators, profiteers and speculators. Many local players {{could no longer afford}} the sought out instruments and most of the purchased instruments would be hidden in private collections, put in museums, or would be simply put back in their cases, <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would gain value over time. It is then that the so-called 'fever' for Stradivaris took off. Cozio, Tarisio and Vuillaume were the fathers of this frenzy that would extend well into the 21st century. Also, soon after Stradivari's death, most of the other major Cremonese luthiers would die, putting an end to the golden period of Cremona's violin making, which lasted more than 150 years, starting with the Amatis and ending with the Cerutis.|$|E
