5|$|Bhunivelze's {{physical}} form for Lightning Returns {{was designed by}} Toshitaka Matsuda. Matsuda made his design elaborate and detailed as a representation of both Nova Chrysalia and the <b>entire</b> <b>universe.</b> This design motif carried over to him being fused to the arena floor during the final battle. The character is voiced by Daniel Riordan in English and Yūki Kaji in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The ages of {{globular}} clusters place a bound {{on the age}} limit of the <b>entire</b> <b>universe.</b> This lower limit {{has been a significant}} constraint in cosmology. Historically, astronomers were faced with age estimates of {{globular clusters}} that appeared older than cosmological models would allow. However, better measurements of cosmological parameters through deep sky surveys and satellites such as the Hubble Space Telescope appear to have resolved this issue.|$|E
5|$|According to Procopius, the Slavs {{believed}} in one god, {{the creator of}} lightning and master of the <b>entire</b> <b>universe,</b> to whom all sacrificial animals (and sometimes people) were offered. The highest god was called Svarog throughout the Slavic area, but other gods were also worshiped in different regions at different times, often with local names. Natural objects such as rivers, groves or mountains were also celebrated, as well as nymphs, demons, ancestral and other spirits, who were all venerated and bought off with offering rituals, which also involved augury. Such beliefs and practices were later developed and individualized by the many Slavic tribes.|$|E
50|$|The {{simulated}} multiverse {{exists on}} complex computer systems that simulate <b>entire</b> <b>universes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Imperiex had {{the ability}} to create Black holes capable of sucking up <b>entire</b> <b>universes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Living Tribunal is {{the cosmic}} judge, overseer, and mediator. It {{safeguards}} the multiverse from dire threats, {{but is also}} willing to destroy <b>entire</b> <b>universes</b> on behalf of more favored creations.|$|R
5|$|The Universe is all {{of space}} and time (spacetime) and its contents, which {{includes}} planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space and all matter and energy. While the size of the <b>entire</b> <b>Universe</b> is still unknown, it is possible to measure the observable universe. Halpern and Tomasello calculated the observable universe using data from European Space Agency's Planck satellite, estimating it to be 90.68 billion light-years across, 0.7% smaller then previously thought.|$|E
5|$|After Keen finds Molly tied up at {{the back}} of the Bloog Control Center on the space station, she {{explains}} to him that she was kidnapped on the orders of her younger brother, who Keen knows to be his nemesis Mortimer McMire. Mortimer convinced the Bloogs to kidnap her by offering them the Stupendous Sandwich of Chungella IV. Keen is surprised, as he thought Mortimer was dead (he was apparently killed at the end of the Vorticon trilogy), and is dismayed to find out that Mortimer plans to blow up the <b>entire</b> <b>universe.</b> This conclusion is also revealed in an encoded note at the end of the Galaxy. The game ends by asking the player to play the next installment, where Keen would again fight Mortimer.|$|E
5|$|The saga of StarCraft is {{ultimately}} completed with , which {{was released on}} November 10, 2015. StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void is a stand-alone game in which new units are added to all three races as well as changing existing units, and also makes groundbreaking changes to the economy-aspect of the game. The story of Starcraft is concluded by following the Protoss Race {{in their quest to}} reclaim their homeworld and for Kerrigan to ultimately slay the greatest threat to the <b>entire</b> <b>universe.</b> The game is divided into a 3-mission prologue, a 19-mission main story campaign, and a 3-mission epilogue which wraps everything up.|$|E
25|$|It was widespread, {{encompassing}} the <b>entire</b> observable <b>universe.</b>|$|R
40|$|Branes now occupy {{center stage}} in {{theoretical}} physics as microscopic components of M-theory, as the higher-dimensional progenitors of black holes and as <b>entire</b> <b>universes</b> in their own right. Their history has been a checkered one, however. Here we list some of the milestones, starting with Dirac’s 1962 paper. Asim Barut was an early pioneer...|$|R
50|$|In October 2016, {{the movie}} {{rights to the}} <b>entire</b> Cosmere <b>universe</b> were {{licensed}} by DMG Entertainment.|$|R
5|$|In {{classical}} times, {{rather than}} making distant figures smaller with linear perspective, painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used reverse perspective for special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of optics in his Book of Optics in 1021, but never applied it to art. The Renaissance saw a rebirth of Classical Greek and Roman culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand nature and the arts. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed {{to figure out how}} to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of the physical world and that the <b>entire</b> <b>universe,</b> including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening scene}} is a three-minute computer-generated sequence, {{beginning}} {{with a view of}} Earth from high in the exosphere and listening in on numerous radio waves of modern programming emitting from the planet. The camera then starts zooming backward, passing the Moon, Mars, and other features of the solar system, then to the Oort cloud, interstellar space, the Local Bubble, the Milky Way, other galaxies of the Local Group, and eventually into deep space. As this occurs, the radio signals start to drop out and reflect older programming, representing the distance these signals would have traveled at the speed of light, eventually becoming silent as the distance becomes much greater. The sequence eventually resolves into the iris of young Ellie's eye as she is listening on her amateur radio set. This scale view shot of the <b>entire</b> <b>universe</b> was inspired by the short documentary film Powers of Ten (1977). At the time, it was the longest continuous computer-generated effect for a live-action film, eventually surpassed by the opening sequence from The Day After Tomorrow (2004).|$|E
5|$|Upon {{collecting}} enough Power Stars, the Comet Observatory regains {{the power}} to transform into a comet, and flies to {{the centre of the}} universe, where Bowser is holding Peach captive. Confronting Bowser, Mario learns that his plan is to rule the <b>entire</b> <b>universe</b> with Peach at his side, using a newly constructed sun of his own via the power of the Grand Stars. Mario manages to defeat Bowser and free Peach, but Bowser's sun collapses into itself, becoming a supermassive black hole that begins consuming everything nearby. All of Rosalina's Lumas jump into the black hole to destroy it, but sacrifice themselves in the process. The black hole collapses into a singularity and explodes in a supernova. Rosalina appears to Mario as a giantess, revealing that dying stars are later reborn as new stars. Mario awakens in the restored Mushroom Kingdom, full with all of the creatures he had met in the galaxies, alongside Peach and Bowser, celebrating the new galaxy that has emerged in the skies.|$|E

50|$|Not every {{alternate}} {{reality is}} an <b>entire</b> independent <b>universe,</b> but instead maintain a parasitic relationship {{to a parent}} reality. Others can exist outside the multiversal structure altogether.|$|R
25|$|Thanos {{decides to}} atone for the {{destruction}} of Rigel-3, and agrees to aid a colony of Rigellians in evacuating their planet before Galactus can consume it. During the course of this mission Thanos learns Galactus is collecting the Infinity Gems in an effort to end his unyielding hunger. Thanos later learns Galactus is being manipulated into releasing a multiversal threat called Hunger, which feeds on <b>entire</b> <b>universes.</b> Despite opposition from Thanos, Galactus unwittingly frees the entity, and when its intentions are revealed, the pair team up and attempt to destroy it.|$|R
5|$|The Doctor and Clara {{attend the}} ceremony, where the Doctor {{explains}} {{that since the}} Rings were settled {{there has been a}} constant song sung to keep an angry god asleep. The people fear that the god, which they call Grandfather, will awaken and consume the <b>entire</b> <b>universe</b> if the song is ever interrupted. Merry begins singing, joined by a chorister at the pyramid. During the song, a mummy in a glass case at the pyramid begins to awaken. Merry panics, believing she got the song wrong. A beam of light from the pyramid envelops her, and she is pulled toward the pyramid and the mummy. The Doctor and Clara find Dor'een and rent the space bike using Clara's mother's ring as payment. They ride the bike to the pyramid where they find the mummy struggling to escape the case and consume Merry's soul. The Doctor promises Merry that she does not have to sacrifice herself and that he will stop Grandfather. As they attempt to leave, a group of creatures called the Vigil arrive and attempt to force Merry to sacrifice herself. The Doctor holds the Vigil at bay long enough to let Clara and Merry escape from the throne room, but then the case shatters and the mummy breaks free. A ray of light strikes the planet, revealing that Grandfather is Akhaten itself, a planet-sized parasitic creature.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea that}} the <b>entire</b> <b>universe</b> is a {{deterministic}} system has been articulated in both Eastern and non-Eastern religion, philosophy, and literature.|$|E
25|$|Le Sage's {{theory of}} {{gravitation}} (1784) also called LeSage gravity, proposed by Georges-Louis Le Sage, {{based on a}} fluid-based explanation where a light gas fills the <b>entire</b> <b>Universe.</b>|$|E
50|$|November 1980: First {{issue of}} DC Comics' The New Teen Titans whose success at revitalizing a {{previously}} underperforming property {{would lead to}} the idea of revamping the <b>entire</b> DC <b>Universe.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The seven {{limbs of}} Vaishvanara have also {{referred}} to in the first verse of the Mandukya Upanishad, which have been described to encompass the <b>entire</b> manifest <b>universe.</b> The nineteen “mouths” are ...|$|R
50|$|Merlyn {{created the}} Starlight Citadel, {{located on a}} {{different}} island than Avalon. From the Starlight Citadel he founded the Captain Britain Corps, a group of superhuman heroes who would patrol the countless Earths in the Omniverse. Merlyn became the Omniversal Guardian and was assisted in his task by the Omniversal Majestor/Majestrix. His task was to safeguard the Omniverse against any threats and the technology Merlyn provided was capable of destroying <b>entire</b> <b>universes</b> that were a threat. When Mad Jim Jaspers appeared, Merlyn faked his death {{and was replaced by}} Roma as Omniversal Guardian. Saturnyne became the Omniversal Majestrix.|$|R
25|$|Some non-causal {{explanations}} involve invoking panpsychism, {{the theory}} that a quality of mind is associated with all particles, and pervades the <b>entire</b> <b>universe,</b> in both animate and inanimate entities.|$|E
25|$|Its {{philosophy}} {{teaches that}} there is a transcendent God, or Absolute, in which we and the <b>entire</b> <b>universe</b> participate. It also subscribes to the idea that other beings, such as aeons, angels and elementals, exist within the universe.|$|E
25|$|The fourth item is {{the common}} eastern idea of Maya. Blavatsky states that the <b>entire</b> <b>universe</b> is called {{illusion}} because everything in it is temporary, i.e. has a beginning and an end, and is therefore unreal {{in comparison to the}} eternal changelessness of the One Principle.|$|E
50|$|Universalizing formal {{education}} {{has been one of}} the foundation's key objectives. It seeks to address the rights of the <b>entire</b> <b>universes</b> of children- both in school and out of school - in the 5-14 age group and its area of operation. It sees children who are deprived of education opportunities as intrinsically hazardous to their growth and well-being. The MV Foundation also ensures that every child attending school does so without any disruption until she reaches class 10 since there is no guarantee that the child does not get pushed out of school to join the labour force again.|$|R
50|$|In 1985 DC Comics {{introduced}} the storyline Crisis on Infinite Earths. By this story's end the <b>entire</b> DC <b>Universe</b> was erased and restarted {{with a clean}} slate. As such the pre-Crisis version of Nubia ceased to exist.|$|R
50|$|Schismatrix: {{the system}} that {{includes}} the <b>entire</b> Shaper/Mechanist <b>universe.</b> The term is first used when the advent of détente opens {{the possibility of the}} Shaper and Mechanist factions coexisting harmoniously; a splintered posthuman settlement of the Solar System.|$|R
25|$|In 1932, Stapledon {{followed}} Last and First Men {{with the}} far less acclaimed Last Men in London. Another Stapledon novel, Star Maker (1937), {{could also be}} considered a sequel to Last and First Men (mentioning briefly man's evolution on Neptune), but is even more ambitious in scope, being {{a history of the}} <b>entire</b> <b>universe.</b>|$|E
25|$|Raja–Vidya–Raja–Guhya yoga (Religion by the Kingly Knowledge and the Kingly Mystery {{contains}} 34 verses): Krishna {{explains how}} His eternal energy pervades, creates, preserves, and destroys the <b>entire</b> <b>universe.</b> According to theologian Christopher Southgate, verses of this {{chapter of the}} Gita are panentheistic, while German physicist and philosopher Max Bernhard Weinstein deems the work pandeistic.|$|E
25|$|But, {{beginning}} in the 1950s and on through the 1970s, Heppenstahl began teaching that there were bigger issues involved in the pre-advent judgment than just humans. Heppenstahl’s protégés, Hans LaRondelle, Raoul Dederen and Morris Venden, through the 70s and 80s, taught {{an understanding of the}} purpose of the pre-advent judgment that includes humans, Satan, the <b>entire</b> <b>universe,</b> and even God Himself.|$|E
2500|$|The {{universal}} set V. Because [...] is a stratified formula, {{the universal}} set V = {x | x=x} exists by Comprehension. An immediate consequence {{is that all}} sets have complements, and the <b>entire</b> set-theoretic <b>universe</b> under NF has a Boolean structure.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to possessing vast size (varying from about nine feet, {{to hundreds of}} meters tall), vastly superhuman strength, extraordinary durability (by {{the end of the}} Crisis series he was able to effortlessly withstand blows from Superman, and even surviving a blue star going supernova), the ability to project destructive bolts of energy, and greatly augmenting another beings' powers (as he did with Psycho-Pirate, whose powers were increased to levels too much for him to handle), the Anti-Monitor also possessed reality-warping abilities, which he displayed by removing Psycho-Pirate's face. The Anti-Monitor also commanded an army of Qwardians and shadow demons, and had access to highly advanced technology capable of shifting, merging, or destroying <b>entire</b> <b>universes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... vishva or viśva (Sanskrit:विश्व), root विश् ("vish") (to pervade) means - all, whole, entire, universal, every, everyone, all-pervading, omnipresent.
