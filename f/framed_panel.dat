'One day Cyril {{left town}} {{to stay with}} his grandfather, I thought at the time, but I {{afterwards}} heard from Lord Crediton {{that this was not}} the case; and about a fortnight afterwards I received a telegram from him, handed in at Warwick, asking me to be sure to come and dine with him that evening at eight o'clock. When I arrived, he said to me, [...] "The only apostle who did not deserve proof was St. Thomas, and St. Thomas was the only apostle who got it." [...] I asked him what he meant. He answered that he had not merely been able to establish the existence in the sixteenth century of a boy-actor of the name of Willie Hughes, but to prove by the most conclusive evidence that he was the Mr. W. H. of the Sonnets. He would not tell me anything more at the time; but after dinner he solemnly produced the picture I showed you, and {{told me that he had}} discovered it by the merest chance nailed to the side of an old chest that he had bought at a farmhouse in Warwickshire. The chest itself, which was a very fine example of Elizabethan work, he had, of course, brought with him, and in the centre of the front panel the initials W. H. were undoubtedly carved. It was this monogram that had attracted his attention, and he told me that it was not till he had had the chest in his possession for several days that he had thought of making any careful examination of the inside. One morning, however, he saw that one of the sides of the chest was much thicker than the other, and looking more closely, he discovered that a <b>framed</b> <b>panel</b> picture was clamped against it. On taking it out, he found it was the picture that is now lying on the sofa. It was very dirty, and covered with mould; but he managed to clean it, and, to his great joy, saw that he had fallen by mere chance on the one thing for which he had been looking. Here was an authentic portrait of Mr. W. H., with his hand resting on the dedicatory page of the Sonnets, and on the frame itself could be faintly seen the name of the young man written in black uncial letters on a faded gold ground, [...] "Master Will.

40|$|Background: Viral {{contamination}} of surfaces {{is thought to}} be important in transmission. Chemical disinfection can be an effective means of intervention, but {{little is known about the}} virucidal efficacy of hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) against enteric and respiratory viruses. Aim: To measure the virucidal efficacy of HPV against respiratory and enteric viruses on materials representing those found in institutions and homes. Methods: Poliovirus, human norovirus genogroup II. 4 (GII. 4), murine norovirus 1, rotavirus, adenovirus and influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus dried on to stainless steel, <b>framing</b> <b>panel</b> and gauze carriers were exposed to HPV 127 ppm for 1 h at room temperature in an isolator. Poliovirus was also exposed to HPV at different locations in a room. The virucidal effect was measured by comparing recoverable viral titres against unexposed controls. Polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the effect of HPV on viral genome reduction. Findings: HPV disinfection resulted in complete inactivation of all viruses tested, characterized by > 4 log(10) reduction in infectious particles for poliovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus and murine norovirus on stainless steel and <b>framing</b> <b>panel</b> carriers, and > 2 log(10) reduction for influenza A virus on stainless steel and <b>framing</b> <b>panel</b> carriers, and for all viruses on gauze carriers. Complete inactivation of poliovirus was demonstrated at several locations in the room. Reductions in viral genomes were minimal on <b>framing</b> <b>panel</b> and gauze carriers but significant on stainless steel carriers; human norovirus GII. 4 genome was most resistant to HPV treatment. Conclusion: HPV could be an effective virucidal against enteric and respiratory viruses contaminating in-house environments. (C) 2011 The Healthcare Infection Society...|$|R

50|$|The three-storey {{rectangular}} church {{consists of}} a single nave and narrow presbytery, flanked by lateral bodies, and a principal facade consisting of double rectangular bell towers. These spaces are deferentially scaled with tiled gable roofs, including one annex, while simple faceted spires have been erected on the bell towers (painted white). The walls are plastered and white-washed, with the main floor, corners, pilasters, friezes, cornices and frames in black stone. The church is oriented to the southeast, with its main facade finished in an ornamented pediment, that includes a central circular clock, and crowned by an iron Latin cross above a gabled plinth and parallel elliptical scrolls, with lateral pinnacles. Consisting of two registers, the church is divided by cornices and friezes: by three rectilinear lines, with frames surmounted by convex friezes, linear cornices and windows with sills. Surmounting the main door is a triangular pediment and a rectangular <b>framed</b> <b>panel</b> showing symbols representing the three cardinal virtues below a backrest and angular cornice. This tympanum of the central panel has the inscription SUPER THESAUROS ALCISFUIT 1 Par. C.XXVII 25. Within each <b>framed</b> <b>panel</b> are rectangular framed windows, with the two central superior windows surmounted by framed cartouches. On the left cartouche is the AVE monogram, with the inscription ORA PRO NOBIS, while the right cartouche, with a carved open book, has the inscription QUABRITO PRIMUM REGNUM DEI. Over the windows on the second register of each bell tower are the insciprtions 21-IX-1895 (on the left) and 4-VI-1911 (on the right).Sensibly recessed from the main facade, the three-story towers are separated by cornices and friezes, with the two inferior floors occupied by rectangular windows, and the third register occupied by the belfry, with Roman Arch and flanked by pilasters. The lateral facade of the bell towers have narrower arches, while the posterior facades include three narrower arches.

In order to get insight in thevery complex behavior of ice; the sea ice growth, mechanical prop-erties and failure mechanisms are presented. Further some previouswork on the topic is presented, with discussion, in addition to regula-tions on local ice loads and structure requirements. The execution ofthe experiment is described, and the method for processing the dataand based on this data using probabilistic design to design a midshippanel. For datasets where the interaction area is semi-continuous anew event denition is proposed, based on temporal events consistingof spatial events. The maximum event method developed by [Jordaanet al., 1993] is applied in sampling data from the new temporal events. Data is sampled for increasing area sizes corresponding to number ofconnected triggered censor cells. The data is adjusted for exposure inorder to have a standardized curve corresponding to the area in ques-tion. An exponential distribution is tted to {{the tail of the}} data, andpresented in a Weibull probability plot. The parameters of the distri-butions, x 0 and are functions of area. Assuming the area is acting ina line corresponding to the span of a longitudinally <b>framed</b> <b>panel,</b> andgiven a return period and a scenario, a design load is predicted. Basedon this load, scantlings of a panel is recommended which also complieswith Finnish-Swedish ice class rules. The integrity of the structure ischecked using Monte Carlo analysis.

40|$|Wood is {{the oldest}} {{building}} materials and still now it {{plays an important role}} in the construction sector. There are many general advantages in using timber for building purposes. First of all, it is an environmentally friendly, easily recyclable material; it has a low weight in relation to strength, which is advantageous for transport, handling and production; moreover wood has aesthetic qualities, which give great possibilities in architectural design. Lastly wooden structures have an excellent performance in case of earthquake if compared to traditional structures. In Europe the development of the timber-concrete composite structures (TCC) began during a shortage of steel for reinforcement in concrete in the beginning of XX century. TCC application was primarily a refurbishment technique for old historical buildings, during the last 50 years interest in TCC systems has increased, resulting in the construction also of new buildings. This paper presents the analysis of the structural and thermal behaviour of an timber-concrete prefabricated composite wall system, the Concrete Glulam <b>Framed</b> <b>Panel</b> (CGFP) which is a panel made of a concrete slab and a structural glulam frame. The research analyses the structural performance with quasi-static in-plane tests, focused on the in-plane strength and stiffness of individual panels, and the thermal behaviour of the system with steady state tests using an hot box apparatus. The results validate the efficacy of proposed system ensuring the resistance and the dissipative structural behaviour through the hierarchy response characterized by the wood frame, the braced reinforced concrete panel of the singular module and by the rocking effects of global system. On the other side hot-box measures demonstrated a high level of thermal resistance of the system reaching U-values around 0, 20 W m- 2 K- 1. Moreover experimental data permitted to calibrate a FEM model with which will be possible to study and analyse the panels in different conditions and configuration in both mechanical and thermal field...|$|E
