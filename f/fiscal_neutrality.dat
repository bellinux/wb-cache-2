Where many current calculations get it wrong is in the assumption that more stringent mitigation measures will necessarily raise the overall cost, especially when there is substantial unemployment and underuse of capacity as there is today." [...] He has expressed the view that tougher restrictions for greenhouse gas emissions may, if done properly, actually have a positive macroeconomic effect: [...] "There is some evidence that harder greenhouse-gas targets and regulation may actually increase benefits through improved innovation and distribution of low-carbon technologies, and increased revenues from taxes or permits. These revenues can be spent to further support new technology and to lower other indirect taxes, ensuring the <b>fiscal</b> <b>neutrality</b> of these measures." ...|$|E

The ideal goal of such a refund {{is the creation of}} positive incentives: People will be rewarded when they behave in the wanted way. If, for example they reduce the emission of greenhouse gases or environmentally dangerous pollutants and reduce their Ecological footprint, they get back an ecological bonus (German: Ökobonus), because with the consumption of non-taxed environmentally friendly products, they pay less eco-taxes than the Green-Cheque is per capita: The amount of the eco-bonus is independent from the energy consumption of the individual recipients. In the words of a publication of the European Environment Agency: “A Swiss study (INFRAS/ECOPLAN, 1998), which investigated the economic and social impacts of different energy tax schemes, showed that redistributing revenues {{in the form of a}} per capita bonus is the most progressive option for an Environmental-tax-reform and creates the most beneficial social effects, although it leads to slightly negative effects on economic development.”The repayment of steering taxes is often named fiscal subsidy.

40|$|In {{the theory}} of {{monetary}} and fiscal policy interaction, the assumption of Ricardian households isolates the determinants of fiscal policy instrument from the price stabilization policies {{carried out by the}} central bank. One of the main implications of the above mentioned Ricardian assumption is that the fiscal policy does not have any distortionary effect for the economy, i. e. it does not affect the behaviour of the households, supporting that way the <b>fiscal</b> policy’s <b>neutrality.</b> The argument for this view comes if one assumes that fiscal policy has a distortionary effect on the behaviour of the agents. We relax the above non distortionary assumption by assuming that the imposition of the taxes is consistent with a transaction cost of the tax system that underlies the state - tax payer interaction. In this way we develop a channel through which the stability of prices carried out by the independent central bank is, within optimality, also a function of the fiscal policy determinants (the transaction cost, the tax rates and the debt level). The analysis is carried out in a framework of a monetary union, with two different countries. Within this framework, the effectiveness of a numerical fiscal rule is also examined.

40|$|The {{existing}} theoretical {{literature on}} fiscal competition has {{to a large}} extent ignored the role of government debt as a determinant of taxes and productive public spending. We develop a simple model of fiscal competition with government borrowing. If a default on government debt is no option, initial debt levels play no role in <b>fiscal</b> competition. This <b>neutrality</b> result is overturned when a default is possible. A government that is constrained in its borrowing due to a possible default responds optimally by lowering spending on durable public infrastructure, which in turn induces more aggressive tax setting. A rise in exogenous firm mobility reinforces the link between legacy debt and fiscal competition. Our model may help explain the observation that highly indebted countries in Europe have decreased corporate tax rates over-proportionally. Our model may also be useful for evaluating decentralization reforms in which the power to tax firms is devolved to lower levels of governments which differ in their initial debt levels...|$|R

In Serrano the Supreme Court of California held that to the extent existing differences in spending among school districts are caused by differences in wealth, the present scheme for financing public schools in California violates federal and state equal protection guarantees. The court further held that although school finance mechanisms may differ along many dimensions, they must respect one proscription: the quality of public education, at least as measured by spending per pupil, may not be a function of wealth other than the wealth of the state as a whole. Redundancy may be helpful here. One restatement of the court 2 ̆ 7 s holding is that Serrano requires of the state a <b>fiscal</b> <b>neutrality</b> among those agencies it creates and empowers to make different choices regarding educational spending. Another paraphrase would be that, to the extent the state allows quantities of public education to be bought by local units (whether counties, school districts, schools, or families), unit wealth must not be allowed to affect the quantity purchased. Since, as things stand, local taxable wealth per pupil is a major determinant of public school spending in almost all states, Serrano is significant; insofar as <b>fiscal</b> <b>neutrality</b> is not an elementary or unambiguous concept, the meaning of Serrano remains obscure.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} {{that the government}} imposes taxes. That public entities are themselves also subject to taxes, is less well-known and less obvious. The question arises whether {{it is appropriate to}} tax public entities. The general research question therefore is: should governments and public bodies be subjected to tax in the light of <b>fiscal</b> <b>neutrality?</b> This PhD. consists of three parts. The first part embodies the theoretical and conceptual framework. First, the different layers of the tax neutrality principle are analysed (relationship between public and private sector, relationship between entities of the public sector, equality, non-discrimination,…). Then, the boundaries of the public sector are analysed (what are public bodies?, what are public tasks?,…). The second part of this PhD is a critical analysis of current tax laws with regard to the tax treatment of the public sector from an international and VAT perspective and from a national perspective. The PhD shows that this tax treatment conflicts in many ways with the <b>fiscal</b> <b>neutrality</b> principle as defined in the first part. The third part of the PhD endeavours to find answers to the general and complementary research questions from a comparative law perspective. Two EU Member States (the Netherlands and France) with close historical and economic ties to Belgium are studied. A third country is also studied: New Zealand. At least with regard to VAT, this country applies a fundamentally different approach to taxation of the public sector (tax on supply of goods and provision of services, whilst at the European level public bodies are non-taxable). If governments or public bodies enjoy a special tax regime, reduced rates or exemptions, the question of compatibility with European Union state aid rules arises. They are therefore discussed in detail. The last part of this PhD contains proposals for law and policy which are based on research into positive law. The PhD thesis aims to identify the elements of a transparent and coherent tax treatment of public authorities and public bodies that safeguards the tax neutrality principle. nrpages: 757 status: publishe...|$|E

Many European countries {{have a long}} tradition with environmental taxes but recent figures indicate that the share of green tax revenues in the EU- 15 GDP is slightly declining.

Yet, the taxes levied in the new recipient country may simply pay for the public goods and services provided.

40|$|The {{run up to}} {{the euro}} has been {{characterized}} by soft growth especially in the largest countries of the zone. This disappointing performance is often imputed to the insufficient extent of structural reforms in labour and product markets. The ECB conduct of monetary policy, and the Stability and Growth Pact, would {{on the other hand}} have no negative role in the growth performance of euro zone countries. The financial crisis while calling for a temporary softening of the constraints (notably on fiscal policy), would also confirm that monetary policy was more virtuous in the euro zone than in the United States.

These are not linked to the existence of the euro per se, that in fact has helped growth by minimizing monetary perturbations, but rather to the political compromise that led to the current institutions for the economic government of Europe. This compromise imposed rules for monetary and <b>fiscal</b> <b>neutrality</b> while pushing for structural reforms whose main objective was to impose a new norm on the distribution of wealth.
