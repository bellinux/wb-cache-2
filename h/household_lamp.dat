60|$|Gentlemen,--If you {{had given}} this splendid {{entertainment}} {{to anyone else}} in the whole wide world--if I were to-night to exult in the triumph of my dearest friend--if I stood here upon my defence, to repel any unjust attack--to appeal as a stranger to your generosity and kindness as the freest people on the earth--I could, putting some restraint upon myself, stand among you as self-possessed and unmoved as I should be alone in my own room in England. But when I have the echoes of your cordial greeting ringing in my ears; when I see your kind faces beaming a welcome so warm and earnest as never man had--I feel, it is my nature, so vanquished and subdued, that I have hardly fortitude enough to thank you. If your President, instead of pouring forth that delightful mixture of humour and pathos which you have just heard, had been but a caustic, ill- natured man--if he had only been a dull one--if I could only have doubted or distrusted him or you, I should have had my wits at my fingers' ends, and, using them, could have held you at arm's- length. But you have given me no such opportunity; you take advantage of me in the tenderest point; you give me no chance of playing at company, or holding you at a distance, but flock about me like a host of brothers, and make this place like home. Indeed, gentlemen, indeed, if it be natural and allowable for each of us, on his own hearth, to express his thoughts in the most homely fashion, and to appear in his plainest garb, I have a fair claim upon you to let me do so to-night, for you have made my home an Aladdin's Palace. You fold so tenderly within your breasts that common <b>household</b> <b>lamp</b> in which my feeble fire is all enshrined, and at which my flickering torch is lighted up, that straight my household gods take wing, and are transported there. And whereas it is written of that fairy structure that it never moved without two shocks--one when it rose, and one when it settled down--I can say of mine that, however sharp a tug it took to pluck it from its native ground, it struck at once an easy, and a deep and lasting root into this soil; and loved it as its own. I can say more of it, and say with truth, that long before it moved, or had a chance of moving, its master--perhaps from some secret sympathy between its timbers, and a certain stately tree that has its being hereabout, and spreads its broad branches far and wide--dreamed by day and night, for years, of setting foot upon this shore, and breathing this pure air. And, trust me, gentlemen, that, if I had wandered here, unknowing and unknown, I would--if I know my own heart--have come with all my sympathies clustering as richly about this land and people--with all my sense of justice as keenly alive to their high claims on every man who loves God's image--with all my energies as fully bent on judging for myself, and speaking out, and telling in my sphere the truth, as I do now, when you rain down your welcomes on my head.|$|E

40|$|UV {{radiation}} is utilized {{in a number}} of environmental technologies, most notably for the disinfection of water, air, and surfaces through the use of UVC fluorescent lamps. Recently, our group developed a luminescent material that could emit germicidal UVC simply by irradiating it with a <b>household</b> fluorescent <b>lamp,</b> thus introducing a new type of antimicrobial surface powered by low-intensity visible light. The materials were doped with praseodymium ions (Pr 3 +) which have the unique capability of converting visible light to higher energy UV using an optical mechanism called upconversion.

Herein we discuss the pursuit of new material forms and modifications designed to improve the efficiency of Pr 3 +-based upconversion systems. These enabled successful enhancement of antimicrobial activity and led to a proof of concept for upconversion-sensitized TiO 2 photocatalysis.

Through the photoluminescence process of upconversion, low energy photons can be amplified into higher energy photons, and in this case, phosphors capable of converting visible light into germicidal UVC radiation were synthesized. Host crystals were doped with a praseodymium activator ion and shown to emit UVC photons upon excitation by blue or violet light. Surface coatings were prepared and proof-of-concept experiments demonstrated that, under exposure to a <b>household</b> fluorescent <b>lamp,</b> sufficient UVC radiation was emitted from the surfaces to achieve observable inactivation of surface bacterial spores and inhibition of biofilm growth. Material engineering was conducted to achieve higher optical conversion efficiency, wherein lithium codoping and development of alternative oxyfluoride host crystals were found to significantly improve upconversion emission.

The effects of the fundamental parameters that govern the kinetics of the photocatalytic decolourization of MB, such as the mass of TiO 2 coated onto the glass plate, the pH and the TiO 2 surface morphology, were also studied. The kinetics of the MB decolourization in all cases {{was found to be}} pseudo-first-order kinetics and was fitted to the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model. The degraded part of the ENR binder led to generating pores within the surface of the TiO 2 /ENR film and converting it into porous form, as confirmed by SEM analysis. Furthermore, TGA, FTIR and leachability analyses were conducted to further confirm the depletion of the ENR from the TiO 2 /ENR film. The kinetics of the MB decolourization and the efficiency of the MB colour removal indicated that the porous TiO 2 /ENR film becomes approximately twice as fast as the non-porous TiO 2 /ENR film...|$|R
