40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{numerous}} studies have estimated the economic impacts {{of a variety of}} disruptions. Most of these studies are based on macroeconomic models that quantify the direct and indirect <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> from a disruption. Direct <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> occur due to damaged facilities or when consumers change their purchasing behavior because of the disruption.

We compare the direct and indirect <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> from a variety of disruptions, including earthquakes, hurricanes, terrorist attacks, pandemic diseases, and port closures.

40|$|The <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> bars {{recovery}} by a {{party who}} suffers only economic loss, unaccompanied by {{harm to the}} person or property. Although the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> was developed {{as a way to}} maintain a “boundary line” between contract and tort law, the application of the rule has proven difficult because of its potential for broad applicability and inequitable results. Because of this, several jurisdictions across the United States have adopted exceptions to the general <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule.</b> One such exception is negligent misrepresentation. The negligent misrepresentation exception is outlined in section 552 of the Second Restatement of Torts. The exception provides that a person who conveys negligent information {{in the course of his}} or her business for the guidance of persons within a limited class, who then rely on that information to their detriment, are liable to those persons in tort notwithstanding the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule.</b> Until recently, Texas law was unclear as to whether it had adopted negligent misrepresentation as a general exception to the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule.</b> It is clear, however, that Texas has adopted an exception to the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> for professionals who provide negligent information in the course of their profession. The Court in LAN/STV v. Martin K. Eby Constr. Co. (“LAN/STV”) chose not to extend this exception to design professionals who provide negligent design plans to contractors for a construction project. This decision has received backlash by many in the construction industry as it produces inequitable results and does not extend the “professional” exception to design professionals.

40|$|Though its seeds {{may have}} been planted long before, the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> in {{products}} liability tort law emerged in full force {{at the very same}} moment as the doctrine of strict products liability in the mid- 1960 s. This moment, fueled by the fall of privity and the rise of implied warranty earlier in the century, was of great doctrinal import — a moment when strict liability threatened to erase altogether the boundary between tort and contract in the context of defective products cases and move those cases firmly into the tort realm. The <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> emerged as a crucial new levee against a flood of potentially limitless tort liability. It forged a new dividing line, keeping cases involving pure financial losses within the domain of con-tract by denying recovery for such losses under any theory of tort. Seen in this light, the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> emerged to protect the “remains” of the citadel of privity. William Prosser, so intently focused on the dramatic siege on the citadel of privity, overlooked a few, highly significant cases, where courts continued to require privity in order for the plaintiff to recover for negligently inflicted economic losses by defective products. Over the two decades that followed Prosser’s The Fall of the Citadel, the debate over the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> in products cases continued to unfold, culminating in the U. S. Supreme Court’s embrace in East River Steamship. That case ensured the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> would keep contract from “drowning in a sea of tort” and that the wall between the “separate spheres” of tort and contract law could not be breached. After an exploration of the evolution of, and rationales for, the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> in products cases, this Article examines whether the citadel’s last bastion should be preserved. It con-cludes that the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> in products cases may be best justified as a means to induce the putative victims — here, the parties with superior information regarding risk of financial loss — to protect themselves...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> {{states that}} a {{plaintiff}} cannot recover damages for a pure financial loss. The {{comparative study of}} the pure <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> reveals that in different jurisdictions, the legal definitions of the rule frequently lump together diverse situations. The actual significance {{of the notion of}} “economic loss ” varies considerably across Western legal systems. Legal doctrines provide little insight as to why liability should, or should not, be denied. On the other hand, economic models of liability provide some valuable guidance for classifying different categories of economic loss, and identifying cases in which denial of recovery for economic loss would lead to inefficient outcomes. A law and economics analysis shows that a key factor in determining the optimal scope of the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> is in the relationship between pure economic loss and social loss. Economic loss should be compensable in torts {{only to the extent that}} it corresponds to socially relevant loss. After identifying several factual categories, this paper characterizes the optimal level of liability with reference to the relevant economic and social loss components and the resulting optimal incentives to reduce risk. In a few situations, the application of the optimal liability rule finds obstacles in entrenched principles of civil liability. Generally, however, the legal applications of the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> are consistent with the ideal liability rule identified by the economic model. As generally understood in the law and economics literature, the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> states that a plaintiff cannot recover damages for a pure financial loss. The comparative study of the pure <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> reveals that the recognition and significance attributed to such rule and to the notion...|$|E
40|$|Most litigants, {{if given}} the chance, prefer to assert tort {{theories}} to recover their economic losses, rather than rely on the remedies provided under contract law. This is primarily because plaintiffs {{have the potential to}} recover more damages under tort law than contract law. However, most courts have adopted a doctrine known as the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> to bar plaintiffs from asserting certain tort theories to recover for their economic loss. Although the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> may seem like an easy way to maintain the boundary between tort law and contract law, confusion abounds when courts attempt to determine the proper contexts in which to apply the doctrine. In 2013, the Florida Supreme Court resurrected issues of the doctrine’s proper scope when it rendered Tiara Condominium Ass’n v. Marsh 2 ̆ 6 McLennan Cos., which restricted application of the doctrine to products liability cases. Although the Florida Supreme Court has held that the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> applies only when a defective product causes pecuniary loss to the plaintiff, other jurisdictions adhere to a broader application of the doctrine. In these jurisdictions, the doctrine serves a fundamental purpose to protect the boundary line between tort law and contract law by preventing parties who are in contractual privity from circumventing the bargain that they made in their contract. This Note argues that the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> is not just for products liability, but should be applied to serve such a fundamental purpose, specifically where sophisticated parties engage in arms-length transactions, bargaining for the allocation of risk and economic loss in their contract...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> precludes plaintiffs-such {{as those}} {{affected by the}} BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill-from recovering losses not resulting from damage to person or property. Most states have applied the rule to various circumstances and have carved out several exceptions over time, including one for commercial fishermen. In the Florida Supreme Court’s decision in Curd v. Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC, the court expanded the duty element in negligence to new reaches for claims of pure economic loss. As a result, Florida now unquestionably promises the greatest opportunity {{compared to the other}} Gulf states for recovery of pure economic losses due to the negligence of a polluter such as Mosaic Fertilizer or BP. The issue that remains unclear after Curd is whether and how far this newly stated duty will extend beyond commercial fishermen to parties such as distributors, restaurants, fisheries, and fish brokers.

40|$|Although {{the pure}} <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> has been remarkably durable {{in the common}} law, it suffers from a {{theoretical}} deficit. The rule has not been properly framed within the broader context of Anglo-American political economy. Any theory must recognize that the rule fundamentally deals with business risk and economic organization. Two conceptions of risk are important: risk to economic assets essential to the production function (loss of a factor of production), and risk to outcomes (loss of production). This Article proposes a production theory of the pure <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule,</b> which {{is rooted in the}} neoclassical economic understanding of the relationship between uncertainty and profit. The theory is simply stated: tort law protects one 2 ̆ 7 s factors of production, but not outcomes. The emphasis on the loss of an economic asset departs from the requirement of loss of one 2 ̆ 7 s property, the traditional basis for recovery of consequential economic loss. Ownership is not and should not be the touchstone of recovery. Rather, society has a normative preference for economic production, and tort law protects an asset essential to the production function, irrespective of ownership. The pure <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> is a market abstention doctrine. It reflects a bright line judicial policy against corrective legal action when economic loss represents not a market failure in precaution but instead is a necessary condition of the engagement of enterprise under Knightian uncertainty. Thus, the production theory resolves a classic, longstanding riddle of the common law - that is, why consequential economic loss is recoverable upon the loss of an asset, but pure economic loss is not upon a poor economic outcome...|$|E

In Casa Clara the Florida Supreme Court {{held that a}} building is {{to be treated as}} a “product” for purposes of applying the Economic Loss Rule’s bar to tort claims for defective building materials incorporated into the building. Although Casa Clara adopted the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> established by Seely v. White Motor Co. and East River Steamship Corp. v.

Moreover, in Saratoga Fishing Co. v. J. M. Martinac 2 ̆ 6 Co. the United States Supreme Court rejected the “object of the bargain” analysis that served as the sole basis for the Florida Supreme Court’s characterization of real property as the “the product itself. ” The Saratoga Court recognized that the focus should be on the product that was “placed in the stream of commerce” instead. Thus, when the Florida Supreme Court returned the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> to its original interpretation under Seely and East River in Tiara, it receded from Casa Clara’s holding that a building must be treated as a “product” for the purposes of applying the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule...</b>|$|E

40|$|Tort {{litigation}} over data breaches—defined here as {{the theft}} of one’s confidential information entrusted to another in a business transaction—most commonly involves the negligence cause of action. These claims turn {{on a number of}} issues that require searching analysis, including the manner in which the <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> affects the tort duty, the relation between the negligence standard of care and strict liability, and the appropriate forms of compensable loss. Substantive analysis of these issues shows that they all can be resolved in favor of the negligence claim, which in turn justifies a rule of strict liability. The <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> <b>rule</b> does not provide a substantive rationale for barring tort claims because customers do not have the information necessary to adequately protect their interests by contracting. Moreover, the common-law tort duty can be independently justified by the legislative policy decisions embodied in statutes that regulate data breaches. To prove a breach of the duty to exercise reasonable care, the victims of identity theft will often face considerable evidentiary difficulties stemming either from the complexity of data-security systems or the unreliability of other relevant evidence involving the conduct of defendant’s employees. For reasons recognized by tort law in analogous contexts, the evidentiary difficulties of proving negligence can justify a rule of strict liability for enforcing the tort duty to exercise reasonable care. Finally, the important forms of damages caused by identity theft—the cost of credit-monitoring services and the like, unauthorized charges, and any significant loss of time and emotional distress—are all compensable as a matter of basic tort principles. Strict tort liability in these cases ultimately finds justification in the important public policy of maintaining the integrity of market transactions...|$|E

The total <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> of mastitis (subclinical and clinical) per cow present in a default situation varied between ¿ 65 and ¿ 182 /cow per year depending on the bulk tank somatic cell count. The tool {{was used to measure}} perception of the total <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> of mastitis on the farm and the farmers' assessment of the cost factors of mastitis on 78 dairy farms, of which 64 were used for further analyses. Most farmers (72 %) expected their <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> to be lower than those revealed by our calculation made with their farm information. Underestimating the <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> of mastitis can be regarded as a general problem in the dairy sector. The average <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> assessed by the farmers were ¿ 78 /cow per year, but a large variation was given, ¿ 17 ¿ 198 /cow per year. Although the average assessment of the farmers of the different cost factors is close to the default value, there is much variation. To improve the adoption rate of advice and lower the incidence of mastitis, it is important to show the farmers the <b>economic</b> <b>losses</b> of mastitis on their farm. The tool described in this paper can play a role in that process...|$|R

The section titled ‘‘Early development of <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> models’’ provides a description {{on the early}} development of <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> models and how research methods have evolved {{over the last four}} decades. The section titled ‘‘The estimation of economic loss’’ will give some practical examples for estimating <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> and the different approaches {{that can be used to}} compare counterfactual scenarios. The section titled ‘‘Infrastructure and the economy as a complex interconnected system’’ will introduce critical infrastructure as a complex interconnected system and why special models are required to estimate the impacts of infrastructure failure. The section titled ‘‘Empirical approaches to modelling economic loss’’ will compare and contrast the four most widely used methods for estimating <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> from infrastructure failure. The section titled ‘‘Strengths and weaknesses of different Input-Output Models’’ introduces and then discusses the strengths and weaknesses of several I-O based methods and the section titled ‘‘How to improve <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> estimation from infrastructure failure’’ provides some recommendations for how modelling <b>economic</b> <b>loss</b> from infrastructure needs to be improved to overcome these limitations.|$|R
