40|$|International audienceThe flow {{behaviour}} of a SBR compound during single screw extrusion {{process has been}} investigated. Experiments were conducted on a single screw extruder equipped with various pressure and temperature sensors along the screw profile. Influences of temperature of feed section, screw and barrel were characterised. In order to modify the pressure drop, different dies were used. Three parameters were varied during the tests: the screw rotation speed (15, 40 and 70 min- 1), {{the temperature of the}} feed section and barrel (30, 60 and 90 °C) and that of the screw (50 and 90 °C), and fi nally the <b>die</b> <b>restriction.</b> The characteristic curves of the extruder were deduced from the values of head pressure and flow rate. A comparison of the characteristic curves was made to determine which factor (temperature of the feed section, of the barrel or of the screw) was the most signifi cant. An increase in the temperature of feed section induced a decrease of flow rate and pressure. An opposite effect was observed when increasing the screw temperature. Finally, in order to predict the behaviour of this material during the extrusion process, a numerical simulation has been implemented. The 1 D model developed may provide orders of magnitude, but is too simplified to account for the complex conditions prevailing in the process...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{recent years}} {{asymmetric}} cross section aluminum alloy stock has been finding increasing use in various industrial manufacturing {{areas such as}} general structures and automotive components. In these areas, components are generally required to have complex curved configuration and, as such, a bending process is required during manufacture. Undesirable deformation in bending processes such as flattening or wrinkling can easily occur when thin-walled sections are bent. Hence, {{a thorough understanding of}} the bending behavior of such sections is needed to prevent these undesirable deformations. In this study, the bending behavior of asymmetric channel section was examined using finite element analysis (FEA). Typical methods of preventing undesirable deformation, such as asymmetric laminated elastic mandrels were included in FEA model of draw bending. Additionally, axial tension was applied to prevent wrinkling. By utilizing the FE simulations effect of <b>restriction</b> <b>dies</b> and axial tension on undesirable deformation during the process was clarified. Keywords—bending, draw bending, asymmetric channel section, <b>restriction</b> <b>dies,</b> axial tension, FEA E I...|$|R

The mathematical model {{of the process of}} pressure granulation (pelleting, extrusion agglomeration) of plant raw materials in the conditions of the closed wedge-shaped space between a die and each of press rollers is presented. On the ba-sis of the analysis of the mathematical model possi-bility of significant increase of capacity and decrease in energy intensity of pellet mills having additional contact surfaces in the form of restrictive rings is show...|$|R
40|$|Neuromuscular {{junction}} disorders {{affect the}} pre- or postsynaptic nerve to muscle transmission due to autoimmune antibodies. Members {{of the group}} like myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton syndrome have pathophysiologically distinct characteristics. However, in practice, distinction may be difficult. We present {{a series of three}} patients with a myasthenic syndrome, dropped-head syndrome, bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness and positive testing for anti-N-type voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies. In two cases anti-acetylcholin receptor antibodies were elevated, anti-P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies were negative. All patients initially responded to pyridostigmine with a non-response {{in the course of the}} disease. While one patient recovered well after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins, 3, 4 -diaminopyridine, steroids and later on immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil, a second <b>died</b> after <b>restriction</b> of treatment due to unfavorable cancer diagnosis, the third patient declined treatment. Although new antibodies causing neuromuscular disorders were discovered, clinical distinction has not yet been made. Our patients showed features of pre- and postsynaptic myasthenic syndrome as well as severe dropped-head syndrome and bulbar and axial muscle weakness, but only anti-N-type voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies were positive. When administered, one patient benefited from 3, 4 -diaminopyridine. We suggest that this overlap-syndrome should be considered especially in patients with assumed seronegative myasthenia gravis and lack of improvement under standard therapy...|$|R
40|$|Walnut and almond kernels {{are highly}} nutritious mainly {{due to their}} high oil contents. In this study, 32 {{factorial}} experimental designs were used to optimize processes for oil extraction by screw-pressing at industrial scale. Experimental designs included seed moisture content (SMC), and <b>restriction</b> <b>die</b> (RD) as the main processing parameters. Theoretical models were scanned against experimental data in order to optimize oil extraction conditions. The response variables analyzed were oil yield (OY), fine solid content (FC) in oil, and oil quality parameters. Fitted models for OY indicated maximum predicted values similar to the highest experimental values. Walnut oil extractions showed a maximum OY (84. 5 ± 2. 3 %) at 7. 21 % SMC, and 10 mm RD. For almond kernels, maximum OY (71. 9 ± 3. 5 %) was obtained at 9. 42 % SMC, and 12 mm RD. Chemical quality parameters from both oils were in the ranges stated in Codex (FAO/WHO) standards for virgin (non-refined) oils...|$|R
5000|$|In 1978 the PAC leader Sobukwe <b>died</b> in <b>restriction</b> in Kimberley and Leballo {{was elected}} Chairman of the PAC. His {{position}} was tenuous. Nkrumah {{was long gone}} and Mao Zedong died in 1976. The PAC {{had been forced to}} consider extremely unsavory allies such as Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein and Idi Amin. The main threat however came from the US Carter administration that had resolved it needed South Africa as a stable element in the equation to settle the Zimbabwe issue. The ANC and PAC were urged to abandon guerrilla war and embrace détente and dialogue. Andrew Young, the (USA UN ambassador) and the Nigerians reportedly donated {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to David Sibeko, the PAC representative at the UN, to dilute Leballo's revolutionary ideology by getting his own supporters elected to the new PAC executive. Sibeko was largely successful (hence Leballo's title of [...] "Chairman" [...] rather than [...] "President") but neglected the newly recruited Azanian People's Army (APLA), already victorious over the older APLA of Templeton Ntantala and demanding a greater share in finances. In 1979 Leballo left for medical treatment in England and a triumvirate of Sibeko, Vusi Make, and Elias Ntloedibe announced they were the new PAC leadership following Leballo's [...] "resignation." [...] APLA commanders arrived in Dar es Salaam from Itumbi Camp, Chunya near Mbeya, and quarreled with Sibeko. The same evening they shot him dead. Vusi Make was then declared the new PAC leader but APLA rejected him. In the ensuing standoff at Chunya, Tanzanian troops coldbloodedly killed four unarmed APLA soldiers, wounded forty and split the survivors. Forty(40)of the APLA soldiers who were deemed dangerous by the PAC leadership were sent to a detention camp in Mgagau, Iringa. In 1980 Leballo arrived in Zimbabwe and established a new PAC headquarters. He had no funds and was financially supported by a white APLA intelligence officer. Although he was welcomed by Edgar Tekere, the ZANU (PF) Secretary General and other party and military leaders, others including Prime Minister Robert Mugabe, pointedly kept their distance. Leballo's intelligence officer advised him to bolster links with North Korea, whose ambassador was enthusiastic and had even financed household purchases for Leballo, because the officer felt that however Pan Africanist the party was, it simply couldn't trust African governments and it was advisable to find a secure base in North Korea. Leballo declined, saying the party had to rely on Africa, however treacherous politicians were. He was encouraged by the Libyan government's promise to finance an exiled University of Azania in Zimbabwe.|$|R
