60|$|Carl {{talked for}} two minutes about something, {{he did not know}} what, and took his leave. In the {{intensity}} of his effort to be resentfully dignified he stumbled over the hall <b>hat-rack.</b> He heard Gertie yelp with laughter.|$|E
60|$|Returning from Genie Linderbeck's room, Carl found {{a letter}} from Gertie Cowles on the black-walnut <b>hat-rack.</b> Without reading it, but {{successfully}} befooling himself into the belief that {{he was glad to}} have it, he went whistling up to his room.|$|E
60|$|Softly, {{without knowing}} that it was softly, he opened the door; softly, without knowing it was softly, he stepped to the <b>hat-rack</b> and took his black straw hat; softly, without knowing it was softly, he went out, and, unfaltering, hurried down the drive.|$|E
60|$|The {{ghost of}} Morton, dead and forgotten, {{was with him}} all next day, till he got home and unbelievably found on the staid black-walnut Zapp <b>hat-rack</b> a letter from Paris, in a gray foreign-appearing {{envelope}} with Istra's intensely black scrawl on it.|$|E
60|$|Stephen, {{close to}} his <b>hat-rack,</b> felt soreness in his heart. Such blows as Fortune had dealt, and meant to deal him, he had borne, and he could bear, {{so long as there}} was nothing in his own manner, or in that of others, to show him they were blows.|$|E

60|$|He was in {{the hall}} now,--a miserable, untidy place with a broken-down mirror and <b>hat-rack</b> as sole furniture, {{and covered with a}} much soiled oilcloth. The stairs were right ahead of him, and Deane looked up. He looked into a woman's face as she leaned over the well of the banisters, looking down. Almost {{immediately}} she drew away and came down.|$|E
60|$|The {{merchant}} {{closed the}} door, and Douglas Stone {{walked down the}} narrow passage, glancing about him in some surprise as he did so. There was no oil-cloth, no mat, no <b>hat-rack.</b> Deep grey dust and heavy festoons of cobwebs met his eyes everywhere. Following the old woman up the winding stair, his firm footfall echoed harshly through the silent house. There was no carpet.|$|E
60|$|The sacque {{still lay}} on the floor at his feet; he pulled his chair a little forward and put his feet on it. He feigned to write awhile longer, and then he folded up his papers, and went out, leaving Marcia to make her Sunday dinner alone. When he came home late at night, he found the sacque where she had dropped it, and with a curse he picked it up and hung it on the <b>hat-rack</b> in the hall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come with me, child," [...] she said, in pretended severity. [...] "Tom, {{you take}} my hand in the game, and don't let me hear you've been bidding ten on no suit without the joker." [...] She led Mr. Wrenn to the settee <b>hat-rack</b> in the hall. [...] "The third-floor-back will be vacant in two weeks, Mr. Wrenn. We can go up {{and look at it}} now if you'd like to. The man who has it now works nights--he's some kind of a head waiter at Rector's, or {{something}} like that, and he's out till three or four. Come." ...|$|E
60|$|She had a moment's panic {{about having}} left the agents' permits on the table, and after remembering {{that she had}} put them into her little shopping-bag, where she kept her money (each note crushed into a round wad), and had heft it on the <b>hat-rack,</b> where it would {{certainly}} be stolen, she found it on her wrist. She {{did not think that}} very funny; but after a first impulse to inculpate her husband, she let him laugh, while they stopped under a lamp and she held the permits half a yard away to read the numbers on them.|$|E
6000|$|The {{chief clerk}} {{glanced at the}} <b>hat-rack,</b> but, seeing the row complete, offered no remark. As {{soon as he was}} on the landing the man pulled a shepherd's plaid cap out of his pocket, put it on his head and ran quickly down the rickety stairs. From the street door he walked on furtively on the inner side of the path towards the corner and all at once dived into a doorway. He was now safe in the dark snug of O'Neill's shop, and filling up the little window that looked into the bar with his {{inflamed}} face, the colour of dark wine or dark meat, he called out: ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Halleck {{came to her}} rescue at her own door, and {{let them}} in. He shook hands with Bartley again, and viewed Marcia with a fatherly {{friendliness}} that took away half her awe of the ugly magnificence of the interior. But still she admired that Bartley could be so much at his ease. He pointed to a stick {{at the foot of}} the <b>hat-rack,</b> and said, [...] "How much that looks like Halleck!" [...] which made the old man laugh, and clap him on the shoulder, and cry: [...] "So it does! so it does! Recognized it, did you? Well, we shall soon have him with us again, now. Seems a long time to us since he went." ...|$|E
6000|$|The train {{rolled into}} the station. As it began to glide past the {{pavement}} of wet asphalt I closed my eyes to postpone the bitterness of disappointment, {{if only for a}} few seconds. Perforce I opened them again as the train was stopping, and there, the very first thing they fell upon, looking portly and imposing in a fur coat, was the rubicund-faced Head of the Firm himself. [...] "It is good," [...] I thought, and supported myself for a moment by the <b>hat-rack,</b> for the revulsion of feeling produced a sudden faintness. He saw me, and sprang forward with a beaming yet respectful countenance. [...] "It is very good," [...] I thought.|$|E
60|$|Possessed of his sovereigns, John Hay would fain {{have spent}} {{them one by}} one on such coarse amusements as his soul loved; but he was haunted by the instant fear of Death; for the ghost of his {{relative}} stood in the hall of his house close to the <b>hat-rack,</b> shouting up the stairway that life was short, that there was no hope of increase of days, and that the undertakers were already roughing out his nephew's coffin. John Hay was generally alone in the house, and even when he had company, his friends could not hear the clamorous uncle. The shadow inside his brain grew larger and blacker. His fear of death was driving John Hay mad.|$|E
60|$|It {{gave him}} a shock to see Ida's fateful letter lying upon the <b>hat-rack</b> in his boarding-house, {{where it had been}} pawed over by the whole household. He hastened to his room, and dropped into a chair with that {{familiar}} terrible numbness in his limbs, and with his heart beating so hard it shortened his breathing. He was like a man breathless with running. When his eyes fell on the writing, his hands ceased to shake, and his quick breathing fell away into a long, shuddering inspiration. He read the first page twice without moving a muscle. Then he turned the page, and finished it. It was not long, and it was very direct.|$|E
60|$|The woman led him {{up another}} flight of {{steps to the}} open door of the house, through a hallway covered with a ragged carpet, where a {{dilapidated}} walnut <b>hat-rack</b> stood, up the stairs, threading a dark passage that led into a low-ceiled, stifling room at the very back. A stout, slatternly person in a wrapper rose as they entered, but the mother cast herself down beside the lounge where the child was. Hodder had a moment of fear that she was indeed too late, so still the boy lay, so pathetically wan was the little face and wasted the form under the cotton nightgown. The mother passed her hand across his forehead.|$|E
60|$|Now, that <b>hat-rack</b> was oak-thirty shillings, at least. McPhee came down-stairs with a sober foot--he {{steps as}} lightly as a cat, {{for all his}} weight, when he is at sea--and shook hands {{in a new and}} awful manner--a parody of old Holdock's style when he says good-bye to his skippers. I {{perceived}} at once that a legacy had come to him, but I held my peace, though Mrs. McPhee begged me every thirty seconds to eat a great deal and say nothing. It was rather a mad sort of meal, because McPhee and his wife took hold of hands like little children (they always do after voyages), and nodded and winked and choked and gurgled, and hardly ate a mouthful.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the town}} of Nankiwoc the hotel was not all it might have been. Evelyn L'Ewysse {{announced}} that she was [...] "good and sick of eating a vaudeville dinner with the grub acts stuck around your plate {{in a lot of}} birds' bath-tubs--little mess of turnips and a dab of spinach and a fried cockroach. And when it comes to sleeping another night on a bed like a gridiron, no--thank--you! And believe me, if I see that old rube hotel-keeper comb his whiskers at the hall <b>hat-rack</b> again--he keeps a baby comb in his vest pocket with a lead-pencil and a cigar some drummer gave him--if I have to watch him comb that alfalfa again I'll bite his ears off and get pinched by the S. P. C. A.!" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was not so}} splendid a quest as she had hoped; it was too sharp {{a revelation}} of the cannon-food of the city, {{the people who had}} never been trained, and who had lost heart. It was {{scarcely}} possible to tell one street from another; to remember whether she was on Sixteenth Street or Twenty-sixth. Always the same rows of red-brick or brownstone houses, all alike, the monotony broken only by infrequent warehouses or loft-buildings; always the same doubtful mounting of stone steps, the same searching for a bell, the same waiting, the same slatternly, suspicious landlady, the same evil hallway with a brown <b>hat-rack,</b> a steel-engraving with one corner stained with yellow, a carpet worn through to the flooring in a large oval hole {{just in front of the}} stairs, a smell of cabbage, a lack of ventilation. Always the same desire to escape, though she waited politely while the landlady in the same familiar harsh voice went through the same formula.|$|E
60|$|When grown-up persons {{indulge in}} {{practical}} jokes, the fact gauges them. They have lived narrow, obscure, and ignorant lives, and at full manhood they still retain and cherish a job-lot of left-over standards and ideals {{that would have}} been discarded with their boyhood if they had then moved out into the world and a broader life. There were many practical jokers in the new Territory. I do not take pleasure in exposing this fact, for I liked those people; but what I am saying is true. I wish I could say a kindlier thing about them instead--that they were burglars, or <b>hat-rack</b> thieves, or something like that, that wouldn't be utterly uncomplimentary. I would prefer it, but I can't say those things, they would not be true. These people were practical jokers, and I will not try to disguise it. In other respects they were plenty good-enough people; honest people; reputable and likable. They played practical jokes upon each other with success, and got the admiration and applause and also the envy {{of the rest of the}} community. Naturally they were eager to try their arts on big game, and that was what the Governor was. But they were not able to score. They made several efforts, but the Governor defeated these efforts without any trouble and went on smiling his pleasant smile as if nothing had happened. Finally the joker chiefs of Carson City and Virginia City conspired together to see if their combined talent couldn't win a victory, for the jokers were getting into a very uncomfortable place: the people were laughing at them, instead of at their proposed victim. They banded themselves together to the number of ten and invited the Governor to what was a most extraordinary attention in those days--pickled oyster stew and champagne--luxuries very seldom seen in that region, and existing rather as fabrics of the imagination than as facts.|$|E
6000|$|Then we lounged {{through many}} and many a sumptuous private mansion {{which we could}} not have entered without a formal {{invitation}} in incomprehensible Latin, in the olden time, when the owners lived there--and we probably wouldn't have got it. These people built their houses a good deal alike. The floors were laid in fanciful figures wrought in mosaics of many-colored marbles. At the threshold your eyes fall upon a Latin sentence of welcome, sometimes, or a picture of a dog, with the legend [...] "Beware of the Dog," [...] and sometimes a picture of a bear or a faun with no inscription at all. Then you enter a sort of vestibule, where they used to keep the <b>hat-rack,</b> I suppose; next a room with a large marble basin in the midst and the pipes of a fountain; on either side are bedrooms; beyond the fountain is a reception-room, then a little garden, dining-room, and so forth and so on. The floors were all mosaic, the walls were stuccoed, or frescoed, or ornamented with bas-reliefs, and here and there were statues, large and small, and little fish-pools, and cascades of sparkling water that sprang from secret places in the colonnade of handsome pillars that surrounded the court, and kept the flower-beds fresh and the air cool. Those Pompeiians were very luxurious in their tastes and habits. The most exquisite bronzes we have seen in Europe, came from the exhumed cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii, and also the finest cameos and the most delicate engravings on precious stones; their pictures, eighteen or nineteen centuries old, are often much more pleasing than the celebrated rubbish of the old masters of three centuries ago. They were well up in art. From the creation of these works of the first, clear up to the eleventh century, art seems hardly to have existed at all--at least no remnants of it are left--and it was curious to see how far (in some things, at any rate,) these old time pagans excelled the remote generations of masters that came after them. The pride of the world in sculptures seem to be the Laocoon and the Dying Gladiator, in Rome. They are as old as Pompeii, were dug from the earth like Pompeii; but their exact age or who made them can only be conjectured. But worn, and cracked, without a history, and with the blemishing stains of numberless centuries upon them, they still mutely mock at all efforts to rival their perfections.|$|E
60|$|She {{had just}} come down to see Doctor Prance--to see whether she wouldn't like to come up. But she wasn't in her room, and Miss Birdseye guessed she had gone out to her supper; she got her supper at a boarding-table about two blocks off. Miss Birdseye {{expressed}} the hope that Miss Chancellor had had hers; {{she would have had}} plenty of time to take it, for no one had come in yet; she didn't know what made them all so late. Ransom perceived that the garments suspended to the <b>hat-rack</b> were not a sign that Miss Birdseye's friends had assembled; if he had gone a little further still he would have recognised the house as one of those in which mysterious articles of clothing are always hooked to something in the hall. Miss Birdseye's visitors, those of Doctor Prance, and of other tenants--for Number 756 was the common residence of several persons, among whom there prevailed much vagueness of boundary--used to leave things to be called for; many of them went about with satchels and reticules, for which they were always looking for places of deposit. What completed the character of this interior was Miss Birdseye's own apartment, into which her guests presently made their way, and where they were joined by various other members of the good lady's circle. Indeed, it completed Miss Birdseye herself, if anything could be said to render that office to this essentially formless old woman, who had no more outline than a bundle of hay. But the bareness of her long, loose, empty parlour (it was shaped exactly like Miss Chancellor's) told that she had never had any needs but moral needs, and that all her history had been that of her sympathies. The place was lighted by a small hot glare of gas, which made it look white and featureless. It struck even Basil Ransom with its flatness, and he said to himself that his cousin must have a very big bee in her bonnet to make her like such a house. He did not know then, and he never knew, that she mortally disliked it, and that in a career in which she was constantly exposing herself to offence and laceration, her most poignant suffering came from the injury of her taste. She had tried to kill that nerve, to persuade herself that taste was only frivolity in the disguise of knowledge; but her susceptibility was constantly blooming afresh and making her wonder whether an absence of nice arrangements were a necessary part of the enthusiasm of humanity. Miss Birdseye was always trying to obtain employment, lessons in drawing, orders for portraits, for poor foreign artists, as to the greatness of whose talent she pledged herself without reserve; but in point of fact she had not the faintest sense of the scenic or plastic side of life.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was good}} to me when we first met, because I did not ask questions, and {{believed}} in Charles Reade as a most shamefully neglected author. Later he approved of my writings {{to the extent of}} one pamphlet of twenty-four pages that I wrote for Holdock, Steiner & Chase, owners of the line, when they bought some ventilating patent and fitted it to the cabins of the Breslau, Spandau, and Koltzau. The purser of the Breslau recommended me to Holdock's secretary for the job; and Holdock, who is a Wesleyan Methodist, invited me to his house, and gave me dinner with the governess when the others had finished, and placed the plans and specifications in my hand, and I wrote the pamphlet that same afternoon. It was called [...] "Comfort in the Cabin," [...] and brought me seven pound ten, cash down--an important sum of money in those days; and the governess, who was teaching Master John Holdock his scales, told me that Mrs. Holdock had told her {{to keep an eye on}} me, in case I went away with coats from the <b>hat-rack.</b> McPhee liked that pamphlet enormously, for it was composed in the Bouverie-Byzantine style, with baroque and rococo embellishments; and afterwards he introduced me to Mrs. McPhee, who succeeded Dinah in my heart; for Dinah was half a world away, and it is wholesome and antiseptic to love such a woman as Janet McPhee. They lived in a little twelve-pound house, close to the shipping. When McPhee was away Mrs. McPhee read the Lloyds column in the papers, and called on the wives of senior engineers of equal social standing. Once or twice, too, Mrs. Holdock visited Mrs. McPhee in a brougham with celluloid fittings, and I have reason to believe that, after she had played owner's wife long enough, they talked scandal. The Holdocks lived in an old-fashioned house with a big brick garden not a mile from the McPhees, for they stayed by their money as their money stayed by them; and in summer you met their brougham solemnly junketing by Theydon Bois or Loughton. But I was Mrs. McPhee's friend, for she allowed me to convoy her westward, sometimes, to theatres where she sobbed or laughed or shivered with a simple heart; and she introduced me to a new world of doctors' wives, captains' wives, and engineers' wives, whose whole talk and thought centred in and about ships and lines of ships you have never heard of. There were sailing-ships, with stewards and mahogany and maple saloons, trading to Australia, taking cargoes of consumptives and hopeless drunkards for whom a sea-voyage was recommended; there were frowzy little West African boats, full of rats and cockroaches, where men died anywhere but in their bunks; there were Brazilian boats whose cabins could be hired for merchandise, that went out loaded nearly awash; there were Zanzibar and Mauritius steamers and wonderful reconstructed boats that plied to the other tide of Borneo. These were loved and known, for they earned our bread and a little butter, and we despised the big Atlantic boats, and made fun of the P. & O. and Orient liners, and swore by our respective owners--Wesleyan, Baptist, or Presbyterian, as the case might be.|$|E
