25|$|Natural {{selection}} for genomic imprinting requires genetic variation in a population. A hypothesis for {{the origin of}} this genetic variation states that the host-defense system responsible for silencing foreign DNA elements, such as genes of viral origin, mistakenly silenced genes whose silencing turned out to be beneficial for the organism. There appears to be an over-representation of retrotransposed genes, that is to say genes that are inserted into the genome by viruses, among imprinted genes. It has also been postulated that if the retrotransposed gene is inserted close to another imprinted gene, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>just</b> acquire this imprint.|$|E

The assemblage, while less diverse than the Ediacara- or Nama-types, resembles Carboniferous suspension-feeding communities, which may suggest filter feeding – by most interpretations, the assemblage is found in water too deep for photosynthesis. The low diversity may reflect the depth of water – which would restrict speciation opportunities – or <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>just</b> be too young for a rich biota to have evolved.

500|$|The {{songs on}} So Beautiful or So What touch on {{subjects}} such as love, mortality, and faith. In terms of songwriting, Simon did not approach each new song with a theme; instead, he let them evolve naturally from the first line he would compose. Simon {{had no plans to}} pursue religious writing, but it ended up particularly strong in the album’s lyrics. He noted that [...] "five of the first six" [...] songs he wrote touched on themes of God: [...] "I wondered whether there was a subconscious theme that I was tapping into. I have used Christian symbols and imagery before in songs. It’s very strongly evocative, so <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>just</b> be coincidence—but it may not be." [...] The A.V. Club suggested that the album's gospel influence inspired the touch of humor when discussing dark {{subjects such as}} death.|$|E

Riker learns from Beata that their society structure has already been collapsing, but Ramsey and his men have served to accelerate its decline.

500|$|The maximum {{practical}} {{number of}} oar ranks a ship could have logistically was three (Greek and Latin tri-). [...] Beyond three, {{the number in}} the type name did not refer {{to the number of}} ranks of oars any more (as for biremes and triremes, respectively two and three ranks of oars with one rower per oar), but to the number of rowers per vertical section, with several men on each oar. [...] Indeed, just because a ship was designated with a larger type number did not mean it necessarily had or operated all three possible ranks: the quadrireme may have been a simple evolution of a standard trireme, but with two rowers on the top oar; it may also have been a bireme with two men on each oar; or <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>just</b> have had a single rank with four men on a each single oar. [...] Classes of ship could differ in their configuration between regions and over time, but in no case did a [...] "four" [...] ship have four horizontal ranks of oars.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{broadcast}} in the United States on NBC on Monday, September 21, 1998, in the 9:3010 p.m. (PST) timeslot. In its original American broadcast, the pilot tied with Working for forty-first place in {{ratings for the}} week of September 21–27, 1998. With a Nielsen rating of 8.6, equivalent to approximately 8.4 million viewing households, it was the fifteenth-highest-rated show on NBC the week it aired. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Joyce Millman of Salon Entertainment said the episode has [...] "glimmers of class" [...] and the jokes are [...] "relatively sophisticated". John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that Burrows's direction was [...] "sharp as usual" [...] and the writing was [...] "above average". Brian Lambert of the St. Paul Pioneer Press said the pilot was [...] "nicely staged by veteran director Jimmy Burrows, and coming from a couple producers, Max Mutchnick and David Cohan, who assisted Boston Common and Dream On, the show – {{which is to say}} the pilot episode (everything could go to hell next week) – has the best verbal interplay of any of the season's new sitcoms." [...] William Horn from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) thought the episode was a [...] "wonderful" [...] representation of a gay man's life [...] "regardless of whether he's in a relationship in that very moment. I think it's important that American audiences realize that lesbians and gay men are not simply all about sexual situations." [...] Ellen Gray of the Chicago Tribune was also positive about the show: [...] "For those who believe that Hollywood's engaging in a conspiracy to 'normalize' a sexual orientation that many Americans still find abhorrent, Will & Grace will look like a candy-coated poison pill. To those who think that Hollywood isn't moving fast enough in offering sexual parity for gays, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>just</b> look like poison. But... there's a large audience out there that's somewhere in the mushy middle, an audience that might be ready to embrace Will & Grace." ...|$|E

[...] He also admitted that it was completely different from his previous work and said that [...] " [...] deals with a very complex drama. And I may not nail it on this film, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>just</b> be my first step." [...] Reitman wanted to make the film right after his 2009 film Up in the Air, but due to Winslet's scheduling conflicts, he chose to direct Young Adult first.|$|E
2500|$|Citing an Akkadian {{term that}} {{indicates}} a yellow or orange dye, Alter {{argued that the}} word , techashim in [...] is more plausibly translated as [...] "ocher-dyed skins" [...] than [...] "dolphin skins" [...] or [...] "dugong skins." [...] Alter argued that the yellow or orange coloring would be {{in keeping with the}} brilliantly dyed stuff in [...] Professor Richard Elliott Friedman of the University of Georgia wrote that no one knows what the term means, noting that it has been translated to be dolphin skins, badger skins, goatskins, and skins of a particular color. Friedman wrote that it is a cognate of an Arabic word for dolphin, but, since it does not occur in the list of animals that are forbidden or permitted for food in [...] it may not refer to a particular species of animal at all. Friedman concluded that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>just</b> mean tanned skins or leather.|$|E
2500|$|The king {{spent the}} next two years {{preparing}} for war against Siam, which he considered his unfinished business. He set up a garrison at Tavoy (Dawei) on 17 June 1562. But he first wanted to bring trans-Salween Shan states to his fold, probably to get more manpower as well as to secure the rear. To be sure, the Burmese chronicles state that he was merely responding to a July 1562 rebellion by his cis-Salween Chinese Shan states with support from trans-Salween Shan states. However, as with Manipur, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>just</b> have been a pretext. He sent four 12,000-strong armies, each led by Nanda, [...] Thado Dhamma Yaza II, Minkhaung II and Thado Minsaw. The southernmost trans-Salween state of Kengtung submitted prior to the invasion on 16 December 1562. The armies launched a two-pronged invasion of the Taping valley in March/April 1563. The armies faced minimal resistance, and secured the allegiance of the local saophas. Bayinnaung now had at least nominal suzerainty over Chinese Shan states from the cis-Salween states in the Taping valley to Kenghung (present-day Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan) in the east.|$|E

2500|$|Scott Miller {{chose to}} name his new band [...] "Game Theory" [...] as {{an allusion to}} the {{mathematical}} field of game theory, which he described as [...] "the study of calculating the most appropriate action given an adversary, ... someone who was thinking against you, {{and you had to}} organize what his moves could be, and what your moves should be, to give yourself the minimum amount of failure." [...] In a 1988 interview, Miller stated, [...] "It's a theory of probability that's a mathematical discipline that more or less has been applied improperly to real-life situations. It's just that idea of a set of rules that gets misused that intrigued me about it.... kind of a telling comment on life in general—that you just have {{to have some sort of}} set of rules, but who knows what the set of rules should be." [...] That theme, according to Miller, was what many Game Theory songs were about: [...] "Always be wary of the superstructure of whatever situation you're in. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>just</b> be that the whole game that you're into is something very bogus and you should get out." ...|$|E

Felicitously scattered and grouped, we might in almost any case have had the air of looking for a message from it--of an imagination to be flattered, nerves to be quieted, sensibilities to be soothed. The whole scene was as composed as if there were scarce one of us but had a secret thirst for the infinite to be quenched. And it was the infinite that, for the hour, the distinguished foreigner poured out to us, causing it to roll in wonderful waves of sound, almost of colour, over our receptive attitudes and faces. Each of us, I think, now wore the expression--or confessed at least to the suggestion--of some indescribable thought; which might well, it was true, have been nothing more unmentionable than the simple sense of how the posture of deference to this noble art has always a certain personal grace to contribute. We neglected nothing of it that could make our general effect ample, and whether or no we were kept quiet by the piano, we were at least admonished, to and fro, by our mutual visibility, which each of us clearly, desired to make a success. I have little doubt, furthermore, that to each of us was due, as the crown of our inimitable day, the imputation of having something quite of our own to think over.|$|E
