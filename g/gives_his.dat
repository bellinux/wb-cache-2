5|$|After the Second World War, Moore's bronzes took {{on their}} larger scale, which was {{particularly}} suited for public art commissions. As {{a matter of}} practicality, he largely abandoned direct carving, and took on several assistants to help produce the larger forms based on maquettes. By {{the end of the}} 1940s, he produced sculptures increasingly by modelling, working out the shape in clay or plaster before casting the final work in bronze using the lost wax technique. These maquettes often began as small forms shaped by Moore's hands—a process which <b>gives</b> <b>his</b> work an organic feeling. They are from the body.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} theoretical {{decision for}} White {{is to choose}} whether to play a2–a3. While this move protects the b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:It was {{not so long ago}} that 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it <b>gives</b> <b>his</b> queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.|$|E

5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His {{frequent}} use of archaic and unusual words <b>gives</b> <b>his</b> prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period.

5|$|Gaudí's work is {{normally}} classed as modernista, and {{it belongs to}} this movement because of its eagerness to renovate without breaking with tradition, its quest for modernity, the ornamental sense applied to works, and the multidisciplinary character of its undertakings, where craftsmanship plays a central role. To this, Gaudí adds a dose of the baroque, adopts technical advances and continues to use traditional architectural language. Together with his inspiration from nature and the original touch of his works, this amalgam <b>gives</b> <b>his</b> works their personal and unique character {{in the history of}} architecture.|$|E

Jekyll arrives; Utterson confronts him about the will, but Jekyll refuses to consider changing it.|$|E
5|$|Theobald's {{family was}} from the area around Thierville near Le Bec-Hellouin, in the Risle River valley. The modern {{historian}} Frank Barlow speculates that Theobald {{may have been a}} distant relative of his successor as archbishop, Thomas Becket, as Becket's family came from the same part of Normandy. The exact date of Theobald's birth is unknown; the only clue to his age is that when he died in 1161 contemporaries considered him an old man, suggesting a birth date of perhaps around 1090 to one modern historian. His father was supposedly a knight, but no contemporary reference <b>gives</b> <b>his</b> name. His brother Walter also became a priest, and later a bishop.|$|E
