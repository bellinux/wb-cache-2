The information on configuration, functional description, and shipping and storage containers of the Mk 7 bomb dispenser and its associated components {{can be found in}} NAVAIR 11-5A-3, also information on <b>decanning,</b> preparation for use, and recanning procedures are found in NAVAIR 11-140-9. MK 20 MODS/CBU-99/CBU-100, BOMB CLUSTER CONFIGURATIONS The configurations of the Mk 20 Mods/ CBU-99/CBU-100 are listed in the table below. Mk 7 and Mods Bomb Dispenser The cargo section of the Mk 7 bomb dispenser is the main structure of the weapon and contains the bombs/bomblets. A nose fairing is attached to the forward end of the cargo section for aerodynamics and fuze installation. It has an observation window for viewing the safe/arm indicator on the installed fuze. The dispenser has two linear-shaped charges secured longitudinally inside the walls. When initiated, these shaped charges cut the dispenser in half, from front to rear, and the bombs/bomblets spread in free-fall trajectories.|$|E
40|$|Remotely operated, {{semi-automatic}} machines, {{designed to}} effect the mechanical disassembly (i. e., <b>decanning)</b> of spent fuel elements from the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II, were developed. The machines described are laboratory models which successfully decanned simulated fuel elements. They are electrically or pneumatically operated and are capable of <b>decanning</b> three fuel elements per minute without the routine use of manipulators. Each machine {{is made up of}} functional units which are sequentially placed to eliminate handling between steps of the <b>decanning</b> operation and which are easily removable for replacement or maintenance. In the first of the two machines described, pneumatically operated devices prepare the fuel element for a rotary shearing operation which cuts the tubing jacket along a helical circumferential path as it is being removed. The alternate machine removes the jacket by means of a series of shearing rolls. Both machines are served by auxiliary mechanisms, such as inspection jigs, fuel and scrap choppers, and transfer magazines. (auth...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Decans</b> first {{appeared}} in the 10th Dynasty (2100 BCE) on coffin lids. [...] The sequence of these star patterns began with Sothis/Sirius, and each <b>decan</b> contained a set of stars and corresponding divinities. As measures of time, the rising and setting of <b>decans</b> marked 'hours' and groups of 10 days which comprised an Egyptian year. The ancient Book of Nut, covers the subject of the <b>decans.</b>|$|R
50|$|There were 36 <b>decans</b> (36 X 10 = 360 days), plus 5 added days {{to compose}} the 365 {{days of a}} solar based year. <b>Decans</b> measure sidereal time and the solar year is 6 hours longer; the Sothic and solar years in the Egyptian {{calendar}} realign every 1460 years. <b>Decans</b> represented on coffins from later dynasties (such as King Seti I) compared with earlier <b>decan</b> images demonstrate the Sothic-solar shift.|$|R

40|$|Work {{continued}} on four major tasks {{of this project}} [...] increasing the circumferential strength of MA 956 tubing, joining of the MA 956 alloy, determining the bending limits of MA 956 tubing, and determination of the high temperature corrosion limits of the MA 956 alloy. With respect to increasing the circumferential strength of a MA 956 tube, all of the extrusions plus <b>decanning</b> operations have been completed (total of 180 rods) for Task 2. 1. 1 (Extrusion Ratio = 20 : 1, 16 : 1, 10 : 1 and Extrusion Temperature = 1000, 1075, 1150, and 1200 C). Also, essentially all of the cold working operations have been completed (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 %) with approximately 100 annealing treatments (1000, 1150, 1300 C) remaining. The sample microstructures produced by this processing continue to be analyzed. Creep testing to determine the ''stress threshold'' curves for this alloy continues. Regarding joining of the MA 956 alloy, advances were made using transient liquid phase bonding. And finally, laboratory high temperature corrosion testing of the material continues (both fluid-side and fire-side) with fabrication of the field probes initiated...|$|E
40|$|Two {{alternate}} systems, acetic acid-nickel and acetic acid-cobalt, {{were examined}} for possible {{replacement of the}} corrosion system: ferric chloride-nickel which is {{being used in the}} current transpiration corrosion protection studies. Two Fluorox fluidized bed runs were made, of 9 and 58 hr duration, in which dry air and oxygen were used as oxidizing and fluidizing gases. Tests of the hydroclone classification of thoria indicated that more than 95 % of the + 0. 5 micron particles can be removed from a sample if 50 % recovery of the - 0. 5 micron particles is acceptable. Fluidized bed denitration of ThNT did not produce large dense ThO/sub 2 / particles, but flame denitration of mixed thorium-uranium- aluminum nitrates produced spherical particles. Three alternate batch Darex flowsheets gave chloride removal to less than 350 ppm with 61 % nitric acid feed, while dissolution studies of APPR fuel elements showed that complete dissolution of braze metal in aqua regia may be difficult. Leaching studies of unirradiated UO/sub 2 / pellets showed that the most important variable effecting dissolution rate was the total nitrate content of the dissolvent. Delivery of tae SRE <b>decanning</b> equipment was scheduled for April 1, 1959. Temperatare increases in cylinders of solid radioactive waste were calculated for APPR fuel processing using a Darex flowsheet and cooling times ranging from 1 to 8 yr. (auth...|$|E

5000|$|After astrology was {{introduced}} to Egypt, various systems attributing astrological significance to <b>decans</b> arose. <b>Decans</b> were connected, for example, with various diseases and with the timing for the engraving of talismans for curing them; with decanic [...] "faces" [...] (or [...] "phases"), a system where three <b>decans</b> are assigned to each zodiacal sign, each covering 10° of the zodiac, and each ruled by a planetary ruler (see below); and correlated with astrological signs.|$|R
5000|$|Images of the <b>decans</b> are {{described}} in Hermetic writings, by the Indian astrologer Varāhamihira, in the Picatrix, and in Japanese writings. [...] Varāhamihira's images of the <b>decans</b> was influenced by Greco-Egyptian, if not Hermetic, depictions of the <b>decans</b> {{by way of the}} Yavanajataka. [...] Their role in Japanese astrology may have derived from an earlier Chinese or Indian form possibly from adding the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac to a list of twenty-four hour stars. [...] They were most common between the Kamakura and Edo periods.The first original <b>Decan</b> position due to the precession in ancient times started at 0' degrees of Cancer when the heliacal rising of Sirius (Egyptian Sepdet; Greco-Egyptian: Sothis) on sunset like Jewish and Islamic calendars marking the Egyptian New Year and now the 1st <b>decan</b> falls on 0' degrees of Leo at July 20 in the Julian calendar, that is July 22/23 on the Gregorian calendar.|$|R

50|$|In chapter 18, {{the demons}} of the 36 <b>decans</b> appear, with names that {{sometimes}} {{seem to be}} conscious distortions of the traditional names for the <b>decans.</b> The <b>decan</b> demons claim responsibility mostly for various ailments and pains, and they provide the magical formulae by which they may be banished. For example, the thirty-third demon is Rhyx Achoneoth who causes sore throat and tonsilitis and can be driven off by writing the word Leikourgos on ivy leaves and heaping them into a pile.|$|R
50|$|The <b>decans</b> were {{a system}} of time {{measurement}} according to the constellations. They were led by the constellation Sothis or Sirius. The risings of the <b>decans</b> in the night were used to divide the night into ‘hours’. The rising of a constellation just before sunrise (its heliacal rising) was considered the last hour of the night. Over {{the course of the}} year, each constellation rose just before sunrise for ten days. When they became part of the astrology of the Hellenistic Age, each <b>decan</b> was associated with ten degrees of the zodiac. Texts from the 2nd century BCE list predictions relating to the positions of planets in zodiac signs {{at the time of the}} rising of certain <b>decans,</b> particularly Sothis.|$|R
50|$|In modern times, {{however, the}} {{assignment}} of <b>decans</b> has changed considerably. Each sign is allocated a triplicity, such as air, water, earth or fire. Each sign is therefore subdivided into three equal parts of 10 degrees each, and these parts {{are referred to as}} <b>decans,</b> or decanates.|$|R

50|$|I {{suspect that}} Metrodorus was versed in astrology, for astrologers divided the zodiac not only into 12 signs, but also into 36 <b>decans,</b> each {{covering}} ten degrees; for each <b>decan</b> {{there was an}} associated decan-figure. Metrodorus probably grouped ten artificial backgrounds (loci) under each <b>decan</b> figure. He would thus {{have a series of}} loci numbered 1 to 360, which he could use in his operations. With a little calculation he could find any background (locus) by its number, and he was insured against missing a background, since all were arranged in numerical order. His system was therefore well designed for the performance of striking feats of memory.|$|R
