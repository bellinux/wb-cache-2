5|$|Tropical Storm Franklin was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} storm over the western Atlantic Ocean during July of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the sixth named storm {{of the season and}} twice approached hurricane strength. The storm formed over the Bahamas on July 21 then moved north erratically, approaching Bermuda on July 26. Franklin eventually became extratropical near Newfoundland on July 30, before being absorbed by a larger system. The National Hurricane Center struggled to predict Tropical Storm Franklin mainly due to difficulties <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> effects of wind shear. There were only minor effects on land from Tropical Storm Franklin and no damages were caused. The name Franklin was used for the first time because of Hurricane Floyd which was retired in the 1999 season.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the season}} — nearly two months earlier than the first storm {{formation}} in 2004 — a low-pressure area formed and persisted north of Honduras. Despite significant shear, the low managed to become Tropical Depression One on June 8 just north of Honduras. The depression began to head north towards western Cuba that day, but {{as it was a}} very large and poorly organized system under the influence of heavy shear, the official forecasts from the National Hurricane Center emphasized that the route the storm would take was uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, the official forecasts were highly accurate <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> storm's track. As the shear dropped, the depression strengthened further and it became Tropical Storm Arlene on June 9. It produced precipitation over a very wide area; the Cayman Islands reported tropical storm-force winds and heavy rain over 150 statute miles (240km) east of the center. Arlene crossed the western tip of Cuba on the morning of June 10 with 50mph (85km/h) winds. Tropical Storm Arlene had an unusual structure throughout its life, with a large circulation containing numerous small centers rotating about a larger gyre, as opposed to an inner convective core.|$|E

25|$|Cells with {{heterozygous}} mutations (one good copy of {{gene and}} one mutated copy) may function normally with the unmutated copy until the good copy has been spontaneously somatically mutated.

25|$|The {{results of}} his {{observations}} did not fit Ptolemy's model at all. Concluding that the model was inadequate, Gersonides tried (unsuccessfully) to improve on it. That challenge was finally answered, of course, by Copernicus three centuries later, but Gersonides {{was the first to}} falsify the Alexandrian dogma - the first known instance of modern falsification philosophy. Levi also showed that Ptolemy's model for the Lunar orbit, though reproducing correctly the evolution of the Moon's position, fails completely <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> apparent sizes of the Moon in its motion. Unfortunately, {{there is no evidence that}} the findings influenced later generations of astronomers, even though Gersonides' writings were translated and available.|$|E

30|$|After OBME, every {{motion vector}} per {{overlapping}} block is upscaled {{by a factor}} ξ, after which the upscaled motion field is used to motion-compensate blocks ξβ of size ξB[*]×[*]ξB from the original reference frames. Since these blocks are overlapping as well, every pixel position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>predicted</b> frame belongs {{to a number of}} overlapping blocks ξβ, each of them linked with their best matching blocks in each of the reference frames. The pixels in these best matching blocks act as temporal predictors for the co-located pixels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>predicted</b> block. <b>In</b> this way, every pixel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>predicted</b> frame is linked to a set of candidate predictor pixels. Finally, the pixel values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>predicted</b> WZ frame are calculated as the average of the candidate temporal predictors at every pixel position.|$|R
25|$|Second, {{for each}} {{explanatory}} variable of interest, {{one wants to}} know whether its estimated coefficient differs significantly from zero—that is, whether this particular explanatory variable in fact has explanatory power <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> response variable. Here the null hypothesis is that the true coefficient is zero. This hypothesis is tested by computing the coefficient's t-statistic, as {{the ratio of the}} coefficient estimate to its standard error. If the t-statistic is larger than a predetermined value, the null hypothesis is rejected and the variable is found to have explanatory power, with its coefficient significantly different from zero. Otherwise, the null hypothesis of a zero value of the true coefficient is accepted.|$|E
25|$|Even single neurons have complex biophysical {{characteristics}} and can perform computations (e.g.). Hodgkin and Huxley's original model only employed two voltage-sensitive currents (Voltage sensitive ion channels are glycoprotein molecules which extend through the lipid bilayer, allowing ions to traverse {{under certain conditions}} through the axolemma), the fast-acting sodium and the inward-rectifying potassium. Though successful <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> timing and qualitative features of the action potential, it nevertheless failed to predict {{a number of important}} features such as adaptation and shunting. Scientists now believe that there are a wide variety of voltage-sensitive currents, and the implications of the differing dynamics, modulations, and sensitivity of these currents is an important topic of computational neuroscience.|$|E
25|$|Male Banggai {{cardinalfish}} also exhibit preference by size, as larger females tend to lay larger eggs, and egg size positively affects traits such as offspring size, survival, growth, {{time until}} maturation, and swimming performance. However, {{it also takes}} into account information conveyed by females’ courting movement. The ‘side by side trembling’ described {{in the previous section}} can be subcategorized into two different movements: ‘rush’ and ‘twitch’. ‘Rush’ refers to {{the first part of the}} movement when the females approaches the male, folding the pelvic, dorsal and anal fins together and quickly swimming past the male for a distance of 10-40 centimeters. Then it performs the ‘twitch’, where it twitches, or trembles her body close to the male. Studies have shown that the intensity of the ‘rush’ behavior is important for the male <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> <b>the</b> female’s potential reproductive effort, as the intensity of the behavior correlates positively with clutch weight. On the other hand, the number of twitches performed per day strongly associates with how close to spawning the female is. By forming a pair with a female with more mature eggs, or closer to spawning, a male can increase his reproductive rate. Furthermore, it can match his readiness to spawn to females’ by observing its ‘twitch’ behavior.|$|E
