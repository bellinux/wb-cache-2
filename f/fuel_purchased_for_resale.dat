Most of these sub-distributors were in cities in which the direct distributors themselves did not (at least as yet) have warehouses, including Philadelphia, Boston, Columbus (Ohio), Madison (Wisconsin), Lansing (Michigan), Indianapolis, and Berkeley (California).

PRODCOM (Products of the European Community) is a European Union (EU) wide survey of production mainly for the manufacturing industries collected under Council Regulation (EEC) No 3924 / 91. PRODCOM is classified to the Commerce Energy and Industry National Statistics Theme Group. Manufacturing (excluding recycling) and mineral extraction are sub-divided into a list of around 3, 800 products. Companies selected for PRODCOM supply value sales data (as a proxy for production) for the products they manufacture, as well as non-manufacturing income. In addition, companies in approximately {{three quarters of the}} covered industries supply volume sales data. Linking to other business studies These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register reference numbers. These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations. Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together. You may consider applying for other business data to assist your research. For the sixth edition (May 2016), an updated version of the 2010 data file, the final data files for 2012 and 2013, and the intermediate data file for 2014 have been added. Main Topics : Businesses are asked for the value of sales for all of their products. Some industries are also asked for the volume of products they manufacture. They are also asked for merchanted goods (goods <b>purchased</b> <b>for</b> <b>resale</b> without processing), work done (work done on material supplied by a customer), waste products (value of sales of waste products) and non-production income (income derived from provision of services and non-production activities). If sales of a particular product are less than £ 25, 000, these can be recorded as 'other sales' rather than being split by product...|$|R
