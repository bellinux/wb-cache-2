50|$|When {{elements}} representing {{two factors}} {{are required for}} authentication, the term two-factor authentication is applied—e.g. a bankcard (something the user has) and a PIN (something the user knows). Business networks may require users to provide a password (knowledge factor) and a pseudorandom number from a security token (ownership factor). Access to a very-high-security system might require a mantrap screening of height, weight, facial, and <b>fingerprint</b> <b>checks</b> (several inherence factor elements) plus a PIN and a day code (knowledge factor elements), but {{this is still a}} two-factor authentication.|$|R

30|$|Secure Communities is a data-based program {{currently}} {{in place in}} practically all of the nation’s jails and prisons. It establishes a <b>fingerprinting</b> <b>check</b> process that starts with a local or state law enforcement agent taking the fingerprints of an arrested individual. The process ends with ICE’s Law Enforcement Support Center generating a report that may include a criminal-level classification. 8 Overall, {{the purpose of the}} program is to identify noncitizens who have committed serious crimes by using biometric information that is checked against the immigration and criminal records in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) databases.|$|R

The NIGC strongly resisted the imposition of the shut down order and, in doing so, helped establish its status as an independent federal agency. Following a May 14, 2008, order of the D.C. District Court, BIA and other Interior bureaus and offices were reconnected to the Internet.|$|R

One day in the spring of 2011, he confronts a group of young men harassing passengers on the subway, resulting in their arrest. Reese is taken to the NYPD 8th Precinct, where he is questioned by Detective Joss Carter. Carter recognizes his skills as military in origin, but Reese says little in response to her questions, piquing her curiosity. A <b>fingerprint</b> <b>check</b> suggests Reese has been at several recent crime scenes, but before Carter can learn more, Reese leaves with an expensive attorney. They are met by a car and driver, which takes him to a park under the Queensboro Bridge, where Reese first meets Harold Finch.|$|E
50|$|In 1961 {{he began}} a {{relationship}} with Edith Lieblang, one of the waitresses at the bar where he was working. The couple moved to Plochingen and opened a dance bar, which was a modest success. Kujau began to create a fictional background for himself, telling people his real name was Peter Fischer, changing his date of birth by two years, and altering the history {{of his time in}} East Germany. by 1963 the bar began suffering financial difficulties, and the couple moved back to Stuttgart, where Kujau found work as a waiter. He also started his career as a counterfeiter, forging DM 27 worth of luncheon vouchers; he was caught and sentenced to five days in prison. On his release he and his wife formed the Lieblang Cleaning Company, although the company provided little income for them. In March 1968, at a routine check at Kujau's lodgings, the police established he was living under a false identity, after the name, address and date of birth details Kujau provided for the police were different to those on the papers he was carrying at the time. At the police station he offered a third set of details and a false explanation as to why he was masquerading under an assumed identity, but the subsequent <b>fingerprint</b> <b>check</b> confirmed he was Kujau. He was sent to Stuttgart's Stammheim Prison.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In 2005, Ginger Myles and Hongxia Jin {{proposed}} a software watermarking {{scheme based on}} converting jump instructions or unconditional branch statements (UBSs) by calls to a fingerprint branch function (FBF) that computes the correct target address of the UBS {{as a function of}} the generated <b>fingerprint</b> and integrity <b>check.</b> If the program is tampered with, the <b>fingerprint</b> and integrity <b>checks</b> change and the target address will not be computed correctly. In this paper, we present an attack based on tracking stack pointer modifications to break the scheme and provide implementation details. The key element of the attack is to remove the <b>fingerprint</b> and integrity <b>check</b> generating code from the program after disassociating the target address from the fingerprint and integrity value. Using the debugging tools that give vast control to the attacker to track stack pointer operations, we perform both subtractive and watermark replacement attacks. The major steps in the attack are automated resulting in a fast and low-cost attack...|$|R
40|$|Two {{critical}} {{questions were}} put to the team: 1. Do shared or similar requirements and processes exist for submission of <b>fingerprint</b> <b>checks</b> to OPM/FBI across agencies that can be leveraged to streamline the enrollment process? 2. What standards must be supported by the enrollment stations to provide usable fingerprints to agencies? Summary of Results: The confusion around HPSD- 12 fingerprinting {{is a result of}} differing language around fingerprint processing and lack of adoption of the Type 14 submission in the Electronic Fingerprint Transmission Specification (EFTS) 1 by the personnel security community. The FBI does accept and process flat prints via Type 14 EFTS. OPM’s rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) estimate for updating internal systems to support receipt, processing, and relay of Type 14 prints is ~ 6 months. The central issue to be addressed is in fact the personnel security community has not yet approved acceptance of flat prints in background investigations (BI). The Personnel Security Working Group (PSWG) is scheduled to evaluate this issue during the June meeting. If the desire is to standardize acceptance and use of flat prints, this meeting is a critical juncture in th...|$|R

5000|$|Elected Attorney General in 1998 after 25 {{years as}} a {{legislator}} with a small close-knit staff, Lockyer took on an executive position that demanded both policy direction and managerial acumen. The Department of Justice, {{of which he was}} “chief executive officer”, had some 5,000 employees, 1200 of whom were attorneys handling a caseload of 100,000 lawsuits - the equivalent, in the private sector of the seventh largest law firm in America. Much of the Department’s effort was as a service agency for the staggering demands of California’s local law enforcement - 90,000 officers at 70,000 police terminals expecting split-second response from a state telecommunications network that received three million inquiries a day; background and <b>fingerprints</b> <b>checks</b> of a million annual applicants for positions as police officers, teachers and day-care providers, and “live scan” of another million and a half fingerprints taken during booking arrest, plus searches connected with 750,000 outstanding warrants for wanted suspects. This required Lockyer to radically restructure and reinvigorate his Department with high tech efficiencies and policy innovations to modernize the relationship between the Attorney General and the law enforcement community. Having grown up in the Berkeley 'Sixties atmosphere of anti-police rhetoric, Lockyer, now described by the press as the state's [...] "Top Cop", insisted on attending memorial services for more than 50 officers killed {{in the line of duty}} during his years in office.|$|R

5000|$|Until 2002 INS used {{a limited}} {{form of a}} Name Check for {{applicants}} for asylum, permanent resident status, and naturalization: the applicant's <b>fingerprints</b> were <b>checked</b> against existing criminal databases for records of arrests and criminal convictions, and UNI was searched for [...] "main files" [...] {{to determine if the}} applicant has been the target of an FBI investigation. In late 2002 INS discovered a case where an individual, who has been naturalized, was involved, as a secondary party, in a terrorism investigation. Subsequently, INS changed its policy and started requiring that maximally comprehensive FBI Name Check, including the search and detailed examination of all the [...] "reference files", be completed for all naturalization applicants before their applications are granted. Soon thereafter a similar policy was adopted for the adjustment of status and asylum applicants.|$|R
