2500|$|In 1853 Brahms went on {{a concert}} tour with Reményi. In late May the two visited the violinist and {{composer}} Joseph Joachim at Hanover. Brahms had earlier heard Joachim playing the solo part in Beethoven's violin concerto and been deeply impressed. Brahms played {{some of his own}} solo piano pieces for Joachim, who remembered fifty years later: [...] "Never <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> artist's life have I been more completely overwhelmed". This {{was the beginning of a}} friendship which was lifelong, albeit temporarily derailed when Brahms took the side of Joachim's wife in their divorce proceedings of 1883. Brahms also admired Joachim as a composer, and in 1856 they were to embark on a mutual training exercise to improve their skills in (in Brahms's words) [...] "double counterpoint, canons, fugues, preludes or whatever". Bozarth notes that [...] "products of Brahms's study of counterpoint and early music over the next few years included [...] "dance pieces, preludes and fugues for organ, and neo-Renaissance and neo-Baroque choral works." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his speech}} Scientific and Religious Truth (1974) while {{accepting}} the Romano Guardini Prize, Heisenberg affirmed:"In {{the history of}} science, ever since the famous trial of Galileo, it has repeatedly been claimed that scientific truth cannot be reconciled with the religious interpretation of the world. Although I am now convinced that scientific truth is unassailable in its own field, I have never found it possible to dismiss the content of religious thinking as simply part of an outmoded phase in the consciousness of mankind, a part we shall {{have to give up}} from now on. Thus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life I have repeatedly been compelled to ponder on the relationship of these two regions of thought, for I {{have never been able to}} doubt the reality of that to which they point." [...] (Heisenberg 1974, 213)"Where no guiding ideals are left to point the way, the scale of values disappears and with it the meaning of our deeds and sufferings, and at the end can lie only negation and despair.|$|E

CASE PRESENTATION: We present {{a case of a}} young carpet installer who was diagnosed with silicatosis of the lung. Review of occupational history revealed that the patient had been working as a carpet installer for approximately 15 years, since he was 15 years of age. The patient was exposed to talc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> his work. DISCUSSION: Exposure to talc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> carpet installation has not been reported as a possible cause of pneumoconiosis. In this article we review different causes of silicatosis and discuss chronic exposure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> carpet installation and development of pneumoconiosis. In addition, we also review the relevance of mycobacterial infection in cases of silicosis and silicatosis. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL OR PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE: Exposure to talc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> carpet installation should be added to conditions that can cause pneumoconioses, specifically silicatosis of the lung...|$|R
