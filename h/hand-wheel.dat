25|$|The United Electric Car Company of Preston built 15 {{double deck}} balcony cars for Sheffield Corporation Tramways in 1907. Initially {{numbered}} 258272 they had wooden seats for 59 passengers, and were {{mounted on a}} four-wheel Peckham P22 truck with two Metrovick 102DR 60hp motors operated by BTH B510 controllers. The braking systems consisted of a handbrake acting on all wheels, an electric brake for emergency use and a <b>hand-wheel</b> operated track brake. Between December 1924 and July 1927 they were rebuilt with a totally enclosed upper deck.|$|E
25|$|Sheffield 264 {{was built}} by the United Electric Car Company of Preston for Sheffield Corporation Tramways, one of a batch of fifteen double deck open balcony cars {{delivered}} in 1907. It was built with wooden seats for 54 passengers, mounted on a 4-wheel Peckham P22 truck with two Metrovick 102DR 60hp motors using BTH B510 controllers, with braking systems being a handbrake acting on all wheels, an electric brake for emergency use and a <b>hand-wheel</b> operated track brake. A 1926 rebuild included modification to a fully enclosed upper deck. Displaced to peak hour use in the 1930s, it was renumbered 342, but was not withdrawn until 1956.|$|E
25|$|South Shields 196 {{was built}} in 1935 at the Boavista Works of Oporto Tramways Company of Oporto (Porto), Portugal. A small 4-wheel single decker, one of a batch of 77 similar examples, {{it was based on}} an American design dating from 1909. Mounted on a Brill 21E truck, it has two GE(USA) 270A 55hp motors with licensee-built B54E controllers, and brakes using air-brake, {{emergency}} electric brake, and a handbrake operated by distinctive vertical <b>hand-wheels</b> {{to the right of the}} driver’s position. After rebuild, it has seating arranged longitudinally for 28 passengers.|$|R
60|$|We were wallowing {{through the}} China Seas in a dense fog, the horn blowing every two {{minutes for the}} benefit of the fishery craft that crowded the waterways. From the bridge the fo'c'sle was invisible; from the <b>hand-wheel</b> at the stern the captain's cabin. The fog held {{possession}} of everything--the pearly white fog. Once or twice when it tried to lift, we saw a glimpse of the oily sea, the flitting vision of a junk's sail spread in the vain hope of catching the breeze, or the buoys of a line of nets. Somewhere close to us lay the land, but it might have been the Kurile Islands for aught we knew. Very early in the morning there passed us, not a cable's-length away, but as unseen as the spirits of the dead, a steamer of the same line as ours. She howled melodiously in answer to our bellowing, and passed on.|$|E
60|$|Neither a bold nor {{a diversified}} country, I say again, and withal an untidy country, but {{pleasant}} enough to ride in, when the paved roads over the flats {{and through the}} hollows, are not too deep in black mud. A country so sparely inhabited, that I wonder where the peasants who till and sow and reap the ground, can possibly dwell, and also by what invisible balloons they are conveyed from their distant homes into the fields at sunrise and back again at sunset. The occasional few poor cottages and farms in this region, surely cannot afford shelter to the numbers necessary to the cultivation, albeit the work is done so very deliberately, that on one long harvest day I have seen, in twelve miles, about twice as many men and women (all told) reaping and binding. Yet have I seen more cattle, more sheep, more pigs, and all in better case, than where there is purer French spoken, and also better ricks--round swelling peg-top ricks, well thatched; not a shapeless brown heap, like the toast of a Giant's toast-and-water, pinned to the earth {{with one of the}} skewers out of his kitchen. A good custom they have about here, likewise, of prolonging the sloping tiled roof of farm or cottage, so that it overhangs three or four feet, carrying off the wet, and making a good drying-place wherein to hang up herbs, or implements, or what not. A better custom than the popular one of keeping the refuse-heap and puddle close before the house door: which, although I paint my dwelling never so brightly blue (and it cannot be too blue for me, hereabouts), will bring fever inside my door. Wonderful poultry of the French-Flemish country, why take the trouble to BE poultry? Why not stop short at eggs in the rising generation, and die out and have done with it? Parents of chickens have I seen this day, followed by their wretched young families, scratching nothing out of the mud with an air--tottering about on legs so scraggy and weak, that the valiant word drumsticks becomes a mockery when applied to them, and the crow of the lord and master has been a mere dejected case of croup. Carts have I seen, and other agricultural instruments, unwieldy, dislocated, monstrous. Poplar-trees by the thousand fringe the fields and fringe the end of the flat landscape, so that I feel, looking straight on before me, as if, when I pass the extremest fringe on the low horizon, I shall tumble over into space. Little whitewashed black holes of chapels, with barred doors and Flemish inscriptions, abound at roadside corners, and often they are garnished with a sheaf of wooden crosses, like children's swords; or, in their default, some hollow old tree with a saint roosting in it, is similarly decorated, or a pole with a very diminutive saint enshrined aloft in a sort of sacred pigeon-house. Not that we are deficient in such decoration in the town here, for, over at the church yonder, outside the building, is a scenic representation of the Crucifixion, built up with old bricks and stones, and made out with painted canvas and wooden figures: the whole surmounting the dusty skull of some holy personage (perhaps), shut up behind a little ashy iron grate, as if it were originally put there to be cooked, and the fire had long gone out. A windmilly country this, though the windmills are so damp and rickety, that they nearly knock themselves off their legs at every turn of their sails, and creak in loud complaint. A weaving country, too, for in the wayside cottages the loom goes wearily--rattle and click, rattle and click--and, looking in, I see the poor weaving peasant, man or woman, bending at the work, while the child, working too, turns a little <b>hand-wheel</b> put upon the ground to suit its height. An unconscionable monster, the loom in a small dwelling, asserting himself ungenerously as the bread-winner, straddling over the children's straw beds, cramping the family in space and air, and making himself generally objectionable and tyrannical. He is tributary, too, to ugly mills and factories and bleaching-grounds, rising out of the sluiced fields in an abrupt bare way, disdaining, like himself, to be ornamental or accommodating. Surrounded by these things, here I stood {{on the steps of the}} Hotel de Ville, persuaded to remain by the P. Salcy family, fifteen dramatic subjects strong.|$|E

5000|$|In 1980 was {{launched}} the advertising campaign named “Programma 80”, {{linked to the}} idea of transforming a manual valve into a thermostatic one, thanks to the substitution of the <b>hand-wheel</b> with an automatic head.|$|E
50|$|Located {{approximately}} amidships on the {{top deck}} was a cylindrical watertight aircraft hangar, 31 m long and 3.5 m in diameter. The outer access door could be opened hydraulically from within or manually from the outside by turning a large <b>hand-wheel</b> connected to a rack and spur gear. The door was made waterproof with a 51 mm rubber gasket.|$|E
50|$|Accurate {{measurements}} of the cetane number are rather difficult, as it requires burning the fuel in a rare diesel engine called a Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine, under standard test conditions. The operator of the CFR engine uses a <b>hand-wheel</b> to increase the compression ratio (and therefore the peak pressure within the cylinder) of the engine until the time between fuel injection and ignition is 2.407ms. The resulting cetane number is then calculated by determining which mixture of cetane (hexadecane) and isocetane (2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane) {{will result in the}} same ignition delay.|$|E

50|$|To {{negotiate}} sharp curves, {{both the}} first and fifth pairs of coupled wheels were flangeless. The cylinders were arranged outside the plate frame, while the Richardson balanced type slide valves were placed between the frames. The locomotive used saturated steam and was equipped with Allan straight link valve gear, which was reversed by <b>hand-wheel</b> and quick screw gear. Allan valve gear was chosen chiefly because it required less space than the more usual Stephenson lifting link gear and was simpler in construction. The trailing Bissel truck was of the Cartazzi type which allowed the axle some lateral movement.|$|E

50|$|At round same time, Gandhi read John Ruskin's book Unto This Last, which {{maintained}} that the life of manual labor was superior to all other ways of living. As he adopted this belief, Gandhi chose to abandon Western dress and habits, and he moved his family and staff to a Transvaal farm called the Phoenix, where he even gave renounced {{the use of an}} oil-powered engine and printed Indian Opinion by <b>hand-wheel,</b> and performed agriculture labor using old, manual farming equipment. He began to conceive of his public work as a mission to restore old Indian virtue and civilization, rather than fall prey to modern Western influence, which included electricity and technology.|$|E
5000|$|At {{one end of}} the bed (almost {{always the}} left, as the {{operator}} faces the lathe) is a headstock. The headstock contains high-precision spinning bearings. Rotating within the bearings is a horizontal axle, with an axis parallel to the bed, called the spindle. Spindles are often hollow and have exterior threads and/or an interior Morse taper on the [...] "inboard" [...] (i.e., facing to the right / towards the bed) by which work-holding accessories may be mounted to the spindle. Spindles may also have exterior threads and/or an interior taper at their [...] "outboard" [...] (i.e., facing away from the bed) end, and/or may have a <b>hand-wheel</b> or other accessory mechanism on their outboard end. Spindles are powered and impart motion to the workpiece.|$|E
5000|$|Medium {{and large}} ladles which are {{suspended}} from a crane have a bail which holds the ladle on shafts, called trunnions. To tilt the ladle a gearbox is used {{and this is}} typically a worm gear. The gear mechanism may be hand operated with a large wheel or may be operated by an electric motor or pneumatic motor. Powered rotation allows the ladle operator to be moved to a safe distance and control {{the rotation of the}} ladle via a pendant or radio remote control. Powered rotation also allows the ladle to have a number of rotation speeds which may be beneficial to the overall casting process. Powered rotation obviously also reduces the effort required by the ladle operator and allows high volumes of molten metal to be transferred and poured for long periods without operator fatigue. Where the ladle is fitted with a manually operated gearbox, the type of gearbox most commonly used is the worm and wheel design because in most practical circumstances, and when correctly maintained it can be considered as [...] "self-locking" [...] and doesn't need an internal friction brake to regulate the tilting speed of the ladle. Other types of gear system can be also be used but they have to be fitted with an additional braking system that can hold the ladle if the operator takes his hand off the <b>hand-wheel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Behind {{the driver}} was a {{bulkhead}} that formed another hull cross-member and separated him from the fighting compartment. The first tanks had a two-man turret, the gunner on {{the left of the}} gun and the commander acting also as the loader on the right. When three-man turrets were introduced, the commander sat {{to the rear of the}} turret. The turret was made up of a cast front and a cast rear riveted to the side plates which were of rolled steel. All tanks carried the radio in the turret rear. Early tanks used the Wireless set No. 11 with tannoy for the crew; later tanks had Wireless Set No. 19, which included crew communications with long and short range networks. Turret rotation was by electric motor controlled by the gunner, with a <b>hand-wheel</b> for manual backup. The restrictions that the two-man turret placed on the commander, made more so if they were a troop commander and responsible for directing the actions of two other tanks besides their own, were addressed by enlarging the turret for the Mark III so that a loader for the main armament could be carried. The turret ring diameter was not changed, so the extra space was found by moving the gun mounting forward in an extended front plate and increasing the bulge in the rear of the turret. This increased weight by half a ton on the 2.5 LT two-man turret.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{mathematical}} modelling of a front-wheel steer-by-wire (SBW) system is studied and a terminal {{sliding mode control}} scheme for the SBW system with uncertain dynamics is developed. It is shown that a front-wheel SBW system, from the <b>hand-wheel</b> to the steered front wheels, is equivalent to a second-order system. A terminal sliding mode controller can then be designed {{based on the information}} of the bounds of uncertain system dynamics, in the sense that not only a strong robustness with respect to system uncertainties and nonlinearities can be obtained, but also the front wheel steering angle can converge to the <b>hand-wheel</b> reference angle in a finite time. A simulation example is presented to verify the proposed control scheme...|$|E
40|$|A failed oxygen-charging valve of an {{aircraft}} was analyzed. Evidences suggest that fire was caused due to leakage in the valve. Analysis {{shows that the}} leakage was due to failure of the sealing in the valve. This had resulted in sudden movement of the spindle in the axial direction. The movement appears to have caused frictional heating at the threaded region of the spindle. The heat thus generated resulted in ignition of aluminium {{in the presence of}} high-pressure oxygen. Following this, the <b>hand-wheel</b> along with the spindle had popped out of the valve by fracturing the clamping nut...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a robust}} {{sliding mode control}} scheme for the Steer-by-Wire (SbW) systems with {{uncertain}} dynamics is developed. Based on the equivalent second-order model of an SbW system, a sliding mode controller can be designed based on the bound information of uncertain system parameters, uncertain self-aligning torque and uncertain torque pulsation disturbances, {{in the sense that}} not only the strong robustness with respect to large and nonlinear system uncertainties can be obtained, but also the front wheel steering angle can converge to the <b>hand-wheel</b> reference angle asymptotically. The experimental results are presented in support of the excellent performance and effectiveness of the proposed scheme...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a robust}} sliding mode {{learning}} control (SMLC) scheme is developed for steer-by-wire (SbW) systems. It is shown that an SbW system with uncertain system parameters and unknown external disturbance from {{the interactions between}} the tires and the variable road surface can be modeled as a second-order system. A sliding mode learning controller can then be designed to drive both the sliding variable and the tracking error between the steered front-wheel angle and the <b>hand-wheel</b> reference angle to asymptotically converge to zero. The proposed SMLC scheme exhibits many advantages over the existing schemes, including: 1) no information about vehicle parameter uncertainties and self-aligning torque variations is required for controller design; and 2) the control algorithm is capable of efficiently adjusting the closed-loop response based on the most recent history of the closed-loop stability and ensuring a robust steering performance. Both simulations and experiments are presented to show the excellent steering performance {{and the effectiveness of}} the proposed learning control methodology...|$|E
