25|$|Hypersecretion is {{more common}} than hyposecretion. Hyperprolactinemia is the most {{frequent}} abnormality of the anterior pituitary tumors, termed prolactinomas. Prolactinomas may disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis as prolactin tends to suppress the secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus and in turn decreases the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary, therefore disrupting the ovulatory cycle. Such hormonal changes may manifest as amenorrhea and infertility in females as well as impotence in males. Inappropriate lactation (<b>galactorrhoea)</b> is another important clinical sign of prolactinomas.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} English-language case reports found that serious adverse events associated with acupuncture are rare, but that acupuncture is not without risk. Between 2000 and 2011 the English-language literature from 25 countries and regions reported 294 adverse events. The majority of the reported adverse events were relatively minor, and the incidences were low. For example, a prospective survey of 34,000 acupuncture treatments found no serious adverse events and 43 minor ones, a rate of 1.3 per 1000 interventions. Another survey found there were 7.1% minor adverse events, of which 5 were serious, amid 97,733 acupuncture patients. The most common adverse effect observed was infection (e.g. mycobacterium), {{and the majority of}} infections were bacterial in nature, caused by skin contact at the needling site. Infection has also resulted from skin contact with unsterilized equipment or with dirty towels in an unhygienic clinical setting. Other adverse complications included five reported cases of spinal cord injuries (e.g. migrating broken needles or needling too deeply), four brain injuries, four peripheral nerve injuries, five heart injuries, seven other organ and tissue injuries, bilateral hand edema, epithelioid granuloma, pseudolymphoma, argyria, pustules, pancytopenia, and scarring due to hot-needle technique. Adverse reactions from acupuncture, which are unusual and uncommon in typical acupuncture practice, included syncope, <b>galactorrhoea,</b> bilateral nystagmus, pyoderma gangrenosum, hepatotoxicity, eruptive lichen planus, and spontaneous needle migration.|$|E

50|$|Other {{permanent}} {{side effects}} {{are similar to}} many other typical antipsychotics, namely extrapyramidal symptoms {{as a result of}} dopamine blockade in subcortical areas of the brain.

Zuclopenthixol is thought to be more sedating than the related flupentixol, though possibly less likely to induce extrapyramidal symptoms than other typical depots. As with other dopamine antagonists, zuclopenthixol may sometimes elevate prolactin levels; this may occasionally result in amenorrhoea or <b>galactorrhoea</b> in severe cases.

40|$|An 18 -year-old {{boy with}} delayed puberty {{was found to}} have a large {{prolactin}}oma.

40|$|Seventeen {{women and}} four men with <b>galactorrhoea</b> and {{associated}} hypogonadism {{have been treated}} with bromocriptine for 2 to 28 months.

Raised prolactin levels appear to block the actions of the gonadotrophins at a gonadal level rather than prevent their synthesis or release; lowering prolactin secretion with bromocriptine allows resumption of normal gonadal function.

40|$|The {{literature}} is reviewed and preliminary results of new studies are presented showing that treatment with classical antipsychotics, {{as well as}} risperidone, induces sexual dysfunctions in 30 - 60 % of the patients. These antipsychotics also frequently induce amenorrhoea and <b>galactorrhoea.</b> Although comparative studies are rare, {{it is likely that}} prolactin-sparing antipsychotics, as recently shown in a randomized trial of olanzapine versus risperidone, induce less sexual side effects. From these studies, it becomes apparent that prolactin elevation induced by classical antipsychotics and risperidone is probably a factor in inducing sexual dysfunctions, amenorrhoea and <b>galactorrhoea.</b> The role of other factors inducing sexual dysfunctions like sedation, alpha-blockade, testosterone, dopamine, and serotonin is discussed. Finally, it is concluded that sexual and hormonal effects of antipsychotics, although clearly important, are often neglected in research as in clinical practice. Lowering the dosage or switching to a prolactin-sparing antipsychotic often reduces sexual side effects, amenorrhoea, and <b>galactorrhoea.</b> (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Secondary {{amenorrhoea}} and <b>galactorrhoea</b> {{represent a}} common endocrine presentation. We report {{a case of}} an oestrogen-producing juvenile granulosa cell tumour (JGCT) of the ovary in a 16 -year-old post-pubertal woman with hyperprolactinaemia amenorrhoea and <b>galactorrhoea</b> which resolved following surgical resection of the tumour. This patient presented with a 9 -month history of secondary amenorrhoea and a 2 -month history of <b>galactorrhoea.</b> Elevated serum prolactin at 7081  mIU/l and suppressed gonadotropins (LH < 0. 1  U/l; FSH < 0. 1  U/l) were detected. Serum oestradiol was significantly elevated at 7442  pmol/l with undetectable β-human chorionic gonadotropin. MRI showed a bulky pituitary with no visible adenoma. MRI of the abdomen showed a 4. 8  cm mass arising from the right ovary with no evidence of metastatic disease. Serum inhibin B was elevated at 2735  ng/l. A right salpingo-oophorectomy was performed, and histology confirmed the diagnosis of a JGCT, stage International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics 1 A. Immunohistochemical staining for prolactin was negative. Post-operatively, oestrogen and prolactin levels were normalised, and she subsequently had a successful pregnancy. In summary, we present a case of an oestrogen-secreting JGCT with hyperprolactinaemia manifesting clinically with <b>galactorrhoea</b> and secondary amenorrhoea. We postulate that observed hyperprolactinaemia was caused by oestrogenic stimulation of pituitary lactotroph cells, a biochemical state analogous to pregnancy. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first report of hyperprolactinaemia as a result of excessive oestrogen production {{in the context of a}} JGCT. LEARNING POINTS: Hyperprolactinaemia with bilateral <b>galactorrhoea</b> and secondary amenorrhoea has a wide differential diagnosis and is not always caused by a prolactin secreting pituitary adenoma. Significantly elevated serum oestradiol levels in the range seen in this case, in the absence of pregnancy, are indicative of an oestrogen-secreting tumour. JGCTs are rare hormonally active ovarian neoplasms mostly secreting steroid hormones. Serum inhibin can be used as a granulosa cell-specific tumour marker. JGCTs have an excellent prognosis in the early stages of the disease...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{chronologically}} {{the evolution}} of raised prolactin levels as an entity in psychiatric patients.
