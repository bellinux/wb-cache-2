Henderson was not retained as a coach for 2008. Henderson has periodically been a special instructor in the Athletics' spring training camps. In 2010, he worked on base stealing (most notably with Rajai Davis and Coco Crisp) and outfield drills.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Bonilla {{hit one of}} {{the only}} 13 home runs ever hit into the upper deck of Three Rivers Stadium, and one of the six to the right-field side. Willie Stargell is the all-time leader in upper deck shots at the stadium, hitting four of the {{remaining}} five right-field blasts; Mark Whiten hit the other. The left-field upper deck had been reached by Jeff Bagwell twice, and Bob Robertson, Greg Luzinski, <b>Howard</b> <b>Johnson,</b> Glenallen Hill and Devon White (his home run struck the facade) once each.|$|E
5|$|Kinsler {{joined the}} 30–30 club, {{for the second}} time. He became the 12th player in major league history to have {{multiple}} 30–30 seasons.

Clayton Lambert has scored the most runs, with 39 runs {{at an average}} of 39.00; he also has the highest individual score for the country (39). Mark Johnson acted as wicket-keeper in all of U.S.'s fixtures and made one dismissal, catching Matthew Hayden for 23 off the bowling of <b>Howard</b> <b>Johnson.</b> Staple has claimed the most wickets in ODI matches for the U.S., having taken two, and holds the best bowling figures, with 2/76 (two wickets for seventy-six runs) against New Zealand.

5|$|MD291 crosses Chesterville Branch between MD298 and MD290 (Crumpton Road). MD291 and MD290 run {{concurrently}} east to {{a different}} section of Crumpton Road, on which MD290 splits north toward Chesterville. MD291 crosses Mills Branch as it approaches its indirect interchange with US301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway). The state highway connects with the southbound and northbound directions of the U.S. Highway via Edge Road (unsigned MD701A) and <b>Howard</b> <b>Johnson</b> Road (MD701), respectively, both of which meet MD291 at roundabouts. At this interchange, a park and ride lot {{is located on the}} west side of MD701. MD291 continues east into the town of Millington, through which the highway passes as Cypress Street. In the center of town, the highway intersects MD313 (Sassafras Street) and the Centreville Branch of the Northern Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad. MD291 crosses Cypress Branch to exit Millington along Cypress Road, which the route follows between the Chester River and the Millington Wildlife Management Area to the Delaware state line. The highway continues as DE6 (Millington Road) toward Smyrna.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Shelton House, a {{building}} across Elm Road, was purchased as a dormitory, and a classroom and office wing was dedicated in 1951. In 1955, after Howard Deering Johnson joined {{the board of}} trustees, the dormitory <b>Howard</b> <b>Johnson</b> Hall was built. From 1963, Briarcliff College rapidly expanded, constructing two dormitories, the fine arts and humanities building, the Woodward Science Building, and a 600-seat dining hall. In 1964, the college began offering the Bachelor of Arts and of Sciences degrees. The Center for Hudson Valley Archaeology was opened in 1964. Enrollment at the college jumped from around 300 to over 500 from 1960 to 1964; by 1967, enrollment was at 623, with 240 freshmen. During the Vietnam War, students protested US involvement, and Adkins and trustees resigned; James E. Stewart became president. In 1969, twelve students, led by student president Edie Cullen, stole the college mimeograph machines and gave nine demands to the college. The next day, around 50 students participated in a 48-hour sit-in at Dow Hall. Josiah Bunting III became president in 1973 and Pace University and New York Medical College of Valhalla began leasing campus buildings. The college had 350 students in 1977, and students enjoyed half-empty dormitory buildings.|$|E

Prior to Maryland's outlawing of capital punishment in 2013, he and Anthony Grandison were on death row for the murders of two clerks at the Warren House Motel (currently a <b>Howard</b> <b>Johnson)</b> in Pikesville in 1983.

25|$|Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest had {{proposed}} in 1865 {{before the end}} of the war to hire Black soldiers and freedmen in constructing a railroad for the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad Company, paying them with $1/day and land along the railway line. This proposal later gained the endorsements of Sherman, <b>Howard,</b> <b>Johnson,</b> and Arkansas Governor Isaac Murphy. Howard transported several hundred freedmen from Alabama to Arkansas for work on the line. He appointed Edward Ord to supervise the project and protect the freedmen from Forrest.|$|E
25|$|In 1963 {{the farm}} {{came up for}} sale and was bought by {{veterinarian}} Dr Carl Boyde. The farm was divided up and {{a small part of}} the farm had a small narrow gauge railway built on it called 'the Great Cockrow Railway', which survives to this day. A leading local historian, the late Bernard Pardoe, researched the history of the farm in detail (and apparently published his findings circa 1964) and journalist <b>Howard</b> <b>Johnson</b> also featured the history of the farm in an unidentified local newspaper in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Schiraldi {{returned}} to the mound for the Red Sox {{trying to keep the}} score even and atone for his blown save. After Knight walked, Mookie Wilson laid down a sacrifice bunt that Gedman threw wide of second in an attempt to get Knight, putting the winning run in scoring position with nobody out. This time, the Mets could not get a run in off Schiraldi as <b>Howard</b> <b>Johnson,</b> pinch hitting for Elster, struck out. Mazzilli and Dykstra then flied out for the remaining two outs, sending the game into extra innings.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{graduation}} from Brooklyn College in 1962, Feldman worked {{for six months}} as a substitute third-grade teacher in East Harlem. She continued to be active {{in the civil rights}} movement, working to desegregate <b>Howard</b> <b>Johnson</b> restaurants in Maryland. She participated in the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which was organized by Rustin and his associates. From 1963 to 1966, Feldman matriculated in a master's degree program in literature at New York University. While in graduate school, Feldman worked as a fourth-grade teacher at Public School 34 on the New York City's Lower East Side. She immediately joined the American Federation of Teachers, which had only one other member at the school. When New York City teachers won collective bargaining rights in 1960, she organized the entire school staff within a year. During this time, Feldman became an associate of Albert Shanker, then an organizer for the United Federation of Teachers.|$|E
500|$|Capel {{began his}} 1991 {{season with the}} Triple-A Tucson Toros; the Astros added Capel to their MLB roster on June 7. Two days later, against the New York Mets, Capel allowed the game-winning home run to <b>Howard</b> <b>Johnson</b> {{in the top of}} the 11th inning. Against the Mets on June 14, Capel, {{starting}} pitcher Pete Harnisch, and closer Jim Clancy combined for a four-hitter. His final MLB appearance came on August 14 against the San Diego Padres, when he pitched one inning in relief of Jim Corsi in a 4–1 loss. Capel said that pitching for Houston was [...] "the high point of my career". Over 25 games pitched, Capel finished the season with a 1–3 record and a 3.03 ERA.|$|E

[...] His last letter to his son was on 22 October 1957, when he said he was looking forward to being released on 10 November, having served one third of his sentence. A parole hearing had been scheduled for a few days before that date. He wrote that he and Peter had a date for a meal at the <b>Howard</b> <b>Johnson</b> restaurant near Peter's school.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the Turnpike's history, various plazas {{have been}} added or eliminated. [...] Two of the {{original}} plazas (at Laurel Hill and New Baltimore) were closed in the 1950s while the bypassing {{of what is now}} the Abandoned Turnpike led to the closure of the Cove Valley Plaza and opening of the Sideling Hill plaza, which serves both westbound and eastbound traffic. [...] In 1980, the plazas at Denver, Pleasant Valley and Mechanicsburg were sold to outside bidders and in 1983 the Path Valley plaza closed due to declining business, as it was only [...] east of the dual-access Sideling Hill plaza. [...] Throughout the decade, the former <b>Howard</b> <b>Johnson</b> restaurants were converted to a variety of fast food outlets and sit-down restaurants at some locations. In 1990 the Brandywine (now Peter J. Camiel) plaza was demolished and reconstructed, and in 2002 the Butler plaza closed {{to make room for the}} Warrendale Toll Plaza.|$|E
