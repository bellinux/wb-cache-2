25|$|Mk. VIII {{was also}} {{designed}} to use radio beacons for long-range homing on ground-based transponders. In {{this case the}} system {{was intended to be}} used with responders operating on the same frequency as the radar, as opposed to the Lucero which had its own frequencies. Since the dish had to be pointed downwards to see the transponder on the ground, the transponder sent out its response on a slightly different frequency so that it could be distinguished from the <b>ground</b> <b>return.</b>|$|E
500|$|Additionally, {{the sets}} {{demonstrated}} {{a serious problem}} with ground reflections. The broadcast antenna sent out the pulse over a very wide area covering the entire forward side of the aircraft. This meant {{that some of the}} broadcast energy struck the ground and reflected back to the receiver. The result was a solid line across the display at a distance equal to the aircraft's altitude, beyond which nothing could be seen. This was fine when the aircraft was flying at [...] or more and the <b>ground</b> <b>return</b> was at about the maximum useful range, but meant that interceptions carried out at lower altitudes offered increasingly shorter range.|$|E

30|$|LiDAR {{data was}} {{provided}} by the supplier classified as <b>ground</b> and non-ground <b>returns.</b> The classification was undertaken using Terra-Scan software with the algorithm described by Axelsson (2000). Manual identification of breaklines by skilled operators was also included to improve DEM quality. These classified <b>ground</b> <b>returns</b> were used to construct a DEM by connecting them into a Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN), and then linear interpolation onto a regular grid. As this software commonly underestimates the proportion of <b>ground</b> <b>returns</b> (as in general a false-negative will have a lesser effect on DEM accuracy than a false-positive), <b>ground</b> <b>returns</b> were deemed to be any return below - or less than 0.2  m above - this surface.|$|R
2500|$|The system {{normally}} {{switched the}} receiver to the beacon frequency, but the operator could also switch it {{to work on the}} normal transmitter frequency, at which point <b>ground</b> <b>returns</b> would appear.

500|$|Due to {{the wide}} pattern of the {{transmission}} antenna, some of the signal always hit the ground, reflecting some of it back at the aircraft to cause a <b>ground</b> <b>return.</b> This was so powerful that it was received {{on all of the}} antennas, even the upper vertical receiver which would otherwise be hidden from signals below it. As the shortest distance, and thus the strongest signal, was received from reflections directly below the aircraft, this caused a strong blip to appear across all the displays at the range of the fighter's altitude. The ground further in front of the aircraft also caused returns, but these were increasingly distant (see slant range) and only some of the signal was reflected back at the aircraft while an increasing portion was scattered forward and away. Ground returns at further distances were thus smaller, resulting in a roughly triangular series of lines at the top or right side of the displays, known as the [...] "Christmas tree effect", beyond which {{it was not possible to}} see targets.|$|E
500|$|To resolve {{questions}} about the blades, Pistorius was asked {{to take part in}} a series of scientific tests in November 2007 at the German Sport University Cologne with Professor of Biomechanics Peter Brüggemann and IAAF technical expert Elio Locatelli. After two days of tests, Brüggemann reported that Pistorius used about 25 percent less energy expenditure than non-disabled athletes once he achieved a given speed. The study also found that he showed major differences in sprint mechanics, with significantly different maximum vertical <b>ground</b> <b>return</b> forces, and that the positive work or returned energy was close to three times higher than that of a human ankle. The energy loss in the blade during stance phase when the foot was on the ground was measured as 9.3 percent, while that of normal ankle joint was measured at 42.4 percent, showing a difference of more than 30 percent. Brüggemann's analysis stated that the blades allowed lower energy consumption at the same speed, and that the energy loss in the blade is significantly less than in a human ankle at maximum speed. In December of that year, Brüggemann stated to Die Welt newspaper that Pistorius [...] "has considerable advantages over athletes without prosthetic limbs who were tested by us. It was more than just a few percentage points. I did not expect it to be so clear." [...] The study was published in 2008 in Sports Technology, but later researchers stated that the analysis [...] "did not take enough variables into consideration". Commentators have also argued that the IAAF study did not accurately determine whether Cheetahs confer a net advantage because measuring the net advantage or disadvantage conferred on an athlete using Cheetahs is not possible given current scientific knowledge. Second, the IAAF study may not have measured Pistorius’s performance against appropriate controls. IAAF used five non-disabled athletes, who run 400-meter races in similar times to Pistorius, as controls. However, because Pistorius was relatively new to the sport of running, he may not have trained enough to maximize his physical potential and reach his peak performance when the IAAF study was conducted. In March 2007, approximately 9 months before the IAAF study was conducted, Pistorius’s coach commented that Pistorius had not trained enough to achieve an upper body commensurate with the upper bodies of most elite sprinters. To obtain the most accurate understanding of how the prostheses affect Pistorius’s performance, he should be compared to athletes with similar physical potential. Consequently, the IAAF study may have been flawed because it compared Pistorius, who might have the physical potential to run faster than his current times, against athletes at their peak.|$|E

30|$|Despite the {{importance}} of Douglas-fir as a plantation crop, little research has investigated how variation in LiDAR pulse density affects the predictive precision of key structural metrics. The percentage of <b>ground</b> <b>returns</b> within stands of this species is typically {{lower than that of}} other widely planted species, such as Pinus radiata D. Don (Watt et al. [2013]), as Douglas-fir is typically planted at a high stand density and has a dense canopy.

40|$|Minimum {{detectable}} velocity (MDV) is {{a fundamental}} consideration for the design, implementation, and exploitation of ground moving-target indication (GMTI) radar imaging modes. All single-phase-center air-to-ground radars are characterized by an MDV, or a minimum radial velocity below which motion of a discrete nonstationary target is indistinguishable from the relative motion between the platform and the ground. Targets with radial velocities less than MDV are typically overwhelmed by endoclutter <b>ground</b> <b>returns,</b> and are thus not generally detectable. Targets with radial velocities greater than MDV typically produce distinct returns falling outside of the endoclutter <b>ground</b> <b>returns,</b> and are thus generally discernible using straightforward detection algorithms.
