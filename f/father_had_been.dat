5|$|He {{was born}} in Manhattan, New York City on February 22, 1910 to Anton Kaufman and Fannie Newman. His parents had married on March 14, 1909. His <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a {{reporter}} for the Berliner Morgen-Zeitung in Berlin, Germany before emigrating to the United States in 1905. Theodore's three brothers were Herbert, Julian, and Leonard.|$|E
5|$|Attalus was a {{young child}} when his father died, {{sometime}} before 241BC, after which he was adopted by Eumenes I, the incumbent dynast. Attalus' mother, Antiochis, {{was related to the}} Seleucid royal family (being a granddaughter of Seleucus I Nicator) with her marriage to Attalus' father likely arranged by Philetaerus to solidify his power. This would be consistent with the conjecture that Attalus' <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> Philetaerus' heir designate, but was succeeded by Eumenes, since Attalus I was too young when his father died.|$|E
5|$|Benn's <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> created Viscount Stansgate in 1942 when Winston Churchill {{increased}} the number of Labour peers to aid political work in the House of Lords; at this time, Benn's elder brother Michael was intending to enter the priesthood and had no objections to inheriting a peerage. However, Michael was later killed in an accident while on active service in the Second World War, and this left Benn as the heir to the peerage. He made several unsuccessful attempts to renounce the succession.|$|E

5|$|By 1990, Moffat {{had written}} two series of Press Gang, but the programme's high cost along with {{organisational}} changes at Central cast its future in doubt. As Moffat wondered {{what to do}} next and worried about his future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Moffat's <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a headteacher and Moffat himself had taught English before writing Press Gang, so his initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk, a series that eventually aired in 1997.|$|E
5|$|By September 1949, {{information}} from the Venona project indicated to GCHQ that Fuchs was a spy, but the British intelligence services were wary of indicating {{the source of their}} information. The Soviets had broken off contact with him in February. Fuchs may have been subsequently tipped off by Kim Philby. In October 1949, Fuchs approached Henry Arnold, the head of security at Harwell, with the news that his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> given a chair at the University of Leipzig in East Germany.|$|E
5|$|His <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a {{supporter}} of the Liberal Party, and Birkett had helped campaign for them during the 1906 general election. He had been invited to become the Liberal candidate for Cambridge in 1911, but he refused because he had no income; he did, however, help his employer George Cadbury, Jr. get elected as a Liberal Councillor in Birmingham and helped start a branch of the National League of Young Liberals in the city.|$|E

5|$|In 1139 Foliot {{was elected}} Abbot of Gloucester, blessed by the diocesan bishop on 11June 1139. The {{appointment}} {{had been pushed}} through by Foliot's relative, Miles of Gloucester, who was by then the Earl of Hereford. Foliot was well connected at court in other respects, for his probable <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> steward to David I, before David became King of Scotland. David was the uncle of both the Empress and Stephen's wife. Following his elevation to abbot Foliot recognised Stephen as king, although he seems until then to have supported Matilda.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the family's {{status as}} {{religious}} dissenters—not {{followers of the}} Church of England—attracted discrimination. Dissenters were not allowed into universities or the army, and were excluded by law from several professions. Her <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> suffering from tuberculosis and injuries he suffered from a fall off a cliff. When he died in November 1810 (aged 44), he left the family with significant debts and no savings, forcing them to apply for parish relief.|$|E
5|$|In {{economic}} terms, {{the late}} 1880s were {{a period of}} growth in the Orange Free State. Agriculture picked up, and the railway system became an important source of income as well. Reitz was instrumental in the modernisation of farming, propagating new techniques and a scientific approach to the prevention of plagues. Here Reitz showed himself the agriculturalist and model farmer his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> before him.|$|E

5|$|Moran played college {{football}} on an athletic scholarship at the College of the Holy Cross, where his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a football {{star in the}} early 1930s. Moran received his B.A. in economics in 1967. In 1970, he received a Master of Public Administration from the University of Pittsburgh. After college, Moran followed his father's footstep to become an amateur boxer, and during a campaign in 1992, {{he admitted that he}} had used marijuana during his early twenties. After a brief career as a stockbroker and graduate school attendance, Moran moved to Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|On {{many of his}} forays in Kentucky, Hines made special {{trips to}} see loved ones. Often it was to visit Nancy Sproule, his {{childhood}} sweetheart and future bride, in Brown's Lock, near Bowling Green. On other occasions he visited his parents in Lexington, Kentucky. In both places, Union spies attempted to capture Hines, but he always escaped, even after his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> captured {{and his mother was}} sick in bed.|$|E
5|$|Stuart {{was born}} in Ottawa, Ontario, the eldest son of William Stuart and Rachel Hodgson. He had two brothers, Alex and Bruce, and two sisters, Jessie and Lottio. Stuart was {{involved}} in sports from an early age. His <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a good curler and was once point skip of the Ottawa Curling Club, and both Hod and Bruce played hockey from a young age, often for the same teams. Stuart also played rugby and football, and played for the local professional football team, the Ottawa Rough Riders.|$|E

5|$|The {{hotel and}} the {{adjacent}} Blackstone Theatre were {{built on the}} site of Timothy Blackstone's mansion by John and Tracy Drake, sons of Blackstone's former business partner, the hotel magnate John Drake. John and Tracy Drake also developed the Drake Hotel. Their <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a director of Blackstone's Chicago and Alton Railroad. At the time of the opening, the hotel and theatre were located at the southern edge of the Chicago Theatre District at Michigan Avenue and Hubbard Court (which was first renamed 7th Street and later Balbo Drive).|$|E
5|$|The three Miller boys played Australian rules {{football}} {{in winter and}} cricket in summer. Their <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a successful local cricketer and taught the boys to play with an orthodox and classical technique, relying on a solid defence and concentration in the mould of Bill Ponsford. At the age of seven, Miller's family moved to Elsternwick, in Melbourne's south east. As a child, Miller was small for his age, which forced him to develop his technique rather than rely on power, something that held him in good stead for the future.|$|E
5|$|An inquest {{was held}} on 22 December; the jury could not {{determine}} whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and {{the outline of a}} new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> murdered by van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators.|$|E

5|$|Ann Marten {{was called}} to give {{evidence}} {{of the events of}} the day of Maria's disappearance and her later dreams. Thomas Marten then told the court how he had dug up his daughter, and Maria's 10-year-old brother George Marten revealed that he had seen Corder with a loaded pistol before the alleged murder and later had seen him walking from the barn with a pickaxe. Lea gave evidence concerning Corder's arrest and the objects found during the search of his house. The prosecution suggested that Corder had never wanted to marry Maria, but that her knowledge of some of his criminal dealings had given her a hold over him, and that his theft of the money sent by her child's <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a source of tension between them.|$|E
5|$|Biden's <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> very well-off {{earlier in}} his life, but {{suffered}} several business reversals {{by the time his}} son was born. For several years, the family had to live with Biden's maternal grandparents, the Finnegans. When the Scranton area went into economic decline during the 1950s, Biden's father could not find enough work. In 1953, the Biden family moved to an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, where they lived for a few years before moving to a house in Wilmington, Delaware. Joe Biden Sr. was then more successful as a used car salesman, and the family's circumstances were middle class.|$|E
5|$|Henry Ward Beecher became {{involved}} in many social issues of his day, most notably abolition. Though Beecher hated slavery as early as his seminary days, his views were generally more moderate than those of abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison, who advocated {{the breakup of the}} Union if it would also mean the end of slavery. A personal turning point for Beecher came in October 1848 when he learned of two escaped young female slaves who had been recaptured; their <b>father</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> offered the chance to ransom them from captivity, and appealed to Beecher to help raise funds. Beecher raised over two thousand dollars to secure the girls' freedom. On June 1, 1856, he held another mock slave auction to purchase the freedom of a young woman named Sarah.|$|E
