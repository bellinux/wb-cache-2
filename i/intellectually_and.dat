5|$|Pitfour was {{described}} {{as one of the}} greatest lawyers in the country. However, by the time he became a Senator of the College of Justice he was past his prime <b>intellectually</b> <b>and</b> thus did not make much of an impact in that role.

In his second year, he moved into a boarding house {{with a group of}} fellow law students who were to become close friends. They studied hard and enjoyed discussing philosophy and literature and telling bawdy tales. Hand's intellectual reputation proved less of a hindrance at law school than it had as an undergraduate. He was elected to the Pow-Wow Club, in which law students practiced their skills in moot courts. He was also chosen as an editor of the Harvard Law Review, although he resigned in 1894 because it took too much time from his studies.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} three {{aspects of the}} clustering strategy used by participants: the differences of clustering strategy between <b>intellectually</b> gifted <b>and</b> average children; the relationship between clustering strategy and recall performance in <b>intellectually</b> gifted <b>and</b> average children; and the differences in recall performance on collaborative recall task of <b>intellectually</b> gifted <b>and</b> average children. Thirty-eight <b>intellectually</b> gifted <b>and</b> 44 <b>intellectually</b> average children were recruited, and their collaborative and individual recall performances were tested. The results showed that intellectually gifted children had better clustering strategy than their peers when adjusted ratio of clustering scores were calculated (p <. 01); clustering strategy positively correlated with recall performance in intellectually average children (p <. 05), while no such correlation was found in intellectually gifted children (p =. 95); there was no collaborative inhibition in the gifted group (p =. 82). These findings partly resolve the conflicts in individual research and expand on the conclusions regarding collaborative memory. </p...|$|R

25|$|By 1981, Rajneesh's ashram hosted 30,000 {{visitors}} per year. Daily discourse audiences were by then predominantly European and American. Many observers {{noted that}} Rajneesh's lecture style {{changed in the}} late seventies, becoming less focused <b>intellectually</b> <b>and</b> featuring {{an increasing number of}} ethnic or dirty jokes intended to shock or amuse his audience. On 10 April 1981, having discoursed daily for nearly 15 years, Rajneesh entered a three-and-a-half-year period of self-imposed public silence, and satsangs—silent sitting with music and readings from spiritual works such as Khalil Gibran's The Prophet or the Isha Upanishad—replaced discourses. Around the same time, Ma Anand Sheela (Sheela Silverman) replaced Ma Yoga Laxmi as Rajneesh's secretary.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the {{restrictions}} placed upon the Jews as dhimmis, life under Muslim rule was one of great opportunity and Jews flourished as they did not under the Christian Visigoths. Many Jews came to Iberia, seen as a land of tolerance and opportunity, from the Christian and Muslim worlds. Following initial Arab victories, and especially {{with the establishment of}} Umayyad rule by Abd al-Rahman I in 755, the native Jewish community was joined by Jews from the rest of Europe, as well as from Arab lands, from Morocco to Babylon. Jewish communities were enriched culturally, <b>intellectually,</b> <b>and</b> religiously by the commingling of these diverse Jewish traditions.|$|E
25|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century, there was a growing {{tendency}} to make explicit distinction between the condemned and the reader. The condemned was increasingly relegated to his social sphere; he was not seen as a sinner, someone to whom the audience could relate to, but as someone who came from an <b>intellectually</b> <b>and</b> morally inferior class. By the 1760s it was common for the Ordinary to put emphasis on grammatical and orthographic errors of the condemned and to apologise for having as subjects such mean individuals. The Ordinary frequently made claims that the condemned were creatures deserving of pity, suggesting that common criminals lacked the moral and intellectual faculties of the readers and so emphasising the distance between the reader and the condemned.|$|E

25|$|The Book 2 of the Gesta Danorum by Saxo Grammaticus {{contains}} {{roughly the}} same information as the Chronicon Lethrense and the Annales Lundenses, i.e. that Ro (Hroðgar) and Helgo (Halga) were the son of Haldanus (Healfdene). When Haldanus died of old age, Ro took the land and Helgo the water. One day during his sea roving, Helgo arrived at Thurø, where he found and raped the young girl Thora, which resulted in Urse (Yrsa). When Helgo after many years returned to Thurø, Thora avenged her lost virginity by sending Urse to Helgo who, unknowingly raped his own daughter. This resulted in Roluo, who was a gifted man, both physically and <b>intellectually</b> <b>and</b> as brave as he was tall. After some time Helgo repelled a Swedish invasion, avenged Ro by killing the Swedish king Hothbrodd, and made the Swedes pay tribute. However, he committed suicide due to shame for his incestuous relationship with Urse. Roluo succeeded him.|$|E
