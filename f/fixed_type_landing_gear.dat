50|$|The Coyote is a high-wing strut-braced {{monoplane}} first {{flown in}} early 1991 and sold as kit for home building without an engine. With a steel tube fuselage and wooden wings {{it is designed}} to take an engine between 100 and 200 hp (74 to 149 kW) as long as it weighs less than 350 lb (159 kg). It has a <b>fixed</b> tailwheel <b>type</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> with a cabin for a pilot and passenger side-by-side, {{it is designed to}} land and take-off within 350 ft (107 m).|$|R
5000|$|Freiberger, {{a design}} {{engineer}} at General Motors and Rose-Hulman graduate flew Ron's 1 in November 1971, {{it was a}} braced low-wing monoplane with a welded steel-tube fuselage covered with Ceconite. The two-spar wing had vee-bracing struts and was made of wood with a Ceconite covering. Ron's 1 had a <b>fixed</b> tailwheel <b>type</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> with fairings over the main wheels, the pilot and passenger sat in tandem open cockpits. Powered by a [...] Lycoming O-320-B1B flat-four air-cooled engine driving a two-bladed metal fixed pitch propeller, Freiberger enclosed the engine in a radial-style cowling to give the aircraft a look of the early 1930s racing aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The A.S.39 was a high-wing, semi-cantilever, strut-braced (on {{the outer}} panels) {{monoplane}} with wooden wings and tail unit and an all-metal monocoque fuselage. It had a <b>fixed,</b> divided <b>type</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> and tailwheel. The observation aircraft had {{a crew of}} three: pilot, observer and radio operator. The A.S.39 had a unique crew configuration with the observer accommodated in the nose with clear-vision windows on three sides and the pilot's compartment raised to allow passage to the radio operator's compartment. Four small 130 hp Pobjoy Niagara V seven-cylinder air-cooled radial engines were mounted on the wings. This maximized propwash over the wing giving extra lift at low speed. The wings could be folded for storage when used on an aircraft carrier.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design that}} emerged, while superficially {{similar to the}} Wirraway, was really a new type that used some Wirraway {{components}} rather than a conversion. The only major components used in both types without alteration were the tail group and the <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> The fuselage was completely new, with a [...] hopper installed between the engine and the high-mounted single-seat cockpit. The Wirraway wing was substantially altered {{for use in the}} Ceres. The outer wing panels had slotted trailing-edge flaps and fixed leading edge slats, while the centre-section was substantially altered to accommodate the hopper, the higher weights of the Ceres, the different flaps (the Wirraway had split flaps) and the new <b>type's</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> with CAC Mustang main wheels as opposed to the Wirraway's retractable <b>gear</b> (the same <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> legs were used however). The increase in wingspan and wing area of the Ceres compared to the Wirraway was also incorporated in the centre-section, and the end result was an aircraft with much more docile stalling characteristics than those of the Wirraway. The engine was the same type, a Pratt & Whitney R-1340, but altered so that it was direct-drive instead of geared as on the Wirraway. The three-bladed variable-pitch propeller was also different, being of wider chord and smaller diameter compared to the Wirraway's to suit the Ceres' different operating regime and the direct-drive engine.|$|R

25|$|The {{aircraft}} uses retractable tricycle <b>type</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> by Messier-Dowty, {{with twin}} nosewheels {{and a single}} wheel on each main gear. A runway tailhook or a fairing for a brake parachute can be fitted under the tail, which can operate {{in conjunction with the}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear's</b> carbon brakes to shorten landing distances. A removable refueling probe can be attached in front of the cockpit, offset slightly to the right of centre.|$|R
50|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{also use}} trailing arms in their <b>landing</b> <b>gear,</b> with oleo struts for shock absorption. A trailing arm <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> results in smoother landings {{and a better}} ride when taxiing compared to other <b>types</b> of <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R

50|$|The ATOL is a {{two-seater}} amphibious aircraft with {{a composite}} wood structure; it has tail wheel <b>type</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> which is retractable for water operations. Special {{attention has been}} paid to the aircraft’s safe handling features. For example, the change in trim caused by changes in power has been directed correctly (the nose rises when the power is reduced). The canopy lifts backwards together with the instrument panel. This feature enables the aircraft to be accessed/exited through the front deck.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of this <b>type</b> of <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> design, Beechcraft did not design or offer wheel {{fairings}} for the fixed gear models. Several aftermarket manufacturers have designed and tested wheel fairings for Musketeers.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the results obtained from tests done by simulating the crash landing of a rotary wing unmanned air vehicle with a skid <b>type</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> The experimental and computational methods were used in the simulation tests. In the first portion of the test; namely with the experimental method, the impact loads induced by the simulated crash landing and the stresses, strains, deformations generated by these loads, were recorded by drop test apparatus. In the second portion of the test with the computational method, free falling of the skid <b>type</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> was modeled and crash landing test was simulated numerically by using ANSYS code. Experimental methods were applied on four skid <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> specimens with different shapes. Each of the test samples used in the following test was evolved because each sample was developed and redesigned based on the feedback results obtained from the former test. The first three test specimens were manufactured from 2024 T 3, 7075 T 6 and 6061 T 6 aluminum alloys respectively and all of them were curved in Π-form with a solid cross section. The last and fourth specimen was also manufac-tured from 6061 T 6 aluminum alloy and it was curved in a hollow semi-circle form (∩-form).

40|$|Wind-tunnel {{tests were}} {{performed}} to determine the drag of the front-wheel arrangements of several <b>types</b> of tricycle <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> One wheel was tested in arrangements to simulate both nonretracted and partially retracted <b>types.</b> The <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> were tested {{in conjunction with a}} fuselage, and the effects of wheel extension and longitudinal location were determined. The drag changed very little with either longitudinal location or wheel extension for the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> with the lowest drag; a completely faired <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> of the wheelspan, single-strut type. The drag of the trouser-type <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> increased considerably, however, with an increase in the wheel extension. The wheel of the unaired retractable <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> was at least one-half retracted into the fuselage before the drag became less than that of the best nonretracted <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> The drag per unit frontal area of the <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> of the present tests was about the same as that found for similar <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> in earlier tests...|$|R

50|$|The {{resulting}} {{aircraft was}} a single-bay, single-seat biplane with a fabric-covered, wooden framework and staggered, equal-span wings. The cross-axle <b>type</b> main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> {{was supported by}} V-struts attached to the lower fuselage longerons. The prototype and most production Pups were powered by the 80 hp (60 kW) Le Rhône 9C rotary engine.

5000|$|Rice states: The {{military}} {{definition of}} STOL (500 ft to a 50 ft obstacle) allows takeoff and landing {{in most of}} the areas in which limited war might be fought. In addition, the airplane was designed to use roads so that operation would even be possible in jungle areas where clearings are few and far between. As a result the wingspan was to be limited to twenty feet and a heavy trailing arm <b>type</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> with a tread of 6.5 ft was provided for operation from roads. Float operation was to be feasible......it is quite feasible to design the various components {{so that it can be}} disassembled easily and stored in a box that would fit in a 6×6 truck bed together with the equipment needed for re-assembly in the field.

40|$|The Class 1 {{configuration}} {{designs of}} a family of commuter aircraft are presented. The proposed aircraft will have a capacity of from 25 to 100 passengers. They are to have the following common features: (1) 2 aft fuselage mounted engines; (2) a low wing; (3) a T-tail type empennage; and (4) a tricycle <b>type</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> A family concept is introduced to achieve structural, systems and handling quality commonality throughout. Implementing commonality can substantially reduce manufacturing and production costs. By achieving common system designs, maintenance costs can be reduced by permitting airlines to stock a smaller inventory of spares. Therefore, the higher degree of commonality, the lower the direct operating and life cycle costs. The attempt to implement some of the commonality requirements has caused configuration design problems, i. e., the twin-body concept was introduced. Design data are compared to existing aircraft, and the extent of structural, systems and handling qualities achieved are reviewed...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of multibody systems with deformable components {{has been a}} subject of interest in many {{different fields such as}} machine design and aerospace. Traditional rigid-flexible systems often take a lot of computer resources to get accurate results. Accuracy and efficiency of computation have been the focus of this research in satisfying the coupling of rigid body and flex body. The method is based on modal analysis and linear theory of elastodynamics: reduced modal datum was used to describe the elastic deformation which was a linear approximate of the flexible part. Then rigid-flexible multibody system was built and the highly nonlinearity of the mass matrix caused by the limited rotation of the deformation part was approximated using the linear theory of elastodynamics. The above methods were used to establish the drop system of the leaf spring <b>type</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> of a small UAV. Comparisons of the drop test and simulation were applied.

50|$|A {{flying boat}} is a fixed-winged {{seaplane}} with a hull, {{allowing it to}} land on water, that usually has no <b>type</b> of <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> to allow operation on land. It differs from a floatplane as it uses a purpose-designed fuselage which can float, granting the aircraft buoyancy.

40|$|A {{new system}} has been {{developed}} at Pennsylvania State University for the prediction of landing-gear noise. The system is designed to handle the complex landing-gear geometry of current aircraft, {{as well as provide}} predictions for future aircraft landing-gear designs. The gear is represented by a collection of subassemblies and simple components that are modeled using acoustic elements. These acoustic elements are generic but generate noise representative of the physical components on <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> The method sums the noise radiation from each component of the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> in isolation, accounting for interference with adjacent components through an estimate of the local upstream and downstream flows and turbulence intensities. The acoustic calculations are made using the landing-gear-model-andacoustic-prediction code, which computes the sound pressure levels at specified observer locations.
