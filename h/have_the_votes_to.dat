25|$|In 1894, Boyce {{was elected}} to the Idaho state senate as a Populist from Shoshone County, Idaho. Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the {{establishment}} of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In {{one of the most dramatic}} speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist:Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in another part of the state….Why do you not produce some argument against it to show that it should not become a law? No, it is not necessary: you of the Republican party <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> kill the bill and that is all you desire. But remember these words: the laboring men of Idaho have asked you for bread and you give them a stone: we ask you for justice and you treat us with scorn, but the day is fast approaching when your action will be condemned by every man who has one drop of manly blood in his veins.|$|E
500|$|On September 28, Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Majority Leader, and Webster {{announced}} that they would run for Speaker of the House. McCarthy was considered the presumptive favorite in the race. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah and the Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, announced his candidacy on October 4, claiming that McCarthy did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> win the election. Several Republicans urged Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the running mate of Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election, to run for Speaker, but he declined, saying he is a [...] "policy guy" [...] with a preference to focus on his role as Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.|$|E
500|$|While Sam and Bruno are {{concerned}} about the loyalty of a powerful California union official (Sandoval), Toby and Josh are preparing for a meeting with the congressional opposition to re-negotiate the estate tax—or the [...] "death tax" [...] as the Republicans have labeled it—but are then surprised by a last-minute cancellation. It soon becomes clear that the Republicans are planning to repeal the estate tax altogether, and might <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> do so. An attempt to win over the black caucus, led by Congressman Mark Richardson (Barry), fails. At a loss over what to do, an initiative comes from unexpected quarters. The previously over-cautious political strategist, Doug Wegland, suggests the president responds by doing something he has never done before: veto the bill.|$|E
25|$|Dean {{was elected}} Chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) on February 12, 2005, after all his opponents {{dropped out of}} the race when it became {{apparent}} Dean <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> become Chair. Those opponents included former Congressman Martin Frost, former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb, former Congressman and 9/11 Commissioner Tim Roemer, and strategists Donnie Fowler, David Leland, and Simon Rosenberg.|$|R
50|$|The Senate {{amendment}} was sponsored as a compromise by committee Chairman Charles H. Percy (R, Ill.). It prevented a {{move by the}} committee's ranking Democrat, Claiborne Pell (R.I.), to extend the 1973 War Powers Resolution to Lebanon. On April 20, Pell said he would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> apply <b>the</b> resolution to U.S. Marines in Lebanon. The law limited presidential commitment of troops in hostile situations {{to a maximum of}} 90 days unless Congress specifically approved their use.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Ferrandino co-sponsored the Colorado Civil Unions Act, {{introducing}} {{it in the}} House. State Senator Pat Steadman originally introduced it in the Senate, {{where it}} passed with bipartisan support. The Colorado Civil Unions Act was an act to create legal recognition for same-sex and heterosexual couples in Colorado law. The act {{was killed in the}} Colorado House Judiciary Committee before it was able to reach a full House vote, where Ferrandino held it would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> pass.|$|R
500|$|On Day 4, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Big Brother Rave" [...] Have-Not competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were {{required}} to construct a series of pipes to spell out the word [...] "Have" [...] while neon [...] "Rave Juice" [...] flowed through the piping. If done correctly, the pipes would cause the juice to spill onto a wheel and cause it to spin; the last team {{to complete the task}} would be the Have-Nots for the week. The Brains clique lost the competition, meaning Chima, Michele, and Ronnie were the Have-Nots for the week. This greatly upset Chima, who stated on numerous occasions afterwards that she was debating walking from the game. Jessie took an immediate dislike to Laura, and hoped to put her up, though his clique members attempted to convince him that Lydia should be evicted that week. Due to Ronnie refusing to be nominated as a pawn, Chima later agreed to be nominated as a pawn. On Day 5, Jessie chose to nominate Chima and Lydia for eviction, with Lydia being his target for eviction. Worried they might not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> keep Chima, Jessie and Russell formed an alliance with Laura in attempt to get her to evict Lydia. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Russell, Natalie, and Jeff were selected to compete for the Power of Veto; Casey was selected to host. On Day 7, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Pop Goes the Veto!" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to pop [...] "pimples" [...] on an over-sized face, with various Scrabble tiles inside of them. The HouseGuests would collect tiles and attempt to spell a word with their collected tiles; the HouseGuest with the longest correctly spelled word would win the Power of Veto. Russell was the winner of the Power of Veto. Following the competition, Jeff engaged in numerous arguments with Russell and Natalie, causing a rift in their clique. In an attempt to save herself, Lydia attempted to convince Russell and Jessie to backdoor Braden that week by taking her off the block as a way to hurt Jeff. Russell later told Ronnie that this was the plan, with Ronnie telling Braden, Jeff, and Jordan about the plan. On Day 9, Russell chose to use the Power of Veto to remove Lydia from the block, with Braden being nominated in her place. Following Braden's nomination, Jordan and Laura began campaigning to get the votes for him to stay, and appeared to have themselves, Casey, Jeff, Michele, and Ronnie in agreement; Ronnie, however, was playing both sides and had no intention of keeping Braden in the game. On Day 12, Braden became the first HouseGuest to be evicted from the house when Jessie cast the tie-breaker vote in Chima's favor.|$|E
500|$|Following Braden's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Most Likely To..." [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests {{attempted}} to correctly guess which clique the viewers felt best fit a certain scenario; when a HouseGuest answered correctly they could eliminate one contestant from the competition, while an incorrect answer led to their own elimination. Ronnie was the winner. Following the eviction, those who evicted Chima began to speculate that Ronnie had been the HouseGuest to change his vote, though he continued to deny this and blamed Michele. Laura, {{being one of the}} first to realize that Ronnie had been the one to change his vote, attempted to turn the other HouseGuests against him, though Chima and Natalie later informed Ronnie of this. On Day 13, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Who Knows The Ugly Truth?" [...] luxury competition. For this competition, former winner Dan Gheesling returned to host the competition, in which the HouseGuests were required to answer questions based on what a member of the opposite sex felt. The male and female winners of the competition would win the opportunity to see the film The Ugly Truth, as well as choose the Have-Nots for the week. Casey and Chima are the winners of the prize, and choose the Popular clique, consisting of Jordan and Laura, to be the Have-Nots for the week. Later that day, Ronnie chose to nominate Jeff and Laura for eviction. Ronnie revealed his intentions to be backdooring Russell that week, though his alliance felt as though Russell would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> stay. Following a confrontation between Lydia and Russell, Lydia and Kevin approached Ronnie about backdooring Russell, and Natalie later debated turning on him as she felt he placed a target on her back. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Russell, Natalie, and Casey were selected to compete for the Power of Veto; Lydia was selected to host. On Day 14, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Big Brother Mint" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were given an amount of money and had two minutes to attempt to get that amount of money in change. HouseGuests competed in rounds, and the HouseGuests farthest away from the goal amount each round was eliminated; the last HouseGuest remaining would win the Power of Veto. Jeff was the winner of the Power of Veto. Despite initially planning on nominating Russell after the Power of Veto was used, Ronnie later began to see Laura as a bigger threat, feeling she was smart enough to figure out his plans. On Day 16, Jeff chose to use the Power of Veto to remove himself from the block, with Jordan being nominated in his place. When Ronnie lied and stated that Russell was campaigning to keep Laura in the game, he was confronted by the majority of the HouseGuests and accused of lying and playing both sides of the house. Following these events, Russell followed Ronnie around the house calling him names and taunting him for days afterwards. On Day 19, Laura became the second HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of eight to one.|$|E
2500|$|On January 21, 2000, Elián González's grandmothers, Mariela Quintana and Raquel Rodríguez, {{flew from}} Havana to the United States to seek their grandson's return to Cuba. While {{they were able}} to meet with the boy only once at the Miami Beach home of Barry University {{president}} Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, they journeyed to Washington and met with congressmen and Attorney General Janet Reno. After nine days of media coverage (during which Republican lawmakers acknowledged they did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> pass a bill to give González U.S. citizenship), they returned to Cuba to [...] "a hero's welcome".|$|E

5000|$|Klaus' {{chances to}} be reelected were boosted when Snítilý {{announced}} he would vote for Klaus prior to the session. [...] Surprisingly, in his address on 15 February 2008 before the joint session of parliament, Klaus stated he supported holding the presidential elections as public ballots and not as secret ballots as he demanded before. [...] Klaus also delivered a significantly more nationalistic and euroskeptical speech than the week previously. This was taken as an indication that he knew he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> win and no longer needed to moderate his feelings.|$|R

2500|$|After the {{agreement}} was signed, Podemos heavily criticized it and accused Rivera of [...] "selling himself out for free" [...] to Rajoy, claiming the PP was using C's to [...] "plug their holes". On the other hand, the PNV assured their stance would be that of a [...] "nonnegotiable no" [...] to Rajoy even after the expected Basque regional election scheduled for 25 September; whereas the PDC saw the signed accord as [...] "anti-Catalan" [...] and maintained its opposition, warning both PP and C's that they still lacked the votes to pass the investiture. Despite knowing he would not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> become Prime Minister unless the PSOE abstained, Rajoy stated he would [...] "keep trying" [...] even after his to-be-failed first investiture attempt.|$|E
5000|$|Puzder had [...] "come {{under intense}} fire from Democrats and liberal groups who {{accused him of}} mistreating his workers, {{opposing}} the minimum wage and supporting automation in the workplace" [...] as well as conservatives who criticized Puzder's [...] "employment of an undocumented immigrant as a housekeeper and his failure to pay taxes for her services." [...] On February 15, 2017, {{the eve of his}} scheduled confirmation hearing, Puzder withdrew his nomination, after [...] "it became clear to Republican Senate leaders that they did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> confirm him" [...] in the Senate confirmation..|$|E
5000|$|The Hastert Rule's {{introduction}} {{is widely}} credited to Speaker Dennis Hastert (1999-2007); however, Newt Gingrich, who directly preceded Hastert as Speaker (1995-1999), {{followed the same}} rule. The notion of the rule arose out of a debate in 2006 over whether Hastert should bring an immigration reform bill to the House floor after it had been passed by the Senate. “It was pretty obvious {{at that point that}} it didn’t <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> move it out, especially in the Judiciary Committee,” he said later. “It was pretty well stacked with people who weren’t willing to move.” ...|$|E
5000|$|When Tom {{reveals that}} the bill no longer <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> pass, Leslie begs the elderly and racist Councilman Milton (James Greene) for his <b>vote.</b> He agrees <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> [...] "yes", but when Leslie dodges his attempt to kiss her, he falls and injures himself, angering him back to a [...] "no" [...] vote. Jamm tells Leslie that he will vote [...] "yes" [...] if she {{switches}} offices with him, but she refuses. Meanwhile, Andy suggests to Ron that he play with Diane's two daughters to impress her; Diane later shows up at city hall and asks Ron out on a date.|$|R

Silber indicated that the team may be sold to buyers outside the Northern Virginia area, but he would prefer to keep it local if possible. Potential locations include the cities of Alexandria (former home of the team when they were the Alexandria Dukes) and Fredericksburg as well as Loudoun, Spotsylvania, and Fairfax counties. Maryland and Arlington County have been ruled out as possibilities, and Silber indicated it is unlikely the team will find another site in Prince William, either.|$|E
50|$|But {{with the}} post-9/11 {{economic}} downturn continuing, the City Council hesitated in approving the package. Mandarin Oriental officials had added a 8300 sq ft ballroom, a swimming pool, and a spa to the hotel's amenities. Although Mandarin Oriental obtained $85 million in financing from a banking syndicate and Mandarin International, Lano International, and Armada Hoffler Construction put in $19 million {{of their own}} money, the $46 million in TIF money {{was not enough to}} allow construction on the hotel to move forward. Mandarin Oriental officials came back to the city and asked for a $4 million property tax deferral, but the City Council did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> pass the legislation.|$|E

50|$|In {{its very}} first decision, the Court ruled on the {{constitutionality}} of four emergency executive decrees issued by the Chuan government {{to deal with the}} Asian financial crisis.
