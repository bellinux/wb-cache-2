500|$|During {{the second}} phase, after {{determining}} {{that the proposed}} weight of the monument was too great for the old foundation to safely bear, {{the thickness of the}} walls atop the unfinished stump was reduced and the foundation was strengthened by adding a large unreinforced concrete slab below the perimeter of the old foundation to increase the monument's load bearing area two and one half times. The slab was [...] thick, with an outer perimeter [...] square, an inner perimeter [...] square, with undisturbed loam inside the inner perimeter except for the water well. The area {{at the base of the}} second phase foundation is [...] The strengthened foundation (old foundation and concrete slab) has a total depth of [...] below the bottom of the lowest course of marble blocks (now below ground), and [...] below the entry lobby floor. Casey reported that nowhere did the load exceed [...] and did not exceed [...] near the outer perimeter. To properly distribute the load from the shaft to slab, about half by volume of the outer periphery of the old rubble foundation below its top step was removed. A continuous sloping unreinforced concrete buttress encircles what remains. The buttress is [...] square at its base, [...] square at its top, and [...] high. The perimeter of the original top step of the old rubble foundation rests on the larger top of the concrete buttress. Its slope (lower <b>external</b> <b>angle</b> from the vertical) is 49°. This buttress rests in a depression (triangular cross-section) on the top surface of the concrete slab. The slab was constructed by digging pairs of [...] wide drifts on opposite sides of the monument's center line to keep the monument properly balanced. The drifts were filled with unreinforced concrete with depressions or dowel stones on their sides to interlock the sections. An earthen terrace [...] wide with its top at the base of the walls and steep sides was constructed in 1880–81 over the reinforced foundation while the rest of the monument was being constructed. During 1887–88, a knoll was constructed around the terrace tapering out roughly [...] onto the surrounding terrain. This earthen terrace and knoll serves as an additional buttress for the foundation. The weight of the foundation is , including earth and gneiss rubble above the concrete foundation that is within its outer perimeter.|$|E
2500|$|Exterior angle – The {{exterior}} angle is the supplementary {{angle to the}} interior angle. Tracing around a convex n-gon, the angle [...] "turned" [...] at a corner is the exterior or <b>external</b> <b>angle.</b> Tracing {{all the way around}} the polygon makes one full turn, so the sum of the {{exterior angle}}s must be 360°. This argument can be generalized to concave simple polygons, if external angles that turn in the opposite direction are subtracted from the total turned. Tracing around an n-gon in general, the sum of the exterior angles (the total amount one rotates at the vertices) can be any integer multiple d of 360°, e.g. 720° for a pentagram and 0° for an angular [...] "eight" [...] or antiparallelogram, where d is the density or starriness of the polygon.

Right-hand internal tooth considerably larger than that on the left, which is often reduced to a mere ridge; internal basal rim thick, sometimes furrowed along its upper edge, but of variable thickness, sometimes not extending {{as far as the}} baso-carinal angle. Terga, sometimes equalling, sometimes only two-thirds of, the length of the scuta; in young specimens, the two occludent margins form a right-angle with each other; in older specimens they form less than a right-angle, and hence the portion of valve thus bounded is unusually protuberant. Carina, within deeply concave; exterior sides finely furrowed longitudinally, generally denticulated; valve only slightly narrowed in above the fork, of which the prongs diverge at an angle of 90°, or rather more, and are wider than the widest upper part of the valve; rim between the prongs reflexed; the heel or <b>external</b> <b>angle,</b> just above the fork, sometimes considerably prominent. I have seen only a single large specimen with its carina barbed. In half-grown specimens, (var. dilatata, Leach,) the carina is often strongly barbed, with the upper point much acuminated, the fork about twice as wide as the widest upper part, and the prongs diverging at rather more than a right-angle. In some specimens, especially very young ones, there are {{at the base of the}} carina, above the fork, some strong, downward-pointed, inwardly-hooked, calcareous teeth; such occur also in some specimens along the basal margins of the scuta, two of these hooked teeth under the umbones of the scuta being larger than the rest: specimens conspicuously thus characterised came from the Navigator Islands; in these, I may add, the acutely triangular primordial valves were quite plain.|$|E

A point z in the Julia set of a {{polynomial}} p {{is called}} biaccessible if two dynamic rays land at z; a point z in the Mandelbrot set is called biaccessible if two parameter rays land at z.

In this paper we give {{upper and lower bounds}} for the Hausdorff dimension of biac-cessible <b>external</b> <b>angles</b> of quadratic polynomials, both in the dynamical and param-eter space. We explicitly describe those quadratic polynomials where this dimension equals 1 (if and only if the Julia set is an interval), and when it equals 0, namely, at finite direct bifurcations from the polynomial z 2, as well as limit points thereof. We also show that the Hausdorff dimension of biaccessible dynamical angles de-pends in a Hölder sense on the parameter angle, and that this dimension, up to a factor log 2, equals the core entropy, i. e., the topological entropy of the dynamics of the Hubbard tree. 1...|$|R
