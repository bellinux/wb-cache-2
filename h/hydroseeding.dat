The use of surface applied organic amendments has been shown to reduce runoff and erosion and improve vegetative establishment on degraded soils such as those common to Georgia. In this study, four types of compost blankets, <b>hydroseed,</b> silt fence, and a bare soil (control) were applied in field test plots. Treatments were seeded with common bermuda grass. Simulated rainfall was applied at an average rate equivalent to a 50 yr one-hour storm event, and runoff samples were collected and analyzed for solids as well as runoff quantity. Three simulated rain events were conducted: immediately after treatment application, at vegetation establishment, and at vegetation maturity. In the short term, compost treatments produced significantly less runoff than the <b>hydroseeded</b> and bare soil plots. All treatments proved better than the control at reducing solids loss. Total solids loads were as much as 350 % greater from the <b>hydroseeded</b> plots compared to the composts during the first storm and as much as 36 times greater during the second storm.

In 1980, the north and south slope exposures were <b>hydroseeded</b> with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Plots were capped with topsoil prior to planting or left uncapped, and mulched with wheat straw after planting or left unmulched. Desert soil was classified as Palos Verdes-Sonoita Complex and Detrital-Sonoita Complex. Barley provided a quick, temporary cover and served as a mulch for later plantings. The number of seedlings established was the same for both exposures. Barley grew taller on the north slope possibly due to cooler temperatures. Barley growth was more vigorous on mulched areas. In 1981, the same north and south slopes were <b>hydroseeded</b> with Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees.), buffel grass (Pennisetum cilare (L.) Link), blue panicgrass (Panicum antidotale Retz.) and bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.). Prior to planting perennials, barley residue was incorporated into the slopes using a spike-tooth chain drag and a sheepfoot roller, or was left unincorporated. Incorporation of barley residue aided in its breakdown and helped prepare a good seedbed. The spike-tooth chain drag produced better growth than the sheepfoot roller, possibly due to excessive soil compaction with the sheepfoot roller. Capping tailing slopes with desert soil produced the most significant improvements in barley and perennial grass growth. Soil analyses of pure tailing and capped tailing revealed both were low in nitrogen and phosphorus. All plots were amended with these nutrients. Organic matter, although low for both samples, was higher in the capped tailing sample.

40|$|Abstract. In Korea, {{there are}} {{hundreds}} of abandoned and closed coal mines in the steep mountain valleys due to economic downturns in the mining industry. Enormous amounts of coal waste from these mines were dumped on the slopes, which cause sediment and acid mine drainage to be discharged directly into streams. A limestone slurry by-product (lime cake), which is produced during the manufacture of soda ash, was investigated for its potential use in reclaiming the coal waste. The lime cake is fine grained, has low hydraulic conductivities (10 - 8 to 10 - 9 cm sec- 1), high pH, high electrical conductivity due to the presence of CaO, MgO, and CaCl 2 as major components, and trace amounts of heavy metals. A field experiment was conducted; each plot was 20 x 5 m in size on a 56 % slope. Treatments included a control (waste only), lime (CaCO 3), and lime cake. The lime requirement (LR) of the coal waste to pH 7. 0 was determined, and treatments consisted of adding 100 %, 50 %, and 25 % of the LR. The lime cake and lime were applied in either a layer between the coal waste and topsoil or mixed into the topsoil and coal waste. Each plot was <b>hydroseeded</b> with grasses, and planted with trees. In each plot, soils, surface runoff, and subsurface water were collected and analyzed, and plant cover was measured. The lime cake treatments increased the pH of the coal waste from 3. 5 to 6, and neutralized the pH of the runoff and leachate of the coal waste from 4. 3 to 6. 7. Moreover, the surface cover of seeded species was significantly increased; sufficient acidity in the coal waste was neutralized in the 25 % LR plots to allow seed germination.

As {{a result of these}} studies, NDOW initiated a contract in 1986 with the Lake Mead Research Center (LMRC) to investigate means of improving habitat for game fish by introducing natural and/or artificial cover. During Phase I (1986 - 1987) of this contract, the shoreline of Lake Mead was surveyed for aquatic and terrestrial plant growth. Also during this time, submerged Christmas trees and Berkley Fish Habitat Modules were evaluated for their effectiveness in providing cover. Christmas trees appeared to provide cover for juvenile bluegill, a largemouth bass prey species. However, submerged trees lost their structure in about three years. Berkley Habitat Modules {{did not appear to be}} an effective form of cover. The National Park Service (NPS) asked that the introduction of artificial forms of cover not be continued until research was completed on the use of native plant material. Methods for aquatic and terrestrial plant introductions were determined during Phase II (1987 - 1988) of this contract. Other agencies and individuals involved in revegetation of reservoir inundation zones were contacted, and the literature was reviewed for plant material collecting procedures, planting guidelines, and site maintenance. A 2 ̆ 2 Plant Introduction Manual 2 ̆ 2 was compiled based on this information and was approved by the National Park Service for use in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. During the winter, dormant cuttings were taken of two woody species, Goodding 2 ̆ 7 s Willow and seepwillow baccharis (Salix gooddingii and Baccharis glutinosa) to be planted in the spring of 1988. In addition, collections were made of three emergent species (Typha angustifolia, Scirpus robustus, and Phragmites australis). Plant material was transported to the Nevada Division of Forestry (NDF) nursery where it was rooted and placed on pots for planting in May 1988. Sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus) tubers were introduced into small study plots in the spring of 1987. More tubers became established and were healthier in fertilized plots than in unfertilized plots. During Phase III (1988 - 1989) of this study, plant material was introduced into one cove in the lower basin and two coves in the upper basin of Lake Mead in April and May of 1988. Unpredicted low lake levels resulted in the loss of many plants. Survival rates of rooted material, however, were better than those of direct cuttings of woody plants. Site selection, particularly the soils of the site, appears to play a large part in survival. Seepwillow baccharis had the highest survival rates. In addition, greenhouse studies {{indicate that}} emergent plant tubers have some tolerance to dessication. Twelve hundred sago pondweed tubers were planted in April 1988 in one cove in the upper basin, and 1, 200 tubers were planted in a cove in the lower basin. Tubers had 100 percent germination success and provided 70 percent cover for fish by July 1988. Approximately 10, 000 sago pondweed tubers were planted in April 1989 in Waterbarge Cove in the lower basin. Tubers were planted in water depths ranging from very shallow to 12 - 15 meters deep. Germination and establishment of tubers were very good in depths less than 7 meters; however, little or no germination of tubers was noted at depths greater than 7 meters.

Reclamation involves restoring the landscape to approximate original contour, replacing the topsoil, and revegetating the site with trees and herbaceous species to a designated post-mining land use. Re-establishing an ecosystem of ecological and economic value as well as restoring soil quality on disturbed sites are the goals of land reclamation, and microbial properties of mine soils can be indicators of restoration success. Reforestation plots were constructed in 2007 using weathered brown sandstone or unweathered gray sandstone as topsoil substitutes to evaluate tree growth and soil properties at Arch Coal's Birch River mine in West Virginia, USA. All plots were planted with 12 hardwood tree species and subplots were hydroseeded with a herbaceous seed mix and fertilizer. After 6 years, the average tree volume index was nearly 10 times greater for trees grown in brown (3853 cm 3) compared to gray mine soils (407 cm 3).

By the usage of <b>hydroseeding</b> to protect the slope can speed the process of project and beautify the environment. Expecting a good protective effect on slope in the initial time of projecting depends much on the cohesive agent. CMC, paint, concrete are selected as the main materials of cohesive agent in this research and mix up nine different proportions of cohesive agent solution(cross mixture of CMC, CMC and paint, CMC and concrete resulting in the respective 0. 5 %, 1 %, 2 % proportions) and uses Bermuda grass, Bahia grass, Rhodes grass as the primary experimental plants to probe the cohesive agent affecting on protective effect of slopeland surface and initial growth of plants. Hoping to offer the reference in the <b>hydroseeding</b> project hereafter. The summary of initial researching conclusion is as follows: 1 With the raising concentration of the cohesive agent solution, the germination percentage of experimental plants becomes lower. In whatever concentration of cohesive agent solution, the germination percentage of Rhodes grass is the best while Bermuda grass and Bahia grass follow orderly. 2 Among the nine proportions of cohesive agent solution, the mixture of CMC and concrete possesses the best anti-erosion effect. Under the experimental condition if rainfall(110 mm/hr) the time needed to wash away the cohesive agent solution beneath the 1. 2 cm deep soil is almost 2. 5 times in comparison with the contrast one. 3 According to the siltation quantity measured by the observation stake in the testing area. The siltation quantity of the <b>hydroseeding</b> one is of small amounts whereas the contrast one collapses slightly. It shows that the cohesive agent truly functioned to protect the slope. 4 After probing into the <b>hydroseeding</b> in the field experimental area for eleven months, the effect is good by the over 80 % average cover rate.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} seed germination rate of some local plant species in two <b>hydroseeding</b> mulches containing different tackifier concentration, as well as to determine the optimal <b>hydroseeding</b> mulch media composition for germinating seeds. This study used seeds of 13 local plant species: two species of Cyperaceae (Cyperus brevifolius, C. javanicus), five species of Leguminosae (Cajanus cajan, Crotalaria pallida, Sesbania grandiflora, S. sesban, Tephrosia purpurea), and six species of Poaceae (Eleusine indica, Paspalum conjugatum, Sorghum timorense, S. bicolor, Sporobolus indicus, Themeda arundinaceae). Two <b>hydroseeding</b> mulch media with different tackifier composition were mixed with seeds of each species and then sowed in pots. Each treatment was repeated three times. Moistened cotton wool was used as control and comparative media for observing seed viability. Seed germination in mulch media was observed during 13 days. The results showed that only 8 of 13 species could be germinated: S. indicus, S. timorense, T. arundinaceae, C. cajan, C. pallida, S. grandiflora, S. sesban, and T. purpurea. The highest germination rate was shown by S. sesban (67 %) in M 2 medium and the lowest one was shown by T. arundinaceae (2 %) in both media. The fastest germination time was recorded for C. pallida and S. sesban seeds that germinated in 2 days after sowing (DAS) in both media, while S. timorense and T. arundinaceae seeds showed the lowest ones in 11 DAS. The fluid M 1 medium was optimal for seeds germination of S. sesban (50 %) and S. grandiflora (35 %), while the thicker M 2 medium was optimal for seeds germination of S. sesban (67 %) and S. timorense (50 %) in 13 DAS. The maximum germination rate was generally reached in 11 DAS...|$|E
40|$|Urban {{development}} {{will continue to}} increase in Texas because of population growth and urban sprawl. Despite the desire for urbanization and expansion of the economy, this growth increases the amount of construction, which, if not properly managed, can increase non-point source pollution and threaten surface water quality. Therefore, Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) has approved and promoted the use of compost as a stormwater best management practice (BMP) during highway construction. The objectives of this study were to construct and calibrate an indoor rainfall simulator and to determine the effectiveness of using compost rather than conventional <b>hydroseeding</b> or topsoil to reduce erosion from disturbed soils. Runoff rates, interrill erosion, and interrill erodibility were determined and compared across five compost treatments following TxDOT specifications for compost applied as an erosion control and two control treatments of topsoil (TS) and <b>hydroseeding</b> (HS) applied at 5 cm depth. The simulator produced 89 % uniformity using ten Veejet 80100 nozzles at a target rate of 100 mm h- 1. The surface runoff was collected after 5 minutes of rainfall (first flush) and during the last 30 minutes of rainfall (steady-state). The first flush mean runoff for GUC- 5 treatment was significantly higher than all other treatments. All other treatments; 50 % woodchips and 50 % compost blend (ECC- 1. 3, ECC- 5), and <b>hydroseeding</b> (HS) had significantly lower runoff and erosion rates compared to topsoil (TS) and compost manufactured topsoil (CMT) at first flush and steady-state. Furthermore, there were no performance differences between 1. 3 cm and 5 cm compost applications at first flush or steady-state. The results of this project indicate that particle size, soil moisture capabilities, and time at which rainfall is applied affect surface runoff. TxDOT specification of using ECC at 5 cm depth on a max of 3 : 1 slope should be reconsidered. An ECC application depth of 1. 3 cm was effective in reducing first flush runoff and interrill erosion rates...|$|E
40|$|While {{different}} kinds of compost have been tested for highway revegetation, sewage sludge has only been used for agricultural purposes. In this work, its application for helping vegetation establishment on roads embankments is studied. Testing areas measuring 4 ?? 5 m were constructed on a new highway embankment in an arid location. Several variables are analyzed: side slope (2); sludge dosage (4); vegetative species (4). Results are presented on growth, survival rate and germination of the plants; colonization of other species; cover crop for the plots; estimation of the erosion. The species planted manually showed satisfactory results although any variable was specially significant in this case. However, {{in relation to the}} species planted using <b>hydroseeding,</b> 2 : 1 side slope presented better results than 3 : 2 side slope. Using <b>hydroseeding,</b> the performance of different species was significantly different, thyme did not grow if sludge was not applied and the cover crop was higher in plots with 3 : 2 side slope than in plots with 2 : 1 side slope, essentially due to the presence of colonizing species. Finally, the costs of the proposed treatments are figured out, being concluded that, so much from the technical as the economic point of view, it is a viable proposal for sewage sludge management...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} study used sewage sludge from urban {{wastewater treatment plants}} to restore road embankments. The results {{have been used to}} propose a series of basic principles for the application of sludge in this context. In the study, six experimental plots (each composed of one cut slope and one fill slope) were set up on a highway located in the province of Jaen (Spain). The soil and vegetation in the plots were restored by a conventional <b>hydroseeding</b> process, with each plot receiving a different sludge dosage. A control plot did not receive any treatment at all, whereas another plot was hydroseeded, but without any sludge added to the slurry mix. In the plots, soil evolution was controlled from the moment that the embankment was created and hydroseeded until the present. As part of the soil monitoring process, agronomic parameters and the heavy metal content of the soil were analyzed in the laboratory. Another parameter of analysis was the vegetation cover, which was studied on the basis of on- site visual inspections and the rasterization of images with a view to calculate the percentage of vegetation cover on each plot. Results showed the effectiveness of sewage sludge as an organic complement in the restoration of road embankments. Its viability is enhanced {{by the fact that the}} sludge can be applied with the same methods used in public highway construction. The results also showed the optimal sludge dosage to be used in the slurry mix during the <b>hydroseeding</b> process...|$|E
