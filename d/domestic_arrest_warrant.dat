In {{the first part}} it {{describes}} historical development of the judicial cooperation leading {{to the adoption of}} the Framework Decision on the European <b>Arrest</b> <b>Warrant.</b> Then the European <b>arrest</b> <b>warrant</b> and extradition are compared and its key principles encapsulated.

40|$|The Framework {{decision}} on the European <b>Arrest</b> <b>Warrant</b> and the surrender procedures between Member States (2002 / 584 /SVV) adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 th June 2002 established the institute of the European <b>Arrest</b> <b>Warrant</b> between Member States which completely replaced existing extradition procedures between the Member States of the European Union. The implementation of the European <b>Arrest</b> <b>Warrant</b> was caused both by increasing cross-border criminality and terrorist attacks on September 11 th 2001 in the USA. The aim of its implementation was {{to increase the efficiency}} of the existing extradition procedures between EU Member States. The Bachelor thesis titled: "European <b>Arrest</b> <b>Warrant</b> [...] Comparison of the Extradition and the European Arrest Warrant" pursues a comparison of the European <b>Arrest</b> <b>Warrant</b> and classic extraditon procedures on the ground of comparing principles of both institutes. It emphasizes an important principle during the implementation of the European <b>Arrest</b> <b>Warrant</b> which is the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions. Furthermore, this thesis analyses benefits and shortcomings of the European <b>Arrest</b> <b>Warrant.</b> The shortcomings appear primarily in the practical implementation of the European <b>Arrest</b> <b>Warrant,</b> but its benefit is considerably bigger, so rightfully it is a breakthrough legal norm...|$|R
