50|$|Surveyor {{nuclease}} is {{a reasonably}} sensitive enzyme, producing detectable cleavage products from sequences representing {{only a small}} proportion of DNA in the population. It can detect a ratio of 1:32 heteroduplex to <b>homoduplex</b> for smaller PCR products (~0.6 bp), and 1:16 heteroduplex to <b>homoduplex</b> for longer PCR products (~2.3 kb). This property makes it possible to pool clinical samples in order to increase the heteroduplex formation and hence the sensitivity. This is also useful for detection of minor variants in a heterogeneous population (such as heterogeneous tumor). In the case of genome editing by CRISPR or other methods, this property can enhance detection of rare editing events in a population of cells prior to creation and testing of individual edited clones.|$|E
50|$|DNA-DNA {{hybridization}} {{is among}} a class of comparative techniques in molecular biology that produce distance data (versus character data) {{and that can be}} analyzed to produce phylogenetic reconstructions only using phenetic tree-building algorithms. In DNA-DNA hybridization, the percent similarity of DNA between two species is estimated by the reduction in hydrogen bonding between nucleotides of imperfectly complemented heteroduplex DNA (i.e., double stranded DNAs that are experimentally produced from single strands of two different species), compared with perfectly matched <b>homoduplex</b> DNA (both strands of DNA from the same species).|$|E
40|$|Jovin and {{co-workers}} {{have demonstrated that}} DNA strands containing guanine-adenine repeats generate a parallel-stranded <b>homoduplex.</b> Here we propose that the <b>homoduplex</b> is a dimer of the ordered single strand discovered by Fresco {{and co-workers}} at acid pH. The Fresco single strand is shown here to be stabilized in aqueous ethanol where adenine is not protonated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strands dimerize at higher salt concentrations without significantly changing their conformation, so that the dimerization is non-cooperative. Hence, the Jovin <b>homoduplex</b> can form through a non-cooperative dimerization of two cooperatively melting single strands. The available data indicate that the guanines stabilize the Fresco single strand whereas the adenines cause dimerization owing to their known intercalation or clustering tendency. The guanine-adenine repeat dimer {{seems to be a}} DNA analog of the leucine zipper causing dimerization of proteins...|$|E

The infectivity of these heteroduplexes was studied by using host-controlled modification and restriction to prevent infection by contaminating parental <b>homoduplexes.</b> Either strand was able to protect against degradation by restriction nucleases in vivo. A large proportion of progeny phage, which had been produced after infection with heteroduplexes containing noncomplementary base pairs at multiple loci, retained the genotype of one of the parental <b>homoduplexes.</b> The results indicate that conversion of heteroduplexes to <b>homoduplexes</b> in vivo by a DNA repair mechanism does not occur frequently. Molecules heterozygous for the c 17 or vir operator mutations were not infectious; it is suggested that these mutations involve multiple base pairs...|$|R
5000|$|These [...] "mismatches" [...] in the {{heteroduplex}} present {{are based}} on the polymorphism detection by DHPLC. Indeed, heteroduplexes thermally less stable than their corresponding <b>homoduplexes,</b> will be resolved by chromatography when subjected to a sufficiently high temperature. The consequence of this instability will be a mismatch of the two DNA strands in the region of polymorphism when DNA is heated to proper temperature. This mismatch will therefore decrease the interaction with the column and hence a reduced retention time compared to the <b>homoduplexes</b> in chromatographic separation.|$|R
40|$|Several fungal species, {{representatives of}} all broad groups like basidiomycetes, ascomycetes and phycomycetes, were {{examined}} for {{the nature of}} repeated DNA sequences by DNA:DNA reassociation studies using hydroxyapatite chromatography. All of the fungal species tested contained 10 - 20 % repeated DNA sequences. There are approximately 100 - 110 copies of repeated DNA sequences of approximately 4 × 107 daltons piece size of each. Repeated DNA sequence <b>homoduplexes</b> showed on average 5 °C difference of Te 50 (temperature at which 50 % duplexes dissociate) values from the corresponding <b>homoduplexes</b> of unfractionated whole DNA. It is suggested that a part of repetitive sequences in fungi constitutes mitochondrial DNA {{and a part of}} it constitutes nuclear DNA...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a simple and reliable method, PCR-PHFA (polymerase chain reaction dependent preferential <b>homoduplex</b> formation assay), for detection of single base substitutions within PCR amplicons. This technique is based upon strand competition during hybridization between a double labeled amplicon, prepared from biotin and DNP labeled primers, and an unlabeled amplicon. Under the precisely controlled temperature gradient, the preferential formation of a <b>homoduplex</b> over a heteroduplex occurs. After annealing, the identical sequence of the double labeled and unlabeled amplicon resulted in a low population of regenerated double labeled dsDNA due to strand exchange between them. Even when the two differed by only a single base substitution, double labeled molecule was regenerated efficiently because of preferential <b>homoduplex</b> formation. The regenerated double labeled molecule was captured onto a streptavidin coated microtiter plate and quantified enzymatically with a chromogenic substrate. The technique has been successfully applied in HLA-DPB 1 typing. Furthermore, we detected a mutated gene even {{in the presence of}} a large excess of the corresponding normal gene...|$|E
40|$|Heteroduplex DNA {{molecules}} {{were generated}} {{in which one}} of the two strands contained a 7 -base-pair (double-stranded) stem and 3 -base-pair (single-stranded) loop. The heteroduplexes and their corresponding <b>homoduplex</b> parental molecules, each of approximately 260 base pairs, were used for nucleosomes reconstitution. Protection from restriction endonuclease digestion was used to probe the structure of the resulting dinucleosomes. Although 50 % or more of the potential cleavage sites in the <b>homoduplex</b> DNAs and in the linear portion of the heteroduplex DNAs were inaccessible to nuclease digestion, no protection of the stem-loop structures was observed. The results imply that a stem-loop structure preferentially occupies the spacer region between nucleosomes, but if {{it is part of a}} core particle the stem-loop is always pointed "outward" in such a way as to be accessible to nuclease digestion...|$|E
40|$|We reevaluated {{the bias}} toward a 1 : 1 ratio of {{products}} in multitemplate PCR used in ecological studies {{and showed that}} the template reannealing at the annealing step would not cause the bias; however, the preferential <b>homoduplex</b> formation during temperature decrease from denaturation to annealing step would cause the bias...|$|E
50|$|The {{temperature}} gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) or {{temperature gradient}} capillary electrophoresis (TGCE) method {{is based on}} the principle that partially denatured DNA is more restricted and travels slower in a porous material such as a gel. This property allows for the separation of DNA by melting temperature. To adapt these methods for SNP detection, two fragments are used; the target DNA which contain the SNP polymorphic site being interrogated and an allele-specific DNA sequence, referred to as the normal DNA fragment. The normal fragment is identical to the target DNA except potentially at the SNP polymorphic site, which is unknown in the target DNA. The fragments are denatured and then reannealed. If the target DNA has the same allele as the normal fragment, <b>homoduplexes</b> will form that will have the same melting temperature. When run on the gel with a temperature gradient, only one band will appear. If the target DNA has a distinct allele, four products will form following the reannealing step; <b>homoduplexes</b> consisting of target DNA, <b>homoduplexes</b> consisting of normal DNA and two heterduplexes of each strand of target DNA hybridized with the normal DNA strand. These four products will have distinct melting temperatures and will appear as four bands in the denaturing gel.|$|R
50|$|So when heteroduplexes are {{partially}} denatured by heating, negative charges undergo partial relocation and {{the interaction}} force between DNA heteroduplexes and column decreases {{in comparison to the}} strength of interaction of <b>homoduplexes.</b> These will then less rapidly eluted by the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile, heteroduplexes compared to the first pass so that the front detector UV (Ultraviolet).|$|R
50|$|Denaturing high {{performance}} liquid chromatography (DHPLC) uses reversed-phase HPLC to interrogate SNPs. The key to DHPLC is the solid phase which has differential affinity for single and double-stranded DNA. In DHPLC, DNA fragments are denatured by heating and then allowed to reanneal. The melting {{temperature of the}} reannealed DNA fragments determines {{the length of time}} they are retained in the column. Using PCR, two fragments are generated; target DNA containing the SNP polymorphic site and an allele-specific DNA sequence, referred to as the normal DNA fragment. This normal fragment is identical to the target DNA except potentially at the SNP polymorphic site, which is unknown in the target DNA. The fragments are denatured and then allowed to gradually reanneal. The reannaled products are added to the DHPLC column. If the SNP allele in the target DNA matches the normal DNA fragment, only identical <b>homoduplexes</b> will form during the reannealing step. If the target DNA contains a different SNP allele than the normal DNA fragment, heteroduplexes of the target DNA and normal DNA containing a mismatched polymorphic site will form in addition to <b>homoduplexes.</b> The mismatched heteroduplexes will have a different melting temperature than the <b>homoduplexes</b> and will not be retained in the column as long. This generates a chromatograph pattern that is distinctive from the pattern that would be generated if the target DNA fragment and normal DNA fragments were identical. The eluted DNA is detected by UV absorption.|$|R
40|$|The GGA 9 -H {{molecules}} {{consisting of}} a double helical stretch followed by a single-stranded 3 '-terminal overhang of nine GGA sequence repeats exhibited a gel mobility-shifted band in a concentration-dependent manner, suggestive of the intermolecular complex formation. The position of the shifted band in a gel was almost identical {{to that of the}} Y-shaped dimer marker of the same molecular weight that had the two double-helices at one side. This suggests that GGA 9 -H dimerizes in a parallel orientation without the formation of four-stranded hairpin structure. Since the GGA 9 -H <b>homoduplex</b> was stably formed at pH 4, 7 and 9, the formation does not require protonation or deprotonation of the N 1 position of adenines. Neither does it require the N 7 group of guanines responsible for Hoogsteen base pairing from the methylation interference and modification studies. Modification of the N 7 group of guanines with dimethyl sulfate (DMS) did not inhibit the association and also the N 7 group in the <b>homoduplex</b> was not protected from DMS. On the other hand, the GAA 9 -H having the G to A base substitution did not show such an association with either GGA 9 -H or GAA 9 -H. These results suggest that the <b>homoduplex</b> formation may be due to G. G base pairing through non-Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds...|$|E
40|$|Rifampicin {{resistance}} in tuberculosis is gaining {{a foothold in}} the Philippines. It is therefore important to monitor the development and spread of rifampin resistant strains to enable clinicians to prescribe the appropriate anti-tubercular drugs. The discovery in recent years of the mutant rpoB gene representing rifampin resistance has {{led to the development of}} a molecular approach for the rapid detection of rifampin resistant isolates. This study utilizes this molecular approach, called the PCR-HDF and demonstrates, for the first time, the utility of such assay in the Philippines. Twelve clinical isolates positive for M. tuberculosis with variable susceptibility patterns by the conventional method were used. All rifampin susceptible isolates exhibited <b>homoduplex</b> DNA only. In contrast, all rifampin resistant isolates showed heteroduplex formation above the <b>homoduplex</b> DNA.

40|$|Competition between triplex {{formation}} with double-stranded DNA and oligonucleotide self-association {{was investigated}} in 23 mer GA and GT oligonucleotides containing d(GA) 5 or d(GT) 5 repeats. Whereas triplex formation with GT oligonucleotides was diminished when temperature increased from 4 to 37 degrees C, triplex formation with GA oligonucleotides was enhanced when temperature increased within the same range due {{to the presence of}} competing intermolecular GA oligonucleotide self-structure. This self-structure was determined to be a <b>homoduplex</b> stabilized by the internal GA repeats. UV spectroscopy of these homoduplexes demonstrated a single sharp transition with rapid kinetics (Tm = 38. 5 - 43. 5 degrees C over strand concentrations of 0. 5 - 4 microM, respectively, with transition enthalpy, delta H = - 89 +/- 7 kcal/mol) in 10 mM MgCl 2, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7. 0. <b>Homoduplex</b> formation was strongly stabilized by multivalent cations (spermine > Mg 2 + = Ca 2 +) and destabilized by low concentrations of monovalent cations (K+ = Li+ = Na+) in the presence of divalent cations. However, unlike GA or GT oligonucleotide-containing triplexes, the <b>homoduplex</b> formed {{even in the absence of}} multivalent cations, stabilized by only moderate concentrations of monovalent cations (Li+ > Na+ > K+). Through the development of multiple equilibrium states and the resulting depletion of free oligonucleotide, it was found that the presence of competing self-structure could decrease triplex formation under a variety of experimental conditions...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{strategy for}} detecting heterozygosity in genomic DNA {{has been developed}} based on preferential binding of Escherichia coli MutS protein to DNA molecules containing mismatched bases. The binding was detected by a gel mobility-shift assay. This approach was tested by using as a model the most commonly occurring mutations within the cystic fibrosis (CFTR) gene. Genomic DNA samples were amplified with 5 '-end-labeled primers that bracket {{the site of the}} delta F 508 3 -bp deletion in exon 10 of the CFTR gene. The renatured PCR products from homozygotes produced homoduplexes; the PCR products from heterozygotes produced heteroduplexes and <b>homoduplexes</b> (1 : 1). MutS protein bound more strongly to heteroduplexes that correspond to heterozygous carriers of delta F 508 and contain a CTT or a GAA loop in one of the strands than to <b>homoduplexes</b> corresponding to homozygotes. The ability of MutS protein to detect heteroduplexes in PCR-amplified DNA extended to fragments approximately 500 bp long. The method was also able to detect carriers of the point mutations in exon 11 of the CFTR gene by a preferential binding of MutS to single-base mismatches in PCR-amplified DNA...|$|R
40|$|Alternating d(GA) n DNA {{sequences}} form antiparallel stranded <b>homoduplexes</b> {{which are}} stabilized by {{the formation of}} G. A pairs. Three base pairings are known to occur between adenine and guanine: AH+ (anti). G(syn), A(anti). G(anti) and A(syn). G(anti). Protonation of the adenine residues {{is not involved in}} the stabilization of this structure, since it is observed at any pH value from 8. 3 to 4. 5; at pH < or = 4. 0 antiparallel stranded d(GA.

On the other hand, adenines in one strand adopt the anti conformation, with their N 7 position also free for reaction, while those of the opposite strand are in the syn conformation, with their N 7 position hydrogen bonded to the guanine N 1 group of the opposite strand.

40|$|Reverse {{transcription}} {{of human}} immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) is primed by tRNA(Lys 3), which forms an 18 base pair RNA <b>homoduplex</b> with its 3 ' terminus and the primer binding site (PBS) of the viral genome. Using an in vitro system mimicking initiation of minus strand DNA synthesis, we analyzed the mechanism by which HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) -associated ribonuclease H (RNase H) distinguishes between RNA/DNA and RNA/RNA (dsRNA). tRNA(Lys 3) was hybridized to a PBS-containing RNA template and extended by addition of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). In the presence of all four dNTPs, initial cleavage of the RNA template occurred immediately downstream of the tRNA-DNA junction, reflecting RNase H specificity for RNA in a RNA/DNA hybrid. However, {{in the absence of}} DNA synthesis, or limiting this by chain termination, the PBS was cleaved at a constant distance of 18 nucleotides upstream of the nascent primer 3 ' terminus. The position of cleavage remained in register with the position of DNA synthesis arrest, indicating that hydrolysis of <b>homoduplex</b> RNA is spatialy co-ordinated with DNA synthesis. Kinetic studies comparing cleavage rates of an analogous DNA primer/PBS heteroduplex and the tRNA(Lys 3) /PBS <b>homoduplex</b> showed that while the former is cleaved as rapidly as RT polymerizes, the latter proceeds 30 -fold slower. Although the RNase H domain hydrolyzes dsRNA when RT is artificially arrested, specificity for RNA/DNA hybrids is maintained when DNA is actively synthesized, since residency of the RNase H domain at a single base position is not long enough to allow significant cleavage on dsRNA...|$|E

Immobilized mismatch binding protein can bind DNA heteroduplexes while allowing <b>homoduplexes</b> {{to be washed}} away, thus enriching for rare mutations. We examined the potential use, for mutation enrichment, of a fusion protein of maltose binding protein and the mismatch binding protein TaqMutS (MBP-MutS). Unlabeled and fluorescent-labeled oligonucleotides, either perfectly complementary or with single nucleotide mismatches or deletions, were combined to form homo- or heteroduplexes that were then mixed at low ratios of hetero- to <b>homoduplexes</b> and enriched for heteroduplexes. Enrichment was observed using a capillary DNA sequencer. A single base deletion oligonucleotide was enriched {{by a factor of}} 29, and a mismatch oligonucleotide was enriched by a factor of 2. N- 1 oligonucleotide synthesis fragments were enriched more than were mismatches, suggesting that these deletion fragments may compete for MutS and impede enrichment of mismatches. Purification of oligonucleotides by high pressure liquid chromatography or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis failed to remove n- 1 fragments, thus overcoming this obstacle to enrichment of mismatch mutations may require alternative strategies, such as developing new purification methods or avoiding the use of synthetic oligonucleotides before enrichment. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Coamplification at lower denaturation temperature-PCR (COLD-PCR) is a new form of PCR that selectively amplifies mutation-containing templates based on the lower melting temperature of mutant <b>homoduplexes</b> versus wild type <b>homoduplexes.</b> We have developed a fast COLD-PCR and High-Resolution Melting (HRM) protocol to increase the sensitivity of KRAS mutation detection. The clinical applicability of COLD-PCR for KRAS mutation detection was assessed by analyzing 61 colorectal cancer specimens, for which KRAS mutation status has been evaluated by the FDA approved TheraScreen® KRAS mutation kit. The sensitivity was increased by 5 to 100 fold for melting temperature decreasing mutations when using COLD-PCR as compared to standard PCR. Mutations, undetectable by the TheraScreen® kit in clinical samples, were detected by COLD-PCR followed by HRM and verified by sequencing. Finally, we have observed a previously undescribed low prevalence synonymous mutation (KRAS c. 39 C>T, codon 13) in colorectal cancer specimens and in the peripheral blood from an unaffected individual. In conclusion, COLD-PCR combined with HRM is a simple way of increasing the sensitivity of KRAS mutation detection without adding to the complexity and cost of the experiments...|$|R
40|$|Using {{circular}} dichroism spectroscopy, UV {{absorption spectroscopy}} and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we studied conformational properties of guanine-rich DNA strands of the fragile X chromosome repeats d(GGC) n, d(GCG) n and d(CGG) n, with n = 2, 4, 8 and 16. These strands are generally {{considered in the}} literature to form guanine tetraplexes responsible for the repeat expansion. However, we show in this paper that the repeats are reluctant to form tetraplexes. At physiological concentrations of either Na+ or K+ ions, the hexamers and dodecamers associate to form <b>homoduplexes</b> and the longer repeats generate <b>homoduplexes</b> and hairpins. The tetraplexes are rarely observed being relatively most stable with d(GGC) n and least stable with d(GCG) n. The tetraplexes are exclusively formed {{in the presence of}} K+ ions, at salt concentrations higher than physiological, more easily at higher than physiological temperatures, and they arise with extremely long kinetics (even days). Moreover, the capability to form tetraplexes sharply diminishes with the oligonucleotide length. These facts make the concept of the tetraplex appearance in this motif in vivo very improbable. Rather, a hairpin of the fragile X repeats, whose stability increases with the repeat length, is the probable structure responsible for the repeat expansion in genomes...|$|R
40|$|CD {{spectroscopy}} and PAGE {{were used}} to cooperatively analyze melting conformers of DNA strands containing GA and TA dinucleotide repeats. The 20 mer (GA) 10 formed a <b>homoduplex</b> in neutral solutions containing physiological concentrations of salts and this <b>homoduplex</b> was not destabilized even in the terminal (GA) 3 hexamers of (GA) 3 (TA) 4 (GA) 3, although the central (TA) 4 portion of this oligonucleotide preserved the conformation adopted by (TA) 10. This observation demonstrates that homoduplexes of alternating GA and TA sequences can co-exist in a single DNA molecule. Another 20 mer, (GATA) 5, adopted as a whole either the AT duplex, like (TA) 10, or the GA duplex, like (GA) 10, and switched between them reversibly. The concentration of salt controlled the conformational switching. Hence, guanine and thymine share significant properties regarding complementarity to adenine, while the TA and GA sequences can stack {{in at least two}} mutually compatible ways within the DNA duplexes analyzed here. These properties extend our knowledge of non-canonical structures of DNA...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{carcinogens}} {{such as the}} aromatic amide 2 -acetylaminofluorene (AAF) {{are known}} to induce - 1 frameshift mutation hotspots at repetitive sequences. This mutagenesis pathway was suggested to involve slipped intermediates formed during replication. To investigate the stability and structure of such intermediates we have constructed DNA duplexes containing single AAF adducts within a run of three guanine residues. The strand complementary to that bearing the AAF adducts contained either the wild-type sequence (homoduplexes) or lacked one cytosine directly opposite the run of guanines containing the AAF adduct and thus modeled the putative slipped mutagenic intermediates (SMIs). The melting temperature of AAF-modified homoduplexes or the unmodified SMI was reduced by approximately 10 degrees C relative to the unmodified <b>homoduplex.</b> Surprisingly, AAF adducts stabilized the SMIs as evidenced {{by an increase in}} melting temperature to a level approaching that of the unmodified <b>homoduplex.</b> The chemical probes hydroxylamine and bromoacetaldehyde were strongly reactive toward cytosine residues opposite the adduct in AAF-modified homoduplexes, indicating adduct-induced denaturation. In contrast, no cytosine reactivities were observed in the AAF-modified SMIs, suggesting that the two cytosines were paired with unmodified guanines. Use of diethyl pyrocarbonate to probe the guanine residues showed that all three guanines in the unmodified SMI adopted a transient single-stranded state which was delocalized along the repetitive sequence. However, when an AAF adduct was present, reduced diethyl pyrocarbonate reactivity at guanines adjacent to the adduct in AAF-modified SMIs reflected localization of the bulge to the adducted base. Our results suggest that AAF exerts a local denaturing and destabilizing effect within the <b>homoduplex</b> which is alleviated by the formation of a bulge. The stabilization by the AAF adduct of the SMIs may contribute to the dramatic increase in - 1 frameshift mutation frequency induced by AAF adducts in repetitive sequences...|$|E
40|$|Temperature-Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (TGGE) was {{employed}} to determine the thermal stabilities of 28 DNA fragments, 373 bp long, with two adjacent mismatched base pairs, and eight DNAs with Watson– Crick base pairs at the same positions. Heteroduplex DNAs containing two adjacent mismatches were formed by melting and reannealing pairs of homo-logous 373 bp DNA fragments differing by two adjac-ent base pairs. Product DNAs were separated based on their thermal stability by parallel and perpendicular TGGE. The polyacrylamide gel contained 3. 36 M urea and 19. 2 % formamide to lower the DNA melting temperatures. The order of stability was determined in the sequence context d(CXYG) ·d(CY′X′G) where X·X′ and Y·Y ′ represent the mismatched or Watson–Crick base pairs. The identity of the mismatched bases and their stacking interactions influence DNA stability. Mobility transition melting temperatures (Tu) of the DNAs with adjacent mismatches were 1. 0 – 3. 6 C (± 0. 2 C) lower than the <b>homoduplex</b> DNA with the d(CCAG) ·d(CTGG) sequence. Two adjacent G·A pairs, d(CGAG) ·d(CGAG), created a more stable DNA than DNAs with Watson–Crick A·T pairs at the same sites. The d(GA) ·d(GA) sequence {{is estimated to be}} 0. 4 (± 30 %) kcal/mol more stable in free energy than d(AA) ·d(TT) base pairs. This result confirms the unusual stability of the d(GA) ·d(GA) sequence previ-ously observed in DNA oligomers. All other DNAs with adjacent mismatched base pairs were less stable than Watson–Crick <b>homoduplex</b> DNAs. Their relative stabi-lities followed an order expected from previous results on single mismatches. Two <b>homoduplex</b> DNAs with identical nearest neighbor sequences but different next-nearest neighbor sequences had a small but reproducible difference in Tu value.

40|$|Several {{techniques}} {{have recently been}} developed to detect single-base mismatches in DNA heteroduplexes that contain one strand of wild-type and one strand of mutated DNA. Here we tested the hypothesis that an appropriate system of mildly denaturing solvents can amplify the tendency of single-base mismatches to produce conformational changes, such as bends in the double helix, and thereby increase the differential migration of DNA heteroduplexes and <b>homoduplexes</b> during gel electrophoresis. The best separations of heteroduplexes and <b>homoduplexes</b> were obtained with a standard 6 % polyacrylamide gel polymerized in 10 % ethylene glycol/ 15 % formamide/Tris-taurine buffer. As predicted by the hypothesis of solvent-induced bends, when the concentration of either ethylene glycol or formamide was increased, the differential migration decreased. Also, single-base mismatches within 50 bp of {{one end of a}} heteroduplex did not produce differential migration. Sixty of 68 single-base mismatches in a series of PCR products were detected in some 59 different sequence contexts. The eight mismatches not detected were either within 50 bp of the nearest end of the PCR product or in isolated high-melting-temperature domains. Therefore, it was possible to predict in advance the end regions and sequence contexts in which mismatches may be difficult to detect. The procedure can be applied to any PCR products of 200 - 800 bp and requires no special equipment or preparation of samples...|$|R

Contrary to these expectations, transformations with the heteroduplex DNAs give as many doubly transformed progeny for unlinked marker pairs as do <b>homoduplex</b> DNAs. For a pair of markers that normally are weakly linked, the frequencies of cotransfer are actually greater than those observed for a mixture of two singly marked <b>homoduplex</b> DNAs. These results lead {{to the conclusion that the}} heteroduplex DNAs are acted upon by repair enzymes of recipient cells so that markers introduced in the trans configuration are frequently converted to the cis configuration, either before or during integration. The efficiency of this conversion suggests that the repair and integration processes may be intimately connected. It is also concluded that complete breakdown of one strand of donor heteroduplex DNA does not occur during DNA uptake by recipient cells...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli methyl-directed {{mismatch}} repair is initiated by MutS-, MutL-, and ATP-dependent activation of MutH endonuclease, which cleaves at d(GATC) {{sites in the}} vicinity of a mismatch. This reaction provides an efficient method for detection of mismatches in heteroduplexes produced by hybridization of genetically distinct sequences after PCR amplification. Multiple examples of transition and transversion mutations, as well as one, two, and three nucleotide insertion/deletion mutants, have been detected in PCR heteroduplexes ranging in size from 400 bp to 2. 5 kb. Background cleavage of <b>homoduplexes</b> is largely due to polymerase errors that occur during amplification, and the MutHLS reaction provides an estimate of the incidence of mutant sequences that arise during PCR...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{molecules}} {{derived from}} three alleles of the HLA-DRB 3 locus and differing {{from each other}} at several nucleotide sites were denatured and cross-hybridized. Each allelic combination was found to generate a pair of heteroduplexes of different mobility. Their retardation as compared to <b>homoduplexes</b> was proportional {{to the number of}} mismatches. In each heteroduplexes pair the component possessing the highest number of Pyr-Pyr oppositions was the most retarded. The results are those predicted by a theoretical model implying a correlation between base-pair opening and bending of the DNA double helix. These observations introduce a new HLA typing method at the genomic level and indicate an experimental approach to the analysis of the superhelical DNA conformation as related to different types of base oppositions...|$|R
40|$|Genomic DNAs of equine {{herpesvirus}} type 1 (EHV- 1), EHV- 2 (equine cytomegalovirus), and EHV- 3 {{were examined}} by reassociation kinetic and thermal denaturation analyses {{to determine the}} extent and degree of homology among the three viral DNAs. Results of reassociation analyses indicated a limited homology among the three EHV genomes. Homologous DNA sequences equivalent to 1. 8 to 3. 7 megadaltons between EHV- 1 and equine cytomegalovirus, 7. 6 to 8. 2 megadaltons between EHV- 1 and EHV- 3, and 1. 3 to 1. 9 megadaltons between equine cytomegalovirus and EHV- 3 were detected. Examination by thermal denaturation of the DNA <b>homoduplexes</b> and heteroduplexes formed during reassociation revealed a high degree of base pairing within the duplexes, suggesting that closely related sequences may be conserved among the genomes of EHV...|$|R
