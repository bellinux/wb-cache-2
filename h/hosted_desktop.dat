50|$|For <b>Hosted</b> <b>Desktop</b> vendors utilising VMware and Microsoft technology, {{charges are}} {{normally}} monthly {{with a basic}} charge applied for each user of a <b>Hosted</b> <b>Desktop</b> and then additional charges for an office productivity suite, additional data storage and extra applications. Some vendors wrap a suite {{of the most common}} applications into product sets to simplify still further.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Hosted</b> <b>Desktop</b> based {{environment}} will generally migrate user authentication, file & print services and application delivery and data storage to the cloud making it accessible via secure connections from any internet enabled location. The relatively small bandwidth requirements for a <b>Hosted</b> <b>Desktop</b> means that between 5 & 10 people can connect {{and work on}} a standard xDSL broadband, whilst a single user can operate quite effectively on a 3G mobile data connection.|$|E
50|$|The {{centralized}} {{nature of}} <b>hosted</b> <b>desktops</b> can overcome common issues with mobile working, {{delivery of a}} common infrastructure across physical sites, disaster recovery, cost control and scaling up/down in timely fashion.|$|R

50|$|Workspace Virtualization runs {{directly}} on the client computer hardware whereas Desktop Virtualization in many cases runs on a remote computer somewhere over a corporate LAN/WAN or over the Internet (called <b>Hosted</b> <b>Desktop</b> Virtualization).|$|E
5000|$|Remote desktop {{virtualization}} {{can also}} be provided via a cloud computing similar to that provided using a {{software as a service}} model. This approach is usually referred to as Cloud <b>Hosted</b> Virtual <b>Desktops.</b> Cloud <b>Hosted</b> Virtual <b>Desktops</b> are divided into two technologies: (1) Managed VDI, which is based on VDI technology provided as an outsourced managed service, and (2) Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS), which provides a higher level of automation and real multi-tenancy reducing the cost of the technology. The DaaS provider typically takes full responsibility for hosting and maintaining the compute, storage, and access infrastructure, as well as applications and application software licenses needed to provide the desktop service in return for a fixed monthly fee. For example, VMware's Horizon DaaS, based on VMware's acquisition of Desktone, is a monthly fixed rate DaaS service. [...] Amazon's WorkSpaces on Amazon EC2 is also a monthly fixed rate, as are the <b>hosted</b> <b>desktops</b> of smaller providers like Dizzion, Inc. and V2 Cloud.|$|R
50|$|Leostream {{develops}} a vendor-neutral connection broker, which is software that maps end users to computing resources, such as <b>desktops,</b> that are <b>hosted</b> in a data center. A connection broker integrates end-user access points, including thin clients, laptops and Web browsers, with back-end systems <b>hosting</b> <b>desktops</b> and applications. It also integrates all other data center systems {{required for a}} virtual desktop infrastructure, including security, authentication, and load balancing systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{move towards}} <b>hosted</b> <b>desktops,</b> of which Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) is a subset, is {{predicted}} by Gartner {{to account for}} 49 million business desktops by 2013 equal to more than 40 percent of the worldwide professional PC market. The development of applications by service providers such as Google and Microsoft have accelerated this process, as has the evolution of new licensing schemes which allow fee-paying based on a subscription rather than on purchase.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hosted</b> <b>desktop</b> {{services}} {{can be a}} comparatively simple method for applying outsourcing principles within a business although care is warranted in ensuring service provider quality to ensure compliance, data security and data protection standards meet requirements.|$|E
50|$|NX technology, {{developed}} by NoMachine, and {{commonly known as}} 'NX' is a proprietary computer program that provides <b>hosted</b> <b>desktop</b> and remote access. It consists of a suite of NoMachine software products related to desktop virtualization and application delivery for server-based computing and cloud-based environments.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, NoMachine {{announced}} the NX Terminal Server project for application delivery and <b>hosted</b> <b>desktop</b> software for Unix and Linux-based applications. NoMachine since extended its NX product {{to support a}} number of operating systems and features. In 2013, NoMachine entered the competitive remote desktop access market by introducing free software for both Mac and Windows (in addition to the one already available for Linux) for individuals.|$|E
50|$|Moving virtualized {{desktops}} {{into the}} cloud creates <b>hosted</b> virtual <b>desktops</b> (HVDs), {{in which the}} desktop images are centrally managed and maintained by a specialist hosting firm. Benefits include scalability and the reduction of capital expenditure, which {{is replaced by a}} monthly operational cost.|$|R
40|$|Virtualization in {{computing}} {{has progressed}} {{to an extent}} where desktops can be virtualized and accessed from anywhere. The server hosted model has already surpassed 1 % market share of the worldwide professional PC market, with estimates indicating {{that this is a}} rapidly growing area. This paper investigates the adequacy of current digital forensic procedures on <b>hosted</b> virtual <b>desktops</b> (HVDs) as there {{does not appear to be}} specific methods of locating and extracting evidences from this infrastructure. A <b>hosted</b> virtual <b>desktop</b> deployed in private clouds was simulated to reflect two different computer crime scenarios. It was found that current digital forensic procedures may not be adequate for locating and extracting evidence, since the infrastructure introduces complications such as persistent/non-persisted disk modes and segregating data in a multi-tenant environment...|$|R
5000|$|HP ConvergedSystem 100 for <b>Hosted</b> <b>Desktops</b> {{works with}} the {{software-defined}} HP Moonshot m700 microserver systems and includes software, hardware and services to provide users with an environment for running Virtual desktops.Each user gets a dedicated CPU and GPU, which removes {{the need for a}} hypervisor. [...] According to published reports, the Moonshot server consumes up to 63 percent less power than competing systems, and can lower the total cost of ownership by 44 percent compared to standard desktop computer systems. Built as a joint effort with AMD and Citrix, the system is reported to provide graphics that are six times faster than those of competing products. [...] Client virtualization also provides a way for users to more securely access business applications and data from mobile devices.|$|R
50|$|A <b>hosted</b> <b>desktop</b> is {{a product}} set within the larger cloud-computing sphere {{generally}} delivered {{using a combination of}} technologies including hardware virtualization and some form of remote connection software, Citrix XenApp or Microsoft Remote Desktop Services being two of the most common. Processing takes place within the provider's datacentre environment with traffic between the datacentre and the client being primarily : display updates, mouse movements and keyboard activity (additional traffic will be generated by audio & print jobs).|$|E
50|$|A <b>Hosted</b> <b>Desktop</b> {{commonly}} {{involves a}} browser-based {{connection to a}} desktop environment which includes an office productivity suite alongside other desktop applications. The desktop is hosted, run, delivered and supported from a central location, usually a secure data center with high-quality and resilient connections to the Internet/cloud. Cloud Desktop is a term often {{used to refer to}} a container of a collection of virtual objects, software, hardware, configurations etc., residing on the cloud, used by a client to interact with remote services and perform computer related tasks.|$|E
50|$|Hosted Desktops {{are most}} often based on a Windows Server 2008 utilising Remote Desktop Services, often with an {{additional}} management layer from Vendors like Citrix Systems or Parallels Workstation to make personalisation easier. Licensing {{for this type of}} <b>Hosted</b> <b>Desktop</b> is provided by the Microsoft Service Provider License Agreement (SPLA), a special type of End-user license agreement. The user rents the appropriate licenses as part of the monthly fee paid to the service provider and receives automatic upgrade rights to the latest version of the software as part of the agreement.|$|E

40|$|The LittleDog robot is a 12 degree-of-freedom quadruped {{developed}} by Boston Dynamics and selected {{for use in}} the DARPA Learning Locomotion program, in which machine learning is applied to develop controllers capable of navigating rocky terrain. Presently, it is typically constrained to operate within wireless range of a <b>host</b> <b>desktop</b> computer and within a fixed workspace surrounded by a motion capture system that globally localizes the robot and specially marked terrain boards without the use of onboard sensing. In this thesis, we explore a variety of strategies for expanding the capabilities of this platform in the theme of relaxing these operational constraints and with the goal of allowing operation in arbitrary locations outside of the fixed workspace and without a host computer. Towards this end, we start by addressing the straightforward technical issue of physical independence by demonstrating a viable onboard controller {{in the form of a}} compact single-board computer. Next, we attempt to resolve the lack of onboard sensing through computer visio...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} laboratory {{is often}} a homogeneous environment, in which the computers have the same hardware and software settings. Conducting system tests in this laboratory environment is quite challenging, as the laboratory {{is supposed to be}} shared with regular classes. This manuscript details the use of desktop virtualization to deploy dynamically a virtual cluster for testing and ad-hoc purposes. The virtual cluster can support an environment completely different from the physical environment and provide application isolation essential for separating the testing environment from the regular class activities. Windows 7 OS was running in the <b>host</b> <b>desktops,</b> and VMware Workstation was employed as the desktop virtualization manager. The deployed virtual cluster comprised virtual desktops installed with Ubuntu Desktop Linux OS. Lightweight applications using VMware VIX library and shell scripts were developed and employed to manage job submission to the virtual cluster. Evaluations on the virtual cluster’s deployment show that we can leverage on desktop virtualization to quickly and dynamically deploy a testing environment while exploiting the underutilized compute resources...|$|R

50|$|All Enterprise {{versions}} of NoMachine's NX protocol allow client connections to <b>hosts</b> via Remote <b>Desktop</b> Protocol (for Windows Remote Desktop Services sessions) and remote Virtual Network Computing sessions (most modern {{general-purpose operating system}} platforms) as well as XDM.|$|R
5000|$|Desktop {{virtualization}} is {{an umbrella}} term that describes software technologies that improve portability, manageability and compatibility {{of a personal}} computer's desktop environment by separating part {{or all of the}} desktop environment and associated applications from the physical client device that is used to access it. A common implementation of this approach is to <b>host</b> multiple <b>desktop</b> operating system instances on a server hardware platform running a hypervisor. This is generally referred to as [...] "virtual desktop infrastructure" [...] (VDI).|$|R
50|$|Thin clients {{occur as}} {{components}} of a broader computing infrastructure, where many clients share their computations with a server or server farm. The server-side infrastructure makes use of cloud computing software such as application virtualization, <b>hosted</b> shared <b>desktop</b> (HSD) or desktop virtualization (VDI). This combination forms what is known today as a cloud based system where desktop resources are centralized into one or more data centers. The benefits of centralization are hardware resource optimization, reduced software maintenance, and improved security.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We present VSPIN, a {{framework}} for developing incremental code update mechanisms to support efficient repro-gramming of wireless sensor networks. The presentation empha-sizes the supporting framework rather than the reprogramming mechanisms themselves. Concretely, VSPIN provides a modular testing platform on a <b>host</b> <b>desktop</b> system to plug-in and evaluate various incremental code update algorithms. The framework supports Avrdude, {{among the most popular}} programming tools for AVR microcontrollers. VSPIN consists of a virtual serial port device driver which executes in Linux kernel space, a user space component, and a corresponding boot loader which executes on the sensing (microcontroller) core. The framework is tailored for AVR microcontrollers, which support in-system reprogramming of on-chip flash memory through a serial interface (SPI or UART). On the host side, VSPIN can function with wireless communication devices (802. 11 b/g/n or 802. 15. 4), or wired communication devices which expose a serial device interface on the Linux platform (RS- 232 or USB). We describe the overall architecture and detail the individual components of VSPIN. The development of VSPIN is the first such attempt to facilitate ease of development, testing, and use of incremental code update algorithms for efficient network reprogramming. Index Terms—Wireless sensor networks, reprogramming, in-cremental code update, software tools, Linux-based frameworks. I...|$|R

5000|$|Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, or VDI, was {{initially}} branded by VMware. The term VDI has enjoyed broader usage, however, and {{has come to}} be known as a synonym for server-hosted <b>desktop</b> virtualization, or <b>Hosted</b> Virtual <b>Desktops</b> (Gartner). A typical VDI architecture replaces end users desktops by deploying each desktop on a virtual machine, running on a server in the data center. Users access a view of their desktop via a thin client or other access device, using a vendor-specific protocol.VMware Mirage differs fundamentally from this type of architecture in the following ways: ...|$|R
40|$|Continued {{improvements}} in network bandwidth, cost, and ubiquitous access are enabling service providers to <b>host</b> <b>desktop</b> computing environments {{to address the}} complexity, cost, and mobility limitations of today’s personal computing infrastructure. However, distributed denial of service attacks can deny use of such services to users. We present A²M, a secure and attack-resilient <b>desktop</b> computing <b>hosting</b> infrastructure. A²M combines a stateless and secure communication protocol, a single-hop Indirection-based network (IBN) and a remote display architecture to provide mobile users with continuous access to their desktop computing sessions. Our architecture protects both the hosting infrastructure and the client’s connections against {{a wide range of}} service disruption attacks. Unlike any other DoS protection system, A²M takes advantage of its low-latency remote display mechanisms and asymmetric traffic characteristics by using multipath routing to send a small number of replicas of each packet transmitted from client to server. This packet replication through different paths, diversifies the client-server communication, boosting system resiliency and reducing end-toend latency. Our analysis and experimental results on PlanetLab demonstrate that A²M significantly increases the hosting infrastructure’s attack resilience even for wireless scenarios. Using conservative ISP bandwidth data, we show that we can protect against attacks involving thousands (150, 000) attackers, while providing good performance for multimedia and web applications and basic GUI interactions even when up to 30 % and 50 %, respectively, of indirection nodes become unresponsive...|$|R
5000|$|Another way of {{classifying}} softmodems is {{by means}} of their communication interface with the <b>host</b> computer: on <b>desktop</b> systems the most common option is an internal PCI or ISA expansion card, which can be easily be told apart from an internal [...] "hardware" [...] modem by the significantly reduced size and component count.|$|R
