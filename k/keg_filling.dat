40|$|A typical large brewery {{could have}} a keg fleet size {{in the order of}} {{hundreds}} of thousands. For some breweries, the asset value of this fleet is second only to fixed plant. The annual rate of attrition within the fleet can range from 5 % to 20 %, a sizable figure in dollar terms with a stainless steel keg costing around USD 100. There is a business case for a keg asset management system that can help to reduce the annual rate of attrition and supply chain cycle time. Established solutions such as bar codes and RFID tags are costly as they require a modification to every keg. The feasibility of a machine vision tracking system based on the optical character recognition (OCR) of the keg's existing serial number is explored. With prospective implementation in the <b>keg</b> <b>filling</b> line, a process is proposed which is based on neural network OCR. A recognition rate of 97 % was achieved for kegs with non-occluded serial numbers with realistic scope for further improvement...|$|E

50|$|American David Bushnell {{developed}} the first American naval mine for use against the British in the American War of Independence. It was a watertight <b>keg</b> <b>filled</b> with gunpowder that was floated toward the enemy, detonated by a sparking mechanism if it struck a ship. It was {{used on the}} Delaware River as a drift mine.|$|R
6000|$|... "The <b>kegs</b> are <b>filled</b> with gunpowder," [...] said Spider, {{in a low}} tone, {{turning to}} those aft. And so it proved when the last had been opened.|$|R
6000|$|To Billy's surprise, however, {{instead of}} seizing the <b>keg</b> and <b>filling</b> out a bumper, he said sternly--"See here," [...] {{and tossed the}} wine-glass into the sea. [...] "Now lad," [...] he added, in a quiet voice, [...] "throw that keg after it." ...|$|R
5000|$|As a chief, Baw Beese was {{reported}} as holding to a strict code of justice. The execution {{of his daughter}} Winona, for having murdered her husband Negnaska, was not prevented despite his status. Winona's husband had pledged his rifle to Mr Aaron B. Goodwin of Fremont, Indiana {{for the use of}} a keg. The Indians had the <b>keg</b> <b>filled</b> at Nichols' store in Jamestown, but Mr Nichols ended up taking everything they had. The brave sold his squaw's pony, to raise money to retrieve the rifle. Winona owned the pony outright, either as a gift from her father or having bought it with her own money. She killed Negnaska in anger for selling what was hers. Winona was held by the tribe for a few hours, until her husband's nearest relative arrived to execute her in the like manner she had killed - [...] with a stab to the heart.|$|R
5000|$|Surplus cornelius kegs {{which are}} {{obsolete}} from the soft-drink industry {{have been adopted}} by home brewers as an efficient alternative to bottling, as the kegs are easier to fill, clean and maintain than industry-standard beer kegs. They {{are one of the}} most versatile systems for the home-brewer. [...] In addition to this, most home brewers must bottle their beer by hand, which is a tedious chore for a large batch held in a single <b>keg</b> <b>fill.</b> The most common size of Cornelius keg holds five US gallons (19 l) which conveniently matches the size of a typical batch of home brewed beer. [...] This means that rather than saving, cleaning, and filling approximately fifty bottles, the brewer only needs to <b>fill</b> one <b>keg.</b> Despite the simplified bottling procedure, refrigerating kegged beer generally requires a kegerator, which can be difficult to set up and maintain, for dispensing. Furthermore, individual bottles have superior portability when compared to a cornelius keg.|$|R
5|$|Florida's {{involvement}} in the U.S. Civil War was limited compared to other Confederate states because it had {{a fraction of the}} populations of states that had been developed. Florida provided materials to the Confederacy by way of steamboats on the St. Johns, although the river and the Atlantic coasts were blockaded by the U.S. Navy. One action in Florida's role in the Civil War was the sinking of the USS Columbine, a Union paddle steamer used for patrolling the St. Johns to keep materials from reaching the Confederate Army. In 1864, near Palatka, Confederate forces under the command of Capt. John Jackson Dickison captured, burned, and sank the USS Columbine, making her perhaps the only ship commandeered by the Confederacy. The same year and farther downriver, Confederates again sank a Union boat, the Maple Leaf, which struck a floating <b>keg</b> <b>filled</b> with explosives and settled into the muck near Julington Creek, south of Jacksonville. Part of the shipwreck was recovered in 1994, when it was discovered that many Civil War-era artifacts, including daguerreotypes and wooden matches, had been preserved in the river muck.|$|R
50|$|Later, Bob and {{the kids}} go to the frat house only to find Dr. Yap passed out, with his head shaved and his body covered in {{offensive}} words and drawings written in marker. Yap wakes up, telling them that the Alphas attacked him and stole Beta, the Iguana. Incensed, Bob and the Betas begin pranking the Alphas, who continue to send them Polaroids of Beta dressed in ludicrous outfits. When the Betas receive a letter of warning from the college dean placing them on academic probation for pranking the Alphas, Yap urges them to make one final strike against the Alphas during an award ceremony for their charity work. Yap has a <b>keg</b> <b>filled</b> with the saliva of his many patients and they plan to rig the keg to explode from under {{the stage of the}} ceremony, dousing the Alpha president. As they put the plan into action, the kids manage to break into the Room of Secrets, and find Beta hidden in the wall, along with the Polaroids and outfits allegedly used by the Alphas.|$|R
6000|$|Tied {{among the}} {{thickets}} were some twenty moaning tortoises, supplying Hunilla's lonely larder; while hundreds of vast tableted black bucklers, like displaced, shattered tomb-stones of dark slate, were also scattered round. These were the skeleton backs of those great tortoises from which Felipe and Truxill {{had made their}} precious oil. Several large calabashes and two goodly <b>kegs</b> were <b>filled</b> with it. In a pot near by were the caked crusts of a quantity which had been permitted to evaporate. [...] "They meant to have strained it off next day," [...] said Hunilla, as she turned aside.|$|R
60|$|At last it comes. One {{afternoon}} the barge carries the Commodore across the Bay {{to a fine}} water-side settlement of noblemen's seats, called Praya Grande. The Commodore is visiting a Portuguese marquis, and the pair linger long over their dinner in an arbour in the garden. Meanwhile, the cockswain has liberty to roam about where he pleases. He searches out a place where some choice red-eye (brandy) is to be had, purchases six large bottles, and conceals them among the trees. Under the pretence of filling the boat-keg with water, which is always kept in the barge to refresh the crew, he now carries it off into the grove, knocks out the head, puts the bottles inside, reheads the <b>keg,</b> <b>fills</b> it with water, carries {{it down to the}} boat, and audaciously restores it to its conspicuous position in the middle, with its bung-hole up. When the Commodore comes down to the beach, and they pull off for the ship, the cockswain, in a loud voice, commands the nearest man to take that bung out of the keg--that precious water will spoil. Arrived alongside the frigate, the boat's crew are overhauled, as usual, at the gangway; and nothing being found on them, are passed. The master-at-arms now descending into the barge, and finding nothing suspicious, reports it clean, having put his finger into the open bung of the keg and tasted that the water was pure. The barge is ordered out to the booms, and deep night is waited for, ere the cockswain essays to snatch the bottles from the keg.|$|R
50|$|Drake's {{operates}} a small tap room inside its barrel aging warehouse where growlers and <b>kegs</b> may be <b>filled</b> or purchased {{in addition to}} serving beer by the glass and bottle. Most of the barrel aged beers are unique to the tap room and are not usually available for growler or keg fills; Drake's first bottling of a barrel aged beer, Reunion Barley Wine Ale, occurred in 2013.|$|R
60|$|No {{first-class}} ship's steward {{can exist}} without possessing {{a more than}} average measure of executive ability. Dag Daughtry was a first-class ship's steward. Placing the Ancient Mariner in a nook of safety, and setting Big John to unlashing the remaining boat and hooking on the falls, he sent Kwaque into the hold to <b>fill</b> <b>kegs</b> {{of water from the}} scant remnant of supply, and Ah Moy to clear out the food in the galley.|$|R
5000|$|These kegs are {{stainless}} steel cylinders that hold approximately 5 U.S. gallons of liquid. The <b>keg</b> is <b>filled</b> with liquid via a removable hatch on the top, {{which is then}} closed and sealed. Carbon dioxide is added to pressurize the keg via an inlet port {{on the top and}} is facilitated by gently rocking the brew back and forth. Liquid is dispensed via an outlet port attached to a tube that extends {{to the bottom of the}} keg. Pin-lock and ball-lock fittings (or posts) are the two types of couplings used on the inlet and outlet ports. Coke distributors used pin-lock fittings, while Pepsi distributors used ball-lock fittings. Ball-lock are most used. The pin-lock style is often referred to as a [...] "Coke" [...] keg or style and the ball-lock is often referred to as a [...] "Pepsi" [...] keg or style, though the fittings themselves are removable, serviceable, and contain interchangeable parts.|$|R
50|$|The {{two boys}} then hid themselves, {{afraid of the}} {{consequences}} of their actions. At half past twelve the captain's cook noticed flames emerging from the forecastle, as he raised the alarm a <b>keg</b> exploded and <b>filled</b> the hold with flames. Several members of the crew attempted to quench the fire with water, even stripping their clothing to smother the flames, but the hold had become an inferno. The deck overhead was breached in an attempt to douse the flames, this allowed air to enter, increasing the intensity of the fire, and the front of the ship was soon ablaze.|$|R
60|$|Unfastening {{the cabin}} scuttle, we stepped {{downward}} into the smallest and murkiest den in the world. The altar-like transom, surmounted by the closed dead-lights in the stem, {{together with the}} dim little sky- light overhead, and the somber aspect of every thing around, gave the place the air of some subterranean oratory, say a Prayer Room of Peter the Hermit. But coils of rigging, bolts of canvas, articles of clothing, and disorderly heaps of rubbish, harmonized not with this impression. Two doors, one on each side, led into wee little state- rooms, the berths of which also were littered. Among other things, was a large box, sheathed with iron and stoutly clamped, containing a <b>keg</b> partly <b>filled</b> with powder, the half of an old cutlass, a pouch of bullets, and a case for a sextant--a brass plate on the lid, with the maker's name. London. The broken blade of the cutlass was very rusty and stained; and the iron hilt bent in. It looked so tragical that I thrust it out of sight.|$|R
2500|$|Dairies {{were founded}} from the Bear River Ridge {{to the south}} side of the Eel River {{starting}} in the late 1860s. [...] <b>Filled</b> <b>kegs</b> of butter were transported along the beach river by four-horse teams from the Mattole to Centerville or Port Kenyon and the teams returned supplies from Ferndale. [...] The eighty-one dairies from the southern area faded as the land along the Eel River Valley was settled for dairying, first by the Danes and later by other settlers. [...] In the 1880s multiple cooperative creameries in the Eel River valley began to process milk into butter; by 1904 the Central Creamery on Main Street Ferndale had combined the smaller operations into a more modern production facility. [...] The use of paper wrapping on butter to reduce air oxidizing the product was pioneered here at the suggestion of Chester E. Gray (1881-1944) from the U.S. Department of Agriculture who studied the problem of unrefrigerated fine butter turning white within hours of production. [...] Gray patented a new spray-drying process (U.S. Patent #858,868 - 1907 and #1,157,935 - 1915) and went into business with Central Creamery owner Aage Jensen in a new dry-milk manufacturing process to utilize non-fat milk solids which had formerly been waste of the process. [...] Their new plant processed 75,000 pounds of milk a day, shipping to San Francisco and filling contracts for the U.S. Navy. [...] In 1916 Grey and Jensen moved to San Francisco and changed the company name to Golden State Creamery.|$|R
