5|$|For {{a second}} DUI {{conviction}} in a 10-year period, irrespective of BAC, {{there is a}} fine of $500–$1,000, 2–90 days imprisonment, a 2-year license suspension, an automobile insurance surcharge of $1,000 a year for 3 years, and installation of an ignition <b>interlock</b> device for 1 to 3 years after license restoration. A person who has 3 or more DUI convictions and a gap of less than 10 years since the last conviction incurs a fine of $1,000, 6 months imprisonment, a 10-year license suspension, an automobile insurance surcharge of $1,500 a year for 3 years, and installation of an ignition <b>interlock</b> device for 1 to 3 years after license restoration. Jail sentences issued in New Jersey for DUI are often served through work release programs (e.g. weekends in jail).|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have a {{skeletal}} {{system that is}} structurally homologous to other tetrapods, though {{with a number of}} variations. They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The musculo{{skeletal system}} is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae <b>interlock</b> with each other by means of overlapping processes. The pectoral girdle is supported by muscle, and the well-developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.|$|E
5|$|Mulholland Drive (stylized as Mulholland Dr.) is a 2001 neo-noir mystery film {{written and}} {{directed}} by David Lynch and starring Naomi Watts, Laura Harring, Justin Theroux, Ann Miller, and Robert Forster. It tells the story of an aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts), newly arrived in Los Angeles, who meets and befriends an amnesiac woman (Harring) hiding in an apartment which belongs to Betty's aunt. The story includes several other seemingly unrelated vignettes that eventually <b>interlock,</b> as well as some surreal and darkly comic scenes and images that relate to the cryptic narrative.|$|E

30|$|The {{modelling}} of <b>interlocking</b> tables using CPN {{is presented}} in [36]. The developed CPN models comprise signalling layout that represents the physical arrangement of signals according to SBS system and <b>interlocking</b> control that represents actions performed for <b>interlocking</b> according to <b>interlocking</b> tables. These basic models can be reused to model more complex and large <b>interlocking</b> systems.

30|$|Apart from that, {{looking at}} the {{differences}} between {{inside and outside the}} political system, constructing cross-administrative <b>interlocking</b> directorate networks should be much easier than constructing cross-ownership <b>interlocking</b> networks because the former belongs to connections within the system whereas the latter belongs to cross-system connections. Due to this consideration, we can further categorize four types of <b>interlocking</b> networks: within-system <b>interlocking</b> whose controllers are at the same administrative level, within-system and cross-administrative-level <b>interlocking,</b> cross-system and cross-ownership <b>interlocking</b> relations, and <b>interlocking</b> relations outside of the system. The distribution and evolution of these four types of <b>interlocking</b> relations are worthy of in-depth investigation. Overall, Table  5 supports hypothesis 2; i.e., two companies in the same category of ownership are more likely to constitute <b>interlocking</b> directorate networks.|$|R
5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} is gregarious in nature. No {{distinct}} leader or any hierarchy is {{noted in the}} social structure; with no territorial behavior, fights are uncommon. While fighting, the lesser kudus <b>interlock</b> horns and try pushing one another. Mutual grooming is hardly observed. Unlike most tragelaphines, females can be closely associated for several years. One to three females, along with their offspring, may form a group. Juvenile males leave their mothers when aged a year-and-a-half, and may form pairs. However, {{at the age of}} four to five years, males prefer a solitary lifestyle and avoiding one another, though four or five bulls may share the same home range. Lesser kudu do not usually associate with other animals, except when they feed in the same area.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} frogs, salamanders and caecilians. They are tetrapods, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae <b>interlock</b> {{with each other and}} have articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, but contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping, a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist.|$|E
5|$|Parallel with {{improvements}} in sound-on-film technology, {{a number of}} companies were making progress with systems that recorded movie sound on phonograph discs. In sound-on-disc technology from the era, a phonograph turntable is connected by a mechanical <b>interlock</b> to a specially modified film projector, allowing for synchronization. In 1921, the Photokinema sound-on-disc system developed by Orlando Kellum was employed to add synchronized sound sequences to D. W. Griffith's failed silent film Dream Street. A love song, performed by star Ralph Graves, was recorded, as was a sequence of live vocal effects. Apparently, dialogue scenes were also recorded, but the results were unsatisfactory and the film was never publicly screened incorporating them. On May 1, 1921, Dream Street was re-released, with love song added, at New York City's Town Hall theater, qualifying it—however haphazardly—as the first feature-length film with a live-recorded vocal sequence. There would be no others for more than six years.|$|E

5|$|The 365-day haab was {{produced}} by a cycle of eighteen named 20-day winals, completed {{by the addition of}} 5-day period called the wayeb. The wayeb was considered to be a dangerous time, when the barriers between the mortal and supernatural realms were broken, allowing malignant deities to cross over and interfere in human concerns. In a similar way to the tz'olkin, the named winal would be prefixed by a number (from 0 to 19), {{in the case of the}} shorter wayeb period, the prefix numbers ran 0 to 4. Since each day in the tz'olkin had a name and number (e.g. 8 Ajaw), this would <b>interlock</b> with the haab, producing an additional number and name, to give any day a more complete designation, for example 8 Ajaw 13 Keh. Such a day name could only recur once every 52 years, and this period is referred to by Mayanists as the Calendar Round. In most Mesoamerican cultures, the Calendar Round was the largest unit for measuring time.|$|E
5|$|The viper dogfish has a slender, {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} moderately flattened head with a very short and blunt snout. Behind the large oval eyes are narrow, elliptical spiracles. The nostrils are nearly vertical slits. The jaws are long and narrowly triangular, and can be protruded from the head. The teeth are distinctively fang-like and widely spaced; the most anterior teeth are grooved lengthwise. Six to 10 upper and seven to 10 lower tooth rows occur on each side, along with a single tooth row at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are largest at the symphysis and decline in size towards the corners of the mouth. When the mouth is closed, the upper symphysial tooth overlaps the lower, while the lateral teeth <b>interlock.</b> Five gill slits are seen, with the fifth pair longer than the others.|$|E

The <b>interlock</b> was met with such a major public outcry that Congress rescinded the <b>interlock</b> regulation in late 1974 after a few early 1975 models were so equipped, permitting owners of all 1974 and the early 1975 models equipped with the <b>interlock</b> system to legally disconnect it.|$|E
30|$|This study {{demonstrates}} {{that there are}} still issues worthy of further discussion. The first is cross-ownership <b>interlocking</b> networks. Although our study supports the hypothesis that companies of the same ownership are very likely to form <b>interlocking</b> directorate networks, {{this does not mean that}} companies of different ownership cannot establish <b>interlocking</b> relations. How cross-ownership <b>interlocking</b> networks come about, how their constitutive motivation differs from that of mono-ownership <b>interlocking</b> networks, and what different influences cross-ownership and mono-ownership <b>interlocking</b> networks have on firm performance are questions in need of detailed discussion when looking at the constitutive nature of interfirm networks.|$|R

30|$|The third issue {{concerns}} the social function of <b>interlocking</b> directorate networks. Kono et al. (1998) argue that localized <b>interlocking</b> directorate relations {{are more likely}} to be an elite formation mechanism. Our study shows that regionally localized <b>interlocking</b> directorate networks are widespread in China. As a result, one question worthy of additional study is to determine whether localized <b>interlocking</b> directorate networks promote the cohesion of business elites or whether elite cohesion (e.g., co-membership in business clubs) promotes the formation of localized <b>interlocking</b> networks.|$|R
