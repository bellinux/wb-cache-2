40|$|We {{introduce}} in {{this paper}} a new method for reducing neurodynamical data to an effective diffusion equation, either experimentally or using simulations of biophysically detailed models. The dimensionality of the data is first reduced to the first principal component, and then fitted by the stationary solution of a mean-field-like one-dimensional Langevin equation, which describes the motion of a Brownian particle in a potential. The advantage of such description is that the stationary probability density of the dynamical variable can be easily derived. We applied this method {{to the analysis of}} cortical network dynamics during up and <b>down</b> <b>states</b> in an anesthetized animal. During deep anesthesia, intracellularly recorded up and <b>down</b> <b>states</b> transitions occurred with high regularity and could not be adequately described by a one-dimensional diffusion equation. Under lighter anesthesia, however, the distributions of the times spent in the up and <b>down</b> <b>states</b> were better fitted by such a model, suggesting a role for noise in determining the time spent in a particular state...|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{neuronal}} {{cortical network}} generates slow (, 1 Hz) spontaneous rhythmic activity {{that emerges from}} the recurrent connectivity. This activity occurs during slow wave sleep or anesthesia and also in cortical slices, consisting of alternating up (active, depolarized) and <b>down</b> (silent, hyperpolarized) <b>states.</b> The search for the underlying mechanisms {{and the possibility of}} analyzing network dynamics in vitro has been subject of numerous studies. This exposes the need for a detailed quantitative analysis of the membrane fluctuating behavior and computerized tools to automatically characterize the occurrence of up and <b>down</b> <b>states.</b> Methodology/Principal Findings. Intracellular recordings from different areas of the cerebral cortex were obtained from both in vitro and in vivo preparations during slow oscillations. A method that separates up and <b>down</b> <b>states</b> recorded intracellularly is defined and analyzed here. The method exploits the crossover of moving averages, such that transitions between up and down membrane regimes can be anticipated based on recent and past voltage dynamics. We demonstrate experimentally the utility and performance of this method both offline and online, the online use allowing to trigger stimulation or other events in the desired period of the rhythm. This technique is compared with a histogram-based approach that separates the states by establishing one or two discriminating membrane potential levels. The robustness of the method presented here is tested on data that departs from highly regular alternating up and <b>down</b> <b>states.</b> Conclusions/ Significance. We define a simple method to detect cortical states that can be applied in real time for offline processing of large amounts of recorded data on conventional computers.

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of noise on a neural {{population}} rate model of up and <b>down</b> <b>states.</b> Up and <b>down</b> <b>states</b> are typically observed in neuronal networks as a slow oscillation, where the population switches {{between high and low}} firing rates (Sanchez-Vivez and McCormick, 2000). A neural population model with spike rate adaptation is used to model such slow oscillations, and the timescale of adaptation determines the oscillation period. Furthermore, the period depends non-monotonically on the background tonic input driving the population, having long periods for very weak and very strong stimuli. Using both linearization and fast-slow timescale separation methods, we can compute the phase sensitivity function of the slow oscillation. We find that the phase response is most strongly impacted by perturbations to the adaptation variable. Phase sensitivity functions can then be utilized to quantify {{the impact of}} noise on oscillating populations. Noise alters the period of oscillations by speeding up the rate of transition between the up and <b>down</b> <b>states.</b> When common noise is presented to two distinct populations, their transitions will eventually become entrained to one another through stochastic synchrony.
