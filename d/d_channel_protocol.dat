In this paper we analyse the significance of public key secure <b>channel</b> <b>protocols</b> in multi application smart cards. We believe that multi application smart card technology (e. g. the GlobalPlatform smart card specification) should benefit more from the advantages of {{public key cryptography}} specifically for the initiation and maintenance of a secure channel. This paper introduces a public key based cryptographic protocol for secure entity authentication, data integrity and data confidentiality.

40|$|Three multibranch switch-and-stay {{combining}} (MSSC) schemes {{are analyzed}} for Rayleigh fading channels, where different decision statistics for antenna switching (i. e., switch statistic) are used. Let a and r denote the fading factor and the received baseband signal of a diversity branch, respectively. In {{contrast to the}} traditional MSSC that uses the faded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of diversity branches as the corresponding switch statistic, to enhance the receiver performance, |r|, |ar|, and a new linear combination of a and |r| are used as switch statistics of the three MSSC schemes, respectively. For performance evaluation, the bit error rate (BER) of BPSK is derived for the three MSSC schemes over both independent-and-identical distributed (i. i. d.) and independent-and-nonidentical distributed (i. n. <b>d.)</b> Rayleigh fading <b>channels.</b> To pursue optimal performance, the locally optimal switch threshold (ST) of each MSSC scheme is obtained for general i. n. <b>d.</b> fading <b>channels.</b> In addition, the locally optimal ST becomes the globally optimal ST for i. i. <b>d.</b> <b>channels.</b> Numerical results based on the analysis and simulations are presented.

40|$|Abstract—In this letter, {{the pilot}} signal design for mas-sive MIMO systems to {{maximize}} the training-based received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is considered under two channel models: block Gauss-Markov and block independent and iden-tically distributed (i. i. <b>d.)</b> <b>channel</b> models. First, it is shown that under the block Gauss-Markov channel model, the optimal pilot design problem reduces to a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem, which can be solved numerically by a standard convex optimization tool. Second, under the block i. i. <b>d.</b> <b>channel</b> model, an optimal solution is obtained in closed form. Numerical {{results show that the}} proposed method yields noticeably better performance than other existing pilot design methods in terms of received SNR.

40|$|A {{subspace}} {{method for}} channel estimation has been recently proposed [1] for tackling the pilot contamination effect, which is regarded by some researchers as a bottleneck in massive MIMO systems. It {{was shown in}} [1] that if the power ratio between the desired signal and interference is kept above a certain value, the received signal spectrum splits into signal and interference eigenvalues, namely, the "pilot contamination" effect can be completely eliminated. However, [1] assumes an independently distributed (i. <b>d.)</b> <b>channel,</b> which is actually not much the case in practice. Considering this, a more sensible finite-dimensional physical channel model (i. e., a finite scattering environment, where signals impinge on the base station (BS) from {{a finite number of}} angles of arrival (AoA)) is employed in this paper. Via asymptotic spectral analysis, it is demonstrated that, compared with the i. <b>d.</b> <b>channel,</b> the physical channel imposes a penalty {{in the form of an}} increased power ratio between the useful signal and the interference. Furthermore, we demonstrate an interesting "antenna saturation" effect, i. e., when the number of the BS antennas approaches infinity, the performance under the physical channel with P AoAs is limited by and nearly the same as the performance under the i. <b>d.</b> <b>channel</b> with P receive antennas.

In view of the likelihood of errors occurring in a lengthy interaction, it is desirable to incorporate this possibility in the model of communication.
