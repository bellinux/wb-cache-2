2500|$|In December 1982 {{the band}} {{recorded}} their second demo, {{this time at}} the Drone Studios in Chorlton-cum-Hardy; the tracks recorded were [...] "What Difference Does it Make?", [...] "Handsome Devil", and [...] "Miserable Lie". They had intended for this demo to serve as their audition tape for the record company EMI, but on hearing it the latter turned the band down. During {{the rest of that}} month, the band continued to practice, this time at the upstairs of the Portland Street Crazy Grace Clothing company, a space secured for them by their new manager Joe Moss. By Christmas they had created four new songs: [...] "These Things Take Time", [...] "What <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>in</b> Him?", [...] "Jeane", and [...] "A Matter of Opinion", the last of which they would soon scrap. Their next gig was Manchester's Manhattan in late January 1983, and although Maker would again appear as a go-go dancer, this was the last time that he did so. In early February they performed their third gig, at the city's Haçienda club.|$|E

But you and I were {{managing}} {{to get along with}} some sort of comfort. My practice was averaging around forty thousand a year then--I went over the books afterward. Palaces and steam yachts were about all that was denied you." ...|$|R

5000|$|Once the Norwegian Grouse team {{managed to}} make contact with the British, the British were suspicious, as they had not heard from the SOE team for a long time: they had been dropped at the wrong place and had gone off course from there several times. The secret {{question}} took the form of: [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the early morning of (a day)?" [...] The Grouse team replied: [...] "Three pink elephants." [...] The British were ecstatic at the success of the Norwegian team's insertion, and the next phase of operations commenced.|$|R

5000|$|When Giordano (the series' initial inker) had {{difficulty}} meeting deadlines while continuing as DC vice-president and executive editor, editorial coordinator Pat Bastienne reassigned the inking to Jerry Ordway despite Giordano's objections. According to writer Steve Gerber, Crisis on Infinite Earths [...] "got virtually no promotion ...

How much information was really {{distributed to the}} press and how much was gotten just by individual reporters going to Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez?"

6000|$|The Secretary thought, as {{he glanced}} at the schoolmaster's face, that he had opened a channel here indeed, and that it was an {{unexpectedly}} dark and deep and stormy one, and difficult to sound. All at once, {{in the midst of his}} turbulent emotions, Bradley stopped and seemed to challenge his look. Much as though he suddenly asked him, 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no fear, Father," [...] was {{the quiet}} reply. [...] "What is, is; a few frantic prayers now could alter nothing, and, besides, my work {{on earth is}} not yet over.

6000|$|During {{this short}} dialogue, his {{daughter}} had been observant of him, with something more than her usual interest. It would seem {{as though he had}} a changed or worn appearance in her eyes, and he perceived and resented it; for he said with renewed peevishness, when he had divested himself of his travelling-cloak, and had come to the fire: 'Amy, what are you looking at?

6000|$|... "Well, I don't see {{anything}} comical--greatly--except here an' there. Specially about those redooced charges <b>in</b> the guns. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> anything funny <b>in</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Ghost?" [...] {{repeated}} Mrs. Lecount, clasping {{her hands}} in graceful astonishment. [...] "Dear madam, pardon me! Is {{there such a thing}} in the world?

"For you {{priests and}} priestesses of El and Baaltis, {{think of my}} words, and raise the loud song of triumph to your gods when you yourselves are their offering, and the red flame of the fire burns you up, all of you save your sins, which are immortal. O {{citizens}} of an accursed city, look on the hill-top yonder and tell me, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> {{the light of the}} dying day? A sheen of spears, is it not? They draw near to your hearts, you whose day is done indeed, citizens of an accursed city whereof the very name shall be forgotten, and the naked towers shall become but a source of wonder to men unborn.|$|E

Now might I trouble you {{so far as to}} look out of this little window? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> front of you? A kitchen? Quite so; always a homely and pleasant sight in the eyes of an excellent housewife like yourself. And--do you mind bending forward a little? What do you see up there? A small barred window? Well, let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that a hungry man, a man who grows hungrier and hungrier, sat behind that window watching the cooks at their work and seeing the meat carried into this kitchen, to come out an hour or two later as hot, steaming, savoury joints, while he wasted, wasted, wasted and starved, starved, starved. Don't you think, my dear lady, {{that this would be a}} very unpleasant experience for that man?" ...|$|E

"And now," [...] {{said the}} latter, {{after he had}} {{separated}} the jewels into two nearly equal parts, and drawn one of them nearer to himself; [...] "and now," [...] said he, [...] "everything in this world has to be paid for, and some things sweetly. You must know, Mr. Hartley, if such be your name, that I am a man of a very easy temper, and good nature has been my stumbling-block from first to last. I could pocket the whole of these pretty pebbles, if I chose, and I should {{like to see you}} dare to say a word; but I think I must have taken a liking to you; for I declare I have not the heart to shave you so close. So, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>in</b> pure kind feeling, I propose that we divide; and these," [...] indicating the two heaps, [...] "are the proportions that seem to me just and friendly.
