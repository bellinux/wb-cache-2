5|$|Although the Poor Law Amendment Act did not ban {{all forms}} of outdoor relief, it stated that no able-bodied person was to receive money or other help from the Poor Law {{authorities}} <b>except</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> workhouse. Conditions in workhouses were to be made harsh to discourage people from claiming. Workhouses were {{to be built in}} every parish and, if parishes were too small, parishes could group together to form Workhouse Unions. The Poor Law Commissioners were to be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Act.|$|E
5|$|The {{cooperative}} gameplay {{originated from}} players' requests and from anecdotes of players {{working together on}} the same computer or console to solve the game's puzzles. Wolpaw likened this to players working together on the same computer to solve point-and-click adventure games. The cooperative campaign was also inspired by Valve's Left 4 Dead cooperative games, in which players enjoyed discussing their personal experiences with the game when they had finished playing it. While the single player campaign in Portal 2 is designed to avoid frustrating the player, the cooperative levels focus on coordination and communication, and Valve recognizes {{they are much more}} difficult than the single-player puzzles. Valve did not include timed puzzles in the single-player campaigns in Portal and Portal 2, but found that their inclusion in the cooperative mode is effective and gives players a positive feeling after they successfully plan and execute difficult maneuvers. Each puzzle chamber in the cooperative mode requires four portals to solve to prevent puzzles being solved by the actions of only one player. As soon as a playtester discovered a way to complete a puzzle with one set of portals, the level was sent back to the designers for further work. <b>Except</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few cases, Valve designed the chambers so that both players would remain in sight of each other to promote communication and cooperation. Some of the puzzle chambers were designed asymmetrically; one player would manipulate portals and controls to allow the other player to cross the room, emphasizing that the two characters, while working together, are separate entities. The designers soon realized that the ability to tag surfaces with instructional icons for one's partner was a necessary element, since they found this to be more effective for cooperation than simple, verbal instructions.|$|E

While not seen in Dirge of Cerberus <b>except</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> flashback, it is hinted that he is secretly funding the WRO (World Regenesis Organization). Rufus is voiced by Wally Wingert in English and Tōru Ōkawa in Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Riders usually wear tall dress boots, {{although}} field boots or paddock {{boots with}} half chaps may be worn by riders {{at the lower}} levels.

Whips are not permitted in eventing dressage when entering space around arena or during the test for FEI events.

25|$|Some {{other planets}} and moons in the Solar System have {{sufficiently}} rigid structures to have preserved records {{of their own}} histories, for example, Venus, Mars and the Earth's Moon. Dominantly fluid planets, such as the gas giants, do not preserve their history in a comparable manner. Apart from the Late Heavy Bombardment, events on other planets probably had little direct influence on the Earth, and events on Earth had correspondingly little effect on those planets. Construction of a time scale that links the planets is, therefore, of only limited relevance to the Earth's time scale, <b>except</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Solar System context. The existence, timing, and terrestrial effects of the Late Heavy Bombardment is still debated.|$|E

25|$|Speaking at {{a conference}} {{organised}} by The Library Campaign and Voices for the Library he added: The book {{is second only to}} the wheel as the best piece of technology human beings have ever invented. A book symbolises the whole intellectual history of mankind; it's the greatest weapon ever devised in the war against stupidity. Beware of anyone who tries to make books harder to get at. And that is exactly what these closures are going to do – oh, not intentionally, <b>except</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few cases; very few people are stupid intentionally; but that will be the effect. Books will be harder to get at. Stupidity will gain a little ground.|$|E
25|$|Recent sea erosion {{has caused}} loss {{of more than}} half the width of the village in the 20th century. This recent erosion, in many {{geological}} analyses, is considered to be an indirect result of the man-made development of the Cochin estuary into Cochin harbor. Sea erosion has been controlled for the last three decades by seawalls. The price paid is the loss of the once long and beautiful white sandy beaches, <b>except</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few areas left free of seawalls. Mechanized gates, where the backwaters flow into the Arabian Sea, regulate the flow of seawater entering the paddy fields of Pallithode, Thuravoor, Pattanakad, and Ezhupunna, and they also prevent flooding of paddy fields during heavy rainfalls.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century {{a common}} belief {{was that the}} Jews, {{particularly}} the Lost Ten Tribes, were the ancestors of Native Americans and the Mound Builders. The Book of Mormon (published first during 1830) provides a related belief, as its narrative describes two major immigrations to the Americas from Mesopotamia: the Jaredites (c. 3000–2000 BCE) and an Israelite group during 590 BCE (termed Nephites, Lamanites and Mulekites). While the Nephites, Lamanites, and Mulekites were all of Jewish origin coming from Israel around 590 BCE, the Jaradites were a non-Abrahamic people separate in all aspects, <b>except</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> belief in Jehovah, from the Nephites. The Book of Mormon depicts these settlers building magnificent cities, which were destroyed by warfare about CE 385.|$|E
