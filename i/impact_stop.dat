40|$|A single {{degree of}} freedom {{mechanical}} spring-mass system was considered where {{the motion of the}} mass is constrained by an adjustable rigid <b>impact</b> <b>stop.</b> A model reference adaptive control algorithm combined with interspike interval techniques was used to consider the viability of identifying system parameters when impacts are present. The unmodified adaptive control algorithm destabilizes during vibro-impact motion, so three modified control algorithms were tested experimentally. The first, the gain reset, was found to be of limited use and system identification could not be successfully carried out. The second and third used a gain pause strategy. The second algorithm used acceleration triggering and represented an improvement on the gain reset method. The third approach used displacement triggering and was found to be partially successful in identifying system parameters in the presence of vibro-impact motion...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the dynamics of}} impact oscillators with multiple degrees of freedom subject {{to more than one}} motion limiting constraint or stop. A mathematical formulation for modeling such systems is developed using a modal approach including a modal form of the coefficient of restitution rule. The possible impact configurations for an N degree of freedom system are considered, along with definitions of the impact map for multiply constrained systems. We consider sticking motions that occur when a single mass in the system becomes stuck to an <b>impact</b> <b>stop,</b> and discuss the computational issues related to computing such solutions. Then using the example of a two degree of freedom system with two constraints we describe exact modal solutions for the free flight and sticking motions which occur in this system. Numerical examples of sticking orbits for this system are shown and we discuss identifying the region, S in phase space where these orbits exist. We use bifurcation diagrams to indicate differing regimes of vibro-impacting motion for two different cases; firstly when the stops are both equal and on the same side (i. e. the same sign) and secondly when the stops are unequal and of opposing sign. For these two different constraint configurations we observe qualitatively different dynamical behavior, which is interpreted using impact mappings and two-dimensional parameter space. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The tongue {{moves in}} a narrow space which {{influences}} the speech planning process and affects the kinematic properties of the movement. In order to study the possible role of tongue-palate interaction we investigated tongue tip movement together with tonguepalatal contact patterns by means of simultaneous EMA and EPG recordings. Articulatory data for four German speakers were analyzed. Speech material consisted of VC and VC@ sequences with C being /t/ or /s/ and V being stressed tense /a/ or /u/. The relation between the kinematics of the tongue tip closing gesture and changes in tongue-palatal contact patterns in the anterior, posterior and lateral region were studied. Results for /t/ show a large movement amplitude and a short closing gesture duration whereas in /s/ production the movement amplitude is smaller and the duration longer than in /t/. We conclude that in /t/ the tongue tip hits the palate and this <b>impact</b> <b>stops</b> the movement. In /s/ production we suppose that a precise positioning of the tongue tip is achieved. Speaker dependent tongue-palatal contact patterns can be {{explained in terms of}} differences in the palatal shape...|$|R

Energy is dissipated discontinuously in discrete amounts, through <b>impacts</b> with the <b>stop.</b> We prove the existence of a nonzero measure set of orbits that lead to infinite <b>impacts</b> with the <b>stop</b> in a finite time.

40|$|The {{process of}} forest cover {{regeneration}} after {{the cessation of}} human impact was considered. The study area was situated {{in the southern part}} of the Kenozersky National Park, Arkhangelsk Oblast. This area has 500 years of agricultural land use history. The territory features a complete spectrum of land at some point used for agricultural production: from sites currently in active use to fully recovered tree stands aged 120 – 140 years. The reforestation process was considered separately for each of the following land uses: slash-and-burn, multipurpose small-patch, and arable-grassland types, which differ considerably in impact intensity, duration, and degree of disturbance of the forest environment. The course of forest regeneration successions was found to depend on the type of preceding land use. The time required for the forest communities in slash-and-burn sites to recover to their original state is 120 – 140 years, and the succession involves the deciduous stage. Multipurpose small-patch use left the forest environment more profoundly modified. Eventually, a majority of these sites are now occupied by more productive, although undistinguishable from the original, coniferous-deciduous stands. Some factors have been detected that may lead to the formation in such sites of low-productivity self-regenerating plant communities dominated by deciduous species, which can persist there for an indefinitely long time unless relevant actions are taken. Arable-grassland land use considerably inhibits the regeneration of the forest cover typical of middle taiga, because there forms a thick sod layer. It was only in some grassland patches, where the <b>impact</b> <b>stopped</b> 5 – 10 years ago, that coniferous species, namely pine, were successfully regenerating...|$|R

The second principal result characterises the random time models that preserve the NUPBR property after stopping for any quasi-left-continuous market model. The analysis that drives these results is based on new stochastic developments in martingale theory with progressive enlargement of filtration.

40|$|A low {{friction}} tractor seat with nonlinear stiffness and dead-band damping was investigated both by simulation and experimentation. The {{objective was to}} determine if a practical, soft suspension system could be developed that offered improved vibration performance compared to a typical mechanical commercial tractor seat suspension. A hard damper was used to prevent end <b>stop</b> <b>impacts</b> that were more likely with the soft suspension. In addition the damper had a dead-band centered at the seat's static equilibrium position. The dead-band damping was achieved with a switchable damper using relative seat displacement as the control signal. The objective of the dead-band was to allow a soft undamped operating region that gave good vibration attenuation. If the relative seat displacement passed the dead-band limits due to sudden harsh inputs, the hard damping would take over and prevent end <b>stop</b> <b>impacts.</b> An experimental rig with nonlinear seat and switchable damping was built and tested with the same parameters and inputs as those used in the simulations.

40|$|When {{operating}} the anvil hammers there occur impacts of die tooling {{and as a}} consequence, virtually instantaneous <b>impact</b> <b>stops</b> of motion of drop hammer parts. Such operating conditions come with accelerated failures of the anvil hammer rods because of emerging significant wave stresses. Engineering practice widely uses variation, difference, and integral methods to calculate wave stresses. However, to use them a researcher has to acquire certain skills, and the special programs should be available. The paper considers a method for estimating the wave stress changes in the anvil hammer rods, {{which is based on}} the wave equation of the Laplace transform. It presents a procedure for generating differential equations and their solution using the operator method. These equations describe the wave processes of strain and stress propagation in the anvil hammer rod under non-rigid impact with the compliance obstacle of the drop hammer parts. The work defines how the piston and rod mass and also the mechanical and geometric parameters of the rod influence on the stress level in the rod sealing of the hammer ram. Analysis of the results shows that the stresses in the rod sealing are proportional to the total amount of wave stresses caused by the rod and piston impact included in the total weight of the system. The piston influence on the stresses in the rod under impact is in direct proportion to the ratio of its mass to the mass of the rod. Geometric parameters of the rod and speed of drop parts before the impact influence on the stress value as well. It was found that if the time of impact is less than the time of the shock wave running in forward and backward direction, the impact with a compliance obstacle is equivalent to that of with a rigid obstacle, and the dependence of the wave stresses follows the Zhukovsky formula of direct pressure shock. The presented method of stress calculation can be successfully used to select the optimal mass and the rod and piston geometric parameters under non-rigid impact without damping and taking into account the energy dissipation until stiff stop of drop hammer parts...|$|R
