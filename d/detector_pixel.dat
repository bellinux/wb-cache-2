By following the diffracted intensity in one pixel across the entire sequence of images, local rocking curves from very small areas of sample surface can be reconstructed.Although the required post-processing and numerical analysis is sometimes moderately demanding, the effort is often compensated by very comprehensive information on the sample's local properties. Quantities that become quantitatively measurable in this way include local scattering power, local lattice tilts (crystallite misorientation), and local lattice quality and perfection.

30|$|Flat panel {{detectors}} (FPDs) {{are used}} to obtain high resolution computed tomography (CT) image. But due to technical faults of these FPDs, ring artifacts are often generated in the CT image. These artifacts {{may be caused by}} damaged <b>detector</b> <b>pixels,</b> mis-calibrated <b>detector</b> <b>pixels,</b> impurities in scintillator crystal or dust on scintillator screens. All these phenomena attribute to the generation of a number of concentric superimposed rings in the reconstructed image which correspond to stripe artifacts in sinogram domain. These rings can be of different types and of different intensities. As for example, completely damaged <b>detector</b> <b>pixels</b> cause strong isolated or band rings. Similar artifacts also arise from dusty or damaged scintillator screens [1]. On the other hand, mis-calibrated detector elements lead to less strong ring artifacts in the tomographic image [2]. These artifacts are also sensitive to tube voltage. Changes in the tube voltage alter the intensity of the ring. As these artifacts severely degrades the image quality by obscuring significant image details, it is necessary to remove them, otherwise, post processing, such as noise reduction or segmentation of image information, becomes quite difficult.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "MAXIM" [...] (MAterials X-ray IMaging) {{method is}} another method {{combining}} diffraction analysis with spatial resolution. It {{can be viewed}} as serial topography with additional angular resolution in the exit beam. In contrast to the Rocking Curve Imaging method, it is more appropriate for more highly disturbed (polycrystalline) materials with lower crystalline perfection. The difference on the instrumental side is that MAXIM uses an array of slits / small channels (a so-called [...] "multi-channel plate" [...] (MCP), the two-dimensional equivalent of a Soller slit system) as an additional X-ray optical element between sample and CCD detector. These channels transmit intensity only in specific, parallel directions, and thus guarantee a one-to-one-relation between detector pixels and points on the sample surface, which would otherwise not be given in the case of materials with high strain and/or a strong mosaicity. The spatial resolution of the method is limited by a combination of <b>detector</b> <b>pixel</b> size and channel plate periodicity, which in the ideal case are identical. The angular resolution is mostly given by the aspect ratio (length over width) of the MCP channels.|$|E

WIIT operates at optical wavelengths and uses Michelson beam combination to achieve both wide-field imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy. It will be used chiefly to test the feasibility of using a large-format detector array at the image plane of the sky to obtain wide-field interferometry images through mosaicing techniques. In this setup each <b>detector</b> <b>pixel</b> records interferograms corresponding to averaging a particular pointing range on the sky as the optical path length is scanned and as the baseline separation and orientation is varied. The final image is constructed through spatial and spectral Fourier transforms of the recorded interferograms for each pixel, followed by a mosaic/joint-deconvolution procedure of all the pixels. In this manner the image within the pointing range of each <b>detector</b> <b>pixel</b> is further resolved to an angular resolution corresponding to the maximum baseline separation for fringe measurements. We present the motivation for building the testbed, show the optical, mechanical, control, and data system design, and describe the image processing requirements and algorithms.

40|$|Developed is an {{algorithmic}} {{approach for}} wide {{field of view}} interferometric spatial-spectral image synthesis. The data collected from the interferometer consists {{of a set of}} double-Fourier image data cubes, one cube per baseline. These cubes are each three-dimensional consisting of arrays of two-dimensional detector counts versus delay line position. For each baseline a moving delay line allows collection of a large set of interferograms over the 2 D wide field detector grid; one sampled interferogram per <b>detector</b> <b>pixel</b> per baseline. This aggregate set of interferograms, is algorithmically processed to construct a single spatial-spectral cube with angular resolution approaching the ratio of the wavelength to longest baseline. The wide field imaging is accomplished by insuring that the range of motion of the delay line encompasses the zero optical path difference fringe for each <b>detector</b> <b>pixel</b> in the desired field-of-view. Each baseline cube is incoherent relative to all other baseline cubes and thus has only phase information relative to itself. This lost phase information is recovered by having point, or otherwise known, sources within the field-of-view. The reference source phase is known and utilized as a constraint to recover the coherent phase relation between the baseline cubes and is key to the image synthesis.
