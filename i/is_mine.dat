5|$|Possessive pronouns {{exist in}} {{dependent}} and independent forms; the dependent form {{functions as a}} determiner specifying a noun (as in my chair), while the independent form can stand alone {{as if it were}} a noun (e.g. the chair <b>is</b> <b>mine).</b> The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address, and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as y'all found in Southern American English and African American (Vernacular) English or youse and ye found in Irish English.|$|E

5|$|In similar fashion, many leading {{directors}} {{made one}} or more films at RKO during this era, including Alfred Hitchcock once more, with Notorious, and Jean Renoir, with This Land <b>Is</b> <b>Mine</b> (1943), reuniting Laughton and O'Hara, and The Woman on the Beach (1947). John Ford's The Fugitive (1947) and Fort Apache (1948), which appeared right before studio ownership changed hands again, were followed by She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and Wagon Master (1950); all four were co-productions between RKO and Argosy Pictures, the company run by Ford and RKO alumnus Merian C. Cooper. Of the directors under long-term contract to RKO in the 1940s, the best known was Edward Dmytryk, who first came to notice with the remarkably profitable Hitler's Children (1943). Shot on a $205,000 budget placing it in the bottom quartile of Big Five studio productions, {{it was one of}} the ten biggest Hollywood hits of the year. Another low-cost war-themed film directed by Dmytryk, Behind the Rising Sun, released a few months later, was similarly profitable.|$|E
5|$|Longyearbyen {{is divided}} into several neighbourhoods. On {{the west side of}} the river, along the bay, lies the port and {{affiliated}} utility and industrial services. The western part of this area is called Bykaia and the eastern part Sjøområdet. Above lies Skjæringa, the site of the Governor's offices. Slightly up the valley on the west side lies Gamle Longyearbyen ("Old Longyearbyen") and the church. Even further up lies the graveyard, then Huset and the cinema, and finally Sverdrupbyen. Most of the residential, commercial and cultural institutions are located on the east side of the river. Along the bay the area is called Sjøskrenten. Further up lies the university centre and Gruvedalen, the largest residential area. Southwards from there is the main shopping area as well as the town hall. To the east is the residential area Lia and further up Haugen, which is also the location of the school. Furthest up in the valley <b>is</b> <b>Mine</b> 2b and Nybyen, which is mostly used as student housing. Westwards out of town towards Hotellneset is the airport and Mine 3. The remaining mines are located in Adventdalen, to the east of town.|$|E
5|$|O'Hara {{played the}} love {{interest}} of Henry Fonda in the 1943 war picture Immortal Sergeant. O'Hara noted that Fonda was studying for his service entry exams {{at the time}} and had his head in books between takes, and that 20th Century Fox publicized one of the last love scenes between them in the film as Fonda's last screen kiss before entering the war. She next portrayed a European school teacher opposite George Sanders and Charles Laughton, in their last film together, in Jean Renoir's This Land <b>Is</b> <b>Mine</b> for RKO. At the end of a court case in the film, during a hearty speech by Laughton, O'Hara is shown teary-eyed on screen for a prolonged period. Malone thought her performance was effective, both crying and smiling, though considered Renoir to have overdone the film and confusing the audience as a result.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{the area}} was named Cragmore, {{beginning}} about 1859, the area <b>was</b> <b>mined</b> for coal. There <b>were</b> 50 coal <b>mines</b> in Colorado Springs. The Cragmor <b>mines</b> <b>were</b> the City <b>Mine,</b> the Altitude, Williamsville Mine, Curtis Mine, Patterson Mine, the Climax mines, the Conley, Busy Bee, and the Danville.

25|$|While {{originally}} {{developed as a}} tool for range land use and restoring desertified land, the holistic management system can be applied to other areas with multiple complex socioeconomic and environmental factors. One such example is Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), which promotes sector integration in development and management of water resources to ensure that water is allocated between different users in a fair way, maximizing economic and social welfare without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems. In essence, coordinated holistic water management takes into consideration all water users in nature and society. Another example <b>is</b> <b>mine</b> reclamation. A fourth use of Holistic management is in certain forms of no till crop production, intercropping, and permaculture. Holistic management has been acknowledged by The United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS).|$|E
25|$|Above all I want no long {{faces and}} no show of grief at the burying ground. Kindly observe the final {{wishes of the}} {{undersigned}} and avoid reading the so-called Christian burial service which, {{in view of the}} language employed in it, I regard {{as one of the most}} cruel and paganish things inherited by our forebears from our remote pagan ancestors. In deference to the faith of our dear mother who was through her lifetime a loyal though never bigoted communicant of that congregation, perhaps the current pastor of the First Presbyterian Church would consent to read the Twenty-third Psalm, which was her favorite passage in the Scriptures and <b>is</b> <b>mine</b> since it contains no charnel words, no morbid mouthings about corruption and decay and, being mercifully without creed or dogma, carries no threat of eternal hell-fire for those parties we do not like, no direct promise of a heaven which, if one may judge by the people who are surest of going there, must be a powerfully dull place, populated to a considerable and uncomfortable degree by prigs, time-servers and unpleasantly aggressive individuals. Hell may have a worse climate but undoubtedly the company is sprightlier. The Catholics, with their genius for stage-management, handle this detail better. The officiating clergyman speaks in Latin and the parishioners, being unacquainted with that language are impressed by the majesty of the rolling, sonorous periods without being shocked by tressing allusions and harrowing references.|$|E

Music journalist Aidin Vaziri criticized the song, stating, [...] " [...] Black Eyed Peas rapper completely erases Paul McCartney's vocal track from the original duet to make room for himself spouting nonsense such as, 'I call her mommy and she call me papa/I'm sorry Mike, but she loves the way I rock-a.'"

Kelefa Sanneh of Blender noted that [...] "will.i.am contributes beats (why?) and rhymes (why, oh, why?) to [...] "The Girl <b>Is</b> <b>Mine</b> 2008"". IGN's Todd Gilchrist stated that will.i.am's [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] remix was an offense.
