50|$|As {{the largest}} MVNO in Malaysia, {{the company has}} a {{business}} model that allows it to focus on its products, marketing and customer service, as it does not have any costs associated with building or maintaining a full cellular network. Hence an MVNO like Tune Talk can keep its capital investments low to pass on lower rates to subscribers and focus on improving customer service. Tune Talk offers subscribers <b>full</b> <b>roaming</b> through Celcom’s roaming arrangements.|$|E
40|$|A {{new concept}} in {{automated}} storage and retrieval systems is the <b>full</b> <b>roaming</b> shuttle system, the distinguishing feature {{of which is}} that its material handling shuttles are not aisle-captive, but can easily switch aisles and levels in the storage area. A consequence of this flexibility is that shuttles more often overtake each other and deliver product totes in a different sequence than they are requested. In case of strict sequence requirements for delivered totes, this leads to more waiting time of shuttles and thus to loss of throughput capacity. In this paper we propose heuristics to assign tasks to shuttles that aim at minimizing the number of out-of-sequence occurrences and at maximizing the throughput capacity. These heuristics are evaluated through simulation. The results suggest that, in comparison to first-in first-out task assignment, substantial throughput improvement can be achieved by employing smart task assignment heuristics...|$|E

50|$|Shadowgate 64 has {{the same}} first-person view of the first game, though this time the static screens of the {{original}} were replaced by <b>full</b> 3D <b>roaming</b> {{similar to that of}} the first-person shooters. Despite the graphical changes, the core game is similar: the game relies mostly on solving puzzles and riddles rather than fighting enemies. The warden and dwarf-like guards are the only enemies to be found, and they have to be avoided. There are many instances in which Del can die, such as a fall from a moderate height or dropping into deep water. The player must find ways around everything through interaction with the environment.|$|R

Taking the {{passenger}} seat in the Iowa State Campus Police car, flashbacks of “Reno 911 ” episodes ran through my mind as I imagined all of the sweet moves that would be thrown down on every freshman traveling with a backpack <b>full</b> of Keystone. <b>Roaming</b> through Campustown, we drove slowly, circling the mass of students traveling between parties and bar...|$|R
50|$|FromSoftware {{released}} King's Field, a <b>full</b> polygon free <b>roaming</b> first-person real-time action {{title for}} the Sony PlayStation in December 1994. Sega's 32X release Metal Head was a first-person shooter mecha simulation game that used fully texture-mapped, 3D polygonal graphics. A year prior, Exact released the Sharp X68000 computer game Geograph Seal, a fully 3D polygonal first-person shooter that employed platform game mechanics and had most of the action take place in free-roaming outdoor environments rather than the corridor labyrinths of Wolfenstein 3D. The following year, Exact released its successor for the PlayStation console, Jumping Flash!, which used the same game engine but adapted it to place more emphasis on the platforming rather than the shooting. The Jumping Flash! series continued {{to use the same}} engine.|$|R

It is {{believed}} that once a priest {{used to live in}} that forest & many time he saw one lady with wearing <b>full</b> of ornaments <b>roaming</b> around the forest.Many times the priest tried to ascertain who she was but he failed. One day he got the chance to know who is she, and when he asked the lady to turn back and to show her face then the lady suddenly turned into a stone. On the same night, The Goddess “Mangala” appeared in his dream and requested him to make a small temple for her. After that the priest and the villagers worshiped the goddess named Maa Mangala. Maa Jhanjiri Mangala named by one person when Maa Mangala Saved him from the high sunny Day when {{he was going to die}} by the sun's heat (In odiya Jhanji).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{number of}} mobile devices within academia has {{increased}} significantly {{over the last}} couple of years and users expect to be able to get connectivity everywhere, at home, on the road and at educational institutions. At the same time however, the security of wireless LANs becomes more and more of a concern In 2003, the TERENA Task Force on Mobility [1] was created to look at WLAN security issues and to formulate requirements to design an international roaming solution that would provide National Research and Educational Networks’ (NRENs’) users with secure Internet access at academic campuses across Europe. The solution proposed was tested and proved to be very successful with more and more institutions joining it. This infrastructure is called eduroam, which stands for Education Roaming. Within the 6 th framework project GÉANT 2 [2], the aim is to expand the existing infrastructure into a pan-European <b>full</b> service for <b>Roaming</b> and Authentication/Authorisation...|$|R
