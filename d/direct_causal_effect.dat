For instance, a 2005 analysis of 186 pre-industrial societies found that corporal punishment was more prevalent in societies which also had higher rates of homicide, assault, and war. In the United States, domestic corporal punishment has been linked to later violent acts against family members and spouses.

40|$|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and {{educational}} achievement are negatively associated in children.

The causal effect is tested in a genetically sensitive design to exclude the possibility of confounding by a third factor (e. g. genetic pleiotropy) and by comparing educational achievement and secondary school career in children with ADHD who take or do not take methylphenidate. Data on ADHD symptoms, educational achievement and methylphenidate usage were available in a primary school sample of ~ 10, 000 12 -year-old twins from the Netherlands Twin Register. A substantial group also had longitudinal data at ages 7 – 12 years. ADHD symptoms were cross-sectionally and longitudinally, associated with lower educational achievement at age 12. More ADHD symptoms predicted a lower-level future secondary school career at age 14 – 16. In both the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, testing the <b>direct</b> <b>causal</b> <b>effect</b> of ADHD on educational achievement, while controlling for genetic and environmental factors, revealed an association between ADHD symptoms {{and educational}} achievement independent of genetic and environmental pleiotropy.

30|$|Finally, {{the third}} channel {{considered}} is the direct effect of parental {{education on the}} schooling attainment of the children. This channel is generally known as the nurture effect, capturing the <b>direct</b> <b>causal</b> <b>effect</b> of parental education (Holmlund et al. 2011; Chevalier 2004). Dickson et al. (2013) show that this <b>direct</b> <b>causal</b> <b>effect</b> starts at very early ages and remains visible years later when comparing students’ performances. Different explanations why parental education should have a <b>direct</b> <b>causal</b> <b>effect</b> {{can be found in}} the literature. One possible explanation is that highly educated parents tend to encourage their children more to achieve high levels of education (Merton 1953; Boudon 1973, 1974; Sewel and Shah 1968). For instance, Steinberg et al. (1992) show that parental encouragement and parental school involvement have important effects on the school performance of children. Besides this active encouragement and involvement of parents, it can also be argued that the child’s aspirations increase when parents have more education (Sewel and Shah 1968; Ermisch et al. 2006). Ermisch et al. (2006) argue that parental education can alter the productivity of parents’ time investments in children. It could also be argued that expected returns to education depend on parental education. Jensen (2010) shows that students with higher educated parents tend to perceive higher returns to education. Hence, this third channel is motivated by a series of arguments and most likely composed of different sub-channels. The distinction of these different sub-channels is beyond the scope of this paper. In this paper I consider a compound channel linking high parental education to high offspring’s schooling.|$|E

In {{the light}} of social identity theory and contact theory, this study looked at the effects of racial identity on contact and prejudice. The sample consisted of 826 UCT students who belonged to the White and African population groups. Their mean age was 20. 50 and they were 52. 54 % females and 47. 46 % males. A pilot study using 42 participants answered questions concerning the face validity of the scales and questions aimed at testing the on-line system for data collection. The data was gathered {{by means of a}} questionnaire accessed by the participants on-line. The interval scales measuring racial identity, nature and frequency of contact and prejudice/social distance were all found to have Cronbach's coefficient alphas bigger than. 73. Another variable measured the proportion of cross-race friendships as a percentage. Two statistical techniques were used to analyse the data: path analysis and simultaneous multiple regressions. Some information was added by the theme analysis of the comments of the participants concerning the study. The results of the study revealed total mean values above the mid-point for all variables that are: in-group identity, nature and frequency of contact, positive feelings of the participants towards each other and desire for interracial contact. Two things are salient in {{the results of the present}} study: a) interracial contact did not allow cross-race friendships forming at a moderate or high percentage and; b) in the African population group racial identity (social identity) did not have statistically significant effects on prejudice and social distance. It did have them when the group was split by gender. Two research hypotheses were confirmed and the other two were partially confirmed. Racial identity had a <b>direct</b> negative <b>causal</b> <b>effect</b> on nature of contact for the entire sample and for the White population group. It also had an indirect negative <b>causal</b> <b>effect</b> on prejudice and social distance via nature of contact for the entire sample and the White population group.

Racial identity had <b>direct</b> <b>causal</b> <b>effects</b> on prejudice for the African males and females separately. Nature of contact had the strongest <b>direct</b> positive <b>causal</b> <b>effects</b> on prejudice/social distance. The variance in prejudice/social distance is explained by racial identity, nature and frequency of contact acting together, with the nature of contact being the strongest contributor.
