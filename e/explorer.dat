5|$|Acid2 was {{designed}} with Microsoft Internet <b>Explorer</b> particularly in mind. The creators of Acid2 were dismayed that Internet <b>Explorer</b> {{did not follow}} web standards. It was prone to display web pages differently from other browsers, causing web developers to spend time tweaking their web pages. Acid2 challenged Microsoft to make Internet <b>Explorer</b> comply with web standards.|$|E
5|$|Explorer/Air Explorer/Sea <b>Explorer</b> : The <b>Explorer</b> badge {{is split}} into three {{different}} badges {{for the three}} different Scouting sections (Land Scouts, Air Scouts and Sea Scouts). The <b>Explorer</b> badge teaches the Scout {{to take control of}} situations, and requires the Scout to plan and run larger activities: an orienteering wide game for the whole troop, an incident hike for their Patrol, a Patrol expedition, and a troop campfire.|$|E
5|$|Most Scouts {{choose to}} work on the <b>Explorer</b> badge that is related to the section of Scouting their Troop belongs to, but {{there is no reason why}} a Scout can not do an <b>Explorer</b> badge from another section. The only {{difference}} between the three <b>Explorer</b> badges is the three compulsory interest badges that are required, and the design of the badge.|$|E
5000|$|On February 8, 1999, the South American <b>Explorers</b> Club was sued by the New York <b>Explorers</b> Club in the Northern District {{court of}} New York. The {{accusation}} was [...] "infringement by South American <b>Explorers</b> Club of various marks {{owned by the}} <b>Explorers</b> Club," [...] although 20 years earlier the Club had formed with the express consent of the <b>Explorers</b> Club. The lawsuit was prompted by sponsorship deals the <b>Explorers</b> Club was seeking to establish with American Express and other firms.

5|$|Acid2 {{was first}} {{proposed}} by Håkon Wium Lie, {{chief technical officer}} of Opera Software and creator of the widely used Cascading Style Sheets web standard. In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET, Lie expressed dismay that Microsoft Internet <b>Explorer</b> did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely interoperable with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to Microsoft to design Internet <b>Explorer</b> 7, then in development, to achieve {{a greater degree of}} standards compliance than previous versions of Internet <b>Explorer.</b> The original Acid1 test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 would do the same.|$|E
5|$|Alpha {{transparency}} in PNG-format images: The {{eyes of the}} smiley face use alpha transparency, {{which is part of}} the 1996 Portable Network Graphics specification. Alpha transparency blends the eyebrows into the face smoothly and elegantly. This was a significant issue because Internet <b>Explorer</b> 6, the most widely used web browser at the time Acid2 was released, did not support alpha transparency. This deficiency was rectified in Internet <b>Explorer</b> 7, bringing Internet <b>Explorer</b> in line with other web browsers in this regard.|$|E
