5|$|The blades are transtibial prostheses, {{meaning they}} replace {{legs and feet}} that are amputated below the knee (BK).

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} impact of <b>jumps</b> <b>and</b> {{simultaneous}} <b>jumps</b> (co-jumps) in asset prices on future volatility. Our main {{contribution to the}} empirical literature lies {{in the use of}} panel Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) model that allows us to obtain average effect of jumps for both the portfolio of 29 U. S. stocks and 8 individual market sectors our stocks belong to. On top of that we investigate the effect of sign for both <b>jumps</b> <b>and</b> co-jumps. The estimation results indicate that the impact of jumps on future volatility is positive whereas for co-jumps it is negative. We also document tendency of downward <b>jumps</b> <b>and</b> co-jumps to be followed by increase in volatility <b>and</b> that upward <b>jumps</b> <b>and</b> co-jumps are followed by decrease in volatility. Finally, results for individual sectors reveal that estimated effects vary across industries - for cyclical sectors volatility is in general more sensitive to negative <b>jumps</b> <b>and</b> less sensitive to positive jumps than for defensive sectors...|$|R

5|$|While other bats {{have almost}} {{lost the ability}} to {{maneuver}} on land, vampire bats can walk, <b>jump,</b> <b>and</b> even run by using a unique, bounding gait, in which the forelimbs instead of the hindlimbs are recruited for force production, as the wings are much more powerful than the legs. This ability to run seems to have evolved independently within the bat lineage.|$|E

Toriyama created a short series, Neko Majin, that became a self-parody of Dragon Ball. First appearing in August 1999, the eight-chapter series was released sporadically in Weekly Shōnen <b>Jump</b> <b>and</b> Monthly Shōnen Jump until it was completed in 2005. These chapters were compiled into one kanzenban volume released on April 4, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Alto's Adventure is a 2015 endless runner snowboarding {{video game}} by Snowman. The player-character {{automatically}} {{moves to the}} right of the screen through procedurally generated landscapes. The player taps the screen to <b>jump</b> <b>and</b> perform tricks, and works towards goals, competitive high scores, and upgrades. Snowman, a Toronto-based, three-person indie development team, previously worked on productivity apps before Alto's Adventure. The game was made to emulate the ethereal atmosphere of snowboarding, and was inspired by Journey (2012), Monument Valley (2014), Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 (2000), and Windosill (2009).|$|E
5|$|Equestrian {{sports are}} among those contested at the Summer Olympic Games. Equine events began at the Olympics in 1900, when {{competitions}} in polo (considered by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to be a separate sport from the other equestrian events), vaulting, four-in-hand driving, mail coach driving, mixed hacks and hunters and three types of jumping (high jump, long <b>jump</b> <b>and</b> show-jumping) were held. Most of these events were later discontinued, although equestrian events have continued through the 2008 Summer Olympics, and now include team and individual dressage, three-day eventing and show-jumping. Competitors in the modern pentathlon event also have to complete an equestrian show-jumping course, {{but this is not}} part of the equestrian events.|$|E

He was regarded as the best athlete {{to come out of the}} draft and was the #1player on most draft boards. Johnson was said by ESPN to be able to be productive as a rookie, much like receiver Randy Moss was as a rookie.
