40|$|This study {{presents}} a linear stability analysis of thermal convection in a porous layer saturated with viscoelastic fluid subjected to harmonic vertical vibrations {{so that the}} gravity varies periodically with time. The fluid obeys an Oldroyd-B constitutive relationship. The porous layer {{is considered to be}} densely packed and to possess vertical anisotropy in both mechanical and thermal properties. The onset threshold in terms of correction to a critical Rayleigh number is computed using the regular perturbation method based on small amplitude of modulation. Due to the imposed gravity modulation, there is a shift in the onset criteria.

Experimentally, synaptic plasticity exhibits phases covering the induction of long-term potentiation and depression (LTP/LTD) during the early phase of synaptic plasticity, the setting of synaptic tags, a trigger process for protein synthesis, and a slow transition leading to synaptic consolidation during the late phase of synaptic plasticity. We present a mathematical model that describes these different phases of synaptic plasticity.
