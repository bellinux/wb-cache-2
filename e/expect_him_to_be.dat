25|$|In 2000, under Boras's supervision, {{high school}} {{prospect}} Landon Powell earned his GED following {{his junior year}} of high school and then filed the necessary paperwork to make him eligible for that year's draft. Powell went undrafted, since the major league teams did not <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> draft eligible, making him a free agent. Whether because of Powell's ability, his pricetag, or internal resentment within Major League Baseball about his successful end-run around the draft, Powell did not sign, instead enrolling at the University of South Carolina.|$|E
500|$|Loki tells Njörðr to [...] "stop" [...] and [...] "keep some moderation," [...] {{and that}} he [...] "won't {{keep it a secret}} any longer" [...] that Njörðr's son Freyr was {{produced}} with his unnamed sister, [...] "though you'd <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worse than he is." [...] The god Tyr then interjects and the flyting continues in turn.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Aulie was {{assigned}} to the Marlies after training camp with the Maple Leafs. [...] He was later called up to the NHL on November 12, 2010, when Dion Phaneuf was injured. Aulie played his first career NHL game the next day against the Vancouver Canucks, playing 12 games total with the Maple Leafs in his call-up before ultimately being returned to the Marlies. Despite the time he spent away from the AHL, Aulie was selected to the Western Conference team for the AHL All-Star Game. During the Skills Competition, Aulie competed in the hardest shot event, finishing third, with a top speed of 95.5mph. After the Maple Leafs traded defenceman François Beauchemin to the Anaheim Ducks, Aulie was called up to rejoin the team. Maple Leafs General Manager Brian Burke said {{one of the reasons for}} the trade was to open up a spot at the NHL level for Aulie: [...] "...as soon as we get a roster spot, we're calling up Keith Aulie. We <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> here for a while." [...] Aulie engaged in his first career NHL fight against Scott Hartnell of the Philadelphia Flyers, earning him the nickname [...] "Muhammad Aulie." [...] He scored his first career NHL goal against the New York Islanders on March 9, 2011.|$|E
60|$|Presently Izzy gave tongue. The {{management}} <b>expects</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> humorous {{on these}} occasions, {{so he did}} his best.|$|R
60|$|Nicholas looked on, quite {{amazed at}} the {{introduction}} of this new theme. Which seemed just what Mrs Nickleby had <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b>|$|R
60|$|Sadie was {{sometimes}} tactful, but her anger was quick, and she disliked {{to hear her}} husband use Western idioms. Moreover she <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> polite.|$|R
2500|$|Tochigiyama entered sumo in February 1911 but {{his coach}} Hitachiyama Taniemon didn't <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strong owing to his light weight. [...] However, he lost only 3 bouts {{on his way}} to the top makuuchi division, {{achieving}} promotion in January 1915. Tochigiyama defeated Tachiyama Mineemon, ending his series of 56 victories, on the 8th day of May 1916 tournament.|$|E
2500|$|Loki tells Njörðr to be silent, recalling Njörðr's {{status as}} once {{having been a}} hostage from the Vanir to the Æsir during the Æsir-Vanir War, that the [...] "daughters of Hymir" [...] once used Njörðr [...] "as a pisspot," [...] urinating in his mouth (an {{otherwise}} unattested comment). Njörðr responds that this was his reward when he was sent as a hostage to the Æsir, and that he fathered his son (Freyr), whom no one hates, and is considered a prince of the Æsir. Loki tells Njörðr to maintain his moderation, and that he won't keep it secret any longer that Njörðr fathered this son with his sister (unnamed), although one would <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worse than he turned out.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} band began its first tour {{in support of}} the album, Smith wrote an open letter to fans {{regarding}} his abuse of alcohol and prescription medications since the recording of Pretty. Odd. Although Smith joined the band for the first handful of dates, he left the tour to [...] "continue fighting addiction". Urie posted on the band's official website on August 7, 2013, that [...] "It's become evident that Spencer still needs more time to take care of himself. I can't <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fighting addiction one minute and be fully immersed in a national tour the next. With that said, the tour will continue without Spencer while he is away getting the help he needs." [...] Since Spencer's leave of absence, Dan Pawlovich of the band Valencia has filled in on tour.|$|E
6000|$|... "And what after that? Won't Bernard {{come to us}} to-night? I <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{standing}} on the door-steps waiting for us with his bride in his hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “My housekeeper’s nephew, {{who is a}} shoeing-smith in {{the mounted}} section of the Church Lads’ Brigade, and an {{authority}} on horseflesh, <b>expects</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> among the first three.” ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him quietly. He might have been someone she had never set eyes on, and yet from her {{composure}} she might have <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> standing there.|$|R
60|$|All {{the while}} he was {{dreading}} {{the moment when he}} would be alone with his wife and she would patiently <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ardent.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps I was,' {{she went}} on; 'but I did not <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so silly. Hareton, if I {{gave you a}} book, would you take it now? I'll try!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; {{no doubt}} it is better," [...] Millicent said carelessly. [...] "He has several friends in town, {{and of course we}} cannot <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> devoting himself to us." ...|$|E
60|$|Traddles {{shrugged his}} shoulders, {{and was not}} at all {{surprised}}. I had not <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> and was not surprised myself; or my observation of similar practical satires would have been but scanty. We arranged the time of our visit, and I wrote accordingly to Mr. Creakle that evening.|$|R
60|$|Sally {{stared at}} his {{vermilion}} profile in frank amazement. Ginger, she had realized by this time, {{was in many ways}} a surprising young man, but she had not <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as surprising as this.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where is 'e?" [...] {{repeated}} Mrs Potter, {{in a tone}} of indignation. [...] "Where {{would you}} <b>expect</b> <b>'im</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> but after mischief? 'E's at the mod'l, of course; always at it; never at hanythingk else a'most." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said his}} companion, thoughtfully, [...] "Shafton is {{certainly}} not poor, and he is almost everything any one could <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> As husbands go, I think he is eminently satisfactory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not she. His manners are {{all right}} enough. Besides, as he is a genius and a celebrity and all that, people dont <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> conventional. He might stand on his head, if he chose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] the {{inspector}} replied, unmoved. [...] "We have plenty that way. When a gentleman has as many aliases as Colonel Clay, {{you can hardly}} <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> over particular about having only one wife between them, can you?" ...|$|E
50|$|As {{the story}} passes, {{he was one}} of the pillars for the team and his {{presence}} is felt. Whenever he was injured, the team performance will fare badly because everyone <b>expects</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their main guy in defence.|$|R
50|$|After an {{investigation}} into the matter and Mirovich's refusal to name accomplices he was executed on 15 September, he remained so calm during his execution many <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pardoned, and the crowd gasped in shock when he was actually executed.|$|R
50|$|You board {{your ship}} and launch {{to destroy the}} asteroids. You <b>are</b> {{determined}} <b>to</b> save the base, even though the mission seems quite impossible. Soon after your launch Sir Dak Wyntol will launch to help you, though nobody <b>expects</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of any help.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, 'twas {{his native}} home, come to that; and where else could we <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be?</b> I don't care who the man is, snails and {{caterpillars}} always will lurk {{in close to}} the stump of cabbages in that tantalizing way." ...|$|E
6000|$|She started impatiently. [...] "You {{might have}} been more gallant, and found more {{difficulty}} in the selection," [...] she said, pertly. [...] "But since when have you gentlemen become so observant and so punctilious? Would you <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as considerate of others?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He escaped {{into the}} Albertine Mountain Range last night. It'll {{be hard to}} find him. We must <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loose for another forty-eight hours. It'll take that long for us to arrange the {{annihilation}} of the range area. Perhaps a trifle longer. And meanwhile--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Colville was astonished. [...] "The veglione {{has gone}} to your head, Mrs. Bowen," [...] he tacitly made his comment. She had spoken to Imogene, but she glanced {{at him as if}} she <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{grateful}} <b>to</b> her for this stroke of liberality.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometime last night--in camp--near our cabin," [...] replied Jim, {{quick as}} a flash. Manifestly {{he saw his}} {{opportunity}} [...] "He left Dandy Dale with me. Told us to take the stage this morning. I <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in it or to meet us." ...|$|R
2500|$|You {{could write}} a book every week on this club, it is ridiculous really. I am pretty gutted as he was the right man for the job. I {{thought it was a}} {{stepping}} stone for <b>him</b> but I <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> here longer than this." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was {{the next}} Sunday evening that I came into my room at a time I did not <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there, {{just as it was}} getting dark, that he seemed to feel some {{explanation}} due. [...] "This picture," [...] he said, [...] "it is so like my poor little chap." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sidney Feeder wondered. “Hasn’t {{she got a}} title too? What {{would she}} <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be?</b> President of the United States? He’s a man of real ability—he might have stood {{at the head of}} his profession. When I think of that I want to swear. What did his father want to go and make all that money for?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You think John of Buchan like to cosset you! You {{found the}} Black Douglas so courtly {{to me the}} other day as to <b>expect</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tender to this nicety of yours! Malcolm, as your prince and guardian, I forbid this folly, and command you to lay aside this fit of malice and do your devoir. What! sobbing, silly lad--where's your manhood?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Miss Weston, who now {{appeared}} close by. [...] "Since {{you seem}} to have heard a little about the matter, I feel I must say that my brother deliberately left us at a time when his father had <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of service <b>to</b> him." ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} that Gibson was not where others might have <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> During the briefing for the raid, he <b>was</b> advised <b>to</b> use an exit route that would put him over France. However, he disagreed and insisted he would return by the shortest route at low level.|$|R
50|$|Signed by the Hyundai Unicorns upon {{graduation}} from college in , Son entered the Korea Professional Baseball to high expectations, where many <b>expected</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the future ace of the Unicorns. He spent his rookie {{year as a}} full-time starting pitcher but went a disappointing 5-10 with a 5.43 ERA.|$|R
