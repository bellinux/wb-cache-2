For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al2O3 or silicates is a {{catalyst for}} the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230–270°C. Dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is conducted at 600–720°C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone. In the gas phase, glycol yields <b>glyoxal</b> and ethanol yields acetaldehyde, while organic amines are dehydrated to nitriles.|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen-containing heterocycles {{have great}} utility in the {{biomedical}} and medicinal fields and one such heterocycle is the 5 -membered pyrrolidine ring. The synthesis of pyrrolidine rings {{has been studied}} extensively with the routes relying on anodic oxidation, transition metals and dipolar cycloadditions with azomethine ylides. Previous work in the Waters group {{has been focused on}} new routes to azomethine ylides through a domino sequence. Through a thermal aza-Cope rearrangement followed by [3 + 2] dipolar cycloaddition the synthesis of a library of 2 -allyl pyrrolidines was accomplished. It was discovered that by using allylic amines and <b>glyoxals</b> at room temperature a cycloadduct was isolated bearing a 5 -vinyl moiety. The results were promising and {{the first part of the}} project was to optimize the reaction followed by substrate scope expansion to build a library of compounds. The new cycloadducts could not have been synthesized under traditional methods due to side reactivity difficulties and therefore this work circumvents the problems associated with the classical routes. This is the first report of azomethine ylides derived from allylic amines and <b>glyoxals</b> to date. Many cycloadducts were synthesized and they all contained the 5 -alkenyl group with many of them closely matching pyrrolidine containing natural products. The natural product, spirotryprostatin B, is an ideal target for featuring the developed methodology in total synthesis. Spirotryprostatin B was found to inhibit the G 2 /M phase in the cell replication pathway, suggesting a possible anti-cancer treatment. Using allylamine, ethyl glyoxylate, and appropriate dipolarophile under the optimized reaction conditions would afford a highly substituted cycloadduct that could be transformed into the final target. The core of the structure was synthesized in just three steps with only two steps requiring purification. The regio- and stereochemistry of the cycloadducts were analyzed using NOE enhancement and DFT studies to conclude that the [3 + 2] dipolar cycloaddition proceeded through the exo transition state. The total synthesis of the anti-cancer compound peducularine was also studied. Many different dipolarophiles were tested, but the ideal dipolarophile was not identified.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, an {{impressive}} array of C–H activation methodology has been developed for organic synthesis. However, due to the inherent inertness of the C–H bonds (e. g. ∼ 110 kcal mol− 1 for the cleavage of C(aryl) –H bonds) harsh reaction conditions have been realized to overcome high energetic transition states resulting in a limited substrate scope and functional group tolerance. Therefore, the development of mild C–H functionalization protocols is in high demand to exploit the full potential of the C–H activation strategy in the synthesis of a complex molecular framework. Although, electron-rich substrates undergo electrophilic metalation under relatively mild conditions, electron-deficient substrates proceed through a rate-limiting C–H insertion under forcing conditions at high temperature. In addition, a stoichiometric amount of toxic silver salt is frequently used in palladium catalysis to facilitate the C–H activation process which is not acceptable from the environmental and industrial standpoint. We report herein, a Pd(II) -catalyzed decarboxylative C–H acylation of 2 -arylpyridines with α-ketocarboxylic acids under mild conditions. The present protocol does not require stoichiometric silver(I) salts as additives and proceeds smoothly at ambient temperature. A novel decarbonylative C–H acylation reaction has also been accomplished using aryl <b>glyoxals</b> as acyl surrogates. Finally, a practical C–H acylation via a dehydrogenative pathway has been demonstrated using commercially available benzaldehydes and aqueous hydroperoxides. We also disclose that acetonitrile solvent is optimal for the acylation reaction at room temperature and has a prominent role in the reaction outcome. Control experiments suggest that the acylation reaction via decarboxylative, decarbonylative and dehydrogenative proceeds through a radical pathway. Thus we disclose a practical protocol for the sp 2 C–H acylation reaction...|$|R

A homozygous glx 3 null mutant in C. albicans strain SC 5314 displays greater sensitivity to millimolar levels of exogenous methylglyoxal, elevated levels of intracellular methylglyoxal, and carbon source-dependent growth defects, especially when grown on glycerol. These phenotypic defects are complemented by restoration of the wild-type GLX 3 locus. The growth defect of Glx 3 -deficient cells in glycerol is also partially complemented by added inorganic phosphate, which is not observed for wild-type or glucose-grown cells.

40|$|We {{have found}} a {{surprisingly}} informative decomposition of the complex question of smoggy ozone production (basically, [HO 2] in a more locally determined field of [NO]) {{in the process of}} linked investigations of modestly smoggy Eastern North America (by NASA aircraft, July 2004) and rather polluted Flushing, NYC (Queens College, July, 2001). In both rural and very polluted situations, we find that a simple contour graph parameterization of the local principal ozone production rate can be estimated using only the variables [NO] and j(sub rads) [HCHO]: Po(O 3) = c (j(sub rads) [HCHO]) (sup a) [HCHO](sup b). Here j(sub rads) is the photolysis of HCHO to radicals, presumably capturing many harder-UV photolytic processes and the principle ozone production is that due to HO 2; mechanisms suggest that ozone production due to RO 2 is closely correlated, often suggesting a limited range of different proportionality factors. The method immediately suggests a local interpretation for concepts of VOC limitation and NOx limitation. We believe that the product j(sub rads) [HCHO] guages the oxidation rate of observed VOC mixtures in a way that also provides [HO 2] useful for the principle ozone production rate k [HO 2] [NO], and indeed, all ozone chemical production. The success of the method suggests that dominant urban primary-HCHO sources may transition to secondary plume-HCHO sources in a convenient way. Are there other, simple, near-terminal oxidized VOC's which help guage ozone production and aerosol particle formation? Regarding particles, we report on, to the extent NASA Research resources allow, on appealing relationships between far-downwind (Atlantic PBL) HCHO and very fine aerosol (including sulfate. Since j(sub rads) [HCHO] provides a time-scale, we may understand distant-plume particle production in a more quantitative manner. Additionally we report on a statistical search in the nearer field for relationships between <b>glyoxals</b> (important near-terminal aromatic and isoprene reaction products) and aerosol production, looking for VOC's that might be most implicated. All three variables j(sub rads), [HCHO], and [NO] are relatively easily measured in widespread air pollution monitoring networks, and all are deducible form space-borne observations, though estimation of [NO] from [NO 2] (the species observable from space) may require care. We report also on airborne and surface observations of HCHO, suggesting that concentrated (urban) and more diffuse (forest) sources may be distinguishable from space. The use of the 3. 58 micron microwindow for HCHO remote sensing should allow much sharper resolution of HCHO than the UV. UV sensing requires large and expensive instruments, but even these seem justified since formaldehyde is so informative...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two parts, {{assessing}} marine and synthetic compounds active firstly against Plasmodium falciparum (Chapter 3 and 4) and secondly active against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, Chapter 5). In Chapter 3 the synthesis of nine new tricyclic podocarpanes (3. 203 - 3. 207 and 3. 209 - 3. 212) from the diterpene (+) -manool is described. Initial SAR study of synthetic podocarpanes concluded that the most active compound was a C- 13 phenyl substituted podocarpane (3. 204, IC₅₀ 6. 6 μM). By preparing analogues with varying halogenated substituents on the phenyl ring (3. 209 - 3. 212) the antiplasmodial activity was improved (IC₅₀ 1. 4 μM), while simultaneously decreasing the haemolysis previously reported for this class of compounds. Inspired by the antiplasmodial activity of Wright and Wattanapiromsakul’s tricycle marine isonitriles (2. 16 - 2. 21 and 2. 24 - 2. 27) an unsuccessfully attempt was made to convert tertiary alcohol moieties to isonitrile functionalities in compounds 3. 188, 3. 204 - 3. 207 and 3. 209 - 3. 212. Over a decade ago Wright et al. proposed a putative antiplasmodial mechanism of action for marine isonitriles (2. 4, 2. 9, 2. 15, 2. 19 and 2. 35) and isothiocyanate (2. 34) which involved interference in haem detoxification by P. falciparum thus inhibiting the growth of the parasite. In Chapter 4 we describe how we successfully managed to scale down Egan’s β-haematin inhibition assay for the analyses of small quantities of marine natural products as potential β-haematin inhibitors. Our modified assay revealed that the most active antiplasmodial marine isonitrile 2. 9 (IC₅₀ 13 nM) showed total β-haematin inhibition while 2. 15 (IC₅₀ 81 nM) and 2. 19 (IC₅₀ 31 nM) showed partial inhibition at three equivalents relative to haem. Using contempary molecular modelling techniques the charge on the isonitrile functionality was more accurately describe and the modified charge data sets was used to explore docking of marine isonitriles to haem using AutoDock. In Chapter 5 we describe how a lead South African marine bisindole MRSA pyruvate kinase inhibitor (5. 8) was discovered in collaboration with colleagues at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and how this discovery inspired us to design a synthetic route to the dibrominated bisindole, isobromotopsentin (5. 20) in an attempt to increase the bioactivity displayed by 5. 8. We devised a fast and high yielding synthetic route using microwave assited organic synthesis. We first tested this synthesis using simple aryl <b>glyoxals</b> (5. 27 - 5. 32) as precursors to synthesize biphenylimidazoles (5. 21 - 5. 26), which later allowed us to synthesize the ascidian natural product 5. 111. This method was sucessfully extended to the synthesis of deoxytopsentin (5. 33) from an N-Boc protected indole methyl ketone (5. 89). We subsequently were able to effectively remove the carbamate protection via thermal decomposition by heating the protected bisindole imidazole (5. 90) in a microwave reactor for 5 min under argon. The synthesis of 5. 20 resulted in an inseparable mixture of monoprotected and totally deprotected topsentin products, and due to time constraints {{we were not able to}} optimise this synthesis. Nonetheless our synthesis of the marine natural product 5. 33 which was faster and higher yielding than previously reported routes could be extended to the synthesis of other topsentin bisindoles (5. 138 - 5. 140). Work towards this goal continues in our laboratory. ...|$|R
