25|$|Studebaker's strong post-war {{management}} team including president Paul G Hoffman and Roy Cole (<b>vice-president,</b> <b>engineering)</b> {{had gone by}} 1949 {{and was replaced by}} more cautious executives who failed to meet the competitive challenge brought on by Henry Ford II and his Whiz Kids. Massive discounting in a price war between Ford and General Motors, which began with Ford's massive increase in production in the spring of 1953—part of Ford's postwar expansion program aimed at restoring it to the position of the largest car maker which GM had held since 1931—could not be equalled by the independent carmakers, for whom the only hope was seen as a merger of Studebaker, Packard, Hudson, and Nash into a third giant combine. This had been unsuccessfully attempted by George W. Mason. In this scheme, Studebaker had the disadvantage that its South Bend location would make centralization difficult. Its labor costs were also the highest in the industry.|$|R

He served as Chair of the Power System Operations Committee, Life Long Learning subcommittee, the Operating Economics Subcommittee and a member of the Awards Committee of PES. El-Hawary pioneered in many analytical and numerical computations to solve complicated problems of interconnected electric power systems that contains different types and technologies of generating machines, including: thermal, hydro, nuclear, solar, wind, tidal, and other renewable/sustainable/green energy resources. His research interests covered most of the fields of electric power engineering, including: power flow/optimal power flow, power system operation and operational planning, power system dynamic and control, power system protection and relaying, machinery design, smart grids and modern networks, renewable/sustainable/green energy, fuzzy systems and its applications, and artificial neural networks (ANNs) and its applications. All these achievements can be clearly seen in many cited works presented in the literature.|$|R
