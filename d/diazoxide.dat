25|$|Familial hyperinsulinism, {{linked to}} {{mutations}} in GLUD1, {{is characterized by}} hypoglycemia that ranges from severe neonatal-onset, difficult-to-manage disease to childhood-onset disease with mild symptoms and difficult-to-diagnose hypoglycemia. Neonatal-onset disease manifests within hours to two days after birth. Childhood-onset disease manifests during the first months or years of life. In the newborn period, presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, including seizures, hypotonia, poor feeding, and apnea. In severe cases, serum glucose concentrations are typically extremely low and thus easily recognized, whereas in milder cases, variable and mild hypoglycemia may make the diagnosis more difficult. Even within the same family, disease manifestations can range from mild to severe. Individuals with autosomal recessive familial hyperinsulinism, caused by mutations in either ABCC8 or KCNJ11 (FHI-KATP), tend to be large for gestational age and usually present with severe refractory hypoglycemia in the first 48 hours of life; affected infants usually respond only partially to diet or medical management (i.e., <b>diazoxide</b> therapy) and thus may require pancreatic resection. Individuals with autosomal dominant FHI-KATP tend to be appropriate for gestational age at birth, to present at approximately age one year (range: 2 days - 30 years), and to respond to diet and <b>diazoxide</b> therapy. Exceptions to both of these generalities have been reported. FHI-GCK, caused by mutations in GCK, may be much milder than FHI-KATP; however, some persons have severe, diazoxide-unresponsive hypoglycemia. FHI-HADH, caused by mutations in HADH, tends to be relatively mild, although severe cases have been reported. Individuals with FHI-HNF4A, caused by mutations in HNF4A, are typically born large for gestational age and have mild features that respond to <b>diazoxide</b> treatment. FHI-UCP2, caused by mutations in UCP2, is a rare cause of diazoxide-responsive FH1. Hyperammonemia/hyperinsulinism (HA/HI) is associated with mild-to-moderate hyperammonemia and with relatively mild, late-onset hypoglycemia; most but not all affected individuals have mutations in GLUD1.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{causes of}} {{hyperkalemia}} are discussed as follows. Acute digitalis overdose such as digoxin toxicity may cause hyperkalemia through the inhibition of sodium-potassium-ATPase pump. Massive blood transfusion can cause hyperkalemia in infants due to leakage of potassium {{out of the}} red blood cells during storage. Giving succinylcholine tn patients with conditions such as burns, trauma, infection, prolonged immobilisation can cause hyperkalemia due to widespread activation of acetylcholine receptors rather than a specific group of muscles. Arginine hydrochloride is used to treat refractory metabolic alkalosis. The arginine ions can enter cells and displace potassium out of the cells, causing hyperkalemia. Calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, <b>diazoxide,</b> and minoxidil can cause hyperkalemia. Box jellyfish venom can also cause hyperkalemia.|$|E

50|$|<b>Diazoxide</b> {{interferes with}} insulin release through its action on {{potassium}} channels. <b>Diazoxide</b> {{is one of}} the most potent openers of the K+ ATP channels present on the insulin producing beta cells of the pancreas. Opening these channels leads to hyperpolarization of cell membrane, a decrease in calcium influx, and a subsequently reduced release of insulin. This mechanism of action is the mirror opposite of that of Sulfonylureas, a class of medications used to increase insulin release in Type 2 Diabetics. Therefore, this medicine is not given to non-insulin dependent diabetic patients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diazoxide</b> also {{inhibits}} the secretion {{of insulin}} from the pancreas, {{thus it is}} used to counter hypoglycemia in disease states such as insulinoma (a tumor producing insulin) or congenital hyperinsulinism.|$|E
50|$|Hyperinsulinism due {{to diffuse}} overactivity of beta cells, {{such as in}} many of the forms of {{congenital}} hyperinsulinism, and more rarely in adults, can often be treated with <b>diazoxide</b> or a somatostatin analog called octreotide. <b>Diazoxide</b> is given by mouth, octreotide by injection or continuous subcutaneous pump infusion. When congenital hyperinsulinism is due to focal defects of the insulin-secretion mechanism, surgical removal of that part of the pancreas may cure the problem. In more severe cases of persistent congenital hyperinsulinism unresponsive to drugs, a near-total pancreatectomy may be needed to prevent continuing hypoglycemia. Even after pancreatectomy, continuous glucose may be needed in the form of gastric infusion of formula or dextrose.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diazoxide</b> (INN; {{brand name}} Proglycem) is a {{potassium}} channel activator, which causes local relaxation in smooth muscle by increasing membrane permeability to potassium ions.

For some time, the most common surgical procedure was removal of almost all of the pancreas, this cured some infants but not all. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus commonly develops, though in many cases it occurs many years after the pancreatectomy.Later it was discovered that a sizeable minority of cases of mutations were focal, involving overproduction of insulin by only a portion of the pancreas.

5000|$|Mutations in {{this gene}} cause {{one form of}} {{familial}} hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. [...] A deficiency is associated with 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency.

Among them are missense mutations (A40T, P258L, D57G, Y226H) and nonsense mutations (R236X) in the protein, and splicing mutations (261+1G>A, 710-2A>G) and some small deletions (587delC) in the cDNA. One mutation, 636+471G>T in the HADH gene, was shown to create a cryptic splice donor site and an out-of-frame pseudoexon. Most of the described cases have homozygous mutations. This disease has fairly homogenous clinical presentation across cases. The symptoms first appear in early life, between 1.5 hours post birth and 3 years of age, and the most common symptoms are hypoglycemia and seizures/convulsions directly related to the hypoglycemia. There are other clinical presentations that have been identified, namely: myoglobinuria, dicarboxylic aciduria, feeding difficulties in infancy, muscular hypotonia, hepatic steatosis, growth delay, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, hepatic necrosis, and fulminant hepatic failure. The disorder may be diagnosed by either the analysis of the molecular genetics of the individual, or by detection of abnormal metabolite levels in blood and/or plasma. Individuals with this deficiency have an elevated amount of 3-hydroxyglutarate excreted through the urine; a heightened level of C4-OH acylcarnitine in the blood plasma is also a characteristic of this FAO disorder.

40|$|Long term {{hyperglycemia}} impairs pancreatic ß-cell function.

Long term exposure of rat pancreatic islets to high glucose in vitro also resulted in a decreased glucose-induced insulin response, which could be prevented by previous exposure to <b>diazoxide.</b> The after-effect of <b>diazoxide</b> was not present after low glucose culture and not tightly coupled to its interaction with K+-ATP channels. Omitting Ca 2 + during cooling completely mimicked the effect of <b>diazoxide</b> indicating that <b>diazoxide</b> acts on both the level of Ca 2 + inflow and exocytosis. Also in human islets cultured at 27 mM glucose for 48 h previous <b>diazoxide</b> restituted a glucose-induced insulin response in final incubations. <b>Diazoxide</b> also protected against specific [Ca 2 +]i abnormalities seen after high glucose culture such as a rise in basal [Ca 2 +]i and a loss of slow oscillations. On the other hand, <b>diazoxide</b> did not restore a glucose-induced rise in [Ca 2 +]i. <b>Diazoxide</b> protected against over-stimulation also with regard to the adenylate cyclase-cAMP system. Exposing pancreatic islets from GK rats and GK hybrids to <b>diazoxide</b> increased intracellular insulin content.
