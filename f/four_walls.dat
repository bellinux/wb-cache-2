5|$|In shape, {{the palace}} complex is roughly {{rectangular}} {{and has a}} combined area of , surrounded by <b>four</b> <b>walls.</b> It is situated {{on the banks of}} the Chao Phraya River at the heart of the Rattanakosin Island, today in the Phra Nakhon District. The Grand Palace is bordered by Sanam Luang and Na Phra Lan Road to the north, Maharaj Road to the west, Sanamchai Road to the east and Thai Wang Road to the south.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Palace has twelve gates (ประตู, Pratu, {{literally}} a door), three along {{each of the}} <b>four</b> <b>walls.</b> These massive gates are built of brick and mortar and are topped with a Prang style spire. These gates are all painted in white, with gigantic red doors. Each of these outer gates were given rhyming names, starting from the north west in a clockwise direction around.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side of the temple {{courtyard}} is the Manjusri Hall (文殊殿). It was constructed in 1137 during the Jin dynasty and is roughly the same size as the East Hall, also measuring seven bays by four. It is located on an 83cm (2.7ft) high platform, has three front doors and one central back door, and features a single-eave hip gable roof. The interior of the hall has only four support pillars. In order to support the large roof, diagonal beams are used. On each of the <b>four</b> <b>walls</b> are murals of arhats painted in 1429 during the Ming dynasty.|$|E

5|$|The 1982 Shaw Brothers film Brothers {{from the}} Walled City {{is set in}} Kowloon Walled City. The 1984 gangster film Long Arm of the Law {{features}} the Walled City as a refuge for gang members before they are gunned down by police. In the 1988 film Bloodsport, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, the Walled City is the setting for a martial arts tournament. The 1992 non-narrative film Baraka features several highly detailed shots of the Walled City shortly before its demolition. The 1993 film Crime Story starring Jackie Chan was partly filmed in the deserted Walled City, and includes real scenes of building explosions. A walled neighbourhood called the Narrows in the 2005 film Batman Begins {{was inspired by the}} Walled City. The 2006 Hong Kong horror film Re-cycle features a decrepit, nightmarish version of the Walled City, complete with tortured souls from which the protagonist must flee. The 2016 TVB martial arts drama A Fist Within <b>Four</b> <b>Walls</b> takes place in the Triad-ridden Walled City in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The {{setting was}} principally based on Norway, and the {{cultural}} influences in the film come from Scandinavian culture. Several landmarks in Norway appear in the film, including the Akershus Fortress in Oslo, the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, and Bryggen in Bergen. Numerous other typical cultural Scandinavian elements are {{also included in the}} film, such as stave churches, trolls, Viking ships, a hot spring, Fjord horses, clothes, and food such as lutefisk. A maypole is also present in the film, as well as the brief appearance of runes in a book that Anna and Elsa's father opens to figure out where the trolls live. A scene where two men argue over whether to stack firewood bark up or bark down is a reference to the perennial Norwegian debate over how to stack firewood properly. The film also contains several elements specifically drawn from Sámi culture, such as the usage of reindeer for transportation and the equipment used to control these, clothing styles (the outfits of the ice cutters), and parts of the musical score. Decorations, such as those on the castle pillars and Kristoff's sled, are also in styles inspired by Sámi duodji decorations. During their field work in Norway, Disney's team, for inspiration, visited Rørosrein, a Sámi family-owned company in the village Plassje that produces reindeer meat and arranges tourist events. Arendelle was inspired by Nærøyfjord, a branch of Norway's longest fjord Sognefjorden, which has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site; while a castle in Oslo with beautiful hand-painted patterns on all <b>four</b> <b>walls</b> served as the inspiration for the kingdom's royal castle interior.|$|E

25|$|The elites of Tiwanaku lived inside <b>four</b> <b>walls</b> {{that were}} {{surrounded}} by a moat. This moat, some believe, was to create {{the image of a}} sacred island.

50|$|<b>Four</b> <b>wall</b> {{distribution}} has copyright implications; a film distributed through <b>four</b> <b>wall</b> distribution, and {{no other}} method, may classify as an unpublished work. Because of this, Deep Throat, a pornographic film distributed exclusively through four-wall distribution during its theatrical release, did not officially become published until it was released on home video over a decade later; had the film been distributed traditionally, it would have immediately lapsed into the public domain {{for lack of a}} copyright notice (such a notice has been included on all home video releases).|$|R

25|$|In his {{influential}} and meticulously annotated Latin {{edition of the}} works of Al-Haytam and Witelo Opticae thesauru (1572) German mathematician Friedrich Risner proposed a portable camera obscura drawing aid; a lightweight wooden hut with lenses in each of its <b>four</b> <b>walls</b> that would project images of the surroundings on a paper cube in the middle. The construction could be carried on two wooden poles. A very similar setup was illustrated in 1645 in Athanasius Kircher's influential book Ars Magna Lucis Et Umbrae.|$|E
25|$|In {{the outer}} yard {{surrounding}} Monas there are reliefs of Indonesian history.

The reliefs were made from molded cement although several of the statues are damaged and have decayed due to weathering.|$|E
25|$|On December 8, 2005, New York City {{authorities}} {{announced that}} builders {{working on the}} new South Ferry station had found {{the remains of a}} 200-year-old stone wall.

A portion of one wall was placed on temporary display inside Castle Clinton. In 2009, a long portion of wall was embedded permanently into the wall of the entrance to the newly constructed station, at the same depth below street level as originally discovered.|$|E

25|$|This is {{a mature}} {{work by the}} {{architect}} who retired in 1898. The nave and chancel are combined structurally into one space with <b>four</b> <b>walls,</b> one roof overall, and no columns or aisles. There is a basic porch leading into the nave on the north side. A combined lean-to {{on the south side}} houses the organ chamber and vestry, which share an arched opening into the chancel. The exterior combines a simple Victorian low church aspect using just the basics of Gothic Revival architecture. Thus, apart from two small crosses on the apexes of the roof and porch, there are only two other decorations: the shaped drip moulding over the west window, and the minimal moulding {{at the base of the}} porch archway.|$|E
25|$|There are <b>four</b> <b>walls</b> to a squash court. The front wall, {{on which}} three {{parallel}} lines are marked, {{has the largest}} playing surface, whilst the back wall, which typically contains {{the entrance to the}} court, has the smallest. The out line runs {{along the top of the}} front wall, descending along the side walls to the back wall. There are no other markings on the side or back walls. Shots struck above or touching the out line, on any wall, are out. The bottom line of the front wall marks the top of the 'tin', a half metre-high metal area which if struck means that the ball is out. In this way the tin can be seen as analogous to the net in other racket sports such as tennis. The middle line of the front wall is the service line and is only relevant during serves.|$|E
25|$|Installed on all <b>four</b> <b>walls</b> of {{the gallery}} to form a {{continuous}} horizon line, the 45 color images of Horn's installation Pi (1998) create a band of syncopated glimpses of another world. Identical in height, slightly varying in width (square, vertical rectangle, horizontal rectangle), evenly spaced and united by a certain blueness of tone, the photographs are portraits of a middle-aged man and woman; close-ups of stuffed animals and feather-strewn birds' nests; stills from Iceland's favorite television soap opera, The Guiding Light; and the beam of a lighthouse cutting through the night. There are also images of {{the interior of a}} plain house near the Arctic Circle; expanses of tundra, and of ground scattered with feathers in some instances and with stuffed dead birds in others. Finally, there are immense expanses of open edgeless sea, shown in different weather and at various times of day.|$|E
