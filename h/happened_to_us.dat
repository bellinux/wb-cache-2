The lads frequently did ask each other the question in the show's title, Whatever <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us?,</b> particularly during their more mellow moments in the pub.|$|E

I actually really like her and think she's wonderful. I think it's the best thing that's <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in a long time. She's a very intelligent woman but I don't see much to fear. I will say it is great to have a woman {{in charge of the}} country. She's very sensible and I think that's a good thing at this point in time".|$|E
500|$|Shakira {{released}} her first major-label studio album Pies Descalzos in 1995 by Sony Music and Columbia Records. Assuming a prominent position in its production, she co-wrote and co-produced {{each of the}} eleven tracks included on the record. Serviced as the lead single from the project in 1996, [...] "Estoy Aquí" [...] saw additional songwriting and production from Luis Fernando Ochoa. The track is heavily influenced by Latin pop elements, and makes use of prominent guitar instrumentation. Lyrically, it states a desire to amend a failed relationship. In English, the lyrics [...] "lo que nos pasó no repetirá jamás" [...] and [...] "Estoy aquí queriéndote, ahogándome" [...] translate to [...] "what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> will never be repeated" [...] and [...] "I'm here wanting you, drowning", respectively.|$|E

500|$|Sean Kinney {{said about}} the new album and the fans' mixed {{reactions}} about the band moving on after Staley's death: [...] "Look, it’s a big move to fucking stand up and move on. Some people, the music connected with them so strongly, their opinions, {{how they feel about}} it... It’s amazing that they have such a connection but they seem to act like it happened to them. This <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> and Layne’s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we’re okay with it, why can’t you be? This <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> this didn’t happen to you. But this album isn’t about that, it’s a bigger universal point. We’re all going to fucking die, we’re all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I’ve won." [...] "Sometimes people ask us, ‘Wouldn’t Layne have been pissed off that we did this?’ And I tell them {{it would have been the}} opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We’re not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I’m doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off." [...] And Cantrell added: [...] "We’ve toured around the world, we’ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can’t fucking replace, and then we’ve chosen by circumstance to get together again. That turned into ‘maybe we can fucking do this.’ And that turned into this".|$|E

"We {{said there}} was just no way they were getting {{into the end zone}} after they blocked that punt," [...] said Simpson (a college {{teammate}} of DuPree at Michigan State University) after the game. [...] We've come through too far and gone through too much. [...] Staubach went to the wide receivers twice before, and we figured he'd go to DuPree. [...] We both dove for him the moment Staubach threw. [...] I think I got a hand on the ball. [...] We had to play him tough. [...] Goddamn it was the whole season on one play. [...] That stuff <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> too much in the past. [...] We're going all the way this time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1970 Michigan team {{compiled}} a 9–1 record and was ranked #7 {{in the final}} Coaches Poll and #9 in the final AP Poll. The 1970 team was not permitted to accept a bowl invitation, as Big Ten policy prescribed that the Rose Bowl was the only bowl game in which a conference team could participate. In March 1971, Michigan coach Bo Schembechler launched a public campaign to change the Big Ten's restrictive bowl participation policy. He noted that lesser teams had played in major bowl games and said, [...] "It was a crime what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> last season. We were the greatest team in the country not {{to play in a}} bowl game." [...] The conference eventually rescinded its one-bowl policy in 1975.|$|E

2500|$|Mayo said, at {{the close}} of her Senate Committee testimony, [...] "I was burned by sexual abuse in the early 70’s; we’re being burned by the false {{accusation}} of it now. An internet lynch mob can go on forever, but the law should protect innocent people from legal charges they can’t defend, like those from the distant past. The current statute gives survivors sufficient time for litigation, and a lifetime to bring charges to criminal court. Survivors and non-survivors alike need legal protection. The law as it stands, does both. Until you’ve experienced your life ripped open by false accusations, please consider that what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> can happen to anyone. That puts this proposal squarely in the category of more-harm-than-good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tutu preached {{a message}} of {{forgiveness}} during a 1989 trip to Israel's Yad Vashem museum, saying [...] "Our Lord would {{say that in the}} end the positive thing that can come is the spirit of forgiving, not forgetting, but the spirit of saying: God, this <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> We pray for those who made it happen, help us to forgive them and help us so that we in our turn will not make others suffer." [...] Some found this statement offensive, with Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center calling it [...] "a gratuitous insult to Jews and victims of Nazism everywhere." [...] Tutu was subjected to racial slurs during this visit to Israel, with vandals writing [...] "Black Nazi pig" [...] {{on the walls of the}} St. George's Cathedral in East Jerusalem, where he was staying.|$|E
2500|$|In the January 29, 2007 {{issue of}} Newsweek, GOP activist Grover Norquist {{described}} how Rove {{showed up at}} a weekly meeting of influential D.C. conservatives early in the month, surprising attendees with his bubbly demeanor after weeks of rumors that he might be headed out. Norquist was quoted as saying [...] "I think some people had given him up for dead, but he was good old Karl, upbeat and enthusiastic." [...] At the meeting Rove previewed Bush's final two years in office, saying Social Security reform was likely off the table and that Iraq and the economy would be the biggest issues for 2008. [...] "I don't know anyone who holds him personally responsible for what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in the election", said a GOP national committee member, who declined to be named talking about the inner circle.

2500|$|As {{opposition}} leader, Livni {{noted in}} a 2009 Knesset speech that she herself did not support Yitzhak Rabin's policies at the time. [...] "The dispute is around {{the question of whether}} you can have it both ways—maintaining Israel as a Jewish state and keeping the entire Land of Israel," [...] she said. Political analysts see Livni's speech at the 2003 commemoration rally for Rabin as a turning point in her political career when she became more popular among the Israeli peace camp. She delivered a speech which many found deeply moving in which she said the day Rabin was murdered was [...] "the day that the skies fell down on me because of what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> to all the citizens of Israel." [...] As foreign minister, Livni would again attend the memorial for Rabin in 2009. Labor Party officials were not keen on this idea, fearing that her appearance would cost them votes. Some Kadima officials also seemed reluctant, fearing her appearance at left-wing event would send some votes Likud's way. Livni attended the memorial for Rabin in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|When Faith No More {{was brought}} up in a 1999 {{interview}} with The A.V. Club, Patton (then fronting Mr. Bungle) stated [...] "I'm definitely glad it's over: It was a great thing while it lasted, but it really had to end. I think if it had continued it would have gotten really ugly. No fistfights or bloody noses or anything like that, but the music would have been substandard. So the line must be drawn there." [...] In another interview from 2001, he similarly stated that the band had broken up [...] "because we were starting to make bad music." [...] However, Gould did not share the same sentiment as Patton {{on the quality of the}} band's late material, stating in 1998 [...] "However many records we sold or didn't, we maintained over a long [...] period of time a high standard of music that we're proud of, and we never sucked. Whatever shit that <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> on the way, thank God it didn't get in the way of the music." ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{an article}} in The New York Times: [...] "He [...] has been to more Army camps and played to more {{soldiers}} than any other entertainer. He has crossed the Atlantic by plane to take song and cheer to the troops in Britain and Northern Ireland. He has flown to the cold wastes of Alaska and the steaming forests of Trinidad. He has called at Dutch‑like Curaçao. Nearly every camp {{in this country has}} heard him sing and tell funny stories." [...] Some of the unusual hardships of performing to active troops were described in an article he wrote for Variety, in 1942: [...] "In order to entertain all the boys ... it became necessary for us to give shows in foxholes, gun emplacements, dugouts, to construction groups on military roads; in fact, any place where two or more soldiers were gathered together, it automatically became a Winter Garden for me and I would give a show." [...] After returning from a tour of overseas bases, the Regimental Hostess at one camp wrote to Jolson, [...] "Allow me to say on behalf of all the soldiers of the 33rd Infantry that you coming here is quite the most wonderful thing that has ever <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> and we think you're tops, not only as a performer, but as a person. We unanimously elect you Public Morale Lifter No. 1 of the U.S Army." ...|$|E
