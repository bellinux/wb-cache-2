The controller is the cruise control, the plant is the car, and the system is {{the car and the}} cruise control. The system output is the car's speed, and the control itself is the engine's throttle position which determines <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>power</b> the engine delivers.|$|E

This has led to numerous faults, as she is unable to feel <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>power</b> she is generating.

25|$|The 2005 Kenyan {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held on}} 21 November 2005. The main issue of contention in the Constitution review process was <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>power</b> should be vested in the Kenyan Presidency. In previous drafts, those who feared a concentration {{of power in the}} president added provisions for European-style power-sharing between a ceremonial President elected via universal suffrage and an executive Prime Minister elected by Parliament.

25|$|And third, each {{ship has}} {{a display of}} systems (a Ship Systems Display, or SSD) {{that acts as a}} {{schematic}} diagram of a particular ship in play. Each class in the game has an individualized SSD, and most expansions revolve around providing new classes and 'variants' of ships to the game, with new SSDs. These displays consist of check-off boxes for all the ship's structure and systems (shields in all six directions, systems and hull damage, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>power</b> the engines produce, how many transporters there are, etc. checked off when damaged) in the general layout of the ship, along with general reference information for that ship (tracks to check off use for weapons in limited supply like drones, shuttles, probes, plus weapons fire resolution tables, firing arcs, and miscellaneous ship data).|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{renewable}} power {{sources such as}} wind and solar, geothermal energy is dispatchable, meaning that it is both available whenever needed, and can quickly adjust output to match demand. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), {{of all types of}} new electrical generation plants, geothermal generators have the highest capacity factor, a measure of <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>power</b> a facility actually generates as a percent of its maximum capacity. The EIA rates new geothermal plants as having a 92% capacity factor, comparable to those of nuclear (90%), and higher than gas (87%), or coal (85%), and much higher than those of intermittent sources such as onshore wind (34%) or solar photovoltaic (25%). While the carrier medium for geothermal electricity (water) must be properly managed, the source of geothermal energy, the Earth's heat, will be available, for most intents and purposes, indefinitely.|$|E

25|$|Liberal {{or republican}} ideas were and would {{continue}} to be embraced by creoles outside the Mexico City elite. These came out of Bourbon reforms in Europe that were based on the Enlightenment. Attacks on the Church by liberals in Spain and elsewhere in Europe would be repeated in Mexico during the La Reforma period. Ideals of the Constitution of Cadiz would find expression in the 1824 Constitution of Mexico. An interesting fact is that this constitution would influence political thought {{on both sides of the}} Mexican political spectrum, with even Iturbide bending to it when he created the first congress of an independent Mexico. After Iturbide, there was wide general consensus, even among the landed elite, that some form of representative government was needed. The question was <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>power</b> would be in legislative hands and how much in an executive.|$|E
25|$|Immediately after Dušan's death (20 December 1355), {{his wife}} Empress Helena {{was found in}} Serres. She started to exert her {{imperial}} control on the region. This surely was against the goals of Vojihna, which would later on trigger armed conflicts. How the Empress ended up in Serres and started to rule it is unknown, it exists sources saying {{she was in the}} region staying away from the harsh winter in the north, just when her husband died. As she was energetic and smart (although not so talented), she might have foreseen the crumbling of the Empire, and sought to rule this region. If this version is correct, Vojihna and his son-in-law Uglješa Mrnjavčević (the son of Vukašin Mrnjavčević) were obliged to work for her as they had done to Dušan, although as the future will tell; with less enthusiasm and fidelity. It is not known <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>power</b> Vojihna had in the Serres province, although he most likely had the ambitions of putting it under his control.|$|E
25|$|Heraclitus {{was born}} to an aristocratic family in Ephesus, in the Persian Empire, {{in what is now}} called present-day Efes, Turkey. His father was named either Blosôn or Herakôn. Diogenes says that he abdicated the kingship (basileia) in favor of his brother and Strabo {{confirms}} that there was a ruling family in Ephesus descended from the Ionian founder, Androclus, which still kept the title and could sit in the chief seat at the games, as well as a few other privileges. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>power</b> the king had is another question. Ephesus {{had been part of the}} Persian Empire since 547 and was ruled by a satrap, a more distant figure, as the Great King allowed the Ionians considerable autonomy. Diogenes says that Heraclitus used to play knucklebones with the youths in the temple of Artemis and when asked to start making laws he refused saying that the constitution (politeia) was ponêra, which can mean either that it was fundamentally wrong or that he considered it toilsome. Two extant letters between Heraclitus and Darius I, quoted by Diogenes, are undoubtedly later forgeries.|$|E
