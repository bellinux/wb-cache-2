5|$|Most of {{his family}} {{appear to have been}} thieves. While young, his brother, Richard, was small <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>age</b> and {{is said to have been}} carried around in a basket on a friend's back; in a crowd, Richard would snatch the hats and wigs of passers-by. Richard later took to other forms of {{criminal}} activity and ended up hanged at Tyburn in 1707 for the burglary of a house in Stepney.|$|E
5|$|The three Miller boys played Australian rules {{football}} {{in winter and}} cricket in summer. Their {{father had been a}} successful local cricketer and taught the boys to play with an orthodox and classical technique, relying on a solid defence and concentration in the mould of Bill Ponsford. At the age of seven, Miller's family moved to Elsternwick, in Melbourne's south east. As a child, Miller was small <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>age,</b> which forced him to develop his technique rather than rely on power, something that held him in good stead for the future.|$|E
5|$|At the New South Wales Championships in January 1997, Thorpe's time of 3min 59.43s in the 400m {{was eight}} seconds faster than his {{previous}} personal best; {{it made him}} the first 14-year-old to cover the distance {{in less than four}} minutes on Australian soil. Ranked fourth for the event countrywide, Thorpe went into the Australian Championships in Adelaide as a serious contender for selection in the national team for the 1997 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. With a top-three finish and a specific qualifying time required for selection, Thorpe focused on the 400m freestyle after injuries to world record holder Kieren Perkins and Daniel Kowalski; both had won Olympic medals in the event. Thorpe went on to win bronze behind 16-year-old Queenslander Grant Hackett, setting a new personal best of 3min 53.44s. The time was a world record <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>age</b> group and the race was the first of many battles with Hackett.|$|E
50|$|In 1891 Brown {{returned}} to Swanton {{so he could}} care <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>aged</b> parents, and he continued to reside there after their deaths.|$|R

50|$|After the war, Hendricks {{returned}} to Indiana to care <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>aging</b> parents. During this period, he co-hosted Toast and Coffee, {{one of the}} first interracial radio programs in the US, though most listeners were unaware he was black.|$|R
5|$|Glencross {{was born}} December 28, 1982, in Kindersley, Saskatchewan, but {{grew up in}} Provost, Alberta. He {{is the son of}} Mel and Robin Glencross, and has a younger brother, Matthew, and sister, Kari. His parents both played hockey and say he {{inherited}} an intense competitive nature from them. His family moved to Red Deer, Alberta when he was a teenager as his parents began a livestock auction business. Glencross was small <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>age,</b> standing less than five feet tall when he was15, and as a result was often left off the top teams in minor hockey despite having the talent to play; he played Midget C hockey in Provost. He experienced a rapid growth spurt, growing a full foot in a period of 17months, and was recruited to play Junior A hockey for the expansion Brooks Bandits of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL) in 2000. He {{went on to become the}} first Bandit alumnus to play in the National Hockey League (NHL), and his number 17 was retired by the team in 2011.|$|E
5|$|His wife {{of nearly}} half a century, Elizabeth, to whom {{he had not been}} faithful, died in 1971. Brundage had once jested that his {{ambition}} was to wed a German princess. In June 1973, this came to pass when he married Princess Mariann Charlotte Katharina Stefanie von Reuss (1936–2003), daughter of HeinrichXXXVII, Prince of Reuss-Köstritz. Von Reuss had worked as an interpreter during the Munich Games; she stated that she had met Brundage in 1955, when she was 19. When Brundage was asked by reporters about the 48-year difference in their ages, Brundage responded that he was young <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>age</b> and she mature for hers, and instead of 85 years to 37, it should be thought of as more like 55 to 46. Ruegsegger refused to be best man and stated after Brundage's death that the couple had dissipated much of Brundage's fortune through free spending, though Guttmann notes that some of those purchases were of real estate, which could be deemed investments.|$|E
5|$|In a {{prototype}} from the series, Edward was an eighteen-year-old teenager travelling alongside his father whose soul sealed in a flying squirrel. Edward's prototype {{had an average}} height, but retained his automail. In order to fit with the readers from the manga magazine Monthly Shonen Gangan, Edward's traits were further modified, leaving his current one. His height was reduced in order to contrast with Alphonse's huge armor. In {{the design of the}} character, Arakawa is often worried about not making his automail too bulky to avoid balancing it by increasing Edward's muscles, making his appearance unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>age.</b> She has also often drawn the character in full body length, but at one point noticed she made it too tall. As the manga continued serialization, Arakawa found that she drew Edward half naked several times even more than Alex Louis Armstrong who tends to show his torso. While stating that this was because she wanted to draw Edward's automail, she commented that it was common for men to walk in underwear at their homes.|$|E
5000|$|Non-humans {{are also}} {{known to have}} [...] "stunt doubles". For example, Enzo was the stunt double <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>aging</b> sire Moose on the sitcom Frasier. Soccer, the dog who portrayed Wishbone, {{reportedly}} hated swimming and therefore had stunt doubles.|$|R
50|$|Meirion Pennar {{lived in}} Llandysul, Adpar, and Newcastle Emlyn, during which period {{he had a}} son. He {{returned}} in 2000 to Swansea to care <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>ageing</b> mother and younger brother, Geraint. It was here that he died on 9 December 2010.|$|R

5|$|Shadrick {{enrolled}} in Pineville High School in 1947 and received top marks in his classes. During {{his sophomore year}} in 1948, he developed an interest in football and made the school's team, though he was small <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>age.</b> The team could not afford uniforms, and Shadrick's father gave him five dollars to buy one, but it was stolen from his locker in October 1948. The incident upset Shadrick so much {{he dropped out of}} school, reportedly refusing to return from that day forward. One month later, he and a friend enlisted in the U.S. Army. Shadrick's father would later refer to the stolen school uniform as the reason Shadrick enlisted in the military, and said he felt it indirectly caused his son's death.|$|E
5|$|Watts {{was born}} to Janine and Andrew Watts on 26 March 1991 in Victoria, Australia. He proved himself as an adept Australian rules footballer {{at a young age}} when he {{represented}} Victoria at the under-12 AFL carnival. An equally talented basketball player, he represented both Victoria and Australia as a junior, earning a scholarship with the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). In 2007, he was rewarded with a second scholarship with the AIS, this time for football, as part of the eleventh intake of the AIS-AFL Academy. He missed playing in the 2007 AFL under-16 championships for Victoria Metro and most of the basketball season after he broke his collarbone twice. Despite attempting to play both basketball and football at an elite level, he ultimately gave up his basketball scholarship with the AIS in mid-2008 to focus on a football career; at the time, he was considered the best point guard <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>age</b> in Victoria and potentially the best in the country.|$|E

50|$|Like Preston Watson, the Dundee {{pioneer of}} flight, Lindsay possessed neither the will nor the sheer ruthlessness {{to promote his}} {{innovations}} as effectively as he might. A deeply religious and humane person, he refused the offer of a post at the British Museum {{so that he could}} care <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>aged</b> mother.|$|R

Ross was exonerated and put {{in command of the}} 34th Foot in Montreal in August, 1786. The regiment returned to England in 1787.|$|R
60|$|An {{explanation}} was forthcoming {{in the shape}} of a letter from her mother, who casually mentioned that Mr. Bartholomew Miller had gone away to the other side of Shottsford-Forum to be married to a thriving dairyman's daughter that he knew there. His chief motive, it was reported, had been less one of love than a wish to provide a companion <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>aged</b> mother.|$|R

She subsequently made clear her intention to vote for Barack Obama, and urged other young people to vote.|$|E
25|$|In 1872, {{his father}} {{arranged}} for him, age 16, to study medicine at Guy's Hospital. Apparently shy and appearing young even <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>age,</b> William initially had some troubles with fellow students, but they rapidly recognized his exceptional abilities. Soon, he was persuaded {{to switch to}} surgery, however, a surer career than medicine. Later, he received the degrees bachelor of medicine and master of surgery from the University of London.|$|E
50|$|However, {{mental age}} varies {{according}} to what kind of intelligence is measured. A child's intellectual age can be average <b>for</b> <b>his</b> physical <b>age</b> but the same child's emotional intelligence can be immature <b>for</b> <b>his</b> physical <b>age.</b> In this psychologists often remark girls are more emotionally mature than boys in the tween years. Also a six-year-old child intellectually gifted in Piaget terms, can remain a three-year-old child in terms of emotional maturity. Mental age was once considered a controversial concept.|$|R
50|$|Tony {{details the}} stress of caring <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>aging</b> mother, Livia, who is relentlessly pessimistic and cynical, at once {{demanding}} and resentful of assistance.

25|$|Governor Phillip was vested with {{complete}} {{authority over the}} inhabitants of the colony. Enlightened <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>age,</b> Phillip's personal intent was to establish harmonious relations with local Aboriginal people and try to reform as well as discipline the convicts of the colony. Phillip and several of his officers—most notably Watkin Tench—left behind journals and accounts of which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Often Phillip's officers despaired for the future of Sydney. Early efforts at agriculture were fraught and supplies from overseas were scarce.|$|E
25|$|He played {{baseball}} and football at Western Hills High School. Although Rose was small <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>age,</b> he earned the starting running back position on his freshman football team. When {{he was not}} promoted to the varsity football team in his sophomore year, Rose was dejected and soon lost interest in his studies. At {{the end of the}} school year, Rose's teachers decreed he would have to attend summer school or be held back. His father decided it would be better for Pete to repeat a year of school than miss a summer playing baseball. It would also give Pete an extra year to mature physically.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Remington {{was away}} at war {{during most of}} the first four years of his son's life. After the war, he moved his family to Bloomington, Illinois for a brief time and was {{appointed}} editor of the Bloomington Republican, but the family returned to Canton in 1867. Remington was the only child of the marriage, and received constant attention and approval. He was an active child, large and strong <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>age,</b> who loved to hunt, swim, ride, and go camping. He was a poor student though, particularly in math, which did not bode well for his father's ambitions for his son to attend West Point. He began to make drawings and sketches of soldiers and cowboys at an early age.|$|E

He led a recording in 1977, named Crossings, which reunited him with Philly Joe Jones, and he teamed up with world-class bassist Ron Carter. His later work tended to sound more modern and less polished than his better known recordings. He continued recording until his death {{from a heart attack}} on April 23, 1984 at the age of 60.|$|R
