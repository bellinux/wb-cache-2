40|$|Drilling Resistance Measurement (DRM) is {{recognised}} as {{an important}} on-site micro-invasive procedure for assessment of construction materials. This paper presents a detailed investigation of user-controlled variables and their influence on drilling resistance. The study proves that the ratio of penetration rate/rotational speed (PR/RPM) is proportional to drilling resistance. Data from Bath stone and an artificial reference stone demonstrates how different materials can be compared using their intrinsic specific energy. It is also shown that adjusting drilling settings does not significantly change drilling measurement variability. However, settings producing high drilling resistance can significantly contribute to drill bit wear. A theoretical framework in which tests can be optimised without compromising the ability to compare data is presented. The framework is of high significance to the conservation industry and will promote a more effective use of DRM. DRM is a minimally invasive procedure particularly appropriate for sensitive heritage structures. Its use can provide the essential mechanical property <b>data</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> <b>evaluation</b> of surface consolidation products and specification of repair materials...|$|E

Out of these, digital photoelasticity and digital image correlation (DIC) have evolved as the most preferred techniques for the evaluation of fracture parameters. The present study attempts to evaluate SIF’s for different specimen configurations using digital photoelasticity and DIC. For photoelastic determination of SIF’s, an over-deterministic nonlinear least square approach has been used. Isochromatic fringe order has been evaluated over the entire model domain by using ten-step method. Using the techniques of digital image processing, <b>data</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> <b>evaluation</b> of SIF’s has been collected in an automated manner. The methodology has been applied for the extraction of SIF’s for two different specimen configurations, single edge notched (SEN) panel and interacting parallel edge cracked panel.

For the estimation of mixed-mode SIF’s using DIC, required displacement data has been obtained using 3 D-DIC. Using this data as an input, over-deterministic nonlinear least square approach has been implemented in modified form for reliable and better convergence of solution. For this purpose, MATLAB program has been written. In order to ensure the sufficiency of number of parameters, displacement field has been reconstructed theoretically to compare it with the experimentally obtained displacement distribution.

40|$|D. Ed. During {{the past}} few years the {{teaching}} of mathematics has been characterized by a move away from the traditional teaching methods. With a view to improving the effectiveness of teaching and learning mathematics, the emphasis has shifted from the product to the process. The mathematical skills that need to be developed in pupils include strategies for the solving of real problems. This represents a shift from the application of mathematics to solve problems to problem solving as a teaching method. The application of a problemcentred approach in the teaching of mathematics has given rise to a need for instruments that will facilitate multidimensional assessment. This requires the revision, adaptation and expansion of the structure of existing assessment techniques. A need was identified for the formulation of clear guidelines for the assessment of pupils' mathematical competericies. Data obtained from relevant literature and from questionnaires designed {{for the purpose of this}} study were used to compile guidelines for the assessment and evaluation of mathematics pupils. New assessment methods make new demands on the designers and users of assessment instruments, and the assessment of pupils' problem solving skills make high demands on mathematics teachers. It requires a thorough knowledge of, and insight into how pupils learn mathematics. The teacher is a facilitator, a catalyst and a provider of information who teaches pupils the language of mathematics by teaching them the necessary terminology and symbolism. Because of the diversity that is present in the way pupils respond, the assessment of their problem-solving ability is a complex process. It is therefore very important that mathematics teachers be equipped with extensive assessment skills. Assessment is a complete reporting on the knowledge of the pupils; it is the tool employed to measure progress. It describes the present situation by collecting the <b>data</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Evaluation can be defined as the awarding of a value to progress made and conclusions arrived at on the basis of the total body of information collected. Every single facet that influences the pupils' achievement in mathematics must be assessed in order to form a complete image of their mathematical abilities. It is therefore essential to assess both cognitive and the affective facets. To ensure the reliability of the data collected with a view to assessment, a variety of assessment techniques need to be employed. Any report on the pupils' demonstration of the achievement of the desired outcomes must be more comprehensive than a single mark or symbol. Separate reports must be compiled in respect of cognitive progress and affective aspects. Pupils should receive clear guidelines on what the expected outcomes are, and on how and when assessment will be conducted. Criteria for monitoring the standard of assess. - ment must be formulated by the teacher, whose duty it is to inform the pupils fully on these. Validity and reliability are important considerations in testing. Assessment serves to emphasize the most important mathematics to be learned. The choice of assessment techniques is extremely important. A policy of continuous assessment ensures that the final decision is not based on the result of a single examination. However, promotion or the awarding of credits must be based on more than the result of a continuous formative assessment. Summative final examination assessment place the final stamp on knowledge, without which it would have been impossible to conduct an evaluation...|$|E

Result of land evaluation in the study area by using the existing criteria of land suitability of maize indicated the same class of land suitability of S 3 and therefore not suited to the field condition.

E-government involves many aspects of public administration ranging from introducing new technology to business process (re-) engineering.

A number of limitations of current measurement instruments are identified. Measurement focuses predominantly on the front (primarily counting the number of services offered) and not on the back-office processes. Interpretation of measures is difficult as all existing measurement instruments lack a framework depicting the relationships between the indicators and the use of resources. The different measures may fit the aim of the owners of the e-governmental services, however, due to conflicting aims and priorities little agreement exists on a uniform set of measures, needed for comparison of e-government development.

The present investigation was conducted over an area of approximately 700 Km 2 in northeastern Brazil at JAICO and its environs located in the south of the Piaui state. A Raster based Computer Mapping System-ERDAS (Earth Resources Data Analysis System) for a hybridized unsupervised-supervised classification (Maximum Likelihood) approach was used in order to extract of 17 land use/land cover classes at the Level II of Anderson Classification (USGS, 1976). These classes were recoded in order to detect the 11 soil association classes in accordance with the Brazilian and USDA Systems (Brazil, 1983 and USDA, 1975, 1983), which were then recoded into 9 land capability units using the Brazilian and American Systems (USDA, 1966, 1983 and Brazili, 1971, 1983).

40|$|Biological soil crusts occur {{extensively}} in semi-arid regions. In {{the western part}} of Niger, they are associated with various types of physical soil crusts in fallows and in the "tiger bush ecosystem" (a landscape with a typical banded pattern consisting of densely vegetated bands of small trees and shrubs alternating with bare soil bands). Despite their widespread occurrence, not much research has been done regarding their role on runoff generation in the Sahelian environment. The present study aims at: (i) highlighting the relative contribution of biological soil crusts in infiltration and runoff on crusted soil in respect with other soil factors; (ii) assessing the impact of underlying physical crusts associated {{with a wide range of}} microbial cover; and (iii) gathering the <b>data</b> <b>required</b> <b>for</b> an <b>evaluation</b> of the potential of microbial cover in water redistribution in an arid environment and for modelling purposes. The study was based on runoff measurements performed in situ at the level of ten plots, 1 m(2) each, under two simulated rain-falls. Those experiments were coupled with the visual characterization and image analysis of soil surface conditions as well as micromorphological examinations, using a light microscope, both on the field and at the laboratory. Visual estimation of crust cover was found consistent with the estimation based on the image analysis. Biological soil crusts capped the summit of pre-existing physical soil crusts, i. e. structural crusts, formed in situ by the impact of water drop and erosion crusts, resulting from water or wind erosion of structural crusts. The percentage of microbial cover in the 1 -m(2) plots range from 39 to 80 % (55 % in average) on structural crusts compared to 4 to 29 % (17 % in average) on erosion crusts. Runoff coefficient varied with both the level of microbial cover and the type of physical soil crust. Higher runoff coefficients were found where biological soil crusts had developed on erosion crusts as compared to structural crusts. Runoff coefficients recorded from erosion crusts increased with the level of microbial cover while negative correlations were found on structural crusts. They show that the clogging effect of microbial cover for the plasmic layer of erosion crusts is higher than that of the sand layer of structural crusts. Separating biological soil crusts according to the types of the underlying physical crusts explain, therefore, the contradictory findings related to their role on infiltration and runoff generation. Those data will help to evaluate the potential role of biological soil crusts in the modelling of water redistribution in the arid environment of {{the western part of}} Niger...|$|R

Study found {{that it was possible to}} use Medicare Australia database to estimate costs of HIV healthcare claimed through the Medicare Benefits Schedule. Chapter 3 describes original study measuring health-related utility in people living with HIV in era of effective antiretrovirals. Australian utility instrument (AQoL) was used for first time in HIV in a sample drawn from existing cohort with available clinical and surrogate data. AQoL was reasonably acceptable for use in sub-set of cohort of HIV patients, but low correlation in scores was seen with different health states associated with HIV.

This {{is especially true for}} behaviors that cannot adequately be studied under controlled conditions due to legal or ethical reasons (i. e. distraction, fatigue). The large scale database enables researchers on the one hand to describe normal driving behavior {{and on the other hand}} to identify accidents and critical driving events and their prevalence in traffic. BASt and FAT jointly follow the vision of a continuous naturalistic driving study in Germany supplementing established accident data bases and therefore improving knowledge about accident causation. This database could ultimately improve the development and evaluation of vehicle-, infrastructure and behavior based road safety measures. The status of two studies that were designed to build the methodological as well as technical basis for a German NDS will be presented. From the methodological side the calculation of risk measures quantifying the additional risk of critical driving events under certain conditions is a basic feature of NDS (bad weather, phoning, etc.). In order to assess prevalence and risk data, a reasonable unit of evaluation must be defined. Neither whole trips nor one- or more-minute episodes are appropriate for the underlying questions. The segmentation of a trip in well- distinguished driving maneuvers as homogeneous action units in traffic provides both, a good and compact description of a trip itself, and a basic unit to calculate prevalence and risk measures of certain critical driving events. The prevalence of critical driving events within the car-following maneuver for different conditions will be reported. On the technical side, an ongoing pilot study pursues the objective to define and establish the processes of data acquisition, data management and data evaluation providing a basis for large-scale NDS. Especially the data acquisition system (DAS) and the data management will be presented. This includes mainly the design of the DAS, the <b>required</b> <b>data</b> <b>for</b> further <b>evaluations,</b> and regarding the database the process for saving and analysing data. Furthermore, first results of an exemplary evaluation of when and how the participants of the study are distracted during their driving tasks will be shown. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the research work performed for designing, developing and testing a new laser test and training range for the Italian Air Force. This includes {{the design of}} new range instrumentation and facilities, development of innovative methods for military systems performance prediction/evaluation and determination of eye-safety requirements for employment of ground and airborne laser systems at the laser range (during both experimental and training activities), and extensive laboratory, ground and flight test activities with state-of-the-art ground/airborne laser systems and laser guided weapons. Between 1997 and 1998 the Italian Air Force Official Flight Test Centre (ItAF-OTC) set the requirements for upgrading the PISQ test/training range (Poligono Interforze del Salto di Quirra - Sardinia - Italy), adding new facilities for carrying out safe training and experimental activities with airborne and ground laser systems, together with LOW delivery tests. According to these initial requirements, the PILASTER (PISQ LASer Test and Evaluation Range) research and development program was divided in two different phases. The aim of {{the first phase of}} the program (1999 - 2002) was to provide an initial operational capability for carrying out, in fully safe conditions, ground tests and flight experimental activities (with related measurements and semi-automated <b>data</b> analysis), <b>required</b> <b>for</b> performance <b>evaluation</b> of military laser systems. The successive phase of the program (still ongoing) is aimed to implementing the PILASTER full operational capability, <b>required</b> <b>for</b> performing all laser test/training activities, including all mission planning and fully-automatedpost-mission data analysistasks (2002 - 2004). Implementation of suitable mathematical models for laser systems performance analysis (i. e., atmospheric propagation, mission geometry, target back-scattering, etc.) is an essential requirement of the PILASTER program, due to the need for 'realistic' simulation and mission planning, together with reliable post-mission data analysis at the vi range. Very important is also the definition of eye-safety criteria and procedures, since most of current laser systems operate in the near infrared, with considerable risk for the naked human eye. In this research, present laser technology status and future technology trends are investigated, with particular emphasis for the systems now in service or under development for the Italian Air Force. These include the Thompson Convertible Laser Designation Pod (CLDP), The ELOP Portable Laser Designator (PLD) system, Laser Guided Bombs (e. g., PAVEWAY 11, PAVEWAY III and Lizard), and the Marconi- Selenia Laser Obstacle Avoidance System (LOAS) for helicopters. Furthermore, suitable mathematical models for ground/airborne laser systems performance analysis and mission planning are presented, together with innovative methods for evaluating the hazards associated with the use of ground and airborne laser systems at the PILASTER range. Particularly, after describing the technical requirements and design characteristics of the PILASTER range instrumentation, safety issues of state-of-the-art ground/airborne laser systems are thoroughly investigated, in order to identify operational procedures and limitations for the safe employment of such equipment at the PILASTER range during execution of both test and training missions. Furthermore, various mathematical algorithms are presented, developed for the PILASTER simulation and mission planning tools, that allow a complete verification of laser-safety for ground and airborne laser systems. Extensive laboratory, ground and flight experimental activities is performed with both ground and airborne laser systems in order to test the various PILASTER laser range systems and to validate/refine the models developed for systems performance analysis and simulation. Furthermore, the LOAS system is tested both on the ground and in flight, in order to assess the system obstacle detection performance in various weather conditions, and the efficiency of the algorithms developed for obstacle classification and trajectory optimisation.
