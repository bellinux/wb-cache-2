Government programs suggest more efficient water use {{and this is the}} advantage that drip irrigation systems have. In the latter, the water travels from the pumping station through a pipe network directly to the roots of plants. The core of the drip irrigation systems are laterals (pipes) with installed drippers, through which, the water passes slowly to plants. The design of the irrigation system requires knowledge of water management, hydraulics, agronomy and related sciences. This thesis describes technical and technological basis for the design of drip irrigation system, legislation and the necessary permits for small-scale irrigation system. For considered arable land, irrigation system has been designed. All needed information, input data and bases have been collected. Analyses of water resource abundance and hydraulic calculations of network pipelines and associated elements were made and criteria for the selection of individual elements of the irrigation system are described. In addition to the design, crop water requirements for the first growing season are calculated. Calculations and <b>indicative</b> <b>timetables</b> were implemented with CROPWAT 8. 0 software...|$|R
