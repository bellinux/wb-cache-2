40|$|The marked {{inhibition}} of cytochrome oxidase activity in brain homogenates shown by 2, 4, 6 -trimethoxy- 0 -phenethylamine {{and the corresponding}} triethoxy compound (1) prompted investigation {{of the effect of}} substitution of methyl and ethyl for methoxy and ethoxy respectively in the 0 -phenethylamine molecule. Trimethyl- and 2, 4, 6 -triethyl-p-phenethylamine were obtained by chloromethyla-tion of mesitylene and 1, 3, 5 -triethylbenzene respectively to give the correspond-ing benzyl chlorides (2), which then gave the trialkylphenylacetonitriles upon treatment with sodium cyanide (3); the resulting nitriles were reduced by means of lithium aluminum hydride, and the corresponding 6 -phenethylamines formed were isolated as their hydrochlorides. 3, 4 -Dihydroxy- 5 -methoxy-p-phenethylamine (I) was of interst both as a partially demethylated mescaline and as a possible precursor of 7 -methoxy- 2, 3 -dehydro- 5, 6 -indoloquinone (II), an analog of adrenochrome (IV); the latter substance has been reported to have marked <b>hallucinatory</b> <b>activity</b> a t concentra-tions much lower than mescaline (4 - 6).

40|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} {{among the}} most invalidating and distressing experiences reported by patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, leading to feelings of powerlessness and helplessness towards their illness. In more severe cases, these auditory hallucinations can {{take the form of}} commanding voices, which are often related to high suicidality rates in these patients. Several authors propose that the meanings attributed to the hallucinatory experience, rather than characteristics like form and content, can be determinant in patients’ reactions to <b>hallucinatory</b> <b>activity,</b> particularly in the case of voice-hearing experiences. In this study, patients diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia presenting auditory hallucinations were studied. Multiple regression analyses were computed to study the influence of several developmental aspects, such as family and social dynamics, bullying, depression, and sociocognitive variables on the auditory hallucinations, on patients’ attributions and relationships with their voices, and on the resulting invalidation of hallucinatory experience. Overall, results showed how relationships with voices can mirror several aspects of interpersonal relationship with others, and how self-schemas, depression and actual social relationships help shaping the voice-hearing experience. Early experiences of victimization and submission help predict the attributions of omnipotence of the voices, and increased hostility from parents seems to increase the malevolence of the voices, suggesting that socio-cognitive factors can significantly contribute to the etiology and maintenance of auditory hallucinations. The understanding of the characteristics of auditory hallucinations and the relationships patients established with their voices can allow the development of more promising therapeutic interventions that can be more effective in decreasing invalidation caused by this devastating mental illness. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

5000|$|In one study, {{researchers}} sought physiological {{correlates of}} lucid dreaming. They {{showed that the}} unusual combination of <b>hallucinatory</b> dream <b>activity</b> and wake-like reflective awareness and agentive control experienced in lucid dreams is paralleled by significant changes in electrophysiology. Participants were recorded using 19-channel Electroencephalography (EEG), and 3 achieved lucidity in the experiment. Differences between REM sleep and lucid dreaming were most prominent in the 40-Hz frequency band. The increase in 40-Hz power was especially strong at frontolateral and frontal sites. Their findings include the indication that 40-Hz activity holds a functional role in the modulation of conscious awareness across different conscious states. Furthermore, they termed lucid dreaming as a [...] state, or that lucidity occurs in a state with features of both REM sleep and waking. In order to move from non-lucid REM sleep dreaming to lucid REM sleep dreaming, {{there must be a}} shift in brain activity in the direction of waking.Other well-known contributing scholars involved with lucid dream research and consciousness, yet primarily based in fields such as psychology and philosophy include: ...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} study, Becker and Elliott [Becker, C., & Elliott, M. A. (2006). Flicker induced color and form: Interdependencies and {{relation}} to stimulation frequency and phase. Consciousness & Cognition, 15 (1), 175 - 196] described {{the appearance of}} subjective experiences of color and form induced by stimulation with intermittent light. While there have been electroencephalographic studies of similar <b>hallucinatory</b> forms, brain <b>activity</b> accompanying the appearance of hallucinatory colors was never measured. Using a priming procedure where observers were required to indicate the presence of one of eight target colors we compared electrophysiological correlates of hallucinatory color with brain states associated with other visual phenomena. Different target colors were accompanied by different patterns of EEG activation. However, in general, {{we found that the}} appearance of hallucinatory colors is preceded by a power decrease in the lower alpha band alongside an increase in gamma band frequencies. We argue that decreasing activity in the lower alpha band acts as a gating mechanism, inducing a switch in perception between different colors. The increasing gamma activation may correlate with the formation of a coherent conscious percept...|$|R
40|$|College {{students}} were administered the Imaginal Processes Inventory {{and were asked}} to record their nocturnal dreams in a diary. The dreams of students selected as representing extremely different styles of waking fantasy according to the Imaginal Processes Inventory were analyzed with regard to bizarreness, emotionality, emotional polarity, and variety of content. Significant differences in the dream structure were found among subjects of differing daydream styles. Findings support the psychological significance of the concept of daydreaming styles and suggest parameters of cognition that transcend state of consciousness. Dreams, daydreams, and related subjective phenomena have proven fruitful areas for experimental research over the past two decades. One issue requiring further exploration is the relationship of nocturnal dream activity to spontaneous waking fantasy. Do these internal fantasy experiences serve identical functions? How are they related structurally? Do they express similar contents? One model by which to relate daydreaming and nocturnal dreaming is that of "alternative channels. " That is, whatever is rendered inaccessible to conscious fantasy seeks expression in night dreams. Thema and affects dominating an individual's waking fantasy, then, would be quite different from the contents of his dream life. The work of Cartwright (1972) suggests that such an inverse relationship may even exist with regard to the structural characteristics of daydreams and nocturnal dreams. That is, an upsurge of bizarre, <b>hallucinatory</b> <b>activity</b> in waking mentation appears to be accompanied by a reduction of such activity during rapid-eyemovement (REM) -period dreams and vice versa. A second theoretical model characterizes dreaming and daydreaming as analagous or parallel processes located at different ends of an arousal continuum. In this case thematic, affective, and structural characteristics of the two phenomena would be positively rather than inversely related. A third possibility is that dreams and daydreams are rela...|$|E
40|$|Trabajo presentado al 28 th CINP World Congress of Neuropsychopharmacology celebrado en Estocolmo del 3 al 7 de junio de 2012. Non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate {{receptor}} (NMDA-R) antagonists are extensively used as pharmacological {{models of}} schizophrenia {{due to their}} ability to evoke schizophrenia symptoms including hallucinations- in healthy individuals and to aggravate them in schizophrenic patients, Likewise, 5 -HT 2 A receptor agonists including natural (psylocibin, mescaline, 5 -MeO-DMT, etc.) and synthetic compounds (e. g., LSD, DOI,DOB, etc.) display a strong <b>hallucinatory</b> <b>activity.</b> The systemic administration of the non-competitive NMDA-R antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) to anesthetized rats induced a marked disruption of the activity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), increasing and decreasing the activity of 45 % and 33 % of the pyramidal neurons recorded, respectively (22 % of the neurons were unaffected). Concurrently, PCP markedly reduced slow cortical oscillations (1 Hz) as assessed by recording local field potentials (Kargieman et al., 2007). Similar observations {{have been reported in the}} mediodorsal and centromedial nuclei of the thalamus, reciprocally connected with the PFC (Santana et al., 2011). The increased activity of excitatory neurons is accompanied by a marked expression of the immediate early gene c-fos in thalamocortical networks (Kargieman et al., 2007; Santana et al., 2011). Likewise, the administration of the 5 -HT 2 A receptor agonist DOI increased and decreased, respectively, the activity of 40 % and 30 % of pyramidal neurons in PFC, in parallel with a marked reduction of slow cortical oscillations (Celada et al., 2008). These effects are also shared by the natural hallucinogen 5 -MeODMT (Riga et al., this congress). The subsequent administration of the antipsychotic drugs haloperidol and clozapine reversed the effects of PCP and DOI, indicating that the disrupted activity of thalamocortical networks is intimately related with the pro-psychotic activity of these agents. Moreover, the reversal of PCP- and 5 -HT 2 A agonistinduced loss of slow cortical oscillations can be a useful experimental model in the search of new antipsychotic drugs. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
