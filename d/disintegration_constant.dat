40|$|The {{role of the}} {{moisture}} content and particle size (PS) on the disintegration of complex organic matter during the wet anaerobic digestion (AD) process was investigated. A range of total solids (TS) from 5 % to 11. 3 % and PS from 0. 25 to 15 mm was evaluated using carrot waste as model complex organic matter. The experimental {{results showed that the}} methane production rate decreased with higher TS and PS. A modified version of the AD model no. 1 for complex organic substrates was used to model the experimental data. The simulations showed a decrease of the disintegration rate constants with increasing TS and PS. The results of the biomethanation tests were used to calibrate and validate the applied model. In particular, the values of the <b>disintegration</b> <b>constant</b> for various TS and PS were determined. The simulations showed good agreement between the numerical and observed data...|$|E
40|$|The {{disintegration}} of recovered paper {{is the first}} operation {{in the preparation of}} recycled pulp. It is known that the defibering process follows a first order kinetics from which it is possible to obtain the disintegration kinetic constant (KD) by means of different ways. The <b>disintegration</b> <b>constant</b> can be obtained from the Somerville index results (%ISV) and from the dissipated energy per volume unit (SS). The %ISV is related to the quantity of non-defibrated paper, as a measure of the non-disintegrated fiber residual (percentage of flakes), which is expressed in disintegration time units. In this work, disintegration kinetics from recycled coated paper has been evaluated, working at 20 rev/s rotor speed and for different fiber consistency (6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 %). The results showed that the values of experimental disintegration kinetic constant, KD, through the analysis of Somerville index, as function of time, increased with the disintegration consistency. Therefore, as consistency increased, the disintegration time was drastically reduced. The calculation of the disintegration kinetic constant (modeled KD), extracted from the Rayleigh’s dissipation function, showed a good correlation with the experimental values using the evolution of the Somerville index or with the dissipated energy...|$|E

40|$|This work {{is aimed}} {{to assess the}} methane {{potential}} production of a mixture of three waste that come from a food industry plant with a capacity of treating vegetables of about 12, 000 t/y and an annual waste production of 400 t. For the above-mentioned purpose, tests in semi-pilot (batch, 6 L-reactors) and pilot (semi-continuous, 300 L-reactor, hydraulic retention time, HRT = 30 d) scale in mesophilic conditions were carried out. The mixture of organic waste subjected to tests had a total solid (TS) content of about 10 % b. w. (by weight), a VS/TS ratio of 0. 9, a C/N ratio of 15 and a <b>disintegration</b> rate <b>constant</b> of 0. 382 d- 1. Semi-pilot scale tests returned a specific biogas production of 0. 55 Nm 3 /kg VS (VS, volatile solid), with an average methane content of 53 % b. v. (by volume). On the other hand, the specific biogas production from the pilot scale test set up at 0. 503 Nm 3 /kg VS with a methane content of only 44 % b. v. The high residual VS content detected in the digestate coming from the test in semi-continuous mode (about 35 %) leads to assume that better results could have been obtained using longer HRTs or a more efficient mixing syste...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Scintigraphic {{studies have}} been {{performed}} to assess the release, both in vitro and in vivo, of radiotracers from tablet formulations. Four different tracers with differing physicochemical characteristics have been evaluated to assess their suitability as models for drug delivery. Methods In-vitro disintegration and dissolution {{studies have been}} performed at pH 1, 4 and 7. In-vivo studies have been performed by scintigraphic imaging in healthy volunteers. Two hydrophilic tracers, (99 m Tc-DTPA) and (99 m Tc-MDP), and two lipophilic tracers, (99 m Tc-ECD) and (99 m Tc-MIBI), were used as drug models. Results Dissolution and disintegration profiles, differed depending on the drug model chosen. In vitro dissolution velocity constants indicated a probable retention of the radiotracer in the formulation. In vivo <b>disintegration</b> velocity <b>constants</b> showed important variability for each radiopharmaceutical. Pearson statistical test showed no correlation between in vitro drug release, and in vivo behaviour, for 99 m Tc-DTPA, 99 m Tc-ECD and 99 m Tc-MIBI. High correlation coefficients were found for 99 m Tc-MDP not only for in vitro dissolution and disintegration studies but also for in vivo scintigraphic studies. Conclusion Scintigraphic studies have made {{a significant contribution to}} the development of drug delivery systems. It is essential, however, to choose the appropriate radiotracers as models of drug behaviour. This study has demonstrated significant differences in release patterns, depending on the model chosen. It is likely that each formulation would require the development of a specific model, rather than being able to use a generic drug model {{on the basis of its}} physicochemical characteristics. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to theoretically investigate the influence of drug release properties, characterized by the disintegration of a solid dosage form and dissolution of drug particles, on the systemic exposure of highly soluble drugs in immediate release products. An absorption model was developed by considering disintegration of a solid dosage form, dissolution of drug particles, gastrointestinal transit flow, and intestinal absorption processes. The absorption model was linked to a conventional pharmacokinetic model to evaluate the effect of disintegration and dissolution on the peak exposure (Cmax) and total exposure of area under the curve (AUC). Numerical methods were used to solve the model equations. The simulations show that the effect of disintegration of a dosage form and dissolution of drug particles depend on the permeability of a drug, with a low-permeability drug having a greater effect. To provide similar exposure to an oral solution formulation, a solid dosage form containing a low-permeability drug would need to dissolve more rapidly than a solid dosage form containing a high-permeability drug. It was shown theoretically for poorly permeable drugs that the <b>disintegration</b> rate <b>constant</b> has to be greater than 9 hour− 1 (equivalent to approximately 90 % in 30 minutes) to make both AUC and Cmax ratios higher than. 9, ensuring the confidence interval of. 80 to 1. 25. The rapid in vitro release requirement of at least 85 % dissolved in 30 minutes is sufficient for highly soluble and highly permeable drugs. However, for highly soluble and poorly permeable drugs, the appropriate in vitro release requirement seems to be 90 % dissolved in 30 minutes...|$|R
40|$|At first sight, {{looking at}} Rilkeâs Duineser Elegien and Sonette an Orpheus when {{thinking}} of utopian, dystopian or heterotopian spaces represented in literature seems an unlikely choice. It is Die Aufzeichnungen des Malte Laurids Brigge which immediately {{lend themselves to}} an analysis within this paradigm, with its highly subjective description of a metropolis, with a narrator who is constantly, simultaneously {{in the past and}} in the present, with a <b>constant</b> <b>disintegration</b> of space and the I, which could be read as an ultimate study in Foucauldian heterotropes. And, I am sure, an interesting article could be written with this focus, perhaps culminating in a series of direct pointed questions: Is Malte himself actually alive as the âIâ that narrates the text? Or, is this rather the perspective of a revenant, who can pass easily through walls and time while making up plausible excuses why, in the entire text, nobody directly addresses him, so that he himself could just as well be invisible to the other characters in the text? But this will not be my undertaking in this article...|$|R
40|$|The article {{contains}} the considerations on the interpersonal conflict between an educator and a pupil {{as a basic}} element {{of the process of}} education. The reflection are {{based on the assumption that}} education is a „sui generis" type of a conflict of interests. The said process consists in the educator's persistent interference in the pupil's personality, in its <b>constant</b> <b>disintegration</b> resulting from the educator's confronting the pupil with the tasks and problems to be solved and then in its gradual integration through the fact that the pupil has solved the problems or performed the tasks. In order to investigate the above process, the author distinguishes several concepts forming a general scheme of the analysis. Among basic concepts the author includes: 1) the intensity of a conflict (5 stages have been distinguished); 2) the awareness of a conflict; 3) symmetrical and asymetrical character of interpersonal conflict relations; 4) general and more detailed forms of struggle, including criteria 1) and 3); 5) the functions of conflicts; 6) the elimination and termination of a conflict. The {{article contains}} the considerations on: a) a conflict as a basic factor of the development of personality; b) main stages of conflict, together with the analyses of forms of struggle and the means of eliminating conflicts, as models of educational situations; c) two main ways in which the conflicts appear, as dichotomic models of educational actions; d) three types of education, as the functions of different educational attitudes adopted in a situation of conflict.

60|$|Peduncle.--The {{membrane}} of the peduncle is thin; {{the whole}} surface is sparingly and quite irregularly studded with minute, much-branched filaments (Pl. IV, fig. 3, highly magnified); these are occasionally {{as much as}} l/5th of an inch in length; the degree of branching varies much, but is generally highly complex; the ordinary diameter of the branches is about 1/200th of an inch; their tips are rounded, and even a little enlarged, and frequently torn off, {{as if they had}} been attached to or buried in the flesh of the shark, in which the whole peduncle is imbedded. These filaments are formed of, and are continuous with the external transparent membrane of the peduncle, and they contain, up to the tips of every sub-branch, a hollow thread of corium, prolonged from the layer internally coating the whole peduncle. In all other Lepadidæ, the peduncle increases in length, chiefly at the summit where joined to the capitulum, and in diameter, throughout nearly its whole length, except close to the base; but, owing to the <b>constant</b> <b>disintegration</b> of the outer surface, the old outside coat does not split in defined lines, like the membrane of the capitulum. In Anelasma, however, owing to the imbedded position of the peduncle, the old outer coats are preserved, the lines in which they have split during continued growth being thus exhibited: those in the uppermost part almost symmetrically surround the peduncle, showing that here, as in other Lepadidæ, has been one regular line of growth; but in the lower part the lines are extremely irregular; and what is almost unique, it appears that the blunt basal end is constantly increasing in length and breadth, and, apparently, at a greater rate than any other part. I judge of this latter fact, from the whole bottom of the peduncle being covered with numerous curved, or nearly circular, lines of natural splitting, the nature of which can be best understood by examining the much-enlarged drawing (Pl. IV, fig. 3) of a small portion (taken by chance) of the membrane of the base, seen from the outside, and bearing some of the simplest branched filaments: other branches, as may be seen, have been cut off. This manner of growth explains the broad, blunt basal termination of the peduncle, so unlike that in other Lepadidæ. New membrane is formed, not continuously as in other cases, under the whole surface of the old membrane, but in irregular patches; thus the portion marked (a) runs under (b), but not under the little circles (c, c), for these are the last-formed portions and underlie the membrane (a) and (b). I do not understand how the splitting of the old membrane is effected; but no doubt it is by the same process by which the membrane of the capitulum in other genera, as in Scalpellum, splits symmetrically between the several valves. In the branched filaments it is particularly difficult to understand their growth, for it is not possible, after examining them, to doubt that they continue to increase, and send off sub-branches, which it would appear probable, penetrate the shark's flesh like roots. I may remark that one, or more commonly two or three branched filaments stand nearly in the centre of each circular line of exuviation or splitting. The branched filaments first commence as mere little pustules, and these appear to be most numerous at the bottom of the peduncle.|$|R
