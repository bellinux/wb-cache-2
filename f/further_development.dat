5|$|Seeking better {{performance}} and fulfilment of the Air Ministry Specification E.38/46, Sydney Camm designed the Hawker P.1052, which {{was essentially a}} Sea Hawk outfitted with a 35-degree swept wing. Performing its first flight in 1948, the P.1052 demonstrated good performance and conducted several carrier trials, but was ultimately determined to not warrant <b>further</b> <b>development</b> into a production aircraft. As a private venture, Hawker proceeded to convert the second P.1052 prototype into the Hawker P.1081 with swept tailplanes, a revised fuselage, and a single jet exhaust at the rear. On 19June1950, the P.1081 conducted its maiden flight, and was promising enough to draw interest from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF); however, <b>further</b> <b>development</b> was stalled by difficulties with the engine's reheat. In 1951, the sole P.1081 prototype was lost in a crash.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Kim {{originated}} from a weak tropical disturbance that formed {{to the northeast}} of Truk on October 9. Over the next few days, the disturbance persisted while moving west; however, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initially expected the disturbance to dissipate over the southern Philippines without <b>further</b> <b>development.</b> On October14, the disturbance became less organized over the Sulu Sea, only {{to move into the}} South China Sea the next day, where the disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression by the JTWC. By this time, the monsoon trough was well developed in the South China Sea and provided a favorable environment aloft for <b>further</b> <b>development.</b> At 18:00UTC on October15, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system.|$|E

5|$|After the {{cancellation}} of WS-120A, the Air Force made no <b>further</b> <b>development</b> of new ICBMs until 1972. In that year the M-X project was begun, {{which resulted in the}} development of the LGM-118 Peacekeeper. The Peacekeeper entered service in the mid-1980s and served until 2005; the Minuteman III is still in service, and has outlasted both of its planned replacements.|$|E
5|$|As for {{its earlier}} productions, Century 21 {{launched}} {{a number of}} merchandising campaigns based on Joe 90, which included toy cars and comic strips featuring the continuing adventures of Joe McClaine. The series was syndicated in the United States in 1969, re-broadcast in the UK during the 1990s and released on DVD in most regions in the 2000s. The idea of a live-action film adaptation of Joe 90 has been considered more than once since the 1960s, but without <b>further</b> <b>development.</b>|$|E
5|$|At first, the {{depression}} slowly tracked westward {{because it was}} blocked by a ridge of high pressure to the north. The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance, and {{the depression}} remained poorly organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July. The organization of the system hindered <b>further</b> <b>development</b> despite favorable conditions with low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Late on July 29, the system began to execute a turn to the northwest {{with an increase in}} forward speed. It still remained a poorly organized tropical depression south of Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the six-lane {{motorway}} {{began in}} 1977, initially as the Zagreb bypass, then {{continued in the}} 1980s as {{an expansion of the}} existing two-lane road between Zagreb and Belgrade.

Construction of the entire route was completed in 2006; <b>further</b> <b>development</b> entails new exits, new rest areas and the reconstruction of the existing motorway. The construction cost of the A3 motorway is estimated at 7 billionCroatian kuna (approximately 958.9 millioneuro).|$|E
5|$|Development {{started in}} early 2010 {{with the goals}} of {{reworking}} the character Falco Lombardi to mechanically play like he did in Melee and increasing the accessibility of the gameplay style, but the project quickly evolved to a full-scale reworking of Brawl.
