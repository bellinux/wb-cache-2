In {{the last}} decade or so, there has been a very clear {{transition}} in many countries throughout the world from a <b>graphical</b> <b>cadastre</b> and/or relatively non-accurate digital cadastre toward an accurate coordinate based legal cadastre. Aiming at defining accurately the turning points position of the cadastral sub-division based on current data without the need to re-measure the cadastral entities, motivates the development of new algorithms and approaches suitable to performing the task. Implementation on a nationwide level requires to first develop advanced mathematical algorithms and methods to process separate parcellations (cadastral blocks or mutation plans), and then additional algorithms and methods to combine the numerous separate parcellations into a cadastral continuity maintaining rigid topological compatibility. Practical experience, especially from the Israeli viewpoint, indicates that implementation of advanced computational technique...|$|E
40|$|The {{contents}} of scanned and vectorized cadastral plans {{have to be}} transferred to a modern reference frame often. Knowing that the situation within existing reference frames and networks are not homogenous a one- step transformation leads seldom to acceptable results. Regional transformations do not fit together too and lead to a ‘mosaic ’ of locally fitting transformation areas. In the gaps an inhomogeneous situation is the result. A satisfactory solution was therefore defined by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (SFIT) Zurich and SWISSTOPO Berne with the affine transformation within finite triangles (finite element- FINELTRA). This method was applied in case of the renewal of the <b>graphical</b> <b>cadastre</b> in Kosovo. The paper shows the principle of the method, the work flow and approach as well as experiences with borderline effects and accuracies. Finally there are given some hints for the practical application...|$|E
40|$|As in {{many other}} countries, the {{existing}} statutory division of land- the cadastre – in Israel is based on filed surveying which were recorded during decades in field books and {{were used to determine}} the boundaries of the block and parcels. Cadastral measurement is a continuous process, due to changes in land ownership, union and division of parcels, and the constant necessity to redefine and update the ownership boundaries. Most information is currently kept on paper (field books, field sheets), which does not permit its computerized management. Inherent contradictions and inaccuracies in the existing material cause difficulties in its use and delays in tracking and measuring the changes, and in updating the cadastral map. The result of urban and regional planning which is carried out based on the non-precise <b>graphical</b> <b>cadastre</b> are non-precise plans which cause difficulties in preparing the mutation plans and thus very long processes of registration the ownerships of the land re-parcelation. The solution for the problems of the current cadastre which has a "graphic nature " is to establish an analytical cadastre in which the location of each entity is unequivocally determined precisely by the state plane coordinate system. The data of the analytical cadastre will thus constitute a spatial information system defining the statutory land division. Modern real estat...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} research dealing with geodetic and cadastral aspects of utilizing space {{above and below}} the surface. The research is being conducted at the Geodetic Engineering Division of the Technion- Israel Institute of Technology, as part of the doctoral studies of the first author. The principal objectives of the research are to find a cadastralgeodetic solution for utilizing above and below surface space and for defining the characteristics of the future analytical, three-dimensional and multilayer cadastre that will replace the existing two-dimensional <b>graphical</b> surface <b>cadastre</b> in Israel. The research objectives are being realized by attaining the secondary research objectives: defining the future cadastral reality and developing a multilayer cadastral model; defining guidelines for transition from the surface cadastre to the multilayer cadastre; developing a model for registering property rights in all three spaces; developing models for managing multilayer cadastre information and creating the geodetic-cadastral background for a legal solution of utilizing all land space...|$|R

S. system, with the introduction of altimetric information, would enable the possibility to use the cadastral data-base as basic support for the development of GIS at local scale. Some problems would arise if the uncertainty connected to coordinates of fiducial points is not overcome, with the consequent risk of invalidating all the updating process. In a first phase, this study refers to some experiences in compliance to new realized dispositions, with the aim to contribute in using of cadastral archives, indispensable for property definition and correct territory management. As the current cadastre systems are based on 2 D parcels, the physical 3 D objects cannot be defined as cadastral objects and there are limitations in representing the complex internal structure of the buildings on geometric and thematic dimensions in the 3 D entity levels. In the last phase, this paper contains some reflections on 3 D cadastre, with the aims of analysing the current Italian situation and seeking to define some recommendations regarding future developments in three-dimensional and spatial cadastre, that will replace the existing two-dimensional <b>graphical</b> surface <b>cadastre.</b> TS 6 – 3 D Cadastr...|$|R
40|$|In the {{graduation}} thesis, {{the preparation of}} a cadastral report {{in the context of}} the construction of public infrastructure with the study case of the project »Regulation of railroad crossings on the section Pragersko–Hodoš under reconstruction and electrification of rail line Pragersko–Hodoš« is presented. The content of project documentation is laid down by the legislation, but specific requirements related to the individual project, particularly in the public procurement, are identified by the investor in the terms of reference (ToR). A cadastral report is not a mandatory part of the content of the construction project documentation. However, a project investor needs data on parcels affected by planned project and the request for the preparation of a cadastral report is usually made in the ToR. A cadastral report with the data about affected land parcels as well as data about planned spatial intervention is, among the other, used for the determination of planned land acquisition and establishment of easements on real properties. Cadastral data and project designer data with planned spatial interventions and utility infrastructure, serve as the basis for the preparation of a cadastral report. The first part of the thesis is reserved for the presentation of the legislation that is required in the formulation of such a project, followed by the summary of basic concepts of the land cadastre. For the study case, the most common errors i. e. uncertainties of the land <b>cadastre</b> <b>graphical</b> subsystem that must be eliminated are presented and discussed. For such a project, the assessment of the positional accuracy of land cadastral data is needed, drawing attention to possible deviations in nature. In the conclusion, the preparation processes and the content of cadastral report for the chosen project are presented. Additionally, the following land subdivisions based on the cadastral report are presented for the study case...|$|R
40|$|Cadastral {{projects}} in Turkey have been accelerated {{in recent years}} by the involvement of the private sector. These projects aim at completing the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s cadastre, along with producing bases in standards that could be a foundation for Land Registry and Cadastre Information System (LRCIS). It is possible to produce cadastral data with todayÃ¢Â€Â™s technological means. In this context, three dimensional cadastre data can be properly produced, especially in digital cadastre projects with the required point accuracy. Nevertheless this is not enough for LRCIS. The cadastre bases that have been produced so far by different methods with different scales and bases, with or without coordinates, should also be converted into digital form based on National Basic GPS Network of Turkey (NBGN) in required point-location accuracy. As the result of evaluation of <b>graphical</b> <b>cadastre</b> bases produced without coordinates, actual land measurements, and information obtained from sheets and field book data together, it was found out that there are significant base problems in the graphical maps. These bases, comprising 20 % of TurkeyÃ¢Â€Â™s cadastre constitutes the most important bottleneck of completing the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s cadastre. In the scope of this paper, the possibilities of converting the field book measurement values of graphic cadastre bases into digital forms in national coordinate system by comparing them with actual land measurements are investigated, along with TurkeyÃ¢Â€Â™s Cadastre and its problems...|$|E
40|$|Korean {{cadastral}} system keeps graphical maps made by {{the plane}} table method from 1910 ’s. The {{fact is that the}} graphical maps grafted on paper cover about 95 % of the whole land (MOGAHA, 1999). The needs are arising to transform the <b>graphical</b> <b>cadastre</b> to a digital one in compliance with modern technologies. Korean government has already begun to digitise the old maps from 1999. A nation-wide land information system will be established after the digitising project is completed. However, the accuracy of the digitised coordinates cannot meet the needs of cadastral surveyors and landowners at all because it cannot exceed that of the paper maps. The definite solution will be surveying all the parcels again and making new digital maps. A project will commence in 2004 to satisfy those needs by the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs. Re-surveying 34 million parcels cannot be done at once. The strategy should be dividing the country into county-wise or grid-wise pieces and surveying one by one. Municipal governments of counties, cities or urban districts will be the major sponsors of the project but the costs will hardly be affordable at a time. For the purpose of resolving the financial problem, each municipality can split its own project into smaller ones by year base. There is accordingly a great possibility to create inconsistency over the divided project areas caused by different techniques applied, different equipments used and/or mismatches of borders. Meanwhile, it also provides some merits. The people in completed areas will be satisfied with the enhanced accuracy and feel safe in land transaction, which stimulates land markets and, in turn, improves overall nation-wide economic situation. Thus, the main issue of the thesis shows how to make the cadastral re-survey project scalable. Guidelines to perform the job will be derived from some experienced cases. 1...|$|E
