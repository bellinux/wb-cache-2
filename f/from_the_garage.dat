5|$|Despite this, many post-grunge bands {{adopted a}} hard rock sound {{and in the}} 2000s there came a renewed {{interest}} in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new hard rock bands that emerged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> rock and post-punk revival scenes. Out of this movement came garage rock bands like the White Stripes, the Strokes, Interpol and, later on, the Black Keys. In the 2000s, only a few hard rock bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rekha escapes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> {{and enters}} the room where Chandru earlier claimed his mother stays. However, she finds only a {{skeleton}} and is cornered by Chandru, who tries to assault her. Ravi and Raghunath hear Rekha screaming and rush to the room. Raghunath subdues Chandru, who collapses and reveals that the skeleton is his mother's. Raghunath understands Chandru's love for {{his mother and his}} traumatic childhood, which had made him develop a hatred for women with loose morals. Chandru is arrested, while Rekha and Ravi unite.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, the nearly-40-year-old {{station and the}} older {{platforms}} were crumbling. Since the Newburyport/Rockport line {{was no longer a}} freight clearance route past the General Electric plant in West Lynn, a full-length high-level platform was built to replace the 1952 platforms. The wide platform occupies the width of one former island platform plus one track slot, with the line's two current tracks on each side. The 800-foot-long platform is located west of the older low platforms, which are still extant on the viaduct. A 930-space parking garage with a drop-off lane was built off Market Street; buses continued to use the former busway on Mount Vernon Street at Central Square. Entrances to the platform are available <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> and from Central Square. The new facility opened on January 21, 1992.|$|E

5|$|The video commences with a {{scene of}} the band {{beginning}} to perform the song in a house's detached garage. When the first verse starts, Stefani's ex-lover (Terry Hall) walks by the house before sitting down on a swing. Stefani changes her shoes as the song's chorus is played; she walks away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> and down a street to a grocery store. At the store, she purchases four cans of tomato sauce, and quickly leaves. Meanwhile, Dumont, Kanal, and Young prepare a large dinner for the band as Stefani reenters the home. Stefani slices tomatoes, Dumont cooks some spaghetti noodles, Kanal cuts up a few onions, and Young sets the table. At the song's bridge, Stefani accidentally cuts herself with a knife and Kanal drops a pot of pasta sauce; both of them promptly clean up their messes as dinner is served. Dumont initiates a food fight, and touring members Gabrial McNair and Stephen Bradley join in. The video ends with the ex-lover sitting alone on the swing.|$|E

25|$|His {{grandfather}} {{was murdered in}} 1937 for his labor-related activities. His grandfather had returned from a union meeting when one or more assailants attacked him as he walked <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> to his home. His skull was crushed and {{he was shot in}} the head. Law enforcement authorities suspected thugs under the control of Bugs Moran, head of the Chicago Mafia. Moran opposed Corcoran's efforts to organize workers at Walgreens, and had already severely beaten Corcoran several times while warning him to stop organizing workers. The Teamsters declared a holiday for Corcoran's funeral, and the event at the Basilica of St. Mary flowed into the street.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} site is {{on a steep}} hill, so the street-level entrance at the upper edge of the property is not the lowest floor. Four stories of apartments start at the ground floor and go up, and two more floors consisting of a 10-car garage and a sub-basement storage space are below grade, jutting out to the east because of the slope. [...] A manager's apartment was added in 1947 by extending steel beams <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> and suspending a two-floor unit with steel cables. Structural engineer W.S. Ellison oversaw construction of the primarily wooden frame structure, built atop a foundation and two utility floors made of reinforced concrete to meet exacting state requirements for stability.|$|E
500|$|... "96 Tears" [...] (1966) by Question Mark and the Mysterians, from Saginaw, Michigan, {{became a}} No.1 {{hit in the}} US. [...] The song's organ riffs and theme of teenage heartbreak have been {{mentioned}} as a landmark recording of the garage rock era and recognized for influencing the works of acts {{as diverse as the}} B-52's, the Cramps, and Bruce Springsteen. Two months later, the Music Machine, who reached the top 20 with fuzz guitar-driven [...] "Talk Talk",} had a sound and image that helped pave the way for later acts such as the Ramones. [...] The Syndicate of Sound's [...] "Little Girl", which featured a cocksure half-spoken lead vocal set over chiming 12-string guitar chords, reached No.8 on the Billboard charts and was later covered by acts such as the Dead Boys, the Banned, and the Chesterfield Kings.

500|$|Although Foo Fighters {{continued}} {{to be one of}} the most successful rock acts, with albums like In Your Honor (2005) reaching number two in the US and UK, many of the first wave of post-grunge bands began to fade in popularity. Acts like Creed, Staind, Puddle of Mudd and Nickelback took the genre into the 2000s with considerable commercial success, abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems, narratives and romantic songs. They were followed in this vein by new acts including Shinedown and Seether. Acts with more conventional hard rock sounds included Andrew W.K., Beautiful Creatures and Buckcherry, whose breakthrough album 15 (2006) went platinum and spawned the single [...] "Sorry" [...] (2007), which made the Top 10 of the Billboard 100. These were joined by bands with hard rock leanings that emerged in the mid-2000s <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage</b> rock, Southern Rock, or post punk revival, including Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Kings of Leon, and Queens of the Stone Age from the US, Three Days Grace from Canada, Jet from Australia and The Datsuns from New Zealand. In 2009 Them Crooked Vultures, a supergroup that brought together Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl, Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme and Led Zeppelin bass player John Paul Jones attracted attention as a live act and released a self-titled debut album that reached the top 20 in the US and UK and the top ten in several other countries.|$|E

[...] The pair demand that he open his trunk. [...] Inside are many CDs—the man proclaims his love of music—and a checker board. [...] To pass the time, the mysterious man engages Reyes and Scully in a game of checkers. [...] They play several rounds. [...] Reyes eventually realizes that the checkers' colors (red & black) are surrogates for Scully (a redhead) and herself (a brunette); The pair realize that the last victim, the numerologist (victim number 7) was a blonde, and that the murderer has been following a pattern of killing a blonde, then a redhead, then a brunette. [...] Thus, a redhead and a brunette are the anticipated hair-colors of the next two victims. [...] Scully and Reyes also realize that, although they assumed that the car that exited the garage was the killer, it was possible that the killer might still be inside the garage with them. [...] Scully and Reyes begin searching, but are surprised by the killer, who shuts off the lights, grabs Reyes and eventually gets hold of her gun. [...] However, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), also realizing that the number [...] "6" [...] pattern is actually a [...] "9" [...] and that the killer must intend to have two more victims, arrives {{in the nick of time}} to shoot him. [...] Reyes attempts to ask the killer why he did what he did. [...] The killer begins to mouth a word, but dies before being able to speak to Reyes. [...] Scully and Reyes then realize that the mysterious man and his car have disappeared <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>garage.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) {{inspection}} of the Hoover building revealed additional major deterioration.
