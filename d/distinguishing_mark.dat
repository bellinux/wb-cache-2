To distinguish themselves from ships of the Navy, such ships historically have flown their parent organisation's flag from a forward mast as a <b>distinguishing</b> <b>mark.</b> Today, for example, commissioned ships of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) fly the NOAA flag as a <b>distinguishing</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E

25|$|Much Roman {{history of}} the era is {{shrouded}} in legend, but {{it is believed that}} during the reign of Servius Tullius, the census (from Latin: censeō – accounting of the people) was introduced. With this all Roman able-bodied, property-owning male citizens were divided into five classes for military service based on their wealth and then organised into centuries as sub-units of the greater Roman army or legio (multitude). Joining the army was both a duty and a <b>distinguishing</b> <b>mark</b> of Roman citizenship; during the entire pre-Marian period the wealthiest land owners performed the most years of military service.

25|$|The Augustinian, or Austin, friars (O.S.A.), are a mendicant order. As consecrated religious, {{they pray}} the Liturgy of the Hours {{throughout}} the day. This Latin Rite Order, while a contemplative Order, differs from traditional monastic Orders in three ways: 1) They {{do not take}} vows of stability, meaning that they can live in one house (called a friary or sometimes a monastery) typically for several years before being moved into a different community of the Order. 2) They are engaged in apostolic activity, such as mission work, education, prison ministries, etc. The Order is {{under the supervision of}} a Prior General in Rome, and as an international Order they are divided into various Provinces throughout the world, with each Province being led by a Prior Provincial; (3) As an Order, they have a special commitment to corporate poverty as opposed to simply the poverty professed by the individual friar. While this is not currently legislated {{as it was in the}} origins of the Order, this is to be a <b>distinguishing</b> <b>mark</b> of their lives as a community.|$|E

[...] Both types were minted in 1982 with no <b>distinguishing</b> <b>mark.</b> Cents minted in 1943 were struck on planchets punched from zinc coated steel which left the resulting edges uncoated.

2500|$|Qualitative {{psychological}} research emphasizes fieldwork, {{and this}} emphasis {{has been offered}} as a <b>distinguishing</b> <b>mark.</b> Qualitative psychological research is also described as holistic. That is, qualitative researchers believe in studying phenomena in its context rather than concentrating on narrow aspects of the phenomena. This means that they either observe or participate in the phenomena they are studying, e.g. attending a football game to understand the behaviours of fan, and/or they ask open-ended questions about the behaviour of fans at football games. These questions are holistic because {{they are designed to}} understand the context of behaviour—they will usually follow a pattern that replicates the experience, e.g. [...] "What did you do when you arrived? Who did you come with? What did you do then?" [...] However, similar methods are used by quantitative researchers.|$|E

M. on the original line of battle, the entire army, at that time, having retired several miles toward Chattanooga. He was as brave a man as ever wore the blue, and I deem it a great privilege and honor to be remembered among his friends and acquaintances.
