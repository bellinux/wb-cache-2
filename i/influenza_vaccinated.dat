40|$|AbstractObjectiveAlthough {{pregnant}} women have increased risks for influenza morbidity and mortality, influenza vaccination rates among {{pregnant women}} in Canada are consistently very low. This mixed-methods {{study investigated the}} attitudes and behaviour of pregnant women and new mothers regarding seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination. MethodsWe conducted a baseline survey and qualitative focus groups with 34 women (26 pregnant women and 8 mothers of newborns), with a follow-up survey to assess outcomes {{at the end of}} the subsequent influenza season. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and directed content analysis based on the health belief model. ResultsMost women did not consider influenza vaccination to be an important preventative measure to take while pregnant, although some were more willing to consider vaccination during a pandemic. Omission bias played a substantial role as justification for not vaccinating. Participants expressed confusion about recommendations regarding vaccination during pregnancy and frustration with inconsistent messages from health care providers (HCPs), particularly with regard to pandemic vaccines. Women were vaccinated when they perceived themselves and/or their babies to be at increased risk for <b>influenza.</b> <b>Vaccinated</b> women had strong normative influences (usually an HCP or a family member) that affected their decision. Intentions accurately predicted behaviour for women who did and did not intend to be vaccinated. ConclusionPregnant women did not perceive themselves to be at increased risk for influenza and did not believe that influenza vaccination was a necessary preventative health measure. A lack of safety information about vaccination during pregnancy and inconsistent messages from HCPs were barriers to vaccine acceptance. Recommendations from maternity care providers and communication about the severity of and susceptibility to influenza for pregnant women would facilitate vaccine uptake...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{recent years}} several reports of {{influenza}} vaccine effectiveness (VE) {{have been made}} early for public health decision. The majority of these studies use the case test-negative control design (TND), which has been showed to provide, under certain conditions, unbiased estimates of influenza VE. Nevertheless, discussions have been taken on the best influenza negative control group to use. The present study aims {{to contribute to the}} knowledge on this field by comparing influenza VE estimates using three test-negative controls: all influenza negative, non-influenza respiratory virus and pan-negative. Methods Incident ILI patients were prospectively selected and swabbed by a sample of general practitioners. Cases were ILI patients tested positive for influenza and controls ILI patients tested negative for influenza. The influenza negative control group was divided into non-influenza virus control group and pan-negative control group. Data were collected on vaccination status and confounding factors. Influenza VE was estimated as one minus the odds ratio of been vaccinated in cases versus controls adjusted for confounding effect by logistic regression. Results Confounder adjusted influenza VE against medically attended laboratory-confirmed influenza was 68. 4 % (95 % CI: 20. 7 – 87. 4 %) using all influenza negatives controls, 82. 1 % (95 % CI: 47. 6 – 93. 9 %) using non-influenza controls and 49. 4 % (95 % CI: − 44. 7 % to 82. 3 %) using pan-negative controls. Conclusions Influenza VE estimates differed according to the influenza negative control group used. These results are in accordance with the expected under the hypothesis of differential viral interference between <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccinated</b> and unvaccinated individuals. Given the wide importance of TND study further studies should be conducted in order to clarify the observed differences...|$|E
40|$|False {{positive}} results {{are the major}} problem influencing interpretation of Clinical Laboratory test. They are originated mostly in the other diseases, technical errors and the recent vaccination. The problem has been presented since 1991 is positive HIV test after influenza Vaccination (1). The False positive {{has been reported in}} Cases using Eliza, one of The most common test to screen HIV, and in people vaccinated against influenza. (2) In a study carried out in 1992, nearly 1. 7 % of recently vaccinated subjects had false positive HIV(3) while Mackenzie's report was 0. 6 % to 1. 7 %. (4) In another study, the rate of false positive is 0. 9 % in 10 - 20 year-old subjects and 3. 1 % in subjects aged over 60. (5). In addition, the vaccinated cases suffered from infecfious disorders are highly predisposed to false positive HIV. (5) Considering the aforementioned points, we decided to determine false positive HIV in 196 vaccinated Cases set off for Mecca. (2004, Gorgan). After thorough examination of the cases, we injected them Influac (2005 / 2006) composing of 45 my heamagglutinine and neuramidase proteins extracted from Viruses of: 1 -A/California/ 7 / 2004 (H 3 N 2) -Like strain (A/New York/ 55 / 2004 NYMC X- 157) 2 -A/New Caledonia/ 20 / 99 (H 1 N 1) -Like strain (A/New Caledonia/ 20 / 99 IVR- 116) 3 -B/Shanghai/ 361 / 2002 -like strain (B/Jiangsu/ 10 / 2003) in 196 healthy <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccinated</b> group.

After seven weeks, HIV anti-body was analyzed using Eliza method (Diapro kit, Italy) Conclusion: The results show that no one has positive HIV. These finding is not in accord with previous studies.

40|$|Theoretical {{models of}} {{infection}} spread on networks predict that targeting vaccination at {{individuals with a}} very large number of contacts (superspreaders) can reduce infection incidence by a significant margin. These models generally assume that superspreaders will always agree to be vaccinated. Hence, they cannot capture unintended consequences such as policy resistance, where the behavioral response induced by a new vaccine policy tends to reduce the expected benefits of the policy. Here, we couple a model of influenza transmission on an empirically-based contact network with a psychologically structured model of <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccinating</b> behavior, where individual vaccinating decisions depend on social learning and past experiences of perceived infections, vaccine complications and vaccine failures. We find that policy resistance almost completely undermines the effectiveness of superspreader strategies: the most commonly explored approaches that target a randomly chosen neighbor of an individual, or that preferentially choose neighbors with many contacts, provide at best a 2 % relative improvement over their non-targeted counterpart as compared to 12 % when behavioral feedbacks are ignored. Increased vaccine coverage in super spreaders is offset by decreased coverage in non-superspreaders, and superspreaders also have a higher rate of perceived vaccine failures on account of being infected more often. Including incentives for vaccination provides modest improvements in outcomes. We conclude that the design of influenza vaccine strategies involving widespread incentive use and/or targeting of superspreaders should account fo...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevention}} of mother to child transmission of HIV {{has resulted in}} reduced burden of pediatric HIV-infection, but the prevalence of maternal HIV infection remains high in sub-Saharan African countries. HIV-exposed-uninfected infants have {{an increased risk of}} morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases than HIV-unexposed infants, particularly during {{the first six months of}} life, which in part might be due to lower levels of pathogen-specific protective antibodies acquired transplacentally from their mothers. This could be mitigated by vaccinating pregnant women to boost antibody levels; although vaccine responses among HIV-infected pregnant women might differ compared to HIV-uninfected women. We reviewed studies that compared natural and vaccine-induced antibody levels to different epitopes between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected pregnant women. Findings Most studies reported lower baseline/pre-vaccination antibody levels in HIV-infected pregnant women, which may not be reversed by antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. There were only few studies on vaccination of HIV-infected pregnant women, mainly on influenza virus and group B Streptococcus (GBS) vaccines. Immunogenicity studies on influenza vaccines indicated that HIV-infected pregnant women had lower vaccine induced hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers and a decreased likelihood of seroconversion compared to HIV-uninfected women; and while higher CD 4 + T-lymphocyte levels were associated with better immune responses to vaccination, HIV viral load was not associated with responses. Furthermore, infants born to <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccinated</b> HIV-infected pregnant women also had lower antibody levels and a lower proportion of HIV-exposed infants had titers above the putative correlate of protection compared to HIV-unexposed infants. The immunogenicity of a CRM 197 -conjugated trivalent GBS vaccine was also lower in HIV-infected pregnant women compared to HIV-uninfected women, irrespective of CD 4 + T-lymphocyte counts. Conclusions Poorer immunogenicity of vaccines reported in HIV-infected compared to HIV-uninfected pregnant women might compromise the potential benefits to their young infants. Alternate vaccination strategies, including vaccines with higher antigen concentration, adjuvanted vaccines or multiple doses schedules might be required in HIV-infected pregnant women to optimize antibody transferred to their fetuses...|$|E
40|$|Pathogens {{and host}} immune systems use strikingly similar methods of diversification. Mechanisms such as point {{mutations}} and recombination help pathogens escape the host {{immune system and}} similar mechanisms help the host immune system attack rapidly evolving pathogens. Understanding the interplay between pathogen and immune system evolution is crucial to effective drug and vaccine development. In this thesis we employ various computational methods to study diversification in a pathogen, an invertebrate and a vertebrate immune system. First, we develop a technique for phylogenetic inference {{in the presence of}} recombination based on the principle of minimum description length, which assigns a cost-the description length-to each network topology given the observed sequence data. We show that the method performs well on simulated data and demonstrate its application on HIV env gene sequence data from 8 human subjects. Next, we demonstrate via phylogenetic analysis that the evolution of repeats in an immune-related gene family in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus is the result of recombination and duplication and/or deletion. These results support the evidence suggesting that invertebrate immune systems are highly complex and may employ similar mechanisms for diversification as higher vertebrates. Third, we develop a probabilistic model of the immunoglobulin (Ig) rearrangement process and a Bayesian method for estimating posterior probabilities for the comparison of multiple plausible rearrangements. We validate the software using various datasets and in all tests, SoDA 2 performed better than other available software. Finally, we characterize the somatic population genetics of the nucleotide sequences of > 1000 recombinant Ig pairs derived from the blood of 5 acute HIV- 1 infected (AHI) subjects. We found that the Ig genes from the 20 day AHI PC showed extraordinary clonal relatedness among themselves; a single clone comprised of 52 members, with observed and inferred precursor antibodies specific for HIV- 1 Env gp 41. Antibodies from AHI patients show a decreased CDR 3 H length and an increased mutation frequency when compared to <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccinated</b> individuals. The high mutation frequency is coupled with a comparatively low synonymous to non-synonymous mutation ratio in the heavy chain. Our results may suggest presence of positive antigenic selection in previously triggered non-HIV- 1 memory B cells in AHI. Taken together, the studies presented in this thesis provide methods to study diversification in pathogens, and invertebrate and vertebrate immune systems. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{estimate}} {{influenza vaccine}} effectiveness (VE) for the 2007 – 2008 season {{and assess the}} sentinel surveillance system in Canada for monitoring virus evolution and impact on VE. Methods. Nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs and epidemiologic details were collected from patients presenting to a sentinel physician within 7 days of influenza-like illness onset. Cases tested positive for influenza A/B virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction; controls tested negative. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and gene sequen-cing explored virus relatedness to vaccine. VE was calculated as 1 minus the odds ratio for <b>influenza</b> in <b>vaccinated</b> versus nonvaccinated participants, with adjustment for confounders. Results. Of 1425 participants, 21 % were <b>vaccinated.</b> <b>Influenza</b> virus was detected in 689 (48 %), of which iso-lates from 663 were typed/subtyped: 189 (29 %) were A/H 1, 210 (32 %) were A/H 3, and 264 (40 %) were B. Of A/H 1 N 1 isolates, 6 % showed minor HI antigenic mismatch to vaccine, with greater variation based on genetic identity. All A/H 3 N 2 isolates showed moderate antigenic mismatch, and 98 % of influenza B virus isolates showed major lineage-level mismatch to vaccine. Adjusted VE for A/H 1 N 1, A/H 3 N 2, and B components was 69 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 44 %– 83 %), 57 % (95 % CI, 32 %– 73 %), and 55 % (95 % CI, 32 %– 70 %), respectively, with an overall VE of 60 % (95 % CI, 45 %– 71 %).

40|$|Influenza {{disease is}} a global health issue that causes {{significant}} morbidity and mortality through seasonal epidemics. Currently, inactivated influenza virus vaccines given intramuscularly or live attenuated influenza virus vaccines administered intranasally are the only approved options for vaccination against influenza virus in humans. We evaluated the efficacy of a synthetic toll-like receptor 4 agonist CRX- 601 as an adjuvant for enhancing vaccine-induced protection against influenza infection. Intranasal administration of CRX- 601 adjuvant combined with detergent split-influenza antigen (A/Uruguay/ 716 / 2007 (H 3 N 2)) generated strong local and systemic immunity against co-administered influenza antigens while exhibiting high efficacy against two heterotypic influenza challenges. Intranasal vaccination with CRX- 601 adjuvanted vaccines promoted antigen-specific IgG and IgA antibody responses and the generation of polyfunctional antigen-specific Th 17 cells (CD 4 (+) IL- 17 A(+) TNFα(+)). Following challenge with <b>influenza</b> virus, <b>vaccinated</b> mice transiently exhibited increased weight loss and morbidity during early stages of disease but eventually controlled infection. This disease exacerbation following <b>influenza</b> infection in <b>vaccinated</b> mice was dependent on both the route of vaccination {{and the addition of}} the adjuvant. Neutralization of IL- 17 A confirmed a detrimental role for this cytokine during influenza infection. The expansion of vaccine-primed Th 17 cells during influenza infection was also accompanied by an augmented lung neutrophilic response, which was partially responsible for mediating the increased morbidity. This discovery is of significance in the field of vaccinology, as it highlights the importance of both route of vaccination and adjuvant selection in vaccine development...|$|R

Influenza infections were verified by virus culture or polymerase chain reaction. We additionally randomized 303 children age 6 months to 5 years to receive either influenza vaccine (n = 202) or no vaccination (n = 101) before the influenza season.

40|$|The {{antibody}} {{responses to}} equine influenza viruses were investigated during a postepizootic {{period of the}} disease. Serum samples were collected from a total of 128 horses on three occasions during the years 1967 - 77.

The maternal hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers of foals decreased over a four month interval. A marked increase of the titers was recognized in only the equine <b>influenza</b> virus <b>vaccinated</b> horses. These findings suggest that equine influenza virus was not prevalent in the horse populations during the observation period. In such conditions, the dissemination of equine influenza viruses in the horses is discussed in relation to introduction of the disease from abroad. We also examined whether the doctrine of original antigenic sin, an immunological phenomenon recognized in human influenza, was applicable for equine influenza.

40|$|Influenza viruses undergo {{frequent}} antigenic changes. As a result, {{the viruses}} circulating change {{within and between}} seasons, and {{the composition of the}} influenza vaccine is updated annually. Thus, estimation of the vaccine's effectiveness is not constant across seasons. In order to provide annual estimates of the influenza vaccine's effectiveness, health departments have increasingly adopted the "test-negative design," using enhanced data from routine surveillance systems. In this design, patients presenting to participating general practitioners with influenza-like illness are swabbed for laboratory testing; those testing positive for influenza virus are defined as cases, and those testing negative form the comparison group. Data on patients' vaccination histories and confounder profiles are also collected. Vaccine effectiveness is estimated from the odds ratio comparing the odds of testing positive for <b>influenza</b> among <b>vaccinated</b> patients and unvaccinated patients, adjusting for confounders. The test-negative design is purported to reduce bias associated with confounding by health-care-seeking behavior and misclassification of cases. In this paper, we use directed acyclic graphs to characterize potential biases in studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness using the test-negative design. We show how studies using this design can avoid or minimize bias and where bias may be introduced with particular study design variations. Sheena G. Sullivan, Eric J. Tchetgen Tchetgen, Benjamin J.

In April 2009, a new influenza virus strain infecting humans was identified and rapidly spread globally. We compared the characteristics of patients ill with influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 virus to those ill with seasonal influenza and estimated influenza vaccine effectiveness during five influenza seasons (200522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2009) in South Africa. MethodsEpidemiological data and throat and/or nasal swabs were collected from patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) at sentinel sites.

VE against A/H 3 N 2 was 51 % (95 % CI, 10 %– 73 %) : circulating viruses were HI-characterized as vaccine-related but bore ≥ 11 AA differences from vaccine.

40|$|In the Netherlands {{there is}} an ongoing {{discussion}} about the question whether the government should stimulate vaccinating only risk groups or all persons of 65 years and older against influenza. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of both vaccination strategies a mathematical model has been developed. The model computes the epidemiological effects {{as well as the}} direct costs of care of an <b>influenza</b> epidemic. <b>Vaccinating</b> the elderly decreases the number of cases of influenza, mortality due to influenza and influenza related diseases and the number of years of life lost. Influenza related care (the number of GP-contacts and hospital days) and costs decrease more with the 65 + scenario compared to the risk group scenario. Although the cost of care decreases when vaccinating more persons, the cost of vaccination increases more and thus the total costs. If the price of vaccination (vaccine and administering) is decreased, the cost of vaccination will decrease as well. A break-even point between rising vaccination costs and decreasing care costs will be reached when the price of vaccination is more than halved. Compared to a number of other programmes vaccination against influenza is relatively cheap. Even with the current price of vaccination, an implemented programme for screening cervix cancer costs more than one and half as much per year of life gained. The model in its current form has been used for decision making by the government.

Three hundred twenty-five of 786 unique patients admitted during influenza season were eligible for vaccination. Of these, 49. 8 % refused. Parents of females, whites, and those with private insurance were more likely to refuse vaccination. Patients whose immunization status was otherwise up to date were more likely to accept (Odds Ratio 2. 39, 95 % Confidence Interval 1. 05 - 5. 41). Commonly cited reasons for refusal were: preference to have vaccination by the primary care provider (24. 1 %), concern for side effects (16. 1 %), not wanting vaccination (13 %), doubt in efficacy (8 %), concern that the child was already sick (6. 8 %), no prior influenza vaccination (6. 7 %) and feeling that it was not needed (5. 6 %). Hospitalization during influenza season provides an opportunity for health-care providers to educate families about <b>influenza</b> and <b>vaccinate</b> patients if appropriate. However, nearly half of parents of eligible children declined vaccination. More study is required to determine strategies that can increase influenza vaccination acceptance...|$|R
40|$|In a {{field study}} {{involving}} some 3000 soldiers in Japan, various doses from 0. 2 ml to 1. 0 ml of formol-killed monovalent Hong Kong influenza vaccine were administered. Before vaccination 92 % {{of the subjects}} had haemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titres of < 1 : 16; one month after vaccination, only from 1 % to 57 % (depending on the dose and the soldiers' camp involved) had so low an antibody level. In one vaccinated camp an epidemic of Hong Kong influenza broke out in January—March 1969. In a unit in which 80 % {{of the men had}} been vaccinated, there was an infection rate of 16 % among the vaccinated, of 26 % among the unvaccinated living in the same barracks and of 63 % among the unvaccinated living in separate barracks; these figures suggest that vaccination of at least 80 % of a population group will afford some protection to the unvaccinated remainder of the group against an epidemic of <b>influenza</b> provided the <b>vaccinated</b> and the unvaccinated are living in close association...|$|R
40|$|Protein D (PD) is {{a highly}} conserved 42 kDa surface {{lipoprotein}} found in all Haemophilus influenzae, including nontypeable (NT) H. influenzae. PD {{is involved in the}} pathogenesis of respiratory tract infections, in the context of which it has been shown to impair ciliary function in a human nasopharyngeal tissue culture model and to augment the capacity to cause otitis media in rats. A likely mechanism indicating that PD is a virulence factor is its glycerophosphodiesterase activity, which leads to the release of phosphorylcholine from host epithelial cells. PD has been demonstrated to be a promising vaccine candidate against experimental NT H. <b>influenzae</b> infection. Rats <b>vaccinated</b> with PD cleared NT H. influenzae better after middle ear and pulmonary bacterial challenge, and chinchillas vaccinated with PD showed significant protection against NT H. influenzae-dependent acute otitis media. In a clinical trial involving children, PD was used as an antigenically active carrier protein in an 11 -valent pneumococcal conjugate investigational vaccine; significant protection was achieved against acute otitis media not only caused by pneumococci but also caused by NT H. influenzae. This may have great clinical implications, because PD is the first NT H. influenzae antigen that has induced protective responses in humans...|$|R
40|$|Background Children play an {{important}} role in maintaining the transmission of influenza. Evidence suggests that vaccination of school-age children can reduce transmission to unvaccinated household contacts. We evaluated the direct and indirect effectiveness of the 2009 inactivated seasonal <b>influenza</b> vaccine in <b>vaccinated</b> schoolchildren and their unvaccinated household contacts. Methods This was a double-blind cluster randomized trial involving 10 schools and 1742 schoolchildren as well as 5406 household contacts. The schools were randomly assigned to receive the influenza vaccine or the control vaccine. After vaccination, the schoolchildren and household contacts were followed for 6 months to identify cases of acute respiratory infection (ARI). Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed for the diagnosis of influenza. Results A total of 632 ARI cases were detected. Of those, 103 tested positive for influenza virus (influenza virus A[H 1 N 1]pdm 09 virus in 55 and seasonal influenza viruses in 48). The effectiveness of the vaccine in protecting against seasonal influenza virus infection was 650 % for the household contacts (95 % CI, 196 – 843) and 650 % for the schoolchildren (95 % CI, 209 – 845).

40|$|The {{remarkable}} infectivity and virulence of the 1918 {{influenza virus}} {{resulted in an}} unprecedented pandemic, raising {{the question of whether}} it is possible to develop protective immunity to this virus and whether immune evasion may have contributed to its spread. Here, we report that the highly lethal 1918 virus is susceptible to immune protection by a preventive vaccine, and we define its mechanism of action. Immunization with plasmid expression vectors encoding hemagglutinin (HA) elicited potent CD 4 and CD 8 cellular responses as well as neutralizing antibodies. Antibody specificity and titer were defined by a microneutralization and a pseudotype assay that could assess antibody specificity without the need for high-level biocontainment. This pseudotype inhibition assay can define evolving serotypes of influenza viruses and facilitate the development of immune sera and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that may help contain pandemic <b>influenza.</b> Notably, mice <b>vaccinated</b> with 1918 HA plasmid DNAs showed complete protection to lethal challenge. T cell depletion had no effect on immunity, but passive transfer of purified IgG from anti-H 1 (1918) immunized mice provided protective immunity for naïve mice challenged with infectious 1918 virus. Thus, humoral immunity directed at the viral HA can protect against the 1918 pandemic virus...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Though {{influenza}} vaccines are {{the cornerstone of}} medical interventions aimed at protecting individuals against epidemic influenza, their effectiveness in HIV infected individuals is not certain. With the recent detection of influenza strains in countries with high HIV prevalence rates, we aimed at evaluating the current evidence on the efficacy and clinical effectiveness of {{influenza vaccines}} in HIV-infected individuals. Methods We used electronic databases to identify studies assessing efficacy or effectiveness of influenza vaccines in HIV patients. We included studies that compared the incidence of culture- or serologically-confirmed influenza or clinical influenza-like illness in vaccinated to unvaccinated HIV infected individuals. Characteristics of study participants were independently abstracted and the risk difference (RD), the number needed to vaccinate to prevent one case of influenza (NNV) and the vaccine effectiveness (VE) computed. Results We identified six studies that assessed the incidence of <b>influenza</b> in <b>vaccinated</b> HIV-infected subjects. Four of these studies compared the incidence in vaccinated versus unvaccinated subjects. These involved a total of 646 HIV-infected subjects. In all the 4 studies, the incidence of influenza was lower in the vaccinated compared to unvaccinated subjects with RD ranging from - 0. 48 (95 % CI: - 0. 63, - 0. 34) to - 0. 15 (95 % CI: - 0. 25, 0. 05); {{between 3 and 7}} people would need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza. Vaccine effectiveness ranged from 27 % to 78 %. A random effects model was used to obtain a summary RD of - 0. 27 (95 %CI: - 0. 42, - 0. 11). There was no evidence of publication bias. Conclusion Current evidence, though limited, suggests that influenza vaccines are moderately effective in reducing the incidence of influenza in HIV-infected individuals. With the threat of a global influenza pandemic, there is an urgent need {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} influenza vaccines in trials with a larger number of representative HIV-infected persons. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the 2011 - 2012 seasonal influenza vaccine was evaluated in adult Korean populations with regard to how well it could prevent laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-related complications. A retrospective case-control and retrospective cohort study was conducted among patients who visited four selected hospitals from September 2011 to May 2012. The analysis included 1, 130 laboratory-confirmed influenza patients. For each influenza case, one control patient was chosen {{at a ratio of}} 1 : 1. A control was defined as an age group-matched patient who visited the same hospital with influenza-like illness within 48 hours of symptom onset but for whom laboratory tests were negative for influenza. Age group and visit date were matched between the cases and controls. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was defined as [100 × (1 -odds ratio for <b>influenza</b> in <b>vaccinated</b> versus non-vaccinated persons) ]. The patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza were followed for at least one month through reviewing the medical records and conducting a telephone interview. The VE of the 2011 - 2012 seasonal influenza vaccine was 3. 8 % [95 % confidence interval (CI), - 16. 5 % to 20. 6 %] for preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, - 16. 1 % (95 % CI, - 48. 3 to 9. 1) for influenza A and 26. 2 % (95 % CI, - 2. 6 to 46. 2) for influenza B. The age-specific adjusted VE was 0. 3 % (95 % CI, - 29. 4 to 23. 1) among participants aged 19 to 49 years, 11. 9 % (95 % CI, - 34. 3 to 42. 2) among those aged 50 to 64 years and - 3. 9 % (- 60. 1 to 32. 5) among those aged ≥ 65 years. The adjusted VE for preventing any influenza-related complications was - 10. 7 % (95 % CI, - 41. 1 % to 42. 2 %).

ObjectiveTo pilot-test the methods {{for a future}} trial to compare the direct and indirect benefits of inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) vs. live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in preventing influenza infection. MethodsDuring the 2013 – 14 influenza vaccination campaign, we piloted an open-label cluster randomized trial involving 10 elementary schools in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. We randomized schools on a 1 : 1 basis to have students receive IIV or LAIV. We invited a subset of vaccinated students and their households {{to participate in a}} surveillance sub-study, which involved completing daily symptom diaries during influenza season and collecting mid-turbinate swabs from symptomatic individuals to detect influenza infection. The main outcome measure was confirmed influenza infection using a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. ResultsOne hundred and nineteen households (166 students and 293 household members) participated. During 15 weeks of surveillance, we detected 22 episodes of PCR-confirmed influenza (21 influenza A/H 1 N 1 and 1 influenza B). The incidence of influenza per 1000 person-days was 1. 24 (95 % CI, 0. 40 – 2. 89) for IIV-vaccinated students, compared to 0. 13 (95 % CI, 0. 003 – 0. 72) for LAIV-vaccinated students; the incidence rate ratio was 0. 10 (95 % CI, 0. 002 – 0. 94). Similarly, the incidence of influenza per 1000 person-days was 1. 33 (95 % CI, 0. 64 – 2. 44) for IIV household members, compared to 0. 47 (95 % CI, 0. 17 – 1. 03) for LAIV household members; the incidence rate ratio was 0. 36 (95 % CI, 0. 11 – 1. 08). The overall incidence rate ratio (combining students and household members) was 0. 27 (95 % CI, 0. 09 – 0. 69). ConclusionsHousehold surveillance involving participant monitoring and reporting of symptoms and self-collection of mid-turbinate swabs is feasible. A larger study is required to validate the suggestion that vaccinating children with LAIV might confer more protection against influenza for both children and their household contacts, compared to IIV.

40|$|There {{is a need}} {{to develop}} a {{universal}} vaccine against influenza virus infection to avoid developing new formulations of a seasonal vaccine each year. Many of the vaccine strategies for a universal vaccine target strain-conserved influenza virus proteins, such as the matrix, polymerase, and nucleoproteins, rather than the surface hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins. In addition, non-disease-causing viral vectors are a popular choice as a delivery system for the influenza virus antigens. As a proof-of-concept, we have designed a novel influenza virus immunogen based on the NP backbone containing human T cell epitopes for M 1, NS 1, NP, PB 1 and PA proteins (referred as NPmix) as well as a construct containing the conserved regions of influenza virus neuraminidase (N-terminal) and hemagglutinin (C-terminal) (referred as NA-HA). DNA vectors and vaccinia virus recombinants expressing NPmix (WR-NP) or both NPmix plus NA-HA (WR-flu) in the cytosol were tested in a heterologous DNA-prime/vaccinia virus-boost vaccine regimen in mice. We observed {{an increase in the number}} of influenza virus-specific IFNc-secreting splenocytes, composed of populations marked by CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells producing IFNc or TNFa. Upon challenge with <b>influenza</b> virus, the <b>vaccinated</b> mice exhibited decreased viral load in the lungs and a delay in mortality. These findings suggest that DNA prime/poxvirus boost with human multi-epitope recombinant influenza virus proteins is a valid approach for a general T-cell vaccine to protect against influenza viru...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is limited}} {{data on the}} {{epidemiology}} of influenza and few published estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) from Africa. In April 2009, a new influenza virus strain infecting humans was identified and rapidly spread globally. We compared the characteristics of patients ill with influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 virus to those ill with seasonal influenza and estimated influenza vaccine effectiveness during five influenza seasons (2005 – 2009) in South Africa. METHODS : Epidemiological data and throat and/or nasal swabs were collected from patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) at sentinel sites. Samples were tested for seasonal influenza viruses using culture, haemagglutination inhibition tests and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and for influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 by real-time PCR. For the vaccine effectiveness (VE) analysis we considered patients testing positive for influenza A and/or B as cases and those testing negative for influenza as controls. Age-adjusted VE was calculated as 1 -odds ratio for <b>influenza</b> in <b>vaccinated</b> and non-vaccinated individuals. RESULTS : From 2005 through 2009 we identified 3, 717 influenza case-patients. The median age was significantly lower among patients infected with influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 virus than those with seasonal influenza, 17 and 27 years respectively (p, 0. 001). The vaccine coverage during the influenza season ranged from 3. 4 % in 2009 to 5. 1 % in 2006 and was higher in the $ 50 years (range 6. 9 % in 2008 to 13. 2 % in 2006) than in the, 50 years age group (range 2. 2 % in 2007 to 3. 7 % in 2006). The age-adjusted VE estimates for seasonal influenza were 48. 6 % (4. 9 %, 73. 2 %); 214. 2 % (29. 7 %, 34. 8 %); 12. 0 % (270. 4 %, 55. 4 %); 67. 4 % (12. 4 %, 90. 3 %) and 29. 6 % (221. 5 %, 60. 1 %) from 2005 to 2009 respectively. For the A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 season, the efficacy of seasonal vaccine was 26. 4 % (293. 5 %, 43. 3 %). CONCLUSION : Influenza vaccine demonstrated a significant protective effect {{in two of the}} five years evaluated. Low vaccine coverage may have reduced power to estimate vaccine effectiveness.

40|$|School-located {{influenza}} vaccination (SLIV) programs can substantially enhance the sub-optimal coverage achieved under existing delivery strategies. Randomized SLIV trials have shown these programs reduce laboratory-confirmed <b>influenza</b> among both <b>vaccinated</b> and unvaccinated children. This work explores {{the effectiveness of}} a SLIV program in reducing the community risk of influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) associated emergency care visits. For the 2011 / 12 and 2012 / 13 influenza seasons, we estimated age-group specific attack rates (AR) for ILI from routine surveillance and census data. Age-group specific SLIV program effectiveness was estimated as one minus the AR ratio for Alachua County versus two comparison regions: the 12 county region surrounding Alachua County, and all non-Alachua counties in Florida. Vaccination of ∼ 50 % of 5 - 17 year-olds in Alachua reduced their risk of ILI-associated visits, compared to the rest of Florida, by 79 % (95 % confidence interval: 70, 85) in 2011 / 12 and 71 % (63, 77) in 2012 / 13. The greatest indirect effectiveness was observed among 0 - 4 year-olds, reducing AR by 89 % (84, 93) in 2011 / 12 and 84 % (79, 88) in 2012 / 13. Among all non-school age residents, the estimated indirect effectiveness was 60 % (54, 65) and 36 % (31, 41) for 2011 / 12 and 2012 / 13. The overall effectiveness among all age-groups was 65 % (61, 70) and 46 % (42, 50) for 2011 / 12 and 2012 / 13. Wider implementation of SLIV programs can significantly reduce the influenza-associated public health burden in communities...|$|R
