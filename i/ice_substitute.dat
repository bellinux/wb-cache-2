5000|$|Early {{attempts}} at {{the construction of}} artificial ice rinks were first made in the 'rink mania' of 1841-44. As the technology {{for the maintenance of}} natural ice did not exist, these early rinks used a substitute consisting of a mixture of hog's lard and various salts. An item in the 8 May 1844 issue of Eliakim Littell's Living Age headed [...] "The Glaciarium" [...] reported that [...] "This establishment, which has been removed to Grafton street East' Tottenham Court Road, was opened on Monday afternoon. The area of artificial ice is extremely convenient for such as may be desirous of engaging in the graceful and manly pastime of skating". By 1844, these venues fell out of fashion, as customers grew tired of the 'smelly' <b>ice</b> <b>substitute,</b> and it was only thirty years later, that refrigeration technology developed to the point that natural ice could finally be feasibly used in the rink. The world's first mechanically frozen ice rink was the Glaciarium, opened by John Gamgee in a tent in a small building just off the Kings Road in Chelsea, London, on 7 January 1876. In March, it moved to a permanent venue at 379 Kings Road, where a rink measuring 40 by 24 ft was established.|$|E
40|$|Stainless steels used in ice sliding applications, {{such as in}} {{the blades}} of ice skates, ski edges and runners of bobsleigh’s have {{notoriously}} poor tribological properties. During the study, microstructure and tribological behavior of AISI 420 and AISI 316 were studied and through the application of low temperature plasma surface modification, it has been possible to improve the base properties exhibited by the materials. Both grades of steel were subjected to a range of plasma surface modifications, using nitriding, carburizing and carbo-nitriding techniques over a set temperature range. Improvements in the surface hardness were documented in all cases. Characterization of the depth of the modified layer was carried out using SEM, GDOES and cross-sectional micro-hardness to obtain optimum conditions for treatment of replica steel blades for use in simulation wear testing. A synthetic <b>ice</b> <b>substitute</b> was created, for tribological testing, and an improvement in performance was observed following the surface modification procedure...|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} the snow-based dessert by this name are hard to verify, but the {{technique}} of using snow as a main ingredient in a dessert is very old. Common ingredients for this variety are a dairy based ingredient, sugar and a flavouring agent. In adding {{a small amount of}} dairy-based liquid and a flavouring agent (similar to ice cream ingredients) into clean snow, the snow melts and congeals into a simple <b>ice</b> cream <b>substitute.</b>|$|R
50|$|Its flow properties, high cooling {{capacity}} and flexibility in application make a slurry <b>ice</b> system a <b>substitute</b> for conventional <b>ice</b> generators and refrigeration systems, and offers improvements in energy efficiency: 70%, compared to around 45% in standard systems, lower freon consumption per ton {{of ice and}} lower operating costs.|$|R
50|$|The Purple Rain {{refers to}} at least two popular mixed drinks. The more common is a {{variation}} on the highball Long Island <b>Iced</b> Tea, <b>substituting</b> Chambord for Triple Sec and a lemon-lime soda for the cola. The other is a long cocktail made from vodka, lemonade, blue Curaçao and grenadine. The name of this version originates from the appearance of the drink as the grenadine is added as the final ingredient, since the sinking of the red grenadine through the blue of the other ingredients creates the impression of purple rain. This drink has many versions depending on where it is made.|$|R

50|$|It {{is known}} that by the 1880s the Boston Cooler was being served in Detroit, made with the local Vernors. Originally, a drink called a Vernors Cream was served as a shot or two of sweet cream poured into a glass of Vernors. Later, vanilla <b>ice</b> cream was <b>substituted</b> for the cream to make a Vernors float. Unlike a float, however, a Boston Cooler is blended like a thick milkshake. Both Sanders soda fountains and Michigan-based Big Boy {{restaurants}} (which had Boston Coolers as a signature item until the Elias Brothers sold their franchise to new ownership in the 1980s) used their milkshake blenders to prepare the drink.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{in other}} tower defense games, turrets {{can be placed}} {{anywhere}} and the enemies will go around them, forcing them to walk along any path the player makes. It {{is not possible to}} block the path however. Fieldrunners offers three types of gameplay: Classic, Extended and Endless. Playing in Classic and Extended modes limits the number of rounds in which the player must defend to 100. Classic only lets players build the original four towers, Gatling, Goo, Missile, and Tesla (except Skyway which substitutes Laser for Tesla and Frostbite which <b>substitutes</b> <b>Ice</b> for Goo). Extended mode adds the two new towers, Flame Tower and Mortar Tower (except Skyway which adds Tesla instead of Mortar). In Endless mode, the player may defend indefinitely. In any mode, the player may play in Easy, Medium, or Hard mode.|$|R
5000|$|A {{complete}} forward line {{consists of}} a left wing, a center, and a right wing, while a pair of defensemen who play together are called [...] "partners." [...] Typically, an NHL team dresses twelve forwards along four lines and three pairs of defensemen, though some teams elect to dress a seventh defenseman, or a thirteenth forward. In ice hockey, players are substituted [...] "on the fly," [...] meaning a substitution can occur even {{in the middle of}} play as long as proper protocol is followed (under typical ice hockey rules, the substituting player cannot enter the <b>ice</b> until the <b>substituted</b> player is within a short distance of the bench and not actively playing the puck); substitutions can still be made during stoppages. Usually, coordinated groups of players (called linemates) are substituted simultaneously in what are called line changes. Linemates may change throughout the game at the coach's discretion.|$|R
5000|$|Simplesse {{began in}} 1979 as [...] "a {{substance}} that gelled like egg white but crumbled like Styrofoam." [...] At that time, Shoji Yamamoto, {{an associate of}} Norman S. Singer at Canadian beer company John Labatt Ltd. in London, Ontario, brought Singer the whey protein substance. After sensing that it gave the taste texture of cream cheese, another scientist put a sample under a powerful microscope and saw [...] "tiny spheres of protein rolling over each other" [...] about a tenth the size of particles of powdered sugar. It was this particle rolling action that gave a smooth creaminess sensation. Another associate of Singer, scientist Nina Davis, worked for three years with Simplesse (then called microcurd) to adapt it to and incorporate it into many different food products. After Singer's boss observed that the product tasted like cheesecake, Singer filed for and received a United States patent for his efforts with the product. Labatt licensed the product to NutraSweet, a subsidiary of Creve Coeur, Missouri, United States chemical conglomerate Monsanto, in 1984. The product was given the trademark [...] "Simplesse" [...] in January 1988. An initial version of the product, approved for use in frozen desserts like low-fat <b>ice</b> cream <b>substitutes</b> by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), {{was introduced to the}} public about that same time as being [...] "the first completely natural fat substitute." [...] The FDA approved a second version of the product in 1991 for use in salad dressings, butter, and baked goods.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded by German-born Frederick Sanders Schmidt on June 17, 1875, when he opened a candy store with nothing besides his {{childhood}} dreams, a barrel of borrowed sugar and a leased shop on Woodward Avenue at Gratiot in downtown Detroit [...] Schmidt, who went by his middle name, had originally opened his first shop in Chicago but relocated to Detroit after his Chicago store was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1871.Ice cream was soon added to the menu, then baked goods and sweet cream sodas. One popular story asserts that {{on a hot summer}} day, the store was packed with thirsty customers, and Sanders noticed that the sweet cream used for the sodas had gone sour. So he quickly <b>substituted</b> <b>ice</b> cream, and it became the talk of the town. Sanders is among those who claim to have invented the ice cream soda. Business became so brisk that the store expanded and Sanders hired more employees.|$|R
40|$|Ice {{nucleation}} {{in clouds}} {{has a significant}} impact on the global hydrological cycle as well as on the radiative budget of the Earth. The AIDA cloud chamber was used to investigate the ice nucleation efficiency of various atmospherically relevant mineral dusts. From experiments with Arizona Test Dust (ATD) a humidity and temperature dependent ice nucleation active surface site density parameterization was developed to describe deposition nucleation at temperatures above 220 K. Based on these results, a parameterization for deposition nucleation initiated by desert dusts and clay minerals is proposed. The time dependence observed during the deposition nucleation experiments with ATD seems to be relevant only at very small cooling rates. Experiments with atmospherically relevant dust samples revealed large differences in the ice nucleation efficiencies among the different dusts. Volcanic ash emitted during the Eyjafjallajökull eruption in 2010 proved to be slightly less ice-active than mineral dust particles from desert areas. In contrast, soil dust particles rich in organic matter and fossile diatomite were very ice-active particles. For the soil dust particles, the soil organic matter is probably the reason for the enhanced ice nucleation efficiency compared to desert dusts which is, however, most likely not directly determined by viable organisms such as fungi or bacteria. Coatings with secondary organic compounds led to a significant deterioration of the ice nucleation efficiency observed for fossil diatomite in the immersion freezing and the deposition nucleation mode. Deposition mode nucleation initiated by mineral dust particles was suppressed by coatings with sulfuric acid whereas there was no effect on the immersion freezing properties. The immersion freezing properties of several substrates used as <b>ice</b> nuclei <b>substitutes</b> were investigated with a cold stage setup. Muscovite initiated heterogeneous ice nucleation at approximately 250 K but was much less ice-active than mineral dusts. Droplets placed on silicon wafers froze only close to the homogeneous freezing threshold. The freezing properties of these silicon wafers could be changed signicantly by modifying the wafer surface through adding regular structures such as trenches which suggests that the surface morphology may have an influence on the ice nucleation efficiencies of atmospheric particles...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the effects of shortwave diathermy (SWD) and ice on pain, range of motion and function in osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Subjects were fourteen patients (4 males and 10 females) aged 40 - 70 years diagnosed as having OA of the knee. Subjects were assigned into either the SWD or ice treatment groups, as they became available. All subjects received routine adjunct therapeutic exercises, were excluded from analgesic drugs and were treated thrice weekly during the four-week duration of the study. Subjects were assessed {{at the beginning and end}} of the study for pain, range of motion (ROM) and function using visual analog scale, universal goniometer and functional index questionnaire respectively. Data were subjected to descriptive statistics of means and standard deviation and inferential statistics of independent and paired t-tests. Results showed that while the subjects in the SWD group had significantly greater ROM and function than the ice group at the beginning of the study, both groups were not statistically significantly different on all dependent variables at the end of the study. Paired t-test also indicated that the ice group improved significantly on all three dependent variables while the SWD group improved significantly in pain and ROM only. The improv ements in pain, ROM and function effected by SWD and ice were however not significantly different. It was concluded that SWD and ice are equally effective on OA of the knee and that <b>ice</b> can be <b>substituted</b> for SWD in the treatment of OA of the knee...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives : Xerostomia and {{salivary gland}} hypofunction are {{associated}} with advancing age, autoimmune diseases such as Sjφgren′s syndrome, head and neck radiation, smoking and recreational drug usage. Palliative management of xerostomia includes topical agents such as <b>ice</b> chips, saliva <b>substitutes,</b> increasing water intake, paraffin and citric acid containing lozenges. Systemic agents have been used, but some drugs {{have been found to}} have unfavorable side effects. Therefore, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on whole salivary flow rate in healthy adult subjects. Study Design : One hundred healthy adult subjects (50 males and 50 females), with no history of salivary gland disorder, were enrolled in this study. TENS electrode pads were placed externally on the skin overlying the parotid glands. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected for five minutes in a graduated tube, using a standardized collection technique. The TENS unit was then activated and stimulated saliva was collected for an additional five minutes. Results : Eighty five of the 100 subjects demonstrated increased whole salivary flow when stimulated via the TENS unit. Eleven experienced no change and four experienced a decrease in the salivary flow. The mean unstimulated salivary flow rate was 0. 36 ml/min (SD 0. 16) and there was a 21 % increase in the salivary flow following TENS application. Statistical analysis of flow rates utilizing the paired ′t′ test showed the difference to be statistically significant (P< 0. 001). Interpretation and Conclusion : The TENS unit was effective in increasing whole salivary flow in 85 % of the healthy adult subjects. A further study in patients with xerostomia, secondary to various local and systemic causes, is required...|$|R
2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{penalties}} that can result in a power play for the non-offending team: minor (two minutes) and major (five minutes). For such penalties, the offending player is ruled off the <b>ice</b> and no <b>substitute</b> for the penalized player is permitted. A power play resulting from a minor penalty ends if the team with more players on the ice scores. [...] If the penalty is instead a double minor, a goal scored by the team with advantage ends the first minor penalty, so that 2 goals by the team with more players are needed to end the power play. If a player is given a major penalty (five minute duration), a power play occurs, but if the team on the power play scores, the penalty is not ended, except if the goal is scored in overtime, as this ends the game. Major penalties only end when five minutes have elapsed or the game has ended. If a team is still on a power play {{at the end of a}} regulation period, or at the end of a playoff overtime period, the power play will continue into the following period. [...] "Misconduct" [...] penalties (10 minutes in duration), and [...] "game misconduct" [...] penalties (offending player is ejected for the balance of the game) allow for substitution of the offending player, so do not result in power plays. However in practice, misconduct and game misconduct penalties are often assessed in addition to a major or minor penalty. A [...] "match" [...] penalty results in the offending player being ejected for the balance of the game and a 5-minute power play for the non-offending team. The power play does not end if the advantaged team scores a goal, identical to major penalties.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{and field}} data {{have shown that}} large amounts of water can be redistributed from warmer soils to and behind an {{advancing}} freezing front. The mechanisms by which this occurs are becoming more understood, but the most appropriate method for analysing these mechanisms is not yet known. Various researchers have developed soil freezing models, but they are all limited to some extent and are not practical tools from a design or predictive modelling perspective. The objective of this research program is to develop unsaturated soil freezing theory from a geotechnical engineering perspective, and to verify the theory by modifying an existing non-freezing soil heat and mass transfer model. In this study the SoilCover (MEND, 1993) model is modified to verify the theory and numerical solution. SoilCover (MEND, 1993) is a one-dimensional soil heat flow and mass transfer computer model used for designing protective covers over waste rock and tailings. These covers, if they remain saturated, significantly reduce oxygen infiltration into the waste material where it can combine with water to produce acid mine drainage. SoilCover (MEND, 1993) is not capable of modelling through the winter months when upper regions of the covers become subjected to freezing temperatures. Unique to the modified soil freezing model is the method by which the coupled heat and mass equations are combined and solved. The numerical model uses a single, unique expression which describes the heat flow, mass transfer, and phase change phenomenon in the frozen or partially frozen soil zones. To derive the modified equation, the dependent suction variable in the mass transfer equation is re-written {{as a function of}} freezing point depression temperature using a Clapeyron type relationship that is obtained by combining soil freezing curve data with soil water characteristic curve data. The mass transfer equation is then re-written as a function of change in <b>ice</b> content and <b>substituted</b> into the <b>ice</b> content term of the heat transfer equation. The result is a single combined heat and mass transfer equation with one unknown variable, i. e., temperature. Once new temperatures are solved for over the current time step, suctions and ice contents are computed using back-substitution. The revised model was verified using laboratory freezing test data collected at the University of Saskatchewan in 1977. During laboratory data modelling of three freezing tests, the average percent difference between measured and computed frost front positions was approximately 6 %. The average difference between measured and computed ice contents was approximately 7 %, and the average difference between measured and computed liquid water contents was approximately 14 %. These discrepancies were primarily due to errors in the estimated and measured soil thermal and hydraulic property functions. Results of the laboratory data simulations suggest that the permeability versus suction relationship for an unsaturated soil also applies as soil pore-water freezes. This finding is contrary to the findings of other researchers who had to introduce an arbitrary ice impedance factor to make computed and measured ice contents agree. The ice impedance factor has the effect of reducing the permeability by several orders of magnitude as the volumetric pore-ice content increases. In this study, good agreement between computed and measured ice contents was obtained without the use of an impedance factor. To demonstrate an application of the revised model, a simulation of freezing and thawing in a soil cover system was carried out and compared to field data collected during the winter of 1993 / 1994 at a silver mine near Houston, B. C. For comparisons between the field data and simulations, the soil surface temperature beneath the snow pack had to be estimated as the numerical model does not account for heat and mass flux through snow layers. Daily infiltration during the spring thaw was also estimated based on averaged meteorological data provided by Equity Mine...|$|R
