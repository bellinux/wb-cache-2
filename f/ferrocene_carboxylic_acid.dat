40|$|The High Speed Channel Electrode {{is used to}} {{precisely}} measure the standard electrochemical rate constants under steady state conditions for the oxidation of substituted ferrocenes in alkyl cyanide solvents. First, the oxidation of ferrocene itself is kinetically analysed in the solvents: acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile and valeronitrile. Second, the oxidation kinetics of the ferrocene derivatives: <b>ferrocene</b> <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid,</b> decamethyl ferrocene, bis(diphenylphosphino) ferrocene, ferrocene carboxaldehyde, α-hydroxyethyl ferrocene, t-butyl ferrocene, dimethyl aminomethyl ferrocene, dimethyl ferrocene and n-butyl ferrocene are measured in acetonitrile for comparison to ferrocene. The rate of electron transfer in the different alkyl cyanides is shown {{to depend on the}} longitudinal dielectric relaxation times of the solvents in accordance with solvent dynamic theory, whilst the electron transfer rates of the different ferrocene derivatives in acetonitrile are shown to depend on the hydrodynamic radii of the molecules. In both cases, a measured k 0 = 1. 0 ± 0. 2 cm s- 1 for ferrocene oxidation in acetonitrile shows an excellent fit to the theoretical dependences. © 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{versatile}} two-step {{method is}} developed to covalently immobilize redox-active molecules onto carbon surfaces. First, a robust anchoring platform is grafted onto surfaces by electrochemical reduction of aryl diazonium salts in situ generated. Depending {{on the nature}} of the layer termini, -COOH or -NH(2), a further chemical coupling involving ferrocenemethylamine or <b>ferrocene</b> <b>carboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives leads to the covalent binding of ferrocene centers. The chemical strategy using acyl chloride activation is efficient and flexible, since it can be applied either to surface-reactive end groups or to reactive species in solution. Cyclic voltammetry analyses point to the covalent binding of ferrocene units restricted to the upper layers of the underlying aryl films, while AFM measurements show a lost of compactness of the layers after the chemical attachment of ferrocene centers. The preparation conditions of the anchoring layers were found to determine the interfacial properties of the resulted ferrocenyl-modified electrodes. The ferrocene units promoted effective redox mediation providing that the free redox probes are adequately chosen (i. e., vs size/formal potential) and the underlying layers exhibit strong blocking properties. For anchoring films with weaker blocking effect, the coexistence of two distinct phenomena, redox mediation and ET at pinholes could be evidenced...|$|E
