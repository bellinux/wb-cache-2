40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{developing}} the new engineering materials such as structural materials and tribomaterials based on plants-derived polymers, the tribological properties of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filled plants-derived semi-aromatic polyamide 10 T (PA 10 T) composites and glass fiber (GF) reinforced PTFE/PA 10 T composites were investigated. PA 10 T {{is a kind of}} polyphthalamide (PPA, semi-aromatic polyamide) and biomass polymer made from plants-derived <b>decamethylenediamine</b> and coal-derived terephthalic acid. PTFE/PA 10 T and GF/PA 10 T/PTFE composites were melt-mixed by a twin screw extruder and injection-molded. Their mechanical properties such as tensile, Izod impact, and tribological properties were evaluated. Tribological properties were measured by a ring-on-plate type sliding wear tester under dry condition. Tribological properties of PA 10 T such as frictional coefficient, specific wear rate and limiting pv value improved with the addition of PTFE, although the mechanical properties such as tensile strength and tensile modulus decreased with PTFE. On the other hand, the frictional coefficient and specific wear rate of GF/PA 10 T/PTFE composites were higher than those of PTFE/PA 10 T composites, however limiting pv value and mechanical properties improved significantly with the filling of GF. It follows from these results that {{it may be possible to}} develop the new tribomaterials based on plants-derived polymer composites with sufficient balances between mechanical and tribological properties...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} develop the new {{engineering}} materials such as structural materials and tribomaterials based on all plants-derived materials, the influence of silane coupling agent on the rheological properties of hemp fiber (HF) filled polyamide 1010 (PA 1010) biomass composites in molten state was investigated for one step of the fabrication of these materials. PA 1010 was made from sebacic acid and <b>decamethylenediamine,</b> which are obtained from plant-derived castor oil. Hemp fibers were surface-treated by two types of surface treatment: a) alkali treatment by NaOH solution and b) surface treatment by silane coupling agents with different concentrations. Three types of silane coupling agents: aminosilane, epoxysilane and ureidosilane were used for surface treatment. HF/ PA 1010 composites were extruded by a twin screw extruder and compression-molded. Rheological behavior in molten state were evaluated by oscillatory flow testing using a parallel plate type rheometer. It {{was found that the}} silane coupling agents remarkably influence on: 1) rheological properties such as storage modulus, loss modulus, loss tangent and complex viscosity in low angular frequency region in molten state, 2) temperature dependences of rheological properties, and 3) relationship between phase angle and complex modulus (van Gurp - Palmen plots). These rheological behavior were also strongly influenced by the type of silane coupling agents. The viscoelastic properties (both storage and loss moduli) of aminosilane and epoxysilane treated composites were lower, however, those of ureidosilane treated ones were higher than the moduli of only alkali treated composites. Ureidosilane treated composites were the least temperature sensitive in the surface treated composites investigated here...|$|E
