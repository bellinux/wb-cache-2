40|$|Working {{capital is}} an {{investment}} which is tied up into the inventories and accounts receivable and which is released with accounts payable. Due to the current business landscape with tightened financial conditions and finance markets, organizations emphasize efficient <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management. With efficient <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management, a company can reduce the need of finance, free up cash, increase profitability, improve liquidity, increase the efficiency of operations, and decrease (financing) costs. From the perspective of an individual company, efficient <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management means decreasing inventory levels by shortening the cycle time of inventories, decreasing accounts receivable by shortening the trade credit terms and effective collection procedures, and increasing the level of accounts payable by paying the suppliers later. From an inter-organizational perspective, however, <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> should not be sub-optimized by a single company but holistic view to <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management through the supply chain should be adopted to create value and improve performance together. The purpose {{of this research is}} to take academic research as well as practical management towards inter-organizational <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management. The thesis discusses the benefits as well as mechanisms of <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management in the inter-organizational context and has two main objectives: (1) to examine the effect of inter-organizational <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management on performance in the value chain context and (2) to develop models of <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management for internal as well as inter-organizational value chains. The results of the archival research conducted in the value chain of the pulp and paper industry and the value chain of the automotive industry indicate that companies can increase relative profitability by managing <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> comprehensively by taking into account all three components, and holistically though the value chain. Companies in the value chain benefit from different strategies in <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management depending on the position of the company in the value chain. This can be taken into account in inter-organizational <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management. The effects of inter-organizational <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management actions on the financing costs of <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> were studied via simulations. Simulations also show that the value chain and individual companies benefit from an inter-organizational view to <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management. Inter-organizational <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management actions include for example: shortening the cycle time of inventories, reducing product costs, shifting inventories, shortening payment terms, and considering the cost of capital. The thesis also provides solutions for the practical requirements for tools to control <b>working</b> <b>capital.</b> The design science part of the research introduces the adjusted cash conversion cycle (ACCC) model for internal value chains, as well as models for <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management in the inter-organizational value chain context: the <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management model (WCMM) and the financial cycle time model (FCTM) designed in corporation and product levels respectively.

40|$|The {{theory of}} <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> {{management}} contends that if <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> is managed according to prescriptive theory {{then it would}} be expected that businesses would invest in <b>working</b> <b>capital,</b> finance <b>working</b> <b>capital,</b> monitor factors that influence <b>working</b> <b>capital,</b> manage cash, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, the cash conversion cycle (aggregative approach), and measure and analyze performance to ensure that the long term (fixed) assets are utilized effectively and efficiently. This thesis seeks to shed light on the problem, how <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> is managed by New Zealand listed limited liability companies. This is achieved by applying New Zealand data collected by means of a postal questionnaire to an empirical <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management model. The main findings indicate that businesses in New Zealand consider <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management an important issue, yet a large group of respondents ignored the survey. It is evident that the respondents placed greater emphasis or importance on the financing decision, with the investment decision largely taken for granted. Some effort is made prima facie to manage cash, accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable independently of each other. However given the theory of <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management, there may be room for improvement regarding the strategies, tactics and techniques used to manage these components. Furthermore, the findings suggest that <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> management is also strategic as it impact on the liquidity, solvency/bankruptcy, efficiency, profitability and shareholder wealth maximization of the business. In light of the findings, it was recommended that an in-depth case study research approach can enhance the survey questionnaire to further investigate the findings. Further research should focus on the levels, composition, structure, and performance of <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> and introduce financial data for this purpose. It is evident from {{the results of the study}} that the purpose and function of <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> are not clearly and sufficiently recognized, and that it is quite likely that deficiencies and insufficiencies in the management of <b>working</b> <b>capital</b> in New Zealand may be revealed by further empirical research...|$|R
