5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer striking mechanism and a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary dial fire control selector, {{located at the}} foot of the trigger. The dial has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling the trigger fully to the rear produces <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> fire.|$|E
5|$|This is a semiautomatic version {{manufactured}} for {{the civilian}} sport shooting market. Derived from the <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> military firearm, this version shares {{most of the}} major components of the military models {{with the exception of the}} firing mechanism and the addition of welded internal components to prevent conversion to a <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> mode. Notably, this version retains the ability to be belt fed, an uncommon feature in civilian firearms.|$|E
5|$|The {{finish of}} a race {{is marked by a}} white line 5cm wide. The {{finishing}} position of athletes is determined by the order in which any part of their torso (as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of the finish line. <b>Fully</b> <b>automatic</b> timing systems (photo timing) {{are becoming more and more}} common at increasingly lower levels of track meets, improving the accuracy, while eliminating the need for eagle-eyed officials on the finish line. <b>Fully</b> <b>automatic</b> timing (FAT) is required for high level meets and any time a (sprint) record is set (though distance records can be accepted if timed by three independent stopwatches).|$|E

5|$|Konrad Zuse's Z3 was the world's first working programmable, <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> computer, with binary digital {{arithmetic}} logic, but {{it lacked}} the conditional branching of a Turing machine. On 12 May 1941, it was successfully presented {{to an audience}} of scientists of the Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt ("German Laboratory for Aviation") in Berlin. The Z3 stored its program on an external tape, but it was electromechanical rather than electronic. The Colossus of 1943 was the first electronic computing device, {{but it was not a}} general-purpose machine.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{has been}} the home of many famous inventors and engineers, {{including}} Hans Geiger, {{the creator of the}} Geiger counter; and Konrad Zuse, who built the first <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> digital computer. Such German inventors, engineers and industrialists as Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, Otto Lilienthal, Gottlieb Daimler, Rudolf Diesel, Hugo Junkers and Karl Benz helped shape modern automotive and air transportation technology. German institutions like the German Aerospace Center (DLR) are the largest contributor to ESA. Aerospace engineer Wernher von Braun developed the first space rocket at Peenemünde and later on was a prominent member of NASA and developed the Saturn V Moon rocket. Heinrich Rudolf Hertz's work in the domain of electromagnetic radiation was pivotal to the development of modern telecommunication.|$|E
5|$|Spent {{cartridges}} {{found at}} a scene can be examined for physical evidence such as fingerprints or compared to samples that match them to a weapon. The examination of the cartridge relies on the unique tool marks left by the {{various parts of the}} weapon including the firing pin and the ejector in semi and <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> firearms. These markings can be compared and matched to known exemplars fired from the same weapon using the same parts. The examination of the marks left on the cartridge is done using a comparison microscope. Examiners view the questioned cartridge and the known exemplar simultaneously, looking for similar microscopic marks left during the firing process.|$|E
40|$|Hippocampus is an {{important}} biomarker of certain brain disorders. So, there is quite much interest in the automated segmentation of hippocampus {{in order to make}} diagnosis more accurate and robust. This study reviews the hippocampus segmentation methods based on 15 journal papers from the literature. Methods are divided into two main categories: semi-automatic and <b>fully</b> <b>automatics</b> methods. Techniques which are employed in each paper are categorized in three main methods: Region Growing, Atlas-based Segmentation and Machine learning methods. Although the methods varies quite, registration techniques are mostly included in almost every method to have good alignment of images. Since the good anatomical match between both atlas and the target image is crucial, the atlas selection techniques are one of the main concerns of Atlas-based segmentations. Machine learning methods mainly include AdaBoost and Support-vector machines...|$|R

5|$|In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, {{students}} and entrepreneurs presented a <b>fully</b> <b>automatic,</b> prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them. The final product is served with mayonnaise, ketchup or curry. The process takes around two minutes {{from start to}} finish, in which the product is served in a paper cup. The potato strips are stored in a frozen state inside the machine at −18°C, and it cooks them in oil at 180°C. The unit uses a specially-designed dispenser to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and a fork and salt are provided separately in a box.|$|E
5|$|Neil Rubenking of PC Magazine {{successfully}} {{installed the}} beta version on 12 malware-infected systems and commented on its small installation package (about 7 MB, {{depending on the}} operating system) and speedy installation. But the initial virus definition update took between 5 and 15 minutes, and the full installation occupied about 110 MB of disk space. Rubenking noted that the beta version sets Windows Update into <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> mode, although it can be turned off again through Windows Control Panel. Some full scans took {{more than an hour}} on infected systems; a scan on a clean system took 35 minutes. An on-demand scan test Rubenking conducted in June 2009 with the beta version found 89 percent of all malware samples: 30 percent of the commercial keyloggers, 67 percent of rootkits, but only half of the scareware samples. The product's real-time protection found 83 percent of all malware and blocked the majority of it: 40 percent of the commercial keyloggers and 78 percent of the rootkits were found.|$|E
5|$|The IAAF ratifies {{track and}} field world records if they meet their set criteria. The IAAF first {{published}} a world records list in 1914, initially for men's events only. There were 53 recognised records in running, hurdling and relay, and 12 field records. World records in women's events began in 1936 as more events were gradually added to the list, but significant changes {{were made in the}} late 1970s. First, all records in imperial measurements were abandoned in 1976, with the sole exceptional being the mile run due to the prestige and history of the event. The following year, all world records in sprint events would only be recognised if <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> electronic timing was used (as opposed to the traditional hand-timing stopwatch method). In 1981, electronic timing was made compulsory for all world record runs in {{track and field}}, with times being recorded to within one hundredth of a second. Two additional types of world record were introduced in 1987: world records for indoor competitions, and world records for junior athletes under 20 years old.|$|E

5|$|The MP 40 submachine {{guns are}} open-bolt, blowback-operated {{automatic}} arms. The only mode of fire was <b>fully</b> <b>automatic,</b> but {{the relatively low}} rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls. The bolt features a telescoping return spring guide {{which serves as a}} pneumatic recoil buffer. The cocking handle was permanently attached to the bolt on early MP 38s, but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s, the bolt handle was made as a separate part. It also served as a safety by pushing the head of handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locked the bolt either in the cocked (rear) or uncocked (forward) position. The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop, used to hold the bolt in forward position.|$|E
25|$|With <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> weapons, open-bolt {{operation}} allows air to circulate, cooling the barrel; with semi-automatic firearms, the closed-bolt {{operation is}} preferred, as overheating {{is not as}} critical, and accuracy is preferred. Some select-fire military weapons use an open bolt in <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> mode and a closed bolt when semi-automatic is selected.|$|E
25|$|The {{usage of}} the term {{automatic}} may vary according to context. Gun specialists {{point out that the}} word automatic is sometimes misunderstood to mean <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> fire when used to refer to a self-loading, semi-automatic firearm not capable of <b>fully</b> <b>automatic</b> fire. In this case, automatic refers to the loading mechanism, not the firing capability.|$|E
