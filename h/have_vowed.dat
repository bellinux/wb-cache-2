25|$|In 1968, Edward Heath issued his 'Perth declaration', {{in support}} of a Scottish assembly, in the wake of growing nationalism. However, the cause went {{unanswered}} during his turbulent premiership, and under Margaret Thatcher and John Major's leadership, the Conservatives vehemently opposed devolution, and campaigned against it in the 1997 devolution referendum. Following the Scottish Parliament's establishment in 1999, they <b>have</b> <b>vowed</b> to support its continued existence, and along with Labour and the Liberal Democrats, they supported the Scotland Bill (2011), granting further devolution of power. They campaigned alongside Labour and the Liberal Democrats against full Scottish Independence in the 2014 Scottish Independence referendum.|$|E

25|$|Two legal {{challenges}} to Northern Ireland's same-sex marriage ban were {{heard in the}} High Court in November and December 2015. Two couples, Grainne Close and Shannon Sickles and Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kanem brought the case claiming that Northern Ireland's prohibition on same-sex marriage breached their human rights. The case was heard simultaneously with a case brought in January 2015 in which two men who wed in England sought to have their marriage recognised in Northern Ireland. A ruling was handed down in August 2017; Judge O'Hara found against the couples and determined {{that there were no}} grounds under case law from the European Court of Human Rights that the couple’s rights were violated by Northern Ireland's refusal to recognise their union as a marriage. The couples <b>have</b> <b>vowed</b> to appeal.|$|E
25|$|Some U.S. {{retailers}} offer {{opportunities for}} consumer recycling of discarded electronic devices. In the US, the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) urges consumers to dispose properly of end-of-life electronics through its recycling locator at www.GreenerGadgets.org. This list only includes manufacturer and retailer programs {{that use the}} strictest standards and third-party certified recycling locations, to provide consumers assurance that their products will be recycled safely and responsibly. CEA {{research has found that}} 58 percent of consumers know where to take their end-of-life electronics, and the electronics industry would very much like to see that level of awareness increase. Consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers sponsor or operate more than 5,000 recycling locations nationwide and <b>have</b> <b>vowed</b> to recycle one billion pounds annually by 2016, a sharp increase from 300 million pounds industry recycled in 2010.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} six days of the Kuttantavar festival, Aravan's head (cami) is [...] "danced" [...] around the streets of Kuvagam, with music and {{fireworks}} accompanying it. Each household offers a puja (a kind of devotional ceremony) to Aravan, with lamp-waving, coconut-offerings and other rituals. Traditionally, goats and chickens are sacrificed. On the 13thday, Aravan's [...] "soul" [...] is ritually transferred from his head to a pot, and the head is repainted. On {{the evening of the}} 14thday, a [...] high post is erected on a processional chariot. The post will support Aravan's head and body later in the festival. After the post-setting ceremony (kampam niruttatal), young and middle-aged men (farmers and traders from Koovagam and surrounding villages) who <b>have</b> <b>vowed</b> to marry Aravan purchase thalis—the traditional mark of a married woman, in this case a pendant with a piece of turmeric at its centre. The priest, representing Aravan, ties the thalis around their necks in the inner sanctum of the temple. Even married men and men afflicted with diseases, all dressed as women, are described as ritually [...] "marrying" [...] Aravan in the festival, to please the deity.|$|E

2500|$|The {{theme of}} revenge is {{introduced}} in the opening scene. Upon seeing York seated on the royal throne, Henry reminds his allies of their conflict with the Yorkists {{in an attempt to}} motivate them; [...] "Earl of Northumberland, [...] slew thy father,/And thine Lord Clifford, and you both <b>have</b> <b>vowed</b> revenge/On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends" [...] (1.1.54–56). Northumberland responds to this with [...] "If I be not, heavens be revenged on me" [...] (1.1.57). Later, after Henry has resigned the crown to the House of York and has been abandoned by Clifford, Westmorland and Northumberland, Exeter explains, [...] "They seek revenge and therefore shall not yield" [...] (1.1.191). Later, after Edward has been installed as king, Oxford refuses to acknowledge him, arguing [...] "Call him my king, by whose injurious doom/My elder brother the Lord Aubrey Vere/Was done to death? And more than so, my father" [...] (3.3.101-102).|$|E
2500|$|On June 25, 2004, Watkins and Thomas {{announced}} that they were pitching a reality television show that was eventually picked up for development by UPN. Titled R U the Girl, the show debuted on July 27, 2005. Despite media speculation that {{the winner of the}} series was to become a new, permanent member of TLC, Watkins and Thomas <b>have</b> <b>vowed</b> to never replace Lopes with a new member. The winner of the show, 20-year-old Tiffany [...] "O'so Krispie" [...] Baker, recorded with Watkins and Thomas on a new song, [...] "I Bet", and perform it together in a live concert finale in Atlanta. Roughly 4.1 million viewers tuned in for the season finale of R U The Girl on September 20, 2005. [...] "I Bet" [...] was released to radio and iTunes on October 4, 2005, but failed to make onto the charts. The song later became a bonus track on Now & Forever: The Hits.|$|E
2500|$|Testing of the JLTV was {{temporarily}} halted in early October during the two-week U.S. Government shutdown of 2013. [...] Civilian workers were furloughed and test sites were closed within hours. [...] Work restarted immediately when the shutdown ended, though one site remained closed until 22 October. [...] The Army and Marine Corps <b>have</b> <b>vowed</b> commitment to buying nearly 55,000 JLTVs {{even in the}} face of sequestration cuts. [...] This level of support is given while major acquisition programs like the Ground Combat Vehicle were in danger of cuts (and eventually cancelled), which potentially meant the Army was favoring replacing Humvees more than the M2 Bradley. [...] Army leaders worried that the Marines' priority with the Amphibious Combat Vehicle program could cause them to back out of JLTV procurement. [...] However, the Marines said procurement plans for the two efforts did not overlap and should not conflict with each other. [...] The number of light vehicles that will need to be reduced due to cuts is still being determined, but it is hoped that the cuts will be directed to the existing Humvee fleet rather than planned JLTV numbers.|$|E

2500|$|This is {{a normal}} guitar that resembles a GHI Guitar made in Japan in the 1960s. It has a 1950s Harmony pickup added with duct tape, and is tuned to G, G, and B (middle G is one octave higher than the bottom). This is how to set it up: Remove the low E string, put about a [...]049 string in the A string {{position}} tuned to G, remove the D string, put about a [...]028 string tuned to G in the G string position, put about a [...]018 string tuned to B in the B position, and remove the high E string. He was given the guitar by {{a friend who had}} had it nailed to his wall as a decoration, but at his gigs, he often tells the story that he bought it for US$75 in this condition from a man who later told him he only paid US$25 for it the day before, and claims to <b>have</b> <b>vowed</b> never to add another string, and that he would tour the world telling his story of how the seller ripped him off. [...] A lot of the time he also adds, while picking up or putting away the guitar, that it is the [...] "biggest piece of shit in the world, I swear." [...] In a BBC interview Wold claimed that the guitar was found by a friend, just with the three strings on it, and he decided to keep it that way.|$|E
2500|$|On September 16, 2010, the Allegheny County Sports and Exhibition Authority voted {{unanimously}} to demolish the Civic Arena. SEA Board chairman, State Senator Wayne Fontana, DBrookline, said the board's decision will not be final unless someone comes forward with a better idea {{on the use of}} the Arena. During the summer of 2010, workers removed asbestos from the building while a demolition plan was designed. The board also decided to sell assets (handled by the auction company Asset Auctions) from inside and would later award a demolition contract in February 2011. Proponents for retaining the building <b>have</b> <b>vowed</b> to fight the demolition decision in court, and continue to seek landmark status. On November 24, 2010, the building's demolition was delayed due to a last-minute nomination as a National Historic Landmark. Also, on January 5, 2011, the Pittsburgh Historic Review Commission voted 5–1 in favor for preliminary approval of the arena's historic nomination status. The vote paved the way for a formal hearing on the proposed designation on March 2. The HRC ultimately voted against landmark status on March 2. After also failing to get historic status approval from City Planning and City Council, Preservation Pittsburgh filed a federal lawsuit in another attempt to save the arena. The 3rd appeals court denied the lawsuit saying it had no jurisdiction in the matter, and demolition began Monday, September 26, 2011. The demolition is not a traditional type of demolition for sports arenas. In November 2011, the Penguins started selling Christmas ornaments crafted from the Civic Arena's steel roof. The team used the promotion to raise money for its charitable foundation. Grove City-based Wendell August Forge, the oldest and largest forge in the United States, created two types of ornaments: one with the arena and the Pittsburgh skyline and another with the arena with the Penguins' logo. The Penguins had originally planned to sell 6,000 ornaments, but due to demand, the team ended selling over 40,000 pieces. The arena was being disassembled over time, and originally expected to be complete in May 2012. However, demolition was finished early as the last panel of the retractable roof fell down on March 31, 2012. A timelapse video on YouTube breaks down 9 months of Civic Arena demolition work in just 31 seconds. It is called [...] "THE DISAPPEARING CIVIC ARENA".|$|E
