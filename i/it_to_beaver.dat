5|$|Work for {{the actors}} began in 2010. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology. Dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles {{was recorded in}} studios. Because the actors had their dialogue and movements recorded on-set, they found their performances no different to film or television roles. Their dialogue was scripted such {{that they could not}} ad-lib; however they sometimes made small changes to the performance with directorial approval. To prepare for his role as Michael, Luke gained 25 pounds and studied Rockstar's previous games, starting with Grand Theft Auto IV. He considered Michael's characterisation to be an amalgamation of Hugh Beaumont's portrayal of Ward Cleaver in the American sitcom Leave <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> (1957–63) and Al Pacino's portrayal of Tony Montana in the 1983 film Scarface.|$|E

Largely due to its low population, Erinsville has only a few commercial business in operation. These include the the Beaver Lake Variety and Gas Bar abd the Lakeview Tavern and Restaurant. Several residents also run small businesses from home, such as bait shops and PocketWatchPurveyor.com. Erinsville also is the site of the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a Roman Catholic parish.|$|R
5000|$|North American beavers (Castor canadensis) {{historically}} flourished on the river. In {{an historical}} account, George C.

50|$|Geneva College {{was founded}} in Northwood, Ohio in 1848, but <b>it</b> moved <b>to</b> {{northern}} <b>Beaver</b> County in 1880 after being offered free land by the Harmony Society, which was highly influential in Beaver Falls. After the college was established on land just north of Beaver Falls, a community grew up around it, and in 1892, it was incorporated as the borough of College Hill. In 1932, forty years after its incorporation, it merged with Beaver Falls.|$|R
5000|$|That North American beaver (Castor canadensis) {{were once}} {{native to the}} Walker River is {{evidenced}} by a 1906 article in the Nevada State Journal newspaper by newspaper mining writer Fitz-James MacCarthy (aka Fitz-Mac) stated that the Mason's Valley of the Walker River in Yerington, Nevada was well known to [...] "the early trappers and fur hunters...Kit Carson knew <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the bone...The <b>beavers</b> of course were all trapped long ago, and you never see an elk nowadays..."

5000|$|During the 1830s, the Rev. J. B. Johnston, {{pastor of}} the Miami Reformed Presbyterian Church in Northwood, began {{teaching}} a small classical school in his study. Friends and relatives, noticing the popularity of his classes, began to suggest {{the opening of a}} small college in the area. Eventually, Geneva Hall was opened in the spring of 1848, partially under the oversight of the Lakes Presbytery of the Reformed Presbyterian Church. Despite its initial popularity, the school soon failed for lack of money and support. At the end of the Civil War, Geneva was reopened as a school for freedmen and soon began to educate whites as well. The community received a post office on November 24, 1868. During the 1870s, its name was changed from Geneva Hall to Geneva College, and the college became significant enough that the town's name was changed to [...] "West Geneva". Although the college flourished, <b>it</b> moved <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> Falls, Pennsylvania in 1880, largely because of Northwood's lack of a railroad and because of greater financial possibilities there.|$|R

25|$|In {{spite of}} solid and {{consistent}} ratings, Leave <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> never {{climbed into the}} Nielsen's top-30 though similar sitcoms of the period like Father Knows Best, The Donna Reed Show, The Real McCoys, and Dennis the Menace managed to do so.|$|E
25|$|The series entered {{syndication}} in {{many cities}} four days following completion of the ABC summer repeats. By the mid-1970s, the show was only on in a few markets, {{one of which was}} Atlanta, Georgia on Ted Turner's Channel 17, WTCG. In 1976, when WTGC went on satellite and became a Superstation available nationwide, Leave <b>It</b> <b>To</b> <b>Beaver</b> was exposed nationwide. From the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, Leave <b>It</b> <b>To</b> <b>Beaver</b> gained in popularity. In Chicago, the show aired on a shaky independent station 44 WSNS. But when WSNS began to phase in subscription TV in 1980, they did not renew and WGN-TV, which also became a Superstation picked it up. So in the early 1980s the show was airing in most large, major, and medium TV markets. Still, TBS and WGN showed it for many years in the late 1980s and into the 90s (TBS sometimes running it back-to-back with the New Leave <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> on occasion), and briefly on Nick at Nite from July 12, 2002 – August 10, 2002 as part of TV Land Sampler. It aired on TV Land in July 1998 where it has been shown until November 2012. Today, NBC Universal Television owns the syndication rights and all properties related to the series.|$|E
50|$|Geneva College (and the Macartneys with <b>it)</b> moved <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> Falls, Pennsylvania in 1880. In 1894, in {{response}} to John's respiratory problems, {{the family moved to}} Redlands, California, and then to Claremont in 1895 when John took up a post at Pomona College. In 1896, the family moved again, to Denver, but Clarence stayed behind to finish high school in Claremont before enrolling in the University of Denver in 1897. At this point, two of Clarence's older brothers, who were pastors in Wisconsin, convinced the family to move to Madison, so Clarence transferred to the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He majored in English literature and graduated in 1901. In 1901, he moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts to pursue graduate work at Harvard, but grew frustrated and spent a year travelling in England, Scotland, and France. Upon his return he briefly returned <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> Falls <b>to</b> visit another brother and worked as a reporter with the Beaver Times. In 1902, he enrolled in Yale Divinity School, though, still restless, he departed after one class, and transferred to Princeton Theological Seminary, where another brother was enrolled. It was about this time that Macartney's religious and vocational drift ended; he rejected the liberal values of Wisconsin-Madison and Yale; and threw himself behind the doctrines of Old School Presbyterianism taught at Princeton. His professors included B. B. Warfield, Francis Patton, Robert Dick Wilson, and, his personal favorite, church historian Frederick Loetscher.|$|R
50|$|When I-15 was {{completed}} {{north of town}} in 1964, SR-1 was rerouted as <b>it</b> left <b>Beaver</b> <b>to</b> connect with the new interstate, following the same route as SR-161. As a result, SR-161 was withdrawn to avoid the two state routes overlapping. In 1969, the rest of SR-1 through the town was realigned with I-15. As a result, SR-160 was extended northward to follow the former route of SR-1 along main street north through town, then turning northwest to the interchange at I-15.|$|R

25|$|The {{show was}} created by the writers Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher. These {{veterans}} of radio and early television found inspiration for the show's characters, plots and dialogue in the lives, experiences and conversations of their own children. Leave <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> {{is one of the first}} primetime sitcom series written from a child's point of view. Like several television dramas and sitcoms of the late 1950s and early 1960s (Lassie and My Three Sons), Leave <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> is a glimpse of middle-class American boyhood. In a typical episode, Beaver gets into some sort of boyish scrape, then faces his parents for reprimand and correction. Neither parent was omniscient; the series often showed the parents debating their approach to child rearing, and some episodes were built around parental gaffes.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} two seasons, Leave <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> was filmed at Republic Studios in Studio City, Los Angeles. For its final four seasons, {{production}} moved to Universal Studios. Exteriors, including the façades of the two Cleaver houses, were filmed on the respective studio back lots. Stock footage was often used for establishing shots.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} of how children {{interact with their}} brothers and sisters on such 1950s situation comedy television programs as Leave <b>It</b> <b>To</b> <b>Beaver</b> and Father Knows Best with those on such 1980s programs as The Cosby Show and Family Ties found that children interacted more positively in the early period but were important and central – if more conflictual – to the main story action in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Leave <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> faced stiff {{competition}} in its time slots. During its {{next to last}} season, for example, the show ran against The Defenders, a program examining highly charged courtroom cases about abortion and the death penalty. In its final season, the show was up against Perry Mason and Dr. Kildare but was in the ABC line-up with television greats The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, The Donna Reed Show, and My Three Sons.|$|E
25|$|The show's chief writers, Bob Mosher and Joe Connelly, {{met while}} working in New York City for the J. Walter Thompson Agency. Once in Hollywood, the men became head writers for the radio show Amos 'n' Andy and {{continued}} to write the well-received show when it moved to CBS television in 1950. Although both men initially wrote all the scripts for earlier episodes of Leave <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Beaver,</b> after becoming executive producers they began accepting scripts from other writers, refining them, if necessary.|$|E
25|$|Universal Studios Home Entertainment {{released}} {{the first two}} seasons of Leave <b>It</b> <b>to</b> <b>Beaver</b> on DVD in Region 1 in 2005/2006. Season one was released in two versions: an inexpensive cardboard slip-cased collection and a costlier version in which the DVDs were contained in a retro-styled, plastic photo album tucked inside a plaid metal lunch box displaying portraits of the cast on its exterior. Both of these seasons were released in the troublesome DVD-18 format which plagued many of Universal Studios' boxed set releases.|$|E
40|$|Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) live {{in family}} groups that defend territories against other conspecifics. Part of this {{territorial}} defence involves constructing scent mounds near the stream bank within territories and marking them with castoreum, a urine-based fluid from the castor sacs, and (or) anal-gland secretion. The {{aim of this}} study was to test the hypothesis that Eurasian beavers show one or more forms of territorial behavior when an intruder, simulated in the form of experimental scent mounds (ESMs), has scent-marked inside the territory. We predicted that beavers would show a stronger response to ESMs with castoreum than to those without. Results showed that 85 % of all beaver families (N = 20) made one or more behavioral responses to ESMs marked with castoreum from foreign adult males, whereas no ESMs presented without castoreum received a response. We therefore conclude that a main function of territorial marking by <b>beavers</b> is <b>to</b> advertise spatially related dominance status, thereby providing opportunities for intruders to assess the presence of the owner and reducing the cost and risks of agonistic conflict for both the owner and intruders. Additionally, <b>it</b> appears <b>to</b> be the scent emitted from an ESM and not the sight of <b>it</b> <b>to</b> which <b>beavers</b> respond...|$|R
