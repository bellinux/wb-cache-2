40|$|Particle and defect {{issues related}} to <b>electrostatic</b> <b>chucking</b> with an ultra-planar, pin-structured mask chuck for EUVL {{application}} were addressed. By mapping particles/defects on the backside of 8 inch Si-wafers before and after chucking, particle transport from the chuck to the wafer was studied at application relevant electrostatic forces. Particles were detected by analysis of stray light intensities on the wafer side. Investigations were performed under ambient conditions at high chucking voltages on a bipolar chuck. Particle transport from the chuck surface to the wafer surface was mapped and found to concentrate at the pin sites.

To quantify the influence of environmental conditions, electrostatic forces for various chuck dielectrics were measured under ambient conditions (humid air), dry nitrogen and in vacuum. The forces are found to be significantly reduced at ambient conditions as compared to the vacuum case. When flushing with dry nitrogen, the vacuum level is essentially retained. Clearly, water at the chuck-to-wafer interface reduces the chucking force. We suspect that dissociation of water occurs, entailing ionic charge transport and trapping in the dielectric.

40|$|Abstract. In general, <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>chuck</b> (ESC) {{was used}} to fix and clamp the silicon wafer with {{electrostatic}} force in the semiconductor fabrication process. Recently, due to their excellent chemical and plasma stability and high thermal conductivity, sintered ceramics {{has been used as}} an insulator material in the configuration of ESC. However, metals of high melting point, such as Mo, W, still used for electrode materials. Because of the thermal mismatch between metal electrode and ceramic insulator, micro cracks were produced at the interface during sintering process of ceramic or its operation process with high temperature, which leads to reduce the life time of ESC. To improve the compatibility between metal and ceramic, mesh type metal electrode was used in ESC but this type of electrode results in inhomogeneous electrostatic force. Homogeneous clamping force is very important to determine the final quality of semiconductor. We have investigated a ceramic <b>electrostatic</b> <b>chuck</b> composed of conducting ceramic electrode of titanium nitride instead of metal electrode. Aluminum nitride was added to titanium nitride to control the thermal expansion coefficient. This composite electrode shows not only a good electrical conductivity but also an excellent compatibility to dielectric layer. Compatibility between the electrode and dielectric layer enable to design the electrode with continuous sheet type which leads to homogeneous electrostatic force.

40|$|The {{successful}} implementation of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) for patterning in the sub- 32 nm regime will require significant improvements in image placement (IP) accuracy {{over the next few}} years. The IP error budget for the mask system is extremely stringent; consequently, the reduction or elimination of all sources of error is essential. One potential source of IP error is the effect of the residual nonflatness of the patterned surface of the mask during exposure scanning. The focus {{of this article is to}} characterize the clamping ability of a Coulombic <b>electrostatic</b> pin-type <b>chuck</b> and to assess its ability to adequately flatten an EUVL mask.

For proper {{control of the}} chucked mask under corresponding inertial forces, static friction of the mask on the chuck is critical and an important input parameter for reliable theoretical modelling. To determine static and dynamic friction values, measurements were performed in vacuum on a mask blank with a test chuck, smaller than a real EUVL mask chuck, but otherwise nearly identical in its characteristics. Experimental results were obtained at various voltages for a materials combination of Low Thermal Expansion Glass (LTEM) for the pin chuck surface and a mask blank with a chromium metal backside metallisation, respectively.

30|$|Electrostatic force {{measurement}} at the micro/nano scale {{is of great}} significance in science and engineering. In this paper, a reasonable way of applying voltage is put forward by taking an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>chuck</b> in a real integrated circuit manufacturing process as a sample, applying voltage in the probe and the sample electrode, respectively, and comparing the measurement effect of the probe oscillation phase difference by amplitude modulation atomic force microscopy. Based on the phase difference obtained from the experiment, the quantitative dependence of the absolute magnitude of the electrostatic force on the tip-sample distance and applied voltage is established by means of theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. The {{results show that the}} varying characteristics of the electrostatic force with the distance and voltage at the micro/nano scale are similar to those at the macroscopic scale. Electrostatic force gradually decays with increasing distance. Electrostatic force is basically proportional to the square of applied voltage. Meanwhile, the applicable conditions of the above laws are discussed. In addition, a comparison of the results in this paper with the results of the energy dissipation method shows the two are consistent in general. The error decreases with increasing distance, and the effect of voltage on the error is small.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aluminum Nitride (AlN) {{ceramics}} {{are used}} as wafer heating plates and wafer holding <b>electrostatic</b> <b>chucks</b> in semiconductor fabrication equipments. For tailoring the electrical resistivity {{to satisfy the requirements}} of each component, several kinds of approaches were investigated for hot-pressed AlN ceramics. Three techniques to control the electrical resistivity of AlN ceramics were adopted: (1) AlN intragranular control, (2) intergranular phase control and (3) incorporation of electrically conductive second phase particles. In this paper, we introduce examples of each technique. The first one is addition of a small amount of Y 2 O 3. The resistivity varied from 1015 Ωcm to 1010 Ωcm with the Y 2 O 3 amount.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Over {{the past}} two decades, electroactive {{polymers}} (EAP) have been studied as a material for soft actuator and sensor systems. Dielectric elastomers (DE) are an EAP material which relies on the electrostatic force produced on compliant electrodes to produce deformation. In the converse sense, DE sensors {{can be used by}} measuring the electrical energy or impedance change produced under deformation. The two key limitations barring DE from commercial use are high driving voltage, and low output force. The scope of this work is as follows: to improve upon these two limitations by processing of actuators by a pneumatic dispenser, by adding tactile sensing and variable stiffness properties to the actuators, and developing a mechanical model to predict the actuator behavior. This work focuses specifically on the unimorph dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA), which consists of a DE laminate which contracts in the thickness direction and expands in-plane under applied voltage, and is constrained on one face by a passive material, resulting in bending of the structure. The first part of the work is devoted to fabrication, modeling, and characterization of multilayer unimorph DEA. Fabrication is done using two schemes – the first is a conventional one, using commercially available DE films, and the second is a novel method using a robotic dispenser system. The latter technique has two objectives. The first is to reduce the thickness of the DE layers to reduce driving voltage, since the DE deformation is proportional to the square of the applied electric field which itself is inversely proportional to electrode separation. The second is to deposit higher-performance DE materials, in this case, PVDF terpolymer, which exhibits large actuation stresses because of its high dielectric constant and relatively high Young’s modulus. Using the dispenser, DE layers with 10 µm thick layers are repeatably produced, requiring actuation voltages one order of magnitude less than conventional thick DE films. Standard deviation of displacement and blocking force do not exceed 10 % and 15 % of the mean after 2 minutes of deformation, respectively. Elastic and viscoelastic models are developed for multilayer unimorph DEA consisting of flat and curved geometries. Both models were validated in comparison with experimental data with the latter shown to agree with the experimental data to within one standard deviation of the mean for majority of the deformation. The second section demonstrates the novel use of electrolaminates to create variable stiffness DEA (VSDEA). Variable stiffness structures are of particular interest for soft actuators, because they allow switching between a low stiffness, high displacement mode and a high stiffness mode with large holding force. One device is demonstrated by simply utilizing the passive layer of a DEA as part of an electrolaminate, allowing for four-fold increase in bending rigidity. Another device is demonstrated consisting of a bundle of parallel DEA with <b>electrostatic</b> <b>chucking</b> features to modulate shear strength of the interfaces. This device exhibits a 39 -fold increase in stiffness, and a claw actuator using these actuators is capable of lifting an object 17 times its own weight. The final part of this work investigates two novel tactile sensors based on dielectric elastomers (DES). The first uses a dome-shaped protrusion to redistribute tactile forces onto an array of four capacitive sensors. The change in capacitance of the four sensors is used to measure and discriminate the force components of the impinging force. An array of these dome DES are fabricated using the dispenser system, and the ability to differentiate between normal and shear forces was demonstrated, as well as its proximity sensing ability. The tactile sensor array is also shown integrated as the passive layer of a DEA, providing tactile and proximity sensing capability to the actuator. The second tactile sensor features high resolution and scalability, and is built in to a medical assistive device coined the “artery mapper” and is used to determine the location of a target artery for arterial line placement. It is demonstrated locating an artery on a test subject, possible due to its force resolution on the order of 2. 8 kPa...|$|R
40|$|The {{backside}} of photomasks {{have been largely}} ignored during {{the last several decades}} of development, with the exception of avoiding gross damage or defects, as almost all problems are far enough out of the focal plane to have minimal effect on imaging. Since EUV masks are reflective, and the column is held in a vacuum, scanners have been designed to utilize electrostatic chucking. With the chucking system for EUV, the requirements for the {{backside of}} the mask must be redefined to integrate concerns in substrate design, mask manufacturing, and usage. The two key concerns with respect to an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>chuck</b> are defects and durability. Backside defects can affect imaging, while potentially damaging or contaminating the tool, the mask, or even subsequently used masks. Compromised durability, from either usage or cleaning, can affect the ability of the chuck to hold the mask in place. In this study, these concerns are evaluated in three stages: minimizing defects created during mask fabrication, actions taken upon discovery of defects, and durability of the backside film with continued cleans and chucking. Data incorporated in this study includes: sheet resistance, film thickness, and optical inspection images. Incorporating the data from the three stages of fabrication, disposition, and lifetime will help us define how to structure backside EUV mask handling during mask manufacture and indicate what further solutions are needed as EUV technology transitions into manufacturing...|$|E
40|$|The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors for Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) places strict {{requirements}} {{on the quality}} and flatness of the substrate and patterned mask. The SEMI EUVL Mask Substrate Standard (SEMI P 37) specifies that the substrate frontside and backside nonflatness {{be no more than}} 50 nm peak-to-valley (p-v). Recent technological advances in polishing and finishing techniques have placed the 50 nm p-v specification within reach. A key ingredient in the development of EUVL is understanding and characterizing the clamping ability of the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>chuck</b> and the resulting effect on the flatness of the chucked mask. By implementing the shape of a representative EUVL mask surface into a numerical model, the effect of electrostatic chucking on the shape of the mask was determined. Legendre polynomials have been identified as an effective and efficient means of representing EUVL mask surface shapes. Finite element (FE) models have been developed to utilize the Legendre coefficients as input data to define the surfaces of an EUVL mask. The FE models were then used to determine the clamping response of the mask. In particular, the maximum mask-to-chuck gap within the Flatness Quality Area and over the entire mask has been tracked as a function of clamping pressure for representative EUVL surfaces. One ofthe important parameters in this study was the chuck's mechanical stiffness (comprised of the thickness and modulus). The flatness of the EUVL mask also depends on the intrinsic stress and thickness of the multilayer and backside layers. The results in this paper show that the recent advances in EUVL substrate polishing have resulted in masks that can be chucked relatively flat...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} {{theoretical}} and experimental investigations into <b>electrostatic</b> <b>chuck</b> designs {{for use in}} future e-beam lithography on 450 mm Silicon wafers. Ultra-low thermal expansion glass (ULE) and Si infiltrated Silicon Carbide (SiSiC) designs were evaluated by finite element modeling, subject to a mass budget of 8 kg. In addition to massive chucks, light-weight designs were created by applying bore holes through the chuck body below its surface. Considerable chuck bending under gravity is observed with classical kinematic 3 -point mounts. Out-of-plane distortions of about 1250 (650) nm and 400 (200) nm for the massive and light-weight designs of ULE (SiSiC), respectively, were calculated. The corresponding surface in-plane distortions for a chucked Si wafer of standard thickness 925 ?m amount to about 3 (1. 6) nm for the massive and 1 (0. 5) nm for light-weight designs of ULE (SiSiC), respectively. By using the standard 6 th order polynomial correction upon e-beam writing, these values {{can be reduced to}} ? 0. 7 nm for the massive designs with both materials. Various pin-pattern configurations for an ideally flat chuck surface were adopted to determine resulting wafer bending under the influence of electrostatic forces. At a typical electrostatic pressure of about 18 kPa, a square pin pattern of pin-pitch 3. 5 mm and pin-diameter 0. 5 mm results in wafer in-plane distortions < 0. 5 nm, which is considered tolerable for obtaining the desired total overlay accuracy of < 4 nm. The pin structure manufacturing process for a corresponding ULE chuck surface was experimentally tested and verified. A nearly elliptic ULE plate, slightly larger than the wafer, was structured with a Chromium hard-mask and subjected to low pressure reactive ion etching to generate the pin-pattern. A homogeneity of about 7 % was obtained for the etching process, which is fully sufficient with respect to resulting variations in electrostatic attraction...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of microelectronics, and in {{particular}} the fabrication of microelectronics during plasma etching processes, electrostatic chucks have been used to hold silicon wafers during the plasma etching process. Current electrostatic chucks that operate by the {open_quotes}Johnson-Rahbek Effect{close_quotes} consist of a metallic base plate that is typically coated with a thick layer of slightly conductive dielectric material. A silicon wafer of approximately {{the same size as the}} chuck is placed on top of the chuck and a potential difference of several hundred volts is applied between the silicon and the base plate of the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>chuck.</b> This causes an electrostatic attraction proportional to the square of the electric field in the gap between the silicon wafer and the chuck face. When the chuck is used in a plasma filled chamber the electric potential of the wafer tends to be fixed by the effective potential of the plasma. The purpose of the dielectric layer on the chuck is to prevent the silicon wafer from coming into direct electrical contact with the metallic part of the chuck and shorting out the potential difference. On the other hand, a small amount of conductivity appears to be desirable in the dielectric coating so that much of its free surface between points of contact with the silicon wafer is maintained near the potential of the metallic base plate; otherwise, a much larger potential difference would be needed to produce a sufficiently large electric field in the vacuum gap between the wafer and chuck. Typically, the face of the chuck has a pattern of grooves in which about 10 torr pressure of helium gas is maintained. This gas provides cooling (thermal contact) between the wafer and the chuck. A pressure of 10 torr is equivalent to about 0. 2 psi...|$|E
