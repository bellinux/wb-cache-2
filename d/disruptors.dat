5|$|Elite Force {{includes}} {{an arsenal of}} Star Trek–themed weapons, such as phasers and <b>disruptors.</b> The weapons vary in power, ammunition consumption and effectiveness in given situations. Usually, the player {{is equipped with a}} hand phaser, a low-damage weapon that automatically recharges ammunition, and a phaser compression rifle, a more powerful weapon with an optional sniper mode for long distance kills. Other weapons, acquired as the game progresses, include grenade launchers, stasis weaponry and pulse energy weapons. The player can restock on ammunition by using wall-mounted terminals that dispense weapon energy, or by picking up certain items in the game environment.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a one-page visual tool for adaptively planning and managing potentially disruptive business models {{such as in}} RFID-Startups. The visual tool is called “The <b>Disruptor’s</b> Arrow of Time.” The modular and iterative approach of the <b>Disruptor’s</b> Arrow of Time overcomes a serious limitation of Waterfall Business Planning, which rigidly focuses on a single chain of activities from planning to execution. Unlike in Waterfall Business Planning, the <b>Disruptor’s</b> Arrow of Time uses a business model as unit of analysis, planning, design, and innovation. The <b>Disruptor’s</b> Arrow of Time uses a four-stage process for business model planning and management. To illustrate benefits of using the <b>Disruptor’s</b> Arrow of Time, the tool is used to present a case study on the systematic development and validation of a disruptive business model such as for Zipcar, which is an RFID-startup. Zipcar’s example highlights the flexibility and effectiveness of the <b>Disruptor’s</b> Arrow of Time in adaptively planning and managing disruptive business models particularly in the emerging epoch of the Internet of Things.|$|R
40|$|The {{studies in}} this thesis {{are focused on the}} impact the {{presence}} of a network <b>disruptor</b> has on network formation models. In particular, we build two theoretical models to study the effect of network disruption on network formation and test the effect network disruption has on equilibrium selection in a laboratory experiment. We find that the network <b>disruptor</b> in each model we study has a significant effect on network formation and equilibrium selection. We first present a structural model of network design and disruption by modeling a two-stage full information game between a network designer and a network <b>disruptor.</b> We first investigate the threat of attack on the links of the network and then on the nodes of a network. Our results show that in a purely structural model between a network designer and a network <b>disruptor</b> the presence of a network <b>disruptor</b> leads to the network designer using additional links to build a robust network for relatively low linking costs and not connecting all nodes in one component for high linking costs. Thus, the network <b>disruptor</b> has a mostly negative effect, leading to over - or underconnectedness as compared to a benchmark case without a network <b>disruptor.</b> In the second part of this dissertation we then use the knowledge gained from this purely structural approach and look at the incentives of individual subjects in a network formation game, when the presence of a network <b>disruptor</b> is common knowledge. We introduce a network <b>disruptor</b> who can target the links of a network to a model of network formation in which the players are assumed to be rational, self-interested and myopic. In such a model in which the nodes themselves are individual players, the effect of a network <b>disruptor</b> is ambivalent. For low linking costs it leads to overconnectedness as compared to the benchmark case. However, for high linking costs it may lead to an increase in efficiency as connected networks are pairwise stable, while in the benchmark case only the empty network is pairwise stable. Finally in the network formation experiment, we find that overall groups almost exclusively reach an equilibrium network. They reach the empty network more often than the other two equilibria and also significantly more often when a network <b>disruptor</b> is present than when there is no <b>disruptor.</b> We test two competing hypotheses on the effect of a network <b>disruptor</b> on equilibrium selection, as his influence is either on the forwardlookingness of players or on their perceived risk. We find that the influence on the perceived risk is the dominant result. This implies that players will often end up in the empty network instead of a connected network. Overall the effect a network <b>disruptor</b> has on a network formation model thus depends on the model itself, as well as the costs of links and the possible equilibria. However, in all variants we have shown in this dissertation the presence of a network <b>disruptor</b> has a significant effect on the optimal network structure...|$|R

500|$|<b>Disruptor</b> was {{released}} to positive critical reception, {{and was named}} [...] "Dark Horse of the Year" [...] by various gaming publications.

25|$|A {{wide range}} of {{beneficial}} effects of phytoestrogens on the cardiovascular, metabolic, central nervous systems as well as reduction of risk of cancer and post menopausal symptoms have been claimed.

25|$|Other {{factors such}} as toxicants can {{adversely}} impact bone cells. Infections, chronic or acute, can affect blood flow by inducing platelet activation and aggregation, contributing to a localized state of excess coagulability (hypercoagulability) that may contribute to clot formation (thrombosis), a known cause of bone infarct and ischaemia. Exogenous estrogens, also called hormonal <b>disruptors,</b> have been linked with an increased tendency to clot (thrombophilia) and impaired bone healing.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} also looks at DES {{in the third}} generation. These are the grandchildren of women who were given DES during pregnancy and whose mother or father was therefore exposed to DES in utero. Studies of the third generation are important because DES might be associated with epigenetic changes, which involve changes to the way genes behave (not involving the DNA itself) that may be heritable {{from one generation to}} another. If epigenetic changes occur and are heritable, studies of the DES-exposed third generation have implications for the influence of environmental endocrine <b>disruptors</b> on human health and evolution.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 the European Union's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) {{reviewed}} {{the safety of}} DEHP in medical devices. The SCENIHR report states that certain medical procedures used in high risk patients result in a significant exposure to DEHP and concludes {{there is still a}} reason for having some concerns about the exposure of prematurely born male babies to medical devices containing DEHP. The Committee said there are some alternative plasticizers available for which there is sufficient toxicological data to indicate a lower hazard compared to DEHP but added that the functionality of these plasticizers should be assessed before they can be used as an alternative for DEHP in PVC medical devices. Risk assessment results have shown positive results regarding the safe use of High Molecular Weight Phthalates. They have all been registered for REACH and do not require any classification for health and environmental effects, nor are they on the Candidate List for Authorisation. High phthalates are not CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction), neither are they considered endocrine <b>disruptors.</b>|$|E
25|$|Certain toxicants act as {{endocrine}} <b>disruptors</b> by {{interacting with}} the androgen receptor. DDE {{is one example of}} a chemical that acts via this mechanism. DDE is a metabolite of DDT that is widespread in the environment. Although production of DDT has been banned in the Western world, this chemical is extremely persistent and is still commonly found in the environment along with its metabolite DDE. DDE is an antiandrogen, which means it alters the expression of specific androgen-regulated genes, and is an androgen receptor (AR)-mediated mechanism. DDE is a lipophilic compound which diffuses into the cell and binds to the AR. Through binding, the receptor is inactivated and cannot bind to the androgen response element on DNA. This inhibits the transcription of androgen-responsive genes which can have serious consequences for exposed wildlife. In 1980, there was a spill in Lake Apopka, Florida which released the pesticide dicofol and DDT along with its metabolites. The neonatal and juvenile alligators present in this lake have been extensively studied and observed to have altered plasma hormone concentrations, decreased clutch viability, increased juvenile mortality, and morphological abnormalities in the testis and ovary.|$|E

A giant machine known as the Doomsday Machine now roams space, obliterating whole worlds in its path, its origin unknown. Having detected its approach five months ago, our Federation engineers began production of the Proto-Mater Fusion <b>Disruptor,</b> a powerful new device we believe to be capable of stopping the giant machine. Just as the planet killer entered the bounds of Federation space, a fully functional <b>Disruptor</b> was being installed on the U.S.S.

25|$|Elements {{of these}} almost {{forgotten}} fan productions shaped {{many aspects of}} the game. The Technical Manual itself decided the main functions of the Federation Heavy Cruiser, and what other Federation ships looked like. A set of blueprints (probably those drawn by Michael McMaster in 1975) showed the Klingon D7 as having more phasers than the Heavy Cruiser, and <b>disruptors</b> mounted on the engines. The latter became a common feature of Klingon shipbuilding, and the former led to the idea of less powerful phasers for the Klingons. The same blueprints also stated that an older, slightly inferior version of the D7, the D6, was what was sold to the Romulans, and the D7/D6 dichotomy has been {{at the heart of the}} Klingon fleet in the game ever since. Two of the novels gave mention of a phaser being mounted on shuttlecraft. This was included, as much to give a reason to use shuttles as anything else. This proved to be the wedge that allowed the introduction of fighters to the game; a feature popular with many players, but also led many to believe that Star Fleet Battles was no longer Star Trek.|$|E
25|$|Dioxins (most {{notably the}} polychlorinated dibenzodioxins) are {{chemicals}} that are produced when chlorinated products are burned, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC). This occurs when chlorinated products {{are used in}} certain manufacturing industries. Dioxins are also added to the air when gasoline and diesel fuels break down. Dioxins are able to bioaccumulate, meaning that they settle and stay in human and animal fat {{for long periods of}} time. There are many different types of dioxins and only a few of them have been labeled by the Environmental Protection Agency as definite human carcinogens and endocrine hormone <b>disruptors.</b> Although dioxins are floating in the air, they eventually settle on plants and other vegetation surfaces. These plants and vegetation are them eaten by cows and other animals. Humans end up eating the produce, milk, eggs, and meat produced by these animals that have consumed dioxin covered vegetation. Dioxins are more harmful when ingested this way. Multiple studies have led to the idea that increased dioxin levels can increase one's risk for breast cancer. A study done in 1976 after a chemical plant explosion in Seveso, Italy concluded that high dioxin level exposure in a woman's body correlated with a more than double chance of developing breast cancer.|$|E
500|$|A 2006 review {{identified}} ten {{other possible}} {{contributors to the}} recent increase of obesity: (1) insufficient sleep, (2) endocrine <b>disruptors</b> (environmental pollutants that interfere with lipid metabolism), (3) decreased variability in ambient temperature, (4) decreased rates of smoking, because smoking suppresses appetite, (5) increased use of medications that can cause weight gain (e.g., atypical antipsychotics), (6) proportional increases in ethnic and age groups that tend to be heavier, (7) pregnancy at a later age (which may cause susceptibility to obesity in children), (8) epigenetic risk factors passed on generationally, (9) natural selection for higher BMI, and (10) assortative mating leading to increased concentration of obesity risk factors (this would [...] {{increase the number of}} obese people by increasing population variance in weight). While there is substantial evidence supporting the influence of these mechanisms on the increased prevalence of obesity, the evidence is still inconclusive, and the authors state that these are probably less influential than the ones discussed in the previous paragraph.|$|E
