For first, it is not improbable, but that the substance of the Moon may be very much like that of our Earth, that is, may consist of an earthy, sandy, or rocky substance, in several of its superficial parts, which parts being agitated, undermin'd, or heav'd up, by eruptions of vapours, may naturally be thrown into the same kind of figured holes, as the small dust, or powder of Alabaster. Next, it is not improbable, but that there may be generated, with{{in the body of the}} Moon, divers such kind of internal fires and heats, as may produce such Exhalations; for since we can plainly enough discover with a Telescope, that there are multitudes of such kind of eruptions in the body of the Sun it self, which is accounted the most noble Ætherial body, certainly we need not be much scandaliz'd at such kind of alterations, or corruptions, in the body of this lower and less considerable part of the universe, the Moon, which is only secundary, or attendant, on the bigger, and more considerable body of the Earth. Thirdly, 'tis not unlikely, but that supposing such a sandy or mouldring substance to be there found, and supposing also a possibility of the generation of the internal <b>elastical</b> body (whether you will call it air or vapours) 'tis not unlikely, I say, but that there is in the Moon a principle of gravitation, such as in the Earth. And to make this probable, I think, we need no better Argument, then the roundness, or globular Figure of the body of the Moon it self, which we may perceive very plainly by the Telescope, to be (bating the small inequality of the Hills and Vales in it, which are all of them likewise shap'd, or levelled, as it were, to answer to the center of the Moons body) perfectly of a Sphærical figure, that is, all the parts of it are so rang'd (bating the comparitively small ruggedness of the Hills and Dales) that the outmost bounds of them are equally distant from the Center of the Moon, and consequently, it is exceedingly probable also, that they are equidistant from the Center of gravitation; and indeed, the figure of the superficial parts of the Moon are so exactly shap'd, according as they should be, supposing it had a gravitating principle as the Earth has, that even the figure of those parts themselves is of sufficient efficacy to make the gravitation, and the other two suppositions probable: so that the other suppositions may be rather prov'd by this considerable Circumstance, or Observation, then this suppos'd Explication can by them; for he that shall attentively observe with an excellent Telescope, how all the Circumstances, notable in the shape of the superficial parts, are, as it were, exactly adapted to suit with such a principle, will, if he well considers the usual method of Nature in its other proceedings, find abundant argument to believe it to have really there also such a principle; for I could never observe, among all the mountainous or prominent parts of the Moon (whereof there is a huge variety) that any one part of it was plac'd in such a manner, that if there should be a gravitating, or attracting principle in the body of the Moon, it would make that part to fall, or be mov'd out of its visible posture. Next, the shape and position of the parts is such, that they all seem put into those very shapes they are in by a gravitating power: For first, there are but very few clifts, or very steep declivities in the ascent of these Mountains; for besides those Mountains, which are by Hevelius call'd the Apennine Mountains, and some other, which seem to border on the Seas of the Moon, and those only upon one side, as is common also in those Hills that are here on the Earth; there are very few that seem to have very steep ascents, but, for the most part, they are made very round, and much resemble the make of the Hills and Mountains also of the Earth; this may be partly perceived by the Hills incompassing this Vale, which I have here describ'd; and as on the Earth also, the middlemost of these Hills seems the highest, so is it obvious also, through a good Telescope, in those of the Moon; the Vales also in many are much shap'd like those of the Earth, and I am apt to think, that could we look upon the Earth from the Moon, with a good Telescope, we might easily enough perceive its surface to be very much like that of the Moon.|$|E

40|$|Wood - based {{composite}} panel products are manufactured from veneer, wood particle, strands or fibres bind together with {{different type of}} adhesives. Delamination {{is one of the}} most important defect which occurs in these products. The aim of this chapter is to review the ultrasonic techniques used for delamination detection. Delamination induces modifications of the mechanical and <b>elastical</b> properties of the materials, which can be observed with ultrasonic techniques. Ultrasonic inspection involves the utilisation of stress waves having a frequency higher then 20 kHz. Linear and non linear ultrasonic techniques have been developed for ultrasonic inspection of wood based composites. Linear techniques have been developed in the hypothesis that the acoustic wave amplitude is infinitesimally small and the response of the material is assumed to be linear tp the excitation signal. Hook law is valid. Under the label of -linear ultrasonic techniques- three main groups of techniques are recognized: the reflexion technique or the pulse echo technique, the transmission technique, and the emission technique. This last technique is not described in this chapter. For ultrasonic signal transmission to the specimens, contact and non contact transducers called also air coupled transducers, can be used. Bulk waves and Lamb waves (plate waves) are used for the mechanical and <b>elastical</b> characterization. Technological advancements with non contact transducers have made possible the development of studies related to the non linear behaviour of materials. For wood-based composites testing the contact transducers are piezoelectric, rather the air coupled transducers can be either piezoelectric or capacitive transducers.

In the concept of <b>elastical</b> stress intensity factors, experiments with four-point-bending bars are not directly comparable with experiments done with tapered-double-cantilever-beam samples. The internal elastic and plastic conditions of the samples are different due to large differences of the load levels applied in both cases. A smooth transition from cleavage to semi-brittle fracture with small, relatively homogeneous plastic zones precedes a sharp transition to general plasticity. The fracture toughness between both transitions is independent of temperature, yielding a plateau region. Numerical simulations qualitatively show the same results. The plateau region is a direct consequence of the shielding dynamics, the sharp transition is a consequence of the assumed emission configuration of the dislocations.

This impact was characterized by investigating the elastic behaviour of 4 wafers (525 mym thick), fixed on a wafer chuck. Induced <b>elastical</b> deformation due to flatness error of the chuck causes strains and elongations in the wafer surface and therefore wafer distortions.

LVH is driven by neurohumoral activation, 15 increased mechanical load and cytokines associated with arterial hypertension, chronic kidney 16 disease, diabetes and other co-morbidities. Here we discuss the experimental and clinical evidence 17 that links LVH to diastolic dysfunction and qualifies LVH as one diagnostic marker for HFpEF. 18 Mechanisms leading to diastolic dysfunction in LVH are incompletely understood but may include 19 extracellular matrix changes, vascular dysfunction as well as altered cardiomyocyte mechano- 20 <b>elastical</b> properties.

Complex Event Processing systems must continuously optimize the event processing to adapt to varying loads without violation of Service Level Agreements. To guarantee efficiency, the optimization cost must be considered, leading to cost savings without violating the Service Level Agreements. In this work, we discuss factors, which should be considered during the optimization of cloud-based Complex Event Processing systems that use the pause-train-resume strategy to migrate operators. Furthermore, we propose heuristics to estimate the cost of these factors. In our experiments, the cost could be decreased by 15 % by using a cost-aware optimizer. This proofs that the costs of cloud-based Complex Event Processing systems can be further decreased if optimization is cost-aware. ...|$|E

The dissection of the media happens in a longitudinal direction and is unexpected. The morphological conditions are still inadequately acquainted and the results which are known so far are controversially discussed. 146 patients with clinical diagnosis of dissection type A were studied. Aim: The goal was to do morphological and morphometrical examinations and to draw conclusions from the morphological changes of the pathology. In detail the following parameters were registered: thickness of the media, strength of the single <b>elastical</b> membranes, size of the interlamellaer space and the volume density of the connective tissue. In addition pathological changes like cystic degenerations, fragmentations {{of the media and}} accumulations of acidic mucopolysaccharids were also recorded. Results: Of a group of 146 patients one third are women. Of all patients studied the average age is 63 years, in almost 80 % you can find an expansion of the interlamellaer space combined with an increased deposition of mucopolysaccharids in small cystic vacuols of the media. Rough pathological-anatomical changes are recognized only in a small number of cases. The intima and the adventitia are hardly affected by these processes. Presently we interpret these results as a consequence of a chronical strain (overload) of the media which can have lots of different reasons...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The coming {{commercialization of}} {{aircraft}} {{has led to}} the investigation of many constructive textile fabrics - Silk, linen, and cotton fabrics are used most commonly. On account of the high cost, the use of silk and linen is limited to a great extent. today mercerized cotton fabric plays the predominating part in the construction of airplane wings. The object of this experiment is to investigate the physical properties of ramie for its possible entering into the realm of its sister fabrics. Ramie is a fiber obtained {{from the base of the}} stingless nettle or Baehmerica tenncissima, which grows best in tropical and sub-tropical countries. The plant is a shrub, reaching four to six feet in height, and is very hardy. It is largely cultivated in China and India. In China it is cultivated in Hupeh, Szechuen Kiangsi, and Kwangtung. In Kwangtung, the local product is made into glass cloth. (Appendix IV) The piece of ramie fabric used in this research was imported from China. The fiber is white in color, but not very <b>elastical</b> and flexible. It can be separated as fine as silk. Its surface is smooth and regular. On this account it lacks cohesion and does not adhere to each other. by William Moy-Ding and Ki Kee Chun. Thesis: B. S., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 1920.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is the problem of {{stability}} and vibration reduction in designed drive systems, in which the essential requirement is to meet the desired dynamic properties. Design/methodology/approach: : The method of stabilisation and reduction has been based on active synthesis, which makes it possible to obtain the desired mechanical effect through the proper selection of dynamic properties of the system, including the calculation of the active force {{as a function of the}} system force feedback. Findings: Presented approach simplifies the process of selecting the dynamical parameters of machine drive systems in view of their dynamical characteristics. Research limitations/implications: The scope of discussion is the synthesis of machine drive systems as discrete models of torsional vibrations. Such vibrations are more difficult to detect than flexural ones, which are accompanied by noise and vibrations of the adjacent elements (for example, shaft frames). Due to the absence of symptoms, torsional vibrations are particularly dangerous, as they may be unnoticeable until the destruction of subsystems occurs. Practical implications: High durability and reliability of drive systems is associated with proper setting of system parameters - inertial, <b>elastical</b> and damping. Proper setting of these parameters is made possible by applying synthesis techniques. Originality/value: We should emphasize that the considered problem varies from other issues met in classic mechanics or control theory.

Serial {{photographs of the}} flow of fluorescein and indocyanine green (ICG) dye are used to determine the areas of the retinal lesions. For objective measurements of features, the registration of the images is a necessity. In this paper, we employ optimization techniques for registration with the help of 2 -parameter translational motion model of retinal angiograms, based on non-linear pre-processing (Wiener filtering and morphological gradient) and computation of the similarity criteria for the alignment of the two gradient images for any given rigid transformation. The optimization methods are effectively employed to minimize the similarity criterion. The presence of noise, the variations in the background and the temporal variation of the fluorescence level pose serious problems in obtaining a robust registration of the retinal images. Moreover, local search strategies are not robust in the case of ICG angiograms, even if one uses a multiresolution approach. The present work makes a systematic comparison of different optimization techniques, namely the minimization method derived from the optical flow formulation, the Nelder-Mead local search and the HCIAC ant colony metaheuristic, each optimizing a similarity criterion for the gradient images. The impact of the resolution and median filtering of gradient image is studied and the robustness of the approaches is tested through experimental studies, performed on macular fluorescein and ICG angiographies. Our proposed optimization techniques have shown interesting results especially for high resolution difficult registration problems.

40|$|Surface {{acoustic}} wave (SAW) measurements are a fast and reliable {{way to get}} information about the <b>elastical</b> properties of thin film coatings, Measuring the surface wave phase velocity which is dependent on frequency and performing the inverse solution of dispersion relation for surface wave propagation in coated materials enable to determine the elastic parameters of the film and substrate material. A measuring equipment is used where wide-band surface wave impulses are generated by short laser pulses and received with a piezoelectric transducer. The surface wave phase velocity is obtained by Fourier transforming the impulse form. In this work {{we are interested in}} Young's modulus of the film material and its relation to the defects in the interface region to the substrate. Young's modulus is a characteristic material parameter, depending on atomic composition and on the microscopic structure of the material. It is theoretically and experimentally established that, if defects like flaws are incorporated, Young's modulus is reduced in comparison to bulk material. The examined samples were steel pieces (42 CrMo 4) coated with TiN by ion plating. During the deposition process we have only varied the duration of the ion etching process, while keeping all other technological parameters constant. The ion etching is responsible for the adhesion of the coating by removing residual contamination from the substrate surface. In this way a more or less non-defective interface zone is built up. The procedure of varying only the etching time allows to get different interface properties while leaving film properties constant. Film properties were characterised by means of Auger-, x-ray texture-, and dynamic hardness measurements. It could be proved that there is a significant correlation between Young's modulus and the etching time. A reduction of the etching time causes a reduction of Young's modulus. Conventional adhesion tests (scratch test) were performed for comparison...|$|E

For this purpose I have analyzed the chronological decay of roof structure elements and made a parametrical study of six static roof structure models. The basic model has four frames with a trapeze shaped triple roof static system Mechanical parameters for the calculation of spruce elements (compressive strength, bending strength, <b>elastical</b> mosulus, shear modulus) for statical analysis were gained by laboratorical testing of spruce samples. I have researched how gradual decay of the roof structure have influenced the deformation of the underlying stone walls. The northern walls are the most damaged with the widest cracks and are almost completely seperated from the rest of the house. Vertical reactions and displacemants of the roof wall plate roller supports were therefore the main focus of this analysis. Dead load, live load, snow load and wind load are assesed using Eurocode standards. Static analysis is based on the method of limit state load (MSN). Analysis shows that the main reason for the north wall deformation is the influence of deformed roof structure and ground setlement. The house is without a foundation and its walls sit directly on rocks that are laying in in soft gravel soil. The house was without gutters and drainage for a long time. Rainwater was therefore able to wash away the soft subgrade causing additional subgrade subsidence. The roof wall plate had to be supported at some point in time, which means that the north wall was without vertical load and consequently constant compressive stress, that had a positive effect on it. As a result the northern wall was able to deform even more. Point supported roof wall plate caused greatly increased horizontal reactions in NE and NW corner of the north wall, that have triggered the beginning of the formation of cracks...|$|E
40|$|Amorphous {{materials}} {{are not new}} to scientists and mankind [...] man has been using glass and glassy materials for centuries. However {{the scientific study of}} amorphous materials did not start until the beginning of this century. The technique solid state amorphization is even newer. The method brings an excellent opportunity to study the structure of amorphous materials due to the relative simplicity of preparation of a large amount of the material. This allows use of some characterisation methods which cannot be easily applied to thin films (e. g. direct compressibility measurements, neutron scattering). It also makes easier the studies of three dimensional percolation processes, and phase transformations in general, and significant contributes to the understanding of physics of disordered solids. The importance of structural studies can hardly be overestimated. Structure determines the major properties of materials: electrical, <b>elastical,</b> thermo-dynamical etc. However, until now the subject of structural studies of amorphous materials is an area of wide debate and comprehensive picture still has to be built. In this work I have presented the results of a structural study of bulk amorphous solid solutions (GaSb) _ 1 _-_x(Ge_ 2) _x prepared by solid state amorphization under high pressures. The most powerful method for structural investigations of disordered solids has been applied [...] the technique of EXAFS [...] under a variety of conditions: at low temperatures, under high pressures and at ambient conditions. Combined EXAFS and powder diffraction methods have been used to study the high pressure behavior of materials. The results revealed a complex picture of structural transformations in (GaSb) _ 1 _-_x(Ge_ 2) _x owing to the meta-stable nature of samples. The semiconductor-to-metal transition observed previously is found to be due to percolation through the high pressure metallic phase GaSb II. It is showed that the combination of two structural techniques, powder diffraction and EXAFS, can provide quite detailed information on the structural behavior of amorphous materials under high pressures. The temperature-dependent EXAFS studies showed that semiconducting amorphous GaSb is likely to be chemically ordered. Issues concerning determination of the structure of amorphous materials and information theory are widely discussed.

40|$|The {{challenges}} {{addressed in}} the „ACARE Vision 2020 “ refer to the securing of the potential of technological innovation to build safer, greener and smarter aircraft. This is a key function within international competition and needs the support from scientific research establishments on national and European level. One essential goal of ACARE Vision 2020 is the reduction of noise- and exhaust- emissions during air traffic. This reduction can only be achieved by technical improvements, which need an extended knowledge about the basic physical processes e. g. in aircraft engine flows and in the aerodynamics of wings in high-lift-configuration. For the understanding of such flows with intrinsically unsteady behaviour (flow separation, transition, turbulence, vortex development and dynamics) with related flow-structure-interaction and flow induced noise sources and at high Reynolds numbers imaged based measurement methods are an indispensable tool for the determination of fluid dynamical measures in whole fields and on surfaces of (model-) parts in the flow. Nowadays, numerical methods are in a phase of rapid development enabling more and more the prediction of flows {{in the fields of}} unsteady and high Reynolds number aerodynamics by applying adapted turbulence- and transition- models or advanced simulation methods (Hybrid RANS-LES / DES). For being accepted as reliable tools for the design process of innovative aircraft concepts, which requires a coupling of these CFD codes with CSM and CAA methods for an integrated approach, extensive validation experiments by using image based measurement methods are necessary, because only they can deliver the needed spatially high resolved (unsteady) data in fields and volumes. Uniquely in the world various and complementary non-intrusive and image based measurement techniques (PSP, TSP, IR, PIV, BOS, IPCT, Acoustic- Array) for mobile use in wind tunnels and free flight experiments have been developed in the institutes of AS and AT. Common practice was the selective application of these measurement techniques for the characterisation of flow conditions around wind tunnel models or their acoustical respectively <b>elastical</b> effects. The combined application of optical and acoustical measurement techniques enables the quantification of different fluid mechanically, aero-acoustically and –elastically relevant measurement categories like pressure, velocity vectors, density, model deformation and noise sources in fields, on surfaces or even in whole volumes successively and parallel for a given wind tunnel model. By this as much as possible unsteady field data can be achieved, which cannot be determined otherwise. Such measurement data are of high importance for the development, validation and combination of complex simulation tools, like CFD (URANS, DES, LES, DNS), CSM or CAA. Furthermore, the combined application of these measurement techniques enables (partly for the first time) the investigation of physical interrelations (e. g. the noise source mechanisms of unsteady flows or the elastic effects of (dynamical) forces and moments on model parts.). For two central experimental fields of aerodynamic investigations: the high-lift-configuration wing, represented by the F 16 - and the “community friendly aircraft (BNF) ” –model, and the jet engine flow, represented by the UHBR and the ATRA-V 2527 engine at ground-test conditions, combined image-based experimental measurement systems have been applied within SAMURAI in order to achieve a large field- dataset for the extension of the aero-dynamic, - elastic and -acoustic knowledge of these two complex flow regimes. Additionally, the validation of and comparison with accompanying advanced numerical simulations have been performed in the frame of SAMURAI for the BNF- and V 2517 engine flows...|$|E
40|$|Since Multi Body System (MBS) codes {{have been}} {{proved to be}} {{potentially}} powerful simulation tools in {{the whole range of}} helicopter rotor dynamics, here the question of modelling the free flying helicopter in a pure MBS as well as in a hybrid FEMBS dynamical simulation model is highlighted. The objective of this research work are modelling techniques for decribing the dynamical behaviour and the struchtural interaction between helicopter rotors - main and tail rotor - and the nacelle of a free flying helicopter. Here the focus lies on the coupling of the rotating structure of the fully elastic main rotor with the non-rotating parts of the body structure via a flexible rotor-nacelle interface. As simulation platform the 9 [to] generic model "Helicopter H 9 " has been developed. Representing the research object for this investigation it serves as a demonstrator model and as dynamic reference configuration for both the MBS and the FEM calculations. The "Helicopter H 9 " has a five blade main rotor with a diameter of D= 16 [m], a four blade tail rotor with a diameter of D= 2. 8 [m] and a MTOW of 9118. 4 [to]. Investigated are modelling techniques for simulating the dynamics of the structural behaviour of the free flying helicopter in the frequency domain. On the MBS side the commecial tool SIMPACK is tested while on the FEM side the scientific rotor code GYRBLAD is used. For reasons of a better clarification of the rotor-cell coupling effects the center of gravity of the helicopter fuselage exhibits large offsets in all three coordinate directions. As a consequence we get a highly non-symmetrical dynamical system w. r. t the main rotor axis and a rotated principal axes system. By the fact that the main rotor axis does not coincide with any of the three inertial axes all three rigid body rotational modes will be coupled by the main rotor gyroscopic effect. Concerning the specific dynamic coupling effects between rotor and nacelle a survey study with topics like the main rotor suspension (lateral and vertical) or the elasticity of the drive train had been conducted. In systematic variation of the respective stiffness values (over four decades) the results of different parameter studies are presented as numerical results for single constant rotor speeds as well as in frequency fan diagrams for the overall dynamical behaviour under the change of rotor speed. By applying different blade pitch angles the influence of the blade pitch positon on the rotor eigenbehaviour has being tested. By introducing different kinematical and dynamical boundary conditions, cases of stability loss due to ground resonance could be reproduced for the isolated rotor. Even cases of stability loss of the free flying helicopter concerning <b>elastical</b> eigenmodes of the coupeled rotor-nacelle-system - an air resonance type - could be detected in this work. The validation of the models finally was done by comparing the eigenmodes and the eigenvalue results produced with the two elasto-mechanical methods MBS and FEM. Thus different algorithms and independent tools have been used in the examination. It has been shown that for the non-rotating {{as well as for the}} rotating test cases the coupling effects will be reproduced without any restriction in both approaches. Thus the potential of a sophisticated MBS code like SIMPACK as a powerful simulation tool for helicopter dynamics has been demonstrated with respect to the dynamics of the free flying helicopter. ...|$|E
40|$|Adhesive organs enable insects to {{reversibly}} {{adhere to}} substrates even during rapid locomotion. In this process {{a very fast}} but reliable change of adhesion and detachment is realised. These abilities had aroused high interest by scientists many years ago, trying to create artificial reusable adhesion devices. Within the frame of this thesis the detailed structures and the functionalites of the adhesive organs of the stick insect Carausius morosus were analysed {{and based on the}} obtained data artificial adhesion devices were constructed and finally validated. Initially, the morphology and the ultrastructure of the adhesive organs was analysed using SEM, TEM, CLSM, micro-CT, FIB and light microscopy. By these analyses the detailed ultrastructure of the smooth adhesive organs of stick insects, the so called arolia, and of the hairy adhesive organs, the so called euplantulae, could be revealed. Especially, new insights into the structure of the treelike branching fibres within the procuticula were obtained, which support the thin membranous epicuticula by which arolia are covered. Presumably, this very thin epicuticula can conform to the smallest surface roughnesses and the treelike branching fibres support the epicuticula without preventing its flexibility. Due to this design smooth adhesive organs most likely can conform to substrates so close, that adhesion forces on the basis of van der Waals forces were developed. Several further issues concerning the adhesion of stick insects were analysed {{in the course of this}} thesis. Among others the development of a new method for the determination of the Young´s modulus of thin and superficial membranes enabled to determine the Young´s modulus of the epicuticula. In this method arolia of stick insects adhering upside down to a latex membrane were stretched by stretching the latex membrane. Meanwhile, the elongation of the contact area between the arolium and the latex membrane was recorded. The observed elongations were analysed using finite element simulations yielding Young´s moduli of about 60 MPa. This value is much higher than the values determined or assumed for the epicuticula of adhesive organs before. Based on all results four construction plans for the fabrication of artificial adhesion devices were developed. All construction plans contained an outer, thin, flexible and adhesive membrane out of a silicone, which was supported by different resilient substructures. In the first adhesion device the substructure consisted of a silicone foam and in the second adhesion device the substructure was formed by an array of parallel fibres, orientated at an angle of 57 deg. The third adhesion device included thin flock fibres, which were orientated about perpendicularly to the adhesive surface of the adhesion device and which were infused with a very <b>elastical</b> silicone gel. In the fourth adhesion device the substructure was solely made out of the same elastic silicone gel, which found a use in the third adhesion device. During the course of this thesis the constructional ideas how to fabricate artificial adhesion devices were submitted to the Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt. Among the four adhesion devices the one with flock fibres showed the highest adhesion force of about 1. 25 N/sq cm, which is a bit higher than the adhesion force of stick insects without the contribution of friction. This high adhesion force seems to be based on the reinforcement of the adhesion device with fibres, by which pulling forces are uniformly transferred to the contact area of the adhesion device to the substrate. A non-uniform loading of the contact area easily leads to a local detachment at the area of the highest loading, which could lead to a gradual detachment of the whole adhesion device. Such a gradual detachment goes along with small adhesion forces. Taking into account all results, a new construction plan for the fabrication of artificial adhesion devices was developed. According to this plan adhesion devices should be covered with a preferably thin membrane with a high Young´s modulus. This membrane should be supported by a substructure made of a resilient and elastic foam or gel. Besides, the substructure should be reinforced by very thin fibres, which equip the adhesion devices with a high tensile strength without reducing the resiliency of the substructure. Biomimetic adhesion devices fabricated according to this construction plan should show high adhesion forces as well as high resistances against abrasion and contamination...|$|E

Günümüzde, levhalar üzerinde seçilen koordinatların deformasyon ölçümleri yapılabilmektedir. Bu tür ölçümler vasıtasıyla ilgili kabuk içerisinde birikmesi öngörülen gerilme değerleri ve belirlenen bu gerilme değerleri altında litosferin elastik özelliklerine bağlı olarak nasıl bir davranış sergileyeceğini tespit etmek mümkündür. Böylece plakaların hareketinden yola çıkarak plaka içerisinde birikmesi öngörülen basınç değerlerinin doğru bir şekilde yapılabilmesi için, GPS ölçümlerinin yüksek hassasiyette yapılması gerekmektedir. Benzer araştırmalar tektonik hareketlerin zamana bağlı davranışlarını anlama ve depremlerin meydana gelme olasılığını kestirme açısından hayati önem taşımaktadır.

Bu çalışmada kurulan GPS ağının seyrekliği, kullanılan dataların kesikli ve kısa bir dönemi kapsaması bir dezavantaj gibi görülmesine rağmen daha yoğun GPS ağları ve daha zengin ve sürekli istasyon verileri kullanarak çok daha doğru sonuçlara gidilebileceği anlaşılmıştır. Turkey tectonically {{is part of}} {{the famous}} Alpine belt that extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the Himalaya Mountains. There are many large and small faults endowed with {{different}} mechanisms {{as a result of the}} collision of Arabian and African plate with Eurasian Plate. North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) is one of the most active region where very destructive earthquakes took place in the past, situated from Karlıova to Mudurnu. As a consequence of those tectonic movements East Anatolian Fault Zone (EAFZ) generate many important earthquakes as well, starting from Antakya - Amik Basin to Karlıova junction. In addition to this situation, Eagen Graben System is very known active area in terms of earthquake occuring in the East Mediterranean Sea. Regarding these three very important earthquake zone, it can be said that Turkey is at risk in the sense of destructive earthquakes occuring obviously In the last century, Turkey was land owner of several catastrophic earthquakes like 1939 Great Erzincan Earthquake (M= 7. 9), 1943 Tosya Ladik Earthquake (M= 7. 2), 1999 Marmara Earthquake (M= 7. 5) and the last example is 2011 Van Earthquake (7. 2). Earthquakes which come with loss of life and property affect negatively to the countries in terms of materiality and spirituality. Due to that reason, prediction of some parameters like the time of the occuring, magnitude and location of earthquakes are investigated by many scientists from different disciplines. In the earthquake prediction researches there is not only deterministic approaches but also there are many stochastic approximations. For that purpose, great numbers of parameters are investigated just like, alteration of magnetic field and electrical field, flactuations of radon gas, changes of water level and temperature for water wells and anomaly behaviour of animals. Earthquake source parameters, fault slip length, hypocentral depth, spreading of the stress fields and reaction with other faults provides improved estimations of earthquake risk analyses. Reliably presenting of earthquake threat is enabled by constucting monitoring local, regional, national networks. Before, after and at the time of the earthquake, description of the physical and chemical changes that occured as a result of crustal deformation contribute to definition of active faults, reaction of the faults with eachothers, earthquake prediction research. With the new scientific approaches, scientists tried to protect from natural disasters by determining them more accurately. It is a major step that human beings enabled monitoring the planet from space by means of satellite technology. Technological improvements not only provide making more precise analysis about understanding of planet but also come with new approximation methods that should be interdisciplinary. In this manner, studies of earthquakes, fault mechanism, earthquake parameter determination and earthquake effects on surface and undergound are leaded by geology, geophysics, geodesy, civil and mining engineers. Firstly, GPS is used by USA-Ministery of Defence for military aims like finding directions, military attacts and rockets firings. After its permission for civil usage, it has got several application field such as geodesy, geophysics, archeology and mining. The Global Positioning System has been the most applicable to understand crustal movements, fault behaviours, periodicity of the earthqukaes. GPS consist of satellites spin around orbit continously and receiver-controler system situated definite position on plates. The satellites porpagate radio signals to receivers and GPS receivers enables positionings of stations. GPS technology is widely use by geodesy and photogrammetry for positionings borders, structures and map theme. By taking data from a GPS device repeatedly, movement along the faults and subduction zones between plates can be determined. Earthquakes can be describe as a complex elastik wave propagation due to relaxion of accumulated energy (flexibal deformation) in the faults. After the earthquakes, two type deformation emerge, static and dynamics deformation. Static deformation is a permanent (plastic) deformation depending on offset quantity and mechanism of the fault. Dynamic deformation propagates by <b>elastical</b> waves during and after fracturing of the fault and it cause to pressure, rotation and distortion. Reid, source of inspiration in this monitoring technology, is first person leaded to study about earthquake mechanism solution and crust deformation by geodetic measurements on San Francisco Earhquake back in 1906. Elastic rebound theory is an clarification for how energy is spread during earthquakes. According to Reid s theory, the geodetic network and triangulation station is being deformed when it is subject to any seismic forces, and faults behaviours can be modelled with the help of this theory. Determination studies of crustal deformation are conducted by many scientists work in different disciplines. Nowadays, deformation measurements of specific coordinate which take place on the plates is available. By the help of these measurements, expected stress value that accumulated in crustal and under these stress values ascertainment of litosphere s behaviour that depends on its <b>elastical</b> properties is available. In order to do these calculation correctly GPS measurements have to have high presicion. These researches have vital importance from the view point of understanding time dependent tectonic movements and prediction of occurrence probability. The biggest disadvantage of GPS technology is being dependant to USA decision as seen 2003 Iraq War. Due to these manipulations, GPS stations don t have continous data. These kind of shortages removed by linearization. Regarding the area to be considered, the measurements which are to determine the changes in structure of crustal that occurred in specific time should be continual. Only when this applied, the fault behaviours can be defined by means of the measurements that are taken before the eartquake, at the time of earthquake and after the earthquake. Three different data sets are worked by using the continous and year average of GPS data sets for different regions in the extent of this study. Referring to the results of the study areas, the principal stress maps are obtained by making use of contouring methods with using different themes. All of this application is executed in MATLAB. Anayzing, visualization and mapping application for all of the study areas are composed of some hierarchy coding in MATLAB. Firsly, latitude and longitude values of stations are executed for the interested study area. After that, lateral displacement component of the stations are executed to the MATLAB Workspace as inputs. And then coordinat values of coastal lines for the interested study area are entered to the MATLAB. After that input execution, decisive parameters like unit deformation velocity tensor, stress velocity tensor, principal velocity values and rotations of this values are obtained by doing some linear assumption. Seven GPS stations which have continous measurements and a GPS network are created for the region of the first study area and its surroundings. To determine the effect of 17 August 1999 Gölcük Earthquake on GPS network, GPS measurements that cover approximately 10 yers time period between 7 May 1998 and 27 July 2008 are analyzed. To determine whether there is any relationship between changes in GPS datas and earthquakes or not, 1356 earthquake record is defined that covered the study area between 7 May 1998 and 1 January 2006. Earthquake data sets are obtained from Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institution. Taking into consideration of finite element network for the first study area, for the most affected element by 17 August 1999 Gölcük Earthquake, displacement and stress alterations are compared with definite earthquake records. According to the comparisons, after the 17 August Gölcük Earthquake, there is a strict harmony between seismicity of the area and strain velocity and unit deformation velocity. In so far as roughness of the GPS network and because of linear behaviour assumption of the crust, creep behaviour that should be observed in especially Ismetpasa segment of the North Anatolian Fault can t be obtained. When principal stress maps are investigated for the first study area, stress values are compatible with tectonics of the areas. Most affected element of the network takes place in Aegean region, hence this region is one of the most famous area in terms of earthquake activity. Principal stress maps refer that there is not only a decreasing of the stress values but also shows that there is a counter clockwise rotation of the stress values. For second study area which take place on Turkey and surrounding, by considering yearly avarage GPS measurements between 1988 and 1997 which involde 32 GPS station and 51 element, more detailed than first study network is designed. The measurements cover all area from Cucasus Mountains to Adriatic Sea and from north of the African plate to south margin of the Europian plate. After analyzing of the second study area, when distribution of the principal stress values are investigated, regions that contain the highest stress values like Erzincan and surrounding area, Eagen costlines and Saros Gulf are at the same time most active regions in terms of sesimic activity. Also, there is a obvious lineament between the distribution of the shearing stress values and North Anatolian Fault. This Lineaments proofs right lateral strike baheviour for the NAFZ. As it is well known, after Marmara and Düzce Earthquake,Marmara region is a center of attention for many scientists who are from different disciplines. Especially, there are many studies for the Marmara region about determination of the faults mechanism and periodicity for taking some precaution to be protected from destructive effects of earthquakes. In the third study area, the most appropriate GPS network is constructed and using the finite element method proposed by Aydan (2000), the variation of the quantity and the direction for the principal stress distribution is executed in Marmara Sea and the vicinity of it. The last study area GPS network that cover Marmara Sea and nearby is created with using 28 GPS station and 43 element. According to maps show distribution the principal stress values, the most notable areas in terms of high shearing stress are compatible with clustering of epicentres. The results obtained are compared with Turkey’s plate tectonic and they are consistent with each other. In conclusion, as a part of our daily life GPS which is a system of remote sensing and measurement is very effective and open-to-improvement instrument for defining earth dynamics. With the widespread usage of GPS scientif researchers would be able to understand nature easily. Although in this study, analyzied data and density of the networks for all case studies were rough, by using more dense network and more continous GPS time series, better result could be obtained.
