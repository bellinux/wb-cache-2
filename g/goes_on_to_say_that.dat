5|$|The book {{begins by}} looking at religion, {{specifically}} God as non-being and as being, put by Stace as the negative and positive divine. Stace then defines two orders of being - time and eternity, which he says intersect {{in the moment of}} mystic illumination. He <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the nature of God or eternity is such that all religious language is symbolic and that it is necessarily subject to contradictions.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} to the ritual is not explicit in the oldest Upanishads. On occasions, the Upanishads extend {{the task of the}} Aranyakas by making the ritual allegorical and giving it a philosophical meaning. For example, the Brihadaranyaka interprets the practice of horse-sacrifice or ashvamedha allegorically. It states that the over-lordship of the earth may be acquired by sacrificing a horse. It then <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> spiritual autonomy can only be achieved by renouncing the universe which is conceived in the image of a horse.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, Pakistani {{media reports}} {{suggested}} that export orders {{have also been}} confirmed and signed with the Sri Lanka Air Force, according to Pakistan-based 92 News while some other sources claim that Myanmar is the first buyer of Pakistani JF-17 Thunder jets. The article <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> deliveries are likely to begin in 2017. According to the report, the order will be for around 18–24 aircraft, potentially confirming claims made at the 51st Paris Air Show that the first contract {{for the sale of}} the JF-17 had been signed with the Sri Lanka Air Force.|$|E

5|$|Isabeau was {{dismissed}} by historians as a wanton, weak and indecisive leader. Modern historians now {{see her as}} taking an unusually active leadership role for a queen of her period, forced to take responsibility {{as a direct result}} of Charles' illness. Her critics accepted skewed interpretations of her role in the negotiations with England, resulting in the Treaty of Troyes, and in the rumors of her marital infidelity with Orléans. Gibbons writes that a queen's duty was to secure the succession to the crown and look after her husband; historians described Isabeau as having failed in both respects, and she came to be seen as one of the great villains of history. Gibbons <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> even her physical appearance is uncertain; depictions of her vary depending on whether she was to be portrayed as good or evil.|$|E

25|$|Explaining how sacraments are means or instruments, not ends in themselves, Francis says: He <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> true disciples {{encounter}} the Lord in the sacraments and receive {{the power to}} follow Jesus' teaching. One cannot cover up injustice, dishonesty, and uncharitableness against one's neighbor with prayers and devotions.|$|E
25|$|Lucio Russo {{has said}} that Plutarch, in his work On the Face in the Moon, was {{reporting}} some physical theories that we consider to be Newtonian and that these may have come originally from Hipparchus; he <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Newton may {{have been influenced by}} them. According to one book review, both of these claims have been rejected by other scholars.|$|E

25|$|Maimonides, one of Judaism's most {{important}} theologians and legal experts, explained in detail why Jesus {{was wrong to}} create Christianity and why Muhammad was wrong to create Islam; he laments the pains Jews have suffered in persecution from followers of these new faiths as they attempted to supplant Judaism (in the case of Christianity, called Supersessionism). However, Maimonides then <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> both faiths {{can be considered a}} positive part of God's plan to redeem the world.|$|E
25|$|Jordanes {{admits that}} he did not then have direct access to Cassiodorus's book, and could not {{remember}} the exact words, but that he felt confident that he had retained the substance in its entirety. He <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he added relevant passages from Latin and Greek sources, composed the Introduction and Conclusion, and inserted various things of his own authorship. Due to this mixed origin, the text has been examined in an attempt to sort out the sources for the information it presents.|$|E
25|$|Dawkins {{interviews}} Haggard {{and begins}} by likening the worship experience to a Nuremberg Rally of which Goebbels {{might have been}} proud. Haggard says he knows nothing of the Nuremberg Rallies and <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> some evangelicals think of his services as something akin to rock concerts. Haggard said the Bible is true and doesn't contradict itself as science does. Dawkins contends that the advantage of science is that new evidence changes ideas, allowing the advancement of human knowledge, something religion does not allow. Steadily the exchanges become increasingly fractious.|$|E

The review <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> changes to the Kindle 2 have made it tougher to read the smaller font sizes that most books use. Some writers discuss how the font size is at times worse than that of the first generation Kindle. It appears that whether the Kindle 2 is clearer or fuzzier than the prior model depends on the font size.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} {{evidence for}} Thucydides's life comes from rather less reliable later ancient sources. According to Pausanias, someone named Oenobius {{was able to}} get a law passed allowing Thucydides to return to Athens, presumably sometime shortly after the city's surrender {{and the end of the}} war in 404 BC. Pausanias <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Thucydides was murdered on his way back to Athens. Many doubt this account, seeing evidence to suggest he lived as late as 397 BC. Plutarch claims that his remains were returned to Athens and placed in Cimon's family vault.|$|E
25|$|As well {{as these}} mostly local races, Thought, ridden by Green, {{started to take}} to a wider stage. At the Waltham Abbey Steeple Chase on 9 April 1840 he came second to Jerry, the 1840 Grand National winner, ridden by Jem Mason in a duel that was a credit to both riders, even if the race itself was mismanaged. After this {{promising}} start to his career, though, the potted biography of 1850 <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Christopher Green's farming interests took precedence over his racing and he gave up professional horsemanship. He only 'took to the pigskin again' in 1849.|$|E

25|$|According to The Clan Ranald Bard, on 3 April 1746, the Royal Navy ship Baltimore arrived, {{and demanded}} (under threat of force) {{to be given}} the meat from the best cattle on the Island; 4 days later, {{complaining}} that the meat was rotten, the sailors threw it away, and slaughtered 60 cattle themselves. The Bard <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> 12 days later, the Royal Navy ship Commodore arrived, and after receiving warning (from one of the sailors) about the lecherous intentions of the sailors, the women of Canna fled into the countryside and caves, until they were certain that the ship had departed; one pregnant woman miscarried from spending so long in the cold, and died.|$|E
25|$|Ideal Motherhood (T. Y. Crowell & Co., New York and Boston) was {{reviewed}} by The Arena who stated, to read Ideal Motherhood means an upliftment of soul, a keener appreciation of woman's highest privilege. While presenting an ideal, the author does not carry it {{beyond the pale}} of the practical; she believes in the necessity of combining the masculine and feminine elements, the developed intellect and intuition, as commensurate factors in shaping the young life. The review in The School Journal <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> Davis makes some very practical suggestions regarding motherhood, the responsibility entailed thereby, and the necessity for careful and thoughtful preparation for the duties encumbent upon parents.|$|E
25|$|After the {{political}} upheavals in Tibet in the 1950s, Pallis became {{active in the}} affairs of the Tibetan Society, the first Western support group created for the Tibetan people. Pallis also was able to house members of the Tibetan diaspora in his London flat. Pallis also formed a relationship with the young Chögyam Trungpa, who had just arrived in England. Trungpa asked Pallis to write the foreword to Trungpa’s first, autobiographical book, Born in Tibet. In his acknowledgment, Trungpa offers Pallis his “grateful thanks” for the “great help” that Pallis provided in bringing the book to completion. He <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> “Mr. Pallis when consenting to write the foreword, devoted many weeks to the work of finally putting the book in order”.|$|E
