5|$|The {{nineteenth century}} saw some major {{engineering}} projects including Thomas Telford's (1757–1834) stone Dean Bridge (1829–31) and iron Craigellachie Bridge (1812–14). In the 1850s {{the possibilities of}} new wrought- and cast-iron construction were explored {{in the building of}} commercial warehouses in Glasgow. This adopted a round-arched Venetian style first used by Alexander Kirkland (1824–92) at the heavily ornamented 37–51 Miller Street (1854) and translated into iron in John Baird I's Gardner's Warehouse (1855–6), with an exposed <b>iron</b> <b>frame</b> and almost uninterrupted glazing. Most industrial buildings avoided this cast-iron aesthetic, like William Spence's (1806?–83) Elgin Engine Works built in 1856-8, using massive rubble blocks.|$|E
5|$|There is a ring {{of eight}} bells hung in an <b>iron</b> <b>frame</b> in the tower; they are rung from {{the ground floor of}} the tower. Five of the bells were cast in 1741 by Abel Rudhall of Gloucester. They were rehung in 1908. The sixth bell was recast in 1865 by Mears and Co. of London. In 1919, the church bells were still customarily rung to signal the town curfew between September and March. Two more bells were added in 1937, cast by Mears and Stainbank.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 2009–10 season Bogosian was {{bothered by}} an injury. During {{a game against}} the Ottawa Senators on October 31, 2009, Bogosian fell behind his team's net; with his left hand lying on the net's <b>iron</b> <b>frame</b> along the ice, another player fell on top of him. The impact broke his left thumb and injured his wrist. Though he did not miss any time from the injury, it had an effect on his {{offensive}} play; Bogosian was perceived to be more hesitant with the puck, choosing to pass it more often than shooting. In the first 17 games of the season, he had scored 8 goals, then went 29 contests without scoring. In the final 64 games, he only scored 2 goals. After he recovered, Bogosian admitted he did not play at his full capacity, but had decided not to disclose the injury to the team until the season finished in April 2010. Regardless of his injury, Bogosian only missed one game throughout the season, a game on March 14 against the Phoenix Coyotes. Even with these setbacks, Bogosian set career highs for games played (81), goals (10), assists (13) and points (23). The 10 goals he scored tied a team record for most by a defenseman in a season, first set by Yannick Tremblay in 1999–2000, the Thrashers' inaugural year. He also set a team record with 196 hits. Again the Thrashers missed the playoffs.|$|E

25|$|The WC {{was popular}} in the Great Depression for its good value, {{affordable}} price, and frugal design elements. Two factors that lowered its cost of manufacture, and thus its sales price, were that it was made partially from off-the-shelf components, and that its steel channel <b>iron</b> <b>frame</b> eliminated the need for large, heavy castings for the transmission and rear end (as were often used in tractors of the era). Its power was ample for the time and class, allowing it to pull a two-bottom plow.|$|E
25|$|From the 17th Century until 1878 {{there were}} six bells, which came from the Salisbury foundry. In 1878 two {{additional}} trebles were cast by John Warner & Sons. One of them was very thin and eventually needed to be repaired. In 1923 the peal was recast by Gillett & Johnston and hung in a new <b>iron</b> <b>frame</b> replacing the solid oak one. Finally in 1947 two further bells were cast by John Taylor & Co from the bell metal salvaged from the ruins of Holyrood Church.

40|$|To {{assess the}} fire {{resistance}} of historical buildings, information is needed about the applied materials, the construction details, etc. Starting from this information calculation models {{can be set}} up to determine the fire resistance of the total structure and its components. Assessing cast <b>iron</b> <b>framed</b> buildings is difficult because cast iron as well as the former construction techniques are no longer used. Nevertheless the contemporary Eurocodes (EC) can be helpful when renovating such buildings.

Two calculations illustrate how the EC can be applied to evaluate the fire resistance of the structure. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
25|$|The Great Globe was not {{the first}} project of its kind: a small hollow globe was {{completed}} in 1664 for Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, and the Georama built by C. F. P. Delanglard in Paris in the 1820s had been on similar lines to Wyld's project– a large globe with the earth represented on the interior surface and a pair of spiral staircases from which visitors could view the attraction. The Georama had been smaller and of a simpler construction though, using material and paper draped over an <b>iron</b> <b>frame,</b> and the methods employed there would not have been applicable to Wyld's larger, more robust version.|$|E
25|$|In 1768, {{the missionaries}} were jailed {{for three months}} when Siamese {{authorities}} complained to the local ruler Mạc Thiên Tứ that the school had afforded shelter to a fugitive Siamese prince. Pigneau was put into a cangue, a wooden and <b>iron</b> <b>frame</b> fastened around his limbs weighing eight pounds. He ignored family requests to return to France, saying that his missionary work {{was more important than}} a comfortable life. In 1769, the school was attacked by Chinese and Cambodian pirates, who massacred some of the students and burnt down the establishment... Pigneau was forced to flee in December 1769 with the survivors to Pondicherry, then a French territory, after a long sea journey through Malacca. The College was established a few miles from Pondicherry, in Virampatnam.|$|E
25|$|Like their predecessors, the Wolfstür (Wolf's door) of the Aachen Cathedral and the Marktportal (Market Portal) of the Mainz Cathedral, the Bernward Doors were {{manufactured}} {{using the}} Lost-wax process, which puts exceptional {{demands on the}} workers of the casting workshop, since the mold can only be used once. The individual scenes of the doors were carved from massive wax or tallow tablets by modellers and then combined, supported by an <b>iron</b> <b>frame,</b> which is probably how the slight irregularities in the bands which divide the individual scenes came about. Even the doorknockers {{in the form of}} grotesque lion's heads with rings of grace in their mouths were included in the original mold rather than being soldered on later. Technical analysis has shown that the mold was stood on the long side and filled with bronze, so that the molten metal would spread evenly; investigation has found cooling cracks in the metal. The result of this process was probably still rather rough, covered in metal bumps from the pipes in the mold through which the metal was poured in and through which air escaped and it would have had to have been worked over and polished up in great detail.|$|E

500|$|According to the Smithsonian, Roper's first {{velocipede}} of 1867–1869 used {{a purpose}} built frame rather than adapting an existing velocipede frame by retrofitting a steam engine, but one contemporary newspaper account does assert that Roper repurposed a velocipede frame, and Setright and motoring author Roland Brown say Roper used a hickory wood frame {{built by the}} Hanlon Brothers, who made and demonstrated boneshakers at fairs and circuses, although the Smithsonian's Roper has an <b>iron</b> <b>frame.</b> It had a wheelbase of [...] and two [...] diameter wheels made of iron bands on wooden s with wooden spokes. It had a rigid, forged iron fork, and a solid handlebar with wooden grips. Unlike the modern twistgrip, where the grip on only one side is a sleeve that rotates around the handlebar to open the throttle, the Roper velocipede's entire bar was rotated with both hands, {{and it had a}} dual function. When turned forward, the throttle opened, and when turned backwards it applied the spoon brake on the front wheel. The seat doubled as the water reservoir; or the water tank can be described as saddle shaped. A hand pump transferred water from this tank to the boiler. The boiler was between the wheels with a [...] "nautical looking" [...] chimney from the boiler angling backwards behind the rider, with the firebox in the lower half of this housing, all of which hung from the frame with a spring to absorb shock, while two stay rods attached the bottom of the housing {{to the back of the}} frame. There were three water level cocks on the left side, near the water pump, and a drain valve on the bottom. The two cylinders, with bores of about [...] were located on either side of the frame, from the upper part of the boiler near the chimney, connecting to [...] cranks on the rear wheel. Exhaust steam, conveyed by tubing to the base of the chimney, provided a forced draft.|$|E
