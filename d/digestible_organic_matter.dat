The concentrations of cyanide, <b>digestible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> crude protein and net energy for lactation were measured at different harvests throughout the growing season. The average cyanide concentrations differed {{significantly in the}} years and the seasons within the year; however, the concentrations were not affected by CO 2. <b>Digestible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> crude protein and net energy for lactation differed significantly with the seasons {{of the year and}} cutting frequencies. While <b>digestible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and net energy for lactation were not affected by elevated pCO 2, the concentration of crude protein decreased from 288 g kg - 1 at ambient to 251 g kg -l at elevated pCO 2. Since the crude protein concentration in herbage from Trifolium monocultures was very high even at elevated CO 2, it is suggested that this decrease in crude protein concentration does not negatively affect forage quality. We conclude that, in Trifolium herbage, the seasons of the year and management practices are more decisive for forage quality than changes in pCO 2. We shall discuss how forage quality and cyanide intake by ruminants may, however, be affected by CO 2 -induced shifts in the proportion of species in mixed plant communities...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: An optimal {{valorization}} {{of plant}} biomasses to produce biofuels requires a good {{knowledge of the}} available contents and molecular composition of the main chemical components, which changes with the harvesting date. Therefore, we assessed the influence of harvesting date on the chemical characteristics of various energy crops {{in the context of}} their conversion to biofuels. RESULTS: We showed that the biomass chemical composition, enzymatic <b>digestible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> bioethanol and thermal energy production potential for each species are impacted by the harvesting date. The proportion of enzymatically <b>digestible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> decreases as the harvesting date is delayed. This is related to the increase in cellulose and lignin contents. The suitability of the biomasses for bioethanol production increases with harvest stage, as the total carbohydrates content increases. The suitability of the biomasses as a source of thermal energy increases according to the harvesting date as the proportion of organic matter increases and the content of mineral compounds decreases. For all investigated energy conversions, the best harvesting period is autumn, because the significantly higher crop dry matter yield largely compensates for the sometimes slightly less favorable chemical characteristics. CONCLUSION: While the biomass composition of energy crops changes with harvest stage, the dry biomass yield per unit area is the main factor that controls the total amount of chemical components, <b>digestible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> bioethanol and thermal energy that can be expected to be harvested per unit area. The biomass compositions presented in this paper are essential to investigate their suitability for bioenergy conversion. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E

Intake was reduced due to underfeeding by approximately 45 % In comparison to cows on the ad libitum feeding level, underfed cows showed reductions in milk, milkfat and milk protein yields, milk protein concentration, long chain fatty acid concentration in the milkfat and liveweight gain. Milkfat concentration, short chain fatty acid concentration in the milkfat and loss in body condition were increased. Following the return of all cows to a generous feeding level, previously underfed cows produced lower daily yields of milk, milkfat and milk protein for three to five weeks and gained more liveweight and condition over mid-lactation. The residual effect of underfeeding on milkfat production was 1. 0 times the immediate effect. There appeared to be no effects of previous underfeeding on milk composition, concentrations of short chain or long chain fatty acids in the milkfat or <b>digestible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> intake. Cow breeding index interacted with the effects of underfeeding in that high versus low breeding index cows showed (a) a smaller residual effect of underfeeding on milkfat production (0. 8 versus 2. 0 times the immediate effects, respectively) and (b) a greater immediate reduction in milk protein concentration due to underfeeding...|$|E
40|$|Total of 477 {{grass silage}} samples of {{different}} origin and quality were analysed by NIR spectroscopy to determine crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), <b>digestible</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (OM) {{in the dry}} matter (DM) (D-value), metabolizable energy (ME), pH value and the ammonium nitrogen (NH 3 -N). According to DM content (g kg- 1 fresh sample), the samples were divided into 8 classes: (1) > 228; (2) 229 - 313; (3) 314 - 398; (4) 399 - 483; (5) 484 - 568; (6) 569 - 653; (7 i) 654 - 738; (8) 0. 005) in NDF and pH value. It was concluded that increased DM concentration in silage samples was not a result of –grass wilting before ensiling but of advanced grass maturity at harvest...|$|E
40|$|Thermophilic {{composting}} of {{pig manure}} was studied {{in an attempt}} to elaborate upon <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> transformation during the process and provided parameters for product maturity using chemical method. The following parameters were measured in 11 samples during the 42 days of composting: <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> dissolved <b>organic</b> carbon (DOC), degradable <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and humic <b>matter</b> (HM). <b>Organic</b> <b>matter</b> decreased during composting process constantly; DOC concentration increased to maximum at 10 days and declined thereafter; degradable <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> decreased whole composting, but they increased in start of high-temperature stage; The increasing level of HM at various stages of composting indicate the progression of humification; H/F provide information correlating to conventional chemical parameters (<b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> DOC) of compost maturity.

50|$|Clay {{minerals}} {{can enhance}} the preservation of <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> and different clay minerals leave distinct signatures. <b>Organic</b> <b>matter</b> accompanied by clays tends to be rich in lipids and deficient in protein and lignin; kaolinite seems to enrich <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> with polysaccharides, whereas <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> rich in aromatic compounds preserve in association with smectites such as montmorillonite.|$|R
40|$|Tillage systems play a {{significant}} role in agricultural production throughout Iowa and the Midwest. It has been well documented that increased tillage intensities can reduce soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in the topsoil due to increased microbial activity and carbon (C) oxidation. The potential loss of soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> due to tillage operations is much higher for high <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> soils than low <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> soils. Tillage effects on soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> can be magnified through soil erosion and loss of soil productivity. Soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> is a natural reservoir for nutrients, buffers against soil erosion, and improves the soil environment to sustain soil productivity. Maintaining soil productivity requires an agriculture management system that maintains or improves soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> content. Combining cropping systems and conservation tillage practices, such as no-tillage, strip-tillage, or ridge-tillage, are proven to be very effective in improving soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and soil quality...|$|R
