25|$|Most of {{the rooms}} {{on the first floor}} and many {{of the rooms}} {{on the second floor of}} Boldt Castle are {{furnished}} , but mostly with modern pieces. The basement is mostly unfinished, with a pool, bowling lanes, many compartments, and a long passage to the Power House. Most of the rooms from the second floor to the top floor have been left unfurnished, but there are exhibits in some of these rooms and hallways showing pictures and artifacts of the Thousand Islands region during the era in which the Boldts lived. These rooms are also left unfurnished to give the visitor an opportunity to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> castle looked like before modern improvement. At the edge of the island, a monument stone triumphal arch, originally intended by George Boldt to be the entrance way for boats, has been fully restored. The bridge connecting the two sides would have been raised and lowered as required.|$|E
500|$|Women debtors were {{housed in}} rooms over the tap room. The {{rooms in the}} barracks (the men's rooms) were [...] square and [...] high, with a window, wooden floors and a fireplace. Each housed two or three prisoners, and as the rooms were too small for two beds, prisoners had to share. Apart from the bed, prisoners were {{expected}} to provide their own furniture. The anonymous witness complained in 1833: [...] "170persons have been confined at one time within these walls, making an average of more than four persons in each room—which are not ten feet square!!! I will leave the reader to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> situation of men, thus confined, particularly in the summer months, must be." ...|$|E
500|$|Beatrice's {{life was}} {{overturned}} {{by the death}} of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901. She wrote to the Principal of the University of Glasgow in March, [...] "...you may <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> grief is. I, who had hardly ever been separated from my dear mother, can hardly realise what life will be like without her, who was the centre of everything." [...] Beatrice's public appearances continued, but her position at court was diminished. She, unlike her sister Louise, was not close to her brother, now King Edward VII, and {{was not included in the}} King's inner circle. Although their relationship did not break down completely, it was occasionally strained, for example when she accidentally (but noisily) dropped her service book from the royal gallery onto a table of gold plate during his coronation.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, comedy duo Key & Peele spoofed Gremlins 2 with {{a sketch}} <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> writers' {{room for the}} movie was like.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 a novel {{with the}} title Olympic Affair was {{published}} by Terry Frei in which he depicts the life of Morris. In this book Frei <b>imagines</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> affair with Leni Riefenstahl would be like.|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} batter was Graves, who strode up smiling, confident, sarcastic, {{as if he}} knew {{he could}} do more than <b>the</b> others. Ken <b>imagined</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> third-baseman would have said if the coach had not been present. Graves always ruffled Ken the wrong way.|$|R
500|$|During the game's planning, it {{was decided}} that it should not be {{directly}} connected to Shin Megami Tensei, ensuring that it would hold interest independent from the first game; because of this, Kaneko envisioned it as a story loosely based on Shin Megami Tenseis future. At first, he imagined it to take place ten years after the first game, as he thought that would be roughly the amount of time needed for society to rebuild, but another staff member wanted it to take place hundreds of years later. Kaneko disagreed, saying that culture would have changed a lot over a hundred years, and that he could not even <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> world would look like a hundred years into the future or what it had been like during the Meiji period. The two had different ideas about the timeline of the series, but eventually decided to set the game [...] "several decades" [...] after Shin Megami Tensei. They made use of the tree of life as a central theme of the story.|$|E
500|$|Rising {{standards}} of achievement at Dartington enabled Imogen to organise performances of more demanding works, such as Bach's Mass in B minor in July 1950 to honour the 200th anniversary of Bach's death. Three years in preparation, this endeavour brought a tribute {{from one of}} the audience: [...] "I don't know, and can't <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> music of heaven is like. But when we all get there, please God, if any conducting is still necessary I hope your services will be required and that I will be in the chorus". By the middle of 1950 Imogen's professional focus was changing. She had attended the first two Aldeburgh Festivals in 1948 and [...] 1949, and in 1950 accepted a commission [...] to provide a choral work for performance at the 1951 festival. Sensing {{that it was time to}} leave Dartington, she gave a year's notice, part of which was spent on sabbatical, studying Indian music at Rabindranath Tagore's university in West Bengal. A fruit of this visit was her Ten Indian Folk Tunes for recorder. On 21 July 1951 her one-act opera, Benedick and Beatrice, was performed at Dartington, to mark her departure.|$|E
500|$|Yoko Shimomura {{composed}} {{the music for}} the three main Kingdom Hearts games and their remakes. She began composing video game music in 1988, and joined Square in 1993, but left in 2002 to work freelance. In creating music, Shimomura gathers inspiration from different things outside of her daily routine, like traveling or when she is emotionally moved. She has a respect for solo and orchestral pieces, such as Piano Sonata No. 7 by Ludwig van Beethoven, Ballade No. 1 by Frédéric Chopin, and La Valse by Maurice Ravel. Shimomura was initially hesitant to handle the music for the first Kingdom Hearts; the mix of a Square-style story and Disney characters {{made it hard to}} <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> game would be like, which made it difficult to compose the music. Many of the musical pieces are arrangements of Disney themes, which Shimomura stated she enjoyed arranging. Shimomura felt a great deal of pressure working on such recognizable tunes, and made an effort to maintain the original mood and atmosphere of them while complying with the technical specifications of the PlayStation 2. For example, the original orchestrated arrangement of the song [...] "This is Halloween" [...] from The Nightmare Before Christmas was impossible to reproduce on the PlayStation 2's sound system. To keep aspects of it intact, Shimomura used a trial and error method to arrange the piece.|$|E
50|$|The song is an uptempo, {{in which}} the narrator {{describes}} an average Sunday morning in America. He <b>imagines</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> morning is like for everybody from a mother who takes the Lord’s name in vain while looking for a church parking space, to a homeless man being ignored by the joggers that run by him.|$|R
50|$|It {{can only}} be <b>imagined</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> two former volumes of Pace’s trilogy dealt with. However, if the third extant volume is {{anything}} to go by with, {{they must have been}} enormously interesting from a philosophical point of view. Not only as regards content but surely also as regards intensity, extensiveness and depth. Especially if they dealt with metaphysics and logic.|$|R
50|$|Once again Johan {{goes back}} to {{thinking}} about his past. He is struck by death angst while thinking of his dead parents. Johan also receives a letter from his son who ran away to America many years ago, since Johan wasn't a particularly successful father. The son is asking for money, while Johan is <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> American things mentioned in the letter might look like.|$|R
2500|$|There {{used to be}} six {{characters}} in all? [...] Now there are 10 or more. [...] You can <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> opera has become! The same scenery, appropriate or not, will be used. I haven't been able to bring myself to ask whether it works or not… ...|$|E
2500|$|Jim Parsons' {{portrayal}} of Sheldon has received widespread acclaim, {{and is often}} cited as {{the main reason for}} the program's success by critics and fans alike. James Chamberlin of IGN wrote: [...] "It's hard to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>The</b> Big Bang Theory would be if it weren't for Jim Parsons' great {{portrayal of}} Sheldon Cooper". Matt Roush of TV Guide stated that [...] "there's a spark of divine inspiration in Jim Parsons' uproarious Sheldon Cooper". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote that: [...] "Parsons is doing something rare on network TV: making intellectualism admirable, even heroic".|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} itself {{agreed that the}} private sector contributes about 90 per cent to the nation's Gross Domestic Product. With SMEs forming about 65 per cent of the private sector operations, one can only <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> effects of the new move by the bank will be on the economy." [...] Banks in the country, for along time, {{had been part of the}} problem of the real sector, saying they would rather get involved in round-tripping and short-term lending for commercial activities, than to lend to businesses with manufacturing operations. It is in this light that the new twist is commendable of emulation by other banks. First, through its current GMD, has shown an unusual disposition to the plight of small scale industrialists. I think he deserves all the kudos." ...|$|E
50|$|One {{hundred years}} {{and two days}} ago, Governor Joseph Sayers and Lieutenant Governor James Browning came to the 11-year-old Capitol {{building}} {{during one of the}} coldest winters ever recorded in Texas and took the oath of office. The Texans assembled on that day could not have <b>imagined</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> 20th century would bring or the role Texans would play in the most American of centuries.|$|R
50|$|After {{this article}} was written and {{published}} by InfoWorld, other major media sources such as U.S. News & World Report, Associated Press, CNN, ABC Nightline, and newspapers across the country quickly reported the supposed virus without even {{checking to see if}} the story was true. When the story appeared, it captured the public imagination, with forums everywhere all over <b>the</b> internet <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> virus would look like.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} problems that art directors face is to translate desired moods, messages, concepts, and underdeveloped ideas into imagery. During the brainstorming process, art directors, co-workers, and clients are engaged in <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> finished piece or scene might look like. At times, an art director is ultimately responsible for solidifying the vision of the collective imagination while resolving conflicting agenda and inconsistencies between the various individual inputs.|$|R
2500|$|As a child, Cosmatos frequented a {{video store}} named Video Addict. During these trips he would browse the horror film section {{looking at the}} boxes {{although}} he {{was not allowed to}} watch such films. During such times he would instead <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> film was. He would later reflect upon this experience when making Black Rainbow where one of his goals was [...] "to create a film that is a sort of imagining of an old film that doesn’t exist." [...] The year 1983 was chosen for the story as it's the first year he went to Video Addict. Additionally he thought the idea of setting such a film one year before 1984 was funny. The film's genesis was an overlap between two projects Cosmatos wanted to do. One of these was a film about a girl trapped in an asylum while the other was an installation promoting a research facility that didn't exist. Eventually Cosmatos realized that he could use both ideas in the same project.|$|E

6000|$|... "Miss Panney was at {{our house}} to-day," [...] said the girl, [...] "and I cannot <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> was <b>the</b> matter with her. I never saw anybody {{in such a state}} of mind." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My dear Fenella!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Your guests do not {{understand}} your absence. Mr. Rosario is most annoyed and I cannot <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> is <b>the</b> matter with Starling. I am afraid that he and Rosario have had words." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> things are," [...] she said, [...] "but I suppose I can wait," [...] and {{she went}} into her room and closed her door after her.|$|E

5|$|ILM was {{tasked with}} <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{immediate}} assimilation of an Enterprise crewmember would look like. Jaeger {{came up with}} a set of cables that sprang from the Borg's knuckles and buried themselves in the crewmember's neck. Wormlike tubes would course through the victim's body and mechanical devices break the skin. The entire transformation was created using computer-generated imagery. The wormlike geometry was animated over the actor's face, then blended in {{with the addition of a}} skin texture over the animation. The gradual change in skin tone was simulated with shaders.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Oprah Winfrey, McCarthy said that {{the inspiration for the}} book came during a 2003 visit to El Paso, Texas, with his young son. <b>Imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> city might look like fifty to a hundred years into the future, he pictured [...] "fires on the hill" [...] and thought about his son. He took some initial notes but did not return to the idea until a few years later, while in Ireland. Then, the novel came to him quickly, and he dedicated it to his son, John Francis McCarthy.|$|R
50|$|Sammy Sport travels down to Shoeburyness to {{interview}} the Old Woman who Lives in a Shoe (who has 8 children), and the Policeman enlists the viewers' help in finding Wee Willie Winkie for Crime Spot; it is also evening in Little Juan's town in this episode's El Nombre sketch, and this episode ends with Lolita <b>imagining</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> world {{would be like if}} everything was eight-shaped as she visits the Planet of the Eights to sing an original song about it (and this is the only occasion in this series that she is not seen in her usual purple outfit, but a silver spacesuit).|$|R
60|$|The men {{continued}} to talk, but in such low tones {{that the others}} could only catch a word or two. Something was said about a lion and a chimpanzee and a toolhouse, but the boys could not <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> circus men had in mind to do.|$|E
60|$|You may <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> {{youngest}} brother felt {{on hearing}} these words. Whence {{was he to}} fetch a bride? Would the frog {{be able to help}} him in this new difficulty? With bowed head, and feeling very sad, {{he sat down on the}} edge of the pond.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> captain's up to," [...] he complained.
