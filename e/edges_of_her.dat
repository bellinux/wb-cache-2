500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 6 reviews, and {{scored higher than}} any other album by Clarkson. AllMusic's senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave it a rating of three-and-a-half out of five stars. He described its uptempo arrangements, as well as Clarkson's vocal performance, as [...] "bold and brassy" [...] and its mid-tempo arrangements as [...] "even more alluring". He also noted the track selection [...] "favors the bold," [...] but that [...] "she fares well in this setting, always sounding like the strongest element in the mix". Towards {{the end of his}} review, he wrote: [...] "Perhaps the concept and execution are conventional, but even in this utterly expected setting, Clarkson retains her fiery, individual spirit, and that's what makes Wrapped in Red appealing: to the letter, it delivers what it promises." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also gave it a similar rating. He noted that the album [...] "largely offers a respite from the pop-rock template she's been relentlessly pursuing since Breakaway, with less shouting and more of the varied range and texture on full display that helped coronate her the winner of the inaugural season of American Idol. For better or worse, a decade of recording and touring has roughed up the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> voice, lending a lived-in quality that imbues lyrics about love and longing with an authenticity that might have otherwise been missing had she recorded these songs just a few years earlier." ...|$|E

[...] The women of her family, like her mother, grandmother or other women, would pull out the irregular hairs from the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyebrows to make them fine and beautiful. [...] The edges were rubbed with the girl's saliva and a plant mixture to stop hairs from growing again. [...] After the four days, the same woman would bathe and scrub her.|$|E

60|$|From {{the first}} {{there had been}} a {{different}} feel about the ship, and as the big winds and waves began to strain her she commenced leaking.

We both remained perfectly still. Her hands dropped nervelessly by her side. “I envy you, Monsieur George. If I am to go under I should prefer to be drowned in the sea with the wind on my face. What luck, to feel nothing less than all the world closing over one’s head!” ...|$|E

60|$|He was {{a romantic}} adorer of womanhood, {{as a sort}} of divine mystery,--a never-ending poem; and when his wife was long enough away from him to give scope for {{imagination}} to work, when she no longer annoyed him with the friction of the sharp little <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cold and selfish nature, he was able to see her once more in the ideal light of first love. After all, she was his wife; and in that one word, to a good man, is every thing holy and sacred. He longed to believe in her and trust her wholly; and now that Grace was going from him, to belong to another, Lillie was more than ever his dependence.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{perhaps it}} was when at the seaside in September, at Broadstairs, Herne Bay, or Dover, Crinoline and her mamma invigorated {{themselves}} with the sea-breezes of the ocean--{{perhaps it was}} there that she was enabled to assume that covering for her head in which her soul most delighted. It was a Tom and Jerry hat turned up at the sides, with a short but knowing feather, velvet trimmings, and a steel buckle blinking brightly in the noonday sun. Had Macassar seen her in this he would have yielded himself her captive at once, quarter or no quarter. It was the most marked, and perhaps the most attractive peculiarity of the Lady Crinoline's face, that the end of her nose was a little turned up. This charm, in unison with the upturned <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cruel-hearted hat, was found by many men to be invincible.|$|E

6000|$|Daisy {{came after}} eleven o'clock; {{but she was}} not, on such an occasion, a young lady to wait to be spoken to. She rustled forward in radiant loveliness, smiling and chattering, {{carrying}} a large bouquet, and attended by Mr. Giovanelli. Everyone stopped talking and {{turned and looked at}} her. She came straight to Mrs. Walker. [...] "I'm afraid you thought I never was coming, so I sent mother off to tell you. I wanted to make Mr. Giovanelli practice some things before he came; you know he sings beautifully, and I want you to ask him to sing. This is Mr. Giovanelli; you know I introduced him to you; he's got the most lovely voice, and he knows the most charming set of songs. I made him go over them this evening on purpose; we had the greatest time at the hotel." [...] Of all this Daisy delivered herself with the sweetest, brightest audibleness, looking now at her hostess and now round the room, while she gave a series of little pats, round her shoulders, to the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress.

6000|$|She hardly {{understood}} him, but yet she {{did as he}} told her, and in a {{few minutes}} she was standing on the other bank of the river, in the Ruden Platz. Here Linda perceived that there was a man awaiting them, to whom Ludovic gave certain orders about the boats. Then Ludovic took her by the hand and ran with her across the Platz, till they stood beneath the archway of the brewery warehouse where she had so often watched him as he went in and out. [...] "Here we are safe," [...] he said, stooping down and kissing her, and brushing away the drops of rain from the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair. Oh, what safety! To be there, {{in the middle of the}} night, with him, and not know whither she was to go, where she was to lie, whether she would ever again know that feeling of security which had been given to her throughout her whole life by her aunt's presence and the walls of her own house. Safe! Was ever peril equal to hers? [...] "Linda, say that you love me. Say that you are my own." ...|$|E
6000|$|Such {{sleep as}} she got was {{naturally}} fitful; she fancied she heard strange noises, but persuaded herself that they were caused by the breeze. She thought of her husband in some vague warm clime {{on the other side}} of the globe, while she was here in the cold. Was there another such a wretched being as she in the world? Tess asked herself; and, thinking of her wasted life, said, [...] "All is vanity." [...] She repeated the words mechanically, till she reflected that this was a most inadequate thought for modern days. Solomon had thought as far as that more than two thousand years ago; she herself, though not in the van of thinkers, had got much further. If all were only vanity, who would mind it? All was, alas, worse than vanity--injustice, punishment, exaction, death. The wife of Angel Clare put her hand to her brow, and felt its curve, and the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye-sockets perceptible under the soft skin, and thought as she did so that a time would come when that bone would be bare. [...] "I wish it were now," [...] she said.|$|E
