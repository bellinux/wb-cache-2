[...] As she talked, she looked at him {{precisely}} as one man looks at another, without the slightest false modesty or coquettishness. She evidently considered him a fellow-student on social affairs. [...] "I'm glad you liked my talk on the woman question. It was dreadfully radical to the most of my audience." ...|$|E

I am not equal to raking up the horror and {{the mystery of the}} past; I have not courage enough to open the grave of the martyred dead. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>me</b> when you came here? I have an immense imagination. It runs riot at times. It makes an actor of me. I play the parts of all the heroes that ever lived. I feel their characters. I merge myself in their individualities. For the time I am the man I fancy myself to be. I can't help it. I am obliged to do it. If I {{restrained}} my imagination when the fit is on me, I should go mad. I let myself loose. It lasts for hours. It leaves me with my energies worn out, with my sensibilities frightfully acute. Rouse any melancholy or terrible associations in me at such times, and I am capable of hysterics, I am capable of screaming. You heard me scream. You shall not see me in hysterics. No, Mrs. Valeria--no, you innocent reflection of the dead and gone--I would not frighten you for the world. Will you come here to-morrow in the daytime? I have got a chaise and a pony. Ariel, my delicate Ariel, can drive. She shall call at Mamma Macallan's and fetch you. We will talk to-morrow, when I am fit for it. I am dying to hear you. I will be fit for you in the morning. I will be civil, intelligent, communicative, in the morning. No more of it now. Away with the subject--the too exciting, the too interesting subject! I must compose myself or my brains will explode in my head. Music is the true narcotic for excitable brains. My harp! my harp!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Tommy {{lost sight}} and sound of Corp and the boy. What he seemed to see was a baby lark that had got out of its nest sideways, a fall of half a foot only, but a dreadful drop for a baby. [...] "You can get back this way," [...] its mother said, and showed it the way, which was quite easy, but when the baby tried to leap, it fell on its back. Then the mother marked out lines on the ground, {{from one to the}} other of which it was to {{practise}} hopping, and soon it could hop beautifully so long as its mother was there to say every moment, [...] "How beautifully you hop!" [...] "Now teach me to hop up," [...] the little lark said, meaning that it wanted to fly; and the mother tried to do that also, but in vain; she could soar up, up, up bravely, but could not explain how she did it. This distressed her very much, and she thought hard about how she had learned to fly long ago last year, but all she could recall for certain was that you suddenly do it. [...] "Wait till the sun comes out after rain," [...] she said, half remembering. [...] "What is sun? What is rain?" [...] the little bird asked. [...] "If you cannot teach me to fly, teach me to sing." [...] "When the sun comes out after rain," [...] the mother replied, [...] "then you will know how to sing." [...] The rain came, and glued the little bird's wings together. [...] "I shall never be able to fly nor to sing," [...] it wailed. Then, of a sudden, it had to blink its eyes; for a glorious light had spread over the world, catching every leaf and twig and blade of grass in tears, and putting a smile into every tear. The baby bird's breast swelled, it did not know why; and it fluttered from the ground, it did not know how. [...] "The sun has come out after the rain," [...] it trilled. [...] "Thank you, sun; thank you, thank you! Oh, mother, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>me?</b> I can sing!" [...] And it floated up, up, up, crying, [...] "Thank you, thank you, thank you!" [...] to the sun. [...] "Oh, mother, do you see me? I am flying!" [...] And being but a baby, it soon was gasping, but still it trilled the same ecstasy, and when it fell panting to earth it still trilled, and the distracted mother called to it to take breath or it would die, but it could not stop. [...] "Thank you, thank you, thank you!" [...] it sang to the sun till its little heart burst.|$|E
