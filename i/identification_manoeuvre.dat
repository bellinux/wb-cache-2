40|$|To achieve {{identification}} of the flight mechanical parameters of aircraft experimental techniques like free flight or wind tunnel tests are still essential, even if the numerical methods are getting better. But the mentioned techniques have both their disadvantages: On the one hand because the mounting of the model during wind tunnel measurements causes interference to the flow. On the other hand coupling effects caused by {{the movement of the}} aircraft in the flow can only determined with high costs – in some cases it is even not possible. The disadvantages of the free flight techniques consist of no reproducible conditions (atmospheric disturbances), high costs and the risk of manned test flights. The goal of this work which was conducted at the Chair of Flight Dynamics at the RWTH Aachen University was the creation of a reproducible free flight environment for the cost effective Identification of main flight mechanical parameters even in an early design stage. Therefore the advantages of the free flight techniques will be combined with the advantages of the Wind Tunnel techniques by bringing the free flight into the wind tunnel under laboratory conditions. The position and attitude of the aircraft is affiliated by a 3 D Camera System with high frequency and accuracy. Hence, the aircraft must only be equipped with sensor for the control surface positions and the revolution of the engine. The aircraft and the whole process are controlled by a real time system, which is implemented in Matlab/Simulink before. An adaptive identification algorithm, based on a regression in the frequency domain, generates the required excitation manoeuvre and analyses them in real time. Because the algorithm is adaptable, it needs only little a priori knowledge of the aircraft characteristics. The manoeuvre will be adapted until they fit most exactly to the eigenfrequency of the aircraft. The control algorithm has the function to reposition the aircraft after an <b>identification</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> and to trim. Additional, the algorithm takes control of the aircraft if it reaches the border of the free stream and tries to reposition it {{in the center of the}} wind tunnel. Because of the high non linearity and the agility of the aircraft the dynamic inversion is used. This is enhanced by a pseudo control hedging to avoid non linear rate- and deflection limits and to avoid the inversion of the dynamic of the actuator. As this combination is not very robust against uncertainties in the parameters, as they appear especially in this case, additionally adaptive terms in form of neural networks where included. After the free flight experiment an identification based on offline algorithms is conducted. Because of the higher resources even nonlinear models and better filter algorithms can be used. Because of the sensor concept, drift and bias in the signals do not exist. Therefore an equation error method is adequate.

40|$|High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) {{platforms}} are {{the aerial}} platforms capable of {{flying in the}} stratosphere {{for long periods of}} time. This master thesis presents aircraft system identification procedures geared towards such fixed wing platforms where aerodynamic forces and moments are parametrically modelled with so-called stability and control derivatives. The first part of the thesis addresses local System identification procedures intended for controller synthesis at low altitude flights whereas {{the second part of the}} thesis deals with a preliminary study on a new global system identification method. The local system identification procedure is based on the two step method, which offers flexibility regarding the aerodynamic structure. Therefore, it is suitable for the development of a system identification tool chain for various fixed wing platforms. Various system identification experiments have been conducted to collect flight test data. The parameters for the estimation of aerodynamic forces and moments are then found through an optimization procedure. Such parameters have been validated using a validation set from flight test data and their applicability for controller synthesis has been demonstrated. Global system identification typically requires the collection of flight test data at multiple points in the flight envelope and often, is combined with extensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solutions as well as wind-tunnel experiments. Such an approach is time consuming and costly. This thesis presents a new method to overcome the limitations of the current methodology by applying a Parameter search on VLM-based (Vortex Lattice Method) dynamic simulations of aircraft System <b>identification</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> and correcting the estimated models with available flight test data. The current study shows improvements in fidelity with decrease in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by factor 0. 2 and 0. 5 for x-axis and z-axis forces in body frame respectively, while reducing the effort for obtaining a model with similar fidelity...|$|R
40|$|The Italian Aerospace Research Centre (CIRA), in the {{framework}} of the Unmanned Space Vehicles (USV) Program, has developed several advanced Guidance, Navigation and Control technologies for the Terminal Area Energy Management (TAEM) phase of a re-entry ight. These technologies were in-flight tested during the first two dropped transonic flight tests (DTFT 1 and DTFT 2) of the program. These missions allowed CIRA to investigate critical technological aspects related to the autonomous execution of a typical TAEM phase of a re-entry flight, from a velocity of about Mach 2 down to the typical Approach/Landing Interface speed of Mach 0. 5 and below. This paper presents flight tests results and post flight data analysis of these missions. How technological innovations in the Guidance, Navigation and Control domain can contribute to a more autonomous, more safe and less costly future generation of reusable launch vehicles is well stated in open literature. In the USV program, focus was given to adaptive guidance with on-line trajectory re-planning capabilities and to robust and fault tolerant control, as key enabling technologies for atmospheric re-entry and hypersonic flight. Obviously, the complexity of such missions also required dedicated research on advanced methodologies in the field of robustness analysis, design and verification of GNC systems for highly uncertain and non-linear systems. Methodologies for vehicle model identification from flight data have been also included in this technological road map to maximize the scientific return from the flight tests. Model identification methodologies for processing flight data are frequently used to validate and improve a pre-flight aerodynamic data-base and, specifically, to reduce the associated uncertainties. However in this field conventional techniques need to be improved because the USV flight tests have a non-stationary trajectory and specific <b>identification</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> should be avoided being hazardous for the mission. More specifically, the problem of the identification of the aerodynamic model of the Italian Unmanned Space Vehicle was solved through a multi-step approach, where the aerodynamic coefficients are identified first and, in a following phase, a set of model parameters are updated. The methodology was applied to actual flight data, acquired during the two dropped transonic flight tests...|$|R

30|$|Data driven {{approaches}} {{could be}} a promising tool for modeling mixed traffic. They lead to flexible car-following models and thus to more robust and reliable representation of driving behavior. This simple methodological approach outperforms the reference (Gipps’) model for the available data. For the available data, speed prediction with RMSN 12 % is achieved using loess method, while 19 % using Gipps model. Data-driven estimation techniques are designed to address {{cases in which the}} traditional approaches do not perform well or cannot be effectively applied without including undue labor. Furthermore, the findings have interesting implications for the role of vehicle type. More specifically, vehicles pairs car– car and motorcycle–car (leader– follower) have almost 80 % of RMSN values lower than 0.1, while the curve of vehicle pair truck–car corresponds to higher RMSN. Regarding the <b>identification</b> of lane–changing <b>manoeuvres,</b> breakpoints are marked in positions with significant lateral changes for few trajectories and seem to correspond to lane changing manoeuvres. However, further experimental analysis is required.|$|R
40|$|System {{identification}} from {{flight data}} {{is an essential}} task in aerospace field, both for research and industrial activities. Indeed, ground based tests are not fully exhaustive of the vehicle behaviour and in-flight experimentation is often mandatory. In particular, there is a specific interest in obtaining vehicle model characteristics from flight data, {{in order to better}} understand theoretical predictions of physical phenomena, to validate wind-tunnel test results and to get more accurate and reliable mathematical models of the vehicle. The availability of these models is one of the critical items in order to guarantee the competitiveness of the aerospace industry, because it allows designing flight control law, evaluating vehicle performance and handling qualities, performing fault diagnosis and reconfiguration, developing high fidelity simulators, while reducing the flight test time and therefore reducing cost, risks and time to market of new products. Although in the last decades several methodologies have been developed and many applications have been successful demonstrated, there are still open problems and challenges in system identification, mainly related to model complexity, high bandwidth requirements, constraints on flight test manoeuvres due to safety reason, dynamically unstable response, accurate characterisation of model uncertainties. In the present work an innovative system identification methodology is described, which is suitable for dealing with some of the above listed challenges. The proposed methodology is implemented in the framework of a multi-step approach, which decomposes the complex starting identification problem in simplified sub-problems and allows specifying a suitable estimation technique compliant with each sub-problem objective, exploiting the advantage of both time-domain and frequency-domain methods. The straightforward combination of several estimation techniques brings to an identified model which is applicable in a wide frequency range. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is suitable to deal with problems where <b>identification</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> are minimised, indeed the identification can be executed only for the sub-model which is in fact identifiable. Another relevant peculiarity of the proposed approach concerns the exploitation of all the available a priori information and the rigorous management of all the uncertainties involved in the system identification procedure. As a result, a reliable, complete, and structured statistical characterisation of the identified model could be obtained. Proposed methodology is applied in this thesis to determine the dynamical characteristics of rotorcraft vehicles and the transonic aerodynamic model of an atmospheric re-entry space demonstrator. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through numerical assessments, which enhanced the capability to catch the true values of the model parameters and to reproduce the phenomena of interest. Moreover, the application to actual flight data of the CIRA FTB 1 re-entry demonstrator allowed to validate and refine the available pre-flight aerodynamic model of the vehicle, in terms of nominal values update and significant reduction on model uncertainties. These results justifies the importance of flight tests and, in particular, of system identification from flight data. The availability of an updated aerodynamic model represents a fundamental step {{for the development of the}} upgraded version of the Guidance, Navigation and Control system for the next missions of the same configuration, where the accuracy of estimates and the reliability of the model over an expanded flight envelope will be carefully analysed and assessed. All the activities hereafter reported have been basically performed at the Italian Aerospace Research Centre (CIRA), where the author is the scientific coordinator of the Modelling and Simulation Laboratory, with the collaboration, advice and support of University “Federico II” that hosted the PhD period...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{nonlinear}} dynamic {{neural network}} model is proposed for the <b>identification</b> of ship <b>manoeuvring</b> coefficients. A generalized Widrow-Hoff learning rule in feed-forward, back propagation networks give reasonable answers when presented with inputs not previously seen. With a proper optimization technique, the network is an excellent choice for nonlinear system identification, using reliable and inexpensive computing hardware. It is shown that these networks {{can be used to}} identify ship manoeuvres in every practical application, including an open-loop manner. An efficient, quick off-line training process allows the use of neural networks in predicting the ship's future position, speed and heading with input from rudder angle, engine rpm and the ship kinematics. Dealing with input noise from ship sensors is implicit in the proposed method and is very effective, in fact some level of noise is necessary for the training purposes. In the paper the combination of the MMG standard manoeuvring model with the neural network prediction simulates the real-time realization of ship manoeuvring.

40|$|The shallow gravity {{gradient}} in the libration point regions enables manoeuvring at low ∆v expenses, but implicates a sensitivity to small perturbations. A variety of bounded orbits {{can be determined}} around each libration point and station-keeping is required to maintain them for multiple revolutions. In this paper, a station-keeping algorithm based on the orbital lifetime expectancy is proposed for so-called quasi-periodic solutions. The method introduced {{is based on the}} <b>identification</b> of a <b>manoeuvre</b> maximising the lifetime of an orbit within defined boundaries. The manoeuvre direction and magnitude is finally optimised with a differential evolution algorithm. The novelty of the method presented here is the identification of the downstream centre manifold by the lifetime analysis to preserve the orbit with its properties forward in time. The study shows that the manoeuvre direction is directly correlated to stability information that is provided by the Floquet modal theory. Finally, numerical calculations were carried out for trajectories around the far-side libration point in the Earth-Moon system to show the effectiveness of this station-keeping approach. The robustness is proven by the introduction of errors and the evaluation of their impact...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the 4 -Dimensional Trajectory (4 DT) optimisation algorithm implemented {{to avoid a}} variety of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal degradations predicted by an Avionics Based Integrity Augmentation system (ABIA). The paper focusses on descent and initial curved GNSS approach phases in a dense Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) scenario, with multiple aircraft converging on the same short and curved final GNSS approach leg. The reference platform for {{this study is the}} Javelin Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS). The 4 DT optimisation algorithm implements three degrees-of-freedom aircraft dynamics models as well as suitable GNSS satellite visibility models based on Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation ephemeris data. Direct transcription methods of the global orthogonal (pseudospectral) collocation family are implemented, generating optimal high-integrity trajectories for curved GNSS approaches in real-time. The optimal trajectories calculated by the pseudospectral method are subsequently processed by control input smoothing and <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>identification</b> algorithms to translate the mathematical optimum into a pilot- /autopilot-flyable and concisely described 4 DT intent.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} of integrating Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Avionics Based Integrity Augmentation (ABIA) functionalities in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) to perform mission planning and real-time trajectory optimisation tasks. In case of mission planning, a pseudo-spectral optimization technique is adopted. For real-time trajectory optimisation a Direct Constrained Optimisation (DCO) method is employed. In this method the aircraft dynamics model is used to generate a number of feasible flight trajectories that also satisfy the GNSS integrity constraints. The feasible trajectories are calculated by initialising the aircraft dynamics model with a <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>identification</b> algorithm. The performance of the proposed GNSS integrity augmentation and trajectory optimisation algorithms was evaluated in representative simulation case studies. Additionally, the ABIA performance was compared with Space-Based and Ground-Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS/GBAS). Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed integration scheme is capable of performing safety-critical UAS tasks (CAT III precision approach, UAS Detect-and-Avoid, etc.) when GNSS is used as the primary source of navigation data. There is a synergy with SBAS/GBAS in providing suitable (predictive and reactive) integrity flags in all flight phases. Therefore, the integration of ABIA with SBAS/GBAS is a clear opportunity for future research towards the development of a Space-Ground-Avionics Augmentation Network (SGAAN) for UAS SAA and other safety-critical aviation applications...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} a low-cost standalone MEMS-IMU (micro-electromechanical system - inertial measurement unit) sensor system developed by the National Research Council Canada (NRC) for manoeuvre recognition in helicopters. The system records accelerations, angular rotation rates, magnetic flux, altitude, location and velocity through its IMU and GPS. The MEMS-IMU system was flown on the Bell 412 CH- 146 Griffon helicopter in a series of scripted flights consisting of 60 manoeuvres and regimes from the helicopter's usage spectrum. A flight log recorded by passengers with detailed start and stop times and <b>identification</b> of the <b>manoeuvres</b> during flight was key information in the development of manoeuvre recognition models. Statistical tests to analyze the data diversity between each flight showed significant variability of the parameters from flight to flight. Because of this variability and because there was significant imbalance in the distribution of data for the individual manoeuvres, a pooled stratified sampling scheme was used to construct a representative training set for developing data-driven models. Different subsets of the MEMSIMU measurements were explored to exclude GPS and/or magnetometer readings. Even with the different subsets, the classifier results using stratified sampling show that very high overall classification accuracy can be obtained using the measurements from the standalone MEMS-IMU sensor system.
