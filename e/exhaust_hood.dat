Using thermal displacement venti-lation in kitchen environment allows for a reduction in space temperature without increasing the air-conditioning system capacity.

This study reports capture efficiencies (CE) measured for cooking generated particles for scripted cooking procedures in a 121 -m 3 chamber with kitchenette.

The study used four <b>exhaust</b> <b>hoods</b> previously tested by Delp and Singer (Environ. Sci. Technol., 2012, 46, 6167 - 6173). For pan-frying a hamburger over medium heat on the back burner, CEs for particles {{were similar to those}} for burner produced CO 2 and mostly above 80 percent. For stir-frying green beans in a wok (high heat, front burner), CEs for burner CO 2 during cooking varied by hood and airflow: CEs were 34 - 38 percent for low (51 ? 68 L s- 1) and 54 ? 72 percent for high (109 ? 138 L s- 1) settings. CEs for 0. 3 ? 2. 0 ?m particles during front burner stir-frying were 3 ? 11 percent on low and 16 ? 70 percent on high settings.

40|$|Investigations on the {{coupling}} flow between full-scale last-stage steam turbine and low-pressure <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> Jing-Lun Fu and Jian-Jun Liu In a condensing steam turbine, the last-stage turbine and the condenser are connected by the low-pressure axial–radial <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood.</b> The <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> has a complex geometry {{to make the}} flow change direction by 90, while guiding the flow from the turbine to the condenser. During the operation, strong flow interactions between the turbine and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> cause the flow pattern to become extremely complicated. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate {{the coupling}} flow between the full-scale last-stage turbine and the low-pressure <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> of a 600 MW steam turbine under actual operation conditions.

Equilibrium wet steam was selected as the flow medium. The coupling flow fields under different operation conditions were simulated and analyzed. It is found that the distributions of the turbine exit flow fields at different circumferential locations vary remarkably. The profiles of swirl angle and total pressure distributions at the turbine outlet change with the decrease of the mass flowrate, which further influence the flow behavior in the hood and lead to the reduction of the performance...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the computational modelling of low pressure (LP) steam turbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> flows. A test case for LP last stage blades (LSBs) {{with a full}} aerodynamic definition and an accompanying <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> was developed which is representative of current industrial practice. The test case geometry is freely available allowing other researchers to build on this work and {{is the first of}} its kind. Studies on this Durham Stage and <b>Exhaust</b> <b>Hood</b> Test Case showed the geometry produces a representative flow pattern and performance metrics comparable to other published research. Using the test case, the effect of condenser cooling water pressure gradient on the hood flow was computed for the first time. A generic boundary condition was developed to represent the transverse condenser cooling water flow and, when applied to the test case, was shown to have a larger influence on the flow asymmetry within the hood than the tip leakage jet. This thesis describes the first application of the non-linear harmonic (NLH) method to couple the LSBs to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood.</b> This method enabled the circumferential non-uniformity which develops in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> to be transferred across the interface to the stage, in half the computational demand of the full annulus frozen rotor approach. The first review of the influence of inlet circumferential asymmetry on the hood flow field highlighted that modelling its effect is not as crucial as indicated in the literature, unless the diffuser axial length is very compact or if off-design flows are to be studied. A series of recommendations and guidelines for the CFD modelling of steam turbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> flows based on this work are supplied. Experimental validation of the Durham Stage and <b>Exhaust</b> <b>Hood</b> Test Case and a comparison of full unsteady studies with the NLH method should be the next steps in this research...|$|E
50|$|Ventilation {{systems can}} be local or general. Local exhaust {{ventilation}} operates {{at or near the}} source of contamination, often in conjunction with an enclosure. Examples of local exhaust systems include fume hoods, gloveboxes, biosafety cabinets, and vented balance enclosures. <b>Exhaust</b> <b>hoods</b> lacking an enclosure are less preferable, and laminar flow hoods are not recommended because they direct air outwards towards the worker. General exhaust ventilation operates on an entire room through a building's HVAC system. It is inefficient and costly as compared to local exhaust ventilation, and should not be relied upon for controlling exposure, although it can provide negative room pressure to prevent contaminants from exiting the room. Several control verification techniques can be used with ventilation systems, including pitot tubes, hot-wire anemometers, smoke generators, tracer-gas leak testing, and standardized testing and certification procedures.|$|R

40|$|The <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> of a {{steam turbine}} {{is a vital}} area of {{turbomachinery}} research its performance strongly influences the power output of the last stage blades. It {{is well known that}} accurate CFD simulations are only achieved when the last stage blades are coupled to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> to capture the strong interaction. This however presents challenges as the calculation size grows rapidly when the full annulus is calculated. The size of the simulation means researchers are constantly searching of methods to reduce the computational effort without compromising solution accuracy. This work uses a novel approach, by coupling the last stage blades and <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> by the Non-Linear Harmonic Method, a technique widely used to reduce calculation size in high pressure turbine blades and axial compressors. This has been benchmarked against the widely adopted Mixing Plane method. The test case used is the Generic Geometry, a representative <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> and last stage blade geometry that is free from confidentiality and IP restrictions and for which first calculations were presented at last year’s conference [1]. The results show that the non-uniform <b>exhaust</b> <b>hood</b> inlet flow can be captured using the non-liner harmonic method, an effect not previously achievable with single passage coupled calculations such as the mixing plane approach. This offers a significant computational saving, estimated to be a quarter of the computation time compared with alternative methods of capturing the asymmetry with full annulus frozen rotor calculations...|$|E
