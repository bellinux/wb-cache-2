After {{experiencing}} {{the power of the}} wapaq, Raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children, the people, could learn from it. Among the Koryaks, one report said that the poor would consume the urine of the wealthy, who could afford to buy the mushrooms.|$|E

500|$|The game {{does not}} {{explicitly}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>story,</b> {{but has a}} narrative line that connects the disparate worlds. There are 17 worlds, each with unique characters, a single primary goal, and secondary activities. In [...] "Lamp Lighting", the player activates lights while flying past silhouettes, and each light adds a new layer of music. The player flies {{through a series of}} color-changing circles to access the next world. In Sponge Land, an underwater world, the player gathers fish to swim alongside the Long Mover. The player can collect seeds in the Kite Village. Another level lets the player create shapes in the sky by flying past stars. The worlds are presented in flat colors with no outlines, and all worlds are unlocked {{from the beginning of the}} game. The credits roll once a hidden multicolored serpent is freed from each level.|$|E
500|$|Within {{months of}} the novel's release, {{computer}} gaming company I-Play began developing a downloadable casual-play game based on the story. [...] Roberts' input was limited to approval of the graphics and the game's interpretation of the story line. [...] The game followed the general plot of the novel, {{from the perspective of}} the heroine. [...] More than 40 different locations from the book were featured, including Mac's office and Carter's kitchen. [...] There were hidden-object tasks and several mini-games featuring wedding-related activities, such as cake decorating and floral arranging. [...] Roberts was pleased with the final product, remarking that [...] "to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> translated into a game like this, it's tremendous fun for me. It's my initial vision, but I enjoy seeing how, when you translate it into that other medium, how somebody else's vision manages to affect it but keep the core of the story." [...] The game was released in February 2010. [...] According to Roberts' website, game sales did not match the developer's expectations, and plans for sequels to the game were cancelled.|$|E
500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{wrote an}} {{extremely}} negative {{review of the}} episode and called it [...] "terrible". He felt that Pam's behavior due to Jim being gone was uncalled for. Furthermore, he felt that Dwight [...] "swung too far into the territory that is known as 'annoying caricature. Campbell did, however, write highly of Ellie Kemper, saying that [...] "she's played [...] funnily and warmly as anyone else". Several reviewers argued that the episode functioned as a filler episode. Brett Davinger of The California Literary Review called it the [...] "epitome of filler". ScreenCrush reviewer Damon Houx wrote that [...] "if everyone {{were in the same}} location this would be a bottle episode". Furthermore, Darryl's subplot was mostly criticized. Tedder wrote that while [...] "it's fine to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> line where someone pursues something and then realizes it wasn't what it was cracked up to be" [...] he wished that the show had actually developed Val as a character. White wrote that she did not enjoy seeing [...] "this manipulative version of Darryl" [...] because it contrasted with his earlier characterization in episodes like [...] "The Deposition". Zaman called the subplot [...] "surprising".|$|E

500|$|The Creative Assembly wanted Alien: Isolation to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> {{that was}} {{closely related to}} the film. As a result, the team decided to explore a story set 15 years after the events of the film which would involve Ellen Ripley's {{daughter}} and the Nostromos flight recorder. Writer Will Porter explained that the process of creating a backstory for Amanda was [...] "refreshing" [...] as he felt that she was an overlooked character of the Alien universe. The derelict ship the Nostromo crew previously found in the film was also included in the game since the developers felt it was a central point in the Alien canon. Actress Sigourney Weaver agreed to reprise her role as Ellen Ripley to voice small sections throughout the game because she felt that the story was interesting and true to the film. Along with Weaver, the original Alien cast, which includes Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, and Yaphet Kotto, reprised their roles for the game's separate downloadable content missions, marking the first time they were brought back together since the release of the film. All the characters were created with 3D face scans.|$|E
500|$|What Maisie Knew {{was written}} by Carroll Cartwright and Nancy Doyne in 1995, based on the 1897 novel What Maisie Knew by Henry James. At the time, Cartwright was {{involved}} in a legal dispute over the custody of his daughter. Director Scott McGehee later said that Cartwright had used James' novel [...] "as a lens" [...] through which to write about his own divorce and raising his daughter. According to Cartwright, he and Doyne struggled to find producers, financiers and directors interested in making the film because of the challenges of working with a young child at its center. Producer Charles Weinstock was involved in the project {{for a number of years}} and was eventually responsible for obtaining financing from Red Crown Productions and hiring McGehee and David Siegel as directors. McGehee and Siegel were initially apprehensive about the script but decided to read it after hearing from their agent that actress Julianne Moore was interested in playing one of the roles; they accepted the directing job after talking to Moore about the story. Although McGehee and Siegel were reluctant to make a film about divorce, they liked that the script focused on Maisie's perspective, noting that it was unusual for a film aimed at adults to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> told from the perspective of a child.|$|E
500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E

500|$|... "Adrift" [...] was {{produced}} {{as part of}} its own production block: block seven. Filming of the episode was [...] "double banked" [...] with block five, which consisted of the episodes [...] "From Out of the Rain" [...] and [...] "Fragments". This accounted for the lack of availability of some of the regular cast members. Unlike the rest of the episodes in the series, this episode was not solely produced by regular series Richard Stokes but by guest producer Sophie Fante. Discussing the premise of the story writer Chris Chibnall states that [...] "the issue of loss" [...] is what drives the narrative and that he had [...] "always wanted to write a story about people who go missing". Director Mark Everest noted that [...] "people go missing all the time" [...] and that to tackle this theme was [...] "a brave thing to do". Executive producer Russell T Davies felt it provided good drama to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that would also examine elements of [...] "paranoia" [...] and [...] "fear" [...] and [...] "mistrust" [...] between Gwen and Jack as result of her realising she does not know the full extent of his work within Torchwood. Davies later stated in his book The Writer's Tale that [...] "Adrift" [...] was one of the scripts that [...] "paved the way" [...] for the third series of the show; his intention being to write Torchwood characters as [...] "real people" [...] with [...] "families, feuds, aches and pains". The episode underwent less rewriting than any other script from the first two series with the final version being essentially a second draft. Gwen was initially referred to by her husband's surname, Williams, but Eve Myles vetoed this idea as she believed that an independent professional woman would want to keep her maiden name. A change made in the editing of the episode was the cutting of a short scene hinting at a possible romance between Nikki and Andy. This scene is included in the deleted scenes included in the series two boxset.|$|E
500|$|Alan Stanley Blair of Airlock Alpha {{gave the}} episode a mixed review. He {{felt it was}} {{refreshing}} to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about aliens that weren't invading and opined that [...] "the brutal scenes at the abattoir and the whale-like moans of agony from the beast tug on a few heartstrings." [...] However, he criticised the realisation of the alien describing it as [...] "basically a giant, moaning turd {{sitting in the middle}} of a warehouse" [...] and [...] "a large lump of putty with eyes". He felt that the episode gave Rhys [...] "a chance to step into the spotlight for a change and prove he has what it takes to carry a story" [...] and felt his reaction to the existence of aliens to be [...] "perhaps the most realistic that the genre has produced". Despite this, he felt that Rhys finding out about Torchwood put an end to the [...] "fun" [...] of Gwen [...] "keeping secrets and concealing her double life" [...] and expressed disappointment that Jack didn't wipe his memory at the end of the episode. Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 7.6 on a one to ten scale and felt it provided a [...] "messy, odd and somewhat unsettling twist on alien encounters" [...] but felt the episode had several weak points. He felt it was hard not to see Rhys as [...] "a buffoon" [...] and questioned why Torchwood would use a civilian during a sting operation. He also felt that it pushed [...] "beyond the limits of its capacity to create convincing special effects" [...] and the creature itself looked like [...] "a hand puppet". Andrew Mickel of Den of Geek felt that Rhys has always been the [...] "Welsh heart of the show" [...] and praised his role in the episode for being [...] "actually rather entertaining, approaching everything with invigorating gusto." [...] However he also criticised the denouement of the episode for being [...] "daftly mawkish" [...] and opined that [...] "it’s always impossible to care about CGI characters".|$|E

2500|$|My claim, so {{offensive}} to some, {{that the first}} task {{of the church is}} to make the world the world, not to make the world more just, is a correlative of this theological metaphysics.

Lewis wrote in his journal that the Little People were [...] "deavals" [...] (devils) with very large heads, about [...] high, and very alert to any intrusions into their territory. The Sioux said that the devils carried sharp arrows which could strike at a very long distance, and that they killed anyone who approached their mound.
