5|$|Sanchez {{became the}} first USC quarterback to leave school early <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> since Todd Marinovich did so after the 1990 season.

Despite the public disagreement, the two {{remained}} close afterward.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the regular}} season, a {{constant}} question {{hanging over the}} Virginia Tech Hokies football team was whether or not star quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year at the school. The National Football League requires that players be {{at least three years}} out of high school before they are eligible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> Draft. Vick, who had not played during his freshman year at the school, would be three years out of high school in the spring following the Gator Bowl.|$|E

Youngblood was also a regular guest on ESPN programs Star-Shot (1988), Sportslook (1984, 1986, 1988) and Great Outdoors (1989) programs.|$|E
5|$|For the 1967 NFL season, the NFL {{expanded}} to 16 teams, and split its two conferences into two divisions each, with four teams in each division. The four division champions would {{advance to the}} NFL playoffs, and to remain on schedule, a tie-breaker system was introduced. The first round of playoffs determined the conference's champion and its representative in the NFL Championship Game, played the following week. Thus, 1967 was the first season there was a scheduled playoff tournament to determine the teams to play <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> Championship.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was SI.com's Midseason 2007 NFL Draft Projection #1pick, though Johnson had {{stated that}} he {{intended}} to earn his degree from Georgia Tech. On January 8, 2007, Johnson declared himself eligible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> Draft, bypassing his senior season at Georgia Tech. He was regarded as the best athlete {{to come out of the}} draft and was the #1player on most draft boards. Johnson was said by ESPN to be able to be productive as a rookie, much like receiver Randy Moss was as a rookie. In a mid-February workout with speed and conditioning coach Mark Pearsall, Johnson clocked a 4.33-second 40-yard dash, recorded an 11-foot standing broad jump, and had a vertical leap of 43inches.|$|E

He hired Jeff Nalley and Vann McElroy as his agents prior to the draft, and they hired former NFL quarterback Jerry Rhome to work with Kolb to get him ready for the pre-draft workouts. He worked out with Danny Arnold in Stafford, Texas in February 2007 in order to prepare <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> Scouting Combine. Kolb worked out for the Baltimore Ravens {{in the first week of}} April, and followed it up with a visit to the Philadelphia Eagles.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1977, Sayers was {{inducted}} into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and is still the youngest inductee in its history. On October 31, 1994, at halftime of a Monday night game, the Bears retired his number 40 at Soldier Field, along with number 51, which had been worn by teammate, linebacker Dick Butkus. The Pro Football Hall of Fame selection committee named Sayers to its NFL 1960s All-Decade Team, which comprised the best players of the 1960s at each position. In 1994, Sayers was selected <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> 75th Anniversary All-Time Team as both a halfback and a kickoff returner; he was the only player selected for multiple positions. In 1999, despite the brevity of his career, he was ranked 22nd on The Sporting Newss list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.|$|E
5|$|Of all the draft-eligible juniors, Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, Adrian Hubbard, Cyrus Kouandjio, Jeoffrey Pagan and Vinnie Sunseri {{declared}} their {{eligibility for}} the 2014 NFL Draft. At {{the time of}} their announcement, Clinton-Dix and Kouandjio were projected to be first-round picks and both Hubbard and Pagan were projected to be no lower than third-round picks. With their departures it marked the first time during the Saban era that more than three juniors declared early <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> Draft. In February 2014, twelve Alabama players, seven seniors and five juniors, were invited to the NFL Scouting Combine. The invited players were offensive linemen Cyrus Kouandjio and Anthony Steen, safeties Ha Ha Clinton-Dix and Vinnie Sunseri, linebackers Adrian Hubbard and C. J. Mosley, defensive ends Jeoffrey Pagan and Ed Stinson, quarterback AJ McCarron, wide receiver Kevin Norwood, cornerback Deion Belue and punter Cody Mandell.|$|E

5|$|The Browns {{struggled}} after Graham {{retired in}} 1956 and ended {{the regular season}} at 5–7, their first-ever losing record. After the season, Brown traded the 35-year-old Gatski to the Detroit Lions for a draft pick after Gatski asked for a raise. He only played in the 1957 season with the Lions. Detroit beat the Browns <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> championship that year. By the time he retired after the 1957 season, Gatski had played on eight championship teams, a professional football record. Gatski did not miss a practice or a game during his 12 seasons in football.|$|E
5|$|After Denard Robinson left <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL,</b> sophomore Russell Bellomy, {{the only}} {{scholarship}} quarterback {{on the roster}} other than Devin Gardner, endured a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury. The injury left the team without a healthy backup who had ever taken an official snap. True freshman Morris competed with redshirt freshman walk-on Brian Cleary for the backup role. On August 22, 2013 as a true freshman, Morris was named backup quarterback to redshirt junior Gardner. He made his debut for the 2013 team in the season opener against Central Michigan. Passing for 59 yards on 4-for-6 passing, {{he was one of}} 11 true freshmen to play in the game for Michigan. Morris also played in the Michigan–Michigan State football rivalry on November 2 against the 2013 Michigan State Spartans, completing only one pass (on three attempts) for six yards. Gardner suffered a turf toe injury prior to the 2013 team's 2013 Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl against Kansas State. With Gardner held out of practices, Morris got extensive work. Morris started in place of Gardner in the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl, compiling 196 yards on 2438 passing.|$|E
5|$|At Wisconsin, {{he was a}} four–year starter at cornerback. He {{finished}} his career with a recovered fumble and 12 interceptions, returning one for a touchdown. Before his junior season in 2000, he was suspended one game for receiving unadvertised discounts at a shoe store. After the season, he was given second–team All–Big Ten Conference honors. In 2002, after graduating from Wisconsin, he declared <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> Draft. He was drafted by the Titans and debuted later that season. However, after four weeks, he injured his leg and missed {{the rest of the}} season. The following season, he saw limited action before being released by the team in 2004. After his stint with the Titans ended, he spent time with the Atlanta Falcons, Indianapolis Colts, and Detroit Lions, failing to appear in a game for any of the teams. In 2006, Echols played his final professional game for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the CFL, intercepting a pass in his only game for the team.|$|E

5|$|In winning all {{of their}} regular season games and the AAFC championship, the Browns {{recorded}} the first perfect season in professional football {{since the advent of}} NFL championships in 1933. The feat has been duplicated only once since, by the Miami Dolphins in 1972. When the AAFC faltered and dissolved after the 1949 season and the NFL absorbed the Browns, their new league did not recognize AAFC statistics, including the perfect season. The Pro Football Hall of Fame, however, recognizes it as a perfect season. In 2008, United States Senator Sherrod Brown, who represents Ohio in the United States Congress, sent a letter to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell asking the league to recognize AAFC championships and team records including the perfect season. At the time, the New England Patriots were undefeated as they prepared for the Super Bowl against the New York Giants, a game they went on to lose. Dante Lavelli also advocated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> to adopt AAFC records.|$|E
5|$|Joel Enterprises of Richmond {{was listed}} as one of Vick's larger creditors. Sports agents Andrew Joel and Dave Lowman claimed Vick signed a {{contract}} with their firm in 2001, nine days before he announced he was leaving Virginia Tech early and declaring himself eligible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> Draft. With his mother as a witness, Vick signed a five-year marketing agreement that anticipated a wide range of endorsement activities using Vick's name, likeness, voice, and reputation. Joel's cut was 25% of all deals, excluding Vick's NFL contract, according to the agreement. Vick attempted to end the relationship with Joel Enterprises a few weeks later, and entered into another relationship with other agents. In 2005, Joel Enterprises sued Vick in Richmond Circuit Court for $45 million in compensatory and punitive damages for breach of contract. After the Virginia Supreme Court denied a Vick motion and ruled that the civil trial could proceed in December 2006, the parties agreed to submit the dispute to binding arbitration for resolution instead of a formal civil court trial. The outcome of the case was an award of $4.5 million to Joel.|$|E
5|$|Rod Jones {{was known}} as a hard hitter and a {{world-class}} track star, but was a controversial selection because, coming from the run-heavy Southwest Conference, his pass-coverage skills were unknown. At 5'11", 165lbs., he was considered undersized <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>NFL.</b> Jones was the first defensive back selected, but was rated no better than fifth-best by most scouting services. The Buccaneers were criticized for taking linebacker Jackie Walker with their third pick, when Kevin Murphy of the national champion Oklahoma Sooners was still available. The Buccaneers did eventually draft Murphy, who they were surprised to find still available with their 40th overall selection. Murphy was believed to have fallen due to rumors of a knee injury. The Buccaneers had rated both Walker and Murphy among the top 15 players in the draft. Craig Swoope was rated as the best safety in the draft, but fell to the fourth round because of a previous charge (and acquittal) of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Swoope was eventually the only Buccaneer to achieve any kind of postseason honors in 1986, being selected to the Football Digest All-Rookie team. The team went for big offensive linemen in the later rounds. One of them was J.D. Maarleveld, the first cancer patient drafted by the NFL. Maarleveld was considered to have been a second-round talent, but fell {{all the way to the}} fifth round. Belief that Maarleveld was worth much more money than the average fifth-rounder caused his agent, Greg Marotta, to advise him to reject the Buccaneers' offer and sign with the USFL Baltimore Stars. Maarleveld was eventually able to reach agreement with the Buccaneers.|$|E
