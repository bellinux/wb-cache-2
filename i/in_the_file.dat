25|$|Various {{optimizations}} and tweaks to {{the implementation}} of FAT file system drivers, block device drivers and disk tools have been devised to overcome most of the performance bottlenecks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> system's inherent design without having to change the layout of the on-disk structures. They can be divided into on-line and off-line methods and work by trying to avoid fragmentation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> system in the first place, deploying methods to better cope with existing fragmentation, and by reordering and optimizing the on-disk structures. With optimizations in place, the performance on FAT volumes can often reach that of more sophisticated file systems in practical scenarios, {{while at the same time}} retaining the advantage of being accessible even on very small or old systems.|$|E
25|$|Solution Explorer: In Visual Studio parlance, a {{solution}} {{is a set}} of code files and other resources that are used to build an application.

25|$|As {{the number}} of {{independent}} processors in a supercomputer increases, the way they access data <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> system and how they share and access secondary storage resources becomes prominent. Over the years a number of systems for distributed file management were developed, e.g., the IBM General Parallel File System, BeeGFS, the Parallel Virtual File System, Hadoop, etc. A number of supercomputers on the TOP100 list such as the Tianhe-I use Linux's Lustre file system.|$|E

The 2i command also goes into insert mode, and will insert the entered text (a single empty line in our case) before line two.

50|$|To {{locate a}} <b>file,</b> <b>the</b> {{directory}} names <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file's</b> path can be checked sequentially, {{going to the}} location of each directory to obtain the location of the subsequent subdirectory. However, a file can also be located through the path table provided by <b>the</b> <b>file</b> system. This path table stores information about each directory, its parent and its location on disk. Since the path table is stored in a contiguous region, it can be searched much faster than jumping to the particular locations of each directory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file's</b> path, thus reducing seek time.|$|R
25|$|The Windows Executive {{services}} {{make up the}} low-level kernel-mode portion, and {{are contained}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> NTOSKRNL.EXE.

These are divided into several subsystems, among which are Cache Manager, Configuration Manager, I/O Manager, Local Procedure Call (LPC), Memory Manager, Object Manager, Process Structure and Security Reference Monitor (SRM). Grouped together, the components can be called Executive services (internal name Ex). System Services (internal name Nt), i.e., system calls, are implemented at this level, too, except very few that call directly into the kernel layer for better performance.|$|E
25|$|GIF is palette-based: {{the colors}} {{used in an}} image (a frame) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> have their RGB values defined in a palette table that can hold up to 256 entries, and {{the data for the}} image refer to the colors by their indices (0–255) in the palette table. The color {{definitions}} in the palette can be drawn from a color space of millions of shades (224 shades, 8 bits for each primary), but the maximum number of colors a frame can use is 256. This limitation seemed reasonable when GIF was developed because few people could afford the hardware to display more colors simultaneously. Simple graphics, line drawings, cartoons, and grey-scale photographs typically need fewer than 256 colors.|$|E
25|$|Basic {{animation}} {{was added}} to the GIF89a spec via the Graphics Control Extension (GCE), which allows various images (frames) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file</b> to be painted with time delays, forming a video clip. An animated GIF file comprises a number of frames that are displayed in succession, each introduced by its own GCE, which gives the time delay to wait after the frame is drawn. Global information {{at the start of the}} file applies by default to all frames. The data is stream-oriented, so the file-offset of the start of each GCE depends on the length of preceding data. Within each frame the LZW-coded image data is arranged in sub-blocks of up to 255 bytes; the size of each sub-block is declared by the byte that precedes it.|$|E

25|$|Objects may {{be either}} direct (embedded in another object) or indirect. Indirect objects are {{numbered}} with an object number and a generation number and defined between the obj and endobj keywords. An index table, {{also called the}} cross-reference table and marked with the xref keyword, follows the main body and gives the byte offset of each indirect object {{from the start of}} the file. This design allows for efficient random access to the objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> and also allows for small changes to be made without rewriting the entire file (incremental update). Beginning with PDF version 1.5, indirect objects may also be located in special streams known as object streams. This technique reduces the size of files that have large numbers of small indirect objects and is especially useful for Tagged PDF.|$|E
25|$|Btrieve for Windows {{was created}} {{before the company}} rewrote the {{codebase}} to use the MKDE. It featured SEFS and MEFS file sharing mechanisms; used shadow-paging and allowed for exclusive and concurrent locks. It handled version 6.x and 6.1 files differently. Version 6.x files could handle operations on part of a record rather than locking the entire record. It handled records larger than 64KB, implemented VATs, ACSs, new data types, allowed for percentage operations (where the record could be located and manipulated by the physical location <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file)</b> and handled duplicate keys. Version 6.x was capable of dropping or adding any index on the fly (version 6.0 and below could drop only supplemental indexes). Version 6.1 files allowed for concurrent and system transactions, the optional renumbering of keys, case insensitive ACS tables, and enhanced locking operations.|$|E
25|$|The name of {{the file}} system {{originates}} from the file system's prominent usage of an index table, the File Allocation Table, statically allocated {{at the time of}} formatting. The table contains entries for each cluster, a contiguous area of disk storage. Each entry contains either the number of the next cluster <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>file,</b> or else a marker indicating end of file, unused disk space, or special reserved areas of the disk. The root directory of the disk contains the number of the first cluster of each file in that directory; the operating system can then traverse the FAT table, looking up the cluster number of each successive part of the disk file as a cluster chain {{until the end of the}} file is reached. In much the same way, sub-directories are implemented as special files containing the directory entries of their respective files.|$|E
