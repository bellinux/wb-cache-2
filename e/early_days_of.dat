Classical techniques helped her to play with her voice, so she decided not to pursue extra training in rock/pop singing.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Sicilian Baroque, the first {{buildings}} of the new neoclassical era were often copies or hybrids of the two styles. The Palazzo Ducezio (Illustration 19) was begun in 1746, and the ground floor with arcades creating play {{of light and shadow}} is pure Baroque. However, when a few years later the upper floor was added, despite the use of Baroque broken pediments above the windows, the neoclassical French influence is very pronounced, highlighted by the central curved bay. The Sicilian Baroque was gradually and slowly being superseded by French neoclassicism.|$|E
5|$|Both {{halves of}} the road trace their origins to the <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Aspen's {{settlement}} in the 1880s during the Colorado Silver Boom.

They began crossing what was then known as Hunter Pass, in defiance of an order from Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin {{not to do so}} until the federal government had negotiated a peace treaty with the Ute people.|$|E

5|$|Bridging the {{age when}} gods lived alone and {{the age when}} divine {{interference}} in human affairs was limited was a transitional age in which gods and mortals moved together. These were the <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the world when the groups mingled more freely than they did later. Most of these tales were later told by Ovid's Metamorphoses and they are often divided into two thematic groups: tales of love, and tales of punishment.|$|E
5|$|By 1959, the 559th had 6,000 {{personnel}} in two regiments alone, the 70th and 71st, not including combat troops in security roles or North Vietnamese and Laotian civilian laborers.

5|$|By the 1880s, punishments also {{included}} a restricted diet of bread and water (for a short time span), time in irons, and a lengthening of a prisoner's sentence by a visiting magistrate.
