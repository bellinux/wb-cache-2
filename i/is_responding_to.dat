Rachel is {{reluctant}} to start without Quinn, who has driven home {{to pick up her}} bridesmaid's dress, and texts Quinn to find out where she is.

5|$|Quinn advises Rachel {{to refuse}} Finn's {{marriage}} proposal {{and leave her}} past behind. Quinn has done so, {{and she has been}} accepted at Yale. Quinn asks to allow her to rejoin the Cheerios, but Sue refuses. However, following Regionals, she changes her mind. Quinn also changes her mind about Finn and Rachel's marriage and supports it. Rachel is reluctant to start the subsequent wedding without Quinn, and texts Quinn. Quinn <b>is</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> Rachel's text when a truck crashes into the driver's side of her car.|$|E
5|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms, the interaction between them and their environment. An organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and biotic factors as well as local abiotic factors (non-living) such as climate and ecology. One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium responding to a local sugar gradient <b>is</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.|$|E

30|$|We use {{the word}} “dominate” as a short-cut. To be more precise, optimizers “foresee” a future income {{increase}}.

25|$|A {{thorough}} {{history is}} always taken, including signalment (age, sex, breed), recent activity, diet and recent dietary changes, anthelmintic history, if {{the horse is}} a cribber, fecal quality {{and when it was}} last passed, and any history of colic. The most important factor is time elapsed since onset of clinical signs, as this has a profound impact on prognosis. Additionally, a veterinarian will need to know any drugs given to the horse, their amount, and the time they were given, as those can help with the assessment of the colic progression and how it <b>is</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> analgesia.|$|E

50|$|The Kāvyālaṃkāra has, however, {{been widely}} {{recognised}} as similar to {{and in many}} ways in disagreement with the Kāvyādarśa by Daṇḍin. Although modern scholars have debated which scholar was borrowing from which, or who <b>was</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> whom, recent work suggests that Bhāmaha was the earlier scholar, and that Daṇḍin <b>was</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> him. 'This would place Bhāmaha no later than the early 600s'.|$|R
25|$|Having {{received}} the first TCR/CD3 signal, the naïve T cell must activate a second independent biochemical pathway, known as Signal 2. This verification step is a protective measure {{to ensure that}} a T cell <b>is</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> a foreign antigen. If this second signal is not present during initial antigen exposure, the T cell presumes that it is auto-reactive. This results in the cell becoming anergic (anergy is generated from the unprotected biochemical changes of Signal 1). Anergic cells will not respond to any antigen in the future, even if both signals are present later on. These cells are generally believed to circulate throughout the body with no value until they undergo apoptosis.|$|E
2500|$|According to Pesci, {{improvisation}} and ad-libbing {{came out}} of rehearsals wherein Scorsese let the actors do whatever they wanted. He made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines the actors {{came up with that}} he liked best, and put them into a revised script that the cast worked from during principal photography. For example, the scene where Tommy tells a story and Henry <b>is</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> him — the [...] "Funny how? Do I amuse you?" [...] scene — is based on an actual event that happened to Pesci. It was worked on in rehearsals where he and Liotta improvised, and Scorsese recorded four to five takes, rewrote their dialogue, and inserted it into the script. The dinner scene with Tommy's mother was largely improvised. Her painting of the bearded man with the dogs was based on a photograph from National Geographic magazine. The cast did not meet Henry Hill during the film's shoot until a few weeks before it premiered. Liotta met him in an undisclosed city; Hill had seen the film and told the actor that he loved it.|$|E
2500|$|Scorsese {{wanted to}} depict the film's {{violence}} realistically, [...] "cold, unfeeling and horrible. Almost incidental". However, he had to remove 10 frames of blood to ensure an R rating from the MPAA. With a budget of $25 million, Goodfellas was Scorsese's most expensive film to date but still only a medium budget by Hollywood standards. It {{was also the first}} time he was obliged by Warner Bros. to preview the film. It was shown twice in California, and a lot of audiences were [...] "agitated" [...] by Henry's last day as a wise guy sequence. Scorsese argued that that was the point of the scene. Scorsese and the film's editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, made this sequence faster with more jump cuts to convey Henry's drug-addled point of view. In the first test screening there were 40 walkouts in the first ten minutes. One of the favorite scenes for test audiences was the one where Tommy tells the story and Henry <b>is</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> him—the [...] "Do I amuse you?" [...] scene.|$|E

2500|$|The EMD is {{generally}} {{also responsible for}} providing information support to the responding resources. [...] This may include callbacks to the call originator to clarify information. [...] It may involve clarifying {{the exact location of}} the patient, or sending a bystander to meet the ambulance and direct paramedics to the patient. It may also include requests from the EMS crew to provide support resources, such as additional ambulances, rescue equipment, or a helicopter. [...] The EMD also {{plays a key role in}} the safety of EMS staff. [...] They are the first with the opportunity to assess the situation that the crew <b>is</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to,</b> will maintain contact on the scene in order to monitor crew safety, and are frequently responsible for requesting emergency police response to 'back up' paramedics when they encounter a violent situation. [...] EMDs are often responsible for monitoring the status of local hospitals, advising paramedics on which hospitals are accepting ambulance patients, and which are on 're-direct' or 'divert'. In many cases, the EMD may be responsible for notifying the hospital of incoming patients on behalf of the response resource crew. [...] Paramedics who are working on patients or driving an ambulance are rarely able to make a detailed telephone call. [...] As a result, the EMD will relay any advance notification regarding patient situation or status, once in transit.|$|E
2500|$|Shakespeare {{and other}} great writers would {{reference}} {{each other and}} each other's works in their own writing. [...] According to Felicia Jean Steele, Shakespeare uses Petrarchan imagery while actually undermining {{it at the same}} time. Stephen Booth would agree that Shakespeare references Petrarchan works however, Booth says that Shakespeare [...] "gently mocks the thoughtless mechanical application of the standard Petrarchan metaphors." [...] Felicia Steele and Stephen Booth agree that there is some referencing going on, they vary slightly in the degree of Shakespeare's mockery. [...] Steele feels much stronger about the degree in which Shakespeare is discounting Petrarchan ideas by observing that in 14 lines of Sonnet 130, [...] "Shakespeare seems to undo, discount, or invalidate nearly every Petrarchan conceit about feminine beauty employed by his fellow sonneteers." [...] The final couplet is designed to undo the damage Shakespeare has done to his reader's faith that he indeed loves his [...] "dusky mistress." [...] Steele's article offers Stephen Booth's paraphrasing of the couplet: [...] "I think that my love is as rare as any woman belied by false compare." [...] Helen Vendler, who is also referenced in Steele's article states that the final couplet would read; [...] "In all, by heaven, I think my love as rare/ As any she conceived for compare." [...] All three of these authors; Steele, Booth, and Vendler believe that in this couplet, Shakespeare <b>is</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> Petrarchan imagery because other sonneteers actively misrepresent, or [...] "belie" [...] their mistress' beauty.|$|E
