5|$|Andrew II {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to occupy the}} neighboring Principality of Halych. His son, Béla, persuaded a group of Cumans to accept AndrewII's suzerainty in 1228 and established a new march in Oltenia (known as the Banate of Szörény) in 1231. Béla IV succeeded his father in 1235. <b>His</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> reacquire crown lands alienated by his predecessors created a deep rift between the monarch and the lords just as the Mongols were sweeping westward across the Eurasian steppes.|$|E
5|$|Back in Europe, Bernard of Clairvaux was humiliated by the defeat. Bernard {{considered}} it {{his duty to}} send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted {{in the second part}} of his Book of Consideration.

When <b>his</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether. He would die in 1153.|$|E

5|$|His {{work on the}} Newtonian limit, {{particularly}} in relation to cosmological solutions, led Ehlers, together with his former doctoral student Thomas Buchert, to a systematic study of perturbations and inhomogeneities in a Newtonian cosmos. This {{laid the groundwork for}} Buchert's later generalization of this treatment of inhomogeneities. This generalization was the basis of <b>his</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> explain what is currently seen as the cosmic effects of a cosmological constant or, in modern parlance, dark energy, as a non-linear consequence of inhomogeneities in general-relativistic cosmology.|$|E

5|$|Pope Innocent, who had proclaimed a new crusade in 1213, {{wanted to}} persuade Leo {{to assist the}} crusaders.

During the same period, Bohemond's position weakened. <b>His</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> take vengeance on the Assassins {{for the murder of}} his eldest son, Raymond, brought him into conflict with his old ally, Az-Zahir Ghazi of Aleppo.|$|E

5|$|Abel Starkey (died September 28, 1827) was {{a convicted}} {{counterfeiter}} whose death is {{closely tied to}} Old Newgate Prison after fatally falling during an escape attempt {{the night before the}} close of the prison. Starkey was from Roxbury, Massachusetts and became a counterfeiter. Members of a counterfeiting ring had eluded authorities for years, but they finally discovered the secret third attic of a lightning splitter home. Starkey was arrested, tried and convicted of counterfeiting. He was sentenced to a term of twenty years in the prison, where he would amass a sum of money. <b>His</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> escape ended in his death, accounts of Starkey's attempt continued to be popular in reference to the prison's history.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten years}} as the vicar, Wheelwright was {{suspended}} in 1633 following <b>his</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> sell his Bilsby ministry back to its patron to get funds to travel to New England. Instead of procuring the necessary funds, {{he was convicted of}} simony (selling church offices), and completely removed from his office. After his removal from Bilsby he was likely in Laceby in June 1633 where his daughter Elizabeth was baptized. He then preached for a short while at Belleau, Lincolnshire, but was soon silenced by the Anglican authorities for his Puritan opinions, and began making plans for his emigration from England. Wheelwright left England in 1636 with his second wife, her mother Susanna Hutchinson, and his five living children.|$|E
5|$|As part of <b>his</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> {{balance the}} budget, Corzine {{decreased}} funding to most programs and localities including state universities and colleges. The {{first of these}} decreases came with the 2007 budget. Rutgers University and other New Jersey state universities have raised tuition, cut hundreds of sections of classes, and several sports teams. With the latest decrease in funding for 2009, most state institutions have less funding than they had a decade ago. Despite the $15 million in cuts, Rutgers went ahead with previous agreed upon raises of $15 million to their executive faculty. This resulted in Rutgers making $30 million in cuts.|$|E

5|$|Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD) was {{a philosopher}} and theologian born in Roman Africa (present-day Algeria). He {{followed}} the Manichaean religion during his early life, but converted to Christianity in 386. His two major works, Confessions and City of God, develop key ideas regarding {{his response to}} suffering. In Confessions, Augustine wrote that his previous work was dominated by materialism and that reading Plato's works enabled him to consider {{the existence of a}} non-physical substance. This helped him develop a response to the problem of evil from a theological (and non-Manichean) perspective, based on his interpretation of the first few chapters of Genesis and the writings of Paul the Apostle. In City of God, Augustine developed his theodicy as part of <b>his</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> trace human history and describe its conclusion.|$|E

Zorin identifies Bond as an agent, has May Day assassinate Tibbett, and believes that <b>his</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> assassinate Bond has been successful. Afterwards, General Gogol of the KGB confronts Zorin for killing Bond without permission and reveals that Zorin was initially trained and financed by the KGB but has now gone rogue. Later, Zorin unveils to a group of investors his plan to destroy Silicon Valley which will give him—and the potential investors—a monopoly over the microchip industry.|$|E
5|$|By 1210, Michael {{was secure}} enough {{to launch an}} attack against the Latin Kingdom of Thessalonica, in {{conjunction}} with the Bulgarians. Repelled by the intervention of the Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders, Michael quickly switched sides and joined the Latins to prevent the city from falling into Bulgarian hands. In 1212, he conquered most of Thessaly from the Lombard lords of Thessalonica. At about the same time, his troops briefly took over the Lordship of Salona. He then went on to recover Dyrrhachium and the island of Corfu from the Venetians in 1213–14, but was thwarted in <b>his</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> push further north into Zeta. He was assassinated soon after in his sleep, and was succeeded by his half-brother Theodore Komnenos Doukas.|$|E
