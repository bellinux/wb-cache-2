5|$|After much speculation, Manning {{announced}} in the offseason that he would return for his 18th season in the NFL. In the season opener against the Baltimore Ravens, Manning's play seemed to have deteriorated, going 24–40 for 175 yards and one interception, but a pick-6 by cornerback Aqib Talib allowed the Broncos to win 19–13. The Broncos {{got off to a}} dominant 7–0 start to the season; however, the streak ended in a loss at Indianapolis, losing 24–27. During that winning streak, and the loss in Indianapolis, Manning played better, putting up over 250 yards <b>in</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> the seven games, and he scored nine touchdowns. However, he never had a game without an interception, bringing his 8-game TD–INT ratio to 9–13, and the Broncos needed a hardworking defense to contribute for victories.|$|E
5|$|By {{now in his}} mid thirties, {{first team}} {{opportunities}} became scarce for Gibbs in 2000–01. He made only seven first team appearances, although Watford managed to avoid defeat <b>in</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> those. His final appearance, and only game under Gianluca Vialli, came on 24 April 2002. An 82nd-minute substitute, Gibbs was unable to prevent a late Gillingham goal, which secured them a 3–2 victory. Among Gillingham's players for Gibbs' professional swansong was Andy Hessenthaler, the man who became Watford captain after Gibbs' injury. Gibbs retired as Watford's second highest all-time appearance maker, although he started more matches than Luther Blissett, the man ahead of him.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood next {{turned his}} {{attention}} towards Breezy (1973), a film about love blossoming between a middle-aged man and a teenage girl. During casting for the film Eastwood met Sondra Locke for the first time, an actress who would play major roles <b>in</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> his films {{over the next ten}} years and would become an important figure in his life. Kay Lenz got the part of Breezy because Locke, at age 29, was considered too old. The film, shot very quickly and efficiently by Eastwood and Frank Stanley, came in $1million under budget and was finished three days ahead of schedule. Breezy was not a major critical or commercial success and it was only made available on video in 1998.|$|E

5|$|England {{opened the}} year of 1966 on 5 January with a 1–1 draw with Poland at Goodison Park; Ramsey's {{managerial}} ability was demonstrated during the game as the equalising goal came from Bobby Moore, who was allowed to surge forward as Charlton covered the gap he left behind in defence. Charlton played <b>in</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> the next seven international victories as England prepared for the World Cup. The run started with impressive victories over West Germany and then Scotland in front of 133,000 fans at Hampden Park. He scored his first international goal with a deflected shot on 26 June, as England recorded a 3–0 victory over Finland at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium. He missed the match against Norway but returned to action with a headed goal in a 2–0 win over Denmark at Idrætsparken.|$|E
5|$|Kartik {{was thus}} {{selected}} in the Indian ODI team for the home summer, and played in ten of the twelve ODIs that India hosted in late 2005. He started well with 3/48 in a 152-run crushing of Sri Lanka in Nagpur, {{and went on to}} finish the series with eight wickets at 30.25, playing <b>in</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> the seven matches. However, his form dissipated and he went wicketless in the South African series, conceding 126 runs in 28 overs, and giving away more than a run a ball in the last two matches. Kumble remained in favour for the Tests along with Harbhajan, and Kartik returned to Ranji competition while they bowled against Sri Lanka in the five-dayers. Kartik took 5/95 against Mumbai and then 8/40 against Delhi, and in three Ranji Trophy matches took 17 wickets at 19.94.|$|E
5|$|McCarty {{remained}} in a multi-purpose role in 2010 and was utilized {{more frequently in}} the passing game compared to the previous season. He made a reception for a first down following a fake punt in Week 6. He missed two games {{later in the season}} due to a hand injury. In a September 26 game against the Toronto Argonauts, McCarty rushed for 84 yards on 10 carries and two fourth-quarter touchdowns, including a 46-yard breakaway. McCarty was utilized about equally on the ground and in the air, ending his season with 287 rushing yards on 62 carries and 278 receiving yards on 36 catches as well as five total touchdowns. He continued to play on the special teams where he made eight tackles. He started <b>in</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> the 15 games he played, and the Eskimos nominated him for Most Outstanding Canadian.|$|E

5|$|Short track {{speed skating}} has {{provided}} the country with many firsts. Australia won its first World Championships in a winter sport when their relay team won the 5,000m race in 1991, which was hosted in Sydney. However, they crashed at the 1992 Olympics when the discipline was introduced and failed to win a medal, {{and all of the}} individual competitors finished in {{the bottom half of the}} field. They recovered to post a series of strong performances in Lillehammer in 1994. The short track relay yielded Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze. The Australians also did well individually; all four representatives finished in the top 13 in at least one of their races, and in the top half <b>in</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> their eight events, including top-ten finishes for Steven Bradbury and Richard Nizielski.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Harris {{to injury}} after the twelfth {{game of the}} season coincided with a decline in {{defensive}} performance. Before his loss, the Bears allowed only two opponents to score more than twenty points (23 points to the Arizona Cardinals in week six and 31 to the Miami Dolphins in week 9). After his injury, Chicago opponents scored more than 20 points <b>in</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> the seven remaining games, including two of three playoff games. Only the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship game were held below 21 points.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also an}} {{indeterminate}} {{relationship between}} the figures in the spandrels and the lunettes beneath them.

Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with shears trimming the neck of a garment she is making while her toddler looks on. The Biblical woman who is recorded as making a new garment for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went to live in the temple, and indeed, the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive hat that might suggest that of a priest. The other figure who differs from the rest is a young woman who sits staring out of the picture with prophetic intensity. Her open eyes have been closed in the restoration.|$|E

5|$|As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was {{eligible}} {{to play for}} the national team of both countries. Selectors for Spain's Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona's director of football, Carles Rexach, alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent La Albiceleste since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8–0 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute <b>in</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> the nine games, proving more effective when coming on in the second half. After being named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2–1 goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the FIFA World Youth Championship.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of his career Rodman was known for his defensive hustle, which was later accompanied by his rebounding prowess. In Detroit, he was mainly played as a small forward, and his usual assignment was to neutralize the opponent's best player; Rodman was so versatile that he could guard centers, forwards, or guards equally well and won two NBA Defensive Player of the Year Awards. From 1991 on, he established himself {{as one of the best}} rebounders of all time, averaging at least 15 rebounds per game <b>in</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> the next seven years. Playing power forward as member of the Spurs and the Bulls, he had a historical outburst in the 1996 NBA Finals: he twice snared 11 offensive rebounds, equalling an all-time NBA record. In addition, he had a career-high 34-rebound game on March 4, 1992. Rodman's rebounding prowess with Detroit and San Antonio was also aided by his decreased attention to defensive positioning and helping teammates on defense. Daly said Rodman was selfish about rebounding, but deemed him a hard worker and coachable. Rodman's defensive intensity returned while with Chicago.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Bajana {{returned}} to the Somerset team, playing <b>in</b> <b>six</b> <b>of</b> their twelve County Championship matches. His batting average of 27.55 in that competition was the second-highest amongst his team, bettered only by Jack MacBryan. Bajana hit two half-centuries during the season, scoring 77 against Derbyshire, and 59 against Essex. The following 1920 season was Bajana's last with Somerset. He appeared fifteen times for the county in first-class cricket, averaging just over twenty. In a match against Cambridge University, he achieved his highest first-class score, hitting 14 fours {{on his way to}} a total of 115 runs in 135 minutes. In his next match, he scored a second century for Somerset, and his only one in the County Championship, scoring 106 runs against Warwickshire. Bajana played his final first-class match against Middlesex in August 1920, scoring six and a duck. In all, Bajana scored 1,975 first-class runs at an average of 20.78. He scored three centuries and seven half-centuries in 96 innings. He was rarely used as a bowler, and took four wickets at an average of 33.00.|$|E
