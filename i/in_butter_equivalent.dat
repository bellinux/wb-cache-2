The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the structure modification of palm oil to cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalent</b> using Carica papaya lipase –catalyzed interesterification. The study showed that the compositions of cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalent</b> were affected by acyl donor sources, substrate ratio, initial water of enzyme, reaction time, reaction temperature and the amount of enzyme. Among three acyl donors tested (methyl stearate, ethyl stearate and stearic acid), methyl stearate appeared to be the best acyl donor for incorporation to palm oil structure. The best reaction conditions for cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalent</b> production were: substrate ratio (palm oil: methyl stearate, mol/mol) at 1 : 4, water activity of enzyme at 0. 11, reaction time at 4 h, reaction temperature at 45 � C and 18 % by weight of the enzyme. The chemical and physical properties of cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalent</b> were 9. 75 ± 0. 41 % free fatty acid, 44. 89 ± 0. 84 iodine number, 193. 19 ± 0. 78 sponification value and melting point at 37 - 39 � C.

Characterisation of high 1, 3 -distearoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycerol content stearins produced by acidolysis of high oleic sunflower oil with stearic and palmitic acids. European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology, 116 (5), pp. 532 - 547, which has been published in final form at [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving. Nine different stearin fractions with 1, 3 -distearoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycerol (StOSt) contents ranging from 69 – 84 % were obtained via fractionation from fats produced by acidolysis of high oleic sunflower oil (HOSO) with various mixtures of stearic (either 95 or 98 % pure) and palmitic acids (98 % pure). Samples were further treated with silica to reduce the oxidised glyceride and DAG content. Isothermal crystallisation at 20 °C showed a single main peak, but evidence of crystallisation during the initial DSC transient was also apparent for high StOSt content samples. This was confirmed as the α form by stop-and-return DSC and XRD. The main crystallisation event was generally faster (including a shorter induction time) for samples with higher StOSt levels (lower POSt levels). Silica treatment generally accelerated transformations to higher polymorphs (γ, β′ and β). Raman microscopy experiments showed that crystallisation of the β-form was achieved after 7 days storage at 20 °C but only in the silica treated stearin samples. This is consistent with higher solid fat content (SFC) values that were obtained with silica treated samples, which also increased with higher levels of StOSt. The results suggest that such stearins could potentially replace shea stearin <b>in</b> cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalents</b> (CBE) formulations...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} approach for {{the determination of}} milk fat and cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalents</b> <b>in</b> milk chocolate is presented. By performing a single triacylglycerol analysis using gas liquid chromatography several useful pieces of information can be determined, i. e., (i) the milk fat content of the chocolate sample, (ii) the contribution of triacylglycerols originating from milk fat, (iii) the presence/absence of cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalents,</b> and (iv) the amount of vegetable fat present in milk chocolate. The elaborated approach was collaboratively tested, thus proving its validity {{to be used by}} control laboratories to asses correct labelling of milk chocolate according to Directive 2000 / 36 /EC [1].

The influence of reaction parameters such as substrate mole ratio, reaction temperature, enzyme load, water content and reaction time were studied. Two stages of solvent fractionation were followed after enzymatic acidolysis to produce cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalent.</b> TAG contents of the reaction products were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography. The best results (12. 85 % POP, 37. 60 % POS and 15. 30 SOS) was obtained at 1 : 7 (OOO:palmitic-stearic acid) substrate mole ratio, and reaction parameters: time 6 h, temperature 70 °C, enzyme load 10 %, water content 1 %.

40|$|The {{detection}} of vegetable fats added to coca <b>butters</b> <b>in</b> chocolateformulations {{was investigated in}} model mixtures. Cocoa butters varying inorigins, crop and treatment were analysed alone and combined at levels of 5, 10, 15 or 20 % {{to a variety of}} cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalents.</b> Triglyceride profiles were obtained by high resolution GC. The areas of the major triglycerides present were plotted one vs. the other. The plots percentages of specific triglycerides showed the capabilityto detect vegetable fats added to cocoa <b>butters</b> <b>in</b> these model systems, and quantification of the addition could be done down to a 5 % level on a cocoa butter basis. The detection was most difficult {{in the case of the}} addition of illipe fat and the quantification could not be done below 10 %. The results suggest that in chocolate, which contains 20 - 25 % cocoabutter, this detection system is able to reach down to 1 - 2 %, thus well below the proposed 5 % regulatory level. JRC.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increased}} interest <b>in</b> cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>equivalent</b> (CBE) {{due to high}} price, uncertainty in supply and variability in quality of authentic cocoa butter (CB). This study investigated the blending of hard palm oil midfraction (PMF) with canola oil to produce CBEs which contain omega- 3 and omega- 6 fatty acids using immobilized lipase from Rhizomucor miehei. The experiments were designed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to optimize the percentage of triacylgycerols (TAGs) including palmitic-oleic-palmitic (POP), palmitic-oleic-stearic (POS), stearic-oleic-stearic (SOS) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The experiment was performed at hard PMF concentration of 50 to 90 %, lipozyme load between 5 % and 10 % with reaction time of 2 to 14 hours. The best reaction conditions to attain these targets were 58. 85 % of hard PMF concentration, 2 hours of reaction time and 7. 29 % of lipozyme load (based on the weight of substrate). Under these conditions, the produced CBE contained 28. 65 ± 2. 00 % of POP, 19. 52 ± 0. 96 % of POS, 3. 57 ± 0. 11 % of SOS and 4. 81 ± 0. 47 % of DAG. The addition of canola oil improved the nutritional value of CBEs which was marked by the higher percentage of linoleic acid (omega- 6, 7. 98 ± 0. 92 %) and linolenic acid (omega- 3, 2. 47 ± 0. 47 %) in CBE than commercially available CBE (omega- 6, 2. 63 ± 1. 01 %) and CB (omega- 6, 2. 68 ± 0. 34 %). Enzymatic interesterification has not altered fatty acid content in the CBE, especially linoleic acid (omega- 6) and linolenic acid (omega- 3) which was characterised by no significant difference (p > 0. 05) between the fatty acid profile of initial mixture and CBE. Slip melting point (SMP) value of CBE (46. 25 °C) was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) than the SMP value of CB (32 - 35 °C). In addition, the solid fat content (SFC) value of CBE was different from CB. It {{was due to the}} high amount of POP, free fatty acid (FFA) or saturated-saturated-saturated (StStSt) type of TAGs in CBE produced and also lower amount of TAGs which has oleic acid at sn- 2 position. Moreover, the produced CBE behaved as pseudoplastic flow. Although there were differences of characteristics between the produced CBE with the authentic CB, it was possible to produce a high nutritional value of CBE with a physicochemical composition that was very close to that of CB by using enzymatic interesterification...|$|R
