5|$|At about 11pm, the rioters {{arrived at}} the house of the Reverend John Vachell, who, after {{threatening}} to shoot anyone who entered his house, was disarmed when threemen rushed him. He fled on foot with <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> daughters towards Ely. After Vachell had left, the rioters destroyed his goods and chattels and stole some of his silverware. Vachell was later to sue the Hundred of Ely for the damages under the Riot Act. He received over £708 (£), an award which was challenged in the press, as many people complained {{about the size of the}} resulting district levies used to pay for it. The rioters then stopped a post-chaise returning with Hugh Robert Evans senior and Henry Martin from a Turnpike Trust meeting in Downham. They robbed Evans of 14shillings (£) before allowing them both to proceed. On reaching Ely, Evans alerted the magistrates who sent a carriage for Reverend Vachell, which collected him and his family walking towards Ely.|$|E
