40|$|Furrow or {{sprinkler}} irrigation {{is often used}} to enhance sug-arbeet (Beta vulgaris) plant establishment, yet little infor-mation is available comparing the two methods. Furrow irrigation saturates the seedbed from the bottom up, leaving the soil surface undisturbed.

The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model {{contains}} a <b>furrow</b> <b>irrigation</b> component to simulate hydrology and erosion in <b>irrigation</b> <b>furrows.</b> It currently {{is the only}} multiple-event furrow erosion simulation model available for public use. However, the <b>furrow</b> <b>irrigation</b> component has not been evaluated yet. Therefore, we evaluated the WEPP model for <b>furrow</b> <b>irrigation</b> by comparing predicted infiltration, runoff, and soil loss with field measurements from three southern Idaho studies on Portneuf silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplocalcids). Baseline effective hydraulic conductivity, rill erodibility, and critical shear were calibrated using data measured from the upper quarter of two fields. Calibrated effective hydraulic conductivity was {{within the range of}} WEPP-defined values for Portneuf soil. Calibrated rill erodibility of 0. 0003 s m- 1 was almost two orders of magnitude less than the WEPP-defined value of 0. 02 s m- 1, while calibrated critical shear of 1. 2 Pa was about one-third of the WEPP-defined value of 3. 5 Pa. Predicted infiltration correlated poorly with measured infiltration for most fields. Regression coefficients for predicted versus measured infiltration ranged from- 0. 07 to 0. 35, indicating that predicted infiltration did not vary with measured infiltration. Predicted soil loss correlated well (R 2 = 0. 57) with measured soil loss from {{the upper end of the}} two fields used to calibrate erodibility parameters. At the field ends however; runoff was underpredicted and soil loss was overpredicted. When runoff was predicted reasonably well for an irrigation, cumulated predicted soil erosion across a field did not match cumulated measured erosion at field quarter segments because transport capacity was overpredicted. Deposition was not predicted unless runoff was greatly under-predicted.

40|$|Slumping of hardsetting seedbeds upon wetting {{is likely}} to {{determine}} the shrinking and development of strength on drying. Different processes have been invoked, including aggregate disruption, material relocation, and compaction. To {{gain a better understanding}} of the role played by compaction compared with aggregate disruption in seedbed slumping and shrinking, mechanical analysis was combined with previous morphogenetical description. The global structural behavior of repacked seedbeds of a hardsetting sandy loam soil was studied after wetting and again after subsequent drying. Bulk density was measured in 5 -mm-depth increments using gamma attenuation, and water content was determined at 10 -mm-depth increments. Various wetting conditions were used to simulate a range of climatic and management conditions, including flood <b>irrigation,</b> <b>furrow</b> irrigation of a formed seedbed, drip irrigation, and rainfall. Aggregate coalescence under overburden pressure played the main role in slumping, even though microcracking enhanced coalescence. Most of the slumping occurred at calculated effective stress > 1. 1 kPa. Intense aggregate breakdown at the top of seedbeds under fast wetting led to slight slumping because the resulting clogging of the initial interaggregate packing voids was balanced, in part, by the increase in microporosity resulting from aggregate disruption. However, aggregate coalescence induced by overburden pressure developing at the seedbed bottom often resulted in a strong decrease in total porosity. The effect of rainfall kinetic energy on crust bulk density was strong compared with the effect of fast wetting (bulk density increase of about 0. 07 Mg m(- 3) and 0. 03 Mg m(- 3), respectively) and could be ascribed to compaction rather than to aggregate breakdown. Shrinking on drying was related to the continuity of the microstructure resulting from wetting rather than to the intensity of slumping. Aggregate breakdown led to more shrinking than did aggregate coalescence...|$|E
40|$|This {{bulletin}} reports experimental {{procedure and}} data {{collected in a}} three-year study {{of the effect of}} <b>irrigation</b> <b>furrow</b> slopes and size of streams on the amounts of soil eroded from the furrows. Studies were made in 10 furrows on each of two farm experimental plots, the furrows being in different directions from a central water-stilling basin. The experimental plots were maintained fallow during the season [...] no crops were grown. Furrow slopes ranged from less than 1 percent to slightly more than 6 percent. Irrigation streams from 5 to 30 gallons per minute at the furrow inlet were measured first by means of triangular weirs and later with circular orifices. Five complete field experimental runs were made on the Forage Experimental Farm soil near Logan, and 6 runs were made on the sandy loam soil of the State Prison Farm about 20 miles south of Salt Lake City. The weight of water-free soil eroded in one hour from 200 -foot furrows ranged from only a few pounds in a furrow of less than 1 percent slope to more than 1800 pounds in a furrow of 6 percent slope. Laboratory experiments were made by use of a 32 -foot length, 5 -channel wooden structure supported on a fulcrum near the middle and on hydraulic jacks at each end to permit adjustment of furrow slopes. Three different soils were used in the laboratory, the Forage Experimental Farm loam, a Box Elder County sandy loam, and the Prison Farm sandy loam. Experiments were made with V-shaped furrows and with flat-bed furrows, using streams ranging from 5 to 15 gallons per minute in each furrow. The slopes of the laboratory furrows ranged from 0. 2 percent up to 4. 0 percent, and the weights of soil eroded in one hour from one furrow ranged from zero up to 260. 8 pounds...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{water and}} {{nitrogen}} redistribution {{in the soil}} profile is important to improve water and nitrogen use efficiency for sustainable agriculture. This thesis evaluates the interactions between water and fertiliser management factors affecting water and nitrogen use efficiency, based on field experiments on a semi-arid loamy sandy soil. The impact on maize (Zea mays L.) yield and other crop properties was also assessed. Cropping periods in two hot-wet seasons and two cold-dry seasons were compared. The treatments involved two irrigation methods (furrow and drip), two irrigation levels (full and reduced) and two top dressing nitrogen fertiliser types (quick-release and slow-release). Overall, there were trends for better nitrogen uptake, water and nitrogen use efficiency and grain yield in the cold-dry than in the hot-wet season, especially under reduced <b>irrigation.</b> <b>Furrow</b> irrigation with reduced irrigation level tended to give higher grain and dry matter nitrogen use efficiency in both hot-wet and cold-dry cropping periods. Soil moisture distribution, water flow direction and deep percolation were primarily affected by irrigation method and irrigation level in the cold-dry season and by a combined effect of irrigation level and rainfall events in the hot-wet season. In both seasons, full irrigation level with quick-release nitrogen fertiliser was found to induce more net downward redistribution of water and nitrogen in the soil profile, irrespective of irrigation method. Reduced irrigation, particularly in the hot-wet season, resulted in less deep percolation. In the cold-dry cropping period, reduced irrigation combined with slow-release nitrogen fertiliser, resulted in longer nitrogen residence time at 30 and 60 cm depth, irrespective of irrigation method. Drip irrigation resulted in a moister soil profile overall in both seasons, and thus allowed better growth and elongation of coarse and fine roots, which were denser in the uppermost 56 cm of soil and reached a maximum depth of 80 cm. These results indicate that reduced irrigation {{should be considered as}} a potential irrigation management option for semi-arid loamy sandy soil in both hot-wet and cold-dry seasons. Drip irrigation and slow-release nitrogen fertiliser may be suitable options for the cold-dry season...|$|E

The overall objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of subsurface drip <b>irrigation</b> (SDI) and <b>furrow</b> <b>irrigation</b> on onion yield and irrigation use efficiency. This study was conducted in two locations, a commercial field and a field located at the Texas A&M AgriLife Research Center in Weslaco, TX. This study was conducted as a split-plot design for both sites with two treatments (SDI and <b>furrow</b> <b>irrigation)</b> and three replications per treatment. The total onion yield obtained with the SDI systems was more than 93 % higher than the yield obtained with <b>furrow</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems. The large onion size was 181 % higher for the SDI system than the furrow system in both sites. The colossal size yield was also higher. At one site colossal yield was 206 % higher than furrow, while at another site furrow yielded no colossal onions and SDI had some production. It was concluded that drip irrigation systems more than double yields and increased onion size while using almost half of the water. This was due to SDI allowing for more frequent and smaller irrigation depths with higher <b>irrigation</b> efficiency than <b>furrow</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|Equations {{of motion}} {{describing}} flow in <b>irrigation</b> <b>furrows</b> are derived and presented in characteristic form. Predicted flow profiles obtained from approximate numerical solutions of the {{equations of motion}} did not compare well with measured flow profiles. An estimate of furrow hydraulic roughness was obtained from field data. A procedure for determining infiltration rates from measurements of surface flow volume and irrigation stream advance is proposed for the case for which the cumulative infiltration is described by the KostiakovLewis equation. Numerical solutions of the steady-state form of the flow equations were used to prepare design curves providing estimates of cutback flow rates for preventing tailwater losses. Sample problems illustrate how these reduced rates of application can be utilized to design <b>furrow</b> <b>irrigation</b> distribution systems to obtain improved irrigation efficiencies and subsurface water distribution patterns...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—An {{experiment}} {{was conducted on}} the comparative study of drip and <b>furrow</b> <b>irrigation</b> methods at the farmer’s field in Umar Kot. The total area under experiment about 4000 m 2 was divided into two equal portions. One portion about 40 m X 50 m was occupied by drip and the other portion about 40 m X 50 m by <b>furrow</b> <b>irrigation</b> method. Soil at the experimental site was clay loam in texture for 0 - 60 cm depth; average dry bulk density and field capacity was 1. 16 g/cm 3 and 28. 5 % respectively. The results reveal that the drip irrigation method saved 56. 4 % water and gave 22 % more yield as compared to that of <b>furrow</b> <b>irrigation</b> method. Higher water use efficiency about 4. 87 was obtained in drip irrigation method; whereas lower water used efficiency about 1. 66 was obtained in <b>furrow</b> <b>irrigation</b> method. The present study suggests farming community to adopt drip irrigation method instead of old traditional flooding methods.
