The first {{work was}} {{to remove the}} existing Church of Saint Saviour's tenor bell, the existing (temporary) roof, and the weathered render {{to the top of}} the wall. During this work, the 1909 commemoration stone was discovered. It has always been a tenet of the consultant's work on the project that their building would resemble Edmund Blacket's original design as closely as possible. In accordance with this principal, it was decided very early that the tower/spire would be a mass masonry structure, with the concrete substructure introduced only as demanded by seismic and bell ringing loads. The mass structure employed was of face sandstone with 'through' stones as required, with a mass brickwork backing making up the rest of the wall. This <b>dry</b> <b>press</b> brickwork was to be laid integrally with the stonework in garden bond.|$|E
40|$|This article {{reports the}} impacts of three {{different}} drying treatments on selected physical and mechanical properties of European (Populus tremula L.) and hybrid (P. tremula × tremuloides) aspen wood. The material originates from 5 European aspen stands and 7 hybrid aspen stands in southern and central Finland. After processing the logs at a saw mill, sawn timber samples were dried using 1) conventional warm air <b>drying,</b> 2) <b>press</b> <b>drying,</b> or 3) heat treatment into Thermo-S grade by the Finnish Thermowood ® method. Finally, small clearwood specimens were manufactured from different within-stem positions for the measurements of physical and mechanical properties. Both <b>press</b> <b>dried</b> and heat treated specimens absorbed water at significantly slower pace than the conventionally dried specimens. In normal climate, the conventionally <b>dried,</b> <b>press</b> <b>dried</b> and heat treated specimens conditioned at equilibrium mois-ture contents of 12. 2, 8. 7, and 8. 9 per cent, respectively.

50|$|Many {{rural areas}} were without even {{elementary}} schools. News paper was a luxury. Malayalam weekly magazines were in great demand; people buy weekly magazine {{of their choice}} sharing the cost by contributing each one few paisa or a little more as the individual could afford. The cost of a most popular Malayalam weekly of that time was only two annas, equivalent of today’s twelve paisa per issue. There were no radio or cinema halls in easy reach. It is not that radio was not invented then; {{there was no money}} to buy one. Most of the rural people were depending on their meagre agriculture produce for sustaining. Cash crunch was very evident in the day-to-day life style of people. For many, even a shirt was a luxury. It was a custom to extend wedding invitation at least 15 days in advance so that one will have ample time to borrow a shirt from his friends; give it a good wash then get it <b>dry,</b> <b>press</b> and keep it ready for that grand occasion. In such circumstances, buying books or news papers were not in the reach of a common man. But the youths were restless; revolutionary ideas and free thoughts were spreading very fast. Atheists were looked upon as most modern by the young and most wicked by the old. In this confusion books were a solace to the young helping to drown their worries and weaving dreams and pandering in to their own imaginative romantic world. In this backdrop, wishes of many like minded persons of Muttathukonam crystallized in to forming a library. Yet an external push was required to take off the dream project. It came at last in the shape of news that govt. was considering of sanctioning one rural library in the vicinity of Elavumthitta. Many places near Elavumthitta—rivals of Muttathukonam in all healthy competitions, if come to know, will snatch it. First come first was the ‘rule of the game’ then; let us see who will get away with the library.|$|E

40|$|Ceramic materials, in {{particular}} high-performance ceramics, are the materials {{of the future}} in restorative dentistry, nevertheless, the use of all-ceramic dentures places high demands on the material, its hardness and chemical resistance. In the present work, laminated composites were prepared in the system Al 2 O 3 - ZrO 2 using the <b>dry</b> <b>press</b> and the slip casting process in gypsum molds. A liquid route was chosen for {{the preparation of the}} dispersion ceramics since very good homogenization of the ceramic particles can be achieved. For this purpose, pourable slurries were prepared from nanocrystalline Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 powders. Particular importance is attached to the optimum adjustment of the slurry. However, since the knowledge of the production of solidsrich slurry from powders with a particle size in the nanometer range is very small, the production of suitable slips proved difficult. The processing of dry powders in the press is still problematic, because it can lead to stresses and cracking in the ceramic after sintering. After the sintering process, the specimens were subjected to a few tests. The measurement of the layer thicknesses, in addition the measurement to the porosity and density of the sample bodies, as well the setting of Vickers hardness indices and the calculation of the hardness were carried out. The scanning electron microscopy and EDX examinations at the interfaces of the laminated ceramic samples showed that the compound is very compact and stable. Within the scope of this thesis it has been shown the possibility of production of hierarchically structured stable ceramic components. Layered ceramics are very promising in the search for a way to tailor “intelligent composites” to satisfy the complex requirements of dentistry. ...|$|E
