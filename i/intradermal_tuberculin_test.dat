40|$|Abstract. In the USA, {{all species}} of Cervidae are {{included}} in the USDA’s uniform methods and rules for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and, therefore, are subject to regulations regarding <b>intradermal</b> <b>tuberculin</b> <b>testing.</b> In reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), infection with Mycobacterium bovis is exceedingly rare and the re-sponse of reindeer to infection with M. bovis in pathologic and immunologic terms is unknown. The objectives of the study reported here were to describe the pathologic changes associated with M. bovis infection in reindeer and evaluate the effectiveness of <b>intradermal</b> <b>tuberculin</b> <b>testing</b> as a means of diagnosis of tuberculosis in reindeer. Thirteen reindeer were inoculated intratonsilarly with 105 colony-forming units (CFU) of M. bovis, and 4 noninoculated reindeer served as negative controls. The comparative cervical test (CCT) was done on all reindeer 90 and 240 days after inoculation. Thirteen months after inoculation, all reindeer were euthanized and examined. All experimentally inoculated reindeer developed lesions in the medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes. The CCT accurately identified all M. bovis-inoculated reindeer, but false-positive results were common among negative-control reindeer. Modifications of the method for interpretation of the CCT decreased false-positive results without increasing false-negative results. Reindeer are susceptible to infection with M. bovis; however, lesions are fewer in number, less severe in nature, and less widely disseminated than are those seen in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Comparative cervical skin testing of reindeer can be highly sensitive, but has low specificity. Specificity can be improved by modification of criteria for interpretation of the CCT.

In vitro lymphocyte proliferation assays were used to identify T-cell epitopes. Lymphocytes from experimentally infected cattle proliferated in response to five epitopes (residues 88 - 105 and 144 - 163 for MPB 70; 1 - 16 and 67 - 84 for the 19, 000 MW antigen; and 85 - 100 for MBP 57).

The current antemortem diagnostic method, the <b>intradermal</b> <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test,</b> is impractical for routine use with many wild animals. Antibody-based assays are particularly attractive because the animals are handled only once and immediate processing of the sample is not required. This report characterizes the antibody responses of red deer-elk hybrids (Cervus elaphus) against Mycobacterium bovis and subsequently evaluates the diagnostic performance of select antigens in a rapid-test format. Sequential serum samples were collected from 10 animals experimentally infected with M. bovis and 5 noninfected animals over a 7 -month period postinfection (p. i.). Samples were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, immunoblot analyses, and multiantigen print immunoassays for seroreactivity to mycobacterial antigens. Although all infected animals produced antibodies to M. bovis protein antigens, there was significant animal-to-animal variation in the kinetics and magnitudes of responses and the antigens recognized. The most frequently recognized antigens included MPB 83, ESAT- 6, CFP 10, and MPB 70. Responses to some antigens, such as MPB 83, were consistently detected as early as 4 weeks after inoculation, whereas other antigens were detected only much later (> 140 days p. i.).

For the OASIS flash tool, one full day meeting with representatives from stakeholders involved with the surveillance was organised. A total of 19 criteria linked to acceptability were scored on a scale from 0 to 3. Results and Conclusion: Both methods highlighted a medium acceptability of the bTB surveillance. The main elements having a negative influence were the consequences of official notification of a bTB suspect case in a farm, the low remuneration paid to private veterinarians for execution of <b>intradermal</b> <b>tuberculin</b> <b>tests</b> and the practical difficulties about the containment of the animals. Based on the two evaluation processes, relevant recommendations to improve the surveillance were made. Based on the comparison between the two evaluation processes, the added value of the participatory approach was highlighted. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The <b>intradermal</b> <b>tuberculin</b> <b>tests</b> and the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) assay are the {{principal}} tests used worldwide for the ante-mortem diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis. The conventional reagent currently in use in these tests is purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin obtained from Mycobacterium bovis culture. The components of PPD are poorly characterized and difficult to standardize. To overcome this issue, antigens specific to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex are being studied. Here we have assessed the biological potency of ESAT- 6, CFP- 10 and Rv- 3615 c presented as peptide or recombinant protein cocktails {{in comparison with the}} standard bovine PPD used routinely in Spanish eradication campaigns. The study was performed in cattle (n= 23) from a herd with natural M. bovis infection. Animals were simultaneously injected with PPD and the peptide and protein cocktails. The percentages of cattle reacting positively to single intradermal test were 60. 9 % (bovine PPD), 47. 8 % (peptide cocktail) and 60. 9 % (protein cocktail), with {{no significant difference between the}} actual skin fold thickness increases (p> 0. 05). The IFN-γ assay detected 60. 9 % of animals when stimulation was performed with bovine PPD, but decreased to 52. 2 % when stimulation was performed with the peptide cocktail and to 47. 8 % when stimulation was performed with the protein cocktail. However, no significant differences were found between IFN-γ responder frequencies (p> 0. 05). These results show a potential use of these defined reagents for in vivo tuberculosis diagnosis.
