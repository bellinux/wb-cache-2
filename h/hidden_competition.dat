40|$|This paper studies {{strategic}} investment {{behavior of}} firms facing an uncertain demand in a duopoly setting. Firms choose both investment timing {{and the capacity}} level while facing additional uncertainty about market participants, which is introduced via the concept of <b>hidden</b> <b>competition.</b> We focus on the analysis of possible strategies of the market leader {{in terms of its}} capacity choice and on the influence of <b>hidden</b> <b>competition</b> on these strategies. We show that due to <b>hidden</b> <b>competition</b> the follower is more eager to invest. As a result, an entry deterrence strategy of the leader becomes more costly, and it can only be implemented for smaller market size, leaving additional room for entry accommodation. The leader has incentives to prevent entry of the hidden competitor stimulating simultaneous investment if the hidden firm has a large capacity, and has more incentives to apply entry deterrence in the complementary case of a small capacity of the hidden player. In the first case overinvestment aimed to deter the follower's entry does not occur {{for a wide range of}} parameters values...|$|E

In particular, this thesis contains three studies, in which we develop continuous-time investment models under uncertainty with lumpy investment.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} governmental regulatory policies and competitive dynamics amongst private operators and the national monopolist, TP SA, in three network segments of the Polish telecommunications sector. Special {{attention is paid to}} the evolution of organizational strategies in a regulatory environment characterized by constant strategic indecision and reorientations of national policy makers. The paper finds that regulatory/competition coevolution has taken diverse forms in the three network subsegments, with asymmetric duopoly operating in the local fixed network, <b>hidden</b> <b>competition</b> at work in the long-distance fixed network, and oligopolistic technology-driven competition characterizing the high-growth cellular network. The conclusion reached is that Polish telecommunications to date has been stuck in a broad stage of pre-competitive market maneuverings by domestic and international capital, in preparation for privatization of the national operator and for full liberalization as part of EU integration.

40|$|Straipsnio tikslas – parodyti svarstymų demokratijos būklę ir jos raidos sąlygas masinės propagandos savispektaklizacijos medijų rinkos ir informacinių karų gamybos metu. Ar svarstantysis supratimas skiriasi nuo įteigtojo, nuo ideologinės interpeliacijos, nuo sutarimo inžinerijos? Straipsnis pabrėžia nuostatą apie alternatyvių pasakojimų ir polimorfizmo svarbą svarstymų demokratijai. Kita vertus, įvairovės dauginimas suteikia rinkos pranašumą prieš paprastą propagandą ir kontrpropagandą, verčia jas prisitaikyti prie masinės paklausos. Svarstymų demokratija yra skatinama skirti politinę sceną nuo politinės arenos, spektakliškų alternatyvų pasiūlą – nuo realių interesų kovos. Straipsnyje vadovaujamasi nuostata dėl pasikeitusio šiuolaikinio propagandos statuso, kai ji iš mobilizuojančio faktoriaus virto pejoratyviniu objektu, kurį kritikuojant įtvirtinama sava, ideologiškai konstruojama realybė ir sumenkinama kritiško ar kūrybinio, laisvo susitarimo galimybė. Straipsnyje vadovaujamasi Jeano Baudrillard’o trečiojo ir ketvirtojo laipsnio simu¬liacijos teorija. Vaizduojamas propagandos pašalinimo veiksmas dažniausiai yra lydimas ne tik kontrpropagandos, bet ir savispektaklizacijos – tai reiškinys, rodantis pasikeitusį masių ir minios statusą ir jos atsitolinimą nuo „kritiškų ir refleksyvių sutarimų“. Todėl tradiciniai propagandos apibūdinimai, skirti aiškinti masių indoktrinaciją, nebetinkami: šiuolaikiniams vartotojams reikia daug atnaujinamų pranešimų, kuriuos jie patys išplatina. Būtent šioje sferoje turi įsišaknyti politinės arenos ir jomis besiremianti sutarimo demokratija. Straipsnis rodo naujų sąvokų ir koncepcijų būtinumą aiškinant informacinius konfliktus ir šiuolaikinius įtikinėjimo procesus. The {{purpose of}} the article is to show the status of deliberative {{democracy}} and the conditions for its development {{in the period of}} mass propaganda, self-spectaclization, market media and production of information warfare. The paper does not discuss other contemporary political challenges for deliberative democracy, such as secret diplomacy, or politics of forcing to negotiation and recognition. These are very important questions, but the purpose is to considerate the communicative fields, arenas, scenes, related problems of the Real and simulations, propaganda and democracy. For us, important is how deliberative recognition differs from suggested understanding, or from the ideological interpellation, or from engineering of consent? The article highlights the attitude towards the importance of alternative narratives, and polymorphism of the development of deliberative democracy. Multiplication of differences creates a market advantage over a simple propaganda and counter-propaganda, and in the same time, supports development of scenes and imitations instead of supporting democratic arenas. Deliberative democracy is motivated to distinguish politics from the political arena, and simulations from the real alternatives. The article is guided by the situation of the changed status of the propaganda. Propaganda has turned from a mobilizing factor into a pejorative object, a critique which approves simulation of the real. Reasonable deliberation presumes some level of a participatory liberation. Technologies of participatory liberation are, for example, sending agitators, making provocative performances, detournement and creative rebuilding of political arenas. Participatory liberation could be based on the same issues as propaganda, it does not presuppose open, public deliberations. Scenes, the spectacles of the society need skills of consumption but not critical deliberation. Rational deliberation and consequential public consent are based on trust and credibility, on facts and researches, they differ from engineering of opinion and manufacturing of consent. Participatory emancipation is based on emotional involvement and openness, whereas propaganda – on emotional involvement and closeness. Open participatory liberation negates cynicism of hidden negotiations, provides public deliberation and involved transformation. Participatory liberation and emotional involvement help to deconstruct staging of propaganda and present real political arenas. The article emphasizes political or cultural arena as a real condensation of public interests, real conflicts of political or cultural field. Communicational modernity is characterized by <b>hidden</b> <b>competition</b> between arenas and scenes, between de-territorialized centres of attraction and territorial-administrative power; the propaganda simulation, critique and development of the alternative narratives depend on the situation...|$|E

40|$|Generally {{when there}} is {{increased}} competition {{on one side of}} the market, the other side is better off. We study the effects of increased competition among sellers {{when there is}} a potentially corrupt agent who procures the good on behalf of a buyer. The model consists of a principal (the owner of a ¯rm), an agent (the manager), and many principals" (suppliers of an input). Corruption occurs when an agent conspires with one of these hidden principals to appropriate gains at the principal's expense. Suppliers have two key attributes: production cost and " cost (a utility penalty incurred from being corrupt). The effects of increased competition among suppliers depend crucially on whether new suppliers are heterogeneous across these characteristics. When the new suppliers vary according to their productivity levels and/or their honesty levels, there are three possible sources of ine±ciency. First, no transaction may occur, although it is socially e±cient to transact. Second, the most productive supplier may not be used because he is too honest. Third, the most productive supplier may not be used because the principal has (optimally) restricted the pool of potential suppliers. Importantly, we ¯nd that increased competition among sellers may in fact harm the buyer. corruption, principal-agent, <b>hidden</b> principal, <b>competition...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{markets for}} defaultable sovereign debt in which {{even though there}} are many identical lenders and symmetric information (including no <b>hidden</b> actions), perfect <b>competition</b> does not obtain. When a private lender allows a sovereign country to increase its level of indebtedness, that lender implicitly imposes a default externality on others who have lent to that sovereign. That is, in the case where the borrower would be able to pay back the first loan {{in the absence of a}} second loan, the borrower may have a strong incentive to take both loans and default on both loans. When a lender has no control over the actions of other lenders, they must anticipate this behavior and devise a lending strategy that is consistent with the strategies not only of the sovereign borrower, but also of other lenders. We develop a model of this strategic lending behavior in the presence of default, and show that {{even though there are}} many competing lenders, the perfectly competitive outcome does not necessarily obtain. Moreover, the equilibrium can result in monopoly-like outcomes in prices and quantities. We also study the consequences of intervention in these markets by a seemingly benevolent international financia...|$|R
