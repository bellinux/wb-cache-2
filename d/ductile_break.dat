40|$|Abstract: To {{improve the}} {{mechanical}} properties of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), {{the characters of}} combining PVC with elastomers were considered. Polybutadiene grafted poly(methyl methacrylate) (PB-g-PMMA, MB) core-shell particles were prepared by emulsion polymerization, and were used as an impact modifier for PVC. The impact resistance, frac-ture, brittle-ductile transition and the morphology of PVC/MB blends were investigated. It was found that MB particles had a high toughening efficiency for PVC resin, the impact strength was more than 1100 J·m- 1 when MB was 8 phr. Two factors influence the impact strength and brittle-ductile transition, one is the modifier content, {{and the other is}} core-shell weight ratio. The impact curves are Ω-like shape, the impact strength value is the highest at the middle part and the PVC/ MB blends show <b>ductile</b> <b>break</b> behaviors. The core shell ratio of ductile areas are limited from 80 / 20 to 90 / 10 for PVC...|$|E

30|$|Analysis of the {{fracture}} curves of paired samples in Fig.  8 e, f revealed a more <b>ductile</b> <b>breaking</b> {{behavior of the}} raw sample, with two elastic and plastic domains distinguishable. The fracture was different in the thin HCl-treated sample (e), occurring sooner and indicative of the brittle nature of the material. These {{results are consistent with}} the structural modification of woody hemp observed by SEM (Fig.  8 a–d).|$|R
40|$|A 72 -year-old male patient {{underwent}} mobile-bearing posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. He {{experienced a}} nontraumatic polyethylene tibial insert cone fracture 27 months after surgery. Scanning electron microscopy of the fracture {{surface of the}} tibial insert cone suggested progress of <b>ductile</b> <b>breaking</b> from the posterior toward the anterior of the cone due to repeated longitudinal bending stress, leading to fatigue breaking at the anterior side of the cone, followed by the tibial insert cone fracture at the anterior side of the cone, resulting in fracture {{at the base of}} the cone. This analysis shows the risk of tibial insert cone fracture due to longitudinal stress in mobile-bearing posterior-stabilized total knee arthroplasty in which an insert is designed to highly conform to the femoral component...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} a new structural design procedure for the seismic retrofit interventions on reinforced concrete frame buildings with eccentric steel bracings. This work analyzes inverted-Y-braced systems, whose link {{is represented by}} an ad-hoc stiffened double-T-shaped profile. The design method here proposed works entirely in the linear range, and aims at the simultaneous plasticization of all the storey links, so as to induce a global damaging mechanism that maximizes the hysteretic damping effect. The procedure complies with the “resistance hierarchy” criterion, whereby the bracing system enters the plastic range before the existing reinforced concrete frame. It thus provides the retrofitted structure with an overall <b>ductile</b> <b>breaking</b> mechanism. Consequently, the reinforced concrete structure is lightened and less subjected to seismic action, and it is preserved from significantly entering the nonlinear field. Moreover, the introduction of eccentric steel bracings permits to regularize in plane the existing structure in order to minimize, at every level, {{the distance between the}} centroid of the masses and the center of stiffness This method has been validated by means of static and dynamic nonlinear numerical analyses both on regular and irregular frames. A practical application to an irregular frame is here described...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{mechanical}} properties of two-dimensional (2 D) boron, borophenes, by first-principles calculations. The recently synthesized borophene with 1 / 6 concentration of hollow hexagons (HH) {{is shown to}} have in-plane modulus C up to 210 N/m and bending stiffness as low as D = 0. 39 eV. Thus, its Foppl-von Karman number per unit area, defined as C/D, reaches 568 nm- 2, over twofold higher than graphene's value, establishing the borophene {{as one of the}} most flexible materials. Yet, the borophene has a specific modulus of 346 m 2 /s 2 and ideal strengths of 16 N/m, rivaling those (453 m 2 /s 2 and 34 N/m) of graphene. In particular, its structural fluxionality enabled by delocalized multi-center chemical bonding favors structural phase transitions under tension, which result in exceptionally small breaking strains yet highly <b>ductile</b> <b>breaking</b> behavior. These mechanical properties can be further tailored by varying the HH concentration, and the boron sheet without HHs can even be stiffer than graphene against tension. The record high flexibility combined with excellent elasticity in boron sheets can be utilized for designing composites and flexible systems. Comment: 13 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
30|$|PLA 4043 D is not {{for medical}} purpose, but its tensile {{strength}} and elongation at break {{are considered to be}} very close to that of PLA polymer in medical grade. Considering that polymer PLA in medical grade is far too expensive, polymer PLA 4043 D was used as an alternative in this research. Polymer PBS (RJ 503 S) was chosen in the research because it is very <b>ductile</b> (elongation at <b>break</b> ≥ 300 %) and used to overcome the brittleness of polymer PLA through blending. However, the tensile strength of PBS is limited (35 – 45  MPa), so the weight ratio in the blend should be controlled in order to achieve required mechanical strength.|$|R
40|$|The role of multistep aging on {{the stress}} {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) behavior of aluminum alloy 7010 has been investigated. The material {{in the form of}} 5 -mm-thick sheets was heat-treated to two different tempers. The heat treatments are peak-aged. obtained by a two-step aging (i. e., solution treated at 465 degreesC. water quenched at room temperature, and aged at 100 degreesC/ 8 h and 120 degreesC/ 8 h) and over-aged, obtained by a three-step aging (i. e [...] solution treated at 465 degreesC, water quenched at room temperature, and aged at 100 degreesC/ 8 h followed by 120 degreesC/ 8 h and 170 degreesC/ 8 h). SCC behavior was investigated using slow strain rate testing (SSRT) in air and 3. 5 % sodium chloride (NaCl) solution (environment). U-bend testing was carried out as a qualitative test. SSRT results show a remarkable improvement in the SCC resistance in three-step aged samples. For example, the percent reduction in area dropped from 28. 1 % (in air) to just 24. 4 % (in environment), and there was no drop in the percent elongation (similar to 10 %) when tested at a strain rate of 10 (- 6) /s. Two-step aged samples were found to be inferior compared with the three-step aged sample-the percent reduction in area of two-step aged samples dropped from 9. 9 % (in air) to 3. 3 % (in environment) and percent of elongation dropped from 10 % (in air) to 3 % (in environment). U-bend test results are also in conformity with the SSRT results, showing high resistance to SCC in the three-step aged alloy, though no direct correlation can be made. Anodic dissolution along the grain boundaries leading to intergranular cracking was evident in the SSRT and U-bend fractured specimens of the two-step aged alloy, whereas, such an attack was less prominent in the three-step aged alloy leading to a relatively more <b>ductile</b> fracture. The <b>breaking</b> of grain boundary precipitate network in the three-step aged condition could be a possible reason for better SCC resistance of the three-step aged alloy...|$|R
