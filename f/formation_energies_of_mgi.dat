For both LDA and GGA the <b>formation</b> <b>energies</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mgi</b> and Sei are relatively low in all the configurations. The most stable Se interstitial was the tetrahedral (T) configuration having lower formation energy than the decagonal (D) configuration. The Mgi and Sei defect introduced transition state levels that had either donor or acceptor levels within the band gap. Sei acts as a donor or an acceptor and creates levels that were either deep or shallow depending on the configuration. Sei exhibit negative-U properties and show charge states metastability in the D configuration. Mgi acts as only shallow donor (+ 2 / + 1) in both T and D configurations, in addition we pointed out the role of Mgi as electrically activating donor.

40|$|Although {{the clean}} Si(001) and Ge(001) {{surfaces}} are very similar, experiments {{to date have}} shown that dimer-vacancy (DV) defects self-organize into vacancy lines (VLs) on Si(001), but not on Ge(001). In this paper, we perform empirical-potential calculations aimed at understanding {{the differences between the}} vacancies on Si(001) and Ge(001). We identify three energetic parameters that characterize the DVs on the two surfaces: the <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> a single DV, the attraction between two DVs in adjacent dimer rows, and the strain sensitivity <b>of</b> the <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> DVs and VLs. At the empirical level of treatment of the atomic interactions (Tersoff potentials), all three parameters are favorable for the self-assembly of DVs on the Si(001) surface rather than on Ge(001). The most significant difference between the defects on Si(001) and on Ge(001) concerns the <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> single DVs, which is three times larger in the latter case. By calculating the strain-dependent <b>formation</b> <b>energies</b> <b>of</b> DVs and VLs, we propose that the experimental observation of self-assembly of vacancies on clean Ge(001) could be achieved by applying compressive strains of the order of 2 %.

40|$|Alignment of {{electrostatic}} potential between different atomic configurations {{is necessary for}} first-principles calculations of band offsets across interfaces and <b>formation</b> <b>energies</b> <b>of</b> charged defects. However, strong oscillations of this potential at the atomic scale make alignment challenging, especially when atomic geometries change considerably from bulk to the vicinity of defects and interfaces.
