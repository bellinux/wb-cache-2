It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low <b>in</b> <b>fiber.</b> Because of these characteristics, it is easy to over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself.

5|$|The vegetal diet of the Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} is high <b>in</b> <b>fiber</b> {{and only}} moderate in protein. Salt licks {{are very important}} to the nutrition of the rhino. These licks can be small hot springs, seepages of salty water, or mud-volcanoes. The salt licks also serve an important social purpose for the rhinos—males visit the licks to pick up the scent of females in oestrus. Some Sumatran rhinos, however, live in areas where salt licks are not readily available, or the rhinos have not been observed using the licks. These rhinos may get their necessary mineral requirements by consuming plants rich in minerals.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{verapamil}} on normal sodium (Na) -dependent and slow calcium (Ca) -de-pendent action potentials recorded from canine cardiac Purkinje fibers was studied. The Ca-dependent slow response was obtained <b>in</b> <b>fibers</b> exposed to solutions {{in which all}} NaCl was replaced by tetraethylammonium chloride and in which Ca ranged from 4 mM to 16. 2 mM. Verapamil (0. 25 - 2 mg/liter) {{had little or no}} effect on the upstroke of the normal ac-tion potential, but such concentrations of verapamil suppressed rhythmic activity and depressed excitability <b>in</b> <b>fibers</b> that showed Ca-dependent slow responses. Spontaneous activity and rhythmic activity evoked by long depolarizing pulses were depressed. Verapamil decreased the amplitude and the upstroke velocity and shifted the threshold potential toward zero <b>in</b> <b>fibers</b> that showed Ca-dependent slow responses. The effective-ness of verapamil varied with the level of Ca; 0. 25 mg/liter of verapamil was as effective in suppressing activity <b>in</b> <b>fibers</b> exposed to 4 mM Ca as was 2 mg/liter of verapamil <b>in</b> <b>fibers</b> exposed to 16. 2 mM Ca.

25|$|Attenuation <b>in</b> <b>fiber</b> optics, {{also known}} as {{transmission}} loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) as it travels through the transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients <b>in</b> <b>fiber</b> optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation {{is an important factor}} limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the attenuation and maximizing the amplification of the optical signal.|$|E

40|$|Secondary walls <b>in</b> <b>fibers</b> and tracheary {{elements}} constitute {{the most abundant}} biomass produced by plants. Although a number of genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary wall components have been characterized, {{little is known about}} the molecular mechanisms underlying the coordinated expression of these genes. Here, we demonstrate that the Arabidopsis thaliana NAC (for NAM, ATAF 1 / 2, and CUC 2) domain transcription factor, SND 1 (for secondary wall–associated NAC domain protein), is a key transcriptional switch regulating secondary wall synthesis <b>in</b> <b>fibers.</b> We show that SND 1 is expressed specifically <b>in</b> interfascicular <b>fibers</b> and xylary <b>fibers</b> <b>in</b> stems and that dominant repression of SND 1 causes a drastic reduction in the secondary wall thickening of fibers. Ectopic overexpression of SND 1 results in activation of the expression of secondary wall biosynthetic genes, leading to massive deposition of secondary walls in cells that are normally nonsclerenchymatous. In addition, we have found that SND 1 upregulates the expression of several transcription factors that are highly expressed <b>in</b> <b>fibers</b> during secondary wall synthesis. Together, our results reveal that SND 1 is a key transcriptional activator involved in secondary wall biosynthesis <b>in</b> <b>fibers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{relation}} between single skinned skeletal fiber contractile mechanics and the myosin mechanoenzyme was examined by perturbing the actomyosin {{interaction with the}} ATP analog CTP <b>in</b> <b>fibers</b> from both rabbit psoas and rat soleus. Tension, instantaneous stiffness, {{and the rate of}} tension redevelopment (ktr), under software-based sarcomere length control, were examined at 15 °C for a range of Ca 2 + concentrations <b>in</b> both <b>fiber</b> types. CTP produced 94 % of the maximum ATP-generated tension <b>in</b> psoas <b>fibers</b> and 77 % <b>in</b> soleus <b>fibers.</b> <b>In</b> psoas, CTP also increased stiffness to 106 % of the ATP stiffness, whereas in soleus stiffness decreased to 92 %. Thus, part of the greater difference between maximum ATP- and CTP-generated tension <b>in</b> soleus <b>fibers</b> appears to be due to a decrease in strongly bound cross-bridge number. Interestingly, although the nucleotide exchange produced substantial increases in the steepness (nH) of the tension- and stiffness-pCa relationships <b>in</b> soleus <b>fibers,</b> only minor changes were seen <b>in</b> psoas <b>fibers.</b> At maximum Ca 2 + and nominal Pi levels, ktr <b>in</b> psoas <b>fibers</b> increased from 11. 7 s- 1 with ATP to 16. 6 s- 1 with CTP and <b>in</b> soleus <b>fibers</b> from 4. 9 to 8. 4 s- 1. Increased Pi levels decreased the maximum Ca 2 +-activated tension <b>in</b> both <b>fiber</b> types and increased the ktr of psoas fibers, but the ktr of soleus fibers was not significantly altered. Thus, although the nucleotide exchange generally produced similar changes in the mechanics, there were significant muscle lineage differences in the tension- and stiffness-pCa relations and in the effects of Pi on ktr, such that differences in contractile mechanics were lessened in the presence of CTP...|$|R
