5|$|Douglas Carl Engelbart (January 30, 1925– July 2, 2013) was an American {{engineer}} and inventor, {{and an early}} computer and Internet pioneer.

These were demonstrated at The Mother of All Demos in 1968. Engelbart's Law, the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, is named after him.|$|E

In evolutionary terms, humans are able to acquire knowledge and change their behaviour to meet social standards, so humans behave in the manner of other humans.|$|E
5|$|In the prologue, John {{identifies}} Jesus as the Logos (Word). In Ancient Greek philosophy, {{the term}} logos meant {{the principle of}} cosmic reason. In this sense, it {{was similar to the}} Hebrew concept of Wisdom, God's companion and intimate helper <b>in</b> <b>creation.</b> The Hellenistic Jewish philosopher Philo merged these two themes when he described the Logos as God's creator of and mediator with the material world. The evangelist adapted Philo's description of the Logos, applying it to Jesus, the incarnation of the Logos.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{returned}} to the Senate in January 1965, walking with a cane. He employed a stronger and more effective legislative staff. He took on President Lyndon B. Johnson and almost succeeded in amending the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to explicitly ban the poll tax {{at the state and}} local level (rather than just directing the Attorney General to challenge its constitutionality there), thereby gaining a reputation for legislative skill. He was a leader in pushing through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended a quota system based upon national origin and which, despite Kennedy's predictions, would have a profound effect on the demographic makeup of the United States. He played a role <b>in</b> <b>creation</b> of the National Teachers Corps.|$|E

5|$|Ethnologists and anthropologists {{who study}} myths have {{developed}} various classification schemes {{for the various}} themes that appear <b>in</b> <b>creation</b> stories. For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a world egg; such stories include the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. In related stories, the Universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, and the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation narrative in which the Abrahamic God created the Universe. In another type of story, the Universe is created from the union {{of male and female}} deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa. In other stories, the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god— as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology– or from chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology. In other stories, the Universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as Brahman and Prakrti, the creation myth of the Serers, or the yin and yang of the Tao.|$|E

5|$|During Stalin's Great Purge in the late-1930s, {{which had}} not ended {{by the time of}} the German {{invasion}} on 22 June 1941, much of the officer corps of the Red Army was decimated and their replacements, appointed by Stalin for political reasons, often lacked military competence. Of the five Marshals of the Soviet Union appointed in 1935, only Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny survived Stalin's purge. Tukachevsky was killed in 1937. Fifteen of 16 army commanders, 50 of the 57 corps commanders, 154 of the 186 divisional commanders, and 401 of 456 colonels were killed, and many other officers were dismissed. In total, about 30,000 Red Army personnel were executed. Stalin further underscored his control by reasserting the role of political commissars at the divisional level and below to oversee the political loyalty of the army to the regime. The commissars held a position equal to that of the commander of the unit they were overseeing. But in spite of efforts to ensure the political subservience of the armed forces, in the wake of Red Army's poor performance in Poland and in the Winter War, about 80 percent of the officers dismissed during the Great Purge were reinstated by 1941. Also, between January 1939 and May 1941, 161 new divisions were activated. Therefore, although about 75 percent of all the officers had been in their position for less than one year at the start of the German invasion of 1941, many of the short tenures can be attributed not only to the purge, but also to the rapid increase <b>in</b> <b>creation</b> of military units.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} freedom {{which the}} Republic of Venice afforded him, {{compared to the}} problems of court politics in Mantua, are reflected in Monteverdi's letters to Striggio, particularly his letter of 13 March 1620, when he rejects an invitation to return to Mantua, extolling his present position and finances in Venice, and referring to the pension which Mantua still owes him. Nonetheless, remaining a Mantuan citizen, he accepted commissions from the new Duke Ferdinando, who had formally renounced his position as Cardinal in 1616 to take on the duties of state. These included the balli Tirsi e Clori (1616) and Apollo (1620), an opera Andromeda (1620) and an intermedio, Le nozze di Tetide, for the marriage of Ferdinando with Caterina de' Medici (1617). Most of these compositions were extensively delayed <b>in</b> <b>creation</b> – partly, as shown by surviving correspondence, through the composer's unwillingness to prioritise them, and partly because of constant changes in the court's requirements. They are now lost, apart from Tirsi e Clori, which was included in the seventh book of madrigals (published 1619) and dedicated to the Duchess Caterina, for which the composer received a pearl necklace from the Duchess. A subsequent major commission, the opera La finta pazza Licori, to a libretto by Giulio Strozzi, was completed for Fernando's successor Vincenzo II, who succeeded to the dukedom in 1626. Because of the latter's illness (he died in 1627), it was never performed, and it is now also lost.|$|E
25|$|Creation {{science is}} not falsifiable: An idea or {{hypothesis}} {{is generally not}} considered to be in the realm of science unless it can be potentially disproved with certain experiments, this is the concept of falsifiability in science. The act of creation as defined <b>in</b> <b>creation</b> science is not falsifiable because no testable bounds can be imposed on the creator. <b>In</b> <b>creation</b> science, the creator is defined as limitless, with the capacity to create (or not), through fiat alone, infinite universes, not just one, and endow each one with its own unique, unimaginable and incomparable character. It is impossible to disprove a claim when that claim as defined encompasses every conceivable contingency.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} – to determine relations between consumer engagement and created value {{in the context of the}} development of information and communication technologies. The first part of the dissertation is dedicated to the presentation of the concepts of value and consumer engagement, the introduction of the main characteristics of value and consumer engagement, identification and classification of consumer engagement antecedents and consequences. Summarizing the results of theoretical studies, the framework of consumer engagement <b>in</b> value <b>creation</b> <b>in</b> the context of the development of information and communication technologies was developed. In the second part of the dissertation, methodological principles of empirical research are presented. Empirical validation of consumer engagement <b>in</b> value <b>creation</b> <b>in</b> the context of the development of ICT model is based on original research methodology. The necessity to adapt multilevel research which integrates a strategy of sequential linking of qualitative and quantitative research methods is based on the relevance of consumer engagement <b>in</b> value <b>creation</b> <b>in</b> the context of the development of ICT. The majority of studies in this context are theoretical; there is a lack of empirically reasoned provisions regarding the antecedents and consequences of consumer engagement. The third part of the dissertation demonstrates consumer engagement <b>in</b> value <b>creation</b> <b>in</b> the context of the development of ICT model validating process and results based on performed qualitative and quantitative research. Results of research supported the hypothesized relations between consumer engagement and consumer perceived value and existing impact of consumer engagement on other engagement consequences. Moreover, antecedents of consumer engagement <b>in</b> value <b>creation</b> <b>in</b> the context of the development of ICT were identified during research...|$|R

25|$|The {{majority}} of the Dragon-Blooded <b>in</b> <b>Creation</b> make up the ruling class of the Realm, currently the most powerful empire <b>in</b> <b>Creation.</b> The state-sanctioned faith known as the Immaculate Order paints the Solar and Lunar Exalted as dangerous Anathema who will bring ruin to the world if allowed to exist. Because of this, the Realm organizes the Wyld Hunt, which actively seeks out newly Exalted Celestials (Solars and Lunars, although they also hunt Abyssals and fair folk as well) and overwhelms them before they can master their new powers. This practice, which had effectively kept the Solars from rising to power again {{since the end of}} the First Age, has faltered in the recent Exalted timeline because of the disappearance of the Scarlet Empress and the stability and leadership that she was able to bring to the Dragon-Blooded. The power struggle by the great Dragon-Blooded houses to fill the resulting power vacuum has destabilized the Realm and allowed the Solar Exalted to escape the purges of the Wyld Hunt and rise <b>in</b> <b>Creation</b> once more.|$|E
