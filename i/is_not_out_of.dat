5|$|Each title {{focuses on}} the {{extraordinary}} invading the ordinary world, though the two main Megami Tensei series focus on different things: Shin Megami Tensei focuses more on the main protagonist gaining the power needed {{to survive in a}} world ruled over by tyrannical deities, while Persona focuses on interpersonal relationships and the psychology of a group of people. That protagonist is generally male within the Shin Megami Tensei titles: while a female lead or the ability to choose a lead's gender <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the question, some staff feel that Shin Megami Tensei lead roles are better suited to a male character. Throughout its lifetime, the series has incorporated elements of Gnosticism, various world mythologies and religions including Christianity and Buddhism, early science fiction, Jungian psychology and archetypes, occultism, punk, and cyberpunk. The science fiction and fantasy elements are brought together and unified through the use of philosophical concepts, enabling a blending of concepts and aesthetics that might normally clash.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} scoring variations; under the first and simpler ruleset, {{the first player to}} pocket his private number wins. Under the second variation, {{although}} a player still wins by pocketing his private number, points are scored in various ways: 1) two points are given by each participant to the winning player for the pocketing of his private number; 2) a player receives one point for pocketing any other player's private number, and the player whose private number was pocketed is penalized one point (and can have a negative point total), but <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the game and can still win points in this way; 3) if a player whose private number is pocketed by another does not disclose this fact before a subsequent shot is taken, the non-disclosing player forfeits, immediately losing the game, and the player who made that ball is given two points instead of one. In the event that no player succeeds in pocketing his private number, gameplay ends when the last private number is potted, and the game is played again with all points values doubled.|$|E

25|$|Even {{those who}} oppose Crossan’s theory, like Deconick, find {{themselves}} confused when attempting to locate the possible source for Thomas. Even though she believes the Common Sayings Source theory is unlikely, she does admit that “Thomas emerged as an oral text,” which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> line from what Crossan has suggested.|$|E
25|$|Charlotte Lucas – Charlotte is Elizabeth's friend who, at 27 {{years old}} (and thus past prime {{marriage}} age), fears becoming {{a burden to}} her family and therefore agrees to marry Mr. Collins to gain financial security. Though the novel {{stresses the importance of}} love and understanding in marriage, Austen never seems to condemn Charlotte's decision to marry for money. She uses Charlotte to convey how women of her time would adhere to society's expectation for women to marry even if it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> love, but convenience. Charlotte is the daughter of Sir William Lucas and Lady Lucas, friends of Mrs. Bennet.|$|E
25|$|Cave divers {{occasionally}} visit Jordbrugrotta {{which is}} the most dived cave in Scandinavia. Most of the other approximately 200 caves in Rana are not suitable for diving, and formation of caves has been limited due most of the rock being granite. Another diveable cave nearby is Litjåga. Damming of Kallvatnet made diving in Jordbrugrotta possible. There have been multiple cases of fatalities and injuries among visiting cave divers, but the accident rate <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> proportion with the number of divers. The cave's passages were formed by the river Plura's flow through porous limestone. Rock formations include marble. Visibility in the cave is good.|$|E

25|$|This {{criticism}} {{is similar to}} the critic levelled at development in developing countries by authors such as James C. Scott, James Ferguson, and L. Lohman. Although peacekeeping and development are two different things, the logic behind the {{criticism is}} the same. The third-party officials-whether they are peacekeepers or agents of development-are isolated from the general populace, believing they know what is best, and refusing to gather information from a ground level. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> maliciousness or imperialism, but out of a legitimate belief that they, as educated officials with access to other experts and who are well versed in development and peacekeeping literature, know what is best.|$|E
500|$|Pastoral theologian Herbert Anderson {{has written}} that the child's {{perspective}} of reality in Mulberry Street can be challenging and seem subversive to an adult. He argues that Marco's internal {{story of what happened}} on his walk was not dishonest or rebellious, but a natural [...] "openness to constructing a world". [...] The child's untruthful response that he had not seen anything interesting on Mulberry Street <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> disrespect to the parent, but is Marco's attempt to reconcile his perspective with the authoritative, adult one of his father.|$|E
500|$|After {{becoming}} the Commissioner of the WSOP, he negotiated partnerships with ESPN, Sirius radio, Glu Mobile, Bluff Media, AOL, and Betfair. [...] He also arranged sponsorships with Miller Brewing Company, Planters and Hershey’s. In 2006, Card Player Media provided hand-by-hand reporting, streamed player interviews, gave player recaps and displayed real-time chip count on its website. Once Pollack {{was asked if}} professional poker players would start wearing uniforms covered with ads, similar to NASCAR. [...] He responded, [...] "That <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the realm of possibility.

500|$|When {{creating}} a character, his process was to draw their {{face and body}} type first, and then the clothes, while thinking if the fighters can move around in them. He said {{that he does not}} draw [...] "bad guys" [...] so unscrupulous that it affects readers psychologically. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> concern for others, but because he does not enjoy drawing such things. Few of his characters have screentone because he found it difficult to use. Toriyama was not concerned about consistency with the color of characters' clothes for the occasional color pages, having sometimes used different ones than he had before. He even specifically asked Torishima to produce as few color pages as possible. Character names are almost always puns sharing a theme with characters related to them, most commonly food. For example, all Saiyans are named after vegetables, [...] being an anagram of the syllables for [...] which means vegetable; such as [...] taken from [...]|$|E
500|$|Observers {{agree that}} Pandey's ordeal {{has brought a}} change to public conversations about women's issues, with men joining in the discussions as well. A young woman who had taken part in the protests {{at the time of}} the rape said a year later, [...] "A welcome change is that the taboo on {{discussing}} rape and sexual violence has been broken. The protests brought debates and discussions to our homes." [...] She also said that since the rape and protests the media is now providing coverage of sexual violence. However, she saw [...] "absolutely no change in the rape culture and related brutality. The streets are not safe. Teasing [...] and catcalling or worse are to be found everywhere. Sexual harassment in public places as well as inside the home is still rampant." [...] She added, [...] "I do acknowledge, however, that a year is too less to undo what patriarchy has done over centuries. It is too embedded in our homes, our institutions and in our laws. The police may be a little more receptive, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a sense of duty but out of the fear of censure".|$|E
500|$|Releases {{from major}} studios – such as The Big Lebowski (1998), which was {{distributed}} by Universal Studios – can become cult films when they fail {{at the box}} office and develop a cult following through reissues, such as midnight movies, festivals, and home video. [...] Hollywood films, due to their nature, are more likely to attract this kind of attention, which leads to a mainstreaming effect of cult culture. [...] With major studios behind them, even financially unsuccessful films can be re-released multiple times, which plays into a trend to capture audiences through repetitious reissues. [...] The constant use of profanity and drugs in otherwise mainstream, Hollywood films, such as The Big Lebowski, can alienate critics and audiences yet lead to a large cult following among more open-minded demographics not often associated with cult films, such as Wall Street bankers and professional soldiers. [...] Thus, even comparatively mainstream films can satisfy the traditional demands of a cult film, perceived by fans as transgressive, niche, and uncommercial. [...] Discussing his reputation for making cult films, Bollywood director Anurag Kashyap said, [...] "I didn't set out to make cult films. I wanted to make box-office hits." [...] Writing in Cult Cinema, academics Ernest Mathijs and Jamie Sexton state that this acceptance of mainstream culture and commercialism <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> character, as cult audiences have a more complex relationship to these concepts: they are more opposed to mainstream values and excessive commercialism than they are anything else.|$|E

500|$|Halo 5 shows Halsey {{explaining}} that Cortana has recovered from Rampancy and attained meta-stability by {{gaining access to}} The Domain, a Forerunner database {{thought to have been}} destroyed with the firing of the Halo Array. How the UNSC and Halsey are aware that Cortana gained access to The Domain is unknown. She explains to Master Chief on Genesis that she survived by falling through slipspace, and likens the Domain to the [...] "Water Of Life for AI's". Her goal now is to preserve an ever lasting peace by subjugating all biological life. Whether this is a direct reaction to her link with The Domain, influence from The Didact (as their goals are now extremely similar) or some other external influence is yet to be known. With all Promethean troops and most Forerunner tech now under her command, and believing she cannot trust the Chief, who tries to reason with her, she converts most, if not all of the UNSC's AI constructs to her cause and begins her assault by plunging Humanity into a new Dark Age, using the Guardian's EMP abilities to shut off most UNSC technology, except The Infinity which barely escapes with Roland, the ship's AI, still intact and seemingly loyal. In the Legendary Ending, a Halo ring can be seen activating accompanied by Cortana humming. Whether she found it or built it is unknown although, considering she has access to the Domain, the Guardians, Forerunner tech and a multitude of different AI constructs at her disposal, building her own ring <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the realms of possibility.|$|E
2500|$|This woman's {{voice is}} exceptional. It breaks the moulds of all singing schools, {{as much as}} she breaks the moulds of any built music. When she seems to be out of tune, she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> tune: on the contrary, she is {{incredibly}} in tune as, owing to the special miracle of this style and the passion with which she sings third tones and quarter tones, impossible to record on the staff.

2500|$|Egyptologist David Rohl {{suggested}} that the legendary Garden of Eden was near Tabriz. Archaeologist Eric H. Cline commented on Rohl's views, writing that [...] "his suggestions have not caught on with the scholarly establishment. His argument is not helped {{by the fact that}} it depends upon speculations regarding the transmission of place-names for both the various rivers and nearby related areas from antiquity to the present. In the end, while Rohl’s suggestion <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the question, it seems no more probable than any other hypothesis, and less likely than those suggested by Speiser, Zarins, and Sauer." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Florida's {{vulnerability}} to hurricanes is well known, hurricanes {{are not the}} most common severe weather threat seen in the Polk County area. The area is {{in the center of}} [...] "lightning alley", the most concentrated lightning strike area in the United States. Lightning is not the only threat from central Florida thunderstorms. The more severe storms bring the threat of tornadoes, although Florida tornadoes very rarely reach the size of those elsewhere in the United States. Even hail <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the question; one storm in March 1996 caused a one-foot accumulation of hail in areas of Bartow.|$|E
