40|$|Most of the time, lawyers {{represent}} clients. But {{lawyers can}} be consulted and paid, but {{not serve as}} lawyers for clients, for example when they are sought out as friends, escrow agents, corporate officers or expert witnesses. The law governing lawyers recognizes {{the significance of the}} client-lawyer relationship by imposing fiduciary duties on lawyers who undertake a client representation. These duties, the 2 ̆ 24 C 2 ̆ 7 s, 2 ̆ 2 include communication, competence, confidentiality, and conflict of interest resolution. A wide variety of legal remedies for breach of the 4 C 2 ̆ 7 s, including malpractice, fee forfeiture, disqualification, constructive trust, and professional discipline also belong primarily to clients. When lawyers do not represent clients, these obligations and remedies recede considerably, and other aspects of the client-lawyer relationship, such as the attorney-client privilege, do not attach. And lawyers who represent clients do assume limited but important duties to certain third persons and the courts, obligations that can conflict with client loyalty. For example, lawyers have affirmative obligations not to assist client crimes and frauds and on occasion, to disclose client confidences to prevent them. Lawyers also must be able to identify whether opposing parties or witnesses are represented or unrepresented persons to avoid prohibited <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>contact.</b> In most situations, lawyers know their clients. But increasingly, the law governing lawyers has identified 2 ̆ 2 accidental 2 ̆ 2 clients: those a lawyer had no intention of representing, and may not even have been aware existed. This article considers the scope and extent of these legally recognized client-lawyer relationships, many of which can be created 2 ̆ 2 accidentally 2 ̆ 2 from the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s point of view. Some may seem obvious; others have surprised even the most knowledgeable lawyers.

40|$|Emails {{released}} {{beginning in}} the fall of 2014 demonstrate several improper private communications between high-level utility officials and decision-makers at the California Public Utility Commission (“CPUC”). The email chains show discussions ranging from a utility repeatedly lobbying on the outcome of an enforcement matter or aggressively pushing for a new judge assignment, to a commissioner soliciting donations to a political campaign or a banquet fund. Entities in the transportation industry have also alleged improper contacts with CPUC officials. In each instance, the CPUC decision-makers did not report the communications or insist that the utilities stop sending them. Rather, they actively participated in the exchanges and, if anything, encouraged them. In the judicial and adjudicatory context, courts, legislatures and public agencies have long prohibited private communications with decision-makers to ensure a fair outcome and preserve the integrity of governmental action. These private communications are called <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>contacts.</b> Even though the CPUC uses a judicial-type of process to gather information for the record and allow for argument by interested parties, it broadly permits <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>contacts</b> in ratemaking proceedings, which are the majority of the CPUC’s contested cases. In addition, as many of the revealed emails indicate, some CPUC decision-makers have allowed for ex parte communications in circumstances in which all such contacts are strictly prohibited. Many decision-makers in the CPUC regularly engage in off-the-record communications with utilities and other stakeholders, creating a culture of conversations with parties occurring behind closed doors. The recent disclosures have caused many to seriously question the CPUC’s decisionmaking process. To restore the integrity of the CPUC’s process, the agency and the legislature should change the applicable rules. An analysis of practices in other state and federal agencies reveals that federal regulators, other California agencies, and utility regulators in most other states make similar decisions without allowing for <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>contacts.</b> While the CPUC places no constraints on private communications related to legislative rulemaking proceedings, many ex parte rules examined in this analysis take a more nuanced approach and focus on whether a proceeding is contested, hearings are held, or substantive rights might be affected...|$|E
40|$|In this Article, I {{argue that}} commission-driven {{redistricting}} (and the “apolitical” process enshrined therein) frustrates a citizen’s right to meaningfully participate in electoral design. This right is fundamental, and {{has long been}} safeguarded by the First Amendment’s assertion that “Congress shall make no law... abridging... {{the right of the}} people... to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. ” Accordingly, I propose that courts use the Petition Clause as a constitutional remedy against rules that abridge substantive public input in commission-driven redistricting. To illustrate this claim, I analyze how one commonly adopted commission rule—the <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>contacts</b> prohibition—limits democratic choice. Then, I examine how a court might deploy the First Amendment to repair the harm inflicted by the rule...|$|E
40|$|The broader {{goal of this}} Article is {{to better}} {{understand}} the relationship between how a legal system functions and how judges communicate, both {{with each other and with}} other parties, including the media, the public, and political actors. Information transmission is an important but poorly understood part of any legal system. A precedent system, amid briefs, and the rules on <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>contacts</b> all serve to regulate how parties in a system communicate and what kind of information 2 ̆ 2 counts. 2 ̆ 2 Media and political pressure cannot help but affect a legal system. In the words of Ethan Katsh, 2 ̆ 2 Law is an organism whose lifeblood is information and media of communication are the veins and arteries. 2 ̆ 2 This Article is divided into three parts.
