40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Incubation {{experiments}} with an acid poorly drained soil {{have shown that}} the application of neutral soluble salts influenced the level of extractable Mn. The application of a salt which lowered the soil pH either increased the extractable Mn or retarded the oxidation and/or fixation of extractable Mn. This effect was independent of the applied salt, although salts which had the greatest effect on soil pH generally had the largest effect on extractable Mn. Comparisons of K₂SO₄ with KNO₃ at equivalent concentrations of K and with K₂SO₄ at different ionic strengths showed a small but nonsignificant effect of ionic strength on the level of extractable Mn. This indicated that the solubility of the Mn oxides was largely pH dependent and that ionic strength considerations were of secondary importance. The effect of the C 1 salt was over and above that of the general salt effect. The application of KC 1 always released more extractable Mn than either the KNO₃ or the K₂SO₄ treatment. This was not a strict pH effect since the KNO₃ and KC 1 treatments always had the same effect on soil pH. It was also not an ionic strength effect since the relative ionic strength of the K₂SO₄ treatment was 1. 5 times greater than that of the KC 1 treatment, and biological activity was not a factor in well aerated conditions. To explain the C 1 effect, a hypothesis has been presented in which C 1 would function in an oxidation-reduction reaction. In these reactions, C 1 could act either as the electron donor or as an <b>electron</b> <b>bridge</b> between the reductant and oxidant. Evidence that would support this hypothesis was: 1. The similarity between the effect of KC 1 and KBr on extractable Mn, i,e., the KBr treatment released more extractable Mn than the KC 1 according to theory. 2, Theoretical considerations of some of the conditions which were possible in the soil system showed that both C 1 and Br had the potential to reduce the lower Mn oxides under those conditions. 3.

30|$|More recently, due to arising of {{different}} methods of graphene preparation, the unique electrical property of graphene and promising electrochemical characteristics of PANI, {{combination of the}} two draw great attention. Studies in the field covered both the combination of graphene oxide and graphene with PANI. Methods of fabrication included in situ polymerization of aniline [229 – 232], filtration of the mixed dispersion [233, 234] and grafting PANI nanofibers to the edge of graphene sheets [235, 236] as well as layer-by-layer self-assemble method [237]. Further studies use functionalized graphene to composite with PANI in order to obtain higher capacitance. Li et al. [229] synthesized sandwich-like graphene/PANI composite in which PANI particles covered homogeneously {{on the surface of the}} graphene sheets at lower aniline ratio. Increasing the aniline ratio leaded to larger particle size of the deposited PANI. When the aniline ratio exceeded 12 : 1, fibrous PANI grew simultaneously with the sandwich composite. In situ polymerization can also produce graphene/PANI nanofiber composite in which nanofibers stick paralleled onto graphene sheets [231]. PANI was reported to anchor onto partially reduced graphene sheets and form a loose flower-like structure that extended the specific surface area of the material [238]. Polymerization of PANI in the presence of graphene oxide could result in the direct exfoliation of GO. PANI grew into layered GO causing peeling of the GO layers forming a single-layered GO/PANI nanosheet with folded edge [239]. Wu et al. [234] developed supercapacitor based on paper-like flexible graphene/PANI nanofiber composite films. The films obtained by filtrating mixed dispersions of graphene nanosheets and PANI nanofibers showing high flexibility that could be bent into large angles. By directly filtration of an in situ polymerized, a mixture of PANI and GO and a mixture of reduced GO, Yan et al. [233] obtained flexible composites paper and found that compactable small particles were formed on the GO sheets while nanorods and large particles were formed on the reduced GO substrate. The authors assumed that nanorods came from the individual PANI fibres formed in the aqueous phase, but why PANI fibres adsorbed onto graphene not GO was not explained. A comparison study on surface functionalities of GO with N and NH 2 groups was carried out by Lai et al. [240]. It was found NH 2 -functionalized GO/PANI (NH 2 -GO/PANI) showed high conductive stable composite. Interestingly, an increase in capacitance was observed for NH 2 -GO/PANI composite. The authors suspected that the amine functional groups assisted the doping and dedoping in PANI causing the enhancement of capacitance in long cycles. Others [235, 236] tried grafting PANI nanofibers to the edge of graphene sheets through an amide-connecting system. The PANI nanofiber connected to the graphene intimately and distributed homogeneously along of graphene layers inhabiting the agglomeration of the layers. Computing of the electronic densities of the system showed that π-π conjugation was extended from graphene to PANI chains through the amide group.

Furthermore, the spectra of T- 2 p shows the characteristic absorption peak of phenyl ring at 1621 and 1468  cm−[*] 1 corresponding to ZnTCP, indicating {{the existence of}} ZnTCP {{on the surface of}} sensitized TiO 2 [44]. However, the signal corresponding to -OH vibration peak disappeared, which demonstrates the formation of ester chemical bond between ZnTCP and TiO 2. The stretching vibration of the C=O bond of ester group is clearly observed at 1713  cm− 1 [45], further confirmed ZnTCP combined to TiO 2 -HNBs composites. The above information indicates that the TiO 2 -HNBs surface has been successfully functionalized with ZnTCP molecules. After sensitization, the spectra of T- 2 p show an increased intensity of the stretching vibration peak at 520  cm− 1 and the characteristic absorption bands in the region of 1200 ~ 1060  cm− 1 attributed to the CO-O-Ti bond resulting from the esterification between COOH of ZnTCP and OH of TiO 2 [46]. This reveals that the strong interaction (conjugated chemical bonds) between ZnTCP and TiO 2 -HNBs was established rather than simple physical adsorption.

Due to the superior sensitization and biomimetic activity of ZnTCP, the photodegradation rate of rhodamine B (RhB) of as-prepared ZnTCP@TiO 2 -HNBs with ZnTCP/TiOF 2 mass ratio of 2 % (T- 2 p) improves 3.6 times {{compared to that of}} TiO 2 -HNBs with a degradation yield of 99 % for 2  h under simulated sunlight irradiation (>[*] 420  nm).

Furthermore, the photocatalyst showed good recycling stability and dispersibility after five rounds, ascribed to ZnTCP strong chemical bonding to the support TiO 2 -HNBs.

Intermyofibrillar bridges, spaced approximately 1. 9 um apart, were observed within bovine sternomandibularis muscle restrained prior to fixation. Spacing between intermyofibrillar bridges was from 1. 0 to 1. 4 um within bovine sternomandibularis muscle unrestrained prior to fixation. Using transmission <b>electron</b> microscopy, <b>bridges</b> between adjacent myofribrils were found at or near the Z-lines. Endomysial connective tissue contained reticular fiber rows arranged either obliquely or perpendicularly to the long axis of myofibers. Reticular fiber arrangement may be dependent upon the degree of muscle shortening. however, irrespective of the degree of restraint, periodicity between reticular fiber rows was found to be approximately 4. 0 um within bovine sternomandibularis muscle and approximately 3. 3 um within rabbit semimembranosus muscle...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the two-subunit cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans has been refined using X-ray cryodata to 2. 25 Å resolution {{in order to gain}} further insights into its mechanism of action. The refined structural model shows a number of new features including many additional solvent and detergent molecules. The <b>electron</b> density <b>bridging</b> the heme a 3 iron and Cu B of the active site is fitted best by a peroxogroup or a chloride ion. Two waters or OH − groups do not fit, one water (or OH −) does not provide sufficient electron density. The analysis of crystals of cytochrome c oxidase isolated in the presence of bromide instead of chloride appears to exclude chloride as the bridging ligand. In the D-pathway a hydrogen bonded chain of six water molecules connects Asn 131 and Glu 278, but the access for protons to this water chain is blocked by Asn 113, Asn 131 and Asn 199. The K-pathway contains two firmly bound water molecules, an additional water chain seems to form its entrance. Above the hemes a cluster of 13 water molecules is observed which potentially form multiple exit pathways for pumped protons. The hydrogen bond pattern excludes that the CuB ligand His 326 is present in the imidazolate for...|$|R
