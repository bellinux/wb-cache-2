25|$|Four {{days after}} Harvick's Daytona 500 win {{in his first}} race with Shell-Pennzoil as the primary sponsors, his team owner Richard Childress was asked by NASCAR to {{downsize}} the Shell logo on his <b>fire</b> <b>suit</b> and to have Harvick wear a more prominent Pennzoil logo, {{in an effort to}} play down any perceived competition with NASCAR fuel supplier Sunoco. This company asked NASCAR to talk with Childress after Harvick won both the Nationwide Series and Sprint Cup Series races wearing a prominent Shell logo on his <b>fire</b> <b>suit.</b> For the rest of the season, Harvick won the Sprint All-Star Race and finished 10th in points.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{the scene}} with the burning camp was [...] "tricky", {{according}} to Kim Manners. When they were filming the scene, they had huge [...] "safety precautions" [...] ready for the cast and crew. The fires seen in the episode, were in reality propane fires. Manners wanted the shots to be {{as close to the}} fire as possible, so they used fireproof cameras. According to Manners, [...] "they used a half a million dollar camera on a crane wrapped in asbestos" [...] and ran it through the flames. For the following scene, the production crew set a man on fire, while using a <b>fire</b> <b>suit.</b> This stunt is known as [...] a [...] "full burn." [...] Scenes like this are [...] "very dangerous" [...] as one can't breathe. In total, he was on fire between 25–30 seconds, which is seen as a lot by filming standards. Special effects supervisor Tony Lindala supervised the creation of the faceless alien rebels, Dmitri's mutilation, and the incinerated victims of the rebels. Lindala also designed the rig used to infect Dmitri with the black oil.|$|E
500|$|Throughout filming, various scenes {{make use}} of all three effects departments. For scenes {{involving}} the floating, fiery spirit of Mary Winchester in [...] "Home", a small and slim stuntman wearing a <b>fire</b> <b>suit</b> was lit on fire and raised into the air on wires. For the spirit's transition into Mary's normal form, Smith {{stood in front of}} a black background with wind blowing onto her, and the two scenes were later combined in post-production. Many aspects went into filming the crash scene in the season finale [...] "Devil's Trap". For the interior scenes used in the first moments of the Impala being hit, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Padalecki, and Ackles were required to sit in the car, which was in front of a blue screen. A sheet of Lexan placed very close to the passenger-side window protected the actors as the window was shattered, and at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window exploded onto them. For scenes of the actual crash, the car and truck were cabled together by a winch, and driven toward one another. The intention was for a cannon to launch the Impala into the air at the collision point, causing the car to then barrel roll as the truck drives away. However, the car became stuck in the truck's bumper, forcing the cannon to fail and the truck to go out of control. The truck began to jackknife, but the stuntman driving it saved it from flipping. The mistake ended up being beneficial for the scene, as Kripke and director Manners found it to look [...] "pretty real".|$|E

2500|$|At first {{practice}} for the Sharpie 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway on August 24, the #31 car was colored orange and black, but was bare; that is, associate sponsors appeared, but no primary sponsors were on the car, similar to Formula One cars run in races where tobacco advertising is prohibited. The pit crew wore grey Richard Childress Racing shirts and Burton had a plain orange <b>fire</b> <b>suit</b> with associate sponsors. The car, which carried a [...] "subliminal advertising" [...] scheme, arrived in a black hauler with only the number 31 on the side. NASCAR officials said the car {{would not have made}} it through inspection with the AT logos. During that weekend, AT claimed that two alternate paint schemes proposed by AT— one advertising its [...] "go phone" [...] and another with the old Cingular slogan [...] "more bars in more places" [...] that AT recently brought back— were rejected by NASCAR. The Go Phone scheme had been used in the past. NASCAR later denied these claims.|$|E

50|$|Since 2002, NASCAR has {{implemented}} a rule where {{all over the}} wall pit members are required to wear helmets, no visors needed, full <b>fire</b> <b>suits,</b> and gloves; while the gas man must wear a fire apron {{as well as the}} suit. While it is not required yet, it is recommended that tire changers wear safety glasses to prevent eye injuries from lug nuts thrown off the car and fuel spills. Some tire changers wear face shields or goggles.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first person}} to inquire about and use his {{parachute}} was [...] "Big Daddy" [...] Don Garlits. He evolved his business {{into a number of}} other safety items, such as gloves, helmets, restraints and shoes. Simpson designed NASA's first umbilical cords, where he met Pete Conrad. Conrad introduced Simpson to DuPont product Nomex in 1967. Simpson used the product to create the first <b>fire</b> <b>suit</b> to be used in racing. He took the suit to the 1967 Indianapolis 500 where it was worn by 30 of 33 drivers. Simpson had developed over 200 racing safety products, including three generations of fire suits. Simpson demonstrated the suit's effectiveness in 1987, when he was set on fire while wearing a suit. To this day, drivers in the NHRA refer to their fire suits as the [...] "Simpson Suit," [...] primarily {{due to the fact that}} Simpson Performance Products is synonymous with the <b>fire</b> <b>suit,</b> and also, even to this day, the Simpson name still appears on several of the fire suits, including those worn by the NHRA's Safety Safari crews.|$|E
50|$|Safety in NASCAR {{has evolved}} {{into one of the}} biggest {{concerns}} in stock car racing's largest sanctioning body. Mainly after the death of Dale Earnhardt, a seven time Winston Cup Series champion, NASCAR has decided to change all of their safety policies, {{such as the use of}} the HANS device. Since 2001, NASCAR has also changed the cars for the Sprint Cup Series and the Xfinity Series. NASCAR's safety policy includes the racing <b>fire</b> <b>suit,</b> carbon fiber seating, and roof flaps.|$|E
50|$|Mini monster {{trucks are}} not {{carbureted}} {{and the design}} includes a full roll cage and safety features. As most mini monster trucks are custom built, not {{all have the same}} safety features. When based on a go-kart or ATV chassis, safety features vary. Professional mini monster trucks are built with comparable safety features to those of standard monster trucks. In youth racing competitions, trucks are built with limiters, and will not go faster than 25 mph. Other standard safety requirements are <b>fire</b> <b>suits,</b> safety helmets, a radio-operated remote ignition interrupt system, and driver-to-crew radio systems that keep the drivers in contact with adults at all times.|$|R

50|$|In {{some areas}} of Japan, Japanese fire {{departments}} use off-road motorcycles as emergency vehicles. They are useful for negotiating the small streets and heavy traffic in the large urban areas of Japanese cities. Having off-road motorcycles helps {{in responding to the}} mountain hills that are around a lot of cities. Some departments would likely have their crews in teams of two or three motorcycles. One of the motorcycles carries a first aid kit and/or automated external defibrillator. The other motorcycles in this team may carry fire fighting and rescue equipment. Most crews are firefighters with training in first responder, First Aid, and/or paramedic. Each crew member wears a lightweight <b>fire</b> <b>suit</b> and a fire fighting motorcycle helmet. A lot of these motorcycles have their own radio, cargo bays, lights and sirens.|$|E
