25|$|As {{previously}} described, enzymes such as <b>horseradish</b> <b>peroxidase</b> or {{alkaline phosphatase}} {{are commonly used}} to catalyse reactions that give a coloured or chemiluminescent product. Fluorescent molecules can be visualised using fluorescence microscopy or confocal microscopy.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme <b>horseradish</b> <b>peroxidase</b> (HRP), {{found in}} the plant, is used {{extensively}} in molecular biology and biochemistry primarily {{for its ability to}} amplify a weak signal and increase detectability of a target molecule. HRP has been used in decades of research to visualize under microscopy and assess non-quantitatively the permeability of capillaries, particularly those of the brain.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that periods of intense {{stimulation}} at neural synapses deplete vesicle count as well as increase cellular capacitance and surface area. This indicates that after synaptic vesicles release their neurotransmitter payload, they merge with and become part of, the cellular membrane. After tagging synaptic vesicles with HRP (<b>horseradish</b> <b>peroxidase),</b> Heuser and Reese found that portions of the cellular membrane at the frog neuromuscular junction were taken up by the cell and converted back into synaptic vesicles. Studies suggest that the entire cycle of exocytosis, retrieval, and reformation of the synaptic vesicles requires less than 1 minute.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used method is to perform a Western blot against the protein of interest—this gives information {{on the size of}} the protein in addition to its identity. A sample (often cellular lysate) is separated on a polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a membrane and then probed with an antibody to the protein of interest. The antibody can either be conjugated to a fluorophore or to <b>horseradish</b> <b>peroxidase</b> for imaging and/or quantification. The gel-based nature of this assay makes quantification less accurate, but it has the advantage of being able to identify later modifications to the protein, for example proteolysis or ubiquitination, from changes in size.|$|E
25|$|Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) uses antigen-coated microtitre plates for the {{detection}} of ANAs. Each well of a microtitre plate is coated with either a single antigen or multiple antigens to detect specific antibodies or to screen for ANAs, respectively. The antigens are either from cell extracts or recombinant. Blood serum is incubated in the wells of the plate and is washed out. If antibodies that bind to antigen are present then they will remain after washing. A secondary anti-human antibody conjugated to an enzyme such as <b>horseradish</b> <b>peroxidase.</b> The enzyme reaction will produce a change in colour of the solution that is proportional to the amount of antibody bound to the antigen. There are significant differences in {{the detection}} of ANA by immunofluorescence and different ELISA kits and there is only a marginal agreement between these. A clinician must be familiar with the differences in order to evaluate the outcomes of the various assays.|$|E
2500|$|Enhanced {{chemiluminescence}} is {{a common}} technique {{for a variety of}} detection assays in biology. [...] A <b>horseradish</b> <b>peroxidase</b> enzyme (HRP) is tethered to an antibody that specifically recognizes the molecule of interest. [...] This enzyme complex then catalyzes the conversion of the enhanced chemiluminescent substrate into a sensitized reagent {{in the vicinity of the}} molecule of interest, which on further oxidation by hydrogen peroxide, produces a triplet (excited) carbonyl, which emits light when it decays to the singlet carbonyl. [...] Enhanced chemiluminescence allows detection of minute quantities of a biomolecule. Proteins can be detected down to femtomole quantities, well below the detection limit for most assay systems.|$|E
2500|$|After rinsing the {{membrane}} to remove unbound primary antibody, {{the membrane}} {{is exposed to}} another antibody, directed at a species-specific portion of the primary antibody. Antibodies come from animal sources (or animal sourced hybridoma cultures); an anti-mouse secondary will bind to almost any mouse-sourced primary antibody, which allows some cost savings by allowing an entire lab to share a single source of mass-produced antibody, and provides far more consistent results. This {{is known as a}} secondary antibody, and due to its targeting properties, tends to be referred to as [...] "anti-mouse", [...] "anti-goat", etc. [...] The secondary antibody is usually linked to biotin or a reporter enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase or <b>horseradish</b> <b>peroxidase.</b> This means that several secondary antibodies will bind to one primary antibody and enhance the signal.|$|E
5000|$|For example, <b>horseradish</b> <b>peroxidase</b> can use {{a variety}} of organic {{compounds}} as electron donors and acceptors. <b>Horseradish</b> <b>peroxidase</b> has an accessible active site, and many compounds can reach the site of the reaction.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Horseradish</b> <b>peroxidase</b> {{is ideal}} {{in many respects}} for these {{applications}} because it is smaller, more stable, and less expensive than other popular alternatives such as alkaline phosphatase. It also has a high turnover rate that allows generation of strong signals {{in a relatively short}} time span. [...] It should be noted that high concentrations of phosphate severely decrease stability of <b>horseradish</b> <b>peroxidase.</b> In addition to biomedical applications, <b>horseradish</b> <b>peroxidase</b> is one of the enzymes with important environmental applications. This enzyme is suitable for the removal of hydroxylated aromatic compounds (HACs) that are considered to be primary pollutants {{in a wide variety of}} industrial wastewater.|$|E

5000|$|Nanoreactors {{can also}} be built by {{controlling}} the positioning of two different enzymes in the central water reservoir or the plastic membrane of synthetic nanoscopic bubbles. Once the third enzyme is added into the surrounding solution, it becomes possible for three different enzymatic reactions to occur at once without interfering with each other (resulting in a [...] "one-pot" [...] reaction). The potential for nanoreactors can be demonstrated by binding the enzyme <b>horseradish</b> <b>peroxidase</b> into the membrane itself; trapping the enzyme glucose oxidase. The surrounding solution would end up containing the enzyme lipase B with the glucose molecules containing four acetyl groups as the substrate. The resulting glucose would cross the membrane, become oxidized, and the <b>horseradish</b> <b>peroxidase</b> would convert the sample substrate ABTS (2,2’-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) into its radical cation.|$|E
50|$|Enzymes used in ELISAs include <b>horseradish</b> <b>peroxidase</b> (HRP), {{alkaline}} phosphatase (AP) or glucose oxidase. These enzymes allow for detection often because they produce an observable color {{change in the}} presence of certain reagents. In some cases these enzymes are exposed to reagents which cause them to produce light or Chemiluminescence.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{substrates}} for the <b>horseradish</b> <b>peroxidase</b> enzyme {{have been}} described and commercialized to exploit the desirable features of HRP. These substrates fall into several distinct categories. HRP catalyzes the conversion of chromogenic substrates (e.g., TMB, DAB, ABTS) into colored products, and produces light when acting on chemiluminescent substrates (e.g. Enhanced Chemiluminescence by luminol).|$|E
