The paper illustrates development in application of the relatively new experimental technique to the complex environment of internal flows in turbomachines. First, there is a short explanation of the physics of the PSP technique and a discussion of calibration methods for pressure <b>sensitive</b> <b>paint</b> in the turbomachinery environment. A description of the image conversion process follows. The recorded image of the stator vane pressure field is skewed due to the limited optical access and must be converted to the meridional plane projection for comparison with analytical predictions. The experimental results for seven operating conditions along an off-design rotational speed line are shown in a concise form, including performance map points, mindspan static tap pressure distributions, and vane suction side pressure fields. Then, a comparison between static tap and pressure <b>sensitive</b> <b>paint</b> data is discussed.

40|$|Pressure <b>sensitive</b> <b>paint</b> is a newly-developed optical {{measurement}} technique with {{which one can}} get a continuous pressure distribution in much shorter time and lower cost than a conventional pressure tap measurement. However, most of the current pressure <b>sensitive</b> <b>paint</b> applications are restricted to steady pressure measurement at high speeds {{because of the small}} signal-to-noise ratio at low speed and a slow response to pressure changes. In the present study, three phases of work have been completed to extend the application of the pressure <b>sensitive</b> <b>paint</b> technique to low-speed testing and to investigate the applicability of the paint technique to unsteady flow. First the measurement system using a commercially available PtOEP/GP- 197 pressure <b>sensitive</b> <b>paint</b> was established and applied to impinging jet measurements. An in-situ calibration using only five pressure tap data points was applied and the results showed good repeatability and good agreement with conventional pressure tap measurements on the whole painted area. The overall measurement accuracy in these experiments was found to be within 0. 1 psi. The pressure <b>sensitive</b> <b>paint</b> technique was then applied to low-speed wind tunnel tests using a 60 deg delta wing model with leading edge blowing slots. The technical problems encountered in low-speed testing were resolved by using a high grade CCD camera and applying corrections to improve the measurement accuracy. Even at 35 m/s, the paint data not only agreed well with conventional pressure tap measurements but also clearly showed the suction region generated by the leading edge vortices. The vortex breakdown was also detected at alpha= 30 deg. It was found that a pressure difference of 0. 2 psi was required for a quantitative pressure measurement in this experiment and that temperature control or a parallel temperature measurement is necessary if thermal uniformity does not hold on the model. Finally, the pressure <b>sensitive</b> <b>paint</b> was applied to a periodically changing pressure field with a 12. 8 s time period. A simple first-order pole model was applied to deal with the phase lag of the paint. The unsteady pressure estimated from the time-changing pressure <b>sensitive</b> <b>paint</b> data agreed well with the pressure transducer data in regions of higher pressure and showed the possibility of extending the technique to unsteady pressure measurements. However, the model still needs further refinement based on the physics of the oxygen diffusion into the paint layer and the oxygen quenching on the paint luminescence...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the preparation {{and evaluation of}} new materials for imaging of barometric pressure and temperature using so-called luminescent paints. The historical background and the motivation for the research conducted are given in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 summarizes {{the basic principles of}} photoluminescence involved in imaging of partial oxygen pressure and temperature, the fundamentals of the design of pressure and temperature <b>sensitive</b> <b>paints.</b> It also summarizes the effects of luminescence quenching by oxygen and temperature together with the respective equations. An overview of materials used in such pressure <b>sensitive</b> <b>paints</b> (PSPs) and temperature <b>sensitive</b> <b>paints</b> (TSPs) is given, this is followed by an explanation of various methods for the readout of such paints together with a description of the hardware needed and used for those methods. These methods of readout are compared in terms of standard deviation, lateral signal homogeneity and resolution in Chapter 3. The advantages and disadvantages of the different techniques also are discussed, especially for lifetime imaging and RGB color camera imaging. Referenced intensity imaging is another method of readout. This method utilizes a reference dye which is insensitive towards the analyte or displays a different sensitivity compared to the indicator dye. In Chapter 4 such reference dyes are characterized, calibrated and compared. A general problem in dually <b>sensitive</b> <b>paints</b> is the separation of two luminescent signals. The spectral overlap of the emissions of two indicators should be a small as possible. Most established indicators for pO 2 and temperature display red emission. Therefore, new complexes that have not yet been evaluated for indicator purposes were searched for and investigated. Chapter 5 is dealing with homoleptic and heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes with respect to their ability as pressure or temperature indicator. The complexes are calibrated via lifetime imaging and the results are compared. They provide blue to green emission which is separable from red emitting indicators. The best temperature indicator and the best pressure (oxygen) indicator amongst them were combined to demonstrate the applicability in a dually <b>sensitive</b> <b>paint</b> which is described in Chapter 6. The composition, the separation of the two luminescent signals, and the calibration of this dual paint is described in detail. One of the iridium(III) complexes evaluated above was applied in a dually <b>sensitive</b> <b>paint</b> base on water instead of organic solvents (see Chapter 7). It is the first dually <b>sensitive</b> <b>paint</b> working like emulsion paint. The preparation and calibration of this material is described in detail. Cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes were found to be fairly unstudied in terms of indicator applications. The applicability of various Pt(II) complexes is investigated in Chapter 8. The spectra of the compounds and the sensitivity of their luminescence lifetime towards oxygen and temperature were measured and compared. The performance of PtTFPP for sensing air pressure in the range of atmospheric pressure was mot surpassed by any of the investigated dyes. The temperature indicator has to display blue to green emission if applied together with PtTFPP in a dually <b>sensitive</b> <b>paint.</b> The aim of further research should be the discovery of blue to green emitting temperature indicators with improved temperature resolution. The emission of one of the cyclometalated Pt(II) dyes is not only temperature dependent and separable from the red PtTFPP, it also matches the green channel of a RGB color camera. Based on the results of Chapter 4 and Chapter 8, the first dually <b>sensitive</b> <b>paint</b> appropriate for color camera read out was prepared. This novel material is specified in Chapter 9. Its oxygen and temperature response was calibrated. The standard deviation, the influence of inhomogeneous illumination and the resolution was determined...|$|R

40|$|The current {{pressure}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>paint</b> (PSP) technique {{assumes a}} linear relationship (Stern-Volmer Equation) between intensity ratio (I(sub 0) /I) and pressure ratio (P/P(sub 0)) {{over a wide}} range of pressures (vacuum to ambient or higher). Although this may be valid for some PSPs, in most PSPs the relationship is nonlinear, particularly at low pressures (less than 0. 2 psia when the oxygen level is low). This non-linearity can be attributed to variations in the oxygen quenching (de-activation) rates (which otherwise is assumed constant) at these pressures. Other studies suggest that some paints also have non-linear calibrations at high pressures; because of heterogeneous (non-uniform) oxygen diffusion and c quenching. Moreover, pressure <b>sensitive</b> <b>paints</b> require correction for the output intensity due to light intensity variation, paint coating variation, model dynamics, wind-off reference pressure variation, and temperature sensitivity. Therefore to minimize the measurement uncertainties due to these causes, an in- situ intensity correction method was developed. A non-oxygen quenched paint (which provides a constant intensity at all pressures, called non-pressure <b>sensitive</b> <b>paint,</b> NPSP) was used for the reference intensity (I(sub NPSP)) with respect to which all the PSP intensities (I) were measured.
