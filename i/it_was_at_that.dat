5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{became known}} to Western scholars {{as a result}} of correspondence between Erasmus and the prefects of the Vatican Library. Portions of the codex were collated by several scholars, but numerous errors were made during this process. The Codex's relationship to the Latin Vulgate was unclear and scholars were initially unaware of the Codex's value. This changed in the 19th century when transcriptions of the full codex were completed. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> point that scholars realised the text differed significantly from the Textus Receptus.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{leaving the}} Army, Carradine became serious about his acting pursuits. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> {{time that he}} was advised to change his name to avoid {{confusion}} with his famous father. In 1963, he made his television debut on an episode of Armstrong Circle Theatre. Several other television roles were to follow including appearances on Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. He made his feature film debut in 1964 in Taggart, a western based on a novel by Louis L'Amour.|$|E
5|$|Pronovost {{appeared}} in 70 {{games for the}} Maple Leafs in 1967–68 and recorded 20 points, but he was held to only 34 games the following season. He missed {{the majority of the}} season to injury, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time that Maple Leafs president Conn Stafford Smythe suggested Pronovost should be installed as a player-coach of one of Toronto's minor league affiliates. He was offered a position with the Tulsa Oilers of the Central Hockey League (CHL), and though initially reluctant to go, the Oilers organization was able to convince Pronovost and his wife to move to the Oklahoma city. He played and coached for much of the year in Tulsa, but was briefly recalled back to Toronto part way through the 1969–70 NHL season. He recorded one assist in seven games with Toronto, the last of his NHL career.|$|E

50|$|During {{the second}} quarter of the 12th century, the old bell-tower-porch which was on the {{frontage}} was removed and the church was increased by two spans towards the west.

5|$|The {{idea for}} a Linguistic Institute was first {{proposed}} {{in the spring of}} 1927 by Reinhold Saleski. The fledgling Society was hesitant at first, but Edgar Sturtevant was keen on the idea. Sturtevant molded Saleski's idea into a model still used today: a gathering of scholars in conjunction with coursework. The Executive Committee voted to authorize the first Linguistic Institute, to be held 1928, along with authorization for a second institute in 1929. After the fourth Institute in 1931, the program took a four-year hiatus due to the great depression. Institutes were held every year concurrently with summer meetings of the LSA until 1988 when, due to increasing costs, the Society announced that the Linguistic Institutes would be held every other year. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> same time that the summer meeting of the LSA was also discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The listed {{buildings}} can {{be divided}} by date into three groups: ancient structures, structures built during the two centuries before the Industrial Revolution, and those built during or after it. Halton Castle and Norton Priory date from the 11th and 12thcenturies, and are now in ruins. Structures built before the Industrial Revolution reflect society as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time, and the main occupations of farming and fishing. They include farmhouses, such as the building known as the Seneschal's House, which dates from 1598 and is the oldest standing building in the urban area; buildings relating to stately homes, such as the loggia and ice house in the grounds of Norton Priory; domestic buildings, such as Halton Old Hall, and buildings relating to the church, such as Halton Vicarage and the adjacent Chesshyre Library.|$|E
5|$|The {{program began}} in 1984 as the Advanced Operational Studies Fellowship (AOSF) by {{diverting}} lieutenant colonel War College selectees to Fort Leavenworth for an equivalent education program. The AOSF program had students completing the AMSP coursework, and then {{serving as the}} principal instructors of AMSP during their second year. In 1995, {{the name of the}} program was changed to the Advanced Operational Art Studies Fellowship (AOASF), and in the early 21st century its curriculum was more closely aligned to the strategic level of war. In 2013, the program was again modified in part to bring it more in alignment with TRADOC policies, and to prepare it for Joint Professional Education II accreditation. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time renamed the Advanced Strategic Leadership Studies Program (ASLSP).|$|E

50|$|Ever {{since its}} reconquest from the Ostrogoths by Belisarius in 535-536, Sicily {{had formed a}} {{distinct}} province under a praetor, while the army was placed under a dux.

25|$|During later {{periods of}} the Iraq War Georgia had up to 2,000 {{soldiers}} {{serving in the}} Multi-National Force. Georgia also participated in the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.

Over 11,000 Georgian soldiers have been rotated through Afghanistan. , 31 Georgian servicemen have died in Afghanistan, most during the Helmand campaign, and 435 were wounded, including 35 amputees.|$|E
25|$|The Norwegian sealing vessel Spidsbergen with captain Nils Fredrik Rønnbeck and harpooner Johan Petter Aidijärvi aboard sailed {{northeast}} from Svalbard in 1865 {{in search}} of suitable sealing sites and found an archipelago that was most likely Franz Josef Land. They named the area Nord-Øst Spidsbergen (Northeast Spitsbergen) or Rønnebeck Land. However, an announcement of the discovery was never made and the archipelago remained unknown until the following expedition. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time common to keep newly discovered areas secret to avoid competition for sealing and whaling from other vessels.|$|E

25|$|In another lawsuit, Wayne Ritchie, {{a former}} United States Marshal, after {{hearing about the}} project's {{existence}} in 1990, alleged the CIA laced his food or drink with LSD at a 1957 Christmas party which resulted in his attempting to commit a robbery at a bar and his subsequent arrest. While the government admitted <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time, drugging people without their consent, U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel found Ritchie could not prove {{he was one of}} the victims of MKUltra or that LSD caused his robbery attempt and dismissed the case in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Because of Thessaloniki's {{importance}} {{during the}} early Christian and Byzantine periods, the city is host to several paleochristian monuments that have significantly contributed {{to the development of}} Byzantine art and architecture throughout the Byzantine Empire as well as Serbia. The evolution of Imperial Byzantine architecture and the prosperity of Thessaloniki go hand in hand, especially during {{the first years of the}} Empire, when the city continued to flourish. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time that the Complex of Roman emperor Galerius was built, as well as the first church of Hagios Demetrios.|$|E
25|$|In September 2001, Joe Sillett {{was hunting}} {{in his garage}} for a bat ahead of a Sunday match for his club side Brook in Surrey versus The Zombies. The only one he could find had {{a bad case of}} woodworm, and to repair the damage, Joe's father Bob carved out small curves towards the top of the bat, {{finishing}} it by hand and a Black and Decker power sander. In the match, using his oddly shaped bat, he scored 142 not out, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> point Joe decided to found The Woodworm Cricket Company, with its now famous shaped bats.|$|E
50|$|After the 1994 {{elections}} and the 1994 split, momentum grew to unify the FMLN into a single organization without separate internal parties. In 1995, the five parties that had formed the FMLN dissolved themselves. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> point that the FPL, CP, ERP, RN and PRTC ceased to exist, and what remained was a unified FMLN. Then people could join the FMLN directly {{instead of having to}} join one of its component parties. While this decision liquidated the parallel organizational structures inside the FMLN, there still remained strong loyalties along historic organizational lines, some of which can still be seen today.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> {{time that}} the artist begins {{producing}} artistic integrations within the architecture of public buildings. 'Green Velvet' in the Children's Psychiatric wing of the UZ Jette and 'Landscape' in Saint Agatha Berchem, in a children's day car center are both good examples of this. In both works, several universes intermingle. An abstracted landscape reconstructs in a public space. In a very urbanized environment, this becomes a landmark, an oasis for young residents.|$|R

25|$|Most of the Greco-Roman alchemists {{preceding}} Zosimos {{are known}} only by pseudonyms, such as Moses, Isis, Cleopatra, Democritus, and Ostanes. Others authors such as Komarios, and Chymes, we only know through fragments of text. After 400, Greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in {{commenting on the}} works of these predecessors. By {{the middle of the}} 7th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time that Khalid Ibn Yazid sparked its migration from Alexandria to the Islamic world, facilitating the translation and preservation of Greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries.|$|E
25|$|These hardships made young Kedarnath {{question}} {{the meaning of}} life and ponder over reasons for human sufferings. He felt unconvinced by conventional explanations and started doubting the reality of the many Hindu gods and goddesses worshiped in village temples. Exposed to contradictory views ranging from religious beliefs to tantric practices, exorcism, superstitions and avid atheism, Kedarnath found himself in a state of disappointment and philosophical confusion. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time that an encounter with a simple old woman who advised him to chant the name of Rama that unexpectedly made a profound impact on him, planting the seed of Vaishnava faith that he maintained throughout his life.|$|E
25|$|After Señorans departure, women regained their {{positions}} in the civil intelligence community, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time, {{with the onset of}} the Cold War, that the CIA began taking special interest in SIDE. The growth of communist groups and guerrillas in Latin America, backed by Fidel Castro's regime, as well as the special interest the Soviet Union began to take in Latin America, made the American intelligence community influence what was then thought as an area of minor concern to American interests in the war. The Secretariat of Intelligence was no exception, the 'communist problem' was made a priority, and surveillance of foreign embassies and delegations of communist countries became common.|$|E
