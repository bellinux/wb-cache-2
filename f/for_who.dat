5|$|A {{vignette}} in the two-part series Divided We Stand {{explored the}} after-effects of Anole's numerous traumatic experiences at the Xavier Institute during {{his return to}} his hometown. Northstar, now rehabilitated, is contacted by Cyclops to find Anole, who goes into hiding after accidentally attacking his own father due to posttraumatic stress disorder from his experiences at the Xavier Institute. Northstar discovers Anole at his tree house, unhappy to see his former mentor. At first, Northstar makes jokes, thinking Anole is having a problem with fitting in as both a mutant and as a gay teen. Anole explains that his town accepts him <b>for</b> <b>who</b> he is and that his problems come from Northstar, {{along with the other}} X-Men, for providing the students under their care with a poor education, stealing their innocence by constantly exposing them to danger, and then throwing them away by disbanding. Planning to run away, Anole leaves a note for his parents at the tree house and elbows Northstar in the face—similar to how Northstar attacked him in the past—and tells him to tell all of the former New X-Men not to come looking for him.|$|E

5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him <b>for</b> <b>who</b> he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem {{lies in the fact that}} every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been hurt, or betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E
5|$|Glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has {{the club}} split up into pairs to sing ballads to one another. As Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton) is absent, Will {{is forced to}} take his place and sing with Rachel (Lea Michele), who develops a crush on him. Will is dismayed, remembering Suzy Pepper (Sarah Drew), the last student who had such strong feelings for him. When her feelings were not reciprocated, she was so distraught she ate an extremely hot pepper from Mexico, was hospitalized, and had to have an esophagus transplant. Rachel visits Will's apartment, where his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) puts her to work cooking and cleaning. After an encounter with Suzy Pepper, during which Suzy explains {{that the two of them}} are similar and that chasing after Will won't repair Rachel's self-esteem, Rachel realizes her feelings for Will reflect her concerns about her own self-worth, and apologizes for her behavior. Afterward, Will assures her that she will find the man of her dreams who loves her <b>for</b> <b>who</b> she is.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) are {{suspicious}} that Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) new boyfriend Paul (Will Forte) is using her. Pete and Liz follow Paul {{to a bar}} and find out {{that he is a}} Jenna Maroney impersonator, performing as her in a drag show. The next day, Liz asks Jenna if she knows what Paul does, but Jenna is aware of his work, having met Paul at a Jenna Maroney impersonator contest in which he won and Jenna herself placed fourth. Liz does not approve of the relationship and confronts Paul, asking what his intentions are with Jenna. Paul tells her that he is not using Jenna to further his career, but that he is with her because she accepts him <b>for</b> <b>who</b> he is. Liz is convinced by their touching (although weird) display of care for each other, ultimately approving of their relationship.|$|E

Homer sneaks her back into Springfield one night under the {{disguise}} of Mr. Burns and Smithers, and they spend the night getting drunk and subsequently having drunken sex in their old abandoned home. However, Chief Wiggum sees through their disguises, and rallies the people of Springfield to the Simpson home to capture Homer and Marge. Marge is initially angry at the members of the mob, but she stuns them by saying that she does not want to live in Springfield or deal with them anymore, having found a place to live where she and her family can be accepted <b>for</b> <b>who</b> they are and love each other without worry of hate and judgment from others. Marge and Homer march through the visibly disillusioned crowd and return to The Outlands. Back in the Simpsons' new home, Bart discovers Lenny and Carl sneaking in. They tell the family they long to start a new life in The Outlands. Soon, Moe, Mayor Quimby, and many other Springfield residents show up, wishing to abandon their lives in Springfield and start over in The Outlands. Soon, all of Springfield moves there to start new lives with the Simpsons, and they begin rebuilding a new city which they name Springfield.|$|E

5|$|In this series, the Clan’s {{survival}} is {{put at risk}} as humans begin to destroy the forest with machinery. To combat this, one cat from all four Clan’s is chosen to journey and find a new home for the cats to live. These cats are Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowpaw of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, the latter of whom also struggles with his heritage as the late Tigerstar’s son. Feathertail’s brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw also accompany them. After a long journey, the group discover a lake {{that they can use}} as their new territory, which they name ‘sun-drown-place.’ Whilst journeying back to report their finding to the Clans, the travelling cats meet a new community called The Tribe of Rushing Water, who are being terrorized by a mountain lion. Feathertail sacrifices her life to kill the mountain lion and save the Tribe. The remaining cats return to their Clans and relay the message. Together, the four Clans travel to their new territory, although many cats perish along the way. During this journey, the boundaries between the Clans begin to blur. Crowfeather (formerly Crowpaw) falls in love with the ThunderClan medicine cat Leafpool; however, as they are from different Clans, they are forbidden from being together. Additionally, Leafpool’s status as a medicine cat dictates she can never have a mate or give birth to kits. They decide to secretly run away together, but return when the ThunderClan camp is attacked by badgers. Leafpool’s mentor, Cinderpelt, dies in the battle, and Leafpool decides that she must remain with her Clan. Meanwhile, Brambleclaw is torn between his loyalty to his Clan and his loyalty to his dead father. He dreams of one day becoming Clan deputy, an ambition that is heightened when he discovers that his father, Tigerstar, can visit him in his dreams. Furthermore, Brambleclaw learns that he has a RiverClan half-brother named Hawkfrost. The two grow close, much to the disdain of Squirrelflight (formerly Squirrelpaw). However, Hawkfrost’s bloodthirsty nature is revealed when he traps the ThunderClan leader Firestar, and orders Brambleclaw to murder him. Brambleclaw instead kills Hawkfrost. In return, Firestar accepts the young warrior <b>for</b> <b>who</b> he is, and Brambleclaw is appointed the new deputy of ThunderClan. He later begins a relationship with Squirrelflight.|$|E
