The author notes that bacon is not as bad nutritionally as had previously been thought. He compares the nutritional characteristics of two slices of cooked bacon to one pork hot dog, noting that the bacon contains approximately [...] "73 calories, 202 milligrams of sodium, 6 <b>grams</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> and 11 milligrams of cholesterol", while the hot dog has [...] "182 calories, 638 milligrams of sodium, 17 <b>grams</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> and 29 milligrams of cholesterol". [...] "If health concerns sometimes make you feel guilty about loving bacon ... relax ...yes, it’s high in sodium and fat, but if eaten in moderation or used as a flavoring agent ... it is a guilt free indulgence," [...] writes Villas. Breakfast dishes include French Cheese and Bacon souffle, and Bacon Scrapple. A recipe for BLT sandwich is included in the section on sandwiches, but the majority of Villas's other sandwich recipes are more extreme, and include ingredients such as Jamaican smoked fish. Dishes that contain vegetables include Lima Bean and Bacon Casserole; and Spanish Chicken, Bacon, Meatball and Chickpea Stew. For dessert, Villas includes six recipes such as bacon-wrapped figs, and Bacon and Peanut Butter Chocolate Truffles, and Portuguese Egg and Bacon Pudding.|$|E
500|$|Dale Keown's {{comic book}} artwork of the Hulk was an {{inspiration}} for his design. Leterrier felt the first Hulk had [...] "too much fat [...] the proportions were a little off". He explained, [...] "The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero <b>grams</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat,</b> all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank." [...] Visual effects supervisor Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a linebacker rather than a bodybuilder. A height of nine feet was chosen for the character as {{they did not want}} him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited flushing as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions. The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an olive or even gray slate. His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for The Avengers film. The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on Mike Deodato's art. He originally had a crew cut, but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character. Leterrier cited An American Werewolf in London as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change. As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms. Leterrier changed the Abomination's design from the comics because he felt the audience would question why he resembled a fish or a reptile, instead of [...] "an über-human" [...] like the Hulk. Rather, his hideousness is derived from being injected multiple times into his skin, muscles and bones; creating a creature with a protruding spine and sharp bones that he can use to stab. His green skin is pale, and reflects light, so it appears orange because of surrounding fire during the climactic battle. The motion capture performers, including Roth, tried to make the character behave less gracefully than the Hulk. They modeled his posture and the way he turns his head on a shark. The character also shares Roth's tattoos. A height of eleven feet was chosen for the character. Leterrier tried to work in the character's pointed ears, but realized the Hulk would bite them off (using the example of Mike Tyson when he fought Evander Holyfield), and felt ignoring that would make the Hulk come across as stupid.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Pancreatic enzyme {{replacement}} therapy (PERT) is the proven therapy to substantially reduce fat malabsorption {{in patients with}} cystic fibrosis (CF). Few details of the daily practice regarding PERT and the resulting coefficient <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> absorption (CFA) are known. We therefore recorded the PERT and CFA in a large cohort of pancreatic insufficient pediatric patients with CF. Methods: We retrospectively studied 1719 completed 3 -day dietary food records, including the pancreatic enzyme intake registrations, and 1373 CFA assessments of 224 patients with CF, ages 0 - 17 years. The clinical characteristics, PERT, expressed as an intake of lipase unit (LU) per <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> per day and LU per kilogram per day, and the CFA were described for {{the group as a}} whole and separately for those on enteral tube feeding. Cross-sectional relationship between the CFA and the LU per <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> per day and LU per kilogram per day were determined for each year of age. We also addressed the effect of the interventions done in patients with CFA outcomes Results: The LU per <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> per day was relatively stable throughout the age groups, whereas the LU per kilogram per day fell markedly with age. The median CFA in the age group 17 varied between 86 % and 91 %, however, with a CFA below 85 % in 325 of 1373 (24 %) of the measurements. No relationship was found between PERT and CFA. The patients with persistent CFA less than 85 % had significant lower z scores weight for age and weight for height (P = 0. 01) than those with CFA at least 85 %. Conclusions: In this study population, no correlation between an enzyme dosage and the degree <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> malabsorption was found; however, a CFA below 85 % was found in 24 % of the measurements...|$|R
40|$|Elevated dioxin {{levels in}} eggs have been {{reported}} in Germany and the Netherlands. The maximum level laid down in Regulation (EC) No. 1881 / 2006 for dioxins of 3 picograms WHO-PCDD/F-TEQ per <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> and for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs of 6 picograms WHO-PCDD/F-PCB-TEQ per <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> was exceeded in some of the samples analysed by official controls. From the perspective of food legislation, these products are therefore not marketable. Dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are environmental contaminants that humans mainly take in through foods of animal origin. Because dioxins and PCBs are stored in the fatty tissue of humans where they also accumulate, the daily intake amount should be minimised as much as possible. The dioxin concentrations that were found do not constitute an acute health hazard for consumers. The consumption of such contaminated eggs over {{a short period of time}} is not expected to have adverse effects on health. For reasons of preventive consumer protection, however, PCB and dioxin contamination should be minimised as much as possible. In this respect, unnecessary and avoidable additional exposure is not acceptable...|$|R
