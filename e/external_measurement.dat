6000|$|I have {{previously}} remarked that, {{if we had}} possessed many domestic rabbits of the same average size with the wild rabbit, {{it would have been}} easy to compare the capacity of their skulls. Now the Himalayan, Moscow, and Angora rabbits (Nos. 11, 12, 13 of Table 3) are only a little larger in body and have skulls only a little longer, than the wild animal, and we see that the actual capacity of their skulls is less than in the wild animal, and considerably less by calculation (column 7), according to the difference in the length of their skulls. The narrowness of the brain-case in these three rabbits could be plainly seen and proved by <b>external</b> <b>measurement.</b> The Chinchilla rabbit (No. 14) is a considerably larger animal than the wild rabbit, yet the capacity of its skull only slightly exceeds that of the wild rabbit. The Angora rabbit, No. 13, offers the most remarkable case; this animal in its pure white colour and length of silky fur bears the stamp of long domesticity. It has a considerably longer head and body than the wild rabbit, but the actual capacity of its skull is less than that of even the little wild Porto Santo rabbits. By the standard of the length of skull the capacity (see column 7) is only half of what it ought to have been! I kept this individual animal alive, and it was not unhealthy nor idiotic. This case of the Angora rabbit so much surprised me, that I repeated all the measurements and found them correct. I have also compared the capacity of the skull of the Angora with that of the wild rabbit by other standards, namely, by the length and weight of the body, and by the weight of the limb-bones; but by all these standards the brain appears to be much too small, though in a less degree when the standard of the limb- bones was used; and this latter circumstance may probably be accounted for by the limbs of this anciently domesticated breed having become much reduced in weight, from its long-continued inactive life. Hence I infer that in the Angora breed, which is said to differ from other breeds in being quieter and more social, the capacity of the skull has really undergone a remarkable amount of reduction.] ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{with the fall}} of the Gang of Four and the start Era of Reconstruction, there was a new {{openness}} in Chinese society. The practice of qigong spread from an institutional setting to a popular movement led by charismatic promoters. Guo Lin (郭林), a Beijing artist who claimed to have cured herself of uterine cancer in the 1960s, {{was one of the first}} qigong masters to teach qigong openly to the general public outside an institutional setting. Scientists, free from the repression of the Cultural Revolution, were able to seek new challenges. Among the new subjects of inquiry, they studied the effects of qigong and provided scientific foundations for qigong practice. In 1979, Gu Hansen of the Shanghai Institute of Atomic Research first reported on the <b>external</b> <b>measurement</b> of qi. This research proved to be critical in promoting the notion of a scientific basis for qigong. Other reports of external evidence of qi quickly followed. Other forms of measurements, personal testimonies on the effectiveness of qigong treatment and demonstration of the uses of qigong found in the martial arts were used to illustrate the practical realities of the qigong.|$|E

Yang from Google Inc. to accurately estimate power estimation online for Smartphones. [...] PowerBooter is an automated power model that uses built-in battery voltage sensors and behavior of battery during discharge to monitor power consumption of total system. This method doesn’t require any especial <b>external</b> <b>measurement</b> equipment. PowerTutor is also a power measurement tool that uses PowerBooter generated data for online power estimation. There is always a limitation in Smartphone technology battery life span that HW and SW designers need to overcome. Software designers don’t always have the best knowledge of power consumption to design better power optimized applications therefore end users always blame the battery lifespan. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for a tool that has the capability to measure power consumption on Smartphones that software designers could use to monitor their applications in real-time. Researchers have developed specific power management models for specific portable embedded systems and it takes a huge effort to reuse those models for a vast variety of modern Smartphone technology. So the solution to this problem is PowerBooter model that can estimate real-time power consumption for individual Smartphone subsystems such as CPU, LCD, GPS, audio, Wi-Fi and cell phone communication components. Along with PowerBooter model an on-line PowerTutor utility can use the generated data to determine the subsystem level power consumption. The model and PowerTutor utility can be used across different platforms and Smartphone technologies.|$|E

40|$|Montane and Long-tailed voles (Microtus montanus and Microtus longicaudus) are {{notoriously}} {{difficult to distinguish}} through <b>external</b> characteristics and <b>measurements</b> in the field, particularly among juveniles. Being able to accurate identify these species is important, due to their central role in ecosystems (as keystone species) and as indicator species of climate change (due to their high sensitivity to climate change). The present study assessed three methods for distinguishing the two species: cranial (skull-based) and <b>external</b> <b>measurements,</b> the presence of additional skull characteristics, and DNA sequencing through examining 372 specimens in the University of Colorado Natural History Museum collection and 52 specimen from recent collection by the McCain lab (2010 - 2011).

40|$|Publisher's copy made {{available}} {{with the permission}} of the publisherIt has been suggested that the appropriate length of insertion for double-lumen tubes can be estimated by <b>external</b> <b>measurement.</b> This study examined the accuracy of <b>external</b> <b>measurement</b> in estimating the actual length of insertion required in 130 patients. It also examined the relationship between the length inserted and the patient’s height in 126 patients and their weight in 125 patients. Although there was a fair correlation between the measured external length and the final inserted length (r= 0. 61), the 95 % confidence intervals of slope and intercept allowed a large variation and the prediction was too wide to be clinically useful. Height was reasonably well correlated with the final length (r= 0. 51) but an equally wide 95 % confidence interval rendered it of little clinical value. There was no correlation between weight and final tube length. It is concluded that <b>external</b> <b>measurement</b> alone is not adequate to predict a clinically acceptable position of the double-lumen tube. R. A. Dyer, S. A. M. Heijke, W. J. Russell, M. B.

40|$|Within the newt genus Triturus, the large-bodied {{species in}} the T. cristatus (crested newt) {{superspecies}} show an unusual degree of variation in relative trunk length {{as a result of}} among-taxon variation in interlimb vertebral count. Here we examine the systematic value of this feature as assessed by both exterior measurement (Wolterstorff Index) and direct radiographic count of rib-bearing vertebrae, with particular reference to a number of confounding factors (sex differences, hybridisation, geographic variation, allometry, preservation effects). Using our mtDNA haplotype data, which are largely concordant with geographic distribution of species, we find that direct count of the rib-bearing vertebrae performs more reliably (14 % misclassification) than <b>external</b> <b>measurement</b> (31 % misclassification) as a species identifier. We therefore recommend this feature as a taxonomic tool, although (like <b>external</b> <b>measurement)</b> it breaks down near hybrid zones.
