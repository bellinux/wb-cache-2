5|$|Following the {{testimony}} of Seymour, Power, and Williams, it became clear the jury could not convict Williams based on witness testimony alone. There was, however, some circumstantial evidence: an empty <b>holster</b> found by the police among Williams' possessions showed evidence of a revolver recently being inside it. The police enlisted the aid of {{an expert in the}} new science of forensic ballistics, Robert Churchill; {{it was one of the}} first times the police made use of ballistics in a case.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} a relief company, from the 1st Battalion of the Kumaon Regiment, reached Badgam, the {{position}} held by Sharma's company had been overrun. However, the 200 casualties suffered by the tribal infiltrators caused them to lose the impetus to advance. This bought time for Indian forces to fly into Srinagar airfield and block all routes of ingress to Srinagar itself. During the battle, along with Sharma, one junior commissioned officer and 20 other ranks of D company were killed. Sharma's body was recovered three days later. Though it was disfigured beyond recognition, his body was identified {{by means of the}} leather <b>holster</b> of his pistol and a few pages of Bhagavad Gita in his breast pocket.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, Lamason {{was among}} a group of 168 allied airmen from Great Britain, United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Jamaica who -- along with over 2,500 French prisoners -- were taken by train—in overcrowded cattle boxcars — from Fresnes Prison outside Paris, to Buchenwald {{concentration}} camp. As the airmen were herded into the boxcars, Lamason protested about the poor treatment of the airmen, only to be struck in the face by a SS guard. Lamason fell to the ground and captured pilot Roy Allen watched as a SS Major pulled a Luger from his <b>holster</b> and thought Lamason would be shot on the spot. After five days travel, during which the airmen received very little food or water, they arrived at Buchenwald on 20 August 1944.|$|E
50|$|Sporting <b>holsters</b> cover a wide {{spectrum}} of styles: maximum access for fast draw shooting, highly adjustable <b>holsters</b> used in IPSC and pin shooting, old-fashioned <b>holsters</b> used in Cowboy Action Shooting, high retention, maximum protection <b>holsters</b> used for handgun hunting, and simple <b>holsters</b> used to hold a handgun while out plinking. Like any sporting equipment, sporting <b>holsters</b> evolve to maximize the benefits given the rules of the game, where applicable, so the competitive sports have the most specialized <b>holsters.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Chest <b>holsters</b> can be {{attached}} to MOLLE compatible vests and chest carriers. Like shoulder <b>holsters,</b> chest <b>holsters</b> are often easier to draw from than belt <b>holsters</b> when the operator is seated inside a vehicle.|$|R
50|$|<b>Holsters</b> can {{be divided}} into four broad {{categories}} by use: duty <b>holsters,</b> worn by uniformed law enforcement and peace officers and security personnel; tactical <b>holsters,</b> worn by military, security, and law enforcement personnel in certain situations; concealment <b>holsters,</b> worn by plainclothes peace officers and private persons; and sporting <b>holsters,</b> worn for shooting sports and hunting.|$|R
5|$|Halo {{departs from}} {{traditional}} FPS conventions by not forcing the player character to <b>holster</b> its firearm before deploying grenades or melee-range blunt instruments; instead, both attacks can be utilized while a gun is still equipped, supplanting or supplementing small-arms fire. All weapons {{may be used}} to bludgeon enemies, which allows Master Chief to silently kill opponents without alerting other nearby enemies. The Chief can also carry up to eight grenades at a time: up to four fragmentation and four plasma grenades each. Like the game's other weapons, the two types of grenades differ; the fragmentation grenade bounces and detonates quickly, whereas the plasma grenade adheres to targets before exploding, sometimes with blackly comic results.|$|E
5|$|Ike Clanton, who {{had been}} {{threatening}} to kill the Earps for several months, including the day before, and Billy Claiborne were both unarmed. They ran from the fight unhurt. Wesley Fuller, a Cowboy {{who had been}} {{at the rear of the}} lot, left as soon as the firing began. Both Wyatt and Virgil believed Tom McLaury was armed and testified that he had fired at least one shot over the back of a horse. Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury exchanged gunfire with the lawmen. During the gunfight, Doc Holliday was bruised by a bullet fired by Frank that struck his <b>holster</b> and grazed his hip. Virgil Earp was shot through the calf, he thought by Billy Clanton. Morgan Earp was struck across both shoulder blades by a bullet that Morgan thought Frank McLaury had fired. Wyatt Earp was unhurt. Tom McLaury, his brother Frank, and Billy Clanton were killed.|$|E
5|$|Qwak! was {{released}} in a standard upright arcade cabinet with {{a black and white}} raster television monitor inset, with the rifle <b>holster</b> and start button below as the only controls. The reeds and tree branch overlay is screen printed in color onto a clear panel in front of the monitor, and is backlit by the screen; the screen is lit with a gray background instead of a black one in order to produce this effect. When the gun is triggered, the duck additionally flashes white briefly, so as to be detected by the light gun; the relative brightness of the screen makes this effect less obvious than with other similar light gun games. Qwak! was not the first light gun video game; it was preceded by the arcade game Balloon Gun (August 1974) and a light gun game for the Magnavox Odyssey video game console (1972), as well as non-video game light gun games since the 1936 Seeberg Ray-O-Lite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Holsters</b> are {{generally}} {{attached to a}} person's belt or waistband or clipped to another article of clothing. Some <b>holsters,</b> such as ankle <b>holsters,</b> have integrated support. Other <b>holsters</b> may fit inside a pocket, to add stability and protection to the handgun, keeping it more reliably secure and accessible than if it were in the pocket alone.|$|R
50|$|There is some {{overlap between}} duty <b>holsters,</b> {{tactical}} <b>holsters,</b> and military <b>holsters.</b> Weapon retention {{is generally not}} as important a consideration in military use {{as it is in}} law enforcement due to the differences in their work environments.|$|R
50|$|Duty <b>holsters</b> are {{designed}} to be carried openly, so concealment is not an issue, but retention and appearance are. Duty <b>holsters</b> can be made of leather (plain, basketweave, or glossy), nylon, or plastic; they {{are designed}} to be attached to a duty belt, and worn on the dominant side. Duty <b>holsters</b> are generally only found for service and compact size handguns as opposed to small subcompact handguns as these are generally only used for concealed carry backup guns.|$|R

25|$|The Resident Evil Shot Blaster is a {{replacement}} to the Wii Zapper. The gun {{comes with a}} detachable Nunchuk <b>holster.</b> The <b>holster</b> also rotates downward to allow easy reloading for in the game. When the nunchuk <b>holster</b> is removed the gun becomes something like a pistol. The package also includes a decal that you can put on your Wii Remote which has a picture of characters from the game on it, and a Nunchuk joystick grip which has the logo of the Umbrella Corporation on it.|$|E
25|$|Pre-World War II Type 14s {{are well}} made, with quality {{dropping}} during wartime. Machining marks, {{a lack of}} polishing, and thin bluing became more common as wartime shortages affected quality. The later Type 14s remained quite functional despite the decreased quality. <b>Holster</b> quality for the Type 14 also degraded as the shortages of critical raw materials forced a change from a leather <b>holster</b> to rubberized canvas.|$|E

50|$|There {{are seven}} <b>holsters</b> for Point of View Guns inside Deep Thought, {{but only one}} actual gun. The rest of the <b>holsters</b> are empty. At {{the end of the}} movie Arthur Dent {{possesses}} the gun, and Zaphod has not yet turned the gun over to Humma Kavula.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>holsters</b> are {{typically}} made from fairly stiff yet tough materials, {{there are a}} limited number of common choices. The traditional material, particularly for handgun <b>holsters,</b> is leather. It has an attractive appearance and can be dyed in many colors and/or embossed with elaborate designs for cosmetic reasons.|$|R
25|$|In the 2007 film, Charlie Prince carries two Smith & Wesson Schofield Model 3 revolvers in butts-forward {{holsters}} {{built by}} Will Ghormley. Ghormley also designed Prince's holsters. Thell Reed extensively trained Foster in multiple quick draw and spinning techniques prior to filming. The Schofields {{were also used}} by Wade to kill Prince. Thell, the armorer, felt the arched back in the holsters impeded Foster’s ability to draw. Ultimately the arches were removed {{even though they were}} period correct. Also the holsters on the final rig were made ‘baggier’ than the <b>holster</b> on the prototype so Foster could <b>holster</b> his pistols with less resistance. However, in the 1957 film, he used a Colt Peacemaker.|$|E
25|$|Holsters {{supplied}} with the Hamada type pistol were usually made of cowhide leather and contained black metal closure fasteners. Because the Hamada pistol has a long, nine cartridge magazine, the <b>holster</b> of similar weapons like the Browning Model 1910 will not properly contain the Hamada pistol.|$|E
25|$|With the {{evidence}} apparently destroyed or suitably confused, the family {{believe they have}} saved Gerda. There is a final clue: the <b>holster</b> in which the murder weapon was kept.

25|$|Until the 1970s, when older-design revolvers such as Colt Single Action Armys and Ruger Blackhawks were {{re-engineered}} with drop safeties (such as {{firing pin}} blocks, hammer blocks, or transfer bars) that prevent {{the firing pin}} from contacting the cartridge's primer unless the trigger is pulled, safe carry required the hammer being positioned over an empty chamber, reducing the available cartridges from six to five, or, on some models, in between chambers on either a pin or in a groove for that purpose, thus keeping the full six rounds available. This kept the uncocked hammer from resting directly on the primer of a cartridge. If not used in this manner, the hammer rests directly on a primer and unintentional firing may occur if the gun is dropped or the hammer is struck. Some <b>holster</b> makers provided a thick leather thong to place underneath the hammer that both allowed the carry of a gun fully loaded with all six rounds and secured the gun in the <b>holster</b> to help prevent its accidental loss.|$|E
25|$|It was {{a police}} car version of the Gallardo LP560-4 coupé for the Italian State Police, with a camera {{recording}} system featuring a camera beside the rear view mirror, GPS navigation, a gun <b>holster,</b> a police radio, a Paletta warning sign, a portable screen, a refrigerator and defibrillator in the front cargo compartment, blu Polizia body colour, a police beacon with blue LEDs at the vehicle's front, roof, side, and rear.|$|E
25|$|Equipment {{is carried}} by {{officers}} in a nylon equipment belt, {{also known as}} a gun or weapon belt. The nylon belt, specifically designed to be very light-weight, was first issued in 2003 as a replacement for worn leather belts. The belt consists of one firearm <b>holster</b> placed on the hip (either side), one firearm magazine pouch, one ASP (baton) pouch, one OC Spray pouch, one hand cuff pouch and one holder for the portable radio.|$|E
5000|$|Introduction of the HP-35 {{and similar}} {{scientific}} calculators by Texas Instruments soon thereafter signaled {{the demise of}} the slide rule as a status symbol among science and engineering students. Slide rule <b>holsters</b> rapidly gave way to [...] "electronic slide rule" [...] <b>holsters,</b> and colleges began to drop slide-rule classes from their curricula.|$|R
5000|$|Outside the {{waistband}} (OWB) or belt <b>holsters,</b> are {{most commonly used}} by police and military, and by citizens who choose to open carry. Belt <b>holsters</b> can be worn high {{and close to the}} body, slightly behind the hip bone ("4:00 position"), and can be concealed under a long, untucked shirt or jacket.|$|R

25|$|From 1972 to 1981 a {{modified}} M1911A1 called the RIA M15 General Officer's Model was issued to General Officers in the US Army and US Air Force. From 1982 to 1986 the regular M1911A1 was issued. Both {{came with a}} black leather belt, open <b>holster</b> with retaining strap, and a two-pocket magazine pouch. The metal buckle and fittings were similar to the M1916 General Officer's Model except it came in gold metal for the Army and in silver metal for the Air Force. The M15 and M1911A1 were replaced with the M9 pistol in 1986.|$|E
25|$|When Geronimo surrendered, {{he had in}} his {{possession}} a Winchester Model 1876 lever-action rifle with a silver-washed barrel and receiver, bearing Serial Number 109450. It is on display at the United States Military Academy, West Point, New York. Additionally, he had a Colt Single Action Army revolver with a nickel finish and ivory stocks bearing the serial number 89524, and a Sheffield Bowie knife with a dagger type blade and a stag handle made by George Wostenholm in an elaborate silver-studded <b>holster</b> and cartridge belt. The revolver, rig, and knife are on display at the Fort Sill museum.|$|E
25|$|TGSCOM Inc., {{an online}} gun {{wholesaler}} based in Green Bay, Wisconsin, sold Sodini an empty Glock 9 mm magazine and magazine loading apparatus {{used in the}} attack. TGSCOM sold a used handgun to Seung-Hui Cho, who subsequently used it during the 2007 Virginia Tech shootings. TGSCOM also sold an empty magazine and a <b>holster</b> to Stephen Kazmierczak, who shot and killed five people at Northern Illinois University in 2008. TGSCOM closed in 2012, having become the subject of investigations by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Wisconsin Better Business Bureau, and Green Bay police.|$|E
