In this research, a 12. 47 kV real distribution network has been modeled using real time digital simulator, using real data from a power distributor. The study presents four different scenarios of uncoordinated EVs integration for two different charging times (evening and night) and two different charging rates (level I and level II) at different penetration levels ranging from 10 % to 100 %. Voltage unbalance at different locations is determined and transformer overloading is analyzed. The influence of EVs charging on the daily load curve is shown.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer ScienceIntegration of Distributed Generation (DG) {{increases}} the intricacy {{of the distribution}} feeder. Determining the optimal location of DG with minimized complexity is an important task for distribution engineers. The DG integration requires the evaluation of technical aspects that demands a wide network of vulnerability and operational effects. The test network adopted in this network is modeled as a directed graph network that is formed from a power flow method in Backward-Forward-Sweep algorithm. The topological importance of each node is derived from betweenness centrality to represent the weights. A DG unit is used to supply the real and reactive power. An Optimal Performance Index (OPI) is introduced in this work to combine technical and critical indices, namely real and reactive power loss, voltage <b>deviation,</b> <b>voltage</b> and current harmonic distortion, vulnerability and marginal indices for DG penetration with Vulnerability Index (VI) weightage factor. The VI weightage factor {{is to determine the}} degree of criticality of each node when DG is integrated. The OPI evaluation leads to the determination of optimal placement of DG in IEEE 13 radial feeder with constant DG load model. Different case studies have been used that include the OPI evaluation with multiple DG. The results are observed and analyzed to validate the proposed model...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Pathological {{oscillations}} in {{the beta}} frequencies (8 - 30 Hz) {{have been found}} in the local field potentials of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and non-human primate models of PD 1. In particular, these synchronizations appear in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a common target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) for medically intractable PD 2. DBS and dopamine replacement therapy have been shown to reduce these oscillations and ameliorate the motor symptoms of PD. To better understand the origin and mechanisms of these synchronizations, we performed in vitro multielectrode recordings from the rat basal ganglia that support the detection of synchronous activity from numerous neurons. Methods: 300 - 400 μm basal ganglia slices were obtained from Wistar rats (postnatal days 15 - 60) using a vibratome and warmed up to room temperature in a holding chamber. The slices were transferred onto a 3 D multielectrode array (Ayanda Systems) for recording and continuously perfused with carbogenated artificial cerebral spinal fluid at 36 °C. Neural signals were measured and filtered with a 60 channel amplifier (Multichannel Systems GmbH) and visualized in LabView. Action potentials were detected from the extracellular signal using a 5 standard <b>deviation</b> <b>voltage</b> threshold and sorted into different neuronal units using principal component analysis. Further signal analysis was performed in Matlab to analyze the neuronal firing patterns and measure the extent of synchronous firing. Results: Our preliminary results identified three distinct firing patterns in the STN and substantia nigra. Most neurons exhibited regular spike trains (60 %) while others were random (30 %) or bursty (10 %). The addition of dopamine however reduced the percentage of cells with bursty and random firing patterns. Additionally, we found a very low incidence of synchronizations. Taken together, these results form the basis with which to compare firing patterns in an animal model of PD. Conclusions: Multi-electrode array recordings from the basal ganglia can reveal changes in their neurophysiological properties and measure the amount of synchronization between different neurons. We intend to use this technique to investigate pathological firing patterns in the basal ganglia in a rotenone rat model of PD. Using a combination of chemical and electrical stimulation, we will explore contributions from different nuclei of the basal ganglia to the network behavior. This would allow us to build more realistic models of the basal ganglia and lead to better therapies for PD...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. At {{alternating}} current traction substations are used three-winding transformers. This scheme comes to significant costs from power quality disturbances at each supplier. The most significant power quality indices at {{alternating current}} traction substation are voltage <b>deviation,</b> <b>voltage</b> unbalance and harmonic distortion. The {{purpose of this}} article is power quality complex estimation at two traction substations that work on the one district of traction network. Methodology. The measurements were made according to accepted program during 24 hours with 1 sec discretization. A few power quality analyzers PM 175 are used to record data with time synchronization. The scheme of measurements means that devices are connected through current and potential transformers at the each level of voltage. Findings. Voltage level at different substation is various due to power losses in primary network. The voltage in one phase of 1 -st substation is bigger than in other phases. Voltage THD values according to standard requirements are below norm only for primary 154 kV networks. For another traction and regional networks voltage THD values are above norm value. The voltage unbalances in 154 kV networks are below voltage unbalance in 35 kV networks. Besides the voltage unbalance in 154 kV network is below 2 % that complies with the requirements of standard. At the same time we can consider that voltage and current spectrums consist from discrete harmonics with frequencies that multiples of the fundamental frequency. Originality. Voltages at the connection points of traction substations to supply lines are complex stationary random process that determines the voltage mode of the external power supply system of each traction substation. The flows of active and reactive power of the higher harmonics at AC traction substation are directed opposite power of the fundamental harmonic. The power flows on higher harmonics create the disturbing impact on related devices. The total power at AC traction substation consists of 61, 8 % of the active power, 32, 5 % of the reactive power of the 1 st harmonic and 5, 7 % of the distortion power in the quadrature components. Practical value. Analysis of the quadrature components suggests that traditional approaches to reactive power compensation at the fundamental frequency will be sufficiently effective. But the influence of the distortion power on reducing energy losses must be also researched. Besides reactive power compensation should be considered with the issue of reducing the basic power quality indices to standardized values...|$|E
