Aney, Governor of Bihar, wrote about Dr. Sahib: [...] "…Last I met him was when he came to Colombo on a {{deputation}} of the Aligarh University to collect funds for the Medical College. I believe he made handsome collections there and was received very warmly, not just by Mohammedans at Colombo, but by other communities also. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>great</b> <b>respect</b> for his learning and versatility." ...|$|R

2500|$|Bill James {{predicted}} that in 2011 Kalish would bat [...]271, with 20 {{home runs and}} 43 stolen bases. By comparison, James anticipated that Carl Crawford would steal one fewer base. [...] J. P. Ricciardi, {{special assistant to the}} Mets general manager, {{predicted that}} Kalish will be [...] "a star". [...] Peter Gammons said during spring training that comparisons of Kalish and [...] Trot Nixon may underestimate Kalish's potential: [...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>great</b> <b>respect</b> for Trot Nixon, but Ryan Kalish is a totally different athlete. He is a great athlete. I see him being a guy, he doesn’t swing and miss a lot, who's going to hit somewhere between [...]280 and [...]300, hit 25 home runs. [...] He can run. I think he's going to be a really exciting player.|$|E

[...] "He has been took by a very charming and entirely pleasant woman, and {{they are about to}} be married before three months, the one to the other.

5000|$|Alan Levy {{chose to}} become active {{in our country}} during what was for us a very {{sensitive}} and important period -- the time of creating a free, open environment for the media. Because of his human qualities and professional experience, he quickly became recognized as a not inconsiderable figure for whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>great</b> <b>respect.</b> What is more, I regret him leaving us at a point when a number of Czech media outlets are blurring the limits between serious and tabloid journalism.Václav Havel, former President of the Czech Republic ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1939, the {{majority}} of CCF members refused to support Woodsworth's opposition to Canada's entry into World War II. During {{the debate on the}} declaration of war, Mackenzie King said: [...] "There are few men in this Parliament for whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>greater</b> <b>respect</b> than the leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.

A man of that calibre is an ornament to any Parliament." ...|$|R
2500|$|Dana White said in 2008; [...] "Ken Shamrock {{was in a}} {{beef with}} us over his contract. We thought he retired, he was {{claiming}} he didn't and still had one fight. And my attitude was, I'd rather pay Ken Shamrock to not fight. I'd rather pay him to not fight and just say, [...] "stay home, Ken". Ken is way past his prime, {{it gets to the}} point where it's dangerous for that guy to still be fighting." [...] WWE announcer Jim Ross said before Shamrock's scheduled fight with Bobby Lashley in early 2009; [...] "There was a time that I could see the veteran, 45-year-old Shamrock, a former WWE superstar, schooling the MMA rookie Lashley but that ship has long since sailed. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>great</b> <b>respect</b> for Ken but he's outstayed his welcome in the octagon, cage, whatever and needs to teach and coach and stop fighting...Kenny is fighting for one more pay day while Lashley is fighting to help establish what he hopes will be a long term, lucrative, MMA career." ...|$|E
2500|$|The province's sovereigntist {{political}} party, the Parti Québécois (PQ), {{has pushed}} for reforms: at a constitutional conference held in Ottawa in February 1968, delegates from Quebec {{indicated that a}} provincial president might suit the province better than the Queen and a lieutenant governor, but the proposal was not accepted. In an interview in 1971, the then leader of the PQ, René Lévesque, when asked {{if there would be}} any role for the monarchy in an independent Quebec, responded: [...] "Are you joking? Why? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>great</b> <b>respect</b> for the Queen... but what the hell part should monarchy have in Quebec?" [...] University of Toronto professor Richard Toporoski held the theory that a sovereign, not independent, Quebec would still be under the sovereignty of the : [...] "...the real problem of the Quebec bill is not separation from Canada: Quebec has said that it wishes to preserve common elements—Canadian currency (issued officially by whom?—the Queen of Canada), for example, and the possibility of Quebec citizens being Canadian citizens (and who are Canadian citizens?—subjects of the Queen)." ...|$|E
60|$|Benjamin Franklin was a shrewd, excellent, kindly man. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>great</b> <b>respect</b> for him. The {{force of}} genial {{common-sense}} respectability could no further go. George Fox {{was the very}} antipodes of all this, and yet one understands {{how he came to}} move the world of his day, and Franklin did not.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{he is an}} excellent, neighbourly, man. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a <b>great</b> <b>respect</b> for Sir Vavasour. Would you dine with me, Mr Hatton, on Thursday? It {{would give}} me and Lady de Mowbray great pleasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} {{becoming}} in one {{who takes the}} Queen's pay to show a becoming anxiety as to the Queen's aristocracy. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the <b>greatest</b> <b>respect</b> for the Marquis of Kingsbury. Have not you, Mr. Jerningham?" ...|$|R
60|$|Well; so he WAS a snob. But, vulgar as he was, I declare, for my part, that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a <b>greater</b> <b>respect</b> for Mr. Woolsey {{than for}} any single nobleman or gentleman {{mentioned}} in this true history.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are aware," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, [...] "that I am, at your request, about {{to use my}} {{influence}} with the Dey in behalf of certain friends of yours.

6000|$|... "And thy mother, Sigismund; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>great</b> <b>respect</b> {{for that}} noble mother, who, doubtless, is endowed {{with more than}} her sex's {{firmness}} and constancy, since she must have sworn faith and love to thy father, knowing his duties and the hopelessness of their being evaded?

6000|$|... "Hum! This is {{certainly}} very excellent testimony in your favour, young gentleman; and--coming, as it does, from two so respectable and affluent houses as Spriggs, Boggs and Tweed, and Hammer and Hacket--entitled to great credit. A richer and broader bottomed firm than the former, {{is not to}} be found in all his Majesty's colonies; and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>great</b> <b>respect</b> for the latter, though envious people do say that they over-trade a little." ...|$|E

"Oh, Lady Scatcherd! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the <b>{{greatest}}</b> <b>respect</b> for Dr Thorne," [...] said he; [...] "the greatest possible respect; a most skilful practitioner--something brusque certainly, {{and perhaps}} a little obstinate.

But I would rather {{leave it to}} others than myself to {{pronounce}} how far such a temptation is always likely to be resisted, and how far, when repairs are once permitted to be undertaken, a fabric {{is likely to be}} spared from mere interest in its beauty, when its destruction, under the name of restoration, has become permanently remunerative to a large body of workmen.|$|E
60|$|These, Sir, are my {{reasons for}} not {{entertaining}} that high opinion of untried force by which many gentlemen, for whose sentiments in other particulars <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>great</b> <b>respect,</b> seem to be so greatly captivated.

"He is in {{an awkward}} position," [...] Mr. Malet said, [...] "but he has {{reinstated}} himself, several times, when it seemed that everything was lost. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>great</b> <b>respect</b> for his abilities, {{and he is the}} only man who can curb the ambition of Scindia and his ministers. Scindia's entire supremacy would be most unwelcome to us for, indeed, it is only owing to the mutual jealousy of the three great chiefs of the Mahratta nation, that we have gained successes. Were the whole power in one hand, we should certainly lose Surat, and probably Bassein and Salsette, and have to fight hard to hold Bombay.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh dear, no; {{certainly}} not. If {{you want}} to go to town at all, I will take rooms for you. And as for his Royal Highness--! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a <b>great</b> <b>respect</b> for his Royal Highness, but I do not in the least desire to meet him at Dumbello's table." ...|$|R
