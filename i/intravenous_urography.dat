40|$|Renal colic - <b>intravenous</b> {{excretion}} <b>urography</b> versus native {{examination of}} the uropoietic system using a spiral CT scan This thesis presents a comparison of two imaging techniques that are most frequently indicated for diagnosis of renal colic. These are <b>intravenous</b> excretion <b>urography</b> and native {{examination of the}} abdomen and pelvis using a spiral CT scan. By comparing the following aspects, I would like {{to contribute to the}} complete elimination of the indication of <b>intravenous</b> excretion <b>urography</b> and replace it with spiral CT scanning. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate that native examination of the abdomen and pelvis using a spiral CT scan is more beneficial and more suitable both for the diagnosis and for the patient. Within the thesis, I also compare the aspects of radiation burden, time and financial requirements and last but not least the overall burden on the patient {{over the course of the}} examination. The comparison was performed by calculating a typical effective dose in a sample of fifty patients examined by <b>intravenous</b> excretion <b>urography</b> and fifty patients examined by spiral CT scan. The results are shown in graph format. These results did not confirm the hypothesis that the radiation burden is lower in spiral CT scanning. The doses determined in my thesis are up to three times higher in the CT scan. In financial terms, both imaging techniques have been evaluated as almost comparable and the price of the examination should not influence selection of the method. Spiral CT scanning is much more beneficial when comparing the time needed for performance of the two techniques. The results pertaining to the radiation burden for patients during spiral CT scanning suggest how important the radiology assistant?s ability is in influencing the size of the effective dose by the proper selection and inspection of the exposure parameters when selecting the examination protocol. This statement is further strengthened when comparing the results of this work with those of foreign studies, where the radiation burden on patients examined by spiral CT scanning was one to four times lower than my results of effective doses. The effective doses obtained were close to the effective doses determined during <b>intravenous</b> excretion <b>urography.</b> The objective of this Bachelor's thesis is to outline the possibilities for reducing the radiation burden on patients examined by spiral CT scan...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} some {{autonomic}} nervous drugs were observ e d in subcutaneous urographies {{as well as}} the different behavior of Pilocarpine and Mecholyl under conditions of parasympathetic nerve block. Their effects up o n <b>intravenous</b> <b>urographies</b> had been studied, and some interesting facts had been found. However, they might be recognizable merely when the concentration of the contrast medium in the blood was so high. Therefore, it seems to be necessary to perform another experiment under a condition in which it is as low as in clinical cases. For this purpose, subcutaneous urography with 30 ml of diluted aqueous Urografin-solution (12. 5 %) containing hyaluronidase (Sprase 500 units per 120 ml of the solution) was undertaken (Exp. I). Dru g s given intramuscularly with or without intravenous Neophyllin-injection were Atropine, Pilocarpine and Mecholyl. The methods of administration and the doses of those drugs were as same as in the previously reported <b>intravenous</b> <b>urographies.</b> The roentgenograms in each animal were obtained at 15, 3 0 and 60 minutes after the injection of the contrast medium. Immediately after th e final roentgenography, urinary quantity, concentration and excreted amount of contrast medium were measured. On such experimental material s {{as well as the}} changes in the sharpness of urograms in each animal, correlations between two phenomena were speculated mathematically. On the other hand, comparisons of those results between <b>intravenous</b> and subcutaneous <b>urographies</b> were made, because the author had expected that the results in the latter would not necessarily coincide with those in the former. By the way, the effects of Pilocarpine and Mecholyl had been studied with a special interest in Part I, and there were found several differences between them, especially the modes of mechanism in affecting the renal tubules and some other secretory glands. And then, the author had concluded the innervation of cholinergic nerve to the urinary secretion as well as the correlation between the systemic autonomic nervous condition and the renal function. But it seems to be too hypothetical to convince them. Hence, their effects to the tubular excretion and the u rograms were observed under a condition of parasympathetic nerve block ensued from intramuscular administration of Triomin-Finalin which {{was supposed to be the}} most effective blocking agent (Exp. II). The main points of the results are as follows : 1) Subcutaneous pyelograms of diagnostic valu e in rabbits can be obtained by use of parasympathicomimetic drugs, such as Pilocarpine and Mecholyl, under a diuretic condition ensued with Neophyllin. 2) It is su g gested that the effect of Neophyllin to promote the excretion of contrast medium is widely different in accordance with the concentration of the latter in the blood. If the concentration is higher than the value of tubular maximum, remarkable increase in excretion of the contrast medium is ensued; and on the contrary, if it is lower than the value, the excretion does not increase essentially, although the urinary quantities increase to some degree to promote the sharpness of pyelograms in both cases. These phenomena can be explained as a result of th e different percentages of its component filtrated by glomeruli and secreted by tubules. 3) The mode of correlation between grades of sharpness of pyelograms and the conditions of excretion of the contrast medium in subcutaneous urographies is somewhat different from that in <b>intravenous</b> <b>urographies,</b> especially in both Neophyllin-groups; namely in Neophyllingroups, i. e., Neophyllin-. Atropine+ Neophyllin-, Pilocarpine+ Neophyllin- and Mecholy 1 + Neophyllin-groups, a positive correlation is recognized between the concentration of excreted contrast medium and the sharpness, and negative one between the urinary quantity and the sharpness. Those are the same relations as in Non-Neophyllin-groups in <b>intravenous</b> <b>urographies.</b> This fact can be explained reasonably from the difference of Neophyllin-effect upon the excretion of the contrast medium in both methods of excretory urographies. 4) It is shown experimentally that the urinary tracts can be cont rasted easily or hardly among various animals and that excretory urography in rabbit is probably one of the most difficult cases. The m ost probable causes for this fact are found in the different states of diuresis and ureteropelvic peristalses. 5) It is con firmed strictly that the grades of sharpness of the pyelograms in excretory urographies are dependent upon the concentration of excreted contrast medium and upon the degree of partial stasis of urine in the renal pelvis. 6) Under the condition of parasympathetic n erve block, Mecholyl can show the same effect upon the tubular secretion as well as the salivary secretion as strong as in the case without nerve block; however, Pilocarpine is quite ineffective upon those secretions. Hence, it is obviously reasonable to conclude that Pilocarpine prod u ces the effects affecting the cholinergic nerve and that, on the contrary, Mecholyl does directly afftecting the cells of secretory glands. 7) It is proved that the changes of the renal function caused by Mecholyl reflect essentially the sensitivity of the secretory cells of renal tubules to the choline-like substances. From the conception, it seems to be possibly true that the diseased kidney of uroli thiasis is in a state of persistent parasympathicotonia. 8) As mentioned above, the effect of Mecholyl does not show the tonus of autonomic nerves itself. Therefore, the value of the Mecholyl-Test is questionable when the result of the test is determined merely by the changes of the blood-pressure. Especially, such conceptions as Type-S=Sympathicotonia and Type-P=Parasympathicotonia should be strictly criticized...|$|R

The next paragraph deals with the issue of urolithiasis, classification of urinary stones and factors contributing to formation of urolithiasis. Undoubtedly, {{one of the most important}} passages in the theoretical part of the thesis is a detailed description of individual imaging methods used in urology. Every medical examination includes procedure, preparation of a patient, indication, contraindication, benefits and drawbacks typical for implementation of imaging methods. The last part of the theoretical section covers a comparison of particular medical srceenings according to the negative radiation effects on the patient and according to the financial point of view. The second part of the thesis focuses on hypothesis and description of the research methodology. The aim of the thesis is seen in a comparison as well as in a research of frequency of individual imaging methods used in renal illnesses causing renal colic. The research was focused on this aim and all useful data in connection with description of methodology were applied. Another goal of the research was verification of hypothesis which is based on the belief that methods without using contrastive substances are more frequently applied. Methodology used in the bachelor thesis describes collecting of data, processing and comparison of patients´ files who underwent treatment of renal colic in the urology ward in the hospital in Havlíčkův Brod. The research was mainly oriented on imaging methods using contrasting substances as well as non-contrasting methods. Amongst these imaging screenings belong ultrasonography, plain radiograph of kidneys, <b>intravenous</b> excretory <b>urography,</b> computed tomography with low-dose technique and CT with application of contrastive substance. The data was collected from the hospital information system service known as NIS in Havlíčkův Brod. The first data collection method was aimed at group of patients with renal colic diagnosis who have experienced radiodiagnostic examination methods in the hostital in Havlíčkův Brod in 2012. The group consisted of one hundred patients. In the first place, frequency of occurrence of urolithiasis and its frequency of particular examination of both sexes was examined. It was followed by the research of the frequency imaging methods for the entire year 2012. The final research was focused on the number of condactive examinations using contrastive substance. In the end, it was compared to the number of realized screenings without contrasing substance. The second data collection included the number of conducted screenings in last fifteen years. Out of this data frequency of examinations in the years 1999 and 2013 were compared and represented.
