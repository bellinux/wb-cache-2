50|$|The {{early history}} of the {{settlement}} is obscure, in spite of an <b>exploratory</b> <b>survey</b> carried out, with permission of the Turkish authorities, by the British Institute at Ankara (BIAA) in 1974-76. It seems that Oinoanda became a colony of Termessos about 200-190 BC and was also called Termessos Minor (or Termessos i pros Oinoanda). Oenoanda was the most southerly of the Kibyran Tetrapoleis in the Hellenistic Period, which was dissolved by L. Licinius Murena in 84 BCE, whereupon Oenoanda {{became part of the}} koinon of Lycia, as its inscriptions abundantly demonstrate.|$|E

Pioneer herself and her survey launches completed inshore hydrography of the project area on 28 May 1959, after which Pioneer conducted offshore hydrography controlled by LORAC and LORAN, beginning with an <b>exploratory</b> <b>survey</b> of the entire project area, followed by surveys for the location and routes of submarine cables.

50|$|Like {{all other}} languages, Chikuhane {{has its own}} {{linguistic}} and philosophical intricacies evident in the different verbal arts the speakers produce. In an <b>exploratory</b> <b>survey</b> Ndana (1999) has demonstrated that Chikuhane has a corpus of oral literature which he feels deserves preservation in order to safe-guard the verbal artistry it contains. Such verbal compositions include and not limited to fables, poetry, songs, and witticisms. There is, however, a great decline in the knowledge of both the arts and culture among young people. This is probably attributed to urban life, where young Subiyas {{are influenced by the}} external cultures and exposed to various forms of art that do not originate from Subiyas.|$|E

5000|$|Another folktale or legend {{surrounding}} the town suggests that Pinabacdao's name {{was derived from}} miscommunication. These was the time when according to the folktale {{during the early years}} of settlement, officers from the Samar provincial government (probably on a mapping, census or <b>exploratory</b> <b>survey)</b> passed along the newly organized town and saw a man tied on a pole, standing on an ant colony. The Spanish officers asked one of the townsmen as to what is the name of the place. The townsman, not understanding the question in Spanish and thinking that the officer was pertaining to the tied man standing on ant colony immediately replied in Waray-waray dialect - [...] "Pinabakdaw" [...] or simply [...] "asked to stand". This story was believed to be the reason why the bureaucrats recorded the name of the town as Pinabacdao.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{historical}} records {{shows that the}} name has been variously spelled by the Spanish chroniclers. Conquistador Miguel de Loarca, in his extreme <b>exploratory</b> <b>survey</b> trip of the archipelago, first mentioned and spelled it [...] "Beslin" [...] in his historical accounts “Relacion de los Yslas Filipinas” in 1582, {{as well as in}} the Confirmaciones de Encomienda (1616-1700) which Bislig was under the encomienda of Alferez Juan delas Marianas in 1619. In the “Historia general de los religiosos descalzos del orden de San Agustin” of Fray Andres de San Nicolas in 1664 spelled it [...] "Bislin" [...] and also in the “Historia general... del Orden de San Agustin” of Fray Luis de Jesus in 1681. A Franciscan writer, Fray Juan de San Francisco de San Antonio spelled it [...] "Baslig" [...] in his “Cronicas” in 1738. Other Spanish chroniclers spelled it [...] "Bislic" [...] and [...] "Bisliq".|$|E
5000|$|At its inception, the SSM was {{the first}} and only American cantorial school and sought to educate cantors to serve all American Jewish communities. While the school's founders, {{including}} the influential members of The Society for the Advancement of Jewish Liturgical Music, articulated their desire to create a cantorial school for all of American Jewry, particular attention was given to serving the Reform Movement's specific needs since the SSM's inception. HUC Dean Franzlblau conducted an <b>exploratory</b> <b>survey</b> of North American Reform congregations to gauge their [...] "receptivity to cantor-educators in 1948." [...] The results of the study revealed that congregations would be most receptive to hiring well-trained cantors who were prepared to take on significant education roles in synagogues. The school's earliest curriculum responded to this need, training what were called [...] "cantor-educators," [...] or cantors with additional training in education. Cantorial certification was awarded after three years of study. The SSM has since undergone a significant evolution, first offering a bachelor's degree in four years, beginning in the fall of 1953), and ultimately conferring a Master of Sacred Music over the course of five years and culminating with investiture as cantor.|$|E

50|$|In 1880, {{convinced}} of its possibilities, August Anderssen and Francis Herron made an <b>exploratory</b> <b>survey</b> {{of the lower}} Herbert Region before heading off to Cardwell to approach the Land Agent to stake a selection. A small land rush ensued, marking {{the beginning of an}} area noted for its small farm settlement, distinct from large plantations. Anderssen purchased 360 acres (portion 228) and a year later purchased the adjoining block (portion 270), but later that year sold part of it to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company (CSR). The company proceeded to build a wharf there to service their Victoria Plantation nearby. At this stage sugar would be loaded at the Halifax wharf, which was an important terminus for Herbert River traffic, and then taken downstream by boat to the deepwater Port of Dungeness {{at the mouth of the}} Herbert River. At around the same time that the Anderssen family moved down to their property, so too did nine other families. They occupied an area of approximately 2,200 acres comprising ten selections, which became known as Black's Township. In 1881 Copnell built the first hotel on Anderssen's Riverview estate. It was established on an area of Anderssen's estate which would later become the present Halifax and was quickly joined by a store built by Eugene Regazzoli who purchased a portion of Anderssen's land. This store serviced the fledgling community.|$|E
5000|$|In 1922, young Prabodh {{reached the}} first {{milestone}} of his career, when he accompanied Sylvain Lévi and Madame Lévi to Nepal. His painstaking work in exploring original manuscripts and the Tibetan and Chinese manuscripts of old Sanskrit texts which {{were lost in}} their originals but preserved in their translations at the Royal Durbar Library of Nepal resulted in his invaluable findings {{in the domain of}} Indological research. Among his findings the palm leaf manuscripts of Kaula-Jnana- Nirnaya and Sammoho Tantra need special mention as they throw light on mysticism, influence of Sakti-ism on later Buddhism and emergence of new religious creeds.In 1922, Prabodh reached another milestone when he was awarded Rashbehari Ghosh Travelling Fellowship for one year. He travelled to Indo-China, Cambodia, Cochin-China and Japan. He got the opportunity to work with Sylvain Lévi, Louis Finot, the founder of Ecole de Pali in Phnom Penh, George Groslier who established a renowned museum in Phnom Penh, National Museum of Cambodia, Henry Marshal, the head of Ecole Francaise d' extreme orient in Hanoi and Henri Permentier exponent of Khmer art and culture. Prabodh Chandra was enriched with their <b>exploratory</b> <b>survey</b> of the archaeological remains of Angkor Vat.

40|$|The {{need for}} farmer participation, {{considering}} {{the complexity and}} diversity of bean production systems in Uganda, is highlighted. Through on-farm experimentation, technologies can be evaluated under farmers` environmental and managerial conditions. Farmer participation in bean research in {{the country has been}} mainly in the form of <b>exploratory</b> <b>surveys</b> (identification of production constraints and possible solutions, bean/banana intercropping, bean storage practices and constraints) and on-farm experimentation (var., NP fertilization, yield, maize/climbing bean intercropping, and disease and beanfly control). The implications for on-farm research regarding <b>exploratory</b> <b>surveys</b> and farmer participation in Uganda, based on the experience of the National Bean Program, are discussed. The role of extension agents in on-farm research is analyzed, emphasizing the importance of the researcher-extension agent-farmer linkage. Due to the complementarity of on-station and on-farm research, these activities should not be planned separately. It is suggested that much of the descriptive and diagnostic work involved in on-farm research be noncommodity- specific; by coordinating survey work at a the national level, each program would avoid having to collect the same information. The background, objectives, and resources of the National Bean Program are also indicated. (CIAT...|$|R
