40|$|Background The World Health Organization’s Global Code on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel urges Member States {{to observe}} <b>fair</b> <b>recruitment</b> {{practices}} and ensure {{equality of treatment}} of migrant and domestically-trained health personnel. However, international medical graduates (IMGs) have experienced difficulties in accessing postgraduate training and in progressing their careers in several destination countries. Ireland is highly dependent on IMGs, but also employs non-European Union (EU) doctors who qualified as doctors in Ireland. However, little is known regarding the career progression of these doctors. In this context, the present study assesses the determinants of career progression of non-EU doctors with particular focus on whether barriers to progression exist for those graduating outside Ireland {{compared to those who}} have graduated within. Methods The study utilises quantitative data from an online survey of non-EU doctors registered with the Medical Council of Ireland undertaken as part of the Doctor Migration Project (2011 – 2013). Non-EU doctors registered with the Medical Council of Ireland were asked to complete an online survey about their recruitment, training and career experiences in Ireland. Analysis was conducted on the responses of 231 non-EU hospital doctors whose first post in Ireland was not permanent. Career progression was analysed by means of binary logistic regression analysis. Results While some of the IMGs had succeeded in accessing specialist training, many experienced slow or stagnant career progression when compared with Irish-trained non-EU doctors. Key predictors of career progression for non-EU doctors working in Ireland showed that doctors who qualified outside of Ireland were less likely than Irish-trained non-EU doctors to experience career progression. Length of stay as a qualified doctor in Ireland was strongly associated with career progression. Those working in anaesthesia {{were significantly more likely to}} experience career progression than those in other specialities. Conclusions The present study highlights differences in terms of achieving career progression and training for Irish-trained non-EU doctors, compared to those trained elsewhere. However, the findings herein warrant further attention from a workforce planning and policy development perspective regarding Ireland’s obligations under the Global Code of hiring, promoting and remunerating migrant health personnel on the basis of equality of treatment with the domestically-trained health workforce...|$|E
40|$|International {{migration}} of workers is growing. The global economic slowdown {{of the late}} 2000 s and the early 2010 s put a brake on employment opportunities in many countries across the world, and the crisis is not fully behind us. Nonetheless, the number of labor migrants is still increasing, and this publication shows that 2015 {{may well be a}} peak year for labor migration from Asian countries, both within the region and toward OECD countries outside of Asia. Neither political shifts nor persistent low oil prices have yet put a dent in the legal movement of Asian workers to employment in other countries. These large-scale flows are nothing new, yet policies are in flux, both for the management of labor migration and for the protection of migrant workers. Asian countries are making constant adjustments to their policies to better match the flows of migrant workers to the needs of their countries, to protect migrant workers, and to strengthen compliance mechanisms. There is increasing attention to migrant workers in multilateral frameworks. Two of the UN Sustainable Development Goals targets relate directly to the need to lower costs borne by migrant workers, especially those who leave their families to support them by working temporarily abroad. There has been a growing focus on <b>fair</b> <b>recruitment</b> practices—those which do not charge fees and related costs to migrants and allow them to keep a greater share of their earnings. Another important issue in protecting workers is to ensure that they are not exploited at the workplace, and this extends equally to those who are undocumented. The publication provides evidence on the extent of irregular migration in Asia. Reducing irregular migration requires a comprehensive approach, and cannot be limited to immigration enforcement measures only. The need to improve labor protections for all workers can be matched with mechanisms to ensure that legal matching between workers and employers can occur without exorbitant costs, and that appropriate channels are in place for orderly and safe migration. One of the most vulnerable groups of labor migrants are women working in domestic work and home-based care work, particularly since their work is often not recognized as real work with economic value, and as they work in isolation in the household of employers. The chapter in this year’s publication highlights the importance of gender responsiveness in managing labor migration and in developing policies to protect all migrant workers. Since 2011, the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have organized an annual Roundtable on Labor Migration in Asia. Since 2013, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has also participated, and the three organizations have put together an annual report on the themes of the roundtable. The February 2016 event, held in Tokyo, focused on Safeguarding Labor Migrants from Home to Workplace. The question of how best to ensure that migrants are not subject to harm as they move abroad to work is one on which governments in Asia are working, on behalf of their own citizens and those who have come as migrants. This publication is intended to help make a contribution to the work of policy planners, experts, and practitioners in the region...|$|E

40|$|The {{revealing}} {{detail of}} a bipartisan Senate report suggests the government will eventually have to abandon its opposition to Pacific Islanders picking Australian fruit writes Peter Mares AT THE Pacific Islands Forum in Fiji this week, Prime Minister John Howard has once again rejected proposals for Australia to open up its horticultural labour market to Pacific Island workers (even though New Zealand is moving cautiously down this road). The prime minister can back up his position {{by pointing out that}} a six-month long Senate inquiry did not support calls for a pilot scheme to test the feasibility of a Pacific seasonal labour program. But it would be a pity if the committee’s stance was taken as evidence that proposals for a seasonal labour scheme lack merit. The senators themselves describe their decision not to make a formal recommendation as “unusual” and the substance of their final report suggests that Pacific Islanders may indeed be harvesting Australian fruit in the not too distant future. After visiting key horticultural regions around the country, the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee assessed farmers’ complaints of worker shortages to be exaggerated. Its report, Perspectives on the Future of the Harvest Labour Force, says that the supply of harvest labour - while “sometimes precarious” - is “currently sufficient” {{to meet the needs of}} industry. But that “is the position now” (my emphasis). Liberal, Labor and Democrat Senators agree that “prudence requires the government to make contingency plans for introducing contract harvest labour as early as five years hence. ” The senators note the “heavy investment and greatly expanded areas under cultivation” in horticulture and lambast “the unaccountable failure of agribusinesses to factor labour supply into investment decisions. ” Horticulture is already heavily reliant on foreign workers in the form of “backpackers” (young travellers for selected countries who qualify for Working Holiday Maker visas). The report warns that this fickle labour supply could be “interrupted by shock waves from a major terrorist attack or the onset of a global pandemic. ” It notes complaints that footloose backpackers do not make ideal harvest workers (they are liable to knock off and head for the coast if the weather gets too hot) and that “the inefficiencies of their workforce participation result in additional costs to growers. ” The committee also concludes that backpackers distort wage levels: “As their purpose in travelling is essentially recreational rather than related to livelihood, backpackers accept low pay as normal. ” As a result of this and other factors, the committee regards “harvest labour as being, in general, too poorly paid,” making it unlikely that there will be an influx of new workers to the industry. In short, the Senate report predicts that the “current local labour supply is unlikely to increase, and will probably decline” and says that the “prospects for some mobility of harvest labour from Pacific states may become more likely in future. ” The committee believes that “in the near future an Australian government may need to put aside purely domestic considerations” in order to address harvest labour shortages, and it urges the government “to have some work done” to develop the detail of practical policy options: “Governments should not be caught by sudden events and developments which would result in hasty ad hoc arrangements, the result of having to make policy on the run. ” Tasmanian Liberal Senator Guy Barnett goes further. In supplementary comments he calls for action beyond the “wait and see” approach of his colleagues, proposing “a targeted and tightly controlled pilot scheme to meet a demonstrated labour force need in a certain area over a given period. ” The other members of the committee indicate that they would have liked to join Senator Barnett in advancing more adventurous policy recommendations but were constrained from doing so by party political considerations. With industrial relations building up as a key issue for the next federal election, the Senators said it was “difficult [...] . to disregard the influences which affect them as party members at this moment in the electoral cycle. ” They add that any “exploration of policy which includes [...] . a proposal for admitting foreign workers is likely to be vulnerable to populist sentiment at this time. ” This is a remarkably candid but ultimately depressing admission of timidity, given that we are still a year or more out from a federal election with a third of the parliamentary term still to run. It raises the question: at what point in the electoral cycle would senators feel able to canvas controversial policy recommendations? By contrast, the committee was surprisingly blunt in its comments on Australia’s recent experience with temporary labour migration for skilled workers on 457 visas. In what amounts to a rebuke of the government and the immigration department, the committee (chaired by Liberal Senator Judith Troeth) refers in a number of places to problems associated with the 457 visa. The report notes “increasing evidence of unscrupulous exploitation of 457 visas by some labour contract firms and their business clients. ” In abattoirs, for example, “ad hoc arrangements” and “unregulated” living and working conditions can “result in the exploitation of workers” with “little or no social benefit flowing from such arrangements. ” The inference is clear: until problems with the operation and supervision of 457 visas are addressed, temporary labour schemes for unskilled workers like fruit pickers are unlikely to gain political support. The committee’s unequivocal conclusion is that the “answer lies in regulation” and the “much more stringent supervision of contractors and employers. ” This is a welcome finding and it underlines the need for detailed preparatory work to be done before a full-scale Pacific seasonal labour scheme could become operational. The committee notes that there are numerous practical issues to be addressed (such as how to house Pacific seasonal workers, how to split the travel and administrative costs between employers and employees, and how to ensure <b>fair</b> <b>recruitment</b> practices in source countries). As I’ve found in my own research into the operation of Canada’s seasonal agricultural workers program, the devil with such scheme lies in the detail. If a scheme for Pacific Islanders to work in Australian horticulture is to be successful then it will need to be “conducted with high levels of formality and regulation,” as the committee argues, and be seen “not simply as a labour supply measure benefiting the Australian economy, but as a regulated instrument of Pacific region policy. ” • Peter Mares made a submission to the Senate inquiry in his capacity as leader of the senior ARC-funded project Pacific Labour and Australian Horticulture at the Institute for Social Research at Swinburne University of Technology.

40|$|Every year many {{students}} are graduating from their university and {{are faced with the}} difficulty of acquiring an employment, especially large difficulty in Sweden as the unemployment rate is large amongst young adults. The companies are also facing a challenge, of how to receive the best applicants to their job openings, to ensure they will stay competitive as companies. The authors are examining how the students will acquire employment by investigating what demands companies have on applicants and employees at their companies, and what demands the students in Umeå believe the companies have. It is also examined how the companies are marketing themselves to future employees and students and how these marketing efforts are perceived by the students. The theories of interest to examine the research questions mentioned concern employer branding, marketing tools and planned behaviour. This thesis is using a mixed method approach. In the qualitative part of the thesis the authors used semi-structured interviews that were conducted with companies within the business sector in the municipality of Umeå. A survey {{in the form of a}} self-completion questionnaire was used in the quantitative part to measure the perception of Umeå University’s business program students. The result showed that the companies valued experience within their field and personality traits highest. The students had a good understanding of what demands the companies had on their employees and felt that they could fulfil most demands, however having experience within the field the company operates within was most difficult. Most companies used marketing tools such as attending <b>recruitment</b> <b>fairs,</b> holding lectures or engaging in student run organisations. The students did like these techniques the best, i. e. marketing through the university and through <b>recruitment</b> <b>fairs,</b> however, did not appreciate marketing through advertisement. The students value the opportunity to talk to current staff at a company and therefore like <b>recruitment</b> <b>fairs</b> and activities that are organized by the university. The main recommendation is that the students should get more work experience and the companies need to make it easier for the students to achieve this, hence, it will enable the students to fulfil more criterions companies have on their employees...|$|R

Recent meetings, such as the World Health Assembly of 2004 [1] and the High-Level Forum on the Millennium Development Goals in December 2004, {{as well as a number}} of publications have highlighted the severe shortage of health personnel in poorer parts of the world and the rise in demand for health workers in rich countries. The 2005 World Health Assembly, being held this month, is expected to discuss how to limit the adverse effects of the migration and to promote <b>fairer</b> <b>recruitment</b> tactics by developed countries as a follow-up to a resolution passed in 2004. There is now considerable interest in measuring and managing the migratory flow of health workers; in seeking reparations, payments or remittances; and in training “substitute health workers”—groups who have taken on jobs, functions, and roles that are normally the tasks of internationally recognized professionals such as doctors, nurses, and pharmacists [2]. Indeed, words such as “slavery ” and “human rights ” underlie the debate’s emotional underpinnings (such words have appeared, for example, in listserv discussions about health worker migration). Though some migration occurs between rich countries (and also between poor countries), most of the migration of health professionals is occurring from countries with The Perspectives section is for experts to discuss the clinical practice or public health implications of a published article that is freely available online. physician densities of about 17 per 100, 000 population to countries with densities of 300 per 100, 000 population (see p. 16 of [3]).
