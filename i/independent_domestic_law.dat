5000|$|Treaties are {{considered}} the supreme law of many countries. In those countries, treaty provisions fully override conflicting <b>domestic</b> <b>law</b> provisions. For example, many EU countries could not enforce their group relief schemes under the EU directives. In some countries, treaties {{are considered}} of equal weight to <b>domestic</b> <b>law.</b> [...] In those countries, a conflict between <b>domestic</b> <b>law</b> and the treaty must be resolved under the dispute resolution mechanisms of either <b>domestic</b> <b>law</b> or the treaty.|$|R

The ‘conflict of laws’ governs which <b>domestic</b> <b>law</b> applies under the principles of private international law. This refers to a situation where the application of respective <b>domestic</b> <b>laws</b> in a commercial dispute can produce very different outcomes.|$|R

40|$|Tax Treaties and <b>Domestic</b> <b>Law</b> {{provides}} an in-depth {{analysis of the}} relationship between tax treaties and <b>domestic</b> <b>law.</b> It begins from an analysis of the topic from a constitutional and an international point of view, with a particular emphasis on the provisions laid down by Articles 26 and 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Special reports focus on tax treaty issues. In this context, specific problems raised by tax treaties are considered, such as treaty overrides and anti-abuse measures. The interaction between treaty provisions and <b>domestic</b> <b>law</b> is taken into consideration. Individual country surveys show how the issues raised by the relationships between tax treaties and <b>domestic</b> <b>law</b> are resolved by tax administrations and courts in selected European and non-European countries. A specific chapter is devoted to an analysis of how the relationships between tax treaties and <b>domestic</b> <b>law</b> can be improved in the fields of treaty override, treaty residence and anti-abuse measures...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: As we know {{issues related}} to and due to the {{destruction}} of the environment have caused a lot of limitations for the life of human beings, and these problems have been noticed as having global dimensions by researchers from different fields such as international law and even international organizations including the United Nations. On the one hand, the growth of international law in this realm without considering it in the domain of the <b>domestic</b> <b>law</b> of countries is impossible, {{and on the other hand}} as countries notice these issues in their <b>domestic</b> <b>laws,</b> they should also pay attention to such problems in regional agreements and international treaties-based on their <b>domestic</b> <b>laws.</b> So while these problems threaten the earth and the global society and the need for global endeavors to face them is necessary, the underlying requirement of this issue is the attention of <b>domestic</b> <b>laws</b> of countries to these problems. Regarding this the practices of the <b>domestic</b> <b>laws</b> of our country concerning these issues have been noticed to see whether we can reach any unified strategy to face them? For close observation of the problem, attention to constitution, other <b>domestic</b> <b>laws</b> and especially particular laws approved in this regard is necessary. On the other hand, studying the participation of our country in international treaties related to this issue seems necessary since after which strategies in order to develop the attention to these problems and even making them performable will be proposed...|$|R
