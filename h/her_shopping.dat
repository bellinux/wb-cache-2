5|$|Nikki, meanwhile, is {{determined}} to catch the actual thieves and bring forth the truth. After meeting Loudon, Nikki cons him into taking <b>her</b> <b>shopping.</b> After taking a Rolls Royce into Harlem to buy a gun– and nearly being arrested during a police raid– she explains her story to Loudon who believes that she is innocent, and decides to help her. She's also {{on the run from}} a pimp named Raoul (Coati Mundi) and his lackey Benny (Dennis Burkley), the people who killed Johnny. Only after dangling off a car smashed through the top floor of a parking garage, does he tell her the bank and the box number of Nikki's slain boyfriend.|$|E
25|$|Since police detectives {{initially}} {{seemed to}} be unhelpful to Lieberman and assumed that Philip had died with the other victims, he hired Gallant, who found two pieces of evidence suggesting {{that she may have}} returned to the apartment building early on the morning of September 11. The first was the call from the home phone to Lieberman's cell; the second was some videotape from the security cameras in the lobby. Timestamped at 8:43a.m., just 3 minutes before American Airlines Flight 11 was crashed into the North Tower, and within the 7-9 a.m. timeframe during which, Lieberman later testified, Philip always returned after her nights out, it shows a woman entering the building, waiting near the elevator and leaving after a few minutes. Due to the poor contrast from the sunlight in the lobby, she was visible only in silhouette, but her hair and dress are consistent with Philip as seen in the Century 21 tape from the previous evening. Her family also says the woman exhibits similar mannerisms. She is, however, not carrying any of the bags that she would have had from <b>her</b> <b>shopping</b> trip, and again she is apparently unaccompanied. Lieberman could not positively identify her as his wife, but a city police investigator believes it was her.|$|E
500|$|After her {{stint at}} The Sunday Times, she {{embarked}} upon a freelance writing career, realising that [...] "I {{was on the}} wrong ladder.

In the United Kingdom, she wrote for The Daily Telegraph, the Evening Standard, The Observer and The Times Literary Supplement, and penned a food column for Vogue and a makeup column for The Times Magazine, as well as working with Gourmet and Bon Appétit in the United States. After two weeks working on Talk Radio in 1995, Lawson was sacked after she had stated <b>her</b> <b>shopping</b> was done for her, which was deemed incompatible with the radio station's desired [...] "common touch".|$|E

500|$|On February 28, 2007, Moqadem was {{expected}} to return {{from a trip to}} Morocco to visit his family. Lhermitte took her eldest daughter Yasmin to a dermatology appointment. After picking up the rest of her children from school and preparing lunch for them, Lhermitte heard a voice tell her, [...] "the machine is running." [...] Lhermitte mailed two letters: a letter with jewelry for her sisters, and the other letter to her friend Valerie. In the letter to Valerie, she called Dr. Michel Schaar [...] "a rotten bastard" [...] who [...] "stole" [...] the intimacy between herself, her husband, and her children. She also accused her husband of being [...] "deaf" [...] and [...] "blind" [...] to her concerns regarding Dr. Schaar. After mailing the letters, she went to a grocery store and slipped two knives into <b>her</b> <b>shopping</b> bag.|$|E
500|$|Vala started {{wearing the}} normal SG team uniform in [...] "Origin", the third episode of season 9. Claudia Black was later {{included}} in the design process and was given full control over her wardrobe for scenes that required civilian clothes. As such, Black chose Vala's underwear for the seduction scene in [...] "The Ties That Bind" [...] and <b>her</b> <b>shopping</b> tour outfit in [...] "Family Ties". The latter episode also showed Vala with seven distinctly different hairstyles and outfits in total. Fearing the lack of seriousness, the producers opposed the make-up department's decision of having Vala wear curlers, but the scene could not be reshot. Similarly, a scene showing Vala unpacking her hair dryer and curling iron during an offworld mission in [...] "The Quest" [...] was deemed too silly and was trimmed to the basics; {{it would have been}} cut if the footage had allowed it. Due to Black's pregnancy during the filming of the films, the costume department needed to hide Black's bump with appropriate dressing.|$|E
