5|$|Allosteric {{sites are}} pockets on the enzyme, {{distinct}} from the active site, that bind to molecules in the cellular environment. These molecules then cause {{a change in the}} conformation or <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enzyme that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme. In this way, allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes. Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme's metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation, altering the activity of the enzyme according to the flux {{through the rest of the}} pathway.|$|E

5|$|Climate models use {{quantitative}} methods {{to simulate the}} interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface and ice. They are used {{for a variety of}} purposes; from the study of the <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weather and climate system, to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{are usually}} {{much larger than}} their substrates. Sizes range from just 62 amino acid {{residues}}, for the monomer of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, to over 2,500 residues in the animal fatty acid synthase. Only {{a small portion of}} their structure (around 2–4 amino acids) is directly involved in catalysis: the catalytic site. This catalytic site is located next to one or more binding sites where residues orient the substrates. The catalytic site and binding site together comprise the enzyme's active site. The remaining majority of the enzyme structure serves to maintain the precise orientation and <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> active site.|$|E
5|$|Experimentation {{with real}} bikes {{has so far}} {{confirmed}} the weave mode predicted by the eigenvalues. It was found that tire slip and frame flex are not important for the lateral <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bicycle in the speed range up to 6 m/s. The idealized bike model {{used to calculate the}} eigenvalues shown here does not incorporate any of the torques that real tires can generate, and so tire interaction with the pavement cannot prevent the capsize mode from becoming unstable at high speeds, as Wilson and Cossalter suggest happens in the real world.|$|E

5|$|In England, {{prior to}} the nineteenth century, common law {{considered}} children to be the property of their father. However, {{the economic and social}} changes that occurred during the nineteenth century lead to a shift in ideas about the <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family. Industrialization separated the home and the workplace, keeping fathers away from their children in order to earn wages and provide for their family. Conversely, mothers were expected to stay in the home and care for the household and the children. Important social changes such as women's suffrage and child development theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance of maternal care.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} {{of the history of the}} Moberly-Jourdain {{adventure}} and the extensive public reaction to it, Terry Castle noted with skepticism the claim that a shared delusion may have arisen out of a lesbian folie à deux between the two women. Castle concludes that, when all proposed explanations have been considered, a core of mystery remains as much in relation to the psychological <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pair as to any aspects of the paranormal associated with their story.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the Portuguese {{presence}} on the Angolan coast remained limited {{for much of the}} colonial period.

There was no real delimitation of territory; Angola, to all intents and purposes, did not yet exist.|$|E

5|$|The James Bond {{character}} and related media have triggered {{a number of}} criticisms and reactions across the political spectrum, and are still highly debated in popular culture studies. Some observers accuse Bond novels and films of misogyny and sexism. Geographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in the <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War, with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas. Other critics claim that 21st century Bond movies reflect imperial nostalgia. American conservative critics, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s, saw Bond as a nihilistic, hedonistic, and amoral character that challenged family values.|$|E

5|$|The <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air war {{changed in}} June 1941. The German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, opened up the Eastern Front. The German bomber force was heavily committed to the theatre. The escalation of the fighting in the Mediterranean and North African theatres also diverted German air strength. The operations of the Luftwaffe over Britain changed dramatically. Small numbers of bombers would make hit-and-run attacks on selected targets near the coast {{for the remainder of}} 1941, replacing the mass raids of the preceding autumn and winter. Cunningham used the decline in the pace of operations to train new crews.|$|E
5|$|The time-reversed <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{automaton}} can {{be described}} by another cellular automaton. Clearly, {{for this to be}} possible, the update rule must be bijective. In the other direction, if the update rule is bijective, then it has an inverse function that is also bijective. This inverse function must be a cellular automaton rule. The proof of this fact uses the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, a topological characterization of cellular automata rules as the translation-invariant functions that are continuous with respect to the Cantor topology on the space of configurations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} modular dynamics for dual-arms, {{expressed in}} terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kinematics and <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stand-alone manipulators. The two arms are controlled as a single manipulator in the task space that is relative to <b>the</b> two end-effectors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dual-arm robot. A modular relative Jacobian, derived from a previous work, is used which is {{expressed in terms}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stand-alone manipulator Jacobians. The task space inertia is expressed in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jacobians and <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stand-alone manipulators. When manipulators are combined and controlled as a single manipulator, as in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> dual-arms, our proposed approach will not require an entirely new dynamics model for the resulting combined manipulator. But one will use the existing Jacobians and dynamics model for each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stand-alone manipulators {{to come up with}} <b>the</b> <b>dynamics</b> model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> combined manipulator. A dual-arm KUKA is used in the experimental implementation...|$|R
