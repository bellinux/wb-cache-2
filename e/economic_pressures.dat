5|$|Marriage was {{considered}} the normal state for all adult residents of the colony. Most men first married in their mid-twenties and women around age 20. Second marriages were not uncommon, and widows and widowers faced social and <b>economic</b> <b>pressures</b> to remarry. On average, most widows and widowers remarried within {{six months to a}} year. Most adults who reached marriageable age lived into their sixties, so effectively two-thirds of a person's life was spent married.|$|E
5|$|Partly in {{response}} to <b>economic</b> <b>pressures</b> {{and in order to}} protect the vital functions of the state, Diocletian restricted social and professional mobility. Peasants became tied to the land in a way that presaged later systems of land tenure and workers such as bakers, armourers, public entertainers and workers in the mint had their occupations made hereditary. Soldiers' children were also forcibly enrolled, something that followed spontaneous tendencies among the rank-and-file, but also expressed increasing difficulties in recruitment.|$|E
5|$|This period saw a {{political}} alignment with the Eastern Bloc countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with <b>economic</b> <b>pressures</b> {{stemming from the}} 1973 oil crisis, resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and {{a sharp decline in}} living standards, and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and various bilateral donors in exchange for their bailout of the nation's broken economy.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to identify the role of positivity as a resiliency factor for individual adaptive functioning and a protective factor for young children’s positive development. The dissertation includes two studies: the first study examined the association between individuals’ <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> and positivity throughout adulthood and the second study examined the impact of parental positivity and positive parenting on child positive emotionality despite experiencing family <b>economic</b> <b>pressure.</b> The first study found that individuals’ <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> was negatively associated with their positivity from emerging adulthood to adulthood. The final optimized model suggests that individuals who generally showed higher positivity {{were less likely to}} feel <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> across time. The second study found that, in spite of <b>economic</b> <b>pressure,</b> parental positivity and positive parenting were associated with their young children’s positive emotionality at ages 3 to 5. The results of the two studies suggest that positivity, defined as an individual’s positive perspectives of self, others, and future can be a resiliency factor in times of adversity as well as a protective factor for young children’s positive development in spite of <b>economic</b> <b>pressure...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Previous {{research}} has examined {{costs associated with}} progressive neurological illnesses, but has not examined predictors of <b>economic</b> <b>pressure,</b> or quality of life (QOL). The aim {{of the current study}} was to examine the predictors of both <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> and QOL among people with a range of progressive neurological illness. Method: Participants were 257 people with motor neurone disease, Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s. Results: High levels of cut backs in spending predicted <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> for all groups. <b>Economic</b> <b>pressure</b> predicted QOL at 12 -month follow-up for all groups except Parkinson’s. For Parkinson’s, predictors of QOL were long duration of illness, illness-related expenses and cut backs in spending. Cut backs in spending, and not income or expenses, were the most important predictor of <b>economic</b> <b>pressure.</b> QOL was predicted by high levels of <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> for most of the illness groups. Discussion: The implications of these findings are discussed. They suggest that cut backs in spending, as opposed to income and expenses, are important factors to focus on assisting people to adjust to the changes to their financial situation that frequently occurs after developing one of these progressive neurological illnesses. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the impact of financial costs and self-reported <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> {{on the quality of}} life of patients with progressive neurological illness.

Participants completed measures of: 1. quality of life, 2. income, 3. expenses, 4. <b>economic</b> <b>pressure,</b> 5. social support, 6. relationship satisfaction, and 7. severity of illness. There was a strong negative association between quality of life and <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> (but not income or expenses) for all groups.

5|$|The 15th Battalion was an {{infantry}} {{battalion of}} the Australian Army. Formed in 1914 {{as part of}} the all-volunteer Australian Imperial Force from Queensland and Tasmanian recruits, the battalion fought during the Gallipoli Campaign and on the Western Front during the First World War. It was disbanded after the war in 1919, but later re-raised as a part-time Citizens Forces unit based in Queensland in 1921, consisting of a mixture of volunteers and conscripts. <b>Economic</b> <b>pressures</b> and limited manpower resulted in the battalion being amalgamated with other battalions a couple of times during the inter-war years. In mid-1939, as rising tensions in Europe led to an expansion of the Australian military, the battalion was re-formed in its own right. During the Second World War the 15th Battalion was mobilised for wartime service and initially undertook defensive duties in Australia before taking part in the fighting against the Japanese in New Guinea and Bougainville in 1943–1945. The battalion was disbanded in 1946 and never re-raised.|$|E
5|$|World War I {{broke out}} in July 1914. By September 1914, the war had spread to Africa as the British and Belgians began a long {{military}} campaign against the German colonial army in German East Africa. In Nyasaland, the major effect {{of the war was}} massive recruitment of Africans to serve as porters in support of the Allied armies. Porters lived in extremely poor conditions which left them exposed to disease and mortality rates among them during the campaigns were high. At the same time, the recruitment of porters created a shortage of labour which increased the <b>economic</b> <b>pressures</b> on Africans in Nyasaland. Millenarians at the time believed that World War I would be a form of Armageddon, which they believed would destroy the colonial powers and pave the way for the emergence of independent African states.|$|E
5|$|The Mikea {{live in a}} {{symbiotic}} relationship with the neighboring Masikoro farmers and herders, and the Vezo fishing clan. The Mikea live primarily on food scavenged from the forest but also grow seasonal crops. Their mobility and reliance on scavenging as opposed to crop growing shifts in response to changes in environmental and <b>economic</b> <b>pressures</b> on availability of resources within the Mikea {{community as well as}} those of their Vezo and Masikoro neighbors. The Mikea sell their forest products, as well as woven mats and food animals they raise, at weekly Vezo and Masikoro markets in nearby villages to obtain the necessities they cannot scavenge, such as clothing and medicine. Some Mikea migrate for periods of time to work in local villages or the town of Morombe. They are also hired to work for Vezo and Masikoro villagers, such as by cutting forest for villagers or other Mikeas' corn fields, or guarding villagers' zebu herds. They occasionally acquire one or more zebu in addition to or in lieu of payment, as these are seen as a form of wealth and are mainly sacrificed in ancestral ceremonies rather than eaten as food. The rainy season is the time when Mikea are most likely to leave their scavenging encampments for wage labor opportunities in villages or for the corn harvest. This is also the time when Masikoro and Vezo villagers are most likely to move into the forest to grow corn.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze the {{influence}} of family characteristics and <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> on coping strategies of farmer families in flash flood areas, Kebumen District. Farmer families that involved {{in the study were}} 100 families consisting of 50 families from the village of Kemujan and 50 families from the village of Tegalsari. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, different t test, and multiple linear regression. Farmer family perceived the <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> of their family in the medium category. Economic coping strategies which were done by farmer family are also classified as moderate, but the intensity of coping strategies done by farmer family was categorized into low level. <b>Economic</b> <b>pressure</b> of family increases with the number of family burden and the type of government assistance that has been received. In contrast, the <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> decreases as the increase of home-grounds and also the change of ownership status of the house. <b>Economic</b> <b>pressure</b> of family affects the coping strategies both in number and intensity. Another factor that determines coping strategies of family is the age of the husband, the husbands’ side job, and the wife's work. The number and intensity of coping strategies that family has will increase in line with the age of husband and a condition when wife has a job. The number of coping strategies done by family also increases if husband has side job.
