25|$|A {{thylakoid}} is a membrane-bound compartment inside chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. They are {{the site}} of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. Thylakoids consist of a thylakoid membrane surrounding a thylakoid lumen. Chloroplast thylakoids frequently form stacks of disks referred to as grana (singular: <b>granum).</b> Grana are connected by intergranal or stroma thylakoids, which join <b>granum</b> stacks together as a single functional compartment.|$|E
25|$|Thylakoids are membrane-bound {{structures}} {{embedded in}} the chloroplast stroma. A stack of thylakoids is called a <b>granum</b> and resembles a stack of coins.|$|E
25|$|The {{thylakoid}} membranes of the cyanobacteria are not differentiated into <b>granum</b> and stroma regions as {{observed in}} plants. They form stacks of parallel sheets {{close to the}} cytoplasmic membrane with a low packing density. The relatively large distance between the thylakoids provides space for the external light harvesting antennae, the phycobilisomes. This macrostructure, {{as in the case}} of higher plants, shows some flexibility during changes in the physicochemical environment.|$|E
25|$|In higher plants thylakoids are {{organized}} into a granum-stroma membrane assembly. A <b>granum</b> (plural grana) is {{a stack of}} thylakoid discs. Chloroplasts can have from 10 to 100 grana. Grana are connected by stroma thylakoids, also called intergranal thylakoids or lamellae. Grana thylakoids and stroma thylakoids can be distinguished by their different protein composition. Grana contribute to chloroplasts' large surface area to volume ratio. Different interpretations of electron tomography imaging of thylakoid membranes has resulted in two models for grana structure. Both posit that lamellae intersect grana stacks in parallel sheets, though whether these sheets intersect in planes perpendicular to the grana stack axis, or are arranged in a right-handed helix is debated.|$|E
25|$|In the helical {{thylakoid}} model, grana {{consist of}} a stack of flattened circular granal thylakoids that resemble pancakes. Each <b>granum</b> can contain anywhere from two to a hundred thylakoids, though grana with 10–20 thylakoids are most common. Wrapped around the grana are helicoid stromal thylakoids, also known as frets or lamellar thylakoids. The helices ascend at an angle of 20–25°, connecting to each granal thylakoid at a bridge-like slit junction. The helicoids may extend as large sheets that link multiple grana, or narrow to tube-like bridges between grana. While {{different parts of the}} thylakoid system contain different membrane proteins, the thylakoid membranes are continuous and the thylakoid space they enclose form a single continuous labyrinth.|$|E

The province's largest and smallest towns by population are Okotoks and <b>Granum</b> with 28,881 and 406 respectively, while its largest and smallest by land area are Drumheller and Eckville with [...] and [...] respectively. Thorsby is Alberta's newest town, which changed from a village to a town on January 1, 2017.|$|E
2500|$|For a long time, the {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of the}} thylakoid system has been unknown or disputed. One model has the <b>granum</b> as a stack of thylakoids linked by helical stromal thylakoids; the other has the <b>granum</b> as a single folded thylakoid connected in a [...] "hub and spoke" [...] way to other grana by stromal thylakoids. While the thylakoid system is still commonly depicted according to the folded thylakoid model, it was determined in 2011 that the stacked and helical thylakoids model is correct.|$|E
2500|$|The word jarā {{is related}} to the older Vedic Sanskrit word jarā, jaras, jarati, gerā, which means [...] "to become brittle, to decay, to be consumed". The Vedic root {{is related to}} the Latin <b>granum,</b> Goth. kaurn, Greek geras, geros (later geriatric) all of which in one context mean [...] "hardening, old age".|$|E
2500|$|The word garnet {{comes from}} the 14th‑century Middle English word gernet, meaning 'dark red'. It is derived [...] from the Latin granatus, from <b>granum</b> ('grain, seed'). This is {{possibly}} a reference to mela granatum or even pomum granatum ('pomegranate', Punica granatum), a plant whose fruits contain abundant and vivid red seed covers (arils), which are similar in shape, size, and color to some garnet crystals.|$|E
6000|$|... 750. ~of sorry grain~, not brilliant, of poor colour. 'Grain' is from Lat. <b>granum,</b> a seed, {{applied to}} small objects, and hence to the coccus or {{cochineal}} insect which yields {{a variety of}} red dyes. Hence grain came to denote certain colours, e.g. Tyrian purple, violet, etc., and is so used by Milton: see Il Pens. 33, [...] "a robe of darkest grain"; Par. Lost, v. 285, [...] "sky-tinctured grain"; xi. 242, [...] "A military vest of purple ... Livelier than ... the grain Of Sarra," [...] etc. And as these were fast or durable colours we have such phrases as 'to dye in grain,' 'a rogue in grain,' 'an ingrained habit.' (See further in Marsh's Lect. on Eng. Lang. p. 55).|$|E
6000|$|Some of {{the chiefs}} had copper rings of home manufacture, with neatly cut raised figures. The king {{held in his}} right hand an article which at first puzzled us--a foot's length of split reed, with the bulbous root attached. He may not, like his vassals, point with the finger, and without {{pointing}} an African can hardly give an order. Moreover, the Sangálávú or Malaguetta pepper (Amomum <b>granum</b> Paradisi), fresh or old, is not only a toothstick, but a fetish of superior power when carried on journeys. Professor Smith writes [...] "Sangala woo," [...] and tells us that it was always kept fresh in the house, to be rolled in the hands when invoking the Fetish during war-time; moreover, it was chewed to be spat at the enemy. Possibly he confuses it with the use as a tooth-stick, the article which Asia and Africa prefer to the unclean hog's- bristle brush of Europe.|$|E
60|$|Patriotic Barbot (1700), {{in company}} with the mariner Villault de Belfons, Père Labat, and Ernest de Fréville, [Footnote: Mémoire sur le Commerce Maritime de Rouen.] claims the honour for France. According to that 'chief factor for the African Company,' the merchants of Dieppe first traded to West Africa for {{cardamoms}} and ivory. This was {{during the reign of}} Charles V., and between 1364 and 1430, or half a century before the Portuguese. Their chief stations were Goree of Cape Verde, Sierra Leone, Cape Mount, the Kru or Liberian coast, then called 'of Grain,' from the 'Guinea grains' or Malaguetta pepper (Amomum <b>granum</b> Paradisi), and, lastly, the Gold Coast. Here they founded 'Petit Paris' upon the Baie de France, at 'Serrelionne;' 'Petit Dieppe,' {{at the mouth of the}} St. John's River, near Grand Bassá, south of Monrovia; and 'Cestro' [Footnote: Now generally called Grand Sestros, and popularly derived from the Portuguese cestos--pepper.] or 'Sestro Paris,' where, three centuries afterwards, the natives retained a few words of French. Hence Admiral Bouet-Willaumez explains the Great and Little 'Boutoo' of our charts by butteau, from butte, the old Norman word still preserved in the great western prairies.|$|E
60|$|We are wont {{to forget}} that the sun looks on our {{cultivated}} fields and on the prairies and forests without distinction. They all reflect and absorb his rays alike, and the former make but {{a small part of}} the glorious picture which he beholds in his daily course. In his view the earth is all equally cultivated like a garden. Therefore we should receive the benefit of his light and heat with a corresponding trust and magnanimity. What though I value the seed of these beans, and harvest that in the fall of the year? This broad field which I have looked at so long looks not to me as the principal cultivator, but away from me to influences more genial to it, which water and make it green. These beans have results which are not harvested by me. Do they not grow for woodchucks partly? The ear of wheat (in Latin spica, obsoletely speca, from spe, hope) should not be the only hope of the husbandman; its kernel or grain (<b>granum</b> from gerendo, bearing) is not all that it bears. How, then, can our harvest fail? Shall I not rejoice also at the abundance of the weeds whose seeds are the granary of the birds? It matters little comparatively whether the fields fill the farmer's barns. The true husbandman will cease from anxiety, as the squirrels manifest no concern whether the woods will bear chestnuts this year or not, and finish his labor with every day, relinquishing all claim to the produce of his fields, and sacrificing in his mind not only his first but his last fruits also.|$|E
