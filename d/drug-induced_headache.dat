40|$|Four hundred {{patients}} {{attending a}} headache clinic were classified using the IHS criteria. The majority required more than two, often three or four, diagnoses. Even though migraine {{was the most}} common diagnosis, only 114 of those with a migraine diagnosis had it as the only diagnosis. Seventy-five percent of migraine patients had coexistent chronic tension-type headache (CTTH), <b>drug-induced</b> <b>headache</b> or both. Ninety-six percent of patients diagnosed as having migraine with aura also suffered from migraine without aura. More than 113 of patients (37. 7 %) attending the clinic suffered from chronic daily headache (CDH) (chronic cluster headache excluded), which is not included as a separate entity in the IHS classification. Pure CTTH formed only a small minority of CDH, whereas 86. 6 % of CDH had migraine as one of the diagnoses. <b>Drug-induced</b> <b>headache</b> was a prominent second or third diagnosis. The advantages and disadvantages of multiple verses single diagnosis in CDH and the need to recognize the natural history of headache disorders in the classification are discussed. 0 Chronic daily headache, chronic tension-type headache, <b>drug-induced</b> <b>headache,</b> headache clinic, IHS classification, migrain...|$|E
40|$|Medication Overuse Headache (MOH) was {{previously}} termed analgesic rebound headache, <b>drug-induced</b> <b>headache,</b> and medication-misuse headache. It {{is not a}} primary headache but frequently coexists with primary chronic daily headache. All acute symptomatic medications used to treat headaches {{have the potential for}} causing MOH. Highest with opioids, butalbital-containing combination analgesics, and aspirin/ acetaminophen/caffeine combinations. The development is typically preceded by an episodic headache disorder, usually migraine or tension-type headache, that has been treated with frequent and excessive amounts of acute symptomatic medications. The diagnosis is based upon clinical impression. A history of analgesic use averaging more than two to three days per week in association with chronic daily headache is suggestive. The diagnosis is made when the pattern of frequent headaches fulfills the diagnostic criteria for MOH. The basic steps in the management: Patient education, withdrawal of the offending medication, bridge (transitional) therapy, establishment of a headache treatment regimen covering acute and preventive care, follow up and relapse prevention...|$|E
40|$|The 1988 {{classification}} by the International Headache Society (IHS) first defined <b>drug-induced</b> <b>headache</b> as {{a specific}} disorder, belonging to secondary headaches, subtype 8. 2 (headache induced by chronic substance use or exposure). In 2004 ICHD-II, this definition was replaced by medication-overuse headache (MOH). It was established that a definite diagnosis of MOH required {{the improvement of the}} disorder after cessation of medication overuse. The specific characteristics of the various subforms were also indicated. Later revisions have first eliminated these headache characteristics and then the diagnosis of probable MOH. The diagnosis of MOH has therefore become more useful to clinical aims. However, the last revision has eliminated the need to prove that the disorder is caused by drugs, that is, the headache improves after cessation of medication overuse. The classification of MOH as a secondary headache has therefore been modified, too. Clinical trials can consequently include in the same group patients with primary headache and drug overuse and patients with MOH. We therefore propose to continue to use the diagnosis of probable MOH to research aims. We also propose to modify the classification of MOH subforms according to {{the presence or absence of}} a dependence-producing property of overused drugs. This will allow to better analyze the role of the various medications in inducing chronic headache and the outcomes of treatments...|$|E
40|$|Management of {{migraine}} {{patients with}} or without aura must include appropriate medication to treat the attack and long-term preventive therapy, especially if {{the frequency of the}} attacks is greater than 2 - 4 per month. In both cases the choice of treatment depends on its efficacy and side effects. With regard to acute drug therapy, group studies do not suggest that ergot derivatives and sumatriptan are superior to simple analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly if a prokinetic agent is added. These new substances are indicated for severe attacks refractory to more conventional therapy. Chronic drug abuse may induce <b>drug-induced</b> or rebound <b>headaches.</b> As regards long-term prophylaxis, group studies suggest that calcium antagonists and 5 -HT-influencing drugs are superior concerning attacks frequency to beta-blocking agents, but involve very frequent side effects (weight gain and somnolence). Interesting preliminary results have also been reported with valproate and enalapril, which will confirmation by controlled studies. Finally, the choice of drug must take into account the patient's comorbidities (cardiovascular diseases, asthma, diabetes etc) ...|$|R
40|$|Population-based {{studies suggest}} that the {{prevalence}} of chronic daily headache is 3 - 5 %(1, 2). Drug-induced headaches are {{the most common cause of}} chronic daily headache. Fifty to 86 % of chronic daily headaches have been attributed to overuse of analgesic and abortive medications (2 - 5). Yet, medication-overuse headache (MOH), also called <b>drug-induced</b> <b>headache</b> and analgesic-rebound headache, continues to be inadequately addressed in clinical practice. In a 1996 survey of family practice physicians in the US, MOH was reported to be the 3 rd most common form of headache observed in practice(6). The International Headache Society (HIS) defines medication-overuse headache (MOH) as a chronic headache (headache frequency> 15 days per month) after the intake of analgesics or ergots (more than 15 times per month for at least 3 months), which disappears after withdrawal therapy(7). It has been described as "a self-sustaining, rhythmic, headache-medication cycle characterized by daily or near daily headache and irresistible and predictable use of immediate relief medications"(3). Evidence supporting the existence of MOH is widely published in the medical literature. However, few quality, controlled trials have investigated the epidemiology, risk factors, and drug histories of patients with drug-induced headaches. The pathogenesis of MOH has not been fully elucidated. Some evidence suggests that up-regulation of serotonin receptors and subsequent reduction in serotonin levels, which normalize upon cessation of chronic analgesic use, may play a role(3). The following have also been implicated in the development of MOH...|$|E
40|$|The European Neurological Network is a European Economic Community {{supported}} project. The {{purpose of}} the project was to develop a multimedia educational tool for general practitioners in order to improve their management of sleep disorders, epilepsy and headache. The project involves approximately one hundred engineers and physicians from Belgium, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain. This paper concerns the multimedia educational tool on headache. The system consists of five different modules, i. e. classification, clinical data, headache tutorial, diagnostic headache diary and nomenclature. It is possible to move between the modules both vertically and horizontally. The headache classification of the International Headache Society is provided in full text as a work of reference. This classification is used world wide and has been adopted by International Classification of Diseases 10 Neurological Adaptation (ICD- 10 NA) and the World Health Organisation. The clinical data concentrate on migraine and tension-type headache, the two most common headache disorders, but data on familial hemiplegic migraine, cluster headache, <b>drug-induced</b> <b>headache</b> and secondary headaches are also available. The headache tutorial consists of case records that the user can test their diagnostic abilities on. The diagnostic headache diary is an expert system on headache diagnostics. It can be filled in during a consultation in order to provide the headache diagnosis or it can be printed and used by the headache patient to record headache attacks and medicine consumption. The nomenclature module provides an explanation of words and expressions used in the system. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Frequent episodic tension-type {{headache}} (ETTH) is {{a serious}} medical problem that is primarily due to its high prevalence. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) whose efficiency {{is determined by the}} rapid and complete regression of cephalgia are primarily used to relieve an ETTH attack. One of the ways to enhance the effect of NSAIDs is their combination with agents that accelerate their absorption or potentiate their action, with caffeine in particular; however, the use of combination agents is limited by a risk for <b>drug-induced</b> <b>headache.</b> A step {{on the road to the}} design of effective and safe analgesics has been the development of the combination drug Novigan that contains ibuprofen (400 mg) and the spasmolytics pitofenone (5 mg) and fenpiverinium (0. 1 mg). Objective: to study the efficacy of Novigan versus ibuprofen 400 mg in relieving an ETTH attack. Subjects and methods. Fifty patients (mean age 37. 1 ± 10. 9 years) with frequent ETTH that met the criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2 nd Edition, were examined. For relief of ETTH attacks, 30 patients used Novigan and 20 took ibuprofen in a dose of 400 mg. Results. There was a significant reduction in the intensity of cephalgia 49. 9 ± 35. 8 and 68. 2 ± 45. 9 min after drug administration in the Novigan and ibuprofen 400 mg groups, respectively (p = 0. 007). The proportion of respondents was higher in the Novigan group (73. 3 %) than that in the ibuprofen 400 mg group (60 %), which is close to the statistically significant difference (p = 0. 085). The efficacy predictors were less pain intensity (p < 0. 001) and a shorter time after onset (p < 0. 001) in the ibuprofen 400 mg group at administration of the drug and only less pain intensity in the Novigan group at that moment (p = 0. 07). Conclusion. Novigan is a combination analgesic that rapidly and effectively relieves an ETTH attack, including that of high intensity, as well as extended ETTH attack...|$|E
