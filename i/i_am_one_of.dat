John Le Mesurier described Jacques as [...] "a remarkable lady... had an aura of love and kindness about her", while her obituary in The Times observed that [...] "she will be remembered with affection by all who saw her". A month after the funeral, a memorial service was held at St Paul's, Covent Garden, otherwise known as the Actors' Church, which was described by Le Mesurier as a [...] "joyous occasion".|$|E
500|$|Observers {{described}} the Reagans' relationship as close, authentic and intimate. During his presidency they {{were reported to}} frequently display their affection for one another; one press secretary said, [...] "They never took each other for granted. They never stopped courting." [...] He often called her [...] "Mommy" [...] and she called him [...] "Ronnie." [...] He once wrote to her, [...] "Whatever I treasure and enjoy... all would be without meaning if I didn't have you." [...] When {{he was in the}} hospital in 1981 after an assassination attempt, she slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by his scent. In a letter to the American people in 1994, Reagan wrote [...] "I have recently been told that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease... I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience," [...] and in 1998, while he was stricken by Alzheimer's, Nancy told Vanity Fair, [...] "Our relationship is very special. We were very much in love and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life without him." [...] Nancy Reagan died on March 6, 2016 at the age of 94.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} for the New Statesman magazine in June 2000, Tebbit praised Hague's right-ward shift and revealed that he had [...] "never been a [...] Portillo fan". He also mused on not standing for the Conservative leadership after Thatcher's resignation: [...] "When I {{look at what happened}} to the party, I tell myself that perhaps I failed in a duty. I suppose <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those who have it on my conscience that I allowed Mr Blair to become Prime Minister".

Sometimes I am accused of being overbearing because I am opinionated and do not flinch from expressing my views.

2500|$|Pipes was a firm {{supporter}} of the Vietnam War, and when his fellow students occupied the Harvard administration building to protest it in the 1960s, he sided with the administration. Pipes had previously considered {{himself to be a}} Democrat, but after anti-war George McGovern gained the 1972 Democratic nomination for President, he switched to the Republican Party. Pipes used to accept being described as a [...] "neoconservative", once saying that [...] "others see me that way, and, you know, maybe <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them." [...] However, he explicitly rejected the label in April 2009 due to differences with the neoconservative positions on democracy and Iraq, now considering himself a [...] "plain conservative".|$|E
2500|$|Concluding his {{extensive}} reply dated 27 October 2009 to the Prime Minister, Dr Swire said: [...] "You have now received {{a much more}} comprehensive letter requesting a full inquiry from our group 'UK Families-Flight 103'. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the signatories. I hope that the contents of this letter underline {{some of the reasons}} as to why I cannot possibly accept that any inquiry should be limited to Scotland, and I apologise if my previous personal letter of 24 August misled you over the main focus that the inquiry will need to address. That focus lies in London and {{at the door of the}} then inhabitant of Number 10 Downing Street. I look forward to hearing your comments both to our group's letter and to the contents of this one." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 12 April 2006, Afridi {{announced}} a temporary retirement from Test cricket {{so that he}} could concentrate on ODIs, with a particular focus on the 2007 World Cup, and {{to spend more time with}} his family. He said he would consider reversing his decision after the World Cup. Afridi had played ten Tests since being recalled to the side in January 2005, averaging 47.44 with the bat including four centuries. However, on 27 April he reversed his decision, saying that [...] " [...] told me that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the main players in the team and squad and that Pakistan really needed me". Before Pakistan toured England in July to September, Afridi played for Ireland as an overseas player in the C Trophy. In six matches, he scored 128runs and took seven wickets. England won the four-match Test series 3–0; Afridi played two matches, scoring 49runs and took three wickets. It was the last Test cricket Afridi played until 2010.|$|E
