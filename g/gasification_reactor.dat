40|$|Indirect biomass {{gasification}} systems {{consist of}} two reactors: an oxidation reactor and a <b>gasification</b> <b>reactor.</b> A bed-material {{is used to}} transfer heat from the oxidation to the <b>gasification</b> <b>reactor.</b> Olivine has been widely studied as a reactive bed-material for this process. The iron in olivine {{can act as a}} catalyst for the decomposition of tars, produced during the gasification process. Moreover, iron is capable of transferring oxygen to the <b>gasification</b> <b>reactor.</b> In this study, we elucidate the role of iron in this chemical looping process. Mössbauer spectra show that during oxidation in O 2 /Ar at 750 °C, iron segregates out of the olivine matrix forming free iron oxide phases. These free iron phases form metallic iron upon subsequent reduction in hydrogen. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) is used to quantify oxygen transport under alternating oxidizing/reducing conditions. TGA results indicate that at least 18 % of all the iron, present in olivine, is capable of transferring oxygen on the time scale of minutes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) combined with depth profiling provides insight in the dynamic behavior of olivine under relevant conditions. Iron enrichment at the surface is observed; oxidized olivine has an iron rich surface layer of 400 nm. The increased iron concentration is particularly pronounced at the outermost surface. Upon subsequent reduction, the iron quickly redistributes in the olivine toward the original, homogeneous distribution. These results show that oxygen transport should be taken into account when olivine is evaluated as a catalyst for indirect biomass gasification. Furthermore, both oxygen transport and catalytic properties are heavily dependent on the iron phases present in the material, which in turn depend on the gas environment...|$|E

40|$|Gas Technology Institute is {{developing}} a novel concept of membrane gasifier for high efficiency, clean and low cost production of hydrogen from coal.

The objective of this project {{is to determine the}} technical and economic feasibility of this concept by screening, testing and identifying potential candidate membranes under high temperature, high pressure, and harsh environments of the coal gasification conditions. The best performing membranes will be selected for preliminary reactor design and cost estimates. To evaluate the performances of the candidate membranes under the gasification conditions, a high temperature/high pressure hydrogen permeation unit has been constructed in this project. During this reporting period, the unit has been fully commissioned and is operational. The unit is capable of operating at temperatures up to 1100 C and pressures to 60 atm for evaluation of ceramic membranes such as mixed ionic conducting membrane. A double-seal technique has been developed and tested successfully to achieve leak-tight seal for the membranes. Initial data for a commercial Palladium-Gold membrane were obtained at temperatures to 450 C and pressures to 13 atm. Tests for the perovskite membranes are being performed and the results will be reported in the next quarter. A membrane <b>gasification</b> <b>reactor</b> model was developed to consider the H{sub 2 } permeability of the membrane, the kinetics and the equilibriums of the gas phase reactions in the gasifier, the operating conditions and the configurations of the membrane reactor.

This confirms the previous evaluation results from the thermodynamic equilibrium calculation. A rigorous model for hydrogen permeation through mixed proton-electron conducting ceramic membranes was also developed based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The results from the simulation work confirm that the hydrogen flux increases with increasing partial pressure of hydrogen.

40|$|Dual {{fluidized}} bed reactor for steam gasification of {{biomass is a}} promising technology {{and can be used}} in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) production. The producer gas from the reactor can have a calorific value up to 14 MJ/Nm 3. The technology is well known for the comparative high efficiency and is neutral to CO 2 emission. Although the dual {{fluidized bed}} reactor has gained advantages compared to corresponding reactors, the technology has to be improved to become competitive in the world energy market. The current project is focused on optimization of flow behavior and reaction kinetics in the <b>gasification</b> <b>reactor</b> to improve the reactor performance. The study of fluid dynamics and thermo-chemical behavior is performed using experimental and computational methods. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) and Computational Particle Fluid Dynamic (CPFD) models are used in the study. The dual fluidized bed gasification technology consists of a bubbling fluidized bed reactor and circulating fluidized bed reactor. The experimental and computational studies are carried out for both types of reactors. A CFD model is validated against the experimental measurements in a cold flow model of bubbling fluidized bed reactor. Good agreements were obtained between computational and experimental minimum fluidization velocities and pressure drops. The <b>gasification</b> <b>reactor</b> at high temperature conditions is simulated using the validated CFD model. The CFD model is also used for verification of Glicksman’s full set and simplified set of dimensionless parameters for scaling of biomass gasification reactors. In addition, the model is used to study Glicksman’s viscous limit set of dimensionless scaling parameters. The computational results show that Glicksman’s viscous limit set of dimensionless parameters is applicable for scaling of fluidized beds operating at particle Reynold’s number up to 15. The CPFD model is used to simulate reaction and reaction kinetics in the <b>gasification</b> <b>reactor.</b> The computational results of composition of the producer gas agree well with the measured gas compositions reported from the biomass gasification plant in Güssing, Austria. Circulation rate of bed material, steam to biomass ratio, bed material to biomass ratio and the corresponding temperatures are important for optimization of the <b>gasification</b> <b>reactor.</b> The CPFD model is used to study these parameters. The results show that the optimum bed material circulation rate is about 26 times of the biomass feed, the steam to biomass ratio is 0. 2 on mass basis and the optimal reaction temperature is 1173 K. The results make a contribution to meet a challenge of increasing the steam conversion rate. Steam production for the biomass <b>gasification</b> <b>reactor</b> requires significant amount of energy. Various gasification data show the steam conversion rate is lower than 10 vol. % [1, 2]. The rest of the 90 vol. % of steam is used only as fluidizing gas. The reduction of particle size of biomass and bed material significantly reduces the amount of steam required for the fluidization. The computational results based on the CPFD model show that decreasing particle size of bed material and the wood increases the producer gas quantity. Experiments have been performed in a lab-scale cold model of a Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) reactor. Pressure data and bed material circulation rates show good agreements with the computational results. The CPFD model is used for optimization of gas feed positon in the CFB reactor in order to obtain maximum bed material circulation rate. The results of the CPFD simulations show that the optimum ratio of the heights of the feed position for the primary and secondary gas to the total height of the reactor are 0. 125 and 0. 375 respectively. The optimization of the flow in the CFB needs identification of all flow regimes occurring in the reactor. The flow regimes have been identified along with the minimum fluidization, transport and fast fluidization velocities for glass particles with mean particle size of 156 μm. The CPFD model prediction shows that the gas velocity range of 10 umf to 35 umf should be avoided to maintain constant bed material circulation rate in CFB...|$|E
