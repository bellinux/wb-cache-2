2500|$|In {{response}} to Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell's {{opposition to the}} nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court, of which Falwell had said, [...] "Every good Christian should be concerned", Goldwater retorted: [...] "Every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass." [...] (According to John Dean, Goldwater actually suggested that good Christians ought to kick Falwell in the [...] "nuts", but the news media [...] "changed the anatomical reference.") Goldwater also had harsh words for his one-time political protegé, President Reagan, particularly after the Iran–Contra Affair became public in 1986. Journalist Robert MacNeil, a friend of Goldwater's from the 1964 Presidential campaign, recalled interviewing him in his office shortly afterward. [...] "He {{was sitting in his}} office with his hands on his cane... and he said to me, 'Well, aren't you going to ask me about the Iran arms sales?' It had just been announced that the Reagan administration had sold arms to Iran. And I said, 'Well, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you, what would you say?' He said, 'I'd say it's the god-damned stupidest foreign policy blunder this country's ever made!'", though aside from the Iran–Contra scandal, Goldwater thought nonetheless that Reagan was a good president. In 1988 during that year's [...] presidential campaign, he pointedly told vice-presidential nominee Dan Quayle at a campaign event in Arizona [...] "I want you to go back and tell George Bush to start talking about the issues." ...|$|E
60|$|I asked Aunt Alice to beg {{you to come}} here. I {{was afraid}} you wouldn't <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you.|$|E
6000|$|... "How daring," [...] Maggie murmured, [...] "and how wonderfully original! What {{should you}} say, now, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you if my nose wanted powdering?" ...|$|E
60|$|As {{compared}} with other actual Universities, then, Aberdeen, may, perhaps, be well satisfied with itself. But do not think me an impracticable dreamer, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you not to rest and be thankful in this state of satisfaction; <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to consider awhile, how this actual good stands related to that ideal better, towards which both men and institutions must progress, if they would not retrograde.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh no;--not to stay. Of course <b>I</b> must <b>ask</b> my husband. I'm sure he'll {{let me go}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> it, but not to-morrow. Why to-morrow?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These {{are fine}} children," [...] said he. [...] "May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> they are your own?-- Pardon me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> amiss," [...] added he, seeing a frown on the Doctor's brow.|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{you to go}} in thither yourself, and try the mettle and {{the luck}} which, they say, never failed Hereward yet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, they'd go {{quick enough}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> them {{up here in}} the country. Etiquette don't count with them when they're on a vacation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{look very}} comfortable, dear Mr. Lomas,' she retorted. 'Would you mind very much <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{you to put}} my {{footstool}} right for me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would {{you feel}} insulted <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> whether your breakfast {{is to be}} sent up, or kept waiting till you choose to come down?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The journey {{will put}} you to some expense," [...] the {{merchant}} replied. [...] "Pardon me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> the question bluntly. Have you money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] he answered, rather taken aback. [...] "But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> Edgar, he'll {{always come}} with us, {{and then they}} can say nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't care. I {{think he}} ought to see Lucy, and since he'd refuse <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him, I'm not going to give him the chance.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll be {{frivolous}} enough {{later on}} this evening. I've been wondering if you'd think it impertinent <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{you to tell me}} about your guardian." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{girl looked}} at him steadily. “I have trusted you, Mr. Appleby. Would it be too much <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you to take me into your confidence?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will not}} think me foolish <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to wait here while I go in there"--she {{pointed to the}} ominous thicket near them--"alone?" ...|$|R
30|$|<b>If</b> <b>I</b> {{started out}} <b>asking</b> {{questions}} when <b>I</b> had {{questions from the}} beginning, she would have probably taught me {{and we would have}} been closer. But <b>I</b> haven’t <b>asked</b> what <b>I</b> didn’t know, and <b>I</b> kept not <b>asking</b> until now, you know. So I feel a little like, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> now, she may think that I am so stupid.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{know what}} I mean,' said Alethea, 'and pray {{do not be}} displeased <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you not to make it {{difficult}} for Marianne to behave properly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{the other}} eagerly assented. [...] "I was told, at your county seat, that I could learn {{all about it}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> for Squire Braile, here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Desmond {{looked hard}} at him--but {{it was already}} almost dark. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "we're rather old friends. Would it be too much <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you why?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid he}} wouldn't," [...] replied Mary, doubtfully, [...] "and I think he'd only laugh <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him. He seemed glad {{when he thought}} he had escaped the celebration." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{drew closer}} to him, her hands upon his shoulders. [...] "Yet <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you--I, your wife?" [...] she pleaded, and almost won {{him to her}} will.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you won't {{leave me}} alone?" [...] she begged--"not even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> {{to be left}} alone? You see--I can't make you understand--but I don't even trust myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you, no. I am not thirsty. Ice-water is not {{necessary}} to my happiness. You will pardon me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> to be left alone--with my nerves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{guess my}} father might {{give me one}} or two <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> 'em," [...] Harvey replied. He had been too busy to think much of his family till then.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jealousy!" [...] he cried. [...] "Jealousy! Just as though--Can't I have {{letters about}} things you don't understand--that you won't understand? <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{you to read}} them you wouldn't--It's just because--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I may be wrong," [...] Bellamy {{continued}} slowly, [...] "but I {{believe that}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{you a question}} and it concerned some Germans and Austrians you would tell me the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you shall}} not be <b>asked.</b> <b>I</b> will not be cruel to you. But do you not know that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> {{anything}} it is {{with a view to}} your own good?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{girl did}} as he suggested, and his smile faded. [...] "Now," [...] he went on, [...] "you won't be {{astonished}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> you will marry me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly {{it is very}} considerable,' Merton said, after a {{few minutes}} passed in arithmetical calculation. 'Am <b>I</b> too curious <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> what is the source of this opulence?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then could you--would you mind--would it {{be giving}} {{you too much}} trouble <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you to shout 'Boo!' at him when he is making his stroke, if he looks like winning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I gather," [...] {{said the}} Colonel with a smile, [...] "that {{you do not}} like Miss Fregelius. As my {{acquaintance}} with her is limited, would you think me rude <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> why?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have a plan}} in my mind," [...] he said slowly. [...] "Duke, should I {{be taking}} a liberty <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{to be left alone}} with this young man for five minutes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see very}} little to criticise," [...] I said, [...] "from your point of view; but I hope you won't think it indiscreet <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> a few questions?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Once I {{was eager}} to persuade {{you to come to}} church to hear me; will you think it strange <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you not to come on this occasion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will not}} think me foolish <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to wait here while I go in there"--she {{pointed to the}} ominous thicket near them--"alone?" [...] She was quite white.|$|R
