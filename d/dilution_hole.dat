40|$|A 3 D {{algebraic}} grid generation {{scheme is}} presented for generating the grid points inside gas turbine combustors with inclined slots. The scheme {{is based on}} the 2 D transfinite interpolation method. Since the scheme is a 2 D approach, it is very efficient and can easily be extended to gas turbine combustors with either <b>dilution</b> <b>hole</b> or slot configurations. To demonstrate the feasibility and the usefulness of the technique, a numerical study of the quick-quench/lean-combustion (QQ/LC) zones of a staged turbine combustor is given. Preliminary results illustrate some of the major features of the flow and temperature fields in the QQ/LC zones. Formation of co- and counter-rotating bulk flow and shape temperature fields can be observed clearly, and the resulting patterns are consistent with experimental observations typical of the confined slanted jet-in-cross flow.

The computational approach attempts to strike a reasonable balance to handle the competing aspects of the complicated physical and chemical interactions of the flow, and the requirements in resolving the three-dimensional geometrical constraints of the combustor contours, film cooling slots, and circular dilution holes. The algorithm employs non-orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, second-order accurate discretizations, multigrid iterative solution procedure, the standard k-ε turbulence model, and a combustion model comprising of an assumed probability density function and the conserved scalar variable formulation. To assess {{the performance of the}} numerical algorithm, three different annular combustor flows with in-house experimental measurements are investigated. Overall, it is found that good theory/data agreement of the characteristic temperature pattern in the exit plane can be obtained. The influence of changing the <b>dilution</b> <b>hole</b> arrangements on the combustor performance is well predicted. The complicated mixing process can be better understood with more detailed information supplied by the numerical simulation. It is concluded that for the normal operating condition where the physical process is likely to be dominant, the performance of a gas turbine combustor can be predicted by the present methodology. © 1989...|$|E
40|$|Requirements {{to limit}} {{pollutant}} emissions {{from the gas}} turbine engines for the future High-Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) have led to consideration of various low-emission combustor concepts. One such concept is the Integrated Mixer-Flame Holder (IMFH). This report describes a series of IMFH analyses performed with KIVA-II, a multi-dimensional CFD code for problems involving sprays, turbulence, and combustion. To {{meet the needs of}} this study, KIVA-II's boundary condition and chemistry treatments are modified. The study itself examines the relationships between fuel vaporization, fuel-air mixing, and combustion. Parameters being considered include: mixer tube diameter, mixer tube length, mixer tube geometry (converging-diverging versus straight walls), air inlet velocity, air inlet swirl angle, secondary air injection (dilution holes), fuel injection velocity, fuel injection angle, number of fuel injection ports, fuel spray cone angle, and fuel droplet size. Cases are run with and without combustion to examine the variations in fuel-air mixing and potential for flashback due to the above parameters. The degree of fuel-air mixing is judged by comparing average, minimum, and maximum fuel/air ratios at the exit of the mixer tube, while flame stability is monitored by following the location of the flame front as the solution progresses from ignition to steady state. Results indicate that fuel-air mixing can be enhanced by a variety of means, the best being a combination of air inlet swirl and a converging-diverging mixer tube geometry. With the IMFH configuration utilized in the present study, flashback becomes more common as the mixer tube diameter is increased and is instigated by disturbances associated with the <b>dilution</b> <b>hole</b> flow...|$|E

The present paper aims to study <b>dilution</b> <b>holes</b> including primary <b>dilution</b> <b>holes</b> and secondary <b>dilution</b> <b>holes</b> on the performance of a triple swirler combustor. Experimental investigations are conducted at different inlet airflow velocities (40 – 70  m/s) and combustor overall fuel–air ratio with fixed inlet airflow temperature (473  K) and atmospheric pressure. The experimental results show that the ignition is very difficult with specific performance of high ignition fuel–air ratio when the primary <b>dilution</b> <b>holes</b> are located 0. 6 H (where H is the liner dome height) downstream the dome, while the other four cases have almost the same ignition performance.

40|$|The {{mixing process}} within the {{dilution}} zone noticeably affects the temperature {{field in the}} outlet section of a gas turbine combustor. In fact, dilution jets lower {{the temperature of the}} hot flow exiting the primary zone establishing suitable temperature profile and pattern factor at the combustor outlet. Thus, the dilution zone design has a significant impact on performance and durability of the turbine. In this study, a dual fuel gas turbine combustor is investigated by a commercial finite-volume CFD code. The computational domain extends from the compressor discharge to the gas turbine inlet and it is meshed with a coarse grid since it was originally conceived for thermoacoustic analysis. The model has been already validated throughout measurements acquired during full scale isothermal and reactive tests. On the basis of the results of reactive simulations, several solutions of the dilution zone are designed to improve the uniformity of radial and circumferential temperature at the turbine inlet.

40|$|Introduction and Summary Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} and, at the same time, most difficult Problem {{in the design and}} development of gas turbine combustion chambers, is that of achieving a satisfactory and consistent distribution of temperature in the efflux gases discharging into the turbine. In the past, experience has {{played a major role in}} the determination of dilution-zone geometry, and trial and error methods have of necessity been employed in developing the temperature-traverse quality of individual combustor designs to a satisfactory standard. Experimental investigations into dilution-zone performance carried out on actual chambers have led to useful empirical-design data, but very often it has proved difficult or impossible to distinguish the separate influences of all the variables involved. Thus although it is now generally accepted that a satisfactory temperature profile is dependent upon adequate penetration of the dilution jets, coupled with the correct number of jets to form sufficient localized mixing regions, the manner in which the total dilution-hole area is Utilized in terms of number and size of holes is still largely a matter of experience. Unfortunately, more basic studies of jet mixing do not usually yield results that can readily be expressed in the parameters which are most familiar to those concerned with combustion-chamber design. However, some of these investigations can provide a useful guide to the relationships involved. One such investigation resulted in the accumulation of a large amount of data on the mixing of cold jets when injected into hot streams under conditions where the temperature and velocity of the hot and cold streams, the injection-hole diameter, the angle of injection, and the mixing length could be accurately controlled and varied over a wide range. These data are used here, firstly to demonstrate a logical method of dilution zone design and, secondly, to provide quantitative data on the rate of exchange between temperature traverse quality and the relevant design parameters such as dilution zone length, <b>dilution</b> <b>hole</b> diameter and pressure loss factor. The effects of chamber inlet velocity and inlet velocity profile are also examined. Finally, it is proposed that the aerodynamic performance and stability of a combustion chamber may, for most practical purposes, be adequately described in terms of a parameter p which is the ratio of the flametube pressure loss to the overall pressure loss.

Jets in {{crossflow}} {{are of a}} {{high interest}} since they are central {{to a variety of}} indus-trial applications like fuel injectors, smokestacks, cooling of turbine blades and <b>dilution</b> <b>holes</b> in gas turbine combustors. The present work aims at performing an extensive exploration of the field generated by double tandem jets interacting with an oncoming crossflow. The jets are inclined (60 °) and variably but similarly elevated as discharged from nozzles whose height varied between 0 and 5 cm. The jet nozzles discharge a characteristic industrial fume under a temperature gradient of 100 K with reference to the surrounding atmosphere temperature. Consideration is given to a steady, three-dimensional, incompressible and turbulent flow.

Variable combustor geometry was employed to demonstrate its ability to control primary and secondary zone equivalence ratios and overall pressure drop. Both concepts proved to be highly successful in achieving their desired objectives. The steam cooling reduced peak liner temperatures to less than 800 K. This low temperature offers the potential of both long life and reduced use of strategic materials for liner fabrication. These degrees of variable geometry were successfully employed to control air flow distribution within the combustor.

However, because {{they rely on}} the inviscid Euler equations at zero Mach number, they cannot properly describe the regions where aerodynamics may interact with acoustic waves, {{in the vicinity of}} <b>dilution</b> <b>holes</b> and injectors, for example. A methodology is presented to incorporate the effect of non-purely acoustic mechanisms into a three- dimensional thermoacoustic Helmholtz solver. The zones where these mechanisms are important are modeled as two-port acoustic elements, and the corresponding matrices, which notably contain the dissipative effects due to acoustic–hydrodynamic interactions, are used as internal boundary conditions in the Helmholtz solver. The rest of the flow domain, where dissipation is negligible, is solved by the classical Helmholtz equation. With this method, the changes in eigenfrequency and eigenmode structure introduced by the acoustic–hydrodynamic effects are captured, while keeping the simplicity and efficiency of the Helmholtz solver. The methodology is successfully applied on an academic configuration, first with a simple diaphragm, then with an industrial swirler, with matrices measured from experiments and large-eddy simulation...|$|R
40|$|Cooling {{combustor}} chambers for {{gas turbine}} engines is challenging, given the complex flow and thermal fields inherent to these modules. This complexity, in part, {{arises from the}} interaction of high-momentum dilution jets required to mix the fuel with film cooling jets that are intended to cool the combustor walls. This paper discusses the experimental results from a combustor simulator tested in a low-speed wind tunnel that includes both the dilution jets and film-cooling jets. The specific {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the influence that the dilution jets has on the film-cooling effectiveness. Infrared thermography was used to measure surface temperatures along a low thermal conductivity plate to quantify the adiabatic effectiveness from an array of film cooling holes with the presence of <b>dilution</b> <b>holes.</b> To further understand the flow phenomena, thermocouple probes and laser Doppler velocimetry were used to measure the thermal and flow fields, respectively. Parametric experiments indicate that the film cooling flow is disrupted along the combustor walls in the vicinity of the high-momentum dilution jets.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to study the {{internal}} flow effect of varying the inlet velocities inside a combustor. The flow field inside the combustor is controlled by the liner shape and size, wall side holes shape, size and arrangement (primary, secondary and <b>dilution</b> <b>holes),</b> and primary air swirler configuration. Air swirler adds sufficient swirling to the inlet flow to generate central recirculation region (CRZ) which is necessary for flame stability and fuel air mixing enhancement. Therefore, designing an appropriate air swirler is a challenge to produce stable, efficient and low emission combustion with low pressure losses. Four various injection velocities from 30 m/s to 60 m/s with radial vanes angle of 50 degree were used in this analysis to show velocity effect on the internal flow field. The flow behavior was investigated numerically using CFD solver Ansys 14. 0. This study has provided the characteristic insight into the flow pattern inside the combustion chamber.

JICF configurations are typically used where rapid mixing is desirable; classical applications are fuel injection nozzles and <b>dilution</b> <b>holes</b> in gas turbine combustors. Due to the computational cost of DNS, approximate solution methods such as large-eddy simulation (LES) are essential to parametrically study the effect of changing fuel jet configurations on the far field, but these methods require submodels capable of accurately capturing the near-field flame stabilization for success. By incorporating a wealth of turbulence chemistry interactions (between the flame and vorticity generated by the jet shear layer instability as well as product recirculation by a large counter-rotating vortex pair), this DNS is exceptionally well suited to exploration of unclosed terms in LES formulations such as the chemical source-term. One quantity of direct relevance to several models for stratified combustion, such as the Bray-Moss (BM) model and doubly-conditional source-term estimation (DCSE), is the filtered density function for the mixture fraction ! and partially premixed progress variable c.

To determine the effects of combustor exit conditions on the secondary flowfields that develop in the passage of a nozzle guide vane, a progression of computations is presented in which increas-ingly more complicated effects were modeled.

Electrically heated aluminum strips placed symmetrically about the leading edge stagnation region were used to measure spanwise-averaged heat transfer coefficients. The maximum Reynolds number obtained, based on leading edge diameter, was about 100, 000. The model was immersed in the flow field downstream of an approximately half-scale model of a can-type combustor from a low NO(x), ground-based power-generating turbine.

40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} have motivated turbine engine manufacturers {{to create new}} combustor designs with reduced fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. These designs are however more sensitive to a mechanism known as combustion instabilities, a coupling between flame and acoustics that can generate dangerous levels of heat release and pressure fluctuations. Combustion instabilities can be predicted at an attractive cost by Helmholtz solvers. These solvers describe the acoustic behavior of an inviscid fluid at rest with a thermoacoustic Helmholtz equation, that can be solved in the frequency domain as an eigenvalue problem. The flame/acoustics coupling is modeled, often with a first order transfer function relating heat release fluctuations to the acoustic velocity at a reference point. One limitation of Helmholtz solvers is that they cannot account for the interaction between acoustics and vorticity at sharp edges. Indeed, this interaction relies on viscous processes {{at the tip of}} the edge and is suspected to play a strong damping role in a combustor. Neglecting it results in overly pessimistic stability predictions but can also affect the spatial structure of the unstable modes. In this thesis, a methodology was developed to include the effect of complex flow-acoustic interactions into a Helmholtz solver. It takes advantage of the compactness of these interactions and models them as 2 -port matrices, introduced in the Helmholtz solver as a pair of coupled boundary conditions: the Matrix Boundary Conditions. This methodology correctly predicts the frequencies and mode shapes of a nonreactive academic configuration with either an orifice or a swirler, two elements where flowacoustic interactions are important. For industrial combustors, the matrix methodology must be extended for two reasons. First, industrial geometries are complex, and the Matrix Boundary Conditions must be applied to non-plane surfaces. This limitation is overcome thanks to an adjustment procedure. The matrix data on non-plane surfaces is obtained from the well-defined data on plane surfaces, by applying non-dissipative transformations determined either analytically or from an acoustics propagation solver. Second, the reference point of the flame/acoustics model is often chosen inside the injector and a new reference location must be defined if the injector is removed and replaced by its equivalent matrix. In this work, the reference point is replaced by a reference surface, chosen as the upstream matrix surface of the injector. The extended matrix methodology is successfully validated on academic configurations. It is then applied to study the stability of an annular combustor from Safran. Compared to standard Helmholtz computations, it is found that complex flow-acoustic features at <b>dilution</b> <b>holes</b> and injectors play an important role on the combustor stability and mode shapes.

It is often not possible to measure temperature of all surfaces of interest in real-time. Off-line temperature measurement techniques {{can be used to}} record exposure temperatures {{in such a way that}} these can be retrieved later off-line, at room temperature. Thermal paint changes colour or surface properties permanently, depending on the maximum temperature they have been exposed to. Thermal paints have been a valuable tool of engine developers for many years, but the use of the existing paints presents a number of challenges if reliable results are to be obtained. Feist et al. [1] proposed a thermal history sensor based on phosphors that undergo permanent changes in their luminescence properties when exposed to high temperatures. These luminescence properties can be interrogated with a light source and measured with standard spectroscopic instrumentation. Phosphorescent thermal history sensors might be applied as paint, coating or as point-sensors. The proposed concept has several advantages over the existing sensors. As the main embodiment is a paint or coating, the proposed sensor would be a direct competing technology to thermal paints. The present study reports on the three main concepts responsible for the permanent changes in some phosphors that have been identified. The mechanisms behind these concepts are outlined and examples are given of phosphors which could be used as sensors. The amorphous-to-crystalline and the thermal damaging concepts were demonstrated in laboratory tests in this work. An extensive characterisation of the luminescence properties dependency on thermal history was conducted on several phosphors: BAM : Eu, BAM : Eu;Mn, Y 2 O 2 S : Eu, SrAl 2 O 4 : Eu, Y 2 SiO 5 : Tb, Y AG : Dy and Y SZ=Y AG : Dy. Calibration curves of powder, paint and/or coating embodiments of these phosphors are presented. The amorphous-to-crystalline concept revealed to be the most promising for the application as thermal history sensor, covering a temperature range from 300 °C to 1300 °C. The amorphous-to-crystalline phosphor Y 2 SiO 5 : Tb was synthesised by sol-gel technique and applied as a paint on a stainless steel disk, which was subsequently exposed to a jet impinging flame. A luminescence readout of the paint after the exposure to the flame revealed a map of temperatures between 300 °C and 800 °C. The paint was able to highlight the asymmetrical set-up of the impinging flame. The phosphor Y SZ=Y AG : Dy was APS-coated on a rotating turbine blade and inner flame tube of a Rolls-Royce Viper 201 jet engine, which was operated for several hours. Temperature profile maps were obtained after interrogation of the luminescence changes of the coating.

40|$|For gas turbines, {{the demand}} for high-performance, more {{efficient}} and longer-life turbine blades is increasing. This is especially so, now {{that there is a}} need for high-power and low-weight aircraft gas turbines. Thus, the search for improved design methodologies for the optimisation of combustor exit temperature profiles enjoys high priority. Traditional experimental methods are found to be too time-consuming and costly, and they do not always achieve near-optimal designs. In addition to the above deficiencies, methods based on semi-empirical correlations are found to be lacking in performing three-dimensional analyses and these methods cannot be used for parametric design optimisation. Computational fluid dynamics has established itself as a viable alternative to reduce the amount of experimentation needed, resulting in a reduction in the time scales and costs of the design process. Furthermore, computational fluid dynamics provides more insight into the flow process, which is not available through experimentation only. However, the fact remains that, because of the trial-and-error nature of adjusting the parameters of the traditional optimisation techniques used in this field, the designs reached cannot be called “optimum”. The trial-and-error process depends a great deal on the skill and experience of the designer. Also, the above technologies inhibit the improvement of the gas turbine power output by limiting the highest exit temperature possible, putting more pressure on turbine blade cooling technologies. This limitation to technology can be overcome by implementing a search algorithm capable of finding optimal design parameters. Such an algorithm will perform an optimum search prior to computational fluid dynamics analysis and rig testing. In this thesis, an efficient methodology is proposed for the design optimisation of a gas turbine combustor exit temperature profile. The methodology involves the combination of computational fluid dynamics with a gradient-based mathematical optimiser, using successive objective and constraint function approximations (Dynamic-Q) to obtain the optimum design. The methodology is tested on three cases, namely: (a) The first case involves the optimisation of the combustor exit temperature profile with two design variables related to the <b>dilution</b> <b>holes,</b> which is a common procedure. The combustor exit temperature profile was optimised, and the pattern factor improved, but pressure drop was very high. (b) The second case involves the optimisation of the combustor exit temperature profile with four design variables, one equality constraint and one inequality constraint based on pressure loss. The combustor exit temperature profile was also optimised within the constraints of pressure. Both the combustor exit temperature profile and pattern factor were improved. (c) The third case involves the optimisation of the combustor exit temperature profile with five design variables. The swirler angle and primary hole parameters were included in order to allow for the effect of the central toroidal recirculation zone on the combustor exit temperature profile. Pressure loss was also constrained to a certain maximum. The three cases show that a relatively recent mathematical optimiser (Dynamic-Q), combined with computational fluid dynamics, can be considered a strong alternative to the design optimisation of a gas turbine combustor exit temperature profile. This is due to the fact that the proposed methodology provides designs that can be called near-optimal, when compared with that yielded by traditional methods and computational fluid dynamics alone.

40|$|In this study, {{experimental}} {{data was collected}} {{in order to create}} a test case that can be used to validate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and the individual models used therein for gas turbine combustor applications. In many cases, the CFD results of gas turbine combustors do not correlate well with experimental results. For this reason, there is a requirement to test the simulation method used before CFD can successfully be used for combustor design. This test case encompasses all the features of a gas turbine combustor such as a swirler, primary, secondary and <b>dilution</b> <b>holes</b> as well as cooling rings. Experiments were performed on the same combustor geometry for both non-reacting and reacting flows. The non-reacting flow experiments consisted of stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements performed at various planes in the three zones of the combustor. Data was collected on planes, both in line with the holes and in between the holes of each zone. For the reacting experiments, the temperatures on the outlet plane were measured using a thermocouple rake, thus a temperature contour plot on the outlet plane was produced. Further, the combustor can was modified with passive inserts, which were tested to determine their influence on the outlet temperature distribution during reacting runs. In this set-up, the outlet velocity profiles were also measured using a Pitot tube during both non-reacting and reacting flows. In addition to the outlet temperature distribution and velocity profiles, images of the flame patterns were captured, which showed the positions of flame tongues, fluctuating flames and steady flames. Carbon burn patterns on the walls of the combustor liner were also captured. From the data collected during the reacting runs, the pattern factor, profile factor, overall pressure loss and pressure loss factor were calculated. The non-reacting experiments performed using the PIV, produced three-dimensional velocity vector fields throughout the combustor. These experiments were performed at various flow rates, which gave an indication of which features of the combustor flow were affected by the flow rate. When comparing the individual PIV images alongside one another, the temporal nature of the combustor flow was also evident. The reacting experiments revealed a hot region of exhaust gas around the outer edge of the exhaust while there was a cooler region in the centre of the outlet flow. The PIV flowfield results revealed the reason for then hot outer ring-like region was due to the path the hot gasses would take. The hot combustor gas from the primary zone diverges outwards in the secondary zone then is further forced to the outside by the dilution recirculation zone. The hot flow then leaves the combustor along the wall while the cooler air from the jets leaves the combustor in the centre. The experiments performed produced a large variety of data that can be used to validate a number of aspects of combustor simulation using CFD. The non-reacting {{experimental data}} can be used to validate the turbulence models used and to evaluate how well the flow features were modelled or captured during the non-reacting stage of the combustor simulation process. The typical flow features such as jet penetration depths and the position and size of the recirculation regions are provided for effective comparison. The thermal results presented on the outlet plane of the combustor can be used for comparison with CFD results once combustion is modelled.
