25|$|Another ancient {{method of}} holding the work is the hold fast or <b>holdfast.</b> A <b>holdfast</b> looks like a shepherd's crook. The shank goes into {{a hole in the}} bench top and the tip of the hook is pressed against the work from above. The <b>holdfast</b> is set by rapping the top with a mallet, and {{released}} by hitting the back side. A good <b>holdfast</b> works remarkably well, and is inexpensive and easy to install.|$|E
25|$|The <b>holdfast</b> {{can also}} be used for {{clamping}} work {{to the side of the}} bench for jointing. If the legs on your base are not too far under the top, simply bore a hole in the side of the leg and use the <b>holdfast</b> horizontally. A woodworker can do just about anything he needs on a bench with only a planing stop and a <b>holdfast</b> or two.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Holdfast</b> Shores development, {{starting}} in the late 1990s, included {{the construction of the}} Marina Pier apartment building with its own private marina in Glenelg North, and the Pier Hotel. The development was met with strong opposition, from both local residents and the City of <b>Holdfast</b> Bay, fearing overdevelopment would ruin the area. Parts of the plan were scaled back, with the Platinum Apartment building scaled down from fifteen stories to nine, and the cinema complex cancelled.|$|E
25|$|The rocky {{shores of}} Heard Island exhibit a clear {{demarcation}} between fauna {{of the lower}} kelp <b>holdfast</b> zone and the upper shore zone community, probably due to effects of desiccation, predation and freezing in the higher areas. The limpet Nacella kerguelensis is abundant in {{the lower part of}} the shore, being found on rock surfaces and on kelp holdfasts. Other common but less abundant species in this habitat include the chiton Hemiarthrum setulosum and the starfish Anasterias mawsoni. The amphipod Hyale sp. and the isopod Cassidinopsis sp. are closely associated with the kelp. Above the kelp <b>holdfast</b> zone, the littornid Laevilitorina (Corneolitorina) heardensis and the bivalve mollusc Kidderia bicolor are found in well-sheltered situations, and another bivalve Gaimardia trapesina trapesina has been recorded from immediately above the <b>holdfast</b> zone. Oligochaetes are also abundant in areas supporting porous and spongy layers of algal mat.|$|E

Construction of the Glenelg Institute, which is now the Glenelg Town Hall (pictured top right), started in 1875. The institute opened in 1877, with lecture rooms, a concert hall and a library. The classical structure was designed by Edmund Wright, whose works include the Adelaide Town Hall and Adelaide General Post Office on King William Street.

40|$|International audienceKelp <b>holdfasts</b> {{are highly}} {{reticulated}} structures which host a large diversity of small fauna. These microhabitats {{have been reported}} to {{play a crucial role in}} the biodiversity associated to kelp forest ecosystems. This study aimed at identifying trophic links and the main food sources sustaining food webs within communities associated with kelp <b>holdfasts,</b> through a stable isotope (d 13 C and d 15 N) approach. Sampling of the main invertebrates inhabiting Laminaria digitata <b>holdfasts,</b> and of their potential food sources, took place in February and May 2007. Stable isotope results reveal that most of the primary consumers, including filter-feeders and deposit-feeders, rely on the particulate organic matter sedimented within kelp <b>holdfasts.</b> Only three grazers departed from this general pattern. The correspondence between the stable isotope ratios of predators and sediment consumers indicated that this source is at the base of the main pathway through which energy and matter transit in the food web. d 15 N ranges found for consumers revealed that the food web associated with kelp <b>holdfasts</b> is composed of 3. 5 levels. In spite of the low diversity of food sources at the base of the food web, these microhabitats can therefore be considered micro-scale ecosystems, from a functional perspective...|$|R

25|$|Multiple kelp species often co-exist {{within a}} forest; the term {{understory}} canopy {{refers to the}} stipitate and prostrate kelps. For example, a Macrocystis canopy may extend many meters above the seafloor towards the ocean surface, while an understory of the kelps Eisenia and Pterygophora reaches upward only a few meters. Beneath these kelps, a benthic assemblage of foliose red algae may occur. The dense vertical infrastructure with overlying canopy forms a system of microenvironments similar to those observed in a terrestrial forest, with a sunny canopy region, a partially shaded middle, and darkened seafloor. Each guild has associated organisms, which vary in their levels of dependence on the habitat, and the assemblage of these organisms can vary with kelp morphologies. For example, in California, Macrocystis pyrifera forests, the nudibranch Melibe leonina, and skeleton shrimp Caprella californica are closely associated with surface canopies; the kelp perch Brachyistius frenatus, rockfish Sebastes spp., and many other fishes are found within the stipitate understory; brittle stars and turban snails Tegula spp. are {{closely associated with the}} kelp <b>holdfast,</b> while various herbivores, such as sea urchins and abalone, live under the prostrate canopy; many seastars, hydroids, and benthic fishes live among the benthic assemblages; solitary corals, various gastropods, and echinoderms live over the encrusting coralline algae. In addition, pelagic fishes and marine mammals are loosely associated with kelp forests, usually interacting near the edges as they visit to feed on resident organisms.|$|E
500|$|Postelsia has two {{distinct}} morphologies: one for its diploid, monoicous sporophyte stage, {{which is the}} dominant portion of the life cycle, and one for its smaller, haploid, dioecious gametophyte stage. [...] Like all seaweeds, the sporophyte stage of Postelsia consists of a thallus, which {{is made up of}} a stem-like stipe topped with possibly over 100 leaf-like blades, and rests on a root-like <b>holdfast.</b> [...] The <b>holdfast</b> anchors the organism to the rocks it lives on. [...] The sea palm has no vascular system; the stipe is only for support of the organism and holds the fronds up over other organisms so they can receive more light. [...] The stipe is merely a firm, hollow tube, able to withstand the open air of low tide conditions as well as the crashing waves of high tide. [...] The blades are grooved, with the sporangia held within these grooves. [...] The gametophyte stage is microscopic, consisting of only a few cells. [...] The gametophytes produce sperm and eggs to create new sporophytes.|$|E
500|$|When Italian {{botanist}} Achille Forti (1878–1937) {{worked on}} the specimens in 1926, they were reinterpreted as close relatives of Postelsia, now {{known to be a}} brown algae, which had lived in the coastal waters of the Eocene sea. Forti renamed the species Postelsiopsis caput-medusae commemorating the fossils' extreme similarity to the extant Postelsia palmaeformis. [...] The appearance of the plant fossil is a <b>holdfast</b> on the bottom, with a stem-like stipe between there and the fronds which are about [...] to [...] In life, the fronds would have hung vertically whenever the plant was submerged during high tide, and would have flopped over the stipe when the plant was exposed during low tide in a habitus {{similar to that of the}} living sea palm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{potential}} {{benefits associated with}} coalescence in red algae have been best documented with early stages of development. In this study, {{we report on the}} effects of the original number of spores on branching and fertility during later stages of development. Measurements for 20 months of survival rates, field growth, and fertility of a set of 96 sporelings produced in the laboratory with different number of spores, and outplanted at mid levels of the Mazzaella laminarioides belt at a locality in central Chile, indicate significant differences between multisporic <b>holdfasts</b> (50 and 100 coalescing spores) and uni- or oligosporic (ten spore) <b>holdfasts</b> in the number of branches and erect axes produced 10 and 15 months after germination. The difference is related to the persistence of clusters of axes and branch initials in deep portions of <b>holdfasts</b> of multisporic plantlets and their absence from equivalent portions of uni- or oligosporic <b>holdfasts.</b> This is an example in macroalgae of an event occurring during germination and expressing its effects in the next growing season (some 10 months after) ...|$|R

[...] He was embarrassed that the LCL {{was in a position}} to win government despite having clearly lost the first-preference vote, and was committed to a fairer electoral system. [...] The reforms were significant, but did not go as far as the change to [...] "one vote one value" [...] that Labor and Dunstan had demanded. The lower house formerly had 39 seats—13 in Adelaide and 26 in the country. Now, 47 seats were to be contested: 28 in Adelaide and 19 in the country. [...] While there was still a slight rural weighting (since Adelaide accounted for two-thirds of the state's population), with Adelaide now electing a majority of the legislature, historical results made a Labor win at the next election likely. [...] Under the Playmander, Labor usually dominated Adelaide. [...] In most years, the LCL won almost no seats in the capital outside of the wealthy eastern crescent and around <b>Holdfast</b> Bay. [...] Under the circumstances, conventional wisdom was that Hall undertook electoral reform knowing he was effectively handing the premiership to Dunstan at the next election.|$|E

500|$|Even {{while the}} {{economic}} boom continued, the LCL vote gradually declined after 1941. [...] The LCL never held more than 23 seats during Playford's tenure due to being almost nonexistent in Adelaide. [...] With few exceptions, its support in the capital {{was limited to the}} eastern crescent and the <b>Holdfast</b> Bay area even at the height of Playford's power. [...] It relied on favourable preferences from minor parties and independents and the malapportioned electoral system in order to stay in office. It did, however, win a majority of actual votes, barring 1944 and 1953, on a two-party-preferred basis until 1962. Labor had begun to combat the Playmander by directing its efforts at individual seats, and abandoning a statewide campaign. Slowly, seats were whittled away—the loss of Norwood in 1953 was followed by the losses of Murray, Millicent and Frome in 1956, and Mt Gambier and Wallaroo in 1957–8 by-elections. Playford's dominance over the party and his ignorance of the wishes of its broad membership base brought about a degree of disillusionment, and the party machine began to decay. The dominance stopped {{the emergence of a new}} generation of political talent, and had a [...] "stultifying" [...] effect. Although the Playmander ensured his ongoing electoral success, and Playford was credited with South Australia's economic success, the LCL polled a lower percentage than the corresponding Liberal government at federal level.|$|E
