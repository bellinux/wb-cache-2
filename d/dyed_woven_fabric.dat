In this study, the colour changes on 100 % cotton <b>dyed</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> after softening and shrinkage treatments are investigated.

The behaviour of reactive <b>dyes</b> on Tencel <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> varies with the type and the density of <b>woven</b> <b>fabric.</b> The highly crystalline Tencel fibre is less easy to dye uniformly by the continuous dyeing methods because of the short time of contact between the dye and fibre. The purpose of this work is to investigate the influences of <b>weave</b> structure on <b>dyeing</b> of standard Tencel fabric using reactive dyes applied by continuous dyeing methods. Programmes are developed using Matlab software to measure the fabric porosity and uniformity of fibre coloration (UFC) in the yarns of the <b>woven</b> <b>fabric.</b> UFC is also measured subjectively. Firstly, fabrics of four different weave structures (plain, 2 / 1, 3 / 1, 5 / 1 twill fabric) are studied. The visual depth and UFC standard deviation values is highest for the 2 / 1 twill fabric, gradually reducing towards the 5 / 1 twill fabric. Secondly, nine plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabrics</b> of different fabric densities are dyed using different padding procedures - a liquor temperature of 40 ⁰C with a 1 min dwell time and with a 5 min dwell time, and liquor at room temperature without any dwell time. The padded fabrics are then fixed by pad-steam, pad-dry-steam, pad-batch and pad-dry-thermosol continuous dyeing processes. To improve colour depth the plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabrics</b> are given a caustic pre-treatment and their dyeing characteristics are compared with untreated fabrics.
