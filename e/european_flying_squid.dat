40|$|Comunicación presentada en el European Mycoplasma Meeting: Mycoplasmas - A Practical Approach, celebrado los días 6 y 7 de junio de 2013 en Dubrovnik (Croacia) Mollicutes {{have been}} found in nearly all living beings on the planet. Mycoplasma species have been {{reported}} in marine mammals (cetaceans and pinnipeds) and fish. Among marine invertebrates, Mollicutes have been identified in bryozoans, American oysters, corals and a variety of marine crustacean species like crayfish and shrimps. This work describes the methodology and the attempts to isolate mollicutes from non-mammal marine animals. One hundred and seven fish of twenty one different species, seven octopus (Octopus vulgaris), two <b>European</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squids</b> (Todarodes sagittatus) and four batches of jellyfish (Pelagia nocticula) were tested for the presence of mollicutes. Samples were cultured using a variation of the SP 4 -II medium. Originally the SP 4 -II medium was supplemented with 1. 5 % of NaCl and incubated at 18 ºC anaerobically. However, after the first isolation was obtained, the growth conditions were adjusted to 3 % of NaCl and aerobically incubation at 25 ºC. DNA was extracted after one month of incubation and a Class Mollicutes real time PCR has been done. Mollicutes isolations were obtained from squid in three samples; two from octopus and four from jellyfish. It was not possible to get isolations from fish, although two samples gave positive to the class PCR. Isolates were analyzed biochemically and genetically (16 S- 23 S Intergenic Spacer Region (ISR) and 16 S rDNA). PCR products were sent for sequencing. Nucleotide sequences were compared using the GeneBank software. A partial 16 S rDNA sequence from a jellyfish isolation was classified as Spiroplasma spp. 16 S rDNA and ISR from squids and octopus isolations differs significantly from all known Mycoplasma species, but have 98 - 99 % of similarity with a partial 16 S rDNA sequence (738 bp; AY 226323) detected in environmental samples (brine water, Mediterranean Sea) Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Isotopic mixingmodels were applied to obtain a quantitative estimate of the proportion of themain prey species in the diet of pilot whales. Stable isotope analysis revealed that 57. 8 – 73. 8 % of the diet in Northwest Iberia consisted in curled octopus (Eledone cirrhosa), followed by <b>European</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squid</b> (Todarodes sagittatus), while in Scotland the predominant prey specieswas either Histioteuthis sp. or T. sagittatus, depending of the trophic enrichment factor applied.

The OCP concentrations were below the maximum residue limits established for fish and aquatic products by the Decreto Ministerale 13 May 2005 in all the samples analyzed; therefore the OCPs in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea species {{are unlikely to be}} a significant health hazard. Conversely, the mean concentrations of PCBs exceeded (greatly in some cases) the current limits (200 ng(- 1) fat weight) set by the European Union for terrestrial foods.

Species were selected due to their habitat, trophic level, feeding behaviour and their use in the Italian diet. Mussels, filter feeder and sedentary organisms, were used {{in order to test}} water pollution whereas Norway lobster and red mullet (benthic fish) were used in order to test sediment pollution. The concentration of ?PCBs exceeded that of ?OCs in the samples analysed. The highest concentrations of ?PCBs (1415 ng/g lipid weight) and ?OCs (507 ng/g lipid weight) were found in pilchard while the lowest concentrations of the same pollutants were found in cephalopods. Our results have shown that species such as anchovy, pilchard and mackerel, were the most polluted due to their location at the last level of the trophic chain. All samples contained different concentrations of PCBs and among these, congeners 153 and 138 were the most representative. Among the OCs, except for the cuttle-fish, the highest concentrations were found for p,p(') -DDE and p,p(') -DDD that are metabolite of DDT. The prevailing DDE presence, compared to DDT (high DDE/DDT ratio), suggested that the biotransformation rate of pollutants was very efficacious in fish and above all in crustaceans. Results have also been interpreted in terms of geographical distribution and organisms' biological cycle.
