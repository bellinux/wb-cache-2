40|$|The {{report on}} the role of smart ICT in the design and {{planning}} of infrastructure had its genesis in the 2014 inquiry by the <b>House</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> and Communications Committee into infrastructure planning and procurement. During that inquiry, the Infrastructure and Communications Committee received evidence outlining exciting new developments in the application of smart ICT to infrastructure. This evidence, particularly from BCE Surveying and Autodesk, revealed a new way of designing, planning, building and managing infrastructure. The Committee determined to explore this further and the smart ICT inquiry was born. The inquiry began under the <b>House</b> <b>Infrastructure</b> and Communications Committee, led by its Chair, Mrs Jane Prentice. In October 2015 that committee was disbanded and two new committees were formed. This inquiry was adopted and completed by the <b>House</b> <b>Infrastructure,</b> Transport and Cities Committee. It is testament to the importance attached to this inquiry that former committee members, and particularly the former Chair, have maintained a close interest in its progress and outcome. The inquiry ended up being more comprehensive and time-consuming than originally anticipated. The more evidence that was received about the role of smart ICT in infrastructure, the more the Committee recognised the possibilities inherent in new technologies and systems. These technologies, if used effectively, have the capacity to transform the design, construction and management of infrastructure assets; the management and use of existing assets; and the operation of transport, communications, energy and utility systems. These technologies are transformational, with the capacity to increase the productivity of the Australian economy. In order to achieve this, however, governments and industry must be aware of the potential of smart ICT, and must invest in the technologies, skills and systems to make the transformation a reality. That is the core of this report. continued via lin...|$|R
