50|$|At first, {{motor drives}} were {{external}} units that {{attached to the}} basic camera body, normally beneath it, with an interface consisting of a physical drive socket and some electrical contacts to signal the drive when to actuate. Beginning in the late 1970s, motor drives began to be integrated into cameras themselves - at first, in compact cameras for the beginner market, and by the 1980s, in amateur-grade and later professional-grade single lens reflex cameras.

50|$|The southwest-northeast {{bisector}} of Arkansas {{has always}} been an <b>integral</b> <b>motor</b> route. Prior to designation as US 67, the route was known as the Southwest Trail, an old military road around 1803. The Southwest Trail connected St. Louis, Missouri with Texas by steamboat in Fulton, Arkansas. The main railroad was built along the Southwest Trail, which developed many towns along the route. President Andrew Jackson appropriated money for the route in 1831, and designated it as a National Road. Although the route shifted slightly, it always has followed the natural break between the Ozark Mountains and the Ouachita Mountains and the Mississippi Alluvial Plain.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the <b>integral</b> <b>motor</b> of tomorrow, and {{particularly}} with a variable speed, sensorless permanent magnet synchronous motor with an integrated converter. The rated power is 15 kW at 1500 r/min. The outer dimensions are approximately {{the same as for}} the equivalent standard induction motor. Control strategies for pumps and fans, i. e. suitable loads for variable speed motors, are briefly described. The huge energy savings that can be made by reducing the speed instead of throttling/choking the flow are pointed out. Compared to installing an induction motor with a separate converter, a PM <b>integral</b> <b>motor</b> will probably pay-off in less than a year. A totally analytical expression for calculating the airgap flux density of permanent magnet motors with buried magnets is derived. The analytical expression includes axial leakage, and iron saturation of the most narrow part of the magnetic circuit of the machine. A computer program for optimization of PM motors with buried magnets has been developed. It was used to design the manufactured prototype PM <b>integral</b> <b>motor,</b> and the parameters are investigated with analytical and/or FEM calculations. The optimization program is also used to suggest nearoptimum pole numbers for desired powers (4 - 37 kW) and speeds (750 - 3000 r/min) of inverter-fed PM motors. Results show that compact buried PM motors should have relatively large airgaps and high NdFeB-magnet masses to improve the efficiency. Ferrite magnets are unsuitable. Measurements on the manufactured PM motor, the novel concept of stator integrated filter coils, and the complete PM <b>integral</b> <b>motor</b> are presented. Special attention was given to temperature and overall efficiency measurements. The rotor cage losses were investigated by time-stepping FEM. Four short circuit fault conditions were also examined in order to evaluate the risks of demagnetization of the buried magnets. NR 2014080...|$|E

We studied in real time the delivery of YFP-prestin to the plasma membrane of cells from a tetracycline-inducible cell line. Following the release of temperature block to reinstate trans Golgi network delivery of the integral membrane protein, we measured nonlinear capacitance (NLC) and membrane fluorescence during voltage clamp. Prestin was delivered exponentially to the plasma membrane with a time constant of less than 10 minutes, with both electrical and fluorescence methods showing high temporal correlation. However, based on disparity between estimates of prestin density derived from either fluorescence or NLC, we conclude that sub-tetrameric forms of prestin contribute to our electrical and fluorescence measures. Thus, in agreement with previous observations we find that functional prestin is not an obligate tetramer...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA common {{feature in}} the {{maturation}} of linear dsDNA viruses is that the lengthy viral genome is translocated with remarkable velocity into a limited space within a preformed protein shell using ATP as motor energy. Most biomotors, such as myosin, kinesin, DNA-helicase, and RNA polymerase, contain one ATP-binding component that acts processively. An examination of the well-studied dsDNA viruses reveals that DNA packaging motors involve two nonstructural components. Which component of the motor is the integrated processive factor to turn the motor has not been identified. In bacterial virus phi 29, these two components consist of a gp 16 protein and an RNA molecule called pRNA. We have previously predicted and recently confirmed that gp 16 binds ATP. It is generally believed that gp 16 serves as an ATP-binding and processive component to drive the motor. In this article, phi 29 DNA-packaging intermediates were purified in quantity and examined to differentiate the role between gp 16 and pRNA. It {{was found that the}} pRNA hexamer is an <b>integral</b> <b>motor</b> component, while gp 16 is not stably bound. Only one pRNA hexamer, but multiple copies of gp 16, were needed to accomplish DNA packaging. pRNA functions continuously during the entire DNA translocation process, suggesting that pRNA is {{a vital part of the}} DNA packaging motor...|$|E

40|$|Microtubule-based {{transport}} {{in cells}} {{is powered by}} a small set of distinct motors, yet timing and destination of transport can be controlled in a cargo-specific manner. The mechanistic basis for this specificity is not understood. To address this question, we analyzed the Drosophila Klarsicht (Klar) protein that regulates distinct microtubule-based transport processes. We find that localization of Klar to its cargoes is crucial for Klar function. Using mutations, we identify functionally important regions of Klar that confer distinct cargo specificity. In ovaries, Klar is present on the nuclear envelope, a localization that requires the C-terminal KASH domain. In early embryos, Klar is attached to lipid droplets, a localization mediated by a novel C-terminal domain encoded by an alternatively spliced exon. In cultured cells, these two domains are sufficient for targeting to the correct intracellular location. Our analysis disentangles Klar's modular organization: we propose that a core region <b>integral</b> to <b>motor</b> regulation is attached to variable domains so that the cell can target regulators with overlapping, yet distinct functions to specific cargoes. Such isoform variation may be a general strategy for adapting a common regulatory mechanism to specifically control motion and positioning of multiple organelles...|$|R
