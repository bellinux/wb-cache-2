40|$|The {{scope of}} this study is to {{identify}} and improve wind speed prediction errors for storms that have impacted the Northeastern United States during 2003 - 2014. Accurate wind speed prediction under storm occurrences is significant to identify and assess impacts to the environment and critical infrastructure. Post-processing of a numerical weather prediction model (Weather Research and Forecasting-WRF) was used in the form of Universal Kriging for spatial interpolation and Kalman Filter for bias reduction. Two strategies for using the Kalman Filter in combination with Universal Kriging are investigated and assessed. Universal Kriging of Kalman <b>Filter</b> <b>corrections</b> reduced all error statistics of the WRF model surface wind speed outputs used in this study. The spatial and seasonal variability of wind speed error reduction are also discussed as well as suggestions for future research directions in this topic...|$|E
40|$|To {{quantify}} small molecule penetration {{into and}} eventually permeation through nanopores, we applied an improved excess-noise {{analysis of the}} ion current fluctuation caused by entering molecules. The kinetic parameters of substrate entry and exit are derived from a two-state Markov model, analyzing the substrate concentration dependence of the average ion current and its variance. Including <b>filter</b> <b>corrections</b> allows one to detect the transition rates beyond the cutoff frequency, fc, of the instrumental ion-current filter. As an application of the method, we performed {{an analysis of the}} single-channel ion current of Meropenem, an antibiotic of the carbapenem family, interacting with OmpF, the major general outer membrane channel of Escherichia coli bacteria. At 40 Â°C we detected the residence time of Meropenem inside OmpF of about 500 ns - more than 2 orders of magnitude smaller than fc- 1 and close to the diffusion limit of few hundred nanoseconds. We also have established theoretical limit conditions under which the substrate-induced channel blockages can be detected and suggest that submicrosecond-scale gating kinetic parameters are accessible with existing experimental equipment...|$|E
40|$|Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data {{assimilation}} {{experiments are}} conducted on a limited-area domain over the Pacific Northwest {{region of the}} United States, using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Idealized surface pressure, radiosoundings, and aircraft observations are assimilated every 6 h for a 7 -day period in January 2004. The objectives here are to study {{the performance of the}} filter in constraining analysis errors with a relatively inhomogeneous, sparse-observation network and to explore the potential for such a network to {{serve as the basis for}} a real-time EnKF system dedicated to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. When only a single observation type is assimilated, results show that the ensemble-mean analysis error and ensemble spread (standard deviation) are significantly reduced com-pared to a control ensemble without assimilation for both observed and unobserved variables. Analysis errors are smaller than background errors over nearly the entire domain when averaged over the 7 -day period. Moreover, comparisons of background errors and observation increments at each assimilation step suggest that the flow-dependent <b>filter</b> <b>corrections</b> are accurate in both scale and amplitude. An illustrative example concerns a misspecified mesoscale 500 -hPa short-wave trough moving along the British Columbia coast, which is corrected by surface pressure observations alone.

The data represent {{one of the best}} sets of optical {{and infrared}} photometry ever obtained for a Type Ia supernova. Based on synthetic photometry using optical spectra of SN 2001 el and optical and infrared spectra of SN 1999 ee, we were able to devise <b>filter</b> <b>corrections</b> for the BVJHK photometry of SN 2001 el which to some extent resolve systematic differences between SN 2001 el datasets obtained with different telescope/filter/instrument combinations. We also calculated V minus infrared color curves {{on the basis of a}} delayed detonation model and showed that the theoretical color curves match the unreddened loci for Type Ia SNe with mid-range decline rates to within 0. 2 mag. Given the completeness of the light curves and the elimination of filter-oriented systematic errors to some degree, the data presented here will be useful for the construction of photometric templates, especially in the infrared. On the whole the photometric behavior of SN 2001 el was quite normal. The second H-band maximum being brighter than the first H-band maximum is in accord with the prediction of Krisciunas et al. (2000) for Type Ia SNe with mid-range decline rates. The photometry exhibits non-zero host extinction, with total A_V = 0. 57 +/- 0. 05 mag along the line of sight.

40|$|A dual {{wavelength}} {{method was}} developed for the field detection of optical brighteners (OBs), fluorescent laundry additives used as indicators of anthropogenic wastes. The method was quantitative for OBs under variable levels of fluorescent colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Based on excitation at 300 - 400 nm and 440 and 550 nm emission, the method assumed a constant ratio of fluorescence due to CDOM alone, even if absolute amplitude varied. Concentrations of OBs were computed as {{the difference between the}} observed 440 nm emission and the expected CDOM fluorescence at 440 nm, as extrapolated from the 550 nm fluorescence and established CDOM fluorescence ratio. Real-time inner <b>filter</b> <b>corrections</b> were based on absorption modeled from 550 nm fluorescence and from exponential relationships at alternate wavelengths. The effects of temperature and dissolved oxygen on CDOM fluorescence and computed OB were quantified but were minimal because effects were comparable between the two fluorescence regions. Assumptions on the locally conservative behavior of CDOM were supported in field surveys of sewered and non-sewered areas. Varying water masses were detected, but OB quantities were detected that did not co-vary with fluorescence alone. Eleven geographic regions of peninsular Florida and sources of OBs were sampled to evaluate the method under a broader range of CDOM and to conduct an extensive detergent spike analysis. Fluorescence data were collected as EEMs and subjected to PARAFAC modeling, isolating eight spectral factors that could sufficiently describe all samples. There were no visible regions of the spectra that were unique to detergents or OBs, but a previously unreported peak in the UV (3 ̆c 230 / 284 ex / em) was tentatively identified as a detergent surfactant and should be pursued as a potential complementary indicator of anthropogenic wastes. Limits on EEM fluorescence measurements were identified: maximum linear range, maximum turbidity, and sensitivity to assumptions. A sub-sampling technique of EEM data approximated the filter fluorometer readings, was used to optimize the dual wavelength method, validated the method with spike recoveries, and presented alternative approaches...|$|E

The Controlled Dilution Approach (CDA) deals with highly absorbing solutions using the Fluorescent Excitation-Emission Matrix of a controlled weak dilution. Along with the nonlinear FEEM of the original solution, these information allow to estimate the linearized FEEM. The method relies on inner filter effects modelization. Beyond its numerical simplicity, the main interest is that CDA only requires fluorescence measurements. The method was validated using a set of known mixtures {{and a set of}} dissolved organic matter samples. In addition we show that the corrected FEEM can be used efficiently for advanced multilinear analysis.

40|$|Consistent pixel {{sizes are}} of {{fundamental}} importance for assessing texture features that relate intensity and spatial information in radiomics studies. To correct {{for the effects}} of variable pixel sizes, we combined image resampling with Butterworth filtering in the frequency domain and tested the correction on computed tomography (CT) scans of lung cancer patients reconstructed 5 times with pixel sizes varying from 0. 59 to 0. 98 mm. One hundred fifty radiomics features were calculated for each preprocessing and field-of-view combination. Intra-patient agreement and inter-patient agreement were compared using the overall concordance correlation coefficient (OCCC). To further evaluate the corrections, hierarchical clustering was used to identify patient scans before and after correction. To assess the general applicability of the corrections, they were applied to 17 CT scans of a radiomics phantom. The reduction in the inter-scanner variability relative to non-small cell lung cancer patient scans was quantified. The variation in pixel sizes caused the intra-patient variability to be large (OCCC < 95 %) relative to the inter-patient variability in 79 % of the features. However, with the resampling and <b>filtering</b> <b>corrections,</b> the intra-patient variability was relatively large in only 10 % of the features. With the <b>filtering</b> <b>correction,</b> 8 of 8 patients were correctly clustered, in contrast to only 2 of 8 without the correction. In the phantom study, resampling and filtering the images of a rubber particle cartridge substantially reduced variability in 61 % of the radiomics features and substantially increased variability in only 6 % of the features. Surprisingly, resampling without filtering tended to increase the variability. In conclusion, applying a correction based on resampling and Butterworth low-pass filtering in the frequency domain effectively reduced variability in CT radiomics features caused by variations in pixel size. This correction may also reduce the variability introduced by other CT scan acquisition parameters...|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of groundwater flow and transport model predictions highly depends on {{our knowledge of}} subsurface physical parameters. Assimilation of contaminant concentration data from shallow dug wells could help improving model behavior, eventually resulting in better forecasts. In this paper, we propose a joint state-parameter estimation scheme which efficiently integrates a low-rank extended Kalman filtering technique, namely the Singular Evolutive Extended Kalman (SEEK) filter, with the prominent complex-step method (CSM). The SEEK filter avoids the prohibitive computational burden of the Extended Kalman filter by updating the forecast along the directions of error growth only, called <b>filter</b> <b>correction</b> directions. CSM is used within the SEEK filter to efficiently compute model derivatives {{with respect to the}} state and parameters along the <b>filter</b> <b>correction</b> directions. CSM is derived using complex Taylor expansion and is second order accurate. It is proven to guarantee accurate gradient computations with zero numerical round-off errors, but requires complexifying the numerical code. We perform twin-experiments to test the performance of the CSM-based SEEK for estimating the state and parameters of a subsurface contaminant transport model. We compare the efficiency and the {{accuracy of}} the proposed scheme with two standard finite difference-based SEEK filters {{as well as with the}} ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Assimilation results suggest that the use of the CSM in the context of the SEEK filter may provide up to 80 % more accurate solutions when compared to standard finite difference schemes and is competitive with the EnKF, even providing more accurate results in certain situations. We analyze the results based on two different observation strategies. We also discuss the complexification of the numerical code and show that this could be efficiently implemented in the context of subsurface flow models. © 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
