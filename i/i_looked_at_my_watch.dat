500|$|Brundage married Elizabeth Dunlap, {{daughter}} of a Chicago banker, in 1927, when he was 40. Elizabeth Brundage, three years younger than her husband, was a trained soprano, a talent she exhibited for visitors to the Brundage home. She had {{a strong interest in}} classical music, one which may not have been fully shared by her husband, who said of a performance of Wagner's Die Walküre that it [...] "started at 7o'clock, at 10:00pm <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> and it registered exactly 8o'clock". She died at age 81 in 1971.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It was six o'clock. I {{determined}} to lose no time.|$|E
60|$|He {{lapsed into}} silence. The train rolled on. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> London {{was not far}} off now.|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{face in the}} mirror:I know I'm worth nothing {{without you}} ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> 'and. Yes, it is bleeding, {{where the}} bird 'ave bitten it.|$|R
60|$|I {{had many}} weary hours still to wait through. To while away the time, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> letters. Among {{them was a}} letter from Betteredge.|$|R
60|$|Ah! He, of course, would know. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It {{was twenty}} minutes past nine only.... Still.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> Yes, {{five hours}} had been {{gathered}} {{in by the}} grim scytheman. I went to dinner.|$|E
60|$|Perfectly {{clear it}} was, {{perfectly}} clear, and why hadn't I seen it before?... <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch,</b> {{and it was}} half-past two.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> friend's notes, which, in fact, showed, {{that in one}} or two grossly obvious passages, I {{had left}} {{uncorrected}} such solecisms in grammar.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{professional}} colleague {{with a new}} interest. He was {{the legitimate}} fountainhead {{of the information that}} I was dying to have poured into my mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "One—two—three"—had {{it really}} sounded three! Then it rang on a lower bell—"One—two—three." [...] A passing bell for a man! <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> mother—she {{turned away from}} me.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It wanted {{five minutes}} to twelve, when the premonitory {{symptoms}} of the working of the laudanum first showed themselves to me.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It {{was past}} three o'clock--quite the full swing of {{afternoon}} office {{work in the}} port. He snarled imperiously: [...] "Sit down, Captain." ...|$|E
60|$|Searle {{received}} this broadside gaping. Then turning away {{he went and}} seated himself on a bench {{against the wall and}} rubbed his forehead amazedly. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> and listened for the wheels of our carriage.|$|E
3000|$|... “If I was Syrian, I’d go to Britain, to Britain or Germany. But when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> options, Sweden was {{the easiest}} and most secure way.” (Ayham, Sweden).|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{house with}} a quick flash of hope that faded immediately. The door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening slowly as I approached.|$|R
60|$|It was broad daylight. The {{sun shone}} brilliantly, {{the sky was}} cloudless. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch; it had stopped. Shortly {{afterwards}} I heard the hall clock strike six.|$|R
60|$|When I had {{finished}} giving instructions to Wada for the arranging of my things <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It was early yet, only several minutes after three so I went on deck again {{to witness the}} arrival of the crew.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> to {{find that}} it was now eight o'clock in the morning in this horrible place where there was neither morn, nor noon, nor night, but only an eternal {{brightness}} that came I knew not whence, and never learned.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It was {{a quarter}} past three. The tide {{would begin to}} turn about five, {{but it would be}} at least ten before the rock would be covered. I had, then, little more than six hours to live unless rescued.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{interlocutor}} {{with rising}} curiosity. [...] "It certainly is {{rather like a}} diamond. But, if so, it is a Behemoth of diamonds. Where did you get it?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> mistress. If she had {{directed}} me to knock Mr. James Smith down, big as he was, I {{think at that}} moment I could have done it.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{friend the}} brigadier for an explanation. After running his eye over the {{articles}} in the journals, the latter smiled, and cast a <b>look</b> of commiseration <b>at</b> our colleague.|$|R
6000|$|Lister {{fixed the}} date and added: [...] "It was nearly ten o'clock. The porter had just gone through the car and when he said my berth was ready <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> He went to the next Pullman, and I thought he was getting busy late." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'We {{will lose}} no time' I said reassuringly, as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> 'It is now seven-thirty. We will reckon {{the time from}} now, with {{overtime}} at time and a half. But if I am {{to do anything for}} you I must have some idea of what has happened.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{jumped up}} and ran down to the cave. All were there except Margaret, who came {{immediately}} after me carrying Silvio in her arms. When the cat saw his old enemy he struggled to get down; but Margaret held him fast and soothed him. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It was close to eight.|$|E
6000|$|Everybody laughed now, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> hostess in {{a little}} bewilderment. She murmured, [...] "I suppose the joke is that he had befriended one man {{at the expense of}} six others." ...|$|R
6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>at</b> <b>my</b> love-birds [...] That Sunday afternoon, [...] There was {{in their}} tiny tune A dying fetch like broken words, When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> up <b>at</b> <b>my</b> love-birds [...] That Sunday afternoon.|$|R
60|$|I {{had come}} into a {{condition}} of vast perplexities. For {{the first time in}} <b>my</b> life, <b>at</b> least {{so it seems to me}} now in this retrospect, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> existence as a whole.|$|R
6000|$|... "A little sailing-boat was {{approaching}} the shore. The man steering was hidden from {{me by the}} sail; but the boat was so near that I thought I recognized the flag on the mast. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> Yes! It was Armadale coming over from Santa Lucia at his usual time, to visit us in his usual way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Probably {{close to}} half past one. It was two o'clock when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> at Florence Kingsley's house. Directly after Stewart sent Bonita away {{he took me to}} Miss Kingsley's. So, {{allowing}} for the walk and a few minutes' conversation with her, I can pretty definitely say the shooting took place at about half past one." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It was {{a quarter}} to six. I had yet a good hour for work, and with nothing but my pocket-knife and my hands I began to clear away the space about that hammock. When I left it, it looked {{as it used to}} look when it was my {{pleasure}} to lie there and swing and read and reflect.|$|E
60|$|My bed {{was by the}} window. I {{reached out}} my hand and drew aside {{a corner of the}} curtain. The {{sunlight}} streamed into the room. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> watch: it was ten minutes past five.|$|R
60|$|Out of {{a missionary}} school came marching, two and two, sixteen prim and pious little Christian black girls, Europeanly clothed--dressed, {{to the last}} detail, {{as they would have}} been dressed on a summer Sunday in an English or American village. Those clothes--oh, they were unspeakably ugly! Ugly, barbarous, {{destitute}} of taste, destitute of grace, repulsive as a shroud. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> womenfolk's clothes--just full-grown duplicates of the outrages disguising those poor little abused creatures --and was ashamed to be seen in the street with them. Then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> own clothes, and was ashamed to be seen in the street with myself.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> torn trousers, <b>at</b> {{the blood}} on my skinned and burning hands, and I felt of the bruise on my head, as I said, grimly: [...] "I'll hang to him as long as I can." ...|$|R
