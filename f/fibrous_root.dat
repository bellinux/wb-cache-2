40|$|Zhejiang and Sichuan are {{regarded}} as two genuine producing areas of Ophiopogonis radix in China. To study {{the difference in the}} quality of Ophiopogonis radix from these two places, the contents of three reported bioactive saponins, that is, ophiopogonins B, D, and D′, in tubers and <b>fibrous</b> <b>roots</b> of Ophiopogon japonicus from Cixi city of Zhejiang and Santai county of Sichuan were quantified using HPLC-ELSD method and compared. Ophiopogonin B and ophiopogonin D′ content in tubers of HMD were higher than those in radix of CMD, whereas ophiopogonin D in HMD was about twice lower than that of CMD. Three ophiopogonins were all detected in <b>fibrous</b> <b>roots</b> of both HMD and CMD. Their averaged content in <b>fibrous</b> <b>roots</b> of CMD was about twice higher than that in tubers of CMD. Ophiopogonin D in <b>fibrous</b> <b>roots</b> of CMD was about five times higher than that of HMD. Our biochemical assay revealed that <b>fibrous</b> <b>roots</b> and tubers of CMD can be of an important saponin source, especially for ophiopogonin D...|$|R

2500|$|Grasslands {{contribute}} to soil organic matter, stored mainly in their extensive <b>fibrous</b> <b>root</b> mats. Due {{in part to}} the climatic conditions of these regions (e.g. cooler temperatures and semi-arid to arid conditions), these soils can accumulate significant quantities of organic matter. This can vary based on rainfall, the length of the winter season, and the frequency of naturally occurring lightning-induced grass-fires. [...] While these fires release carbon dioxide, they improve the quality of the grasslands overall, in turn increasing the amount of carbon retained in the humic material. [...] They also deposit carbon directly to the soil in the form of char that does not significantly degrade back to carbon dioxide.|$|E

40|$|Rehmannia is a {{medicinal}} plant in China. Autotoxicity {{has been reported}} {{to be one of the}} major problems hindering the consecutive monoculture of Rehmannia. However, potential autotoxins produced by the <b>fibrous</b> <b>roots</b> are less known. In this study, the autotoxicity of these <b>fibrous</b> <b>roots</b> was investigated. Four groups of autotoxic compounds from the aqueous extracts of the <b>fibrous</b> <b>roots</b> were isolated and characterized. The ethyl acetate extracts of these water-soluble compounds were further analyzed and separated into five fractions. Among them, the most autotoxic fraction (Fr 3) was subjected to GC/MS analysis, resulting in 32 identified compounds. Based on literature, nine compounds were selected for testing their autotoxic effects on radicle growth. Seven out of the nine compounds were phenolic, which significantly reduced radicle growth in a concentration-dependent manner. The other two were aliphatic compounds that showed a moderate inhibition effect at three concentrations. Concentration of these compounds in soil samples was determined by HPLC. Furthermore, the autotoxic compounds were also found in the top soil of the commercially cultivated Rehmannia fields. It appears that a close link exists between the autotoxic effects on the seedlings and the compounds extracted from <b>fibrous</b> <b>roots</b> of Rehmannia...|$|R
