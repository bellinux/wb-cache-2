40|$|Based on a {{detailed}} analysis of the high-quality Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku data of the X-ray bright cluster of galaxies A 1795, we report clear evidence for a two-phase intracluster medium (ICM) structure, which consists of a cool (with a temperature T-c approximate to 2. 0 - 2. 2 keV) and a hot (T-h approximate to 5. 0 - 5. 7 keV) component that coexist and dominate the X-ray emission at least in the central 80 kpc. A third weak emission component (T- 3 approximate to 0. 8 keV) is also detected within the innermost 144 kpc and is ascribed to a portion of interstellar medium of the cD galaxy. Deprojected spectral analysis reveals flat radial temperature distributions for both the <b>hot</b> <b>phase</b> and cool phase components. These results are consistent with the ASCA measurements reported by Xu et al. and resemble the previous findings for the Centaurus Cluster. By analyzing the emission measure ratio and gas metal abundance maps created from the Chandra data, we find that the cool phase component is more metal-enriched than the <b>hot</b> <b>phase</b> one in the 50 - 100 kpc region, which agrees with that found in M 87. The coexistence of the cool phase and <b>hot</b> <b>phase</b> ICM cannot be realized by bubble uplifting from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) alone. Instead, the two-phase ICM properties are better reconciled with a cD corona model. In this model, the cool phase may be ascribed to the plasmas confined in magnetic loops, which are surrounded by the intruding <b>hot</b> <b>phase</b> ICM and have been polluted by metals synthesized in the cD galaxy. AGN feedback energy released in the innermost 10 kpc can serve as the heating source to prevent the loop-interior gas from cooling down to temperatures much lower than the observed value.
