5000|$|The {{two basic}} {{conceptual}} foundations of forensic identification {{is that everyone}} is individualized and unique. This individualization belief was invented by a police records clerk, Alphonse Bertillon, {{based on the idea}} that [...] "nature never repeats," [...] originating from the father of social statistics, Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet. The belief was passed down through generations being generally accepted, but it was never scientifically proven. There was a study done intending to show that no two fingerprints were the same, but the results were inconclusive. Many modern forensic and evidentiary scholars collectively agree that individualization to one object, such as a fingerprint, bite mark, handwriting, or <b>ear</b> <b>mark</b> is not possible. In court cases, forensic scientists can fall victim to observer bias when not sufficiently blinded to the case or results of other pertinent tests. This has happened in cases like United States v. Green and State v. Langill. Also, the proficiency tests that forensic analysts must do are often not as demanding to be considered admissible in court.|$|E

Traditionally this means the examination of the human skeleton in an attempt to either create biological boundaries of the deceased thus reducing the number of potential identifications, or to compare the remains with ante-mortem records to positively identify the deceased. Usually an osteological profile is generated containing estimates of biological sex, age at death and stature and information on pathologies and traumas. Current diversification and pioneering research within the field of forensic anthropology now means that forensic anthropologists can contribute towards the idenification of living individuals with the use of such methods as facial rcognition, <b>ear</b> <b>mark</b> identification and DNA analysis.

5000|$|Lamb marking is {{the term}} applied to the {{procedure}} of earmarking, castration and tail-docking of the lambs of domestic sheep. Vaccination is usually carried out then, too. Sheep are usually <b>ear</b> <b>marked</b> at approximately 3 months of age after lambing (birth). Lambs are castrated to prevent full development of reproductive organs and hormones. <b>Ear</b> <b>marking</b> is used to identify each lamb in the flock and tail-docking is usually carried out to prevent blowfly strike. At some stage, blow-flies lay their eggs within moist and warm areas (breech region) of the sheep. Then, the maggots grow and eat away the live flesh of the sheep. This causes great distress and pain for the lamb. Sometimes lambs are also mulesed (triangular cuts to the skin around the lamb's anus). This is also carried out for the same reason.|$|R

30|$|The modus operandi, {{which is}} also aided by the vastness of Zone 6, {{involves}} stealing of livestock (particularly cattle, small stock and, to the bemusement of Batswana, donkeys) from either country along the cordon fence by criminal syndicates or individuals, driving them further away from their usual grazing and watering points (cattle posts) and exchanging them with another stolen batch of livestock from the neighbouring country. Or instead of exchanging live animals, one could be sold stolen livestock, knowingly or not. In some instances, stolen livestock from Botswana could be herded illegally into Zimbabwe where they are further moved from the area of entry and later driven back into Botswana at a different locality where they are then reared or sold. Some local butcheries and unscrupulous individuals may provide the market for such stolen livestock, contrary to the legal process of inspection of animals before slaughter (Livestock and Meat Industries Act of 1962). This is further exacerbated by failure to brand and <b>ear</b> <b>mark</b> livestock as expected of livestock owners (Branding of Cattle Act). Because of the criminality of these movements, the cordon fence is almost always cut to facilitate cross-border movement or fence sections damaged by elephants used as crossing points.

40|$|Significant {{premiums}} can {{be realized}} in producing and marketing cattle through natural beef programs. However, if not executed with caution, the premiums can be quickly replaced with losses. “Natural” {{has been one of}} the hottest buzz words in feeder cattle sales over the last several years. The challenge is to make sure that everyone defines the term “natural” the same way. The “never-ever” programs seem to have been adapted as the industry’s gold standard. This standard requires natural cattle to “never-ever” have been given antibiotics or hormones of any kind from birth to harvest. Thus if you treat a calf for scours with an antibiotic, that calf cannot be represented as “natural”. It’s important to note that for most natural beef programs products such as Rumensin® and Bovatec® are considered antibiotics while MGA is also disallowed since it is a hormone. Remember, VACCINES ARE NOT ANTIBIOTICS and have a significant negative impact on the value of natural cattle if NOT used. Any producer has the ability to produce and market natural cattle. The key element that has kept a vast number of ranches from participating in the natural market is their failure to identify and record calves that have been treated with antibiotics due to sickness within a group of otherwise “naturally” managed cattle. This unique identity can be anything such as an <b>ear</b> <b>mark,</b> special tag, tag #; etc, along as treated cattle and natural cattle can be identified and separated for market differentiation. Many ranches already choose not to implant their calves but then fail to identify and record the calves they have treated with therapeutic antibiotics. In these cases, simple record keeping would allow the ranch to access the natural market with their calves. But, what is the ranch giving up if they quit implanting? You will get multiple answers for many different reasons, however the most common answers is “I don’t know for sure”. Everybody will say “pounds” but not many will know how many pounds for their specific operation...|$|E

5|$|After lambs {{are several}} weeks old, lamb <b>marking</b> (<b>ear</b> tagging, docking, and castrating) is carried out. Vaccinations are usually {{carried out at}} this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or <b>ear</b> <b>marks</b> are applied, for ease of later {{identification}} of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications. The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum {{is expected to have}} fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity. Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike. Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.|$|R
