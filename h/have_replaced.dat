5|$|In 1988, the East German {{leadership}} considered {{proposals to}} replace the expensive and intrusive fortifications with a high-technology system codenamed Grenze 2000. Drawing on technology used by the Soviet Army during the Soviet–Afghan War, it would <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> the fences with sensors and detectors. However, the plan was never implemented.|$|E

50|$|The Azerbaijani {{alphabet}} is {{the same}} as the Turkish alphabet, except for Әə, Xx, and Qq, the letters for sounds which do not exist as separate phonemes in Turkish. When compared to the historic Latin alphabet: Ğğ <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> the historic Ƣƣ (which was represented in Cyrillic by the stroked Ғғ); the undotted Iı (also used in Turkish) <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> the historic soft sign; the dotted İi (also used in Turkish) <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> the historic soft-dotted Ii; Jj <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> the historic Ƶƶ; Öö <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> the historic Ɵɵ; Üü <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> the historic Үy; and Yy <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> the historic Jj.|$|R
5|$|Many abelisaurid skull {{features}} are shared with carcharodontosaurids. These shared features, {{along with the}} fact that abelisaurids seem to <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> carcharodontosaurids in South America, have led to suggestions that the two groups were related. However, no cladistic analysis has ever found such a relationship and, aside from the skull, abelisaurids and carcharodontosaurids are very different, more similar to ceratosaurs and allosauroids, respectively.|$|E
5|$|A German {{victory on}} the Battle of Britain Day was unlikely. It {{could only have}} been {{possible}} if Park had made crass errors and had been caught on the ground. Stephen Bungay postulates that had the loss rates been reversed, Dowding could <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> those with reinforcements from his C units and carried on. Moreover, during both major engagements Fighter Command had used less than ½ of its strength. It {{would have been able to}} meet the Luftwaffe again on the morrow.|$|E
5|$|George, {{although}} increasingly {{reliant on}} Walpole, could still <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> his ministers at will. Walpole was actually {{afraid of being}} removed from office {{towards the end of}} George I's reign, but such fears were put to an end when George died during his sixth trip to his native Hanover since his accession as king. He suffered a stroke on the road between Delden and Nordhorn on 9 June 1727, and was taken by carriage to the Prince-Bishop's palace at Osnabrück where he died {{in the early hours of}} 11 June 1727. He was buried in the chapel of Leine Castle but his remains were moved to the chapel at Herrenhausen after World War II.|$|E

5|$|Heraclius the Elder is next {{mentioned}} in 608 as Patrician and Exarch of Africa. According to Patriarch Nikephoros, Heraclius the Elder {{had been appointed}} to the position by Maurice prior to the latter's deposition and death in 602. He might <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> Innocentius, a temporary exarch appointed between 598 and 600. The appointment suggests that Heraclius the Elder enjoyed the favor of Maurice and would have reason to remain loyal to him. Heraclius the Elder and his African court notably lamented the death and execution of Maurice and posthumously praised the fallen emperor.|$|E
5|$|In 1094, Domnall's uncle, Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland, drove Gofraid Crobán, King of Dublin and the Isles from Dublin, and may <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> {{him with}} Domnall himself. Certainly {{at some point}} {{following}} Gofraid's death in 1095, Muirchertach installed Domnall as King of the Isles. The latter's reign was short-lived however, and Domnall {{appears to have been}} forced from the Isles prior to its subsequent conquest by the King of Norway.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Bell {{began to}} lay off workers on the V-22 {{production}} line following the implementation of defense cuts, which had reduced the US order to about half the originally planned number of aircraft. Production rate went from 40 in 2012 to 22 planned for 2015. Manufacturing robots <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> older automated machines for increased accuracy and efficiency in production.

5|$|In {{military}} ordnance, tungsten or uranium {{is used in}} {{armour plating}} and armour piercing projectiles, {{as well as in}} nuclear weapons to increase efficiency (by reflecting neutrons and momentarily delaying the expansion of reacting materials). In the 1970s, tantalum was found to be more effective than copper in shaped charge and explosively formed anti-armour weapons on account of its higher density, allowing greater force concentration, and better deformability. Less-toxic heavy metals, such as copper, tin, tungsten, and bismuth, and probably manganese (as well as boron, a metalloid), <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> lead and antimony in the green bullets used by some armies and in some recreational shooting munitions. Doubts have been raised about the safety (or green credentials) of tungsten.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} since the Tornado's introduction, {{all of the}} Tornado {{operators}} have undertaken various upgrade and modification programmes to allow recently introduced weapons {{to be used by}} their squadrons. Amongst the new armaments that the Tornado has been adapted to deploy are the enhanced Paveway and Joint Direct Attack Munition bombs, and modern cruise missiles such as the Taurus and Storm Shadow missiles; these upgrades have increased the Tornado's capabilities and combat accuracy. Precision weapons such as cruise missiles <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> older munitions such as cluster bombs.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} who, if anyone, {{was in charge}} of the ship at this point, as Luke Collingwood had been gravely ill for some time. The man who would {{normally}} <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> him, first mate James Kelsall, had been previously suspended from duty following an argument on 14November. Robert Stubbs had captained a slave ship several decades earlier and he temporarily commanded Zong during Collingwood's incapacitation, but he was not a registered member of the vessel's crew. According to historian James Walvin, the breakdown of the command structure on the ship might explain the subsequent navigational errors and the absence of checks on supplies of drinking water.|$|E

5|$|On January 27, 2010, {{the day of}} President Barack Obama's State of the Union address, Ryan reintroduced a {{modified}} version of his Roadmap, H.R. 4529: Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2010. The modified plan would have provided across-the-board tax cuts by reducing income tax rates; eliminating income taxes on capital gains, dividends, and interest; and abolishing the estate tax and Alternative Minimum Tax. The plan would also <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> the corporate income tax with a border-adjusted business consumption tax of 8.5%. The plan would have privatized a portion of Social Security and reduced benefits for those under 55, eliminated the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance, and privatized Medicare and Medicaid.|$|E
5|$|The Crucifixion {{itself is}} conspicuously absent, {{and there is}} no trace or shadow of its {{presence}} in the panels. Writing in 1996, Wieland Schmied noted that the three Furies <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> Christ and the two thieves crucified on either side of him. The form of the Furies is borrowed directly from Picasso's late 1920s and mid-1930s pictures of biomorphs on beaches, in particular from the Spanish artist's The Bathers (1937). However, the eroticism and comedy of Picasso's figures have been replaced by a sense of menace and terror derived in part from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The current fish {{house was}} built between 1322 and 1335 when Adam of Sodbury was the Abbot of Glastonbury who also built the Church of St Mary {{in the village and}} the Manor House as his summer residence. It may <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> a {{previous}} abbey building. The upper floor was the abode of the chief fisherman when he visited intermittently and the ground floor was used for storing nets and the salting and preparing fish. Some alterations were made, probably in the 15th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning {{on a table}} in an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of 19th- and 20th-century missionaries has both transformed and maintained aboriginal integration. Many {{of the churches}} <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> earlier community functions, but continue to retain a sense of continuity and community that unites members of aboriginal societies against the pressures of modernity. Several church leaders have emerged from within the communities to take on leadership positions in petitioning {{the government in the}} interest of indigenous peoples and seeking a balance between the interests of the communities and economic vitality.|$|E
5|$|The present {{building}} {{incorporates the}} chancel from a 13th-century church which may <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> a wooden building {{of two or}} three centuries earlier. Additions in the 14thcentury included stone effigies representing a knight and his wife, considered to be excellent examples of such sculptures. More structural changes took place at regular intervals, and a major Victorian restoration by architect Somers Clarke included an extension to the nave and a new tower. English Heritage has listed the church at Grade I because of its architectural and historical importance.|$|E

25|$|Originally, a {{word was}} taken from Latin if the usual {{procedure}} did not produce a sufficiently international word. More recently, modern alternatives have become generally accepted. For example, the southern Romance comprar, meaning 'to buy', <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> emer, because the latter occurs only in derivatives in the control languages. Similarly, the modern form troppo, 'too' or 'too much', <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> nimis, and ma 'but' <b>has</b> largely <b>replaced</b> sed.|$|R
