40|$|Public Agricultural <b>Extension</b> <b>services</b> is {{becoming}} {{too expensive to}} finance by some developing countries. The external donors are gradually withdrawing while alternative ways of funding public extension are now being sought.

This paper, therefore, examines the practicability of implementing the private extension in Nigeria. It also discusses the various private <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> in other countries {{and the influence of}} globalization and liberalization on privatization of <b>extension</b> <b>services.</b> Necessary steps to take for the implementation of private Agricultural <b>Extension</b> <b>services</b> in Nigeria are highlighted.

40|$|In South Africa, rural women's <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> are {{frequently}} {{based on the}} Western, middle-class ideology of a woman's place being in the private or domestic sphere of the home. Consequently, almost all <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> have a home economics feature which advocates the teaching of Western-type domestic skills, such as sewing, crocheting, knitting, cookery and child care, to name a few. The home economics <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> offered to rural women are inappropriate and ineffective in relation to women's triple role pertaining to reproductive, economic and community managing activities. Furthermore, most of the <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> are irrelevant to the real conditions of poverty prevailing in rural areas.

30|$|With {{respect to}} support from <b>{{extension}}</b> <b>services,</b> {{the number of}} visits of extension agents is positively and significantly associated with the adoption of organic cotton farming. Organic cotton farmers benefit from intensive <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> from NGOs and development organizations, which are the major drivers of organic value chains in Benin and in West Africa in general. This confirms our expectations regarding the effect of extension on the adoption of organic cotton.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of agricultural <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> on beneficiaries of the Nguni Cattle project in Ncera and Kwezana villages, both in Nkonkobe local Municipality of the Eastern Cape Province. The objectives of this study were to determine the quality of <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> offered to the beneficiaries of the Nguni cattle project, relationship between extension officers and beneficiaries of the project, lastly was to determine communication strategies used by extension officers to communicate with the project beneficiaries. A total of 73 Nguni cattle project beneficiaries were interviewed. Semi- structured questionnaires were administered to the beneficiaries of the project who were willing to participate in the study. Xhosa speaking enumerators assisted in data collection. Focus group discussions were later carried out in both villages to determine effect of agricultural <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> on socio-economic status of the beneficiaries. The focus groups were divided into three groups of different ages and gender. The majority of the beneficiaries in the project were males (62. 2 % Ncera and 75 % Kwezana). There was an association between gender and <b>extension</b> <b>services.</b> Farmers depended on different sources of income. Old age pension and animal sales being the main contributing sources and also having a significant difference. The results of the study further revealed that the beneficiaries were faced with cattle production challenges, lack of <b>extension</b> support <b>services</b> being the main challenge. The results of the study indicated that the majority of beneficiaries had no access to <b>extension</b> <b>services.</b> Only 37. 8 % and 32. 1 % at Ncera and Kwezana respectively reported that they had access to <b>extension</b> <b>services.</b> Although the latter is the case it was further explained by the beneficiaries that <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> offered to them were of poor quality due to poor communication strategies used to provide these services. Beneficiaries also reported the relationship between them and extension officers’ as poor. It was concluded that <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> had an effect on beneficiaries of the Nguni cattle project, largely based on the constraints they face on the project and limited access to <b>extension</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R

A purposeful technique was adopted for sample selection while semi-structured questionnaires were used for data collection. A sample of 240 farmers made up of 30 cooperative and 30 non-cooperative farmers who had no formal education, 30 cooperative and 30 non-cooperative farmers who had primary school education, 30 cooperative and 30 non-cooperative farmers who had secondary school education and 30 cooperative and 30 non-cooperative farmers who had post secondary school education were used for the study. Two-way analysis of variance was used for data analysis. Results indicated that {{there was no significant difference}} (p> 0. 05) in cooperative and non-cooperative farmers’ access to <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> but the mean responses indicated that cooperative farmers had, slightly, more access to <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> more than non-cooperative farmers.

Furthermore, there was no significant (p> 0. 05) interaction effect of cooperative membership and farmers’ level of education on access to <b>extension</b> <b>services.</b> Based on the findings, the paper concluded that farmers’ level of education and cooperative membership did not affect access to <b>extension</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R
