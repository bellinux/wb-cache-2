5000|$|In May, 2011, Jacoby and Mayor Julián Castro of San Antonio debated, as the [...] "against" [...] team, {{the motion}} [...] "Don't {{give us your}} tired, your poor, your huddled masses," [...] with former Colorado Republican Congressman and Presidential {{candidate}} Tom Tancredo and Kansas Secretary of State and primary author of the Arizona immigration law (2010) Kris Kobach as the [...] "for" [...] team. The debate was broadcast by NPR and hosted by Intelligence Squared US with <b>John</b> <b>Donvan</b> as moderator. Tancredo and Kobach were declared the victors in the debate based on before and after polling of the live in-attendance audience, mostly {{because most of the}} self-identified undecided audience members decided in favor of the motion at the end. A slight majority of the audience opposed the motion, 54% before and 52% after. The debate motion was a play on the most famous lines (without the [...] "don't" [...] and with [...] "me," [...] not [...] "us") of Emma Lazarus' poem [...] "The New Colossus" [...] which is on a plaque at the Statue of Liberty.|$|E

In this program, ABC News anchor Ted Koppel and correspondent <b>John</b> <b>Donvan</b> explore the penalties of political dissent {{in the aftermath of}} the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

In order {{to look at the}} issue from two sides, Koppel is joined by House majority leader Dick Armey, who feels many of these technologies violate constitutional rights, and San Diego Police Chief David Bejarano, a strong advocate of his city's use of cameras at traffic intersections.
