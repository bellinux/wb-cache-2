All architecture is great architecture after sunset; perhaps architecture is really a nocturnal art, like the art of fireworks.

5000|$|The film is Verhoeven's {{most recent}} American production. In 2013, Verhoeven remarked to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I decided after Hollow Man, {{this is a}} movie, the first movie that I made that I thought I should not have made. It made money and this and that, {{but it really is}} not me anymore. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> other <b>people</b> could have done that. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> could have made RoboCop that way, or either Starship Troopers. But Hollow Man, I thought there might have been 20 {{directors}} in Hollywood who could have done that. I felt depressed with myself after 2002."

"The {{racial or}} ethnic end of it was not {{immediately}} apparent to me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> first get involved in racial politics, and then later decide that maybe Odinism or Asatrú attracts them.

5000|$|Jeff {{confessed to}} me his great remorse for his crimes. He {{wished he could}} do {{something}} for the families of his victims to make it right, but {{there was nothing he could}} do. He turned to God because there was no one else to turn to, but he showed great courage in his daring to ask the question, ‘Is heaven for me too?’ <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> are resentful of him for asking that question.

5000|$|The Royal Court Theatre held a 70th Birthday {{retrospective}} {{of her work}} by presenting readings of many of her most famous plays directed by notable playwrights, including Martin Crimp and Mark Ravenhill.Of course it's possible to trace recurring themes in Churchill's work - alienation between parent and child, the possibility and failure of revolution. But it is the variety of her work that is most striking. As Von Mayenburg says: [...] "With each play, she discovers new genres and forms. She then discards them and moves on, opening up possibilities for other playwrights to explore. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> writing today don't even realise they've been influenced by her. She's changed the language of theatre. And very few playwrights do that." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song has {{country and}} R&B influence, which Hunt {{expressed}} {{in an article}} with Billboard. Shane McAnally said of the influence: [...] "It's a model that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> could learn from, because you are still evolving as an artist along the way. Just because you put music out, it doesn't mean that is where you stop for the next year." [...] Hunt then discussed {{the process of making}} the song, saying it was born when he was [...] "singing that chorus melody late one night while riding around {{trying to come up with}} song ideas." [...] He originally [...] "didn't want to write anymore break up songs," [...] but the melody of the song changed his mind, saying it [...] "fit too perfectly not to go with it." ...|$|E

Thayil on the song:A nice ironic, final single in a way. People said there was a Beatles-ish element. I suppose there is a bit of Paul McCartney {{and a little bit of}} Lennon in the flavour of the song. Everyone in the band grew up with the Beatles and we had a certain degree of respect and admiration for them that's not uncommon. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> were Beatles fans, especially for that period in time. There's a number of acoustic guitars on the track as well and then, towards the end of the song, it gets louder and aggressive and goes to these power chords, and is maybe a little reminiscent of AC/DC.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the members}} of Cult of Luna decided they officially wanted to start {{working on a new}} album, they began {{messaging}} each other ideas of what they wanted it to sound like using books, films and photographs for inspiration. Cult of Luna first noted that their two previous albums, Somewhere Along the Highway and Eternal Kingdom, had very rural conceptual theme to them, so the band made the conscious effort to aim for a city theme with Vertikal. Common themes that arose out of the exchange of media for inspiration included Futurism and German Expressionism of the 1920s, in addition to compiling a list of ideas for how including: industrial, factory, monotone, repetitive, harsh and grey. One idea that prominently popped up during these discussions was Fritz Langs 1927 film Metropolis — a landmark film in German Expressionism. Cult of Luna drummer and percussionist Thomas Hedlund commented on the bands interest in the film, stating: [...] "We wanted to find a contrast to the previous albums. They were more rural, earthy and organic in a way. This time we wanted to explore the city; the machinery that is a society. Metropolis dealt with questions about belonging, the need for a change, human vs. machines, love. All of which were topics that we found inspiring in the making of this album." [...] Speaking on the importance of having a conceptual theme for an album, Persson said, [...] "I think one important aspect of artistic work is having boundaries and limits. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> do themselves a disservice by working too freely, as then you dont challenge yourself - anything can go." ...|$|E
40|$|Pierre Jacob's book, What Minds Can Do, {{is mainly}} {{concerned}} with intentionality. Jacob's {{primary goal is}} to explain both {{how it is possible}} for a physical system to have intentional mental states and how the intentional content of such mental states can {{play a role in the}} causal explanation of behaviour. Yet, he also tackles the issue of the nature of conscious experience. I shall focus here on a claim he makes in connection with this latter topic. The claim (made at the very end of Chapter 2, p. 77) is that in order to undergo states of consciousness a creature must have concept-forming abilities. At first sight, this contention seems implausibly strong. Although our intuitions in such matters may not be very reliable, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> would be willing to attribute to members of certain animal species a capacity to enjoy conscious experiences, while being reluctant to grant them concept forming abilities. The plausibility or implausibility of Jacob's claim depends in a large part on how one construes the notion of a conscious experience, as well as on what one considers concept-forming abilities to be. Since the topic of consciousness is rather peripheral in Jacob's book, the rejection of this claim would not directly affect his more central theses. Yet, examining it gives us a...|$|E

The film is titled, [...] "Woke Up Black" [...] and explores the attitudes, actions, and decisions of African-American youth. Of this documentary she is producing, Morten says [...] "I think the media is a powerful tool that is an under tapped resource. Anytime we can talk about issues, whether we're doing an interview on the radio, filming a documentary or using radio to make a presentation to policy makers, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that we tell the story in a much more compelling way and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> more <b>people</b> will hear it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that most of my goals will focus on media work." ...|$|R

5000|$|He {{considered}} {{that those who}} did not conform to traditional Roman Catholic mores were generally ill-suited to the public service, though that {{does not appear to have}} impeded his ascent through it that ended officially at ambassadorial level. He observed, There was nothing unusual even then about not believing in Catholicism. What was unusual then was to acknowledge publicly that you did not believe in Catholicism.... It is interesting that this did absolutely no harm to my public career around the mid-century - a time when the authority of a triumphant Catholic Church appeared to be overwhelmingly strong, in the media and in public life. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many</b> educated <b>people</b> - including <b>many</b> in the public service - already resented that authority and, while being discreet about this themselves, had some respect for a person who publicly rejected it altogether.|$|R

I want to first of all explain what neocons are and what they aren't...what neoconservatism is and what it isn't...to show people really that far from being a sort of awful cult or clique...that neoconservatives like myself simply believe certain things and view the world in certain ways. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>many,</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> share our opinion—it's not hard for people to see that it's not a prejudice to regard democracies and tyrannies as being on different moral planes".|$|R

[...] Regarding Bea Arthur's desire to entertain the audience of Maude, she said: [...] "I at least was; and I'm sure that Bea was very proud of being something that was socially significant that was entertaining people, and making them laugh, at the same time, slipping her philosophy." [...] Regarding Bea Arthur's decision to leave the show, Barbeau said: [...] "I think she was tired, but I also knew she wanted to go out strong, yet, we were still in the Top 20, right through the sixth season, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she was probably feeling, 'How many more scripts are there'?, and you know, where we can be as good as we've been!" [...] Of her overall experience on Maude, she said: [...] "It was wonderful, all the way through, and so much of that was because of Bea, because, we had such a great group of people that we were working with, who, we were like a family." [...] For more than 35 years, until Arthur's death in 2009, she and Barbeau continued to be good friends, long after the cancellation of Maude.

That's one thing. And also, we have a Mafia that is also involved in the political parties, so this keeps the abuse going. The second reason is a cultural factor. I don't know about other countries, but in Thailand the sexual behaviour of Thai men accepts prostitution. Every class of Thai men accept it, although not all Thai men practise it.

5000|$|While Disintegration mainly {{consists}} of sombre tracks, [...] "Lovesong", [...] "Pictures of You" [...] and [...] "Lullaby" [...] were equally popular for their accessibility. Smith {{wanted to create}} a balance on the album by including songs that would act as an equilibrium with those that were unpleasant. Smith wrote [...] "Lovesong" [...] as a wedding present for Mary Poole. The lyrics had a noticeably different mood {{than the rest of the}} record, but Smith felt it was an integral component of Disintegration: [...] "It's an open show of emotion. It's not trying to be clever. It's taken me ten years to reach the point where I feel comfortable singing a very straightforward love song." [...] The lyrics were a notable shift in his ability to reveal affection. In the past, Smith felt it necessary to disguise or mask such a statement. He noted that without [...] "Lovesong", Disintegration would have been radically different: [...] "That one song, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> makes <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> twice. If that song wasn't on the record, it would be very easy to dismiss the album as having a certain mood. But throwing that one in sort of upsets people a bit because they think, 'That doesn't fit'." [...] "Pictures of You", while upbeat, contained poignant lyrics ("Screamed at the make-believe/Screamed at the sky/You finally found all your courage to let it all go") with a [...] "two-chord cascade of synthesizer slabs, interweaving guitar and bass lines, passionate singing and romantic lyrics." [...] "Lullaby" [...] is composed of what Apter calls [...] "sharp stabs" [...] of rhythmic guitar chords with Smith whispering the words. The premise for the song came to Smith after remembering lullabies his father would sing him when he could not sleep: [...] "father would always make them up. There was always a horrible ending. They would be something like 'sleep now, pretty baby or you won't wake up at all.'" ...|$|R
