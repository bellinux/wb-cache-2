Hackerspaces allow like-minded individuals to share ideas, tools, and skillsets. Some notable hackerspaces which have been linked with the maker culture include Urban Workshop, Noisebridge, NYC Resistor, A2 Mech Shop, Pumping Station: One, Artisan's Asylum, danger!awesome, and TechShop. In addition, those who identify with the subculture can be found at more traditional universities with a technical orientation, such as MIT and Carnegie Mellon (specifically around [...] "shop" [...] areas like the MIT Hobby Shop and CMU Robotics Club). As maker culture becomes more popular, hackerspaces and <b>Fab</b> <b>Labs</b> are becoming more common in universities and public libraries. The federal government has started adopting the concept of fully open makerspaces within its agencies, the first of which (SpaceShop Rapid Prototyping Lab) resides at NASA Ames Research Center. In Europe the popularity of the labs is more prominent than in the US: about three times more labs exist there.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a growing {{technological}} sector – additive manufacturing – and discuss its hidden potential as frugal innovation. Additive manufacturing, which {{is also known as}} three-dimensional (3 D) printing, constitutes a recent manufacturing process that builds layers to create a three-dimensional solid object from a digital model. 3 D printing technology has been identified as one aspect of the digital revolution that has the potential to revolutionize the industrial world. This topic has been surrounded with a lot of hype when predicting future application scope. In this paper, we focus on 3 D printing as a technology that, under certain circumstances of technological transfer via community-operated organizations like <b>fab</b> <b>labs,</b> enables the development of frugal solutions targeting Base-of-the-Pyramid (BoP) population. At the same time, this paper aims to contribute to the discussion on Frugal Innovations in existing scholar literature...|$|R

We view new approaches to the process of urban area development and the introduction of the Smart City concept as prominent examples of potential transitional change in urban development and explore their possible synergies. In order to do so, we use the key concept of radical innovation and find that Urban Open Innovation Environments, such as <b>Fab</b> <b>Labs,</b> have most transitional potential. We conclude with some examples of these environments in the city of Rotterdam and preliminary success factors...|$|R

40|$|The rise in DIY and maker {{communities}} {{that has taken}} place over the last decade, including the growth of Hackspaces, <b>Fab</b> <b>Labs</b> and Maker Spaces, is not just about making: at its core it is a political development. It has been concerned with the empowerment of the individual in global, corporate societies, and with democracy on many different levels, gender included. There has been significant crossover between crafting communities such as Etsy and hackspaces. Make Magazine and Maker Faires have brought practical projects and arts and crafts activities alongside ‘tech’ in a neo-renaissance arts/science mash-up. Traditional roles and stereotypes have been questioned in the process. Electronic music has also been influenced by these cultural phenomena. In this article, DIY and maker communities and a maker’s ethos will be discussed in relation to issues of gender imbalance in electronic music as they exist particularly within academic institutions in the UK...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The free {{software}} and free culture movements have radi-cally changed {{the ways of}} producing software and knowledge goods. In many cases, participation in such project is benefit-driven rather than profit-driven. Participants get involved in order to realize some practi-cal or social benefit, not because of monetary gains. Another difference from market- and firm-based production is that peer production is non-hierarchical: people voluntarily cooperate as peers; there are no fixed em-ployer/employee or client/contractor relationships. And peer production is based on commons: goods which are jointly developed and maintained by a community and which are shared according to community-defined rules. Peer production {{is not just about}} producing knowledge: Hackerspaces and <b>Fab</b> <b>Labs</b> are the first forerunners of a commons-based production infrastructure. While commons-based peer production reaches beyond capitalism, the preconditions of its development are created by capitalism itself. The paradoxical relationship of capitalism to human labor leads to developments that might make the concept of labor (as we know it today) obsolete, and with it capitalism itself...|$|R
40|$|Western-derived maker {{movements}} and their associated <b>fab</b> <b>labs</b> and hackerspaces are being lauded {{by some as}} a global industrial revolution, responsible for groundbreaking digital “entanglements” that transform identities, practices and cultures at an unprecedented rate (Anderson 2014; Hills 2016). Assertions proliferate regarding the societal and entrepreneurial benefits of these “new” innovations, with positive impacts ascribed to everything, from poverty to connectivity. However, contradictory evidence has started to emerge, suggesting that a heterogeneous set of global cultural practices have been homogenized. This paper employs a materialist genealogical framework to deconstruct three dominant narratives about information technologies, which we call “technomyths” in the tradition of McGregor et al. After outlining the maker movement, its assumptions are examined through three lesser-cited examples: One Laptop per Child in Peru, jugaad in India and shanzhai copyleft in China. We then explore two preceding technomyths: Open Source and Web 2. 0. In conclusion, we identify three key aspects as constitutive to all three technomyths: technological determinism of information technologies, neoliberal capitalism and its “ideal future” subjectivities and the absence and/or invisibility of the non-Western...|$|R

50|$|The {{relations}} in DE {{are much more}} complex than those in a centralised economy. This feature makes the whole economy more stable - leaf nodes no longer rely on just one central node. It also resembles ecological networks, making it a good practical example of industrial ecology.A big advantage of DE is that it enables entities within the network to work much more with regional/local natural resources, finances, human capital, knowledge, technology, and so on. It also makes the entities more flexible {{to respond to the}} local market needs and thus generating a bigger innovation drive. By doing this, they become a better reflection of their social environment and in that way they can improve quality of life.The whole concept of DE is not at all a new invention - this is how most pre-industrial economies were organised. However, information technology has opened new doors for the concept: information can be shared much more easily and small-scale production facilities (rapid prototyping) are becoming cheaper.The DE concept works well with the development of <b>fab</b> <b>labs.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with Makerspaces, Hackerspaces and <b>Fab</b> <b>labs</b> (MHFL) in Norway. The study {{is based on the}} fact that the Norwegian government recognized that entrepreneurship is good for economic growth and thus is seeking to initiate measures to promote entrepreneurial culture. MHFL s seems to be one such measure because of how they facilitate access to social capital. But even though they have increased rapidly in recent years, literature have yet to study them with respect to entrepreneurial performance. My aim was therefore to find out what impact access to social capital in Norwegian MHFL s have on entrepreneurial activity. The methodological approach used to answer this question was a quantitative survey with emphasis on five point Likert scales. The survey was sent out to all the active MHFL s in Norway. After analyzing the results I found that social capital in Norwegian MHFL have impact on entrepreneurial activity in that it attracts entrepreneurs, but it does not have a significant impact on triggering entrepreneurial activity. Thus, the contributions from this thesis challenges the theoretical notion that social capital can be an accidental entrepreneurial trigger and proposes that it only works as a facilitator in the context of a MHFL...|$|R

But the current higher education systems are mostly teaching theoretical concepts rather than practical or applied cases. Makerspaces could become a bridge between universities and industry, particularly in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) careers. Makerspaces, also known as hackerspaces, hack <b>labs,</b> and <b>fab</b> <b>labs,</b> are open-access spaces where tools, machines and knowledge are shared with the purpose of implementing an idea. This communication evaluates the current status of the makerspaces at the world's top 10 universities in engineering and three of the most well-known Spanish ones, as well as the new campus makerspace created at the University of La Rioja. All the information was collected from universities' websites. Most of these reviewed universities have created outstanding makerspaces generally for the entire academic community. The Spanish 'Maker UPV' has been exceptionally successful promoting activities and projects in spite of the lack of resources reported. Lastly, the implementation of a new makerspace at the University of La Rioja (UR-Maker) is described with information about its organization, funding sources and activities already performed. This experience can represent an attractive guide for the academic community as other universities can explore the creation of new makerspaces on their own campus...|$|R
