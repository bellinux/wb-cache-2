5|$|In Facundo, Sarmiento is {{both the}} narrator and a main character. The book {{contains}} autobiographical elements from Sarmiento’s life, and he comments on the entire Argentine circumstance. He also expresses and analyzes his own opinion and chronicles some historic events. Within the book's dichotomy between civilization and barbarism, Sarmiento's character represents civilization, steeped as he is in European and North American ideas; <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> education and development, as opposed to Rosas and Facundo, who symbolize barbarism.|$|E
5|$|The goddesses {{find and}} restore Osiris's body, {{often with the}} help of other deities, {{including}} Thoth, a deity credited with great magical and healing powers, and Anubis, the god of embalming and funerary rites. Osiris becomes the first mummy, and the gods' efforts to restore his body are the mythological basis for Egyptian embalming practices, which sought to prevent and reverse the decay that follows death. This part of the story is often extended with episodes in which Set or his followers try to damage the corpse, and Isis and her allies must protect it. Once Osiris is made whole, Isis conceives his son and rightful heir, Horus. One ambiguous spell in the Coffin Texts may indicate that Isis is impregnated by a flash of lightning, while in other sources, Isis, still in bird form, fans breath and life into Osiris's body with her wings and copulates with him. Osiris's revival is apparently not permanent, and after this point in the story he is only mentioned as the ruler of the Duat, the distant and mysterious realm of the dead. Although he lives on only in the Duat, he and the kingship <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> will, in a sense, be reborn in his son.|$|E

500|$|John Neville {{has stated}} that he was {{originally}} hired for just two episodes of the series, but that his character [...] "was regularly brought back, because the audience simply doesn't know if <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> good or evil". Series creator Chris Carter has described the character {{in terms of his}} relationship with The Smoking Man, noting that the two characters can be seen as [...] "differing in approach, differing in philosophy and differing in personality". Writer Frank Spotnitz has described the Well-Manicured Man as [...] "sort of the white knight to the Cigarette-Smoking Man's black knight in this chess game that we were playing".|$|E
500|$|Hawes {{suggests}} that Kafka, though {{very aware of}} his own Jewishness, did not incorporate it into his work, which, according to Hawes, lacks Jewish characters, scenes or themes. In the opinion of literary critic Harold Bloom, although Kafka was uneasy with his Jewish heritage, he was the quintessential Jewish writer. Lothar Kahn is likewise unequivocal: [...] "The presence of Jewishness in Kafka's [...] is no longer subject to doubt". Pavel Eisner, one of Kafka's first translators, interprets [...] (The Trial) {{as the embodiment of}} the [...] "triple dimension of Jewish existence in Prague... his protagonist Josef K. is (symbolically) arrested by a German (Rabensteiner), a Czech (Kullich), and a Jew (Kaminer). <b>He</b> <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> the 'guiltless guilt' that imbues the Jew in the modern world, although {{there is no evidence that}} he himself is a Jew".|$|E

500|$|Liam Neeson reprises {{his role}} as the voice of the lion Aslan. Aslan is [...] "more parental here, [...] lets the kids, well, make their own mistakes". Aslan's {{entrance}} was filmed as a dream sequence to emphasize his messianic nature, and not make it reflect badly on his absence when Narnia is in turmoil. Although the character is considered C.S. Lewis' version of Jesus, Neeson [...] "see him more as the spirit of the planet – this living, breathing planet. That's what <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>for,</b> for me; more what the native Americans would believe." [...] As Aslan has fewer action scenes than in the first film, the animators found it difficult to make him move interestingly. His pose had to be regal, but if he moved his head too much, he would remind viewers of a dog. As well as having his size increased by fifteen percent, Aslan's eyes were also changed to look less [...] "Egyptian". Many of his shots were finished at the last minute.|$|E
500|$|To attract females, males make loud, low-frequency (below 100Hz) booming {{calls from}} their bowls by {{inflating}} a thoracic sac. They start with low grunts, which increase in volume as the sac inflates. After {{a sequence of}} about 20 loud booms, the male kakapo emits a high-frequency, metallic [...] "ching" [...] sound. <b>He</b> <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> a short while before again lowering his head, inflating his chest and starting another sequence of booms. The booms can be heard at least [...] away on a still night; wind can carry the sound at least [...] Males boom {{for an average of}} eight hours a night; each male may produce thousands of booms in this time. This may continue every night for three or four months during which time the male may lose half his body weight. Each male moves around the bowls in his court so that the booms are sent out in different directions. These booms are also notorious for attracting predators, because of the long range at which they can be heard.|$|E
500|$|Mars {{revealed}} to Billboard in September 2012 on {{a preview of}} his cover story that he recorded an album that represented his freedom. On his debut record, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, the singer reportedly had to change some things because of pressure from his label, something he was displeased with. He clarified that Unorthodox Jukebox was more of him and what <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>for,</b> mainly because he didn't have to modify things. He elaborated, [...] "If I'm changing things around because people might think it's a hard pill to swallow then I'm going {{to feel like a}} circus clown onstage, selling something fake". The variety of music styles presented on Unorthodox Jukebox resulted in his rejection from his label several times in the past; he also confessed that he had to face criticism by label presidents, who—according to him—expressed, [...] "Your music sucks, you don't know who you are, your music is all over the place, and we don't know how to market this stuff. Pick a lane and come back to us". To these statements, the singer added that he felt [...] "disgusted" [...] as he wanted to have the liberty to create his own music and not the music he was told to do.|$|E

500|$|Aesop {{featured}} {{wolves in}} several of his fables, playing on the concerns of Ancient Greece's settled, sheep-herding world. His most famous is the fable of The Boy Who Cried Wolf, which is directed at those who knowingly raise false alarms, and from which the idiomatic phrase [...] "" [...] is derived. Some of his other fables concentrate on maintaining the trust between shepherds and guard dogs in their vigilance against wolves, as well as anxieties over the close relationship between wolves and dogs. Although Aesop used wolves to warn, criticize and moralize about human behavior, his portrayals added to the wolf's image as a deceitful and dangerous animal. Isengrim the wolf, a character first appearing in the 12th-century Latin poem Ysengrimus, is a major character in the Reynard Cycle, where <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> the low nobility, whilst his adversary, Reynard the fox, represents the peasant hero. Although portrayed as loyal, honest and moral, Isengrim is forever the victim of Reynard's wit and cruelty, often dying {{at the end of}} each story. The tale of Little Red Riding Hood, first written in 1697 by Charles Perrault, is largely considered to have had more influence than any other source of literature in forging the wolf's negative reputation in the western world. The wolf in this story is portrayed as a potential rapist, capable of imitating human speech. The hunting of wolves, and their attacks on humans and livestock feature prominently in Russian literature, and are included in the works of Tolstoy, Chekhov, Nekrasov, Bunin, Sabaneyev, and others. Tolstoy's War and Peace and Chekhov's Peasants both feature scenes in which wolves are hunted with hounds and borzois. Farley Mowat's largely fictional 1963 memoir Never Cry Wolf was the first positive portrayal of wolves in popular literature, and is largely considered to be the most popular book on wolves, having been adapted into a Hollywood film and taught in several schools decades after its publication. Although credited with having changed popular perceptions on wolves by portraying them as loving, cooperative and noble, it has been criticized for its idealization of wolves and its factual inaccuracies.|$|E

2500|$|The Bronze Horseman symbolizes “Tsar Peter, {{the city}} of St Petersburg, and the uncanny reach of autocracy over the lives of {{ordinary}} people.” When Evgenii threatens the statue, he is threatening “everything distilled {{in the idea of}} Petersburg.” At first, Evgenii was just a lowly clerk that the Bronze Horseman could not deign to recognize because Evgenii was so far beneath him. However, when Evgenii challenges him, “Peter engages the world of Evgenii” as a response to Evgenii’s arrogance. The “statue stirs in response to his challenge” and gallops after him to crush his rebellion. [...] Before, Evgenii was just a little man that the Bronze Horseman would not bother to respond to. Upon Evgenii’s challenge, however, he becomes an equal and a rival that the Bronze Horseman must crush {{in order to protect the}} accomplishments <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>for.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Gardiner is {{most famous}} for his interpretations of Baroque music on period {{instruments}} with the Monteverdi Choir and the English Baroque Soloists, but his repertoire and discography {{are not limited to}} early music. With the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique Gardiner has performed a wide range of Classical and Romantic music, including many works of Berlioz and all of Beethoven's symphonies. A recording of the third symphony of the latter was used in a dramatisation by the BBC of Beethoven's writing of that symphony. Gardiner has served as chief conductor of the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra and has appeared as guest conductor with such major orchestras as the Berlin Philharmonic, Boston Symphony Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Philharmonia, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and Vienna Philharmonic. Gardiner is also well known for his refusal to perform the music of Richard Wagner; in a 2008 interview for Gramophone Gardiner said, 'I really loathe Wagner – everything <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> – and I don’t even like his music very much.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Mexican author Rogelio Villareal {{has noted}} how [...] "the famous image is not venerated by all ... {{it has also}} been aged, laughed about, parodied, insulted, and {{distorted}} around the world." [...] Conservative Mark Falcoff has remarked that Guevara is [...] "a cultural icon" [...] not because of [...] "his example for poor countries" [...] but as a result of [...] "his capacity to provoke empathy among the spoiled youth of the affluent West." [...] Historian Robert Conquest, of the Hoover Institution, has referred to such [...] "empathy" [...] and adulation among the young, as the [...] "unfortunate affliction" [...] of [...] "adolescent revolutionary romanticism." [...] Sean O'Hagan of The Observer contends that the appeal to such empathy is one of superficiality, remarking that [...] "if Che hadn't been born so good-looking, he wouldn't be a mythical revolutionary." [...] In the view of Ana Menéndez, author of the novel Loving Che, the fascination with Che is not with the man, but the photograph. While herself acknowledging him as a [...] "great idealist", Menéndez believes there is a [...] "fallibility of memory", which leads many to [...] "gloss over {{the fact that he was}} also a brutal man, the head of a firing squad in the opening days of the revolution." [...] Menéndez theorizes that such unsavory aspects are glossed over in the way one glosses over someone's flaws when in love. Jazz musician Paquito D'Rivera, himself a Cuban exile who fled the island after a run-in with Guevara, has criticized the positive portrayal of Che by musicians such as Santana, by noting the strict censorship of music at the time deemed [...] "immoral" [...] and [...] "imperialist" [...] by the Cuban government. In deference to such contradictions, Patrick Symmes, author of Chasing Che: A Motorcycle Journey in Search of the Guevara Legend, has hypothesized that [...] "the more time goes by, the chicer and chicer Che gets because the less <b>he</b> <b>stands</b> <b>for</b> anything." [...] Barcelona museum director Ivan de la Nuez, in the 2008 documentary [...] "Chevolution" [...] describes the overall phenomena by observing that [...] "Capitalism devours everything – even its worst enemies." ...|$|E
