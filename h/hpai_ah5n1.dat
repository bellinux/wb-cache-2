25|$|H5N1 {{is mainly}} spread by {{domestic}} poultry, both through {{the movements of}} infected birds and poultry products and {{through the use of}} infected poultry manure as fertilizer or feed. Humans with H5N1 have typically caught it from chickens, which were in turn infected by other poultry or waterfowl. Migrating waterfowl (wild ducks, geese and swans) carry H5N1, often without becoming sick. Many species of birds and mammals can be infected with <b>HPAI</b> <b>A(H5N1),</b> but the role of animals other than poultry and waterfowl as disease-spreading hosts is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{lethality}} and virulence of <b>HPAI</b> <b>A(H5N1),</b> its endemic presence, its increasingly large host reservoir, and its significant ongoing mutations, the H5N1 virus has recently been regarded to be the world's largest current pandemic threat, {{and billions of dollars}} are being spent researching H5N1 and preparing for a potential influenza pandemic. At least 12 companies and 17 governments are developing prepandemic influenza vaccines in 28 different clinical trials that, if successful, could turn a deadly pandemic infection into a nondeadly one. Full-scale production of a vaccine that could prevent any illness at all from the strain would require at least three months after the virus's emergence to begin, but it is hoped that vaccine production could increase until one billion doses were produced by one year after the initial identification of the virus.|$|E

50|$|Testing for {{a disease}} can be expensive, and {{distinguishing}} between two diseases can be prohibitively difficult in many countries. One standard means of determining {{if a person}} has had a particular disease is to test {{for the presence of}} antibodies that are particular to this disease. In the case of H5N1, for example, there is a low pathogenic H5N1 strain in wild birds in North America that a human could conceivably have antibodies against. It would be extremely difficult to distinguish between antibodies produced by this strain, and antibodies produced by Asian lineage <b>HPAI</b> <b>A(H5N1).</b> Similar difficulties are common, and make it difficult to determine how widely a disease may have spread.|$|E

50|$|The higher total case {{fatality}} ratio {{after the}} end of 2005 may reflect the widespread circulation in Vietnam of a less-lethal clade of H5N1 in 2005, which was subsequently brought under control. The change was nonetheless interpreted by some as indicating that the virus itself was becoming more deadly over time. In fact, when less-virulent strains die off, the surviving strains are the more virulent. Such difficulties in interpretation underscore that the global case fatality ratio can serve as but a crude and imperfect summary of the current complex situation with its many contributing factors, and not a clear or reliable predictive tool. If and when an influenza pandemic arises from one of the currently circulating pre-pandemic strains of Asian lineage <b>HPAI</b> <b>A(H5N1),</b> the mortality rates for the resulting human adapted pandemic strain cannot be predicted with any confidence.|$|E
