After the {{body was found}}, the public placed flowers near the scene. She wore only a pair of white leggings designed with a black polka-dot pattern. A zebra-print blanket was also inside the bag. Initially, police were unsure <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> additional bodies at the scene, so they attempted unsuccessfully to use cadaver dogs to locate any other possible remains.|$|E

25|$|The {{international}} {{prestige of}} Egypt declined considerably by this time.

25|$|The poem {{is similar}} to the {{conversation}} poems created by Coleridge, including Dejection: An Ode. The poems were not real conversations as there is no response to the narrator of the poem, but they are written as <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a response. The poems seek to have a response, though it never comes, and the possibility of such a voice though absence is a type of prosopopoeia. In general, Coleridge's poems discuss the cosmic as they long for a response, and it is this aspect, not a possible object of the conversation, that forms the power of the poem. Wordsworth took up the form in both Tintern Abbey and Ode: Intimations of Immortality, but he lacks the generous treatment of the narrator as found in Coleridge's poems. As a whole, Wordsworth's technique is impersonal and more logical, and the narrator is placed in the same position as the object of the conversation. The narrator of Wordsworth is more self-interested and any object beyond the narrator is kept without a possible voice and is turned into a second self of the poet. As such, the conversation has one of the participants lose his identity {{for the sake of the}} other and that individual represents loss and mortality.|$|E

Corey Mandell, the scriptwriter for the first film, was commissioned to deliver the script for the sequel, and Travolta, Pepper and producer Krane were all signed up to the sequel in their contracts for the first film.

They have another band again, they all have separate bands that they do themselves, I have Soundgarden and a solo career that's taking up a lot of time, and I just did Temple of the Dog. So, it's really honestly as simple as we end up having a window of time where it's comfortable for everybody and we want to do it, because I definitely feel like everybody's up for it."

500|$|Co-showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman co-wrote the episode's teleplay, while Pinkner, Wyman, and {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman co-wrote the story. Executive producer Joe Chappelle served as director. A full season renewal of Fringe was announced on March 24, 2011. They {{had written the}} finale without knowing <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> another season, but decided not to make any changes to the script even after hearing of its renewal. Pinkner explained that [...] "we wrote the episode, perhaps foolishly, assuming {{that we would be}} on for Season 4. We never for one second entertained that it {{would be the end of}} the series. So therefore, we didn't have to change a word!" [...] In an interview with the New York Post, Pinkner warned that events in the finale will [...] "unfurl in a very unexpected way for the characters and the audience". He also commented that the finale [...] "hopefully will make you sort of revisit and look at everything that's happened all year through a fresh pair of glasses".|$|E
500|$|Inspired by his {{enjoyment}} {{of his own}} botanical garden but primarily by Anna Seward's poem “Verses Written in Dr. Darwin's Botanic Garden” (1778), Darwin decided to compose a poem that would embody Linnaeus's ideas. (Darwin would later include an edited version of Seward's poem in The Loves of the Plants without her permission and without acknowledgement. Seward was rankled by this treatment and complained of Darwin's inattention to her authorial rights in her Memoirs of Erasmus Darwin.) According to Seward, Darwin said that “the Linnean System is unexplored poetic ground, and an [...] happy subject for the muse. It affords fine scope for poetic landscape; it suggests metamorphoses of the Ovidian kind, though reversed.” Darwin may have also thought of The Love of the Plants “as a kind of love song” to Elizabeth Pole, a woman with whom {{he was in love}} and would eventually marry. Concerned about his scientific reputation and curious to see <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> an audience for his more demanding poem The Economy of Vegetation, he published The Loves of the Plants anonymously in 1789 (see 1789 in poetry). He was stunned at its success and therefore published both Loves of the Plants and Economy of Vegetation together as The Botanic Garden in 1791. Joseph Johnson, his publisher, eventually bought the copyright for The Botanic Garden from him for the staggering sum of ₤800.|$|E

500|$|Gray's {{life was}} {{surrounded}} by loss and death, and many people that he knew died painfully and alone. In 1749, several events occurred that caused Gray stress. On 7 November, Mary Antrobus, Gray's aunt, died; her death devastated his family. The loss was compounded {{a few days later}} by news that his friend since childhood Horace Walpole had been almost killed by two highwaymen. Although Walpole survived and later joked about the event, the incident disrupted Gray's ability to pursue his scholarship. The events dampened the mood that Christmas, and Antrobus's death was ever fresh {{in the minds of the}} Gray family. As a side effect, the events caused Gray to spend much of his time contemplating his own mortality. As he [...] began to contemplate various aspects of mortality, he combined his desire to determine a view of order and progress present in the Classical world with aspects of his own life. With spring nearing, Gray questioned if his own life would enter into a sort of rebirth cycle or, should he die, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> anyone to remember him. Gray's meditations during spring 1750 turned to how individuals' reputations would survive. Eventually, Gray remembered some lines of poetry that he composed in 1742 following the death of West, a poet he knew. Using that previous material, he began to compose a poem that would serve as an answer to the various questions he was pondering.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Belgian dance group D.H.T.'s trance-cover of [...] "Listen to Your Heart" [...] {{became a}} {{worldwide}} club hit. Originally released in Belgium in 2003, by the mid-2005, the song {{reached the top}} 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, and was certified gold in October by the RIAA. Also that year, several songs were released as re-mixes and covers. Among them: two prominent versions of [...] "Fading Like a Flower", one a trance cover by German group Mysterio and one a sampling by Dancing DJs that reached the UK chart. In November 2005, while Gessle {{was in the middle}} of promoting his Son of a Plumber album, he and Fredriksson appeared at the Dorchester Hotel in London for an awards presentation by Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI). Gessle received two awards, the first for [...] "It Must Have Been Love", which by that time had been played on US radio more than 4 million times, while he and co-songwriter Mats Persson also received an award for Dance Song of the Year for D.H.T.'s cover of [...] "Listen to Your Heart". The ceremony marked the first time Gessle and Fredriksson had appeared in public together since before the onset of Fredriksson's brain tumour and subsequent surgery in 2002. When asked by an Aftonbladet reporter <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a Roxette reunion, Gessle replied, [...] "We haven't decided yet. No doors are closed. We're still young". Fredriksson returned in 2006 with an album of Swedish cover songs, titled Min bäste vän (My Best Friend), while Gessle recorded two more solo albums, En händig man (A Handy Man) (2007) and Party Crasher (2008).|$|E
500|$|There was a {{widespread}} debate among {{fans of the}} series as to who the character {{coming out of the}} closet would be, also similar to how they years earlier debated who shot the character Mr. Burns. Matt Groening joked at the Comic-Con convention that [...] "it's Homer". Many fans correctly guessed that it would be one of Homer's sisters-in-law, either Patty or Selma, while others believed it to be Waylon Smithers. It had for a long time been hinted on the show that the Smithers character was gay and in love with his boss Mr. Burns. However, as The Baltimore Sun writes, it would have been unlikely for Smithers to be the outed character because {{it would not have been}} a surprise to fans, and his love for his heterosexual boss would prevent him from marrying another person. Patty was suspected by fans and the press because she had not often been seen dating men on the show. The tabloid newspaper The Sun revealed already in September 2004 that the character who would come out was Patty, though this was regarded as a rumor and Jean would not confirm it. Bookmakers in the United States and the United Kingdom took bets on which character would be uncovered as homosexual, and <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a kiss featured in the episode—BetUS laid odds at four to five that it was Patty, while Smithers had four to one odds and Ned Flanders fifteen to one odds. A kiss was given odds of seven to five. BetUS said gamblers made more than 900 bets on the coming-out on their website. According to The Baltimore Sun, another betting site named PaddyPower.com [...] "stopped taking wagers because so much money was being placed on [...]" [...] Jean told The Advocate that he thought it was [...] "an insane thing for someone to take bets on a result that can be determined by other people", referring to the Simpsons staff, [...] "and could be changed by them at the last minute." ...|$|E
