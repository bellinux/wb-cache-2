The advantage of having self-supporting membranes as is the ease at which it can be cleaned due to its ability to be backflushed. Replacement costs however are high, as one faulty fibre will require the whole bundle to be replaced.

MARS banks on the recycling of albumin solution via an anion exchanger and active charcoal. The patient's blood is led through the <b>hollow</b> <b>fibre</b> capillaries of a high-flux dialysis filter. Albumin solution, which is circulated in the extracorporeal circuit, passes the membrane counter directionally, allowing albumin-bound toxins in the blood to cross the membrane and bind to the albumin of the MARS circuit. The membrane is, however, impermeable to albumin. When passing the adsorber and filter cartridges, the toxins are cleared by the filter and albumin is regenerated and able to accept new toxins when passing the membrane again. Additionally, the albumin circuit itself is dialysed in the method of continuous veno-venous haemodialysis (CVVHD) or continuous veno-venous heamodiafiltration (CVVHDF), diminishing the load of water-soluble toxins.|$|E

The treatment facility uses a membrane bioreactor process, manufactured and supplied by GE/Zenon, consisting of two bioreactor tanks and an ultrafiltration (<b>hollow</b> <b>fibre)</b> membrane tank, followed by chlorination to remove colour and disinfect the reclaimed water. The treatment system is designed for an average daily flow of 75 cubic metres per day (20,000 gpd), and maximum flows of up to 150 cubic metres per day (40,000 gpd). With the City of Vancouver 2012 commercial metered water and sewer rates at $2.803 and $1.754, respectively, the convention centre can save over $21,000 per month in utility fees through water reuse.

50|$|SATRA {{played a}} role in the {{successful}} expedition to the top of Mount Everest in 1953 in which Sir Edmund Hillary, along with Tenzing Norgay, became the first person to 'stand on top of the world'. In 1952, SATRA was approached by The British Expedition to produce 34 pairs of boots to meet the challenge of climbing in one of the most inhospitable environments on the planet. The boots were designed to provide a high level of thermal insulation for use in high altitude and saw a combination of inner vapour barrier, mesh insoles and an integrated rubber outer gaiter: the water resistant vapour barrier’s inner layer stopped the boots becoming soaked with sweat then freezing; the mesh insole allowed sweat to disperse from the socks; the outer gaiter prevented melting snow soaking in to the boot itself. In addition, there were five layers of kapok, a natural <b>hollow</b> <b>fibre</b> and a forerunner of synthetic versions. The boot lasting technique helped prevent compression of the vital insulation material and microcellular resin soles further improved insulation and decreased weight. The end result was boots that weighed only 4 lb 4oz and a successful expedition in which no-one who wore the boots got frostbite - a remarkable achievement.|$|E

The introduction of microporous <b>hollow</b> <b>fibres</b> with very low resistance to mass transfer revolutionized the design of membrane modules, as the limiting factor to oxygenator performance became the blood resistance.

50|$|A type of ion {{exchange}} chromatography, membrane exchange {{is a relatively}} new method of purification designed to overcome limitations of using columns packed with beads. Membrane Chromatographic devices are cheap to mass-produce and disposable unlike other chromatography devices that require maintenance and time to revalidate. There are three types of membrane absorbers that are typically used when separating substances. The three types are flat sheet, <b>hollow</b> <b>fibre,</b> and radial flow. The most common absorber and best suited for membrane chromatography is multiple flat sheets because it has more absorbent volume. It can be used to overcome mass transfer limitations and pressure drop, making it especially advantageous for isolating and purifying viruses, plasmid DNA, and other large macromolecules. The column is packed with microporous membranes with internal pores which contain adsorptive moieties that can bind the target protein. Adsorptive membranes are available in a variety of geometries and chemistry which allows them to be used for purification and also fractionation, concentration, and clarification in an efficiency that is 10 fold that of using beads. Membranes can be prepared through isolation of the membrane itself, where membranes are cut into squares and immobilized. A more recent method involved the use of live cells that are attached to a support membrane and are used for identification and clarification of signaling molecules.|$|E
50|$|Contemporary {{research}} in the area of Nanofiltration (NF) technology is primarily concerned with improving the performance of NF membranes, minimising membrane fouling and reducing energy requirements of already existing processes. One way in which researchers are attempting to improve NF performance - more specifically increase permeate flux and lower membrane resistance - is through experimentation with different membrane materials and configurations. thin film composite membranes (TFC), which consist of a number of extremely thin selective layers interfacially polymerized over a microporous substrate, have had the most commercial success in industrial membrane applications due to the capability of optimizing the selectivity and permeability of each individual layer. Recent research has shown that the addition of nanotechnology materials such as electrospunnanofibrous membrane layers (ENMs) to conventional TFC membranes results in an enhanced permeate flux. This has been attributed to inherent properties of ENMs that favour flux, namely their interconnected pore structure, high porosity and low transmembrane pressure. A recently developed membrane configuration which offers a more energy efficient alternative to the commonly used spiral wound arrangement is the <b>hollow</b> <b>fibre</b> membrane. This format has the advantage of requiring significantly less pre-treatment than spiral wound membranes, as solids introduced in the feed are displaced effectively during backwash or flushing. As a result, membrane fouling and pre-treatment energy costs are reduced. Extensive research has also been conducted on the potential use of Titanium Dioxide (TiO2, titania) nanoparticles for membrane fouling reduction. This method involves applying a nonporous coating of titania onto the membrane surface. Internal fouling/pore blockage of the membrane is resisted due to the nonporosity of the coating, whilst the superhydrophilic nature of titania provides resistance to surface fouling by reducing adhesion of emulsified oil on the membrane surface.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the activity of compounds tested in pre-clinical in vivo and in vitro assays by the National Cancer Institute's Developmental Therapeutics Program was performed. For 39 agents with both xenograft data and Phase II clinical trials results available, in vivo activity in a particular histology in a tumour model did not closely correlate with activity in the same human cancer histology, casting doubt on the correspondence of the pre-clinical models to clinical results. However, for compounds with in vivo activity in at least one-third of tested xenograft models, there was correlation with ultimate activity {{in at least some}} Phase II trials. Thus, an efficient means of predicting activity in vivo models remains desirable for compounds with anti-proliferative activity in vitro. For 564 compounds tested in the <b>hollow</b> <b>fibre</b> assay which were also tested against in vivo tumour models, the likelihood of finding xenograft activity in at least one-third of the in vivo models tested rose with increasing intraperitoneal <b>hollow</b> <b>fibre</b> activity, from 8 % for all compounds tested to 20 % in agents with evidence of response in more than 6 intraperitoneal fibres (P< 0. 0001). Intraperitoneal <b>hollow</b> <b>fibre</b> activity was also found to be a better predictor of xenograft activity than either subcutaneous <b>hollow</b> <b>fibre</b> activity or intraperitoneal plus subcutaneous activity combined. Since <b>hollow</b> <b>fibre</b> activity was a useful indicator of potential in vivo response, correlates with <b>hollow</b> <b>fibre</b> activity were examined for 2304 compounds tested in both the NCI 60 cell line in vitro cancer drug screen and <b>hollow</b> <b>fibre</b> assay. A positive correlation was found for histologic selectivity between in vitro and <b>hollow</b> <b>fibre</b> responses. The most striking correlation was between potency in the 60 cell line screen and <b>hollow</b> <b>fibre</b> activity; 56 % of compounds with mean 50 % growth inhibition below 10 – 7. 5  M were active in more than 6 intraperitoneal fibres whereas only 4 % of compounds with a potency of 10 – 4  M achieved the same level of <b>hollow</b> <b>fibre</b> activity (P< 0. 0001).

40|$|The {{development}} of {{photonic crystal fibre}} from conventional optical fibre follows a trend in the {{development of}} materials, to create composites and structured materials on smaller and smaller scales. In fact the great success of photonic crystal fibre is largely due to the ability to structure it on scales comparable to the wavelength of light. It is this micron size structure that allows the creation of an (out of plane) optical bandgap in silica and allows <b>hollow</b> core <b>fibre</b> to guide light in an air core freeing the guided mode from the properties of bulk silica. This thesis focuses on the propagation and compression of high peak power optical solitons in <b>hollow</b> core <b>fibre.</b> As the Kerr nonlinear response of air is approximately a thousand times less than that of silica, the air core of <b>hollow</b> core <b>fibre</b> can support much higher peak powers than conventional optical fibre without the manifestation of nonlinear effects, making it ideal for the delivery of high peak power laser pulses. Coupled with this, <b>hollow</b> core <b>fibre</b> has a large region of anomalous dispersion in its transmission window allowing optical pulses to be transmitted as temporal solitons freeing them from the effects of dispersion. The author started his Ph. D. in 2006, three years after the first demonstration of soliton propagation in <b>hollow</b> core <b>fibre</b> and as the first demonstrations of soliton compression in <b>hollow</b> core <b>fibre</b> were being undertaken. Work by the author to build upon these early demonstrations is presented in this thesis in the following manner: Chapters 1, 2 and 3 are theory chapters. Chapter 1 explains the background waveguide theory and theory of nonlinear optics that is used throughout the thesis. Chapter 2 details the properties of photonic crystal <b>fibres</b> focusing on <b>hollow</b> core <b>fibre.</b> Chapter 3 details recent papers relevant to the propagation and compression of solitons in <b>hollow</b> core <b>fibre.</b> Chapters 4, 5 and 6 are experimental chapters reporting work undertaken by the author. Chapter 4 focuses on modifying the nonlinearity of <b>hollow</b> core <b>fibre</b> and measuring the dispersion of <b>hollow</b> core <b>fibre</b> accurately. Chapter 5 focuses on the compression of chirped and unchirped picosecond pulses in dispersion decreasing <b>hollow</b> core <b>fibre</b> tapers.

40|$|Sorbent <b>hollow</b> <b>fibres,</b> {{generally}} {{prepared by}} fully encapsulating an adsorbent within a polymer binder such as polyethersulfone (PES), provide a low pressure drop alternative to conventional packed beds. These fibres {{have a high}} external surface area to volume ratio, enabling smaller bed sizes, and a highly porous structure resulting in low mass transfer resistance while maximising sorption efficiency. However, adsorbent <b>hollow</b> <b>fibres</b> prepared with PES suffer from loss of some adsorption capacity due to the polymer binder. This paper describes a novel formulation of composite <b>hollow</b> <b>fibres</b> containing activated carbon and PIM- 1, a polymer of intrinsic microporosity, as an active binder designed to enhance the total adsorption capacity. Octane has been selected as a model hydrocarbon, and nitrogen and octane isotherms are reported for both PES and PIM- 1 based <b>hollow</b> <b>fibres,</b> each containing the same activated carbon. Theoretical BET surface areas were calculated {{for each type of}} fibre based on a weighted average of the surface areas of its individual components (i. e. polymer and carbon). The measured surface area of the PIM- 1 fibres was remarkably consistent with the theoretical value, while the measured surface area and octane uptake for PES fibres were ∼ 10 % lower than the theoretical values, indicating some blockage of the adsorbent by the polymer matrix. PIM- 1 adsorbent fibres were found to fully utilise the capacity of the supported carbon, as well as providing additional sites for adsorption on the polymer, resulting in a maximum octane uptake of 50 % w/w-approximately twice that of the PES-based fibres...|$|R

We evaluated the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (P aO 2) of 10 patients who used the new device.

Sf Intense monocycle pulses (sub- 5 -fs) play an im-portant role in many scientific and technological re-search fields, such as the production of single attosec-ond pulses by high-order harmonics, time-resolved measurements of electron dynamics in atoms and molecules. Combined with the technique of gas-filled <b>hollow</b> <b>fibres</b> and feedback phase compression, researchers has achieved the shortest pulse duration 2. 8 fs in the visi-ble light range.

40|$|Nanocomposite MFI-alumina <b>hollow</b> <b>fibres</b> and {{membrane}} tubes {{have been}} prepared by pore-plugging hydrothermal synthesis and tested in the separation of xylene vapour mixtures. Single component and ternary xylene isomer mixtures diluted in N 2 gas have been fed into the membrane lumen, while N 2 gas swept over the outer membrane surface. The fibres showed a maximum p-xylene flux of 4. 5 μmol m 2 s- 1 at 573 K for p/m/o-xylene partial pressures 0. 62 kPa/ 0. 27 kPa/ 0. 32 kPa, the pxylene to o-xylene (p/o) separation factor showing a value of 107. As expected for a nanocomposite material, xylene fluxes show no indication of flux increase beyond 573 K due to pore opening. When comparing MFI-alumina <b>hollow</b> <b>fibres</b> to membrane tubes, the surface-to-volume ratios can be increased by one order of magnitude, allowing for more compact and cost-effective units. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Organometallic {{complexes}} {{offer the}} prospect of targeting multiple pathways {{that are important in}} cancer biology. Here, the preclinical activity and mechanism(s) of action of a silver-bis(N-heterocyclic carbine) complex (Ag 8) were evaluated. Ag 8 induced DNA damage via several mechanisms including topoisomerase I/II and thioredoxin reductase inhibition and induction of reactive oxygen species. DNA damage induction was consistent with cytotoxicity observed against proliferating cells and Ag 8 induced cell death by apoptosis. Ag 8 also inhibited DNA repair enzyme PARP 1, showed preferential activity against cisplatin resistant A 2780 cells and potentiated the activity of temozolomide. Ag 8 was substantially less active against non-proliferating non-cancer cells and selectively inhibited glycolysis in cancer cells. Ag 8 also induced significant anti-tumour effects against cells implanted intraperitoneally in <b>hollow</b> <b>fibres</b> but lacked activity against <b>hollow</b> <b>fibres</b> implanted subcutaneously. Thus, Ag 8 targets multiple pathways of importance in cancer biology, is less active against non-cancer cells and shows activity in vivo in a loco-regional settin...|$|R
