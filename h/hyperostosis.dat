5|$|The bones show {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans). The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a knight. One skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19skeletons, ten of which were cases of spina bifida occulta. Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae. Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases. One cranium contained a large circular lesion {{which may have been}} the consequence of trepanning. Other diseases specific to bones and joints were osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal <b>hyperostosis</b> (DISH), and possible cases of spondyloarthropathy. Three skeletons showed possible evidence of rickets, two had changes of osteoporosis, and three crania had features of <b>hyperostosis</b> frontalis interna, a metabolic condition affecting post-menopausal women. Osteomata (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.|$|E
5|$|Several Smilodon fossils {{show signs}} of {{ankylosing}} spondylitis, <b>hyperostosis</b> and trauma; some also had arthritis, which gave them fused vertebrae. One study of 1,000 Smilodon skulls found that 30% of them had eroded parietal bones, {{which is where the}} largest jaw muscles attach. They also showed signs of microfractures, and the weakening and thinning of bones possibly caused by mechanical stress from the constant need to make stabbing motions with the canines. Bony growths where the deltoid muscle inserted in the humerus is a common pathology for a La Brea specimen, which was probably due to repeated strain when Smilodon attempted to pull down prey with its forelimbs. Sternum injuries are also common, probably due to collision with prey. Some bones also show evidence of having been bitten by other Smilodon, with one skull showing an unhealed wound from a canine, seemingly fatal, and a scapula from the same site that had been pierced by a canine. The frequency of trauma in S. fatalis specimens was 4.3%, compared to 2.8% in the dire wolf, which implies the ambush predatory behavior of the former led to greater risk of injury than the pursuit predatory behavior of the latter. Smilodon remains exhibit relatively more shoulder and lumbar vertebrae injuries.|$|E

25|$|It {{was long}} assumed that iron {{deficiency}} anemia has marked effects on the flat bones of the cranium of infants and young children. That as the body attempts to compensate for low iron levels by increasing red blood cell production in the young, sieve-like lesions develop in the cranial vaults (termed porotic <b>hyperostosis)</b> and/or the orbits (termed cribia orbitalia). This bone is spongy and soft.|$|E
25|$|S.O.Y. Keita and A.J. Boyce, {{authors of}} Variation in Porotic <b>Hyperostosis</b> in the Royal Cemetery Complex at Abydos, Upper Egypt: A Social Interpretation, {{examined}} forty-four skulls from the funerary complex of King Djer {{and discovered that}} those buried outside the tomb enjoyed better health {{than those in the}} actual tomb. This can be interpreted in two ways. First, those buried outside the tomb were believed to have enjoyed better health because they were wealthier, and consequently, had better nutritional standards. The second is that those buried inside the royal tomb could afford {{to take care of their}} illness-ridden children. Whichever explanation is correct, there is such a statistically significant difference that these two groups most likely did not share the same social status.|$|E

Also present was a healed fracture in the dentary and what the authors describing the specimen referred to as [...] "a mushroom-like <b>hyperostosis</b> of a right pedal phalanx."

500|$|In a 1986 {{article in}} the British Medical Journal, Michael Cohen and J.A.R. Tibbles put forward the theory that Merrick had {{suffered}} from Proteus syndrome, a very rare congenital disorder recently identified by Cohen in 1979 (this explains why this diagnosis was not advanced previously), citing [...] Merrick's lack of reported café au lait spots {{and the absence of}} any histological proof that he had suffered from the previously conjectured syndrome. In fact, Proteus syndrome affects tissue other than nerves, and it is a sporadic disorder rather than a genetically transmitted disease. Cohen and Tibbles said that Merrick showed the following signs of Proteus syndrome: [...] "macrocephaly; <b>hyperostosis</b> of the large skull; hypertrophy of long bones; and thickened skin and subcutaneous tissues, particularly of the hands and feet, including plantar hyperplasia, lipomas, and other unspecified subcutaneous masses." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is however, highly {{unlikely}} that iron deficiency anemia is a cause of either porotic <b>hyperostosis</b> or cribra orbitalia. These are more likely the result of vascular activity in these areas and {{are unlikely to be}} pathological.

[...] However, dietary deficiencies are the most probable cause.|$|E
2500|$|The villagers' {{skeletal}} remains, {{as well as}} {{the fact}} that remains of canines were buried with the villagers, provide evidence of extensive nutritional deficiencies of a chronic nature. According to Zimmerman’s 1985 book, Peoples of Prehistoric South Dakota, the bones reveal several ailments related to chronic malnutrition. As stated in Zimmerman’s book, [...] "one of the most common characteristics was a pitting {{in the top of the}} eye sockets called cribra orbitalis. Associated with this on several skulls was porotic <b>hyperostosis,</b> a pitting on the back of the skull". Both of these conditions are caused by a [...] deficiency of iron in the diet. In addition to these ailments, Harris lines (an indicator of insufficient amounts of protein and other essential minerals, as well as truncated episodes of growth) were discovered while examining radiographs of several individuals. The Crow Creek villagers were measured as being shorter than their Arikara descendants, with the females being significantly shorter; this could have been another effect of nutritional deficiencies and illness.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} {{discussion in the}} scientific literature regarding the possible conspecifity of the Pacific crevalle jack, Caranx caninus, with Caranx hippos. Arguments ranged from the species being conspecific, subspecific or as individual species. This {{led to the creation}} of two trinomial names; Caranx hippos hippos and Caranx hippos tropicus. The former was an attempt to separate the 'subspecies' on each side of the Americas, while the latter was an unnecessary name to divide the Atlantic Caranx hippos into subspecies. The most recent review of the species complex by Smith-Vaniz and Carpenter treated the fish as separate species, citing differences in the development of <b>hyperostosis</b> and differing anal fin colours as evidence of species status. The species' most often used common name, crevalle jack (or 'jack crevalle') is based on the word [...] "cavalla", an earlier word used for the jacks. Other names include common jack, black-tailed trevally, couvalli jack, black cavalli, yellow cavalli and a host of generic names, such as horse mackerel and crevalle.|$|E
