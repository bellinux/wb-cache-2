5|$|In 1818 the 49th {{parallel}} {{was established}} as {{the boundary between}} the United States and British North America. However, the point where the Red River crossed this line was not marked until 1823, when Stephen Long conducted a survey expedition. The expedition determined, among other things, that the fur trading post of Pembina lay <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> the U.S. border.|$|E
5|$|The inner moons {{are closely}} {{associated}} with Neptune's rings. The two innermost satellites, Naiad and Thalassa, orbit between the Galle and LeVerrier rings. Despina may be a shepherd moon of the LeVerrier ring, because its orbit lies <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> this ring. The next moon, Galatea, orbits <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> {{the most prominent of}} Neptune's rings, the Adams ring. This ring is very narrow, with a width not exceeding 50km, and has five embedded bright arcs. The gravity of Galatea helps confine the ring particles within a limited region in the radial direction, maintaining the narrow ring. Various resonances between the ring particles and Galatea may also have a role in maintaining the arcs.|$|E

5|$|The λ {{ring was}} one of two rings {{discovered}} by Voyager 2 in 1986. It is a narrow, faint ring located <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> the ε ring, between it and the shepherd moon Cordelia. This moon clears a dark lane <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> the λ ring. When viewed in back-scattered light, the λ ring is extremely narrow—about 1–2km—and has the equivalent optical depth 0.1–0.2km at the wavelength 2.2μm. The normal optical depth is 0.1–0.2. The optical depth of the λ ring shows strong wavelength dependence, which is atypical for the Uranian ring system. The equivalent depth is as high as 0.36km in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, which explains why λ ring was initially detected only in UV stellar occultations by Voyager 2. The detection during a stellar occultation at the wavelength 2.2μm was only announced in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Being located <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> the Lions' Gate, one of {{the major}} entries to the Old City, the East Jerusalem Development Company {{initially}} intended to excavate the reservoir and build a multi-storey car park at the site. This post-1967 plan was rejected by the waqf authorities who own the plot because they feared that clearance work {{at the base of the}} Temple Mount would endanger the Haram compound. Subsequently, in 1981 a small square equipped with benches was constructed on part of the covered pool.|$|E
5|$|Farther east, {{the road}} {{passes through the}} hamlets of Gardiner and Clintondale, and meets US9W in the hamlet of Highland. <b>Just</b> <b>inside</b> of Gardiner, the highway passes through Minnewaska State Park, a large state park in the Hudson Valley. US44 and NY55 join US9W for roughly a half-mile southward along the western bank of the Hudson River before {{separating}} at a trumpet interchange south of Highland. One mile east of US9W, US44 and NY55 cross the Hudson on the Mid-Hudson Bridge.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, when M-40 was extended, M-89 was rerouted out of Allegan to the {{southeast}} along its present-day alignment to terminate at US131 in Plainwell. Just a few years later, the road was extended further to {{the southeast}} to Richland then east along its present-day routing to end at M-96 in Augusta. In 1931, the route was realigned to run east, rather than south into Augusta, where it then met up with M-96 <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> the Calhoun County line. The road remained in this fashion for the next 20 years.|$|E
5|$|In Elbridge, NY321 intersects {{with several}} county routes, {{including}} Halfway Road (CR107; former NY368), a connector highway {{leading to the}} hamlet of Halfway. Soon afterwards, NY321 turns to the northeast, heading towards NY5. The highway intersects Forward Road (unsigned NY931F) <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> the Camillus town line soon after the turn. Forward Road, a local road that passes through a mixture of open fields and forests, serves as a connector between NY321 and NY174.|$|E
5|$|In May 1861, Isham G. Harris, the {{governor}} of Tennessee, appointed the state's attorney, Daniel S. Donelson, as a brigadier general and directed him to build fortifications on the rivers of Middle Tennessee. Donelson found suitable sites, but they were within the borders of Kentucky, still a neutral state at that time. Moving upriver, <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> the Tennessee border, Donelson selected {{the site of the}} fort on the Cumberland River that would bear his name. Colonel Bushrod Johnson of the Tennessee Corps of Engineers approved of the site.|$|E

5|$|Islamic {{reverence for}} the site {{is derived from the}} belief that the prophet Mohammed tied his miraculous steed Buraq nearby during his night journey to Jerusalem. Various places have been {{suggested}} for the exact spot where Buraq was tethered, but for several centuries the preferred location has been the al-Buraq mosque, which is <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> the wall {{at the south end of}} the present Western Wall plaza. The mosque is located above an ancient passageway, which once came out through the long-sealed Barclay's Gate whose huge lintel is still visible directly below the Maghrebi gate.|$|E
5|$|Launched in 1983, {{the space}} {{telescope}} IRAS detected infrared emissions from stars near to the Sun, including an excess infrared emission from Epsilon Eridani. The observations indicated a disk of fine-grained cosmic dust was orbiting the star; this debris disk has since been extensively studied. Evidence for a planetary system was discovered in 1998 by the observation of asymmetries in this dust ring. The clumping in the dust distribution {{could be explained by}} gravitational interactions with a planet orbiting <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> the dust ring.|$|E

Gateway Lane and NY120A both end <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> the state line at an {{intersection}} with NY120.

While the Secretariat building is most predominantly featured in depictions of the headquarters, it also includes the domed General Assembly building, the Dag Hammarskjöld Library, as well as the Conference and Visitors Center, which is situated between the General Assembly and Secretariat buildings, and can be seen only from FDR Drive or the East River. <b>Just</b> <b>inside</b> the perimeter fence of the complex stands a line of flagpoles where the flags of all 193 UN member states, plus the UN flag, are flown in English alphabetical order.|$|E
5|$|The next ring {{is named}} the Le Verrier ring after Urbain Le Verrier, who {{predicted}} Neptune's position in 1846. With an orbital radius of about 53,200km, it is narrow, with a width of about 113km. Its normal optical depth is 0.0062±0.0015, which corresponds to an equivalent depth of 0.7±0.2km. The dust fraction in the Le Verrier ring ranges from 40% to 70%. The small moon Despina, which orbits <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> {{of it at}} 52,526km, {{may play a role}} in the ring's confinement by acting as a shepherd.|$|E
5|$|A banqueting {{house was}} built <b>just</b> <b>inside</b> the {{south-west}} corner of the moat. Though it was probably built in the 16th century, {{it was in a}} dilapidated state by 1577. A base court (an enclosed area) was added in front of the castle’s gatehouse after the main complex was built, but it unclear when. Wetland areas south and east of the castle may have been used to emulate a mere, a type of broad shallow lake. As well as this, there were two fishponds, but their dating is uncertain. During Wressle Castle’s heyday in the 16th century, the quality of the gardens and ornamental landscape would have paralleled the interior of the renovated buildings, possibly even rivalling gardens at royal properties.|$|E
