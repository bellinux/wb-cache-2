500|$|Hamming {{remained}} at Los Alamos until 1946, when he accepted a {{post at the}} [...] Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL). For the trip to New Jersey, he bought Klaus Fuchs's old car. When he later sold it just weeks before Fuchs was unmasked as a spy, the FBI regarded the timing as suspicious enough to interrogate Hamming. Although Hamming described his role at Los Alamos as being that of a [...] "computer janitor", he saw computer simulations of experiments {{that would have been}} impossible to perform in a laboratory. [...] "And when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> to think about it," [...] he later recalled, [...] "I realized that it meant that science was going to be changed".|$|E
500|$|Both Ruby and Brax decide Charlie's {{ventilator}} {{should be}} turned off as {{there is nothing more}} the doctors can do for her and Charlie dies. Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, I made sure I was in the privacy of my own home. It was written really well – it was a tragic love story and I hope the fans like it." [...] The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer had told her that after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay for another reason and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said [...] "I started sobbing! But that was the initial shock. You play this character {{for three and a half}} years and you really empathise with them. You have to love a part of them – it's a little extension of you. So it's just so final, the death. But once <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> to let it sink in, now I'm really, really happy with the ending. It's very dramatic and it's definitely going out with a bang, so to speak!" [...] Anderson departed on screen on 24 January 2012.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was looking}} {{directly}} at the flash... hardly thicker than my finger ... it passed within two feet of my eyes. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> after the flash to look up {{over the edge of}} the 'rain dodger' we had spread across the top of the basket and note that the bottom of the bag apparently was still intact. Probably it was two or three seconds after the flash before the concussion knocked me unconscious. How high we were, I don't know.When I came to, my head was lying outside the basket, with rain falling on my head. I felt Mortom beside me...|$|E

2500|$|Goodrem {{states that}} [...] "This time around <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> to think 'What kind of song do I {{want to create}} here?'", [...] "I really felt the sky was the limit with this record, you could do {{anything}} in a song. I didn't feel limited at all. There were a lot more options, a lot more paths I could go down, more directions I could choose". Songwriter Guy Chambers had been {{keeping an eye on}} Goodrem's career and was impressed with her vocals and songwriting skills. The two writing together resulted in many of the album's key tracks. [...] "'It's really unusual to work with somebody so talented, young, and brave. Who's not scared to take risks and who has the most emotional voice in pop music", You cannot help but believe every word Delta sings." [...] Chambers states about working with Goodrem. Goodrem stated that Chambers was a classy producer and that he was an inspiration to work with. She felt they had a good connection on a musical level. [...] "There's a definite story in the tracklisting," [...] Goodrem says. [...] "I felt I had to be really honest. Songs that people could still relate to but songs that also confronted issues. This past chapter of my life has been such an intense one and I wanted people to know my thoughts".|$|E
