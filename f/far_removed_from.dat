5|$|The {{concept of}} a gene {{continues}} to be refined as new phenomena are discovered. For example, regulatory regions of a gene can be <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> its coding regions, and coding regions can be split into several exons. Some viruses store their genome in RNA instead of DNA and some gene products are functional non-coding RNAs. Therefore, a broad, modern working definition of a gene is any discrete locus of heritable, genomic sequence which affect an organism's traits by being expressed as a functional product or by regulation of gene expression.|$|E
5|$|Chrysostom and Leontius both {{lived in}} Antioch, {{the site of}} Philip's alleged humiliation and repentance, and wrote in the mid-4th century, one hundred years after the event took place. Shahîd takes this, along {{with the fact that}} Babylas is not named in Eusebius' account, as {{evidence}} of an independent local tradition. This tradition would have been perhaps partially oral in nature, and <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the written accounts in Eusebius' library at Caesarea. Many other historians trace Chrysostom and Leontius' accounts back to Eusebius: Hans Pohlsander counts Chrysostom and Leontius' accounts as later accretions to Eusebius original account, dependent on his Historia for their legendary core; John Gregg holds that this dependent relationship is most probable; and Stein claims all three Greeks as contributors to the same gerüchte.|$|E

5|$|Ecology surged {{in popular}} and {{scientific}} interest during the 1960–1970s environmental movement. There are strong historical and scientific ties between ecology, environmental management, and protection. The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating {{the protection of}} wild places by notable ecologists {{in the history of}} conservation biology, such as Aldo Leopold and Arthur Tansley, have been seen as <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> urban centres where, it is claimed, the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located. Palamar (2008) notes an overshadowing by mainstream environmentalism of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban health ecology (then called euthenics) and brought about changes in environmental legislation. Women such as Ellen Swallow Richards and Julia Lathrop, among others, were precursors to the more popularized environmental movements after the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Historian Ron Chernow is of {{the opinion}} that his frustrations in dealing with {{government}} officials during this conflict led him to advocate the advantages of a strong national government and a vigorous executive agency that could get results; other historians tend to ascribe Washington's position on government to his later American Revolutionary War service. He developed a very negative idea of the value of militia, who seemed too unreliable, too undisciplined, and too short-term compared to regulars. On the other hand, his experience was limited to command of at most 1,000 men and came only in remote frontier conditions that were <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the urban situations that he faced during the Revolution at Boston, New York, Trenton, and Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|In 1221, Jacques de Vitry, Bishop of Acre, {{returned}} from the disastrous Fifth Crusade with good news: King David of India, the son or grandson of Prester John, had mobilized his armies against the Saracens. He had already conquered Persia, then under the Khwarezmian Empire's control, and was moving on towards Baghdad as well. This descendant of the great king who had defeated the Seljuks in 1141 planned to reconquer and rebuild Jerusalem. Controversial Soviet historian and ethnologist Lev Gumilev speculated that the much reduced crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Levant resuscitated this legend {{in order to raise}} Christian hopes and to persuade European monarchs who had lost interest by that time in getting involved in costly crusades in a distant region that was <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> their own states and affairs.|$|E

5|$|Nara period Buddhism was {{dominated}} by six state-controlled sects. They were introduced from the mainland and centred around the ancient capitals in Asuka and Nara. These schools were generally academic in nature, closely connected with the court and represented a doctrine that was <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the daily life of the people. In 804, two Japanese monks Kūkai and Saichō travelled to China; on their return they established Tendai and Shingon Buddhism respectively. Unlike their predecessors both esoteric schools took into account {{the needs of the}} common people. Though their origins lay in China, with time they acquired local Japanese traits. Generally the 9th century was a time when Chinese learning thrived in Japan. Authors produced a wide variety of works in Chinese language, including commentaries and treatises on a variety of subjects.|$|E
5|$|The war to {{the south}} {{influenced}} British policy in Canada, where between 40,000 and 100,000 defeated Loyalists had migrated from the new United States following independence. The 14,000 Loyalists {{who went to the}} Saint John and Saint Croix river valleys, then part of Nova Scotia, felt too <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the provincial government in Halifax, so London split off New Brunswick as a separate colony in 1784. The Constitutional Act of 1791 created the provinces of Upper Canada (mainly English-speaking) and Lower Canada (mainly French-speaking) to defuse tensions between the French and British communities, and implemented governmental systems similar to those employed in Britain, with the intention of asserting imperial authority and not allowing the sort of popular control of government that was perceived to have led to the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a subtropical cyclone, Gabrielle {{was located in}} an area of cooler air to its north, dry air to its south and west, southerly wind shear, and cooler water temperatures along its path. Despite these unfavorable conditions, a curved convective band developed in its northern and western quadrants, and the circulation became better defined. Subsequently, the rainbands in its northeastern quadrant dissipated, leaving the well-defined center <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the convection. By later that day, the circulation began to become more involved with the remaining convection. Based on evidence of a weak warm-core, the system was re-designated as Tropical Storm Gabrielle late on September 8 about 185miles (300km) southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the virtues}} of {{heterodyne}} detection is that the difference frequency is generally <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> spectrally <b>from</b> the potential noises radiated {{during the process of}} generating either the signal or the LO signal, thus the spectral region near the difference frequency may be relatively quiet. Hence, narrow electronic filtering near the difference frequency is highly effective at removing the remaining, generally broadband, noise sources.|$|R
50|$|This {{model has}} been widely criticised within the {{framework}} of both processual archaeology and post-processual archaeology, in which the interpretation of social concerns is paramount, beyond the strict needs of subsistence. Yet such criticisms are from archaeologists with little or no direct experience of obtaining food from nature, and Higgs' deterministic views must be seen in the light of his own lengthy and hard experience of farming, where some of his pastures were at a <b>far</b> <b>remove</b> <b>from</b> his farmhouse, necessitating lengthy and time-wasting journeys from his home. Whatever criticisms are now made against Higgs' view of the human past, his profound legacy remains. He taught archaeologists to look outside the site to its setting, {{in a way that is}} as standard a part of methodology as is the recording of the site stratigraphy.|$|R
5|$|Upon making landfall, the {{tropical}} storm produced strong winds {{over a wide}} area. The strongest winds were reported by a station in San Antonio, Texas, which reported 40mph (65km/h) winds, <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the storm's center; these strong winds were likely due to squalls. Heavy rainfall was also reported, though the rains mainly occurred {{to the east of}} the passing tropical cyclone. Precipitation peaked at 10in (254mm) in Ville Platte, Louisiana. The tropical storm produced three tornadoes over the Southern United States which collecitvely caused $39,000in damage and caused two fatalities. Two of the tornadoes formed in Mississippi while one formed in Louisiana. Several other people were also injured by the tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, {{after the}} closing of his father's estate and sale his father's property, he moved west to {{homestead}} and farm at Manitoba, in the Little Saskatchewan district, near Minnedosa. A few years later, {{he had come to}} the realization that farming was not an efficient means of business for him; his farm had been situated in an area that was so <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> a town that travel to deliver his products had been cumbersome. He then gained employment as a carpenter and builder with the Manitoba and North Western Railway, where he was tasked with building rail bridges and stations. He would later move to Winnipeg where he continued working in his field. He would join the contracting firm of Murray & McDermot, serving as foreman on various projects, including the building of the Manitoba Hotel. After some 13 years, he went to Carberry, Manitoba where he continued contracting, this time also entering the furniture business. In 1902, he would also be involved {{in the construction of the}} Union Bank building there.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Household Management {{has been}} edited, revised and {{enlarged}} several times since Isabella's death {{and is still}} in print as at 2016. Food writers have stated that the subsequent editions of the work were <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> and inferior to the original version. Several cookery writers, including Elizabeth David and Clarissa Dickson Wright, have criticised Isabella's work, particularly her use of other people's recipes. Others, such as the food writer Bee Wilson, consider the censure overstated, and that Beeton and her work should be thought extraordinary and admirable. Her name has become associated with knowledge and authority on Victorian cooking and home management, and the Oxford English Dictionary states that by 1891 the term Mrs Beeton had become used as a generic name for a domestic authority. She is also considered a strong influence in the building or shaping of a middle-class identity of the Victorian era.|$|E

5|$|When Victoria {{ascended the}} throne in 1837, Lehzen enjoyed a {{prominent}} {{position at the}} coronation, and remained at court. Lehzen was installed at Buckingham Palace {{as a sort of}} unofficial private secretary, served as chief liaison for the royal residences, and carried the household keys as a sign of her position; her signature was required for all payments of tradesmen's bills, for instance. At this point, it seems that Lehzen had totally replaced Victoria's mother both in terms of influence and affection; Lehzen's apartments adjoined the queen's, while the Duchess of Kent was installed in a suite of rooms <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> Victoria's. For {{the first few years of}} Victoria's reign, especially before her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840, Lehzen had a very strong influence on the queen's outlook on both politics and personal matters, despite the fact that she did not overtly involve herself in state affairs. Even after the queen's marriage, Lehzen retained the private doorway into the royal bedroom, a source of displeasure for Albert.|$|E
5|$|Architectural styles evolve {{and change}} {{to suit the}} {{requirements}} of each individual client. When in 1746 the Duke of Bedford decided to rebuild Woburn Abbey, he chose the Palladian style for the design, as this was now the most fashionable of the era. He selected architect Henry Flitcroft, a protege of Burlington. Flitcroft's designs, while Palladian in nature, would not be recognised by Palladio himself. The central block is small, only three bays, the temple-like portico is merely suggested, and it is closed. Two great flanking wings containing a vast suite of state rooms replace the walls or colonnades which should have connected to the farm buildings; the farm buildings terminating the structure are elevated in height to match the central block, and given Palladian windows, to ensure they are seen as of Palladian design. This development of the style was to be repeated in countless houses, and town halls in Britain over one hundred years. Falling from favour during the Victorian era, it was revived by Sir Aston Webb for his refacing of Buckingham Palace in 1913. Often the terminating blocks would have blind porticos and pilasters themselves, competing for attention with, or complementing the central block. This was all very <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the designs of Palladio two hundred years earlier.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and <b>far</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E

5000|$|The piece has {{received}} a very positive reception from music critics. Reviewing the world premiere, John von Rhein wrote, [...] "Concerto fantastique is Shapey's biggest work to date, and while I don't think it's his most successful—I much prefer the Shapey of the pungent, concise pieces he has written for his Contemporary Chamber Players—I would not deny the work's sinewy expressiveness or its stubborn refusal to sound like anybody else but Shapey." [...] He added: Shapey's sternly sculpted abstract expressionism stands at a <b>far</b> <b>remove</b> <b>from</b> what most of today's younger composers are doing. It is tough, aggressive, loud, uncompromising in its demands on players and listeners. Yet underneath the concerto's typically knotted textures and ferocious harmonies beats {{the heart of a}} fervent romantic. Shapey is about the only ecstatic visionary still working in serious music; he's a modern-day Icarus who thinks nothing of flying perilously close to the sun every chance he gets.|$|R
