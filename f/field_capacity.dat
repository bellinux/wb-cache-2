Snow groomers are also {{used in conjunction with}} snow cannons, to ensure that the snow produced is spread evenly across the resort. However, snow groomers have a detrimental effect on the environment within the resort. Regular pressure from the grooming vehicle increases the infiltration rate of the soil while decreasing the <b>field</b> <b>capacity.</b> This increases the rate at which water can soak through the soil, making it more prone to erosion.|$|E

500|$|First slope mine {{operations}} began in 1854 southeast of Harrisburg. During the early years, the coal was transported by wagon to local {{homes and businesses}} for heating. Coal Mining became an important industry for the post-Antebellum, now Gilded Age city. The Cairo and Vincennes Railroad was completed in 1872 and provided transportation for coal and the miners who tired away underground. After a series of corporate transactions brought the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad {{into the hands of}} the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Railway around 1890, with Illinois state representative Charles P Skaggs as mayor, Harrisburg evolved into one of the leading coal-mining centers of the Midwest. Harrisburg was a strategic spot on the railroad route with a large hump yard, making it the focal point for the most productive coal field operations. Some of the most profitable coal companies that operated around Harrisburg were Big Creek Coal, Harrisburg Coal and O'Gara Coal. Each one with their own sizable rail yards. O'gara was a Progressive Era coal company owned by Thomas J. O'gara of Chicago. He purchased and annexed 23 privately owned mines in the Harrisburg coal field which equaled [...] of land. The Company based its headquarters in Harrisburg in 1905. O'gara only owned 12 operating mines, all in Saline County, but they had an annual output of 7,000,000 tons. 6,000 men were employed in a <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> and the pay roll disbursement was $150,000 per month.

The amount of water remaining in a soil drained to <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> and the amount that is available are functions of the soil type.

The time required to drain a field from flooded condition for a clay loam that begins at 43% water by weight to a <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> of 22% is six days, whereas a sand loam that is flooded to its maximum of 22% water will take two days to reach <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> of 11% water.

50|$|<b>Field</b> <b>Capacity</b> is {{the amount}} of soil {{moisture}} or water content held in the soil after excess water has drained away and the rate of downward movement has decreased. This usually takes place 2-3 days after rain or irrigation in pervious soils of uniform structure and texture. The physical definition of <b>field</b> <b>capacity</b> (expressed symbolically as θfc) is the bulk water content retained in soil at −33 J/kg (or −0.33 bar) of hydraulic head or suction pressure. The term originated from Israelson and West and Frank Veihmeyer and Arthur Hendrickson.|$|E
