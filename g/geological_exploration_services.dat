30|$|As {{compared}} with the earth ground-penetrating radar, the borehole GPR can obtain more abundant information of deep geological mining resource, so {{it is the most}} effective means to obtain and detect complex geological mining structures. The researches of radar for detecting shallow strata and underground targets have a history of 100  years [13]. According to the radar application environment, <b>geological</b> <b>exploration</b> radar can be divided into airborne ground-penetrating radar, ground or shallow ground tunnel radar, and drill-hole deep-underground type drill-hole radar. From the aspect of technical methods to realize <b>geological</b> <b>exploration,</b> the <b>geological</b> <b>exploration</b> radar can be divided into blasting detection method [14], acoustic wave detection method [15], current detection method (resistance method), ray detection method (X-ray, Y-ray) [16], and electromagnetic wave detection method [17], etc. At present, except the electromagnetic radar method, the detection range of other test methods is very limited, and the detection range reported in the literature does not exceed 176  cm. Electromagnetic wave <b>geological</b> <b>exploration</b> methods are divided into continuous wave detection radar and impulse detection radar. The underground exploration radar based on continuous wave system has the defects of low resolution and short transmission distance. Therefore, the <b>geological</b> <b>exploration</b> radar based on impulse system has become a hot research topic in this field. The borehole logging radar based on impulse system has a wide detection range, high resolution, and relatively low cost and has a broad market demand prospect. Not only that, it also has broad application prospects in many hot application fields such as coal mine water penetration accident detection, through-wall and ground-penetrating radar, geological and seismic disaster prediction, and even mineral resource exploration. The key technologies of the impulse system <b>geological</b> <b>exploration</b> radar mainly include high stability, low trigger jitter electric signal source, Omani-directional, directional ultra-wide band antenna, transmission characteristics of impulse signals in complex media, data processing and imaging of impulse electromagnetic signals, electromagnetic compatibility within the impulse radar system, and electromagnetic matching between the impulse radar and the application environment, etc. Among them, the transmission characteristics of time-domain electromagnetic pulses in complex media [18, 19], the development of directional time-domain antennas, the electromagnetic compatibility of the system, and the matching between the system and the environment are the difficult technologies in the development of impulse <b>geological</b> <b>exploration</b> radar. It is among these key technologies that this paper has done a lot of researches and experiments on signal data processing and imaging and has obtained some good experimental results.|$|R
