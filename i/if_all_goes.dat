The band returned stateside for an American leg of their tour kicked {{off with a}} sold-out, nine-day residency at the Orange Peel in Asheville, North Carolina, on June 23, 2007.

Europe would see the band return on another European leg on August 12, 2007, in Stockholm, Sweden and when the band headlined Reading and Leeds Festivals on the August bank holiday weekend of 2007 in England. The Pumpkins returned in September 2007 to play shows in North America, and continued until mid-November. On January 28, 2008, the band returned to Europe to play shows in the Czech Republic and Austria and playing their first Belfast performance in February. They later went on to perform at London's O2 Arena in England, each show attracted a sell out crowd with the London concert attracting over 20,000 people to the O2.

500|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1924 season, Leyland was recognised in The Times {{as one of the most}} promising young professional batsmen in England; the newspaper's cricket correspondent noted that Leyland [...] "is fully expected, in Yorkshire, to develop into a first-rate left-handed batsman." [...] He continued to improve that season, scoring 1,259 runs at 30.70. In August, he scored his first century in first-class cricket, hitting 133 not out in a drawn game against Lancashire; later in the month, he scored another century. Leyland further improved his record in 1925, hitting 1,572 runs at 40.30. Wisden commented: [...] "Leyland still further increased the big reputation he had made in the previous summer and ought, <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>goes</b> well with him, to attain the highest distinction." [...] By the end of the 1926 season, in which he scored 1,561 runs at 39.02 and hit five centuries, Leyland had established himself as one of the most reliable batsmen in the Yorkshire team.|$|E

While he found Goldberg's narration to be higher quality than in most documentaries of this type, he also felt that it [...] "pales after a while." [...] Scheib praised the film for its cinematography and the depth and quality of coverage of the meerkats, and said their activities [...] "constantly amaze", while noting that {{the film was}} a condensed and embellished version of actual events that did not distort the meerkats' story. The Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project, a sponsorship for the research group studying the meerkats, thought the film was a [...] "heart-touching tribute to Flower, with amazing meerkat, landscape and wildlife footage". Though the group noted that the film changes some details from the life history reports it was based on, they felt the film should be enjoyed rather than analyzed. Common Sense Media reviewer Emily Ashby felt the film was accessible to fans and newcomers to the series; she praised the story's scope and emotional impact, calling it a [...] "captivating journey" [...] that did not avoid depicting the [...] "harsh facts of life in the wild". David Lowe from The Sun found the film to be [...] "charming" [...] and a [...] "fantastic documentary [...] manages to be both educational and incredibly entertaining." ...|$|E
