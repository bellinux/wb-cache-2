40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{described}} how dHF-based cleaning recipes, {{such as the}} Imec-clean, have to be optimized {{in order to have}} a good particle removal performance and at the same time minimize the (re-) deposition of particles. The mechanism behind the deposition and removal of particles an a wafer surface is described in terms of van der Waals and electrostatic interaction forces. It is shown that the <b>first</b> <b>oxidizing</b> step during an 'Imec'-clean can chemically modify particles and hence influence the particle removal efficiency. In order to make the cleaning recipe independent upon this <b>first</b> <b>oxidizing</b> step and obtain an optimal removal for all kinds of particles and substrates, the final rinse step has to be optimized. This is achieved by rinsing at a low py where the electrostatic attraction forces are shielded, and in combination with megasonic irradiation to overcome the van der Waals attraction that otherwise will cause the particles to re-deposit. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|This enzyme can {{be induced}} in many Candida yeast strains by growing them on {{long-chain}} alkanes {{as the major}} food source. Long-chain fatty alcohol oxidases participate in omega-oxidation of long chain alkanes or fatty acids.

It is also produced from arginine as a byproduct of the reaction catalyzed by NOS family (NOS; EC 1.14.13.39).

5000|$|... 2,5-Diaminotoluene is a {{substitute}} for phenylenediamine (1,4-diaminobenzene) in commercial hair dyes. It is preferred because of its lower toxicity. However, many home hair dyes still use phenylenediamine.

30|$|Phosphoserine is an {{intermediate}} {{in the production}} of serine through the glycolytic pathway: 3 -phosphoglycerate is <b>first</b> <b>oxidized</b> to form 3 -phosphohydroxypyruvate, which is then transaminated to form phosphoserine. Subsequently, through the action of the enzyme phosphoserine phosphatase, phosphoserine is converted to serine (de Koning et al. 2003; Bender 2012). Plasma serine is then involved in a tight balance with glycine, and the two AAs are interconvertible, which is in agreement with the close correlation found in our study between serine and glycine (r[*]=[*] 0.79, p[*]<[*] 0.001).|$|R
50|$|A common {{example of}} a {{commercial}} biosensor is the blood glucose biosensor, which uses the enzyme glucose oxidase to break blood glucose down. In doing so it <b>first</b> <b>oxidizes</b> glucose and uses two electrons to reduce the FAD (a component of the enzyme) to FADH2. This in turn is oxidized by the electrode {{in a number of}} steps. The resulting current {{is a measure of the}} concentration of glucose. In this case, the electrode is the transducer and the enzyme is the biologically active component.|$|R
50|$|From (+)-sabinene (8), the {{proposed}} biosynthetic route to generate thujone follows a three-step pathway: (+)-sabinene is <b>first</b> <b>oxidized</b> to an isomer of (+)-sabinol (9-1,2) by a cytochrome P450 enzyme, followed by conversion to (+)-sabinone (10) via a dehydrogenase. Finally, a reductase mediates the conversion to α-thujone (11-1) and β-thujone (11-2). The isomerism of the (+)-sabinol intermediate varies among thujone-producing plants; for instance, {{in the western}} redcedar (Thuja plicata), thujone is derived exclusively from the (+)-trans-sabinol intermediate (9-1) whereas in the common garden sage (Salvia officinalis), thujone is formed from the (+)-cis-sabinol intermediate (9-2).|$|R

NH 3 is <b>first</b> <b>oxidized</b> to NH 2 OH by TS- 1 /H 2 O 2; then, CH 3 CH=NOH forms after NH 2 OH reacts with CH 3 CHO.

For example, hydrogen peroxide together with 4 amino-antipyrene (4-AAP) and phenol {{in the presence of}} peroxidase yield a red quinoeimine dye that can be measured at 505 nm. The absorbance at 505 nm is proportional to concentration of glucose in the sample.|$|R

The process is continued until the cell potential reaches a level where the decomposition of the electrolyte is possible at about 1.55 volts. This is taken {{as the end of}} a charge, as no further charge is stored, and any oxygen which might be generated poses a mechanical and fire hazard to the cell.|$|R

50|$|To {{regenerate}} {{the original}} ground state, the catalyst must {{participate in a}} second outer-sphere electron transfer. In many cases, this electron transfer takes place with a stoichiometric two-electron reductant or oxidant, although in some cases this step involves a second reagent. The case where the excited state catalyst is first reduced and then oxidized to return to its resting state {{is known as a}} reductive quenching cycle. Conversely, the case where the excited state catalyst is <b>first</b> <b>oxidized</b> and then reduced to return to its resting state is known as an oxidative quenching cycle.

25|$|Epinephrine is {{synthesized}} in the medulla of the {{adrenal gland}} in an enzymatic pathway that converts the amino acid tyrosine {{into a series of}} intermediates and, ultimately, epinephrine. Tyrosine is <b>first</b> <b>oxidized</b> to L-DOPA, which is subsequently decarboxylated to give dopamine. Oxidation gives norepinephrine. The final step in epinephrine biosynthesis is the methylation of the primary amine of norepinephrine. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) which utilizes S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) as the methyl donor. While PNMT is found primarily in the cytosol of the endocrine cells of the adrenal medulla (also known as chromaffin cells), it has been detected at low levels in both the heart and brain.|$|R
