25|$|The arm {{movements}} of the front crawl provide most of the forward motion. The arms alternate from side to side, so while one arm <b>is</b> <b>pulling</b> and pushing under the water, the other arm is recovering above the water.

500|$|The crisis also {{prompted}} the Ministry of Foreign Affairs {{to reduce its}} foreign aid to developing nations, from 0.31% to 0.27% of GNP. [...] The effect of the aid cut was greatly amplified by the falling value of the króna: {{the budget of the}} Icelandic International Development Agency (ICEIDA) was reduced from US$22 million to $13 million. [...] Since Iceland's foreign aid is targeted in sectors for which the country has particular expertise (e.g., fisheries, geothermal power), the cutbacks will have a substantial impact in countries which receive Icelandic aid – most noticeably in Sri Lanka, where ICEIDA <b>is</b> <b>pulling</b> out altogether.|$|E

500|$|Kate [...] (Evangeline Lilly) is {{awakened by}} an Australian farmer, Ray Mullen (Nick Tate), as she sleeps in his barn. She {{introduces}} herself as Annie, a backpacking graduate, and Mullen offers her {{a job on}} the farm. When she later leaves the farm, Ray offers {{to give her a}} ride to the train station. On the way Kate notices a black car following them, and Ray reveals he learned Kate was a fugitive, and decided to deliver her to the authorities for the reward money. As soon as they are approached by the tailgating car, driven by US Marshal Edward Mars (Fredric Lane), Kate jerks the wheel and causes Ray's vehicle to crash off the road. As Kate <b>is</b> <b>pulling</b> Ray from the burning vehicle, Marshall Mars captures her at gunpoint.|$|E
500|$|Forces {{act in a}} {{particular}} direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is. Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as [...] "vector quantities". This means that forces follow {{a different set of}} mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted scalar quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result. If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person <b>is</b> <b>pulling,</b> it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction. In this simple one-dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other. Associating forces with vectors avoids such problems.|$|E
50|$|Another {{noteworthy}} event {{occurred in}} November 1965, when, {{for the last}} time, the North train <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> by a steam engine. It was the last passenger train in the North Island to <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> by a steam locomotive.|$|R
25|$|Iver Johnson made {{an unusual}} model from 1940 to 1947, called the Trigger Cocking Double Action. If the hammer <b>was</b> down, <b>pulling</b> the trigger would cock the hammer. If the trigger <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> with the hammer cocked, it would then fire. This meant that {{to fire the}} {{revolver}} from a hammer down state, the trigger must <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> twice.|$|R

500|$|Much of {{the extra}} local {{stretching}} in Death Valley {{that is responsible for}} its lower depth and wider valley floor is caused [...] by left lateral strike-slip movement along the Garlock Fault south of the park (the Garlock Fault separates the Sierra Nevada range from the Mojave Desert). This particular fault <b>is</b> <b>pulling</b> the Panamint Range westward, causing the Death Valley graben to slip downward along the Furnace Creek Fault system {{at the foot of the}} Black Mountains. The rocks that would become the Panamint Range may have been stacked on top of the rocks that would become the Black Mountains and the Cottonwood Mountains. Under this interpretation, as the Black Mountains began to rise, the Panamint/Cottonwood Mountains slid westward off of them along low-angle normal faults, and starting around 6 Ma, the Cottonwood Mountains slid northwest off the top of the Panamint Range. There is also some evidence that the Grapevine Mountains may have slid off the Funeral Mountains. Another interpretation of the evidence is that the Black and Panamint Mountains were once side-by-side and were pulled apart along normal faults. These normal faults, in this view, are steep near the surface but become low angle at depth; the mountain blocks rotated as they slid to create the tilted mountains seen today.|$|E
500|$|Jim (John Krasinski) deduces {{over the}} course of the day that Michael is leaving early and confronts him about it. Michael admits his plans, and begins a {{personal}} goodbye, but breaks down after a few words. Jim, trying to hold back tears, in turn says how much he respects Michael, and that Michael was the best boss he ever had and they jokingly promise to have a proper goodbye over lunch the next day. Michael's cab to the airport then arrives, and Michael departs the office after one last look at the employees, exiting silently. His cab pulls out of the parking lot just as Pam <b>is</b> <b>pulling</b> in. At the airport, Michael asks the camera crew to inform him if the documentary ever airs, then turns over his microphone, quipping one last [...] "That's what she said" [...] about how good it will feel to [...] "get this thing [...] off [...] chest". He begins to walk off when Pam makes it past security and runs up to him. They hug twice and say goodbyes that are not heard by the camera. Pam says in an interview that Michael was not sad, that he was hopeful and excited to start his new life with Holly. Pam stands at the gate and watches Michael's plane take off.|$|E
