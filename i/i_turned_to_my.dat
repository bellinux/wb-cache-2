500|$|Baywatch and Knight Rider star David Hasselhoff {{accepted}} the role when his daughters, Taylor-Ann and Hayley, urged him: [...] "I got {{an offer to}} do a cameo in the SpongeBob Movie and <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> girls, who were like 16 and 14, and I said, 'Who's SpongeBob?' and they said, 'Oh my God, Dad, it's the number one cartoon in the world, you gotta do it.'" [...] Hasselhoff enjoyed his cameo: [...] "It was great fun {{and to this day}} around the world kids stop me and say, 'Are you David Hasselhoff?' because I was the only human in the picture." [...] Hasselhoff said that the film gained him new fans: [...] "It's amazing - so many of the kids were so young and didn't see Baywatch and Knight Rider so I got a whole new legion of fans." ...|$|E
500|$|The Heroes of the Lance are {{the protagonists}} of the Chronicles trilogy, the first series of Dragonlance books. They {{were created by}} Weis and Hickman, then fleshed out as player {{characters}} in gaming sessions of Dungeons & Dragons at Hickman's apartment. One player at this initial gaming session was game designer Terry Phillips, who was playing as Raistlin. According to Hickman in the foreword to The Soulforge, [...] " [...] were just settling in to the game when <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> good friend Terry Phillips and asked what his character was doing. Terry spoke...and the world of Krynn was forever changed. His rasping voice, his sarcasm and bitterness all masking an arrogance and power that never needed to be stated suddenly were real. Everyone {{in the room was}} both transfixed and terrified. To this day Margaret [...] swears that Terry wore the black robes to the party that night." ...|$|E
60|$|Still repeating this word, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> pillow; {{and still}} repeating it, I steeped that pillow with tears.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> {{botanist}} almost reprovingly. [...] "You know, she won't {{be quite}} the same lady here that you knew in Frognal," [...] I say, and wrest myself from a subject {{that is no longer}} agreeable by rising <b>to</b> <b>my</b> feet.|$|R
60|$|He went reluctantly {{into the}} house, and <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> again <b>to</b> <b>my</b> audience.|$|R
40|$|My {{comment on}} Jeffrey Gordon 2 ̆ 7 s paper is in two parts: I first suggestwhy this symposium, whose {{purpose is to}} define the {{contours}} of amandatory corporation law, attempts to answer the wrong question. Thereafter, <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> assigned task and address directly the explanationsGordon develops for the mandatory structure of corporate law...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> letters. One {{was from}} Lickford, with a Cornish postmark. I glanced {{through it and}} laid it aside for a more {{exhaustive}} perusal.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is my choice," [...] I declared. [...] "Right here we take root. This {{shall be}} the Garland Homestead." [...] <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> father. [...] "When can you move?" ...|$|E
60|$|I frowned. It {{seemed to}} me the affair had now gone much too far. Lord Porthoning had {{staggered}} to a chair and was sitting there with his face buried in his hands. He was a stricken man. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> father-in-law.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> meet <b>my</b> new foe it {{was with}} a heart {{considerably}} lightened.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> speak <b>my</b> {{first words}} of {{comfort to the}} mother. The cry of the child stopped me.|$|R
60|$|But {{now that}} chance was gone, and as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> two companions I felt utterly nonplussed.|$|R
6000|$|We were {{beginning}} to descend. In the distance below us already twinkled {{the lights in the}} solitary rancho of Lone Valley. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> companion. [...] "But you have forgotten that I don't even know your name. What am I to call you?" ...|$|E
60|$|I felt {{proud to}} know that the liberties of Massachusetts and of our {{fatherland}} were in such safe keeping; and as <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> hoeing again I was filled with an inexpressible confidence, and pursued my labor cheerfully with a calm trust in the future.|$|E
60|$|So he spoke, pronouncing in {{his strong}} Scotch accent the most {{carefully}} selected English I had ever heard. A hard-headed, square-shouldered, pertinaciously self-willed man--it was plainly useless {{to contend with}} him. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mother's gentle face for encouragement; and I let my doctor have his own way.|$|E
30|$|Having {{established}} that (yi)-ge heads an nP {{and takes the}} secondary predicate as its complement in a SGC, <b>I</b> now <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> analysis of TAc in the construction.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> said, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> uncle, [...] "under the {{testimony}} {{that can be}} offered, and am surprised to hear you suggest a doubt of {{the result of the}} trial." ...|$|R
6000|$|I walked {{rapidly to}} the gate. When {{challenged}} by the sentinel, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> summon <b>my</b> instructor. He was nowhere visible: desolate and forbidding, as about the broken statue of Ozymandias, ...|$|R
6000|$|It was a cold, dead morning (the sun {{not being}} up yet), and when I had out-watched the paling {{light of the}} fires of the iron country, and the curtain of heavy smoke that hung at once {{between me and the}} stars and between me and the day, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> fellow-traveller and said: ...|$|E
60|$|Having {{completed}} my {{survey of}} the horizon, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> more immediate surroundings. My {{first thought was that}} a man who had come through a collision and rubbed shoulders with death merited more attention than I received. Beyond a sailor at the wheel who stared curiously {{across the top of the}} cabin, I attracted no notice whatever.|$|E
6000|$|Quite involuntarily, when I {{had thought}} of my portmanteau, I had flung up the left arm (fingers fully extended) and {{clutched}} at my diaphragm with my right hand. I am an acutely self-conscious man at all times. The gesture struck me as absolutely novel for me. I repeated it, for my own satisfaction. [...] "Odd!" [...] Then (rather puzzled) <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> portmanteau.|$|E
6000|$|... "Which they {{certainly}} will do," [...] <b>I</b> continued. <b>Turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> wife and Aunt Martha, [...] "As {{you have heard}} this fine story, I think {{it is time for}} you to retire." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{do you say}} to all this, Miss Warren," [...] <b>I</b> asked, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> companion, for by {{some secret}} {{influence}} I was walking at her side. [...] "Are you 'up canopy' or 'down canopy'?" ...|$|R
40|$|I am {{delighted to}} speak to you as a {{representative}} of the Association for Humanist Sociology. It is <b>my</b> purpose today <b>to</b> acquaint you with the Association for Humanist Sociology, to prompt your queries about the Association, and to answer your questions concerning the ways in which our organization supports the humanist values and professional interests of students and practicing sociologists across the country. Prior to talking about the “nuts and bolts” of the Association’s history and member services, however, <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> central topic for today: a socioautobiographical perspective on what it means to be a humanist sociologist...|$|R
60|$|She had {{the true}} Jacobus impudence, that old woman. Her mop of iron-grey hair was parted, {{on the side}} like a man's, raffishly, and she made as if to plunge her fork into it, as she used {{to do with the}} knitting-needle, but refrained. Her little black eyes sparkled venomously. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> host {{at the head of the}} table-- menacingly as it were.|$|E
60|$|It was in {{this period}} of doubt and disheartenment that <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> little {{daughter}} with gratitude and {{a deep sense of}} the mystery of her coming. The never-ending surprise of her presence filled me with delight. Like billions of other Daddies I forgot my worries as I looked into her tranquil eyes. To protect and educate her seemed at the moment my chiefest care.|$|E
60|$|And then at my next {{movement}} something squealed sharply. I turned about, but I {{could not}} see it, only I saw a little stir in a rut and heard the diminishing rustle of the unseen creature's flight. And at that <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> toad again, and its eye moved and it stirred. And presently, with infirm and hesitating gestures, it stretched its limbs and began to crawl away from me.|$|E
6000|$|Cleon [raising and {{clasping}} Ion to his breast]. Here, on my heart, dear one. <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> meet <b>my</b> executioners, and see thee, my boy. Great Heaven, I bless thee! [They embrace tenderly and weep.] Thou camest thither--how? ...|$|R
60|$|I walked {{rapidly to}} the gate. When {{challenged}} by the sentinel, <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> summon <b>my</b> instructor. He was nowhere visible. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> again <b>to</b> look at the prison. Nothing was there: desolate and forbidding, as about the broken statue of Ozymandias.|$|R
60|$|At length <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> resume <b>my</b> clothes. And {{since it}} must excite comment and perhaps arouse {{suspicion}} were I {{to appear in}} any but my jester's garish livery, I once more assumed my foliated cape, my cap and bells.|$|R
6000|$|The Idiots {{is such an}} {{obviously}} derivative piece of work {{that it is impossible}} for me to say anything about it here. The suggestion of it was not mental but visual: the actual idiots. It was after an interval of long groping amongst vague impulses and hesitations which ended in the production of [...] "The Nigger" [...] that <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> third short story in the order of time, the first in this volume: Karain: A Memory.|$|E
6000|$|By degrees I got {{interested}} in my book, so interested that presently I was startled by its dropping out of my hands. I looked and saw that Jacob was still asleep, and I was rejoiced {{to see that there}} was on his face a look of unwonted happiness, while his lips seemed to move with unspoken words. Then <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> work again, and again woke, but this time to feel chilled to my very marrow by hearing the voice from the bed beside me: ...|$|E
6000|$|The janitor {{took the}} {{manuscript}} and disappeared. <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> desk again {{and was soon}} absorbed in arranging a full-page display of plumbers' furnishings for the advertising. It had {{occurred to me that}} by arranging the picture matter in a neat device with verses from [...] "Home Sweet Home" [...] running through it in double-leaded old English type, I could set up a page that would be the delight of all business readers and make this number of the magazine a conspicuous success. My mind was so absorbed that I scarcely noticed that over an hour elapsed before the janitor returned.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mistress O'Halloran," [...] {{the doctor}} said, rising {{and making a}} deep bow, [...] "you {{overwhelm}} me, entirely; and now I must say goodnight, for I must look in at the hospital, before <b>I</b> <b>turn</b> in <b>to</b> <b>my</b> quarters." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> thank <b>my</b> preserver, whose table adjoined mine. He was a Frenchman, a melancholy-looking man. He had the {{appearance}} of one who has searched for the leak in life's gas-pipe with a lighted candle; of one whom the clenched fist of Fate has smitten beneath the temperamental third waistcoat-button.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I {{never saw}} him more. Immediately {{afterwards}} <b>I</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> rejoin <b>my</b> companions, whom I soon overtook, and entered our village along with them. I {{was regarded as a}} poor warrior, because I brought home no scalps, and ever afterwards I went by the name of Redfeather in our tribe." ...|$|R
