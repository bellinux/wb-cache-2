5|$|Dumbo, in {{production}} during {{the midst of}} the animators' strike, premiered in October 1941 and proved to be a financial success. The simple film only cost $950,000 to produce, <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, {{less than a third of}} the cost of Pinocchio, and two-fifths of the cost of Fantasia. Dumbo eventually grossed $1.6 million during its original release. In August 1942, Bambi was released, and as with Pinocchio and Fantasia, did not perform well at the box office. Out of its $1.7 million budget, it only grossed $1.64 million.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the show, Fox network {{officials}} forced the staff of The Simpsons to produce clip shows in order to save money. Originally, the producers were ordered to produce four clip show per season in order to meet episode limits imposed by the network. Fox network officials reasoned that clip shows could be produced at <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> a normal episode, but syndication rights could be sold at full price. The staff, however, felt such a large number of clip shows would alienate fans of the series.|$|E
5|$|Kirov was {{completely}} overhauled from 1949 to 1953. Her secondary armament was upgraded with electrically powered, fully automated 100mm B-34USM mountings and her fire-control system {{was replaced with}} a Zenit-26 system with SPN-500 stabilized directors. All of her light AA guns were replaced with nine twin gun water-cooled 37mm V-11 mounts. All of her radars were replaced with Soviet systems: Rif surface search, Gyuys air search, Zalp surface gunnery and Yakor' anti-aircraft gunnery radars. All anti-submarine weapons, torpedo launchers, aircraft equipment and boat cranes were removed. While expensive, about <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> a new Project 68bis , it was deemed a success and allowed Kirov to serve for another two decades.|$|E

5|$|The {{steam turbine}} {{section of a}} power plant, the turbine hall, {{generally}} costs about $1/W, and the electrical equipment to feed that power to the grid is about another $1/W. To reach the projected total CAPEX quoted in LIFE documents, this implies that the entire nuclear island has to cost around $4/W for LIFE.2, and just over $2/W for LIFE.3. Modern nuclear plants, benefiting from decades of commercial experience and continuous design work, cost just under $8/W, with approximately half {{of that in the}} nuclear island. LLNL's estimates require LIFE.3 to be built in 2040 for about <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> a fission plant today.|$|E
5|$|Almost immediately, {{the company}} began looking at the {{possibility}} of converting {{all or part of the}} system into railways. W A Povis, their engineer, was convinced that railways could be built along the routes at around <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> building a new line. The move was opposed by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal who argued that closing bits of the inland waterways system would have serious repercussions on the parts left. Robert Stephenson suggested that a number of railways and canals should amalgamate, to reduce competition when bills were presented to Parliament. The canals to join the Ellesmere and Chester Company were the eastern and western branches of the Montgomeryshire Canal, the Shrewsbury Canal and the Shropshire Canal. Although some would be converted to railways, the route from Ellesmere Port to Middlewich via Barbridge Junction was part of the system that would be retained as a waterway, on which salt was a major source of revenue. The plans resulted in the formation of the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company in 1846. The new company could raise £3.3 million of new capital, in addition to that already in existence, with another £1.1 million if necessary. They prompted new railways, but before any of the existing canals were converted, the company was leased to the London and North Western Railway, who took control in June 1847. They allowed the Shropshire Union to continue to operate fairly independently, and by 1849, the idea of conversion had been dropped, as the canals could still operate profitably.|$|E

25|$|A major {{technological}} advance was {{the design of}} the Dutch merchant ship known as the fluyt. Unlike rivals, it was not built for possible conversion in wartime to a warship, so it was cheaper to build and carried twice the cargo, and could be handled by a smaller crew. Construction by specialized shipyards using new tools made it <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> rival ships. The factors combined to sharply lower the cost of transportation for Dutch merchants, giving them a major competitive advantage.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{settlement}} of Alta California {{was the last}} colonization project to expand Spain's vastly over-extended empire in North America, {{and they tried to}} do it with minimal cost and support. Approximately <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> settling Alta California was borne by donations and half by funds from the Spanish crown. Massive Indian revolts in New Mexico's Pueblo Revolt among the Pueblo Indians of the Rio Grande valley in the 1680s as well as Pima Indian Revolt in 1751 and the ongoing Seri conflicts in Sonora Mexico provided the Franciscan friars with arguments to establish missions with fewer colonial settlers. In particular, the sexual exploitation of Native American women by Spanish soldiers sparked violent reprisals from the Native community and the spread of venereal disease.|$|E
25|$|The Gophers officially {{moved back}} onto campus, to TCF Bank Stadium, for the 2009 {{football}} season. The University believed an on-campus stadium would motivate its student base for increased ticket sales, and also {{would benefit from}} athletic revenues, {{not only for the}} football program, but the non-revenue sports as well. The new stadium reportedly cost less than half of a current-era NFL-style football stadium, and was built on what were former surface parking lots just a few blocks east of the former Memorial Stadium, with the naming rights purchased by TCF Bank. The University of Minnesota expected to raise more than <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the stadium via private donations. The Gopher Stadium bill was passed by both houses on May 20, 2006, the day before the Twins Stadium bill passed.

25|$|Later that year, Representative Barnes Compton (D-Maryland) {{introduced}} legislation in Congress {{to build a}} $60,000 bridge of wood on wooden piers. But the Compton bill was strongly opposed by the D.C. Commissioners. The legislation required that the city pay <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the structure, and Commissioner Samuel E. Wheatley led the city government in adamantly refusing to support the bill. A group of EWCA members began personally lobbying Congress for the bridge. Samuel Taylor Suit, a state senator in the Maryland legislature, won passage of a resolution by that state supporting the bridge. These efforts proved highly successful. Senator Blackburn and Representative Rowell won a $40,000 increase in the amount appropriated for the bridge, and inserted language into the bill requiring that it be constructed of iron and be set on stone piers. This legislation passed both chambers of Congress unanimously on February 23, 1887.|$|E

These terms were accepted by Rhodes and his colleagues, of whom W. P. Schreiner was one, and a protest was sent by Chamberlain stating that the government regarded the closing of the drifts as a breach of the London Convention, and as an unfriendly action that called for the gravest of responses. President Kruger reopened the drifts at once, and stated that he would issue no further directives on the subject except after consultation with the imperial government.|$|E
25|$|Residents of Massachusetts {{must have}} health {{insurance}} coverage under Chapter 58.

The Connector waiver can be obtained if the resident demonstrates {{that there is no}} available coverage that is defined by the Connector as affordable. In March 2007, the Connector adopted an affordability schedule that allows residents to seek a waiver. If a resident does not have coverage and does not have a waiver, the Department of Revenue will enforce the insurance requirement by imposing a penalty. In 2007, the penalty was the loss of the personal exemption. Beginning in 2008, the penalty is <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the lowest available yearly premium which will be enforced as an assessed addition to the individual's income tax.|$|E

25|$|Salt {{was one of}} {{the first}} exports from West Virginia. By 1828 sixty-five wells along the Kanawha River {{produced}} 787,000 bushels of salt per year, and by 1835 the industry used the labor of nearly 3,000 men, mostly slaves. Much of Charleston's growth was a result of this resource. By 1852 a yearly fleet of 400 flatboats moved three million bushels of salt to markets south and midwest. The growth of the salt industry also resulted in exploitation of lumber, coal and gas resources, with increased use of slave labor. By 1860, however, salt production was in decline, with only 14 wells located in the counties of Kanawha, Mason, Marion and Mercer. Kanawha County wells used 63% of all male and 29% of all female slaves in the county. Slaves could be hired for <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> free workers, and required less supervision. Living conditions for the slaves were unsanitary, and outbreaks of cholera often occurred. In 1844 one hundred slaves died over a three-month period from cholera. The actual number of slaves in the Kanwaha Valley exceeded the stated census numbers due to the shifting population of hired slaves in the salt industry.|$|E

Hatfield's Progressive Conservative Party was reelected in that fall's general election, despite misgivings of the nuclear generation plan by part of the population. In March 1975, Hatfield declared on television that the decision was final, and that the reactor would be built regardless of the ongoing environmental assessment process, in a move described by New Brunswick sociologist Ronald Babin as the [...] "nuclear fait accompli policy".|$|R
