The BBC {{announced that it}} would not broadcast [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] due to the line [...] "I'd love to turn you on", which, according to the corporation, advocated drug use. Other lyrics allegedly referring to drugs include [...] "found my way upstairs and had a smoke / somebody spoke and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> dream". A spokesman for the BBC stated: [...] "We have listened to this song over and over again. And we have decided that it appears to go just a little too far, and could encourage a permissive attitude to drug-taking." [...] The ban was eventually lifted on 13 March 1972.|$|E
