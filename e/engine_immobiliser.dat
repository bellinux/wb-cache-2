25|$|In July 1995, the facelifted {{model was}} {{launched}} in Australia, although this differed to the update applied to the North American variants. The update brought a new grille, slight updates to the rear end, new hubcaps, a lighter interior colour scheme with a new range of fabrics, and the discontinuation of the Ultima trim. Equipment wise, a new security system was fitted with remote central locking, <b>engine</b> <b>immobiliser</b> and alarm. The CSi gained four-wheel disc brakes, and optional anti-lock brakes. Seat belt webbing clamps for the front seats were now fitted as was a lap-sash belt in the centre rear. Climate control air-conditioning for the CS-X, an improved stereo system, {{and the addition of}} cup holders also featured.|$|E
2500|$|A perimetric (and {{optional}} volumetric) alarm, <b>engine</b> <b>immobiliser</b> and remote-control {{central locking}} with deadbolts are standard equipment on the 75. Alloy wheels are fitted with locking wheel nuts. Automatic locking when driving off is standard, {{but can be}} disabled by a dealer. On the inside is a master locking switch and the boot can only be opened by remote control or an interior button. [...] A battery back-up sounder and tracking device called Trackstar were available as options.|$|E

50|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} the Mahindra Centuro is a Central Locking Anti Theft System with <b>Engine</b> <b>Immobiliser</b> and multifunctional (car-like) flip key with 96-bit encryption, something that is first {{not just in the}} segment but a first for all motorcycles made in India.This encryption key invented by Mr.Anik Majumdar. He is a young genius from konnagar, District : Hooghly, West Bengal, India. He had made lots of inventions in his home laboratory, named Holuni.|$|E

50|$|The Executive was {{the entry}} level model that featured: power steering, four-speaker sound system, power mirrors, remote boot and fuel filler release, central locking and an <b>engine</b> <b>immobiliser.</b> The Altera model, {{which was a}} mid-entry level model, added: air-conditioning, power windows and cruise control. Options included: airbags for driver and passenger, ABS, a CD player and alloy wheels. Subsequent {{additions}} to the model range included the Advance (safety-package) and the Altera LS (mid-luxury package), which featured ABS, airbags, CD player and alloy wheels as standard.|$|E
5000|$|As of the 1994 model year, {{a limited}} edition model, known as Europa, was {{introduced}} on the European market. It could be ordered {{both as a}} saloon and an Avant. It was factory-equipped with power mirrors, alloy wheels, rear seat headrests, an airbag steering wheel, and offered a choice between power sunroof or air conditioning. It came in five different special colours. For [...] "regular" [...] 1994 B4 saloons and Avants, standard features as well as options available were stepped up too, including an airbag steering wheel and redesigned door liners (standard), and passenger airbags and a built-in <b>engine</b> <b>immobiliser</b> (optional).|$|E
5000|$|The VTR {{also has}} a [...] engine, whereas the VTS, the premium sports model, has a [...] engine capable of {{accelerating}} from 0 to 60 mi/h km/h in 8.0 seconds, seen as sluggish by modern hot hatch standards where the fastest contemporary hot hatch achieved 5.3 seconds (Clio V6), although this {{is designed to be}} more insurance friendly. Other additions which helped the VTS model achieve a low insurance rating (in the United Kingdom) were security based including deadlocks and a Thatcham Category 1 alarm system which includes perimeter and volumetric detection as well as an <b>engine</b> <b>immobiliser.</b>|$|E
50|$|A simpler {{version of}} the smart key system is the <b>engine</b> <b>immobiliser,</b> {{involving}} a security key system embedded into most modern vehicle's keys. A small chip rests on the vehicle's key or under the plastic key cover. When any key is inserted into the ignition, the ignition is coded. The key sends its security code to the ignition, which also has its own security code, and if the security codes match, the vehicle will start when the key is turned. However, if the key codes do NOT match, the vehicle will NOT start when the key is turned. Some early examples of this technology include Chrysler Corporation's Sentry Key System, or General Motors's PASSKey System.|$|E

50|$|The Honda CBR600F4 was {{produced}} between 1999 and 2000. It {{is the last}} of the CBR600 series of Honda sportbikes to be carbureted. An aluminium twin spar frame which reduced frame weight was used, and the engine crankcase was designed to share swing-arm pivot. Through a reduction of internal friction and weight, combined with larger valves, shorter stroke, and a bigger bore, higher revs were enabled. The spark plug caps had Ignition coils built into them. Slightly larger carbs were added and the oil cooler was now located by the oil filter. A new suspension had larger 43 mm forks and used Fireblade parts. The front brakes were upgraded, and the rear rim increased to 5.5” with new 3-spoke wheels. The F4 was fitted with Honda’s HISS <b>engine</b> <b>immobiliser</b> system.|$|E

40|$|Technological {{innovation}} in Automotive Electronics {{has led to}} the development of Engine Immobilisers. The present day <b>Engine</b> <b>Immobiliser</b> based on Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) are growing unsafe as professional hackers have been able to break into them. In 2005, a group of students in the Johns Hopkins University, USA hacked an RFID <b>Engine</b> <b>Immobiliser</b> and stole the vehicle in under twenty minutes. It is disturbing that almost a decade later the field of Engine Immobilisers has seen very little advancement. As a result the number of vehicle theft cases has risen exponentially in the past decade globally. The need of the hour is to design a system which enhances the security of the vehicle removing the drawbacks of the existing RFID system. We propose a system which replaces the prevalent technology with a Face Recognition System. Additionally, the system gives the owner remote access to the vehicle’s ignition system further reducing chances of vehicle theft. Measures are also taken to enhance passenger safety. Ease of operation is supplemented through a Keyless Entry module...|$|E
40|$|We provide {{evidence}} for a beneficial welfare impact of a policy targeted at strengthening victim precaution. Regulation made application of the electronic <b>engine</b> <b>immobiliser</b> mandatory for all new cars sold within the European Union. We exploit the regulation as source of exogenous variation in use of the anti-theft device. The device reduced car theft by an estimated 40 %, accounting for both the protective effect on cars with the device and the displacement effect on cars without the device. 34 cars need to be fitted with the device (at a per unit cost of 50 euros) to avert one theft...|$|E
40|$|Motor vehicle {{security}} has improved considerably {{in the past}} decade, both in Australia and other developed countries, and from July 2001 all new passenger vehicles sold in Australia were required to be fitted with an Australian Standard (AS) <b>engine</b> <b>immobiliser</b> prior to sale. Although little formal evaluation {{of the effect of}} engine immobilisers has been undertaken, Brown & Thomas (2003) investigated the effect of a similar initiative introduced in the European Union in 1998. They found that in the United Kingdom immobilisers were effective in reducing vehicle theft rates, but also that there was some evidence of displacement in thefts toward older, non-immobilised vehicles. This study replicates the method of Brown & Thomas using Australian data from the National CARS (Comprehensive Auto-theft Research System) Project to determine whether the same pattern in theft trends has occurred in Australia. This study compares the calendar years 2000 and 2004 in terms of theft rates, the proportion of late model vehicles fitted with AS immobilisers, and the age distributions of stolen vehicles (both recovered and not recovered) in order to look for any changes in the theft profile that may be attributed to improved new car security...|$|E
