50|$|The urban {{environment}} can also increase diversity {{in a number}} of ways. Many foreign organisms are introduced and dispersed naturally or artificially in urban areas. Artificial introductions may be intentional, where organisms have some form of human use, or accidental, where organisms attach themselves to transportation vehicles. Humans provide food sources (e.g. birdfeeder seeds, trash, <b>garden</b> <b>compost)</b> and reduce the numbers of large natural predators in {{urban environment}}s, allowing large populations to be supported where food and predation would normally limit the population size. There are a variety of different habitats available within the urban environment as a result of differences in land use allowing for more species to be supported than by more uniform habitats.|$|E

The application of enzymatic bioactivators Ekoline into deep litter in pig breeding and subscequent technical and technological processing of the final product is solved. The measurements were carried out in two stalls. In one of them (Stall A), Ekoline was applied. It was placed in the deep litter. The temperature of the litter and air, and the concentration of ammoniac were measured. The temperature of the litter with Ekoline was higher by 10 oC on average during the whole monitoring. The temperature of air in both the stalls was almost identical: 22, 6 oC on average in Stall A, and 22, 8 oC on average in Stall B. The concentration of ammoniac (NH 3) in the air was 17, 9 ppm in Stall A and 243, 4 ppm in Stall B. A technology of composting on heaps for the stabilisation of fermented litter is suggested in the present thesis. This technology will be in compliance with a Czech standard CSN 465735 Prumyslove komposty. The existing objects that are secured against leaks will be used. A wheel loader is suggested as the most suitable equipment for this technology.

40|$|International audienceReversible bioelectrodes were {{designed}} by alternating acetate and oxygen supply. It was demonstrated that the protons produced and accumulated inside the biofilm during the anodic phase greatly favored the oxygen reduction reaction when the electrode was switched to become the biocathode.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{composition}} and properties of a biomixture {{used in a}} biobed are decisive for pesticide sorption and degradation. This study was performed to investigate the capability of compost-based substrates in mixtures with citrus peel and vine branch straw and peat-based substrates in mixtures with soil and vine branch straw at different levels in order to degrade isoproturon and bentazone. RESULTS: Dissipation and mineralisation rates of both pesticides were determined, and metabolic activity was followed as respiration. Compost-based substrates showed faster pesticide dissipation {{in the presence of}} lignocellulosic materials, as in <b>garden</b> <b>compost</b> and vine branch straw. The increasing content of vine branch straw in peat-based substrates does not seem to affect dissipation of the parent compounds. Low mineralisation rate was observed in all treatments. CONCLUSION: Higher pesticide degradation was observed in the lignocellulosic substrates, probably because of the development of lignin-degrading microorganisms which have shown to be robust and are able to degrade recalcitrant pesticides...|$|E

40|$|<b>Garden</b> <b>compost</b> {{has already}} been {{identified}} as a source of efficient electro-active (EA) biofilms. The work described here consisted of lixiviating the compost and then using the leachate as a microbial source. This procedure gave promising results for the treatment of yogurt waste (YW) in a microbial fuel cell (MFC). Experiments performed in MFC set-ups were compared with electrochemical cells under polarization at + 0. 1 V versus SCE. Different parameters were tested to optimize the microbial anode. Preliminary acclimation of the compost microbial flora to YW was revealed to be unnecessary. Forming biofilms firstly in pure leachate before exposing them to YW showed that high concentrations of this type of substrate were detrimental to current generation. Pre-treatment of the electrode by pre-adsorbing YW led to a 10 -fold increase in the current density. The highest current densities were obtained at 40 and 60 ¬∞C, revealing the diversity of electro-active microorganisms coming from soils. Values up to 1, 450 mA m‚àí 2 were reached at 40 ¬∞C...|$|E
40|$|<b>Garden</b> <b>compost</b> {{leachate}} {{was used}} to form microbial bioanodes under polarization at 0. 4, 0. 2 and + 0. 1 V/SCE. Current densities were 6. 3 and 8. 9 A m 2 on average at 0. 4 and + 0. 1 V/SCE respectively, with acetate 10 mM. The catalytic cyclic voltammetry (CV) showed similar electrochemical characteristics for all bioanodes and indicated that the lower currents recorded at 0. 4 V/SCE were due to the slower interfacial electron transfer rate at this potential, consistently with conventional electrochemical kinetics. RNA- and DNA-based DGGE evidenced that the three dominant bacterial groups Geobacter, Anaerophaga and Pelobacter were identical for all bioanodes and did {{not depend on the}} polarization potential. Only non-turnover CVs showed differences in the redox equipment of the biofilms, the highest potential promoting multiple electron transfer pathways.

40|$|SUMMARY: The use of methane-oxidizing biocovers to {{minimize}} methane emissions {{to the atmosphere}} is being examined in an ongoing field study at the Leon County Landfill (Florida, USA).
