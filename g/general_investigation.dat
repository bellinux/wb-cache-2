Development continued into the 1920s, after which Mg-based biomaterials fell out of <b>general</b> <b>investigation</b> due to their poor performance (likely due to impurities in the alloys drastically increasing corrosion). It {{was not until the}} late 1990s that interest started to pick up again, spurred by the availability of ultra-high purity Mg, which significantly increases its longevity inside the body.|$|E

25|$|Bereft {{of further}} combat {{replacements}} for his hard-pressed Marauder battalions, Stilwell {{felt he had}} no choice but to continue offensive operations with his existing forces, using the Marauders as 'the point of the spear' until they had either achieved all their objectives, or were wiped out. He was also concerned that pulling out the Marauders, the only U.S. ground unit in the campaign, resulted in charges of favoritism, forcing him to evacuate the exhausted Chinese and British Chindit forces as well. When General William Slim, commander of British and Commonwealth forces in Burma, informed Stilwell that his men were exhausted and should be withdrawn, Stilwell rejected the idea, insisting that his subordinate commanders simply did not understand enlisted men and their tendency to magnify physical challenges. Having made his own 'long march' out of Burma under his own power using jungle trails, Stilwell found it difficult to sympathize with those who had been in combat in the jungle for months on end without relief. In retrospect, his statements at the time revealed a lack of understanding of the limitations of lightly equipped unconventional forces when used in conventional roles. Myitkyina and the dispute over evacuation policy precipitated a hurried Army Inspector <b>General</b> <b>investigation,</b> followed by U.S. congressional committee hearings, though no disciplinary measures were taken against General Stilwell for his decisions as overall commander.|$|E

2500|$|The {{role of the}} Central Intelligence Agency in {{the killing}} has been debated. Imbert insists that the {{plotters}} acted on their own. In {{a report to the}} Deputy Attorney General of the United States, CIA officials described the agency as having [...] "no active part" [...] in the assassination and only a [...] "faint connection" [...] with the groups that planned the killing. An internal CIA memorandum states that a 1973 Office of Inspector <b>General</b> <b>investigation</b> into Trujillo's murder disclosed [...] "quite extensive Agency involvement with the plotters." [...] The weapons of the assassins included three M1 carbines that had been supplied with the approval of the CIA. President John F.

2500|$|On March 2, 2013, {{two more}} controversies welled up at a city council hearing. The first {{was more than}} $97,000 in {{overtime}} payments to 10 DCFEMS mechanics in fiscal 2012. Ellerbe blamed front-line managers, who allowed too many workers to take leave and then approved too much overtime. He promised new protocoals to ensure it did not recur. The second were accusations of sexual harassment made by two female cadets at the DCFEMS fire training academy against male colleagues. Ellerbe said management [...] "reacted quickly" [...] to the incident, but committee on public safety chair Tommy Wells asked for a D.C. inspector <b>general</b> <b>investigation.</b> Ellerbe spent part of his testimony at the hearing discussing much improved ambulance response times. But a week later, on March 9, Ellerbe was forced to admit that ambulance response times were poor.|$|E
2500|$|In {{their final}} mission, the Marauders {{suffered}} 272 killed, 955 wounded, and 980 evacuated for illness and disease; some men later died from cerebral malaria, amoebic dysentery, and/or scrub typhus. [...] Somewhat ironically, Marauders evacuated {{from the front}} lines were given jungle hammocks with protective sandfly netting and rain covers in which to sleep, equipment which might have prevented various diseases and illnesses had they been issued earlier in the campaign. [...] The casualties included General Merrill himself, who had suffered a second heart attack before going down with malaria. He was replaced by his second-in-command, Colonel Charles N. Hunter, who later prepared a scathing report on General Stilwell's medical evacuation policies (eventually prompting an Army Inspector <b>General</b> <b>investigation</b> and congressional hearings). [...] By the time the town of Myitkyina was taken, only about 200 surviving members of the original Marauders were present. A week after Myitkyina fell, on 10 August 1944, the 5307th was disbanded with a final total of 130 combat-effective officers and men (out of the original 2,997). Of the 2,750 to enter Burma, only two were left alive who had never been hospitalized with wounds or major illness. None of the horses and only 41 mules survived.|$|E

2500|$|The New York Attorney General is {{investigating}} whether ExxonMobil's statements to investors {{were consistent with}} the company’s decades of extensive scientific research. The Martin Act in New York state law gives the state Attorney General broad powers to investigate financial fraud. On November 4, 2015 the New York Attorney General issued a subpoena to ExxonMobil. The New York Attorney <b>General</b> <b>investigation</b> includes possible violations of consumer protection, fraud, and securities law. ExxonMobil denied withholding climate change research. Following published reports, based on internal Exxon documents, suggesting that during the 1980s and 1990s Exxon used climate research in its business planning but simultaneously argued publicly that the science was unsettled, the California Attorney General {{is investigating}} whether ExxonMobil lied to the public or shareholders about the risk to its business from climate change, possible securities fraud, and violations of environmental laws. ExxonMobil denied wrongdoing. On March 29, 2016, the attorneys general of Massachusetts and the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) announced investigations. Seventeen attorneys general were cooperating on investigations. Exxon said the investigations were [...] "politically motivated." [...] As of June 2016, ExxonMobil is suing the Attorneys General of USVI (Claude Walker) and Massachusetts (Maura Healey, who had issued supoenas of their own).|$|E
