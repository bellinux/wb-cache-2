Did you know that nearly all sick people have eaten carrots? Obviously, the effects are cumulative. An estimated 99. 9 per-cent of people who die from cancer and heart disease have eaten car-rots. Of all people involved in car crashes, 99. 9 percent ate carrots within sixty days of their accidents. Also, 93. 1 percent of juvenile delinquents come from homes where carrots are served regularly. Among the people born in 1839 who later ate carrots there has been a 100 percent mortality rate (Hope Healthletter, 1992, p. 1) Now, those of you who ate carrots last night for dinner should be feeling pretty uneasy, except for one fact.

25|$|Flying faster {{means that}} the {{aircraft}} passes through the range of a gun more rapidly, {{reducing the number of}} rounds a particular gun can fire at that aircraft. Flying at higher altitudes has a similar effect, as it requires larger shells to reach those altitudes, and this typically results in slower firing rates for a variety of practical reasons. Aircraft using jet engines basically double the speed and altitude of conventional designs, so limiting the number of shells that the chance of hitting the bomber essentially dropped to zero. As early as 1942, German flak commanders were <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem, and expecting to face jet bombers, they began a missile development program to supplant their guns.|$|E

Hopkins was <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's need for medical facilities, particularly in light of the medical advances made during the war, and in 1870 he made a will setting aside seven million dollars — mostly in B stock — for the incorporation of a free hospital and affiliated medical and nurse's training colleges, as well as an orphanage for colored children and a university. Many board members were on both boards. The hospital and orphan asylum would each be overseen by the 12-member hospital board of trustees, and the university by the 12-member university board of trustees. Johns Hopkins' bequest was used to posthumously found the Johns Hopkins Colored Children Orphan Asylum first as he requested, in 1875; the Johns Hopkins University in 1876; the Johns Hopkins Press, the longest continuously operating academic press in America, in 1878; the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing in 1889; the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine 1893; and the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1916.|$|E

Knowing that he would need to reprieve many of the 'economic collaborators'—such as police and civil servants who held minor roles under Vichy {{in order to keep the}} country running as normally as possible—he assumed, as head of state, the right to commute death sentences. Of the near 2,000 people who received the death sentence from the courts, fewer than 800 were executed. De Gaulle commuted 998 of the 1,554 capital sentences submitted before him, including all those involving women. Many others were given jail terms or had their voting rights and other legal privileges taken away. It is generally agreed that the purges were conducted arbitrarily, with often absurdly severe or overly lenient punishments being handed down. It was also notable that the less well-off people who were unable to pay for lawyers were more harshly treated. As time went by and feelings grew less intense, a number of people who had held fairly senior positions under the Vichy government—such as Maurice Papon and René Bousquet—escaped consequences by claiming to have worked secretly for the resistance or to have played a double game, working for the good of France by serving the established order.|$|E

As the group that developed Protégé, {{the most widely used}} ontology editor, we are <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> how difficult <b>the</b> users perceive this task to be. In this paper, we present <b>the</b> new version <b>of</b> WebProtégé that we designed with two main goals in mind: (1) create a tool that will be easy to use while still accounting for commonly used OWL constructs; (2) support collaboration and social interaction around distributed ontology editing as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core tool design. We designed this new version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WebProtégé user interface empirically, by analysing <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> OWL constructs in a large corpus of publicly available ontologies. Since <b>the</b> beta release <b>of</b> this new WebProtégé interface in January 2013, our users from around the world have created and uploaded 519 ontologies on our server. In this paper, we describe <b>the</b> key features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new tool and our empirical design approach. We evaluate language coverage in WebProtégé by assessing how well it covers the OWL constructs that are present in ontologies that users have uploaded to WebProtégé. We evaluate <b>the</b> usability <b>of</b> WebProtégé through a usability survey. Our analysis validates our empirical design, suggests additional language constructors to explore, and demonstrates that an easy-to-use web-based tool that covers most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frequently used OWL constructs is sufficient for many users to start editing their ontologies. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} concerns <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> renewal on <b>the</b> German Left. How did {{crises of}} renewal and moments of generational conflict shape {{the theory and}} organization of German socialism during the tumultuous four decades between 1930 and 1970 ? When and how did socialism cease {{to be a viable}} political alternative to democratic capitalism? I treat <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> one small organization, New Beginning, as paradigmatic for <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> socialist renewers generation—the generation that renewed socialism through antifascist struggle and remade the German Left after the war. Born between 1905 and 1915, the renewers were too young to have served in the First World War or actively participated in the November Revolution. They matured amid the political and economic turmoil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Weimar Republic and later pioneered <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> “socialist splinter groups. ” Between <b>the</b> fronts <b>of</b> social democracy and communism, these small organizations like New Beginning, the Socialist Workers’ Party (SAP), the International Socialist Fighting League (ISK), and the Communist Party-Opposition (KPO) sought to unify and renew the German socialist movement through a curious combination of elite vanguardism and grassroots initiative. They believed that the fight against fascism provided socialists a unique opportunity to finish the democratic revolution that had begun as early as 1848, leapt forward in 1918 - 19, but stalled during the conservative Weimar Republic. New Beginning distinguished itself from the other splinter groups in the way it explicitly articulated <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> socialist renewal and linked <b>the</b> fate <b>of</b> socialism to <b>the</b> fate <b>of</b> its own generation. After twelve years of anti-Nazi resistance and war, former members of New Beginning such as Fritz Erler, Waldemar von Knoeringen, Richard Löwenthal, Wolfgang Abendroth, Ossip K. Flechtheim, and Robert Havemann either arose from the rubble or returned from exile to acquire leading posts in German academia and politics. They set about applying the theories and methods they had learned during the 1930 s to <b>the</b> new problems <b>of</b> reconstruction, divided Germany, and the developing Cold War. <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> renewers generation helped modernize the Social Democratic Party and develop a new kind of socialism that renounced Marxism and embraced a liberal, middle-class ethos. An important minority of renewers, however, stayed true to <b>the</b> promise <b>of</b> radical socialism. These dissident left socialists paved the way toward a New Left, and in the 1960 s the original revolutionary élan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> renewers passed on to a new generation of militant young intellectuals: the Sixty-eighters. Political ideologies as well as mass social movements grow old. Their proponents and participants physically age, and their ideas start to rust. Revival and rejuvenation, then, periodically capture the attention and shape <b>the</b> objectives <b>of</b> multi-generational social movements. <b>The</b> former members <b>of</b> New Beginning were <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> renewal could cause dysfunction in <b>the</b> established parties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Left. But they also recognized an opportunity to mobilize the German youth against capitalism and conservative reaction. Instead of restarting socialism, however, the New Left and the Sixty-eighters unwittingly extinguished <b>the</b> original promise <b>of</b> German socialism and the renewers generation. Subsequent movements for social change in Germany and elsewhere in Europe would occur largely outside the socialist tradition...|$|R

[...] Loudoun encountered opposition in the General Court (the provincial assembly) to a demand that British troops be billeted with civilians in Boston, and threatened to march additional troops into the province and take housing by force. [...] Pownall requested that the General Court accede in some way to Loudoun's demands, eventually signing a bill authorizing the quartering of troops in inns and other public spaces. [...] This bill was unpopular, and Pownall was negatively cast in the local press as supportive of Loudoun and his policies. [...] Pownall's exchanges with Loudoun, however, show that he was <b>keenly</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonists' position: [...] "the inhabitants of this province are intitled to the natural rights of English born subjects ... the enjoyment of these rights ... will animate and encourage them to resist ... a cruel, invading enemy".
