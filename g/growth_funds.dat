5000|$|The firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers (KPCB) {{was formed}} in 1972 on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California, {{with a focus on}} seed, early-stage, and growth investments. The firm is named after its four {{founding}} partners: Eugene Kleiner, Tom Perkins, Frank J. Caufield, and Brook Byers. Kleiner and Perkins came from technology industry backgrounds; Kleiner was a founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Perkins was an early Hewlett-Packard executive. Byers joined in 1977. [...] Located in Menlo Park, California, Kleiner Perkins had access to the growing technology industries in the area. By the early 1970s, there were many semiconductor companies based in the Santa Clara Valley as well as early computer firms using their devices and programming and service companies. Venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in 1974, when the stock market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund. Nevertheless, Kleiner Perkins was still active in this period. By 1996, Kleiner Perkins had handed out $880 million in funding to around 260 companies. Beyond the original founders, notable members of the firm include or have included individuals such as John Doerr, Vinod Khosla, and Bill Joy.Colin Powell joined as a “strategic” partner in 2005, while Al Gore joined as partner in 2007 [...] as part of a collaboration between Kleiner Perkins and Generation Investment Management. Mary Meeker joined the firm in 2010, and that year Kleiner Perkins expanded its practice to invest in growth stage companies. The New York Times has described Kleiner Perkins as “perhaps Silicon Valley’s most famous venture firm.” The firm was described by Dealbook in 2009 as [...] "one of Silicon Valley’s top venture capital providers,” and The Wall Street Journal in 2010 called it one of the [...] "largest and most established" [...] venture capital firms. In May 2012, Ellen Pao, an employee, sued the firm for gender discrimination in Pao v. Kleiner Perkins, which Kleiner Perkins has vigorously denied. On March 27, 2015, after a month-long trial, the jury found against Pao on all claims. In June 2015, Pao filed an appeal. [...] In September 2015, Pao announced she would no longer appeal the jury verdict. By 2017 Kleiner Perkins had raised around $10 billion in 20 venture capital funds and four <b>growth</b> <b>funds.</b>|$|E

We further report substantial variation in the amount of risk-taking, and local and international stock market exposure of KiwiSaver <b>Growth</b> <b>funds,</b> making it meaningless to compare these funds simply based on their returns. Using risk-adjusted performance metrics, we observe {{there is no evidence of}} systematic outperformance of KiwiSaver <b>Growth</b> <b>funds,</b> and in several cases there is evidence of systematic underperformance.
