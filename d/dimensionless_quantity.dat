25|$|This {{question}} considers three variables: distance D, time T, {{and velocity}} V. These variables admit {{a basis of}} two dimensions: time T and distance D. Thus there is 32=1 <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantity.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{permittivity}} of a {{dielectric medium}} is often {{represented by the}} ratio of its absolute permittivity to the electric constant. This <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantity</b> is called the medium’s relative permittivity (εr) or dielectric constant (κ).|$|E
25|$|The Reynolds {{number is}} a <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantity</b> which characterises the {{magnitude}} of inertial effects compared to {{the magnitude of}} viscous effects. A low Reynolds number (Re<<1) indicates that viscous forces are very strong compared to inertial forces. In such cases, inertial forces are sometimes neglected; this flow regime is called Stokes or creeping flow.|$|E

40|$|The {{arguments}} for regarding the number 1 {{as a unit}} of the SI are reviewed. Examples of <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantities</b> are presented, and problems associated with representing the values of <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantities</b> of very small magnitude are discussed. The logarithmic ratio units bel, decibel and neper are discussed. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{numerical}} {{factors are}} there to simplify the equations of motion. The goal is to understand the statistical fluctuations. Like any other non-quadratic path integral, the correlation functions have a Feynman expansion as particles travelling along random walks, splitting and rejoining at vertices. The interaction strength is parametrized by the classically <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantity</b> λ.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{aforementioned}} situation with distance, the scale of angles is the same in pure mathematics, physics, and computing. It {{does not depend on}} the scale of distances; all distances may be multiplied by some fixed factor, and all angles will be preserved. Usually, the angle is considered a <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantity,</b> but there are different units of measurement, such as radian (preferred in pure mathematics and theoretical physics) and degree (°) (preferred in most applications).|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used method of calculation is that originally proposed by Linus Pauling. This gives a <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantity,</b> {{commonly referred to as}} the Pauling scale (χr), on a relative scale running from around 0.7 to 3.98 (hydrogen= 2.20). When other methods of calculation are used, it is conventional (although not obligatory) to quote the results on a scale that covers the same range of numerical values: this is known as an electronegativity in Pauling units.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the {{cumbersome}} {{nature of}} expressing certain <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantities</b> per SI guidelines, the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) in 1999 proposed {{the adoption of}} the special name [...] "uno" [...] (symbol: U) to represent the number 1 in <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantities.</b> This symbol is {{not to be confused with}} the always-italicized symbol for the variable [...] "uncertainty" [...] (symbol: U). This unit name [...] "uno" [...] and its symbol could be used in combination with the SI prefixes to express the values of <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantities</b> that are much less—or even greater—than one.|$|R

25|$|In nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy (NMR), chemical shift is usually expressed in ppm. It represents the difference of a measured frequency in parts per million from the reference frequency. The reference frequency depends on the instrument's magnetic field and the element being measured. It is usually expressed in MHz. Typical chemical shifts are rarely {{more than a few}} hundred Hz from the reference frequency, so chemical shifts are conveniently expressed in ppm (Hz/MHz). Parts-per notation gives a <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantity</b> that does not depend on the instrument's field strength.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{does not}} have the units of angular {{momentum}} and is not a type of spin, the formalism that describes it is mathematically similar to that of angular momentum in quantum mechanics, which means it can be coupled in the same manner. For example, a proton-neutron pair can be coupled in a state of total isospin 1 or 0. It is a <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantity</b> and the name derives {{from the fact that the}} mathematical structures used to describe it are very similar to those used to describe the intrinsic angular momentum (spin).|$|E
25|$|In {{each case}} an {{equilibrium}} constant {{can be specified}} as a quotient of activities. This equilibrium constant is dimensionless as activity is a <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantity.</b> However, use of activities is very inconvenient, so the equilibrium constant is usually divided by the quotient of activity coefficients, to become a quotient of concentrations. See equilibrium chemistry#Equilibrium constant for details. Moreover, the concentration of solvent is usually taken to be constant and so is also subsumed into the equilibrium constant. For these reasons, the constant for a solubility equilibrium has dimensions related to the scale on which concentrations are measured. Solubility constants {{defined in terms of}} concentrations are not only temperature dependent, but also may depend on solvent composition when the solvent contains also species other than those derived from the solute.|$|E

It is given by α≈, which is approximately equal to [...]|$|E
500|$|Previous {{definitions}} of chemical quantity involved Avogadro's number, a historical term {{closely related to}} the Avogadro constant, but defined differently: Avogadro's number was initially defined by Jean Baptiste Perrin as the number of atoms in one gram-molecule of atomic hydrogen, meaning one gram of hydrogen. This number is also known as Loschmidt constant in German literature. The constant was later redefined as the number of atoms in 12 grams of the isotope carbon-12 (12C), and still later generalized to relate amounts of a substance to their molecular weight. [...] For instance, to a first approximation, 1 gram of hydrogen element (H), having the atomic (mass) number 1, has [...] hydrogen atoms. Similarly, 12 grams of 12C, with the mass number 12 (atomic number 6), has the same number of carbon atoms, [...] [...] Avogadro's number is a <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantity,</b> and has the same numerical value of the Avogadro constant when given in base units. In contrast, the Avogadro constant has the dimension of reciprocal amount of substance. The Avogadro constant can also be expressed as , which can be used to convert from volume per molecule in cubic ångströms to molar volume in millilitres per mole.|$|E
5000|$|Similitude is {{the theory}} and art of {{predicting}} prototype (original object) performance from scale model observations. The main requirement of similitude is all <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantities</b> must be equal for both the scaled model and the prototype under the conditions the modeler desires to make observations. <b>Dimensionless</b> <b>quantities</b> are generally referred to as Pi terms, or π terms. In many fields the π terms are well established.

[...] Thus, for a scale model test to be reliable, the Reynolds number, {{as well as all}} other important <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantities,</b> must be equal for both scale model and prototype under the conditions that the modeler wants to observe.|$|R

5000|$|In {{convective}} heat transfer, the Churchill-Bernstein equation {{is used to}} estimate the surface averaged Nusselt number for a cylinder in cross flow at various velocities. [...] The need for the equation arises from the inability to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in the turbulent flow regime, even for a Newtonian fluid. When the concentration and temperature profiles are independent of one another, the mass-heat transfer analogy can be employed.

2500|$|When {{faced with}} a case where {{dimensional}} analysis rejects a variable ( [...] , here) that one intuitively expects to belong in a physical description of the situation, {{another possibility is that}} the rejected variable is in fact relevant, but that some other relevant variable has been omitted, which might combine with the rejected variable to form a <b>dimensionless</b> <b>quantity.</b> That is, however, not the case here.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, {{a report}} to the International Committee for Weights and Measures (known also by its French-language {{initials}} CIPM) stated that response to the proposal of the uno [...] "had been almost entirely negative" [...] and the principal proponent [...] "recommended dropping the idea".
