5|$|Following the shooting, American and {{international}} politicians expressed grief and condemnations. Gun control advocates pushed for increased {{restrictions on the}} sale of firearms and ammunition, specifically <b>high-capacity</b> ammunition magazines. Some commentators criticized the use of harsh political rhetoric in the United States, with a number blaming the political right wing for the shooting; in particular, Sarah Palin was criticized for a poster by her political action committee that featured stylized crosshairs on an electoral map. Palin rejected claims that she bore responsibility for the shooting, and others defended her by noting that Loughner hated all politicians regardless of their affiliation. President Barack Obama led a nationally televised memorial service on January 12, and other memorials took place.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} Airbus began {{development}} of the A300B9, a larger derivative of the A300, which would eventually become the A330. The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful turbofan engines available. It was targeted at the growing demand for <b>high-capacity,</b> medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes. Offering the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 but with 25 per cent more fuel efficiency, the B9 {{was seen as a}} viable replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijets. It was also considered as a medium-ranged successor to the A300.|$|E
5|$|The Terrestrial Trunked Radio {{network has}} three {{components:}} the core net, {{which is a}} centralized computer center based on an Internet Protocol structure; the transmission net, which connects the core net, the radio net and other connection points with <b>high-capacity</b> lines; and the radio net, which consists of base stations with antennas in masts, on buildings and in some tunnels. The network is controlled by Motorola. In case a base station no longer can communicate with the core net, the base station can still relay communication within its range. Should the base station fall out or operations occur in areas without coverage, the terminals can communicate directly with each other.|$|E
5|$|While {{these six}} {{aircraft}} provided a limited tanker capability suitable for refuelling fighters, the Mk 20A wing hosereels could only deliver fuel at a limited rate, {{and were not}} suitable for refuelling bombers. Work therefore continued to produce a definitive three-point tanker conversion of the Victor Mk.1. Fourteen further B.1A and 11 B.1 were fitted with two permanently fitted fuel tanks in the bomb bay, and a <b>high-capacity</b> Mk 17 centreline hose dispenser unit with three times the fuel flow rate as the wing reels, and were designated K.1A and K.1 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Responding to {{requests}} from Japanese airlines for a <b>high-capacity</b> aircraft to serve domestic routes between major cities, Boeing developed the 747SR as a short-range {{version of the}} 747-100 with lower fuel capacity and greater payload capability. With increased economy class seating, up to 498 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models. The 747SR had an economic design life objective of 52,000 flights during 20 years of operation, compared to 24,600 flights in 20 years for the standard 747. The initial 747SR model, the -100SR, had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the added stress accumulated from {{a greater number of}} takeoffs and landings. Extra structural support was built into the wings, fuselage, and the landing gear along with a 20 percent reduction in fuel capacity.|$|E
5|$|Swissair {{placed the}} first order for the 747-300 on June 11, 1980. The variant revived the 747-300 designation, which had been {{previously}} used on a design study that did not reach production. The 747-300 first flew on October 5, 1982, and the type's first delivery went to Swissair on March 23, 1983. Besides the passenger model, two other versions (-300M, -300SR) were produced. The 747-300M features cargo capacity on the rear portion of the main deck, similar to the -200M, but with the stretched upper deck it can carry more passengers. The 747-300SR, a short range, <b>high-capacity</b> domestic model, was produced for Japanese markets with a maximum seating for 584. No production freighter version of the 747-300 was built, but Boeing began modifications of used passenger -300 models into freighters in 2000.|$|E
5|$|When {{the heated}} and air {{conditioned}} McDonald's Cycle Center opened, bicycle parking facilities with amenities, which had {{first appeared in}} the U.S. on the West Coast, did not exist in the Midwest. When it opened in 2006 the bike station was one of the country's largest and most modern. The Cycle Center's bicycle parking facilities use <b>high-capacity,</b> two-tiered DoubleParker racks that accommodate {{more than twice as many}} bicycles per square foot as traditional bike racks. These racks were manufactured by Josta, a German manufacturer of bicycle parking systems and stands. The interior design was a joint collaboration between the city of Chicago, Josta, and Cycle-Safe, Inc. of Grand Rapids, Michigan, which also produces lockers and racks for bicycles. The Chicago Park District runs the station, which has a full-time staff.|$|E
25|$|Additionally a rapid {{separation}} {{approach was}} published in the Journal of Chromatography A in 2007. The process uses <b>high-capacity</b> high-speed countercurrent chromatography (<b>high-capacity</b> HSCCC). Through this method honokiol can be separated and purified to above 98% purity with a high yield in under an hour.|$|E

25|$|Sydney Metro is {{currently}} under construction. It will be Australia's first full-fledged <b>high-capacity</b> rapid transit system, {{as opposed to}} other networks (i.e. Sydney Trains, Metro Trains Melbourne and Transperth trains) which operate as partially rapid transit.|$|E
25|$|Since 2012, Tbilisi has a modern, <b>high-capacity</b> gondola lift which {{operates}} between Rike Park and the Narikala fortress; each gondola can carry up to 8 persons. The system {{was built by}} the Italian manufacturer Leitner ropeways.|$|E
25|$|On 4 July 2009, {{with the}} opening of the Neihu Line, the last of the six {{original}} lines was completed. Due to controversy on whether to construct a medium-capacity or <b>high-capacity</b> line, construction of the line did not begin until 2002.|$|E
25|$|On October 7, 2013, Time Warner Cable {{announced}} that it has agreed to acquire DukeNet Communications LLC for $600 million. DukeNet provides data and <b>high-capacity</b> bandwidth services to wireless carrier, data center, government, and enterprise customers in the Southeast.|$|E
25|$|A Chinese Arms manufacturer, Norinco, exports a clone of the M1911A1 for {{civilian}} purchase as the M1911A1 and the <b>high-capacity</b> NP-30, as well 9mm variants the NP-28 and NP-29. China has also manufactured conversion kits to chamber the 7.62×25mm Tokarev round following the Korean War.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of {{dynamic random-access memory}} (DRAM) technology by Robert Dennard at IBM in 1967 {{made it possible to}} fabricate single-transistor memory cells, and the {{invention of}} flash memory by Fujio Masuoka at Toshiba in the 1980s led to low-cost, <b>high-capacity</b> memory in diverse electronic products.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{mixtures}} {{are commonly}} used in HVAC and industrial heating or cooling systems as a <b>high-capacity</b> heat transfer medium. Many formulations have corrosion inhibitors, and {{it is expected that}} these chemicals will be replenished (manually or under automatic control) to keep expensive piping and equipment from corroding.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the first}} MRT line in the network to use fully {{automated}} and driverless trains, and is also the world's first fully automated and driverless <b>high-capacity</b> rapid transit line to use conventional steel-wheel technology (as opposed to the rubber-tired, medium-capacity technology found in systems like VAL).|$|E
25|$|DM {{were the}} only Yellowstones to have a <b>high-capacity</b> {{pedestal}} or centipede tender, and had roller bearings on all axles. Some of the locomotives had a cylindrical Elesco feedwater heater ahead of the smoke stack, while others had a Worthington unit with its rectangular box in the same location.|$|E
25|$|From late 1943 and 1944, RNZAF P-40s were {{increasingly}} used against ground targets, including the innovative use of naval depth charges as improvised <b>high-capacity</b> bombs. The last front line RNZAF P-40s {{were replaced by}} Vought F4U Corsairs in 1944. The P-40s were relegated to use as advanced pilot trainers.|$|E

25|$|To {{complement}} the company's two previous high-speed cartridge-based console generations, Nintendo had already developed <b>high-capacity</b> secondary storage {{devices such as}} the Famicom Disk System and the cancelled SNES-CD. The company had always intended to do likewise with this generation. In a 1994 interview, Nintendo summarized its analysis of the continued advantages of cartridges for its upcoming console, eventually known as the Nintendo 64.|$|E
25|$|Some {{deterioration}} {{occurs on}} each charge–discharge cycle. Degradation usually occurs because electrolyte migrates {{away from the}} electrodes or because active material detaches from the electrodes. Low-capacity NiMH batteries (1,700–2,000mA·h) can be charged some 1,000 times, whereas <b>high-capacity</b> NiMH batteries (above 2,500mA·h) last about 500 cycles. NiCd batteries tend to be rated for 1,000 cycles before their internal resistance permanently increases beyond usable values.|$|E
25|$|On 27 March 2013, Public Transport Victoria {{published}} a document, detailing a 4-stage plan {{spread over the}} next 20 years to slowly redevelop Melbourne's rail network into that of a 'metro-style' network, by separating train lines and creating point-to-point lines, upgrading to <b>high-capacity</b> signalling and the order of new trains, to allow Melbourne's train network to operate like that of most metro systems around the world.|$|E
25|$|Another major recommendation, {{which was}} {{addressed}} in the second Romney-Obama debate, is the banning of assault weapons. The ban, originally signed in 1994 and expired in 2004, stopped the sale of assault weapons, armor-piercing rounds, and <b>high-capacity</b> magazines to civilians. Senator Feinstein believes the ban should be resigned, not only to stop violence in Mexico and California, but to decrease the amount of gun violence in California, and across America.|$|E
25|$|Audio tape {{cassettes}} and <b>high-capacity</b> floppy disks (e.g., Imation SuperDisk), {{and other}} forms of drives with removable magnetic media, such as the Iomega Zip and Jaz drives, are now largely obsolete and rarely used. There are products in today's market that will emulate these legacy drives for both tape and disk (SCSI1/SCSI2, SASI, Magneto optic, Ricoh ZIP, Jaz, IBM3590/ Fujitsu 3490E and Bernoulli for example) in state-of-the-art Compact Flash storage devices – CF2SCSI.|$|E
25|$|OC Transpo of Ottawa, Ontario, {{purchased}} three transit-type Enviro500s in 2008 {{as part of}} {{a one-year}} pilot project to investigate the use of double-deckers on <b>high-capacity</b> routes. Numbered from 1201 to 1203, they were operated on a variety of routes, but their height, which exceeded the requirements of the MTO, made them impractical for continued use. These three demo buses were sold to BC Transit in the summer of 2012 (see above).|$|E
25|$|A {{supercapacitor}} (SC) (also electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC), {{also called}} supercap, ultracapacitor or Goldcap) is a <b>high-capacity</b> capacitor with capacitance values {{much higher than}} other capacitors (but lower voltage limits) that {{bridge the gap between}} electrolytic capacitors and rechargeable batteries. They typically store 10 to 100 times more energy per unit volume or mass than electrolytic capacitors, can accept and deliver charge much faster than batteries, and tolerate many more charge and discharge cycles than rechargeable batteries.|$|E
25|$|English {{inventor}} Thomas Parker, who {{was responsible}} for innovations such as electrifying the London Underground, overhead tramways in Liverpool and Birmingham, and the smokeless fuel coalite, built the first production electric car in London in 1884, using his own specially designed <b>high-capacity</b> rechargeable batteries. Parker's long-held interest in the construction of more fuel-efficient vehicles led him to experiment with electric vehicles. He also may have been concerned about the malign effects smoke and pollution were having in London.|$|E
25|$|Urinals in <b>high-capacity</b> washrooms {{are usually}} {{arranged}} {{in one or}} more rows directly opposite the door, so that users have their backs to people entering or standing outside. Urinals in the street may be arranged in a circle, with all users facing the center, with partitions high enough that they cannot wet each other, and usually high enough that they cannot see over. In a street urinal with an outside screen or wall, the users may stand back to back.|$|E
25|$|Public {{transport}} {{includes a}} {{bus rapid transit}} system, called Mettis. Mettis vehicles are <b>high-capacity</b> hybrid bi-articulated buses built by Van Hool, and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with disability access. Mettis has its own planned and integrated transportation system, which includes two dedicated lines that spread out into the Metz conurbation. Mettis lanes A and B serve the city's major facilities (e.g. city centre, university campus, and hospitals), and a transport hub is located next to the railway station.|$|E
