50|$|At {{the time}} of its invention, the system was {{considered}} by experts to be a considerable advancement in shipping technology. LASH carriers were able to transport five times more cargo than a comparable conventional transport ship, the loading and unloading process was much more efficient, and a lack of <b>harbor</b> <b>equipment</b> or quay moorings provided no obstacle, as the lighters could be loaded directly onto the ship. The system also relieved the pressure to unload as quickly as possible, since the lighters already in the water could be moved while others were being unloaded. All told, these ships spent more than 80% of their annual application time at sea, whereas the conventional ships often lay at harbor for as much as half the year.|$|E
40|$|After the World War II, modern {{capitalistic}} {{economy is}} shifting from "laissez faire" economy to projecting. In our country, the reconstruction planning has been projected, and now area planning has been promoted. Hokkaido may {{be developed to}} attract the surplus population {{in the interior of}} the country. At 1953 the personal income per head in Hokkaido is 9028 and 1115 per cent of average income at whole country. This is higher than one of many district. The economic undevelopment of Hokkaido is illustrated such as follows-First sparse population, secondly capitalistic dependency to Honshu. For the economic development of this district, we should not endeavour to attract the surplus population simply, but to increase labor productivity by reinvestment. The Cold Climate is not the fatal obstacle to develop the industry. The personal income per head of Switzerland and North-European Countries are higher than one of the South-European Countries. These countries do not depend upon agriculture and mining but upon manufacturing industry and commerce. The industrial structure of Hokkaido is similar to one of the Switzerland. Tomakomai and Muroran district is most blessed with climate and transportation, so that chemical and iron industry has developed. At Asahikawa and Kitami district, the climate is more cold than Muroran, and the industry like as sugar-industry has been developed to help the agriculture. These industry has been operated seasonally and so the labor productivity is comparatively low as a year. Still more, as the other less developed district the laborer do not work very hard and has been contended with low standard of living. To develop this district, we should promote the minute industry by small firms to satisfy the domestic demand in Hokkaido. Thirdly Kushiro and Obihiro district is subject to very bad condition in view of climate and transportation, so that this area will be developed most behind. The aim of development should be to increase the national income, so that the industrialization is most important, because the sightseeing is nothing but the removal of national income. To increase the labor productivity we should not invest to agriculture but to industry. To complete the <b>harbor</b> <b>equipment</b> and road, we should depend on government investment, But the development of industry proper should be entrusted to private industry in view of capital efficiency. To stop the escape of capital, we should decrease the tax for fixed capital and provide the capital with low rate of interest. Thus, the effective demand will be increased, the industrial structure will be developed along with the theory of national income growth. The foreign trade is relatively small scale and the inter-communication with Honshu is relatively large Hokkido imports the industrial product and exports the raw materials. The agricultural population do not increase since 1945, the industrial population has increased steady rate of growth, the commercial population has increased rapidly, the personal income per head of agriculture has remained unchange since 1948, the industrial income has showed steadily growth, the commercial income increased rapidly. Comparing the labor productivity of manufacturing industry, Hokkaido is superior to Honshu, at paper-manufacturing, lumbering, metal-industry, glass-manufacturing and provision, industry. Oil manufacturing, rubber-manufacturing and machinary industry are inferior than one in Honshu. These industry need the enormous fixed capital, so that will not develop without protective policy. In view of transportation, Hokkaido is to be developed as an independent economic district, and after that we should consider the inter-communication with Honshu. And the investment to agriculture should increase the agricultural productivity. For instance, the rice-cultivation is to be stopped in view, of bad climate and special crops should be increased. Our analysis has reached this conclusion by travelling each district and considering the state statistically. The analysis for each industry will be achieved near, future. This analysis is writtened with scientific research expense by the Department of Education...|$|E

Appling, who had been promoted to major the previous April 15 and 120 of his riflemen were assigned to support Woolsey. One of the boats was separated from the others and was captured by the British. Captain Sir James Yeo decided to pursue the remaining Americans, who had withdrawn up Big Sandy Creek to fortify their position. [...] On the morning of 30 May, a large British force engaged the Americans. Appling, his riflemen and 120 Oneida Warriors had established an Ambuscade and surprised the British. The Battle of Big Sandy Creek lasted less than ten minutes and resulted in an overwhelming American victory. [...] The Americans captured 143 prisoners (133 men and 10 officers), wounded 20 (18 men and 2 officers); and killed 14 (13 men and one officer). They also captured three gun-boats, one with a 24-pounder and a 63-pounder; two cutters; and one gig. Effective May 30, 1814, Appling was brevetted as a lieutenant colonel for gallant conduct in capturing a superior force of the enemy at the Battle of Big Sandy Creek.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMicrobial {{contamination}} {{of peanut butter}} by Salmonella poses a significant health risk as Salmonella may remain viable throughout the product shelf life. Effective cleaning and sanitation of processing lines are essential for preventing cross-contamination. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of a cleaning and sanitation procedure involving hot oil and 60 % isopropanol, ± quaternary ammonium compounds, to decontaminate pilot-scale processing <b>equipment</b> <b>harboring</b> Salmonella. Peanut butter inoculated with a cocktail of four Salmonella serovars (∼ 7  log CFU/g) was used to contaminate the equipment (∼ 75  L). The system was then emptied of peanut butter and treated with hot oil (90  °C) for 2  h followed by sanitizer for 1  h. Microbial analysis of food-contact surfaces (7 locations), peanut butter, and oil were conducted. Oil contained ∼ 3. 2  log CFU/mL on both trypticase soy agar with yeast extract (TSAYE) and xylose lysine deoxycholate (XLD), indicating hot oil alone was not sufficient to inactivate Salmonella. Environmental sampling found 0. 25 – 1. 12  log CFU/cm 2 remaining on processing equipment. After the isopropanol sanitation (±quaternary ammonium compounds), no Salmonella was detected in environmental samples on XLD (< 0. 16  log CFU/cm 2). These data suggest that a two-step hot oil clean and isopropanol sanitization treatment may eliminate pathogenic Salmonella from contaminated equipment...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{isolates}} (n = 225) from bovine teat skin, human skin, milking equipment, and bovine milk were fingerprinted by pulsed-field {{gel electrophoresis}} (PFGE). Strains were compared to assess the role of skin and milking equipment as sources of S. aureus mastitis. PFGE of SmaI-digested genomic DNA identified 24 main types and 17 subtypes among isolates from 43 herds and discriminated between isolates from bovine teat skin and milk. Earlier, phage typing (L. K. Fox, M. Gershmann, D. D. Hancock, and C. T. Hutton, Cornell Vet. 81 : 183 - 193, 1991) had failed to discriminate between isolates from skin and milk. Skin isolates from humans belonged to the same pulsotypes as skin isolates from cows. Milking <b>equipment</b> <b>harbored</b> strains from skin as well as strains from milk. We conclude that S. aureus strains from skin and from milk can both be transmitted via the milking machine, but that skin strains are not {{an important source of}} intramammary S. aureus infections in dairy cows. A subset of 142 isolates was characterized by binary typing with DNA probes developed for typing of human S. aureus. Typeability and overall concordance with epidemiological data were lower for binary typing than for PFGE while discriminatory powers were similar. Within several PFGE types, binary typing discriminated between main types and subtypes and between isolates from different herds or sources. Thus, binary typing is not suitable as replacement for PFGE but may be useful in combination with PFGE to refine strain differentiation.

5000|$|About dawn on 17 April, lookouts on {{the attack}} cargo ship sighted Okinawa off the ship's {{starboard}} beam, some 16 miles away. Later that morning, she anchored off Okinawa and began unloading her boats at 1830. In the days that followed, Venango continued discharging the troops, cargo, and equipment of the 82nd Signal Battalion. Often at dawn and dusk, the call to general quarters alerted all hands that enemy air raiders were nearby. Although Venango sighted no Japanese planes, enemy raiders hit numerous nearby land targets as the cargo ship lay at anchor off Okinawa. On 22 April, she departed the Ryukyus and reached Saipan on the 27th. On 1 May, she shifted from the anchorage to a dock in Tanapag <b>harbor</b> to load <b>equipment</b> and cargo of the 21st Naval Construction Battalion for transportation to Okinawa. Two days later, she departed Saipan in convoy and, on the 27th, stood into Nakafusuku Wan. Numerous air raids alerts marked the days that followed. An hour after midnight on 31 May, Venango began discharging her cargo. Frequent alerts continued as she emptied her holds. On 3 June, a Japanese bomber splashed in the transport area; and, the next day, Venango made an emergency sortie with a six-ship merchant convoy to ride out an approaching typhoon. However, the typhoon did not strike Okinawa; and Venango returned to Nakagusuku Wan on the 5th and resumed unloading. On the 6th, action picked up; and observers on the cargo ship witnessed the air attack in which destroyer minelayers [...] and [...] shot down six Japanese aircraft, despite serious damage to both ships by kamikazes. Venango departed Okinawa in convoy on the 19th and steamed via Saipan to Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 29 June. She shifted berths to Honolulu harbor on 7 July. There, she loaded miscellaneous cargo, including beer, lumber, cement, and tar, before getting underway on the 13th and steaming independently for the Western Carolines. The same day, main engine damage forced her to reverse her course; and, on the 14th, she found herself back at Pearl Harbor for repairs. The attack cargo ship again departed Oahu on the 23rd, proceeded independently via Ulithi, and arrived at Hydrographer Bank in the Palaus on 6 August. Anchored between Peleliu and Angaur, she loaded cargo and got underway late the following afternoon. She entered Leyte Gulf {{on the morning of}} 9 August, unloaded cargo, and was anchored in Guiuan Roadstead off Samar on the 15th, when Japan capitulated.|$|R
