A marine navigation radar may also be a tool for surface current measurements. Point measurements of the current vector as well as current maps up to a distance of a few km can be provided (Gangeskar, 2002). Miros WAVEX has its main area of application as directional wave measurements from moving ships. Another example of a marine radar based system is OceanWaves WaMoS II.|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1970 / International Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaSpurious {{amplitude}} and {{phase modulation}} effects {{occur in the}} received telemetry signal when both the direct waves and the indirect waves enter the receiving antenna. In this paper, a simple multipath model is used which has a single direct wave and a single <b>indirect</b> <b>wave.</b> The <b>indirect</b> <b>wave</b> differs from the direct wave by a time delay and a constant amplitude. With such a simple model, the effects of multipath on telemetry data transmission can be fully examined because of the mathematical simplicity. First an FM system operating above the threshold is considered. The intermodulation distortion and the degradation in the data signal-to-noise ratio due to multipath are both examined. Next we consider two digital systems, namely the noncoherent FSK and the PCM/FM with the discriminator detection. Both systems utilize a split-phase baseband signal. And the error rates depend on the multipath time delay. Comparison is made between the split-phase and the NRZ (non-return-to zero) baseband signals. Available performance improvement from using the predetection diversity combining and the synchronization problem are then discussed.

40|$|Individual {{responses}} to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are varied and therefore potentially limit its application. There {{is evidence that}} this variability {{is related to the}} contributions of <b>Indirect</b> <b>waves</b> (I-waves) recruited in the cortex. The latency of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) can be measured through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), allowing an individual 2 ̆ 7 s responsiveness to tDCS to be determined. However, this single-pulse method requires several different orientations of the TMS coil, potentially affecting its reliability. Instead, we propose a paired-pulse TMS paradigm targeting I-waves as an alternative method. This method uses one orientation that reduces inter- and intra-trial variability. It was hypothesized that the paired-pulse method would correlate more highly to tDCS responses than the single-pulse method. In a randomized, double blinded, cross-over design, 30 healthy participants completed two sessions, receiving 20 min of either anodal (2 mA) or sham tDCS. TMS was used to quantify Short interval intracortical facilitation (SICF) at Inter stimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1. 5, 3. 5 and 4. 5 ms. Latency was determined in the posterior-anterior (PA), anterior-posterior (AP) and latero-medial (LM) coil orientations. The relationship between latency, SICF measures and the change in suprathreshold MEP amplitude size following tDCS were determined with Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlations. TMS measures, SICI and SICF were also used to determine {{responses to}} Anodal-tDCS (a-tDCS). Neither of the latency differences nor the SICF measures correlated to the change in MEP amplitude from pre-post tDCS (all P > 0. 05). Overall, there was no significant response to tDCS in this cohort. This study highlights the need for testing the effects of various tDCS protocols on the different I-waves. Further research into SICF and whether it is a viable measure of I-wave facilitation is warranted...|$|R

River inflows generally produced localized effects but there were indications of periodic turbidity flows to the deepest point of the lake from the major inflow. Active sediment focusing processes were the dominant distribution mechanisms, a major resuspension of sediment at autumn overturn probably being the most important.

40|$|Introduction: Palpation is an {{important}} diagnostic method to assess elasticity changes which indicate the presence of disease processes. Using modern medical imaging methods, elastography allows quantitative evaluation of mechanical changes in living tissue. This technique enables the investigation of organs like the human brain, which cannot be palpated. Mechanical waves are generated in the brain, and the acquired wave images are used to produce maps of viscoelasticity parameters. The major goal {{of this study was}} to develop an effective and gentle <b>indirect</b> <b>wave</b> excitation setup for high-resolution cerebral multifrequency magnetic resonance elastography (mMRE) and validate it as a clinically applicable method. Methods: The new remote wave excitation based on a thorax mat was compared to the established head rocker stimulation in 12 volunteers. A driving frequency range of 25 – 45 Hz was used for the excitation. Images were acquired in a coronal slice orientation in order to analyze specific anatomical regions along the spinothalamic pathway. A multifrequency inversion provided high-resolution maps of the viscoelastic parameters |G*| and φ. The amplitudes of the waves were quantified. After the measurements, the volunteers and the three operators completed a questionnaire rating the comfort and convenience of mMRE using the two methods of mechanical excitation. Results: The remote wave excitation setup was rated more comfortable (p = 0. 02) and easier to set up than the head rocker. Additionally, the variability of the shear wave amplitudes between the subjects, which occur with the conventional setup, was reduced. The viscoelastic parameters obtained with both setups were comparable. Specific elasticity values in the brain regions of pons (|G*| = 0. 97 ± 0. 08 kPa), capsula interna (|G*| = 1. 29 ± 0. 14 kPa) and crus cerebri (|G*| = 1. 64 ± 0. 26 kPa) were measured in this study for the first time. Discussion: Although pilot studies showed encouraging results in patients with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and brain tumors, cerebral mMRE has not been established in the clinic, due in part to discomfort from onerous mechanical stimulation applied directly to the head. The new method allows remote excitation, which improves patient comfort, and allows repeatable measurements with comparable wave amplitudes. As a result of these improvements, future mMRE studies have the potential to detect local viscoelasticity changes with higher sensitivity and in a wider range of patients. The <b>indirect</b> <b>wave</b> excitation setup simplifies and enhances the clinical applicability of mMRE for neuroradiological examinations...|$|E
40|$|Weak {{transcranial}} {{direct current}} stimulation (tDCS) {{of the human}} motor cortex results in excitability shifts which occur during and after stimulation. These excitability shifts are polarity-specific with anodal tDCS enhancing excitability, and cathodal reducing it. To explore {{the origin of this}} excitability modulation in more detail, we measured the input–output curve and motor thresholds as global parameters of cortico-spinal excitability, and determined intracortical inhibition and facilitation, as well as facilitatory <b>indirect</b> <b>wave</b> (I-wave) interactions. Measurements were performed during short-term tDCS, which elicits no after-effects, and during other tDCS protocols which do elicit short- and long-lasting after-effects. Resting and active motor thresholds remained stable during and after tDCS. The slope of the input–output curve was increased by anodal tDCS and decreased by cathodal tDCS. Anodal tDCS of the primary motor cortex reduced intracortical inhibition and enhanced facilitation after tDCS but not during tDCS. Cathodal tDCS reduced facilitation during, and additionally increased inhibition after its administration. During tDCS, I-wave facilitation was not influenced but, for the after-effects, anodal tDCS increased I-wave facilitation, while cathodal tDCS had only minor effects. These results suggest that the effect of tDCS on cortico-spinal excitability during a short period of stimulation (which does not induce after-effects) primarily depends on subthreshold resting membrane potential changes, which are able to modulate the input-output curve, but not motor thresholds. In contrast, the after-effects of tDCS are due to shifts in intracortical inhibition and facilitation, and at least partly also to facilitatory I-wave interaction, which is controlled by synaptic activity...|$|E
40|$|Responses to neuromodulatory {{protocols}} based {{either on}} transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS) {{are known to be}} highly variable between individuals. In this study, we examined whether variability of responses to anodal tDCS (a-tDCS) could be predicted from individual differences in the ability to recruit early or late <b>indirect</b> <b>waves</b> (I-waves), as reflected in latency differences of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) evoked by TMS of different coil orientation. Methods: Participants (n= 20) first underwent TMS to measure latency of MEPs elicited at different coil orientations (i. e., PA: posterior-anterior; AP: anterior-posterior; LM: latero-medial). Then, participants underwent a-tDCS (20 min @ 2 mA) targeting the primary motor cortex of the contralateral preferred hand (right, n= 18). Individual responses to a-tDCS were determined by monitoring changes in MEP amplitude at rest and in the duration of the contralateral silent period (cSP) and ipsilateral silent period (iSP) during contraction; the latter providing an index of the latency and duration of transcallosal inhibition (LTI and DTI). Results: Consistent with previous reports, individual responses to a-tDCS were highly variable when expressed in terms of changes in MEP amplitude or in cSP duration with ~ 50 % of the participants showing either little or no modulation. In contrast, individual variations in measures of transcallosal inhibition were less variable, allowing detection of significant after-effects. The reduced LTI and prolonged DTI observed post-tDCS were indicative of an enhanced excitability of the transcallosal pathway in the stimulated hemisphere. In terms of predictions, AP-LM latency differences proved to be good predictors of responses to a-tDCS when considering MEP modulation. Conclusion: The present results corroborate the predictive value of latency differences derived from TMS to determine who is likely to express canonical responses to a-tDCS in terms of MEP modulation. The results also provide novel suggestive evidence that a-tDCS can modulate the excitability of the transcallosal pathway of the stimulated hemisphere...|$|R

40|$|The spinal volleys {{evoked by}} single {{transcranial}} magnetic or electric stimulation over the cerebral motor cortex were recorded from a bipolar electrode {{inserted into the}} cervical epidural space of three conscious human subjects. These volleys were termed direct (D) and <b>indirect</b> (I) <b>waves</b> according to their latency. We measured the size and number of volleys elicited by magnetic stimulation at various intensities with subjects at rest and during 20 or 100 % maximum contraction of the contralateral first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI). Surface EMG activity was also recorded. Electrical stimulation evoked a D-wave volley. Magnetic stimulation at intensities up to about 15 % of stimulator output above threshold evoked only I-waves. At higher intensities, a D-wave {{could be seen in}} two of the three subjects. At all intensities tested, voluntary contraction increased the number and size of the I-waves, particularly during maximum contractions. However, there was only a small effect on the threshold for evoking descending activity. Voluntary contraction produced large changes in the size of EMG responses recorded from FDI. Because the recorded epidural activity is destined for muscles other than the FDI, it is impossible to say to what extent increased activity contributes to voluntary facilitation of EMG responses. Indeed, our results suggest that the main factor responsible for enhancing EMG responses in the transition from rest to activity is likely to be increased excitability of spinal motoneurones, rather than increases in the corticospinal volley. The latter may be more important in producing EMG facilitation at different levels of voluntary contraction...|$|R

We studied the interactions between SICI/ICF and SICF in 17 healthy subjects. Six experiments were conducted. The first experiment examined the effects of different S 1 intensities on SICI, ICF and SICF at three peaks. The effects of SICI on SICF were tested by a triple-pulse TMS protocol in the second experiment. We performed Experiments 3 – 5 to further test the interactions between SICI and SICF with various strengths of SICI, at SICF peaks and troughs, and with SICF generated by different current direction which preferentially generates late I waves. The effects of ICF on SICF were examined in Experiment 6. The results showed that ICF and SICF decreased whereas SICI increased with higher S 1 intensities. SICI facilitated SICF mediated by late I waves both at the peaks and the troughs of SICF. The increase of SICF in the presence of SICI correlated to the strength of SICI. ICF decreased the third peak of SICF.

This study aims firstly to identify {{which of the two}} variables, E or A, is the contributory factor to the increased E/A ratio and secondly to assess the relative influence of gestational age, heart rate, and stroke volume on the {{flow velocity}} profile through the fetal mitral valve. DESIGN [...] Eighty normal fetuses from 18 to 38 weeks of gestation were examined by Doppler echocardiography. The variables measured were E and A waves, the early and late flow velocity integrals (EI and AI), and the total filling velocity integral (TI). The ratios E/A and EI/AI were also calculated. Transvalvar flow was obtained by multiplying TI by mitral area. Associations between Doppler variables and gestational age, heart rate, and stroke volume were assessed by multifactorial Anova and simple or multiple stepwise regression analyses. RESULTS [...] The results showed that the heart rates found did not affect flow velocity variables. There were only weak correlations between both A and AI values and gestational age (negative) and volume load (positive).

The introduction of VAT heralded self-assessment, but in most instances without being integrated with income tax administration. Rather, VAT administration was assigned to a separate department. Special units for large taxpayers are now common following initial challenges, but programs for other taxpayer segments are still emerging.

40|$|Background Lonely {{individuals}} {{are more likely}} to socially withdraw, an effect attributed to social distrust and preference for solitude (Ernst and Cacioppo, 2000). However, it is alternatively possible that loneliness causes cognitive deficits, which in turn precipitate social withdrawal. Loneliness {{has been shown to be}} associated with decreased verbal fluency in the literature (Schnittger et al., 2012; Boss, 2015; Shankar et al., 2013). We wanted to investigate whether loneliness a) was related to changes in social engagement over time, and b) predicted verbal fluency, which in turn precedes social withdrawal, possibly due to communicative difficulties. Methods Data from 4715 participants who were not institutionalised, did not have dementia at baseline, and were involved in waves 3, 4, and 5 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), were used. Residualised change scores were calculated to evaluate changes in engagement in social activity between waves 3 and 5. A mediation model (within a Structural Equation Modelling framework) was used to evaluate whether verbal fluency (measured using an animal naming task at wave 4) mediated the association between loneliness at wave 3 (measured using the UCLA Loneliness scale; Russell, 1996) and residualised change scores in engagement in social activities between waves 3 and 5. Results Overall, engagement in social activities decreased from a median of 3 activities to 2 activities between waves 3 and 5. This change was predicted by both loneliness (Beta = - 0. 056, p< 0. 001) and verbal fluency (beta = 0. 083, p< 0. 001) such that loneliness predicted a decrease and verbal fluency an increase in social engagement. Verbal fluency was a mediator of the association between loneliness and changes in social engagement between <b>waves</b> (<b>indirect</b> effect = - 0. 009, p< 0. 001). Conclusions Results support the hypothesis that loneliness leads to a decrease in social engagement (possibly equivalent to social withdrawal), partly due to cognitive decline in verbal fluency. Results have implications for theoretical understanding of loneliness. Theories of loneliness alternately suggest that it is a motivational state to improve likelihood of engaging with others, and that it is a pathology that leads to social withdrawal. The current findings go some way towards elucidating this issue...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This thesis {{concerns}} {{certain aspects}} of the production of CCN. In-cloud oxidation followed by cloud droplet evaporation is an important chemical process where sulfate is produced, and only particles with radii bigger than a certain critical radius (rc) can go through this process. 	The original interval for the critical radius (rcmin = 0. 05 ìm, rcmax = 0. 2 ìm) has led to an overestimation of the concentration of CCN. The aim is therefore to develop a new parameterization of the critical radius {{and at the same time}} keep the consistency with realistic supersaturations in different types of clouds. An interval for the critical radius must be used because of the great variability of supersaturations. 	Based on the assumption that the critical radius must equal the critical radius for activation of CCN, two sets of intervals has been developed where the first is consistent with a marine background (rcmin = 0. 033 ìm, rcmax = 0. 060 ìm), and the second is consistent with a continental background (rcmin = 0. 044 ìm, rcmax = 0. 16 ìm). These results were implemented in NCAR CCM 3 (CCM-Oslo), from which results concerning cloud droplet concentration, effective cloud droplet radius an short <b>wave</b> <b>indirect</b> cloud forcing were made for the year of 2001. 	Comparisons have been made with earlier results where the original interval of the critical radius has been used. Both the marine and the continental values of the critical radius are smaller than the original values, with the marine values being the smallest. This led to a greater global mean of the cloud droplet concentration (123. 4 cm- 3 for the marine rc-interval), a smaller global mean of the effective cloud droplet radius (10. 6 ìm for the marine rc-interval) and a greater short wave cloud forcing (- 54. 82 Wm- 2 for the marine rc-interval). 	Considerable parts of South-America, Northern and Central parts of Africa and Northern parts of Australia proved to have smaller concentrations of cloud droplets, and hence larger effective droplet radius and smaller short wave cloud forcing, for the smallest choice of rcmin. The biases were small, especially for the cloud droplet concentration, and are probably results of a numerical error in the parameterizations of aerosol properties...|$|R
40|$|Homeopathy, Nature and Science The {{theory of}} the technologic and natural systems may {{be applied to the}} system man: a complex and chaotic system, {{controlled}} by the principle of self-organized criticality, and thus very sensible to the action of external excitations, governed by the electromagnetic interaction, which controls all the chemical reactions of the organism. The book emphasizes the possibility that the recent great decrease of the infective diseases, and the large contemporary increase of cancer might be due to the long-term effect of the medicines, that might have weaken the nervous and the immunitary systems. Homoeopathy is essentially a method for the preparation of medicines. For a long time it was ignored by established medicine and considered to be spurious. Scientists still largely adopt this view. ] The book summarizes the original theory proposed by Hahnemann (1755 - 1843), according to which health is bound up with the vital energy that harmonically controls interactions among various parts of the body and the subsequent ones. Recalls that homeopathy is based on three fundamental principles: (i) similarity (similia similibus curantur - similar things cure similar things), (ii) the effectiveness of medicines is increased by means of dilution, and (iii) the use of "dynamization", a process that also complements dilution. Then it analyze these principles, staring with the dilution. The preparation starts with the mixing of one part of a mother tincture with nine parts of water (or alcohol), then the mixture is shaken. A part of this mixture is extracted (it is called the first power and designated D 1) and it is again mixed with nine parts of water. The solution is shaken up once more and thus the medicine of the second power is obtained, obviously having one-hundredth part of the mother tincture. The procedure is repeated up to the sixth power. A molecule of the tincture vibrates with a characteristic frequency, whereas a molecule of water has a different characteristic frequency. Different tincture molecules are not necessarily in phase with one another. It follows that the phases are randomly distributed and therefore the vibrations sum is zero. To verify, it is enough to sum a sine function with all the others of the same period, having gradually increasing phases. It will be seen that the result will be zero. The same does not happen if more waves are added having different periods Vibrations of a mother molecule that is inserted into a mixture of molecules of the same type will interfere with them in all the possible phases, producing a nett external effect of zero vibrations (though each of the individual molecules will still be vibrating). This is not true when a wave encounters another wave with a different period. The isolation of a single molecule, by means of successive dilution, make sure that its oscillation is saved. Established science cannot give any explanation of the therapeutic mechanisms of these medicines, but here are some possible scientific approaches. It is known that a mole of a chemical element contains 1023 molecules. Tincture is present as a solution in the first mixture, its volume being a mole dissolved in a mole of water (that is in 18 grams). Let us repeat this dilution using, subsequently, always 18 grams of water. In a mixture of power 23, with perfect mixing, one molecule of the tincture would probably be present in a mixture of 18 grams of water. If a patient takes in 18 grams of a mixture having its power D 23, it will probably contain one mother molecule. It is clear that, having started with the initial solution of 18 grams of water, nothing more dilute than D 23 should be used. It will be shown that, if a patient takes one elementary molecule which is dynamicized, it turns out that excitation and mixing are very effective. Dynamization. The homeopathic molecules are shocked and thus ionized. The help of physics for homeopathy could be to suggest that further dynamizing of the mother tincture can be achieved by other source of external ionization. This would strengthen the motion of an isolated molecule of the mother tincture, and increase its vibrations. Another suggestion is that intravenous injection of an ampoule containing a pre-ionized mother molecule would be useful. Recently, the interception of a sick cell by injecting isotopes which are also able to ionize the cell has been successfully tried experimentally. A ionized molecule of the mother tincture may cross a ion flowing (i) in the current of blood, or (ii) along the digestive apparatus. The book estimates the order of magnitude of parameters for the study. (i) The blood speed v in an aorta is about 0. 6 m/sec (though it is not constant, as it is pulsed by the heart). From the energy equation h n = ½ m v 2, where n is the frequency of oscillation, m is the mass of an ionized mother molecule equal to 10 - 25 kg, and h is Planck’s constant. It follows that n = ½x 0. 62 x 10 - 25 / 6. 6 x 10 - 34, i. e., the order of magnitude of n is 107 Hz. Inside a very thin vein, owing to the friction, the speed is many times lower (10 - 3 m/sec), so that the frequency is reduced there to n = 76 Hz. (ii) Assuming that a molecule flows in the digestive apparatus with a mean speed v = 1 m/hour, the above computations yield n = 7 Hz. The frequency n would thus range between few hertz and 100 hertz, a range typical of the ions along the tissues and the cells. The principle of "similia similibus curantur. "The book, for the sake of argument, considers a “sick” molecule to be one that has its energy reduced to a great extent. The energy of a structure is given by the amplitude of its vibrations, because the energy is proportional to the square of a swing. It is natural that the frequency of oscillation of a “healthy” molecule is {{the same as that of}} a “sick” molecule. The interaction of the oscillation of a healthy molecule with the sick one, will increase the oscillation of the latter, though at the cost of diminishing its own oscillation, thus restoring just one molecule it to partial health. The encounter of a mother molecule with an sick molecule of the same type will transmit energy to the latter and therefore revitalize it. Two different way of interactions have been analysed, (i) the mechanic and (ii) the electromagnetic ones. (i) The only energy the “healthy” molecule can supply is what it contains, so at best you end up with two half-sick molecule. But the therapy may last many months, during which the going on restoring process becomes effective. (ii) A ion that moves with an accelerated motion generates an e. m. field, whose frequency’s spectrum may be estimated according to the above computations. Both the ionized homeopathic molecules and the ions transported by the lymphocytes flow in the current of the blood and generate e. m. spectra, typical of each ion. The similia similibus curantur principle ensure that both the spectra are equal so that the homeopathic e. m. field may excite and restore, through resonance, the e. m. field of the naturals ions flowing through the body. A similar effect may be hypothesized for the ions (notably Ca++) that move within the presinapys of the neurons of the cerebral system. This gives an analogy relevant to homeopathy that claims to cure faulty molecules with molecules having the same faults, i. e. according to the expression "similia similibus curantur". A molecule of a different type would have some different oscillation period and therefore would not be able to “resonate” with and cure a sick molecule. All in all, homeopathists unconsciously employ, in a therapeutic way, the physical mechanism used in nuclear magnetic resonance for diagnostic purposes. This technique, in fact, serves for the analysis of molecular complexes, it is based on the examination of the absorption spectrums of radio waves by nuclear magnetic resonance and applied to cells or tissue fragments. Now, in accordance with Kirchhoff’s law, if a substance absorbs a certain wave having frequency n, it is able to emit only and solely this wave. It follows that, simulating homeopathy, at a definite moment the frequency n of a sick molecule could be excited by means of resonance with a wave of the same frequency either to vivify it or, acting in an antiphase, to destroy it. Studies of pathogenic effects of radiation have shown that modifications of biological cells are essentially produced in an indirect way, through the transfer of the energy deriving from the irradiation of molecules of a solvent, or by radiolysis of water The aforementioned physical principles that are, perhaps unconsciously, the basis of homeopathy, can indicate the way to advancing homeopathic treatment: a better employment of stem-cells, of viruses and bacteria, remembering that viruses and bacteria are not only contrary to the life, but they also compliment it. The above physical model has explained the meteopathies and the music therapy and has supported the coherent electrodynamic theory proposed by Preparata. Homeopathy brings to mind, in a general sense, the therapeutic use of music, which has often been found to be effective. This method is, however, <b>indirect,</b> as acoustic <b>waves</b> received by the ear pass through neural cells to the brain, which, using its enormous and unexplored capabilities, processes them and gives to neurons themselves renewing stimuli affecting molecules and cells. Musical therapy uses and extends the same beneficent mechanism induced by the brain that produces joy and, therefore, revitalization, derived from listening to acoustic vibrations, analogously as light waves emitted by colours of a pictorial work or from harmonious lines simulating clear waves which delineate sculptural and architectural works. The book has analysed in detail the needle’s therapy and notably the use of the “Extremely Low magnetic Frequencies” (ELF) waves providing effective suggestions. It has shown that the frequencies employed belong to the same spectrum of the external geomagnetic fields, proving that there are interferences between these fields. Finally a magnetostrictive effect is suggested to explain the mechanism of the ELF. In conclusion, homeopathic therapy follows the Hippocratic method of using a few harmless medicines, aimed at assisting natural defensive and repairing processes. In contrast, official medicine, Galen’s heir, advocates a return to morbid pictures and morphological alterations of single organs or other body parts, intervening in these things from the outside. Omeopatia fra Natura e Scienza La teoria dei sistemi, che ha conseguito notevoli successi nella ricerca della genesi e nella previsione dell’evoluzione dei sistemi naturali, può sortire importanti risultati se applicata al sistema psico-fisico uomo. Per questo motivo, il testo riportata in sintesi gli approcci metodologici seguiti dalla teoria ed i suoi risultati. Parte dalla constatazione che, al pari di tutti gli altri sistemi dell’universo, l’uomo è un sistema dinamico unico ed indivisibile, complesso e caotico, è governato dal principio della criticità auto-organizzata e per questo molto sensibile all’azione delle perturbazioni esterne. I farmaci molto aggressivi eliminano i malanni a breve tempo, ma nel contempo, turbano i sistemi nervoso ed immunitario, inficiano la loro azione protettiva e quindi la loro capacità di debellare sul nascere i malanni gravi, i quali hanno tutto il tempo di irrobustirsi prima che il medico li accerti e cerchi poi di combatterli, quando è spesso troppo tardi. Questo sarebbe confermato dall’assenza di patologie gravi nelle popolazioni aborigene che avevano esercitato e quindi rafforzato le loro difese immunitarie. Ciò aiuterebbe a spiegare il motivo della diminuzione, nello scorso secolo, delle malattie infettive dal 50 al 5 %, ed il pari contemporaneo aumento delle patologie cronico-degenerative. Questo rischio non si corre invece assumendo rimedi omeopatici, i quali, invece, nel rispetto dell’equilibrio dell’ecosistema uomo, cercano di potenziare, per via elettromagnetica, i suoi meccanismi di autoregolazione, anche se, secondo la medicina ufficiale, non hanno sempre sortito i risultati perseguiti, perché occorrerebbe una terapia molto più lunga di quella praticata per rieducare un sistema indebolito dai farmaci e dalle mutate condizioni ambientali. Ricorda, infatti che i sistemi appartenenti al reame del vivente sono governati dall’interazione elettromagnetica, la quale presiede anche alle reazioni chimiche che in essi si verificano. Spiega i rimedi omeopatici in termini di interazione risonante fra i campi e. m. connessi al flusso delle molecole madri ionizzate ingerite dall’organismo con quelli associati al moto degli ioni nel sistema cerebrale ed in quello immunitario. Mostra, in generale, che l’omeopatia utilizza, a scopo terapeutico, gli stessi strumenti tecnologici costruiti sulla base dei risultati della fisica, recentemente usati con enorme successo a scopo diagnostico dalla medicina ufficiale. Fornisce una nuova interpretazione degli effetti delle onde ELF, basata sulla magnetostrizione, proponendone correzioni, affinamenti e l’uso in sinergia con la musicoterapica...|$|R
