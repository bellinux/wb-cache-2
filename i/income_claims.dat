40|$|This paper studies {{convertible}} security {{design for a}} sample of 814 issuers over the years 2000 through 2007. Using a nested logit model, we examine how firms choose fixed <b>income</b> <b>claims</b> and the method of payment. We find that fixed <b>income</b> <b>claims</b> are chosen to reduce corporate income taxes, minimize refinancing costs, and help mitigate managerial discretion costs. The method of payment choice frequently includes cash settlement features because they increase reported diluted earnings per share. Some of the cash settlement issuers also adopt other innovative financial strategies (share repurchase programs and call spread overlays) that inflate reported earnings per share. We find that firms needing debt capacity include mandatory conversion features. © 2011...|$|E

40|$|A corporation's {{securities}} {{provide the}} holder with particular claims on the firm's income stream and particular voting rights. These securities {{can be designed}} in various ways: one share of a particular class may have a claim to votes which is disproportionately larger or smaller than its claim to income. In this paper we analyze some of the forces which make it desirable {{to set up the}} corporation so that all securities have the same proportion of votes as their claim to income ("one share/one vote"). We show that security structure influences both the conditions under which a control change takes place and the terms on which it occurs. First, the allocation of voting rights to securities determines which securities a party must acquire in order to win control. Secondly, the assignment of <b>income</b> <b>claims</b> to the same securities determines the cost of acquiring these voting rights. We will show that it is in shareholders' interest to set the cost of acquiring control to be as large as possible, consistent with a control change occurring whenever this increases shareholder wealth. Under certain assumptions, one share/one vote best achieves this goal. We distinguish between two classes of benefits from control: private benefits and security benefits. The private benefits of control refer to benefits the current management or the acquirer obtain for themselves, but which the target security holders do not obtain. The security benefits refer to the total market value of the corporation's securities. The assignment of <b>income</b> <b>claims</b> to voting rights determines the extent 'to which an acquirer must face competition from parties who value the firm for its security benefits rather than its private benefits. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} {{macroeconomic}} outcomes is developed in which money and aggregate demand matter, in-flation is {{the outcome of}} conflicting nominal <b>income</b> <b>claims,</b> and institutions create relatively enduring “conditional closures ” in otherwise open macroeconomic processes. This model is used to hypothesize that U.

S. labor market that, by the late 1990 s, rendered workers ’ employment and income prospects insecure. Empirical results confirm that increased worker insecurity contributes to explaining U. S. inflation since 1973, and that by the 1990 s, the inflation costs of any given rate of unemployment in the United States had been reduced. It is suggested that the supply side of the U. S. economy may now be capable of sustaining low unemployment and inflation outcomes, primarily as a result of labor market institutions that have “zapped ” U. S. labor.

40|$|An {{important}} issue in neo-Kaleckian growth theory is whether higher employment and growth can be promoted {{by increasing the}} wage share or whether growth and equity are conflicting objectives. It {{has been argued that}} profit-led growth regimes are more likely in an open economy, at least in the short-run. This paper reconsiders this question, by developing a macroeconomic model for the medium-run where distribution and inflation are caused by conflicting nom- inal <b>income</b> <b>claims.</b> In this context, we show that the strict alternative between wage-led and profit-led growth is misguided, and that an expansion of real wages and employment is feasible when enduring income policies are established. Hin- drance to these policies is reminiscent of the political opposition to permanent full-employment envisaged by Kalecki. Our analysis suggests that the slowdown of capital accumulation typical of the neoliberal era, is due to recently promoted anti- labour reforms. We have also compared our results with neo-Keynesian macroe- conomic models which share the same emphasis on the role of insitutions in the labour market. ...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the wide}} spread use of {{psychological}} {{instruments in the}} forensic context, there is a dearth {{of research on the}} purposes for using it. A qualitative case study approach was adopted in this study to explore the purposes for which industrial psychologists use psychological instruments in loss of <b>income</b> <b>claims.</b> The research study comprised of two phases. Firstly, a literature review was used to provide some background on psychological assessment in the forensic context. The literature review described the historical development of forensic psychology, what psychological instruments are and how they are used in the forensic context. The forensic context, in which industrial psychologists operate, was also described. Furthermore, the initial conceptual framework to outline the context of the next phase of the research was illustrated. The second phase was an exploratory study that made use of a multiple-case study approach. The main research aim was to explore the purposes for using psychological instruments in loss of <b>income</b> <b>claims</b> by industrial psychologists. Another aim was to explore the psychological instruments used. The final aim was to explore the kind of information that is needed in the forensic context, which is not currently available by means of existing psychological assessment. Case study data was collected by conducting semi-structured interviews with four industrial psychologists. Each interview represented a case to be analysed. The multiple-case study data gathered were then analysed using coding, within-case analysis and across-case analysis. The findings indicate that psychological instruments are used for the following purposes: (1) to add value to the quantification of a loss of income claim; and (2) to provide information that is required on the specific situation and circumstances surrounding the claim. Furthermore, the research findings also revealed that the purpose of using a psychological instrument to add value is influenced by internal factors of the psychological instrument as well as situational characteristics of the legal matter at hand. Through the exploration of the purposes for using psychological instruments, specific instruments used could be identified. Another finding included the existence of a perception that the psychological instruments currently available in South Africa are inadequate to provide the information required in the forensic context. The findings also revealed the kind of information that is needed. Recommendations were made for future research and industry-related practices. Industrial and Organisational PsychologyM. Comm.

40|$|After Poland's {{remarkable}} {{stabilization and}} liberalization in 1990, the economy faced three related problems: high wage and pension claims, a rising number of pensioners and unemployed workers, and a budget crisis, especially in 1991 and 1992. The author studies {{the role that}} wage and pension pressures played in this crisis. He also explains {{the persistence of the}} high tax wedge that later helped overcome the budget crisis. The positive effect on revenues of higher wages and higher tax rates could not compensate for both the inevitable loss in profit taxes and the excessive growth of spending on replacement income. Counterfactuals constructed for revenue and spending show the rising number of social benefit earners (pensions, unemployment) to be responsible for much of the budgetary burden. But they also show that the better protection of social income (over other income) explains part of the burden. Part of the employment loss and social spending can be ascribed to the excessive wage recovery of late 1990 and 1991. Insiders set wages ignoring the unemployed and exploiting the pension system in a context of uncertainty about profits and productivity, {{at a time when there}} was strong popular support for the protection of replacement income. The author recommends pension reform and caution about wages: the current economic recovery should create jobs, not raise wages, he says; and ensuring equitable opportunities for all requires moderating the <b>income</b> <b>claims</b> of the best-protected groups.

40|$|Health {{care policy}} in Canada {{is based on}} {{providing}} public funding for medically necessary physician and hospital-based services free {{at the point of}} delivery (“first-dollar public funding”). Studies consistently show that the introduction of public funding to support the provision of health care services free at the point of delivery is associated with increases in the proportionate share of services used by the poor and in population distributions of services that are independent of <b>income.</b> <b>Claims</b> about the success of Canada’s health care policy tend to be based on these findings, without reference to medical necessity. This article adopts a needs-based perspective to reviewing the distribution of health care services. Despite the removal of user prices, significant barriers remain to services being distributed in accordance with need—the objective of needs-based access to services remains elusive. The increased fiscal pressures imposed on health care in the 1990 s, together with the failure of health care policy to encompass the changing nature of health care delivery, seem to represent further departures from policy objectives. In addition, there is evidence of increasing public dissatisfaction with the performance of the system. A return to modest increases in public funding in the new millennium has not been sufficient to arrest these trends. Widespread support for first-dollar public funding needs to be accompanied by greater attention to the scope of the legislation and the adoption of a needs-based focus among health care policymakers. The primary objective of Canadian health care policy is to protect, promote and restore the physical and mental well-being of residents of Canada and to facilitate reasonable access to health services without financial or other barriers...|$|E
