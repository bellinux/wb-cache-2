5|$|The {{captain had}} to record his survey in {{painstaking}} paperwork, and Darwin too kept a <b>daily</b> <b>log</b> {{as well as}} detailed notebooks of his finds and speculations, and a diary which became his journal. Darwin's notebooks show a complete professionalism that he had probably learnt at the University of Edinburgh when making natural history notes while exploring {{the shores of the}} Firth of Forth with his brother Erasmus in 1826 and studying marine invertebrates with Robert Edmund Grant for a few months in 1827. Darwin had also collected beetles at Cambridge, but he was a novice in all other areas of natural history. During the voyage Darwin investigated small invertebrates, while collecting specimens of other creatures for experts to examine and describe once the Beagle had returned to England. More than half of his carefully organised zoology notes deal with marine invertebrates, and the notes record closely reasoned interpretations of what he found about their complex internal anatomy while dissecting specimens under his microscope, and of little experiments on their response to stimulation. His onshore observations included intense, analytical comments on possible reasons for the behaviour, distribution, and relation to their environment of the creatures he saw. He made good use of the ship's excellent library of books on natural history, but continually questioned their correctness.|$|E

25|$|Business records exception: {{business}} records created during the {{ordinary course of business}} are considered reliable and {{can usually be}} brought in under this exception if the proper foundation is laid when the records are introduced into evidence. Depending on which jurisdiction the case is in, either the records custodian or someone with knowledge of the records must lay a foundation for the records, however. The use of police records, especially as substantive evidence against the accused in a criminal trial, is severely restricted under the Business Records exception. Typically, only generalized evidence about police procedure is admissible under this exception, and not facts about a specific case. For example, John is stopped for speeding 70 miles per hour in a 50-mile-per-hour zone. The officer, who determined John's speed with radar, records the speed in an incident report. He also calibrates and runs a diagnostic on his radar every day prior to beginning his shift. He records this in a log. At trial, the report itself would not be admissible as it pertained to the facts of the case. However, the officer's <b>daily</b> <b>log</b> in which he records his calibration and the daily diagnostics of his radar unit would be admissible under the {{business records}} exception.|$|E

500|$|Captain Harris, and his successor, Captain Frazier Augustus Boutelle, {{established}} {{a network of}} soldier and snowshoe cabins throughout the remote portions of the park. These cabins, strategically located about [...] apart, were used by detachments of soldiers throughout the year as they stayed watchful for wildfires, vandalism and poaching. [...] The use of remote ranger cabins for patrolling the park is still practiced by Park Rangers. Captain Young, during his first tour as Acting Superintendent in 1897, established patrol cabin policies that are essentially still followed by Park Rangers. Young required that soldiers using a patrol cabin keep a <b>daily</b> <b>log</b> of activities, including game counts, visitor counts and weather observations. [...] These logs were used to compile a monthly report sent to the headquarters at Fort Yellowstone. [...] Young issued the following orders to all soldiers using the snowshoe cabins.|$|E

Deveau saw that the cabin interiors were wet and untidy from water that had entered through doorways and skylights, but were otherwise in reasonable order. In Briggs's cabin, Deveau found personal items scattered about, including a sheathed sword under the bed, {{but most of the}} ship's papers were missing, together with the captain's navigational instruments. Galley equipment was neatly stowed away; there was no food prepared or under preparation, but there were ample provisions in the stores. There were no obvious signs of fire or violence; the evidence indicated an orderly departure from the ship, by means of the missing lifeboat.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — P 2 P file-sharing {{applications}} are quickly being {{adopted by a}} wider and more mainstream audience. There is much {{to be learned from}} keyword searches users perform in order to retrieve content from these networks. This paper presents a large-scale measurement study of search terms in the modern Gnutella network. We developed a highly parallelized architecture capable of capturing an unprecedented amount of geographical-identified queries. We applied this architecture to generate <b>daily</b> <b>logs</b> of search queries. We collected over 25 such <b>daily</b> Gnutella <b>logs,</b> with more than 15 millions unique queries in each, over a three month period. We analyzed both static snapshots of the Gnutella networks, as well as the dynamics of the network over time. In particular, we look at the geographic location and the trends of searches to better understand the dynamics. I...|$|R
