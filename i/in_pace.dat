5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations <b>in</b> <b>pace</b> enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} effects of pacing modes on the {{interaction}} between the left ventricle and arterial system in humans. DESIGN [...] The slope of the end systolic pressure-volume relation (end systolic elastance), effective arterial elastance, the ratio of effective arterial elastance to end systolic elastance, and mechanical energy efficiency were compared under different pacing modes (atrial, atrioventricular, and ventricular). PATIENTS [...] Nine male patients with sick sinus syndrome who had cardiac catheterisation for diagnosis and to see whether they needed a pacemaker. INTERVENTIONS [...] A conductance catheter with tip-manometer was inserted into the left ventricle to obtain pressure-volume loops, and two pacing catheters were inserted into the right atrium and into the right ventricle respectively. RESULTS [...] End systolic elastance was lower <b>in</b> atrioventricular <b>pacing</b> than <b>in</b> atrial <b>pacing,</b> but effective arterial elastance was not significantly different. End systolic elastance was lower <b>in</b> ventricular <b>pacing</b> than <b>in</b> atrioventricular <b>pacing,</b> and effective arterial elastance was higher <b>in</b> ventricular <b>pacing</b> than <b>in</b> atrioventricular <b>pacing.</b> Consequently the ratio of effective arterial elastance to end systolic elastance was lowest <b>in</b> atrial <b>pacing</b> and highest <b>in</b> ventricular <b>pacing,</b> and mechanical energy efficiency was highest <b>in</b> atrial <b>pacing</b> and lowest <b>in</b> ventricular <b>pacing.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] Atrial contraction and synchronous ventricular contraction independently optimise ventriculoarterial coupling in terms of a transfer of energy. Thus atrial pacing gives the best ventriculo-arterial coupling among these pacing modes...|$|R
5|$|Gotcha is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari and released in October 1973. It {{was the fourth}} game by the company, after the 1972 Pong, which {{marked the beginning of}} the commercial video game industry, and the 1973 Space Race and Pong Doubles. In the game, two players move through a maze, which continually changes over time. One player, the Pursuer, attempts to catch the other, the Pursued; if they do, a point is scored, and the players reset positions. The game emits an electronic beeping sound, which increases <b>in</b> <b>pace</b> as the Pursuer gets closer to the Pursued, and each game lasts a set amount of time.|$|E

When Australia batted, Johnston and Ernie Toshack wagged a last-wicket partnership of 33 runs in only 18 minutes.

5|$|The first innings set {{the pattern}} of the series as the England top-order {{struggled}} against Australia's pace attack. Only twenty minutes of play was possible before the lunch break due to inclement weather, but it was enough for Miller to bowl Hutton. During the interval, heavy rain made the ball skid through upon resumption. Washbrook was caught attempting to hook Lindwall. At 15/2, Compton came in, and together with Edrich, they took the score to 46 before left arm paceman Johnston bowled the latter. Two balls later, Johnston removed Hardstaff without scoring, leaving England at 46/4. Two runs later, Compton was bowled by Miller and half the English team were out with only 48 runs on the board. Lindwall was forced to leave the field mid-innings due to a groin injury and did not bowl again. Johnston bowled Barnett and when Evans and Yardley were both dismissed with the score on 74, England only had two wickets left. Laker and Bedser scored more than half of England's total, adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes. Both fell within two runs, ending England's innings at 165. Laker top-scored with 63. Johnston ended with 5/36, a display characterised with accuracy and variations <b>in</b> <b>pace</b> and swing. Miller took 3/38 and a catch.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{some of the}} {{existing}} teams, Forti was able to test its chassis extensively {{prior to the start}} of the season. However, Diniz proved to be around seven seconds per lap off the pace of the leading runners in group testing at the Estoril circuit in March, indicating that the team was likely to be mired at the back of the field. Diniz finished 10th in the season-opening Brazilian GP, but was seven laps down on winner Michael Schumacher. In Argentina, this situation became worse, as, although both drivers finished, they were both nine laps down on winner Damon Hill at the end of the race (with Diniz ahead) and neither were classified, as they had failed to complete 90% of the race distance. The drivers' similar fastest laps during the race were over ten seconds slower than Schumacher's fastest race lap, and almost five seconds slower than the next slowest runner's fastest lap (Domenico Schiattarella in the Simtek). Imola was similarly poor, as both drivers finished seven laps down (with Diniz again ahead) and again failed to reach the 90% threshold for classification. Forti was already the butt of paddock jokes, and were far slower than the other (and financially poorer) backmarkers: Pacific, Simtek, and Minardi. However, the budget enabled improvements to be made to the car. During the season, its weight was reduced by a significant 60 kilograms (approximately 10% of the F1 minimum weight limit of 595kg), and a semi-automatic gearbox, an airbox and redesigns of the front wing, sidepods and monocoque were introduced. The personnel count also doubled during the course of the season. This resulted in a gradual improvement <b>in</b> <b>pace</b> throughout the year, and there were no more non-classified finishes.|$|E

40|$|Exogenous {{adenosine}} {{causes a}} monophasic dilation of the coronary vessels <b>in</b> <b>paced,</b> perfused rat heart preparations. Because levels of endogenous adenosine <b>in</b> <b>paced</b> hearts may mask {{the presence of}} high potency adenosine receptors, we have developed a method to measure coronary vascular responses in a potassium-arrested heart. Hearts from adult male, Wistar rats were perfused at a constant flow rate of 10 mL/min in the nonrecirculating, Langendorff mode, using Krebs-Henseleit buffer. After 30 min, coronary perfusion pressure was 44 +/- 1 mmHg (mean +/- SEM). Hearts were then perfused with a modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 35 mM potassium. Coronary perfusion pressure increased by 84 +/- 3 mmHg. Adenosine-induced reductions in coronary perfusion pressure were expressed {{as a percentage of}} the maximal increase in pressure produced by modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer from the equilibration level. A concentration-response curve for adenosine (n = 6) was biphasic and best described by the presence of two adenosine receptors, with negative log EC 50 values of 8. 8 +/- 0. 3 and 4. 3 +/- 0. 1, representing 29 +/- 3 and 71 +/- 3 %, respectively, of the observed response.
