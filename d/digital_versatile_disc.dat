The SERS properties of these substrates have been studied in terms of the enhancement factor (EF), point-to-point reproducibility and sample-to-sample repeatability. It turned out that high SERS EF and good reproducibility requirements are both fulfilled. As for repeatability, remarkably better results than typical literature values have been achieved.

40|$|Organolead halide perovskites have {{attracted}} extensive attention as light harvesting materials for optoelectronic devices {{due to their}} high charge carrier mobility, high photoconversion efficiency, and long charge diffusion length. In this study, we present the first self-powered organolead halide perovskite single crystal photodetector driven by a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). A high-performance planar photodetector showing a responsivity of 7. 92 A W- 1 to white light under a bias of 4 V was fabricated on the (100) facet of a bulk CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite single crystal.

50|$|The DVD (<b>Digital</b> <b>Versatile</b> <b>Disc</b> or Digital Video Disc), the {{eventual}} successor of the CD (Compact Disc), met {{a long road}} of setbacks. Philips wanted {{to continue with the}} CD in a new format called MultiMedia Compact Disc (MMCD), while another group (led by Toshiba) was developing a competing format, then named Super Density (SD) disc. Their representatives approached IBM for advice on the file system. IBM also learned of Philips' and Sony's initiative. IBM convinced a group of computer industry experts (among them Apple, Dell, etc.) to form a working group. The Technical Working Group (TWG) voted to boycott both formats unless they merged to prevent another format war (like the videotape format war). The result was the DVD specification, finalized in 1995. The DVD video format was first introduced in Japan in 1996, later in 1997 in the U.S. as limited test run, then across Europe and the other continents from late 1998 onwards.|$|E

The last-minute adoption of the hybrid DVD format was agreed to by all three companies {{in an effort to}} avoid a damaging format war, similar to that between Beta and VHS in the 1970s and 1980s. Toshiba failed to reach a similar compromise agreement with Sony in the race to develop a high-definition optical video disc format in the 2000s. This proved to be a costly mistake for Toshiba (and the format's co-developers, NEC and Microsoft), and the AOD (Advanced Optical Disc) format, later renamed HD DVD, lost a brutal format war with Sony's Blu-ray Disc (BD) format.

40|$|The {{replication}} of polymeric microstructures {{on a flat}} surface is not easily achieved by conventional injection molding, because of the required micro-dimensional control and the stringent tolerances of most applications.

On the other hand, injection-compression molding is an established process for the manufacturing of optical storage media, like compact <b>discs</b> (CD) or <b>digital</b> <b>versatile</b> <b>discs</b> (DVD), with grooves and pits at the micro-scale. The difficulties arise mainly from two sources: lack of adequate filling because of premature freezing of features with very small thicknesses and excessive deformation during ejection due to high friction at the polymer-metal interface. In this work, a study is carried out to investigate the effect of process parameters on the {{replication of}} various microstructures on a flat disk using microinjection-compression molding.

40|$|I {{worked with}} some of the most {{prominent}} British scientists in the field of holography to develop and establish a holographic-based encryption standard for CDs, DVDs and other electronic publishing devices which are currently the target of large scale organised piracy. It has successfully resulted in the actual and proposed filings of several British and European patents covering the application of the holographic technology to the watermarking and digital copy-protection of data storage devices. My innovation relates to <b>digital</b> <b>versatile</b> <b>discs</b> and in particular a holographic switch that acts as analogue signal within the digital content. My innovation is the creation of an analogue hologram on the surface of a compact disc. The hologram provides information that will be unique to the disc in question and to its originator, thus providing a security switch to identify the disc as a genuine product. The major benefits of this revolutionary digital disc protection process are essentially three-fold: •	Illegal copies of CDs and DVDs can be spotted at a glance (literally), •	The holographic-switch technology deployed in new players will prevent the disc from being copied OR can serve to limit the numbers of copies made from each original •	The process is extremely cost-efficient as no additional manipulation to existing mass-stamping processes is required once the master disc has been created.

Application of liquid crystals within optics has been a growing trend from flat screen displays to variable focus lenses in a <b>digital</b> <b>versatile</b> <b>discs.</b> One area of the recent developments within optics has been the development of two-photon fluorescence microscopy and high-density three-dimensional optical data storage. In such applications, where a light beam has to be focused deep within the volume of bulk media, aberrations are introduced. The most dominant aberration is spherical aberration which results from the mismatch in refractive indices of the immersion and recording media. The aim of this thesis is to design a liquid crystal lens for dynamic tube length compensation of the spherical aberration. Liquid crystal phase plates are used in everyday liquid crystal displays (LCDs) such as mobile phones and calculators. The technologies required to manufacture a liquid crystal phase plate are well understood. However, an application like three-dimensional data storage requires different properties in the liquid crystal phase plate, which are investigated in this thesis. To fabricate our liquid crystal phase plate we used ZLI- 5049 - 000 from MERCK as the liquid crystal medium, with poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) and Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) providing the insulating and conducting layers, respectively. It has been demonstrated that vacuum vapour deposition can be used to coat a glass substrate with ITO.

The latter have become of great importance throughout the last decade: nowadays {{a significant amount of}} data is stored on compact <b>discs</b> (CDs) and <b>digital</b> <b>versatile</b> <b>discs</b> (DVDs). A few years ago, rewritable CDs and DVDs have become commercially available and are widely used these days. In these storage media, a thin film of an antimony (Sb) or tellurium (Te) alloy is locally and reversibly switched by laser heating between the amorphous and the crystalline state. These states can be distinguished optically by their difference in reflectivity. Due to the reversibility of the phase transformation, rewritable CDs and DVDs are also called phase change media. The corresponding Sb and Te alloys are frequently termed phase change materials. Recently, phase change materials have also shown high potential for the development of non-volatile electronic phase change random access memories. In this application, a current pulse provides the heat that is necessary to induce the phase transformation between the amorphous and the crystalline state, which can be distinguished by their difference in electrical conductivity. First prototypes of this memory type are currently developed by the industry and demonstrate fast non-volatile data storage. There are good prospects that these memories finally replace current data storage devices in modern computers. In order to accomplish this, however, it is highly necessary to understand the phase transformation between the amorphous and the crystalline phase for Sb and Te alloys. This thesis makes a contribution to a fundamental understanding of the crystallization kinetics of amorphous and liquid phase change materials. The results should help to optimize both optical and electronic phase change media in terms of data transfer rates and scalability...|$|R
