5|$|A common Palestinian dessert {{reserved}} {{only for}} Ramadan is qatayef, {{which could be}} provided by the numerous street vendors in several major Palestinian cities or towns as well as typical Palestinian households. Qatayef is the general name of the dessert as a whole, but more specifically, the name of the batter that acts as a base. The result of the batter being poured into a round hot plate appears similar to pancakes, except only one side is cooked, then folded. The pastry is filled with either unsalted <b>goat</b> <b>cheese</b> or ground walnuts and cinnamon. It is then baked and served with a hot sugar-water syrup or sometimes honey.|$|E
5|$|Oysters {{come from}} the Oléron-Marennes basin, while mussels {{come from the}} Bay of Aiguillon. High-quality produce comes from the region's hinterland, {{especially}} <b>goat</b> <b>cheese.</b> This region and in the Vendée is grazing ground for Parthenaise cattle, while poultry is raised in Challans. The region of Poitou-Charentes purportedly produces the best butter and cream in France. Cognac is also made in the region along the Charente River. Limousin {{is home to the}} high-quality Limousin cattle, as well as high quality sheep. The woodlands offer game and high-quality mushrooms. The southern area around Brive draws its cooking influence from Périgord and Auvergne to produce a robust cuisine.|$|E
25|$|Cheese grew {{to become}} one of the most {{commonly}} produced and consumed products on the island and is regularly served as part of a starter course or as a snack. Farms at Arico, La Orotava and Teno produced a variety of cheeses, including soft cheeses, cured, smoked and were mostly handmade. Today the main product is <b>goat</b> <b>cheese,</b> although certain amounts are made from sheep's or cow's milk, and according to the Registro General Sanitario de Alimentos, the general health registry, around 75 different cottage cheeses are produced. The cheeses of the Canaries have generally received good international reviews, noted for their sweetness which differentiates them from certain other European cheeses. In particular, Tenerifan cured goats cheese was awarded best cheese in the world final of the 2008 World Cheese Awards held in Dublin, Ireland.|$|E

25|$|Gourmets {{generally}} prefer {{white wine}} to red to accompany cheese as its acidity agrees {{well with the}} fat in dairy products. Dry wines with mineral aromas such as chardonnay or sauvignon blanc bring out the milky taste of <b>goat</b> <b>cheese.</b> Aromatic wines, such as Gewurztraminer and some sparkling wines support the strong taste of Washed-rind cheeses (Maroilles, Epoisses, Munster, etc.). Neutral white wines (Castilla-La Mancha, Italian Trebbiano) are well suited to sheep cheese {{and there are also}} Manchego and pecorino romano for a little spicy. The cooked pressed cheeses require a bold wine, woodland. There is perfect agreement between the Comté cheese and the yellow wine of the Jura. Fortified wines are recommended with veined cheeses (Blue or Roquefort). In this case, the cheese mould (Penicillium roqueforti) and the wine (noble rot) form a harmonious whole.|$|E
25|$|While {{versions}} are made commercially elsewhere, Cotija cheese {{is made in}} Cotija, Tocumbo and Los Reyes in Michoacán and Quitupan, Santa María del Oro and Jilotlán de los Dolores in Jalisco. These communities are in the Sierra de Jal-Mich region, which straddles the two states. To receive this recognition, the cheese must also be made with pasteurized milk to prevent food-borne illness. This <b>goat</b> <b>cheese</b> was developed in Mexico entirely and has a taste and texture {{similar to that of}} Italian parmesan. It has a light golden hue and pronounced sour-milk aroma. It is aged an average of 12 months and sometimes the wheels are covered in a chili pepper paste to prevent mold. It is usually sprinkled on dishes as an accent, but can be used to flavor pastas and salads. This cheese is also popular in the United States, where it is both imported and made domestically. However, the US-made Cotija differs noticeable from its Mexican namesake, as American producers add enzymes to speed up the aging process.|$|E
500|$|In December 1992 Wolfgang Puck was {{the first}} celebrity chef to open an upscale {{restaurant}} in a Las Vegas gambling resort with Spago at Caesars Palace. Located in The Forum Shops arcade, the restaurant is divided into a cafe facing the shopping mall serving lighter, lower-cost dishes, and a more formal dining room to the rear. Under the direction of Executive Chef Eric Klein, the menu changes daily with seasonal American fare, such as [...] "Roasted Organic Baby Beet and <b>Goat</b> <b>Cheese</b> Salad, Handmade Agnolotti, and Kobe Flat Iron Steak 'Hunan Style'".

500|$|Pricing {{is similar}} to other {{restaurants}} owned by Ramsay, and {{it is intended to}} bring a fine dining experience out of specialist airport lounges and make it available to any traveller. Starters include a pea, leek and <b>goat</b> <b>cheese</b> tart, while mains include sea bass which is steamed and served alongside lemongrass and white asparagus. Chocolate fondue with marshmallows and waffles are among the options for dessert as well as a knickerbocker glory. Traditional fine dining dishes are also included on the menu, such as Sevruga caviar. Ramsay said in interviews around the launch of the restaurant that he aimed to keep [...] "it all very lean, lean, lean. No heavy sauces". He compared the menu to a cross between The Ivy, his own Boxwood Cafe and The Wolseley. A specific menu is offered for quick dining, called [...] "Plane Fast".

500|$|A {{review in}} Publishers Weekly called the book an [...] "exuberant parade of pork fat", and commented, [...] "there's plenty {{good to be}} had in these pages".

[...] Amy Culbertson of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram also compared the Villas's work to another book on bacon, writing, [...] "His is a more definitive cookbook than last year's [...] "Seduced by Bacon" [...] by Joanna Pruess". The book was highlighted in the [...] "Holiday Cookbook Roundup: Gift Guide" [...] column of The Austin Chronicle, where writer Mick Vann concluded, [...] "This {{is one of the}} few cookbooks you'll find where every single recipe makes you want to head straight for the stove, whether it's a bacon, <b>goat</b> <b>cheese,</b> and sweet-onion pie; Russian borscht; beef-stuffed plantains; or braised Japanese pork belly. For those fellow bacon lovers in our midst, Villas' The Bacon Cookbook is required reading." [...] In honor of International Bacon Day in 2009, the National Pork Board offered recipes from The Bacon Cookbook. Bonnie Stern of Financial Post recommended the book, and commented, [...] "Few of us can resist the allure of sizzling, smokey, crispy bacon. Though not usually high on the list of foods that are considered good for you, if you don't eat it often, you can have your bacon and eat it, too. If you want to know all about bacon, have a look at The Bacon Cookbook by James Villas".|$|E

2500|$|By 1980, Alice Waters' Chez Panisse and {{its head}} chef, Jeremiah Tower, had already invented California cuisine, a {{combination}} of French and Italian techniques and presentation with fresh local ingredient-focused flavors. Waters was a long-time fan of Tommasso's Italian restaurant in San Francisco's North Beach, which had installed the West Coast's first wood-fired pizza oven {{when it opened in}} 1935. [...] After traveling to Italy, Waters decided to make an open kitchen featuring a Tomasso's-style pizza oven the focus of the new cafe she was opening above her main dining room.

2500|$|While in Genoa, Nietzsche's failing {{eyesight}} {{prompted him}} to explore the use of typewriters {{as a means of}} continuing to write. He is known to have tried using the Hansen Writing Ball, a contemporary typewriter device. In the end, a past student of his, Heinrich Köselitz or Peter Gast, became a sort of private secretary to Nietzsche. In 1876, Gast transcribed the crabbed, nearly illegible handwriting of Nietzsche {{for the first time with}} Richard Wagner in Bayreuth. He subsequently transcribed and proofread the galleys for almost all of Nietzsche's work from then on. On at least one occasion on 23 February 1880, the usually broke Gast received 200 marks from their mutual friend, Paul Rée. Gast was one of the very few friends Nietzsche allowed to criticize him. In responding most enthusiastically to Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Gast did feel it necessary to point out that what were described as [...] "superfluous" [...] people were in fact quite necessary. He went on to list the number of people Epicurus, for example, had to rely on even to supply his simple diet of <b>goat</b> <b>cheese.</b>|$|E
60|$|A total abstainer, I had, I am {{thankful to}} say, {{strength}} enough {{to resist the}} temptation thus adroitly thrust upon me.

I also made signs I was hungry, and would be glad of something to eat. My gestures, as far as the blue ribbon went, must have been thrown away, of course, but any one could understand that I was fainting from hunger. The mistress of the house called to one of the spinning girls, who rose and went within the door opening from the platform at {{the upper end of the}} room. She presently returned with an old woman, a housekeeper, as we would say, and obviously a faithful and familiar servant.

There is a little fresh butter too--thirty or thirty-two francs the kilo. Most of the butter, however, is tinned in Milan. It costs the same as the fresh. There are splendid piles of salted black olives, and huge bowls of green salted olives. There are chickens and ducks and wild-fowl: at eleven and twelve and fourteen francs a kilo.
