40|$|An {{ensemble}} of typhoon events was examined to detect systematic skills and deficiencies of regional atmospheric models in dynamical downscaling these extreme weather phenomena from global reanalyses data. A regional atmospheric model hindcast was computed for the typhoon season 2004 for SE Asia {{and the western}} North Pacific. Global reanalyses data were dynamically downscaled to a grid resolution of about 50 km and in a double-nesting approach to 18 km. Simulated typhoon tracks and intensities were compared to best track data. The comparison revealed improved SLP and near-surface wind values by the RCM compared to the reanalyses for most cases. The reanalyses showed smaller <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>distances</b> to the best track data than the regional model. Precipitation patterns and rainfall amounts were simulated more realistically by the RCM using the higher resolution compared to the 50 km run. It is concluded that regional models can improve simulated typhoon developments from global forcing reanalyses data by giving lower core pressure and higher wind speeds and more realistic precipitation patterns even though these values still do not reach observed values...|$|R

The Hualien VIPIR ionosonde is a modern ionospheric radar, fully digitizing complex signal records and using multiple parallel receiver channels for simultaneous signal measurements from multiple spaced receiving antennas. This paper considers radio direction finding based on interferometric phase measurements from a horizontal antenna array in the Hualien VIPIR ionosonde system.

40|$|Lineations in {{the gravity}} {{field in the}} central Pacific Ocean have been {{explained}} by models of both small-scale convection and lithospheric boudinage. The boudinage model requires deformation of the plate and we have investigated bounds {{on the amount of}} deformation. We calculate separations between a pair of fracture zones on the Pacific plate which occur in an area where the lineations are well developed and compare these values to the separation of the corresponding fracture zone pair on the Nazca plate where no lineations have been observed. Satellite and surface-ship data was used to locate fracture zones and small circles were fitted to sections of picks which were chosen around their points of intersection with magnetic isochrons. <b>Great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>distances</b> from these small circles to stage poles were calculated and the difference between these distances gave the separations between the fracture zone pairs. We found that between anomalies 13 and 7 the difference in fracture zone spacing on the Pacific plate, compared to the Nazca plate, appears to increase as the age of oceanic lithosphere decreases. The maximum difference calculated was 97 km, about 4 % of the distance between the fracture zones, and we attribute this difference to the re-orientation of the ancient Pacific-Farallon spreading centre between anomalies 7 and 5. The main lithospheric stretching models require the fracture zone separation to increase with age but this is not seen in our results. © 1992...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the distance Mississippi patients must travel to access hospital-based emergency rooms (ERs) and to determine whether an association exists between geographic distance and ER utilization. To that end, <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>distances</b> between Census Block Group Centroid Points and 89 hospitals with emergency departments were calculated for the State of Mississippi. Data on the socio-demographic characteristics of each block group came from the 2000 US Census data. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to test if there was any association between ER utilization and travel distance. Compared to the national benchmark of 35. 7 %, more than one in two (56. 7 %), or 1, 612, 762 Mississippians visited ERs in 2003 with an estimated 6. 1 miles per person annual travel for this purpose. The majority of the target population (54. 9 %) was found to live within 5 miles of hospitals with ERs. Logistic analyses revealed that block groups associated with less miles traveled to hospitals with ERs had a higher proportion of African Americans, impoverished people, female householders, people with more than 12 years education, people older than 65 years, people with high median house values, and people without employment. Twenty-nine of the 89 hospitals (33 %) providing ER care in Mississippi were found to be in areas with above-average ER utilization rates. These hospitals served a smaller geographical area (28 % of the total) but had a greater proportion of visitors (57 %) and served a higher percentage (37 %) of the state population. People in areas served by the less utilized ERs traveled more miles to be cared for (7. 1 miles vs 5. 4 miles; p< 0. 0001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that shorter distances were associated with increased use of the ERs, even after controlling for socio-demographic factors. The conclusion is that Mississippi ERs are typically located in block groups with higher percentages of disadvantaged residents and that people in these areas are more likely to utilize ER services. Our data suggest that the geographical distance has an impact on ER utilization, especially by reducing utilization in disadvantaged block group areas. Disadvantaged persons living near ER hospitals (< 5 miles) were found to be more likely to utilize the ER services. Geographic distance should therefore be considered when planning state-wide ER programmes for disadvantaged populations...|$|R
