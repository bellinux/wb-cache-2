50|$|Channellock is an American {{company that}} {{produces}} hand tools. It {{is best known}} for its pliers—the company manufactures more than 140 types of pliers—particularly its eponymous style of tongue-and-groove, slip-joint pliers. Its pliers have distinctive sky-blue <b>handle</b> <b>grips</b> (see photo); the company has been using the same trademarked shade of blue since 1956.|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} that the user only leans on the robotic cart without {{operating}} the <b>handle</b> <b>grips,</b> all of the user’s weight becomes a load detected by the DFSs; thus, no signal is sensed by the FFSs or BFSs. Therefore, we can ensure that the robotic cart remains stationary by monitoring the value from the DFSs.|$|R
50|$|This type {{of rubber}} band was popularized by {{use in the}} military. Ranger bands are {{essentially}} sections of tire inner tubing cut into various sizes. They {{have the advantage of}} being versatile, durable, and resistant to weather and abrasion. They are commonly used for lashings, and can also be used for makeshift <b>handle</b> <b>grips,</b> providing a strong high-friction surface with excellent shock absorption.|$|R
5000|$|... 4th Model - The fourth model {{replaces the}} spur trigger with a {{familiar}} style trigger with trigger guard. The fourth model could {{be had in}} single or double action, {{and there was the}} option of a folder hammer spur. In addition to the saw <b>handle</b> <b>grip,</b> the bird's head or 'skull crusher' grip is available similar to the Pocket Army model. Two barrel sets are rare, but would typically consist of one each [...] inch and [...] inch barrels. A 'target' variant was sold in [...]32 long caliber with a seven-shot cylinder in addition to the more usual five-shot [...]38 M&H configuration.|$|E
50|$|The Stringbike is {{a bicycle}} {{that uses a}} rope and pulley drive system instead of a {{traditional}} bicycle chain and sprockets. It uses two Dyneema ropes attached to pulleys attached to swinging lever and cam mechanisms, {{one on each side}} of the bike. These mechanisms replace the round sprockets found on chain-driven bikes. Unlike some traditional 10-speed gears using a derailleur, there is no slippage when changing gear ratios. The Stringbike uses a 19 gear ratio system with no duplicates and a total gear range of 3.5 to 1. The transmission ratio can be changed with a shifting knob located on the right-side <b>handle</b> <b>grip.</b> Gear ratios can be changed even when the bicycle is almost stationary.|$|E
5000|$|In the American style, {{also called}} the zig-zag method or fork switching, the knife is {{initially}} held in the right hand and the fork in the left. Holding food to the plate with the fork tines-down, a single bite-sized piece is cut with the knife. The knife is then set down on the plate, the fork transferred from the left hand to the right hand, and the food is brought to the mouth for consumption. The fork is then transferred back to the left hand and the knife is picked up with the right. In contrast to the European hidden <b>handle</b> <b>grip,</b> in the American style the fork is held much like a spoon or pen once it is transferred to the right hand to convey food to the mouth. Though called [...] "American style", this style originated in Europe.|$|E

50|$|On 6 December 2014, Proton {{introduced}} the Suprima S Standard, a new base model variant which undercuts the Suprima S Executive {{by as much}} as RM6,900. The Suprima S Standard loses some equipment and trim, including several safety features, and offers several new, albeit downgraded components to achieve its lower pricing. The omissions include several interior components like the Android OS-powered Proton Infotainment System in favour of the more basic head-unit from the Proton Prevé Executive variant, as well as the lack of steering audio switches, YES 4G internet connectivity, and the rear lid on the floor console between the two front seats. On the exterior, the Suprima S loses the front foglights, engine cover and the black tape on the B-pillar sashes. The Suprima S Standard is fitted with the ten-spoke alloy rims first seen on the Proton Prevé, and not the hubcaps from the Proton Exora Bold Standard CFE as speculated from spyshots several days prior to the launch. The most significant omissions in the Suprima S Standard are its safety features; it is only equipped with dual front airbags, ABS and EBD, and is not equipped with side and curtain airbags, electronic stability control (ESC), traction control (TCS) and brake assist (BA), which are all offered in the Suprima S Executive. The anti-trap feature in the front power windows, front reactive headrest, driver-side overhead <b>handle</b> <b>grip</b> and seat belt reminder for the front passenger have also been omitted. Nonetheless, the Suprima S Standard comes with a new Panther Grey finish for the front dashboard panels and front position lamps which are of the bulb type, instead of the L.E.D. type on the Executive trim. The rest of the specifications, including the powertrain were left largely unchanged, and the Proton Suprima S Standard is priced at RM69,438 and RM69,888 for the solid and metallic paint options respectively, both on-the-road prices with insurance. Proton hopes to triple sales of the Suprima S with this new base model.|$|E
40|$|The {{reported}} {{flight controller}} features a <b>handle</b> <b>grip</b> which {{is mounted on}} a longitudinally extending control element. The <b>handle</b> <b>grip</b> is pivotally mounted on the control element about a pitch axis which is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis through the control element. The pivotal mounting includes a resilient force mounting mechanism which centers the grip relative to the control element. Rotation of the <b>handle</b> <b>grip</b> produces a direct rotation of a transducer element in a transducer which provides an electrical indication of the rotative movement about three mutually perpendicular axes...|$|E
30|$|We, then, {{carried out}} some {{measurement}} experiments {{to confirm the}} effectiveness of our proposed handling interface. In the measurement experiments, the participant (normal male age 23) operated the <b>handle</b> <b>grip</b> of the prototype robotic cart which is shown in Fig.  10. We measured the force signals detected by the FFS, BFS, and DFS when the participant moved {{in a straight line}} and only twisted the <b>handle</b> <b>grip</b> in the forward and backward directions.|$|E

30|$|The {{unintended}} motion {{such as the}} grasping sometimes causes misdetection {{because the}} force sensors fixed in the <b>handle</b> <b>grip</b> are pressed {{at the same instant}} by the grasping motion. Our proposed handling interface prevents such misdetection due to the grasping motion, which causes a malfunction, because the solid grip cover blocks the gripping forces, as shown in Fig.  7 (3). The twisting motion also sometimes causes similar misdetection. However, when the user twists the <b>handle</b> <b>grip,</b> as shown in Fig.  7 (4), the DFSs do not come in contact (or only come in slight contact) with the solid grip cover because of our proposed mechanical structure. Therefore, when the user twists the <b>handle</b> <b>grip,</b> the downward force sensed by the DFSs becomes smaller than the set threshold value. On the other hand, the FFSs and BFSs are pressed at the same time; thus, the sensors sense the pushing or pulling force applied to the <b>handle</b> <b>grip</b> as shown in Fig.  7 (4). Although the forces are detected, we can prevent the erroneous motion of the robotic cart because the downward force is smaller than the set threshold value.|$|E
30|$|The mobile robotic cart {{proposed}} {{in this study}} adopts the velocity control system to control the velocities of {{the left and right}} drive wheels according to the operating forces applied to the <b>handle</b> <b>grip</b> by the user as shown in Fig.  5.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} differences in swimming track start performances using side handle and front <b>handle</b> <b>grip</b> techniques and using an inclined platform at the rear of the starting platform. An instrumented starting block system was designed to allow front grip and side grip starting techniques and inclusion of a rear incline. Thirty male and 20 female junior elite swimmers completed three starts in each of four start block configurations: (1) Flat (traditional) block, front handle grip; (2) Flat (traditional) block, side handle grip; (3) Incline (new) block, front handle grip; (4) Incline (new) block, side <b>handle</b> <b>grip.</b> Force and video data were used to quantify parameters related to starting performance. Results indicated that use of side handles had a substantial impact on start performance while the effects of the rear incline were less pronounced. Compared to using a front grip technique, use of the side handles increased horizontal velocity at takeoff up to 18 %, resulted in a more horizontal takeoff angle by up to 2 °, increased contribution to horizontal impulse from arms up to 12 %, increased peak horizontal power up to 28 %, decreased time to 6 m by 4 % and increased velocity at 6 m by 2. 5 %. These advantages were achieved at a cost of an 8 % increase in propulsion time. Based on this study, w...|$|E

30|$|The average pushing force {{required}} {{to operate the}} wheeled walker was 15  N, as shown in Fig.  16 a, when the participant walked up the slope. On the other hand, the average operating force for the prototype robotic cart was 5.5  N as shown in Fig.  16 b. Also, the operating forces added to the <b>handle</b> <b>grips</b> became zero when the participant temporarily stopped during the operation, as shown in Fig.  16 b {{because there was no}} need to push the prototype robotic cart. In contrast, the pushing forces added to the wheeled walker remained over 5  N during the operation to maintain its stationary state as shown in Fig.  16 a.|$|R
