40|$|Internet web {{browsing}} {{has reached}} a critical tipping point. Increasingly, users rely more on mobile web browsers to ac-cess the Internet than desktop browsers. Meanwhile, webpages {{over the past decade}} have grown in complexity by more than tenfold. The fast penetration of mobile browsing and ever-richer webpages implies a growing need for high-performance mobile devices in the future to ensure continued end-user browsing experience. Failing to deliver webpages meeting hard cut-off constraints could directly translate to webpage abandonment or, for e-commerce websites, great revenue loss. However, mobile devices â€™ limited battery capacity limits the degree of performance that mobile web browsing can achieve. In this paper, we demonstrate the benefits of heterogeneous systems with big/little cores each with different frequencies to achieve the ideal trade-off between high performance and en-ergy efficiency. Through detailed characterizations of different webpage primitives based on the hottest 5, 000 webpages, we build statistical inference models that estimate webpage load time and energy consumption. We show that leveraging such predictive models lets us identify and schedule webpages us-ing the ideal core and frequency configuration that minimizes energy consumption while still meeting stringent cut-off con-straints. Real hardware and software evaluations show that our scheduling scheme achieves 83. 0 % energy savings, while only violating the cut-off latency for 4. 1 % more webpages as compared with a performance-oriented <b>hardware</b> <b>strategy.</b> Against a more intelligent, OS-driven, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling scheme, it achieves 8. 6 % energy savings and 4. 0 % performance improvement simultaneously. 1...|$|E

40|$|Artificial neural {{networks}} (ANN) offer tremendous promise in classifying electrocardiogram (ECG) for detection and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. In this thesis, we propose a reusable neuron architecture (RNA) to enable an efficient and cost-effective ANN-based ECG processing by multiplexing the same physical neurons for both feed-forward and back-propagation stages. RNA further conserves {{the area and}} resources of the chip and reduces power dissipation by coalescing different layers of the neural network into a single layer. Moreover, the microarchitecture of each RNA neuron has been optimized to maximize the degree of hardware reusability by fusing multiple two-input multipliers and a multi-input adder into one two-input multiplier and one two-input adder. With RNA, we demonstrated a hardware implementation of a three-layer 51 - 30 - 12 artificial neural network using only thirty physical RNA neurons. A quantitative design space exploration in area, power dissipation, and speed between the proposed RNA and three other implementations representative of different reusable <b>hardware</b> <b>strategies</b> is presented and discussed.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2002 This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of an embedded controller that {{is used for the}} Vehicle Navigation Unit (VNU) prototypes that are being developed at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF). The goal of the VNU project is to develop a system that will measure relative position and provide wireless communication between four identical vehicles without the use of GPS signals. Each VNU consists of an antenna and phase detector array, embedded controller, radio modem magnetometer, and a diagnostic computer. The main focus of this thesis is the design and implementation of the embedded controller hardware and software that integrates all the VNU components into an operational system. The embedded controller utilizes the Motorola MC 68 HC 711 E 9 microcontroller and the Zilog Z 85230 Serial Communication Controller that receives and transmits the data serially. The relative distance and bearing between VNUs is estimated by measuring the angle of arrival and received signal strength of the radio frequency packets transmitted by each VNU. The magnetometer is used to monitor the horizontal orientation of the VNU and to serve as a fixed referencefor comparing the relative bearing between vehicles. These raw measurements are archived into a diagnostic computer, which estimates the relative position between the VNUs and provides a graphical representation. These VNU prototypes are designed for ideal environments and are intended to provide a test bed for evaluating signal processing and <b>hardware</b> <b>strategies</b> for mitigating multipath effects. The complete VNU design is presented, started with a functional block diagram of the hardware and software, and concluding with operational tests that demonstrate the performance of the fully integrated prototype...|$|R
