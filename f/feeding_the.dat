On April Fools Day—the date Arkham's family was murdered—Cavendish released the patients and lured Batman to the asylum, believing him to be the bat Arkham spoke of. Cavendish accuses him of <b>feeding</b> <b>the</b> evil of the asylum by bringing it more insane souls. Batman attempts to convince Cavendish he is sick and needs treatment, but Cavendish responds by attacking him. Batman and Cavendish proceed to struggle, which ends after Adams slashes Cavendish's throat with the razor.|$|E

5|$|Antbirds are monogamous, mate for life, {{and defend}} territories. They usually lay two {{eggs in a}} nest that is either {{suspended}} from branches or supported on a branch, stump, or mound on the ground.

5|$|Balaenopterids are the rorquals. These animals, {{along with}} the cetotheriids, rely on their throat pleats to gulp large amounts of water while <b>feeding.</b> <b>The</b> throat pleats extend from the mouth to the navel and allow the mouth to expand to a large volume for more {{efficient}} capture of the small animals they feed on. Balaenopterids consist of two genera and eight species.|$|E

5|$|Helpers, {{offspring}} {{from the}} previous brood, have sometimes been noted to assist in <b>feeding</b> <b>the</b> fledglings at the nest of their parents.

5|$|In some countries, geese {{and ducks}} are force-fed to produce livers with an {{exceptionally}} high fat {{content for the}} production of foie gras. Over 75% of world production of this product occurs in France, with lesser industries in Hungary and Bulgaria and a growing production in China.

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19thcentury, the USACE dredged {{channels}} and built locks and levees in the Willamette's watershed. Although products such as lumber were often transported on an existing network of railroads in Oregon, these advances in navigation helped businesses deliver more goods to Portland, <b>feeding</b> <b>the</b> city's growing economy. Trade goods from the Columbia basin north of Portland could also be transported southward on the Willamette due to the deeper channels made at the Willamette's mouth.|$|E

5|$|It is a migratory {{passerine}} which {{winters in}} southern and western Europe, southern Asia and north Africa. Greenish-brown above and off-white below, it is named onomatopoeically for its simple chiff-chaff song. It {{has a number}} of subspecies, some of which are now treated as full species. The female builds a domed nest on or near the ground, and assumes most of the responsibility for brooding and <b>feeding</b> <b>the</b> chicks, whilst the male has little involvement in nesting, but defends his territory against rivals, and attacks potential predators.|$|E
5|$|Male {{care for}} infants has been {{documented}} in ruffed lemur societies. During early development, adult males may guard the nests of multiple core group females, as well as help care for the infants that were likely fathered by other males. During the season when females practice infant stashing, males effectively lighten the reproductive burden of up to several mothers by guarding, huddling, grooming, travelling, playing with and <b>feeding</b> <b>the</b> young.|$|E
5|$|Multiple eruptions of silica-rich {{rhyolite}} from 40,000 to 600 {{years ago}} built the Mono Craters.

5|$|The family Hirundinidae is a {{group of}} passerines characterised by their {{adaptation}} to aerial <b>feeding.</b> <b>The</b> family includes swallows and martins. These adaptations include a slender streamlined body, long pointed wings, and short bills with a wide gape. The feet are adapted to perching rather than walking, and the front toes are partially joined at the base.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight is}} weak-looking and {{resembles that of}} a bat, with {{fluttering}} interspersed with short glides. When <b>feeding,</b> <b>the</b> birds hang with raised wings and patter on the surface with their feet, but, unlike the Wilson's storm petrel, do not {{look as if they}} are walking on the water. Birds will sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} browses {{primarily}} at dusk or at dawn, and {{is associated with}} the gerenuk and the impala.

It eats succulent plants, such as the wild sisal, Sansevieria, and Euphorbia species in the dry season, and drinks water when sources are available.|$|E
