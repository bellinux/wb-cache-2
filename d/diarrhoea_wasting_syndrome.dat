40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} WHO clinical stage 3 and 4 conditions during early anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in resource limited settings (RLS). DESIGN/SETTING: A descriptive analysis of routine program data collected prospectively from 25 Médecins Sans Frontières supported HIV treatment programs in eight countries between 2002 and 2010. SUBJECTS/PARTICIPANTS: 35, 349 study participants with median follow-up on ART of 1. 33 years (IQR 0. 51 - 2. 41). OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence in 100 person-years of WHO stage 3 or 4 conditions during 5 periods after ART initiation. Diagnoses of conditions were made according to WHO criteria and relied upon clinical assessments supported by basic laboratory investigations. RESULTS: The incidence of any WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 condition over 3 years was 40. 02 per 100 person-years (31. 77 for stage 3 and 8. 25 for stage 4). The incidence of stage 3 and 4 conditions fell by over 97 % between months 0 - 3 and months 25 - 36 (77. 81 to 2. 40 for stage 3 and 28. 70 to 0. 64 for stage 4). During months 0 - 3 pulmonary tuberculosis {{was the most common}} condition diagnosed in adults (incidence 22. 24 per 100 person-years) and children aged 5 - 14 years (25. 76) and oral candidiasis was the most common in children < 5 years (25. 79). Overall incidences were higher in Africa compared with Asia (43. 98 versus 12. 97 for stage 3 and 8. 98 versus 7. 05 for stage 4 conditions, p< 0. 001). Pulmonary tuberculosis, weight loss, oral and oesophageal candidiasis, chronic <b>diarrhoea,</b> HIV <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> and severe bacterial infections were more common in Africa. Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection, cryptococcosis, penicilliosis and toxoplasmosis were more common in Asia. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of WHO stage 3 and 4 conditions during the early period after ART initiation in RLS is high, but greatly reduces over time. This is likely due to both the benefits of ART and deaths of the sickest patients occurring shortly after ART initiation. Access to appropriate disease prevention tools prior to ART, and early initiation of ART, are important for their prevention...|$|R

40|$|Myostatin is {{the main}} {{negative}} regulator of skeletal muscle growth. AIM:To investigate {{the contribution of the}} myostatin in wasting of MDS patients. MATERIALS: Eighty-one(51 males and 30 females),MDS patients(median age 71,range 33 - 85), and 17 age and sex matched healthy were included. All gave informed consent. METHODS:RNA was extracted from left arm muscle. RT-PCR and Real time PCR were used with actin gene as reference gene. Mutation analysis was performed by direct sequencing. Serum levels of TNFa, IL- 1, IL- 2, Il- 6, TGF-β and leptin were measured using ELISA. Muscle cells were grown under varying quantities of cytokines and the myostatin RNA was determined. RESULTS: Myostatin RNA was higher in patients with RA,RAEB,RAEB-T in comparison to CMML,RARS and healthy controls. Patients with <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> had significantly higher copies of myostatin RNA(46997. 45 ± 8934. 09) compared to the patients without <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> (10702. 97 ± 3885. 59) (p 1 = 0. 00102) and healthy individuals (12657. 12 ± 3231. 873) (p 2 = 0. 000512). Patients without <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> did not differ statistically from healthy controls(p 3 = 0. 52). Mutations or polymorphisms in the myostatin gene were not found. TNF-α level in MDS patients with <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> was higher(p 1 = 0. 0047, p 2 = 0. 0191) and so was IL- 1 (p 1 = 0. 000114, p 2 = 1. 7546 x 10 - 8). H IL- 6 in MDS patients with <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> was also higher(p 1 = 0. 0103, p 2 = 0. 0267). TGF-β was higher in MDS patients with <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> compared to the controls(p 2 = 1. 09182 x 10 - 5). IL- 2 in the 1 st group was higher than the 2 d(p 1 = 0. 0478) and the 3 d(p 2 = 4. 48915 x 10 - 7). As well as myostatin in the 1 st group compared to the 2 d and 3 d(p 1 = 0. 0011,p 2 = 0. 0373). Leptin was also higher in the 1 st group compared to the 2 d and 3 d(p 1 = 3. 378 x 10 - 10, p 2 = 1. 97 · 10 - 8). TNF-α in concentrations > 500 ng/ml causes overexpression of the myostatin gene in cultures of human muscle cells and therefore it may participate through this pathway in the appearance of the <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome.</b> We cannot exclude the action of TNF-α through another mechanism. The other cutokines did not change the myostatin expression. CONCLUSIONS: We found 1) increased expression of myostatin in MDS patients with <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome.</b> 2) increased levels of TNF-α, TGF-β IL- 1, IL- 2, IL- 6 and leptin in the serum of the same group of patients 3) Indication of activation of the myostatin gene from the TNF-α. Further study with inhibitors of these cytokines will confirm this hypothesis. ...|$|R
40|$|Melissa E Badowski, 1 Sarah E Perez 2 1 Department of Pharmacy Practice, Section of Infectious Diseases Pharmacotherapy, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA; 2 Infectious Diseases Clinic, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA Abstract: Since the {{beginning}} of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, weight loss has been a common complaint for patients. The use of various definitions defining HIV <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> has made it difficult to determine its actual prevalence. Despite the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy, it is estimated that the prevalence of HIV <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> is between 14 % and 38 %. HIV <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> may stem from conditions affecting chewing, swallowing, or gastrointestinal motility, neurologic disease affecting food intake or the perception of hunger or ability to eat, psychiatric illness, food insecurity generated from psychosocial or economic concerns, or anorexia due to medications, malabsorption, infections, or tumors. Treatment of HIV <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> may be managed with appetite stimulants (megestrol acetate or dronabinol), anabolic agents (testosterone, testosterone analogs, or recombinant human growth hormone), or, rarely, cytokine production modulators (thalidomide). The goal of this review is to provide an in-depth evaluation based on existing clinical trials on the clinical utility of dronabinol in the treatment of weight loss associated with HIV/AIDS. Although total body weight gain varies with dronabinol use (– 2. 0 to 3. 2 kg), dronabinol is a well-tolerated option to promote appetite stimulation. Further studies are needed with standardized definitions of HIV-associated weight loss and clinical outcomes, robust sample sizes, safety and efficacy data on chronic use of dronabinol beyond 52 weeks, and associated virologic and immunologic outcomes.

40|$|Abstract. Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV 2) is {{the cause}} of postweaning {{multisystemic}} <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PMWS). The most common lesions of PMWS are lymphohistiocytic to granulomatous lymphadenitis, interstitial pneumonia and interstitial nephritis, with intracytoplasmic amphophilic botryoid inclusion bodies in macrophages. In addition to these typical changes, intracytoplasmic botryoid inclusion bodies were observed in bronchial, bronchial glandular, and renal tubular epithelium of several pigs from 4 different farms in Western and Eastern Canada. PCV 2 inclusion bodies were demonstrated to be located in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells by immunohistochemical staining for PCV 2 and cytokeratin antigens and by ultrastructural demonstration of viral particles in the inclusion bodies within renal tubular epithelium. Key words: Intracytoplasmic epithelial inclusion bodies; porcine circovirus 2 (PCV 2); postweaning multisystemic <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PMWS).

40|$|Abstract Background Inhibin is a tumor-suppressor and activin antagonist. Inhibin-deficient mice develop gonadal tumors and a {{cachexia}} <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> due to enhanced activin signaling. Because activins signal through SMAD 2 and SMAD 3 {{in vitro}} {{and loss of}} SMAD 3 attenuates ovarian tumor development in inhibin-deficient females, we sought to determine the role of SMAD 2 {{in the development of}} ovarian tumors originating from the granulosa cell lineage. Methods Using an inhibin α null mouse model and a conditional knockout strategy, double conditional knockout mice of Smad 2 and inhibin alpha were generated in the current study. The survival rate and development of gonadal tumors and the accompanying cachexia <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome</b> were monitored. Results Nearly identical to the controls, the Smad 2 and inhibin alpha double knockout mice succumbed to weight loss, aggressive tumor progression, and death. Furthermore, elevated activin levels and activin-induced pathologies in the liver and stomach characteristic of inhibin deficiency were also observed in these mice. Our results indicate that SMAD 2 ablation does not protect inhibin-deficient females from the development of ovarian tumors or the cachexia <b>wasting</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Conclusions SMAD 2 is not required for mediating tumorigenic signals of activin in ovarian tumor development caused by loss of inhibin. </p...|$|R
