25|$|The film is grandiose, horrible, showing monstrous crimes...regrettably, {{the film}} {{people here are}} putting me under {{pressure}} to finish {{the whole thing in}} ten days even though the film is barely finished. I hope I can get it all together. I'm living here like a monk, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> at 8 in the evening, eat and drink very little and don't feel at all at ease in this giant city with all the responsibility for the film.|$|E
500|$|Mars' {{music has}} been noted for {{displaying}} {{a wide variety of}} styles, musical genres, and influences, including pop, rock, reggae, R, soul, and hip hop. His debut album Doo-Wops & Hooligans, a pop record, is influence by these genres. His subsequent release, Unorthodox Jukebox, as with his debut album, is infused with different influences including dance, rock reggae and soul, as well as balladry. Lyrically, the album is different than the former, addressing traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality. The explicit content in the song [...] "Gorilla" [...] caused a controversy in Australia. Many of his songs, particularly on Doo-Wops & Hooligans, reflect [...] "feel-good", carefree, and optimistic sentiments. However, darker subjects are addressed in his songs, detailing failed relationships and self-destructive behaviour. Mars' third album, 24K Magic, is significantly influence by R, soul music and funk. Lyrically, the album involve themes of money and sex. Mars has explained his writing process: [...] "I don't sit down and think, 'I'm going to write a song', inspiration hits me always unexpectedly: on a plane, when I'm out or just before <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> An idea will suddenly come to my mind, and sometimes I manage to turn it into lyrics the next day. Sometimes it'll take me one year to get something real out of it. You can’t force creativeness." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, DeVille {{relocated}} from New York to New Orleans, {{where he}} found a spiritual home. [...] "I was stunned", {{he said in a}} 1993 interview. [...] "I had the feeling that I was going back home. It was very strange... I live in the French Quarter, two streets away from Bourbon Street; at night, when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> I hear the boogie that comes from the streets, and in the morning, when I wake up, I hear the blues." ...|$|E

2500|$|A host {{of local}} campesinos went on record to journalists from The Guardian about this {{phenomenon}} as well. Melanio Moscoso, of La Higuera stated [...] "we pray to him, {{we are so}} proud he had died here, in La Higuera, fighting for us. We feel him so close", while Freddy Vallejos, of Vallegrande, proclaimed [...] "we have a faith, a confidence in Che. When <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> and when I wake up, I first pray to God and then I pray to Che – and then, everything is all right. Che's presence here is a positive force. I feel it in my skin, I have faith that always, at all times, he has an eye on us." [...] Remi Calzadilla, a resident of Pucara, claimed that praying to Che had helped him regain the ability to walk, adding that [...] "now every time I speak to Che I {{feel a strong force}} inside of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The song title [...] "Yellow Ledbetter" [...] {{is derived}} from the actual name of an old friend of Vedder from Chicago, named Tim Ledbetter. Although many fans have made their own interpretations of the song, a common theory has been that the song is about someone {{receiving}} a letter and finding his or her brother had died overseas in war, cited from the lyrics in the Live at the Garden version [...] "I don't know whether my brother will be coming home in a box or a bag." [...] On the official bootleg release of 5/3/03 - State College, Pennsylvania, Vedder sings [...] "I'd like to wish this war away, and I tried, but it just, just don't happen, don't happen that way/And my brother...they sent him off to fight for the flag. I just, I don't hope he comes home in a box or a bag", and [...] "And I know that he's just following his path. As long, as long as it's not a box or a bag." [...] On the official bootleg release of 7/11/03 - Mansfield, Massachusetts, Vedder sings in the first verse [...] "I think of him when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> and he's coming home in a box or a bag." [...] It's widely known that Vedder changes the lyrics of the song when singing it live, so it's difficult to know if what he's singing at the time are the original lyrics from 1991.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{tell you}} what,' said Benjamin, taking down a lantern. 'I'll {{have a look}} round, before <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> myself, for satisfaction's sake. Undo the door while I light this, Clemmy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't overdo it, dear; that's all. But, Frank, I {{could not}} rest if <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> without {{speaking}} <b>to</b> you. You made me unhappy to-day." ...|$|R
60|$|All this {{happened}} yesterday evening. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> sadly dissatisfied with somebody. Was it with Oscar? or with myself? or with both? I fancy with both.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> in a vile humor, {{and slept}} badly; wondering, {{in the long}} wakeful hours, what new rebuff I should meet with on the next day.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thank you," [...] {{said the}} elder, [...] "I don't propose sitting up all night, and you'll excuse me if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> now. It's a little {{informal}} {{to leave a}} guest--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I myself;" [...] he explained--"I {{rise from}} breakfast feeling eager for my lunch. I {{get up from}} my lunch looking forward to my dinner. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> just ready for my breakfast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} in that. When <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> I generally dream of being caught and dragged to prison. And those men always wanted me to drink, and I don't care much for liquor." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{meant to}} write to you last night, but to enable Wills to get away I had {{to read a book}} of Fitzgerald's through before <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|R
60|$|I left Jacky peeking {{still and}} <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> After {{a long time}} Aunt Tommy came {{up to my room}} and sat down on my bed in the moonlight.|$|R
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> The {{hotel was}} {{on the edge of}} a steep declivity. I {{wondered}} why the whole hills did not slide down, in some great natural catastrophe.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{no chance}} {{for me to have}} any horrid dreams," [...] lamented Sara Ray, [...] "because ma won't let me having {{anything}} at all to eat before <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> I don't think it's fair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A future prima donna," [...] she retorted, [...] "can't do {{always what}} she likes. If <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> too early I cannot sleep. To-night I am excited and nervous. There isn't {{anything}} {{likely to bring}} trouble upon--them, is there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Unless <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> early I get {{practically}} no sleep at all," [...] Mrs. Paley was heard to explain, {{as if to}} justify her seizure of Susan, who got up and proceeded to wheel the chair to the door.|$|E
60|$|That was {{an uncomfortable}} hour; {{for there was}} a big {{audience}} on the hurricane deck. When <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> that night, <b>I</b> killed Brown in seventeen different ways--all of them new.|$|R

60|$|However, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> {{and slept}} on it. Next morning I {{determined}} {{to set out}} for Southampton {{on a tour of}} inquiry to all the steamboat agencies. If that failed, <b>I</b> could <b>go</b> on <b>to</b> Plymouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not to-night. Four {{nights a}} week <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> early {{and this is one}} of them. Let's escape, if we can, before Mr. Miller can make his way over here. I know he'll try and have coffee with us or something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} turn in now, for I suppose {{you will be}} {{starting}} early, and I {{have two or three}} patients I must visit again before <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> This is your room, next to mine. I managed, after all, to get it changed." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, yes, I {{heard them}} scampering soon after <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> but <b>I</b> {{thought it was}} kittens at play in the room overhead, and soon <b>went</b> <b>to</b> sleep. But they don't come into the rooms, do they?" ...|$|R
6000|$|So <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> in her arms, {{and cried}} myself to sleep, {{thinking}} with my latest breath, in a tremor of horror, that I'd found it at last. Courtenay Ivor {{was the name}} of my father's murderer! ...|$|R
