5|$|Normal {{coagulation}} is {{initiated by}} the release of tissue factor from damaged tissue. Tissue factor binds to circulating factor VIIa. The combination activates factor X to factor Xa and <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> to factor IXa. Factor Xa (in the presence of factor V) activates prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin is a central enzyme in the coagulation process: it generates fibrin from fibrinogen, and activates {{a number of other}} enzymes and cofactors (factor XIII, factor XI, factor V and factor VIII, TAFI) that enhance the fibrin clot. The process is inhibited by TFPI (which inactivates the first step catalyzed by factor VIIa/tissue factor), antithrombin (which inactivates thrombin, factor IXa, Xa and XIa), protein C (which inhibits factors Va and VIIIa in the presence of protein S), and protein Z (which inhibits factor Xa).|$|E

40|$|AbstractProtein Z is a vitamin K-dependent {{plasma protein}} of unknown function. Its modular {{structure}} is identical {{with those of}} <b>factors</b> VII, <b>IX,</b> X, and protein C. These proteins have an N-terminal γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) -containing module which binds six to ten Ca 2 +. In <b>factors</b> <b>IX,</b> X, and protein C, the adjacent epidermal growth factor (EGF) -like module binds one Ca 2 + whereas the EGF-like module in protein Z does not. We have compared the Ca 2 + binding properties of a fragment of protein Z comprising the Gla and N-terminal EGF-like modules (pZ-GlaEGFN) with those of intact protein Z and the isolated Gla module by measuring the Ca 2 +-induced quenching of the intrinsic protein fluorescence. The similar Ca 2 + affinities of pZ-GlaEGFN and protein Z indicate that pZ-GlaEGFN has a native conformation and normal Ca 2 + binding properties. A comparison of the Ca 2 + binding to pZ-GlaEGFN with those to the corresponding fragments of <b>factors</b> <b>IX,</b> X, and protein C indicate that Ca 2 + binding to the N-terminal EGF-like modules in the latter proteins does not influence the folding and Ca 2 + binding properties of their Gla modules. Furthermore, the Ca 2 +-induced fluorescence enhancements of GlaEGF fragments from <b>factors</b> <b>IX,</b> X, and protein C appear {{to be caused by}} Ca 2 + binding to the site in the EGF-like modules since it is not observed for pZ-GlaEGFN...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{endothelial cell}} is {{considered}} antithrombogenic, endothelium {{has recently been}} shown to participate in procoagulant reactions. In this report cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells are shown to propagate a procoagulant pathway starting with factor XIa, leading to activation of <b>factors</b> <b>IX,</b> VIII, X, and prothrombin, culminating in fibrinopeptide A cleavage from fibrinogen and formation of a fibrin clot. Electron microscopic studies demonstrated that fibrin strands are {{closely associated with the}} endothelial cells. Endotoxin-treated endothelial cells, having acquired tissue factor activity, generated fibrinopeptide A in the presence of <b>factors</b> VIIa, <b>IX,</b> VIII, X, prothrombin, and fibrinogen. Factor X activation by factor VIIa and tissue factor expressed by endothelial cells is 10 times greater in the presence of <b>factors</b> <b>IX</b> and VIII than in their absence. This indicates that on the perturbed endothelial cell surface, <b>factors</b> <b>IX</b> and VIII do have {{an important role in the}} activation of factor X. Addition of platelets (10 (8) per ml) augmented thrombin formation seen in the presence of endothelium alone by about 15 -fold. Anti-human factor V IgG decreased this enhanced thrombin formation in the presence of platelets, indicating that factor V from platelets was playing an important role in thrombin formation. These data lead us to propose that endothelial cells can actively participate in procoagulant reactions. Although platelets can augment thrombin formation by these endothelial cell-dependent reactions, endothelial cells alone can lead to formation of a cell-associated fibrin clot. The endotoxin-treated endothelial cell provides a model of the thrombotic state supplying tissue factor to initiate coagulation and propagating the reactions leading to fibrin formation. This endothelial cell-dependent pathway suggests a central role for <b>factors</b> VIII and <b>IX</b> consistent with their importance in hemostasis...|$|R
25|$|The {{physiological}} target proteases of antithrombin {{are those}} of the contact activation pathway (formerly known as the intrinsic pathway), namely the activated forms of Factor X (Xa), <b>Factor</b> <b>IX</b> (IXa), Factor XI (XIa), Factor XII (XIIa) and, to a greater extent, Factor II (thrombin) (IIa), and also the activated form of Factor VII (VIIa) from the tissue factor pathway (formerly known as the extrinsic pathway). The inhibitor also inactivates kallikrein and plasmin , also involved in blood coagulation. However it inactivates certain other serine proteases that are not involved in coagulation such as trypsin and the C1s subunit of the enzyme C1 involved in the classical complement pathway.|$|E

25|$|In DIC, the {{processes}} of coagulation and fibrinolysis are dysregulated, {{and the result is}} widespread clotting with resultant bleeding. Regardless of the triggering event of DIC, once initiated, the pathophysiology of DIC is similar in all conditions. One critical mediator of DIC is the release of a transmembrane glycoprotein called tissue factor (TF). TF is present on the surface of many cell types (including endothelial cells, macrophages, and monocytes) and is not normally in contact with the general circulation, but is exposed to the circulation after vascular damage. For example, TF is released in response to exposure to cytokines (particularly interleukin 1), tumor necrosis factor, and endotoxin. This {{plays a major role in}} the development of DIC in septic conditions. TF is also abundant in tissues of the lungs, brain, and placenta. This helps to explain why DIC readily develops in patients with extensive trauma. Upon exposure to blood and platelets, TF binds with activated factor VIIa (normally present in trace amounts in the blood), forming the extrinsic tenase complex. This complex further activates <b>factor</b> <b>IX</b> and X to IXa and Xa, respectively, leading to the common coagulation pathway and the subsequent formation of thrombin and fibrin.|$|E

40|$|Coagulation factor XI is a {{glycoprotein}} of {{the contact}} factor system. Its deficiency {{is associated with}} a highly variable bleeding tendency, thus a role in relation to hemostasis appears to exist. However, the importance of factor XI for stimulating intrinsic coagulation in vivo has not yet been determined. To study the procoagulant effects of human factor XIa in vivo, we infused the purified enzyme into normal chimpanzees (100 micrograms) in the absence or presence of the thrombin inhibitor rec-hirudin (1. 0 mg/kg loading dose plus 0. 3 mg/kg body wt continuous infusion). Factor XIa elicited an immediate activation of <b>factors</b> <b>IX,</b> X, and prothrombin, as measured by their respective activation fragments. However, whereas the activation of <b>factors</b> <b>IX</b> and X was immediate and shortlasting, (peak increments of 6 - and 1. 4 -fold of baseline at 5 minutes after injection), the conversion of prothrombin gradually increased, reaching a summit of 6 -fold baseline values after 60 min, and remaining elevated {{during the course of the}} experiments. Thrombin-antithrombin complexes also remained elevated during the study period. In the presence of hirudin, the initial activation of <b>factors</b> <b>IX,</b> X, and prothrombin was unchanged, however the further increment in prothrombin fragment F 1 + 2 was markedly inhibited.

25|$|Estrogens affect liver protein {{synthesis}} and thereby influence the cardiovascular system.

Although this is true for oral estrogen, transdermal estradiol has been found only to reduce PAI-1 and protein S, {{and to a lesser extent}} than oral estrogen. Due to its effects on liver {{protein synthesis}}, oral estrogen is procoagulant, and has been found to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Conversely, modern oral contraceptives are not associated with an increase in the risk of stroke and myocardial infarction (heart attack) in healthy, non-smoking premenopausal women of any age, except in those with hypertension (high blood pressure). However, a small but significant increase in the risk of stroke, though not of myocardial infarction, has been found in menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy.
