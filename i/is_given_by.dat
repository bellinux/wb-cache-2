40|$|We {{know that}} for a finite field $F$, every {{function}} on $F$ can <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>by</b> a polynomial with coefficients in $F$. What about the converse? i. e. if $R$ is a ring (not necessarily commutative or with unity) such that every function on $R$ can <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>by</b> a polynomial with coefficients in $R$, can we say $R$ is a finite field ? We show {{that the answer is}} yes, and that in fact it is enough to only require that all bijections <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>by</b> polynomials. If we allow our rings to have unity, we show that the property that all characteristic functions can <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>by</b> polynomials actually characterizes finite fields and if we moreover allow our rings to be commutative, then to characterize finite fields, it is enough that some special characteristic function <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>by</b> a polynomial (with coefficients even in some extension ring). Motivated by this, we determine all commutative rings with unity which admits a characteristic function which can <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>by</b> some polynomial with coefficients in the ring.
