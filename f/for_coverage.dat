5|$|More than 9.2 {{million people}} {{signed up for}} care on the {{national}} exchange (healthcare.gov) for 2017, down some 400,000 from 2016. This decline was due primarily to the election of President Trump, who pulled advertising encouraging people to sign up <b>for</b> <b>coverage,</b> issued an executive order that attempts to eliminate the mandate, and has created significant uncertainty {{about the future of}} the ACA. Enrollments had been running ahead of 2016 prior to President Obama leaving office, with 9.8 million expected to sign-up, so President Trump's actions potentially cost about 600,000 national enrollments (i.e., 9.8 million expected − 9.2 million actual = 0.6 million impact). Of the 9.2 million, 3.0 million were new customers and 6.2 million were returning. The 9.2 million excludes the 11 states that run their own exchanges, which have signed up around 3 million additional people. These figures also exclude the additional coverage due to the Medicaid expansion, which covers another approximately 10 million persons, as described in the impact section above.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of hydrogen with the Cu(100) surface {{has been investigated}} {{using a variety of}} experimental probes. As there is an activation barrier for the dissociative adsorption of molecular hydrogen on copper, hot-tungsten-filament hydrogen dosers were utilized to effect adsorption on the surface. Nuclear reaction analysis (NRA), with deuterium substituted for hydrogen, was employed to make quantitative measurements of the adsorbate coverage. To generate a phase diagram for the H/Cu(100) system, the hydrogen coverage was correlated with low energy electron diffraction (LEED) observations and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) spectra. <b>For</b> <b>coverages</b> greater than 0. 35 ML, three hydrogen induced surface reconstructions were observed: (i) a p(2 x 1) +anti-phase domain structure <b>for</b> <b>coverages</b> between 0. 35 and 0. 75 ML, (ii) a metastable (22 x 22) R 45 ∘ structure at 0. 75 ML, and (iii) a (42 x 22) R 45 ∘ structure <b>for</b> <b>coverages</b> between 0. 75 and 1. 00 ML. Electron energy loss spectroscopy was employed to investigate the adsorbate vibrational modes. <b>For</b> <b>coverages</b> < 0. 75 ML, hydrogen was determined to be located in the surface four fold hollow site. In order to explain the observed loss spectra at coverages 3 ̆e 0. 75 ML, the associated (42 x 22) R 45 ∘ reconstruction is postulated to be of the missing row type, with 25...|$|R
