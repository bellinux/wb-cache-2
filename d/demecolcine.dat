Recent study has found at higher concentration Colcemid can promote microtubule detachment from microtubule organizing center.

50|$|Several {{experiments}} {{show that}} the biosynthesis of colchicine involves the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine as precursors. Indeed, the feeding of C. autumnale with radioactive amino acid, tyrosine-2-C14, caused the latter to partially incorporate in the ring system of colchicine. The induced absorption of radioactive phenylalanine-2-C14 by C. byzantinum, another plant of the Colchicaceae family, resulted in its efficient absorption by colchicine. However, it was proven that the tropolone ring of colchicine resulted, in essence, from {{the expansion of the}} tyrosine ring. Further radioactive feeding experiments of C. autumnale revealed that colchicine can be synthesized biosynthetically from (S)-autumnaline. That biosynthesic pathway occurs primarily through a para-para phenolic coupling reaction involving the intermediate isoandrocymbine. The resulting molecule undergoes O-methylation directed by S-adenosylmethionine. Two oxidation steps followed by the cleavage of the cyclopropane ring leads to the formation of the tropolone ring contained by N-formyldemecolcine. N-formyldemecolcine hydrolyzes then to generate the molecule <b>demecolcine,</b> which also goes through an oxidative demethylation that generates deacetylcolchicine. The molecule of colchicine appears finally after addition of acetyl-coenzyme A to deacetylcolchicine.|$|E
50|$|Cytoskeletal {{drugs are}} small {{molecules}} that interact with actin or tubulin. These drugs can {{act on the}} cytoskeletal components within a cell in three main ways. Some cytoskeletal drugs stabilize {{a component of the}} cytoskeleton, such as taxol which stabilizes microtubules or Phalloidin which stabilizes actin filaments. Others such as Cytochalasin D bind to actin monomers and prevent them from polymerizing into filaments. Drugs such as <b>demecolcine</b> act by enhancing the depolymerisation of already formed filaments. Some of these drugs have multiple effects on the cytoskeleton, for example Latrunculin both prevents actin polymerization as well as enhancing its rate of depolymerization. Typically the microtubule targeting drugs {{can be found in the}} clinic where they are used therapeutically in the treatment of some forms of cancer. As a result of the lack of specificity for specific type of actin (i.e. cannot distinguish between cardiac, smooth muscle, muscle and cytoskeletal forms of actin) the use of these drugs in animals results in unacceptable off target effects. Despite this the actin targeting compounds are still useful tools that can be used on a cellular level to help further our understanding of how this complex part of the cells internal machinery operates. For example, Phalloidin which has been conjugated with a fluorescent probe can be used for visualizing the filamentous actin in fixed samples.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the possible effect of <b>demecolcine,</b> a microtubule-disrupting reagent, on induced enucleation (IE) of sheep meiotically maturing oocytes. Immunofluorescent staining with anti-tubulin antibodies was used to examine the spindle status of the oocytes. When the oocytes with intact germinal vesicles (GV) were cultured in the medium containing various concentrations of <b>demecolcine</b> (0. 01 to 0. 4 µg*mL- 1) for 20 to 22 h, the spindle microtubule organization and first polar body (PB 1) extrusion were inhibited by <b>demecolcine</b> in a dose-dependent manner. The highest IE rate (58. 1 %) was from the treatment with 0. 04 µg*mL- 1 <b>demecolcine.</b> <b>Demecolcine</b> treatment applied after germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) or at metaphase (M) yielded a PB 1 extrusion rate and IE efficiency similar to the treatment applied at the onset of maturation. Analysis by immunofluorescence showed that both nonspindle microtubules and spindle microtubules were significantly disorganized by <b>demecolcine.</b> Combination treatment with <b>demecolcine</b> and cycloheximide (CHX) or 6 -dimethylaminopurine (6 -DMAP) led to single pronuclear formation rather than PB 1 extrusion. When demecolcine-treated oocytes were transferred into demecolcine-free medium, the ability to extrude PB 1 was quickly restored and a 72. 1 % IE rate was obtained following such treatment. These results demonstrate that <b>demecolcine</b> can be used as a potential reagent for induced enucleation of sheep meiotically maturing oocytes and may greatly facilitate research in nuclear transfer...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Our study aims {{to clarify}} the effects of <b>demecolcine,</b> alone or in {{combination}} with sucrose on bovine oocyte protrusion rate, MAPK 1 protein level and c-mos gene expression level. Methods: The effects of the <b>demecolcine</b> concentration, treatment duration, and synergistic effects with sucrose solution on the rate of membrane protrusions of bovine oocytes were investigated. Using real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR, western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence assays, {{the expression of the}} maternal c-mos gene, the protein level of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK 1), and the change in the localization of spindles and nuclei during the <b>demecolcine</b> treatment were analyzed in bovine oocytes. Results: Treatment of bovine oocytes with both <b>demecolcine</b> (0. 6 μg/mL) and sucrose (0. 05 M) for 1 h led to the highest rate of membrane protrusions, and synergistic effects were also observed. Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR analysis revealed that the <b>demecolcine</b> treatment up-regulated the expression of the maternal c-mos gene. Western blot analysis indicated that the <b>demecolcine</b> treatment enhanced the protein level of MAPK 1 in bovine oocytes. Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that the spindles and nuclei were localized at the place of the membrane protrusions. Conclusions: The present results suggest that <b>demecolcine</b> might contribute to the activation of the Mos/MAPK pathway and affect spindle structure.

40|$|Although {{fusion of}} nucleoli was {{observed}} during pronuclear development of zygotes {{and the behavior}} of nucleoli in pronuclei has been suggested {{as an indicator of}} embryonic developmental potential, the mechanism for nucleolar fusion is unclear. Although both cytoskeleton and the nucleolus are important cellular entities, there are no special reports on the relationship between the two. Role of cytoskeleton in regulating fusion of nucleoli was studied using the activated mouse oocyte model. Mouse oocytes were cultured for 6 h in activating medium (Ca 2 +-free CZB medium containing 10 mM SrCl 2 supplemented with or without inhibitors for cytoskeleton or protein synthesis before pronuclear formation, nucleolar fusion, and the activity of maturation-promoting factor (MPF) were examined. Whereas treatment with microfilament inhibitor cytochalasin D or B or intermediate filament inhibitor acrylam-ide suppressed nucleolar fusion efficiently, treatment with microtubule inhibitor <b>demecolcine</b> or nocodazole or protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide had no effect. The cytochala-sin D- or acrylamide-sensitive temporal window coincided well with the reported temporal window for nucleolar fusion in activated oocytes. Whereas a continuous incubation with <b>demecolcine</b> prevented pronuclear formation, pronuclei formed normally when <b>demecolcine</b> was excluded during the first hour of activation treatment when the MPF activity dropped dramatically. The results suggest that 1) microfilaments and intermediate filaments but not microtubules support nucleolar fusion, 2) proteins required for nucleolar fusion including microfilaments and intermediate filaments are not de novo synthesized, and 3) microtubule disruption prevents pronuclear formation by activating MPF. cytoskeleton, nucleoli, oocytes, pronucle...|$|E

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to induce enucleation (IE) of activated mouse oocytes to yield cytoplasts capable of supporting development following nuclear transfer. Fluorescence microscopy for microtubules, microfilaments, and DNA {{was used to evaluate}} meiotic resumption after ethanol activation and the effect of subsequent transient treatments with 0. 4 mug/ml of <b>demecolcine.</b> Using oocytes from B 6 D 2 F 1 (C 57 BL/ 6 x DBA/ 2) donors, the success of IE of chromatin into polar bodies (PBs) was dependent on the duration of <b>demecolcine</b> treatment and the time that such treatment was initiated after activation. Similarly, variations in <b>demecolcine</b> treatment altered the proportions of oocytes exhibiting a reversible compartmentalization of chromatin into PBs. Treatment for 15 min begun immediately after activation yielded an optimized IE rate of 21 % (n = 80) when oocytes were evaluated after overnight recovery in culture. With this protocol, 30 - 50 % of oocytes were routinely scored as compartmentalized when assessed 90 min postactivation. No oocytes could be scored as such following overnight recovery, with 66 % of treated oocytes cleaving to the 2 -cell stage (n = 80). Activated cytoplasts were prepared by mechanical removal of PBs from oocytes whose chromatin had undergone IE or compartmentalization. These cytoplasts were compared with mechanically enucleated, metaphase (M) 11 cytoplasts whose activation was delayed in nuclear transfer experiments using HM- 1 embryonic stem cells. Using oocytes from either B 6 D 2 F 1 or B 6 CBAF 1 (C 57 BL/ 6 x CRA) donors, the in vitro development of cloned embryos using activated cytoplasts was consistently inferior to that observed using MII cytoplasts.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{pharmaceutical}} agents {{has been proposed}} for use in periodontal therapy to inhibit loss of alveolar bone and to promote regeneration of tissues lost to disease. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effects of such agents on periodontal cell-mediated gel contraction, an in vitro process considered representative of wound contraction and remodeling in vivo. Human gingival fibroblasts were cultured in a type I collagen lattice, and contraction was quantified by means of a computer-assisted video imaging system. Cell-gel combinations were prepared with cells both pre-exposed and non-exposed to agents; non-anchored cell-gels were then incubated with agents for various time periods. Agents tested included <b>Demecolcine</b> (an inhibitor of cytoskeletal contraction), growth factors (i. e., TGF-β 1, PDGF, and IGF- 1), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (indomethacin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and flurbiprofen). While <b>Demecolcine</b> inhibited gel contraction, TGF-β 1 (1 - 20 ng/mL), PDGF (100 ng/mL), IGF- 1 (1000 ng/mL), and [PDGF + IGF], all of which have been reported to enhance wound healing in vivo, promoted lattice contraction in this system. In contrast, NSAIDs inhibited cell-gel contraction. Ethanol, used to solubilize two specific NSAIDs, also inhibited cell proliferation and gel contractile ability, even at very low concentrations. These findings indicate that periodontal cells respond differently to various agents in vitro and may be adversely affected by alcohol. Furthermore, the results of this study suggest that the cell-lattice contraction system holds potential as a method for screening agents for positive or negative effects on cell activity...|$|E

This Study was designed to further explore the pharmacological role of <b>Demecolcine</b> (DM) on assisting enucleation in animal somatic cell nuclear transfer. The in vitro matured bovine oocytes were incubated with DM at different concentration, or at a fixed DM con-centration for additional different hours, then the oocytes extrusion cones rate (ECR) were determined in the inverted microscope. The highest ECR (61. 90 %) was measured from the treatment with 0. 5 µg/mL <b>demecolcine.</b> The time-dependent manner {{of the development of}} the extrusion cones, in 2 hr groups were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than in 0 hr, 0. 5 hr, 1 hr and 2. 5 hr groups. The highest ECR were found in vitro matured 18 hr groups (73. 86 %), which was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than that observed in 14 hr, 16 hr groups, and 20 hr groups.

We verified that colchicine and nocodazole, at the doses used in this study, induced microtubule disassembly in the absence {{as well as in the}} presence of cAMP-elevating agents as judged by measurement of [3 H]colchicine binding of total and pelletable tubulin. The involvement of cAMP was revealed by increasing its endogenous production by cholera toxin or by treatment with 8 BrcAMP. The enhancing effects of antimicrotubule drugs and cAMP-elevating agents could be demonstrated by incorporation of [3 H]thymidine into acid-insoluble material, autoradiography of labeled nuclei, or flow cytofluorometri...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} w/w(+) eye assay in Drosophila {{has been}} used for the last 10 years for genotoxic evaluation of a broad number of chemicals with different mechanisms of action. Although chemicals that induce genotoxic effects by mechanisms other than covalent binding to DNA are difficult to detect. The aim of this study was the parallel detection of both mitotic recombination and X chromosome loss induced by five chemical compounds used worldwide as antineoplastic drugs using the w/w(+) somatic assay in Drosophila melanogaster. The compounds tested were the intercalating agent adriamycin (AD), the alkylating compound chlorambucil (CAB) and the spindle poisons <b>demecolcine</b> (DEM), paclitaxel (taxol, TX) and vinblastine (VBL). We used a cross between heterozygous females with a rod-X and a ring-X chromosome mated with ywf males. All four genotypes in the next generation are heterozygous or hemizygous for the w(+) reporter gene and were inspected for the occurrence of white clones in their compound eyes. We found differences in the induction of mitotic recombination when compared with chromosome loss. Genotoxic profiles obtained for the antineoplastic drugs studied indicate direct and indirect effects. While AD seems to be clastogenic due to its induction of X chromosome loss in XrX female...|$|E
40|$|Two-dimensional gel {{electrophoresis}} of intermediate-sized filament-enriched cytoskeletons of epithelial monkey kidney TC 7 cells {{has shown that}} they are composed {{of at least two}} keratins (isoelectric focusing 36, Mr = 48, 500; IEF 46, Mr = 43, 500; HeLa protein catalogue number) and vimentin. Indirect immunofluorescence as well as immunoelectron microscopy using antibodies directed against specific polypeptides sometimes revealed a discontinuous staining of keratin-containing filaments. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of cells stained with keratin or vimentin antibodies also revealed a bright perinuclear staining in 58 % of the cells in interphase. Of particular interest were focal centers from which filaments radiated. Double-label immunofluorescence using tubulin and keratin antibodies showed that these centers codistributed with focal arrays of microtubules (most likely centrosomes) in interphase cells but were not colocalized with centrioles in mitosis or, in many cases, with the microtubule organizing centers seen after release from nocodazole treatment. Treatment of TC 7 cells with <b>demecolcine</b> (10 micrograms/ml, 20 hr) resulted in a drastic rearrangement of the keratin and vimentin filaments. Likewise, treatment with cytochalasin B (10 micrograms/ml, 1 hr) produced a star-like arrangement of the keratin and vimentin filaments and, in most cases, these codistributed with patches of actin. The results provide evidence for the interaction of intermediate filaments (keratins and vimentin) with both microtubules and microfilaments...|$|E
40|$|P-glycoprotein (P-gp; ABCB 1) {{actively}} transports a {{broad range}} of structurally unrelated compounds out of the cell. An important step in the transport cycle is coupling of drug binding with ATP hydrolysis. Drug substrates such as verapamil bind in a common drug-binding pocket at the interface between the TM (transmembrane) domains of P-gp and stimulate ATPase activity. In the present study, we used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and reaction with an MTS (methanethiosulphonate) thiol-reactive analogue of verapamil (MTS-verapamil) to test whether the first TM segment [TM 1 (TM segment 1) ] forms part of the drug-binding pocket. One mutant, L 65 C, showed elevated ATPase activity (10. 7 -fold higher than an untreated control) after removal of unchanged MTS-verapamil. The elevated ATPase activity was due to covalent attachment of MTS-verapamil to Cys 65 because treatment with dithiothreitol returned the ATPase activity to basal levels. Verapamil covalently attached to Cys 65 appears to occupy the drug-binding pocket because verapamil protected mutant L 65 C from modification by MTS-verapamil. The ATPase activity of the MTS-verapamil-modified mutant L 65 C could not be further stimulated with verapamil, calcein acetoxymethyl ester or <b>demecolcine.</b> The ATPase activity could be inhibited by cyclosporin A but not by trans-(E) -flupentixol. These results suggest that TM 1 contributes to the drug-binding pocket...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProtein {{translocation}} {{between different}} subcellular compartments might {{play a significant}} role in various signal transduction pathways. The S 100 family is comprised of the multifunctional, small, acidic proteins, some of which translocate in the form of vesicle-like structures upon increase in intracellular Ca 2 + levels. Previously, cells were fixed before and after calcium activation in order to examine the possible relocation of S 100 proteins. In this study, we were able to track the real-time translocation. We compared the localization of endogenous S 100 A 11 to that of the S 100 A 11 -green fluorescent protein. The application of thapsigargin, an agent increasing intracellular Ca 2 + levels, resulted in the relocation of the S 100 A 11. In contrast, addition of EGTA, which specifically binds Ca 2 +, either inhibited the ongoing process of translocation or prevented its induction. Since translocation was not affected by treatment with brefeldin A, it appears that S 100 A 11 relocates in an endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi-independent pathway. Furthermore, the depolymerization of actin filaments by amlexanox did not affect the capacity of S 100 A 11 to translocate. However, the time course treatment with <b>demecolcine,</b> which depolymerizes tubulin filaments, resulted in cease of translocation, suggesting that the tubulin network is required for this process...|$|E
