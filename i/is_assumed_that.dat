5|$|Bulk {{francium}} {{has never}} been viewed. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, it <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> francium would appear as a highly reactive metal, if enough could be collected together {{to be viewed as}} a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable, since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.|$|E

5|$|Kelly is {{generally}} considered to be the Ripper's final victim, and it <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the crimes ended because of the culprit's death, imprisonment, institutionalisation, or emigration. The Whitechapel murders file details another four murders that happened after the canonical five: those of Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, the Pinchin Street torso, and Frances Coles.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Æthelhard's family {{background}} or early life, however it <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> he {{was a native of}} Mercia. He first appears in the historical record as abbot of a monastery at Louth, Lincolnshire before being named to the diocese of Winchester. He was consecrated Bishop of Winchester sometime after 759 and before 778.|$|E

5|$|Polish {{historian}} Rafał Jaworski {{states that}} the estimates {{of the size of}} Bolesław's army range between 2,000–5,000 Polish warriors, in addition to Thietmar's reported 1,000Pechenegs, 300German knights, and 500Hungarian mercenaries. Less is known about Yaroslav's army, but it <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> he managed to collect a force of similar size. It is also believed that he was aware of Bolesław's intentions and had time to make defensive preparations.|$|E
5|$|Scientists do not {{yet know}} what these dinosaurs ate. Having very small, ridged teeth they could not have chewed tough, fibrous plants as {{effectively}} as other dinosaurs of the same period. It <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> pachycephalosaurs lived on a mixed diet of leaves, seeds, and fruits. The sharp, serrated teeth would have been very effective for shredding plants.|$|E
5|$|The Do 17P-2 was {{identical}} to the P-1, with the additional installation of an ETC 500 bomb rack under the fuselage. These aircraft were designed for night reconnaissance.

5|$|The {{chronological order}} of the kings from the second kingdom era is highly uncertain; nevertheless, it <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the letter of Enna-Dagan lists them in a chronological order.

5|$|Two of Vermigli's {{former colleagues}} in Lucca—Lacizi and Tremellius—would {{join him in}} Strasbourg. In 1544 he was elected canon of St. Thomas Church, Strasbourg. In 1545 Vermigli married his first wife, Catherine Dammartin, a former nun from Metz. Catherine knew no Italian, and Peter very little German, so it <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> they conversed in Latin.|$|E
5|$|While large {{portions}} of the Old Testament are missing, it <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the codex originally contained the whole of both Testaments. About half of the Greek Old Testament (or Septuagint) survived, along with a complete New Testament, the entire Deuterocanonical books, the Epistle of Barnabas and portions of The Shepherd of Hermas.|$|E

5|$|Another {{approach}} is possible, originally developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov, for a continuous-time stochastic process with any metric space as its state space. For {{the construction of}} such a stochastic process, it <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the sample functions of the stochastic process belong to some suitable function space, which is usually the Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. This {{approach is}} now more used than the separability assumption, but such a stochastic process based on this approach will be automatically separable.|$|E
5|$|Based on its composition, it <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the magma at Licancabur {{formed from}} the partial melting of the oceanic crust subducted at the Peru-Chile Trench after metamorphosis. This magma melted {{part of the}} mantle wedge above the subducting plate, mixing with the melt products. Further {{contamination}} by crustal Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite-like rocks from the Archean, crystal fractionation and magma mixing further up in the crust then yielded the Licancabur magmas. The younger lavas may have formed from the mixing of dacite with the magmas forming the older lavas. Some inclusions in Licancabur rocks seem to be from wall rocks of the magma chamber.|$|E
5|$|Cantor avoided paradoxes by {{recognizing}} {{that there are}} two types of multiplicities. In his set theory, when it <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the ordinals form a set, the resulting contradiction only implies that the ordinals form an inconsistent multiplicity. On the other hand, Bertrand Russell treated all collections as sets, which leads to paradoxes. In Russell's set theory, the ordinals form a set, so the resulting contradiction implies that the theory is inconsistent. From 1901 to 1903, Russell discovered three paradoxes implying that his set theory is inconsistent: the Burali-Forti paradox (which was just mentioned), Cantor's paradox, and Russell's paradox. Russell named paradoxes after Cesare Burali-Forti and Cantor even though neither of them believed that they had found paradoxes.|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> the victors were Captain Don Gentile and Captain John Trevor Godfrey of the 4th Fighter Group. By this date, Wilcke had claimed 162 enemy {{aircraft}} in 732 combat missions. His death was announced in the Wehrmachtbericht, an information bulletin issued by {{the headquarters of the}} Wehrmacht, on 30 March.|$|E
5|$|Further {{observational}} improvements led to {{the realization}} that our Solar System is located in the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies in the Universe. It <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that it is expanding at an increasing rate. The majority of mass in the Universe appears to exist in an unknown form called dark matter.|$|E

During the going-away party held for Bette and Tina, who are planning on moving to New York, they watch the film and Jenny is found dead in the swimming pool in the back yard. It <b>is</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>that</b> she either fell or was pushed from the landing above the back steps, which is unfinished and lacks a proper railing. Because {{so many people have}} been offended, betrayed and hurt by Jenny, there are many suspects and they are interrogated.|$|E
