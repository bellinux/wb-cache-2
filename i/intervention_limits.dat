40|$|Does {{military}} intervention affect civilian death tolls? Existing {{research has focused}} on international actors ’ ability to limit ongoing slaughter but has not examined their ability to prevent the emergence or escalation of such killing. I develop a theory of government killing that accounts not only for the government’s decision to kill civilians but also for the transference of the killing order from leader to perpetrator, and for the perpetrator’s implementation of that order. Focusing on the principal– agent relationship produces new expectations about the effects of military inter-vention on government killing. I find that international actors are well equipped to limit civilian slaughter: intervention supporting the government decreases the like-lihood that a government orders civilians killed. Intervention against the government leads to a decrease in death tolls when killing occurs. Ultimately, supportive inter-vention is a useful means of preventing government killing, while oppositional <b>intervention</b> <b>limits</b> its escalation once it begins...|$|E

Recent research har argued that the model may not perform empirically as bad as previous investigation have suggested. In order to investigate this point, we first estimate the model by a nonparametric density matching procedure, and extract the implied drift and diffusion function for the exchange rate process. This allows us to view the target zone model essentially as a time series model, with a clearly defined diffusion process governing target zone exchange rates. We then compare the implied drift and diffusion function with their nonparametric estimates. We conclude that exchange rates under consideration are actually more mean reverting than the target zone model predicts. When very close to the <b>intervention</b> <b>limits,</b> the data are far from the target zone model's implications.

Most of the relevant information relates to radiocaesium, but the applicability for some other radionuclides has also been evaluated. Improved live-monitoring techniques for radiocaesium, developed since the Chernobyl accident, allow the identification of animals whose contamination levels exceed the <b>intervention</b> <b>limits,</b> so that countermeasures can be effectively chosen and targeted. Generally the most effective approach for domesticated and semi-domesticated animals is either to remove contaminated animals from the affected area or to provide uncontaminated feed.

The introduction of other effective changes in management practices, such as changing hunting seasons for game, or slaughtering {{at a time of}} year when the animals have been grazing on less contaminated herbage, depends on a good understanding of the behaviour of radionuclides in these ecosystems.

In recent years, there are three major trends of the remote sensing field: increase of the amount of available information, the growth of the number of the proposed methods and applications, and improvement of computing and networking environments. However, current practice analysis requires manual intervention by remote sensing experts. For example, technical knowledge and experiences are required in the selection of data and processes, parameter tuning, and acquisition of training data. Such manual <b>intervention</b> <b>limits</b> the use of satellite data and the scale of satellite data analysis. From the trends and the limitations mentioned above, there is a great demand for an automatic satellite data interpretation system. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a framework of automatic satellite data interpretation system that can implement query-driven interpretation of optical satellite data using various data and processes. The proposed framework aims to implement the series of analysis workflow from the selection of data and processes to the execution of higher-order analysis. This leads to the expansion of the use of satellite data by users who do not have a technical knowledge and experience in remote sensing, and contributes to the rapid provision of the results of urgent analysis, such as disaster damage detection. 衛星リモートセンシングによる観測は広域同時性，定期反復性，多波長性という特徴を持ち，その特性を活かして幅広い分野に応用されてきた．衛星リモートセンシングにおける近年の主要な動向には，取得情報量の増大，新たな解析手法・アプリケーションの増加，そして計算機・ネットワーク性能の向上が挙げられる．しかし衛星データの解析時には解析の目的や解析対象地域，解析日時を踏まえた衛星データの選定，補正処理，解析処理の選定，パラメータチューニングや教師データの取得などリモートセンシングの専門家による知識経験を活かした作業が不可欠となっており，前述の技術革新の恩恵が限定的となっているほか，衛星データの活用場面や解析規模を制限している．衛星データや解析手法等を効率的に管理・運用可能な自動判読システムへの期待はますます高まるものと予想される．本論文ではこうした課題に資する提案として，光学衛星データ解析を対象とし，判読に用いられるデータやプロセスの蓄積共有，及びそれらを用いたクエリ駆動型の高精度自動判読システムの枠組みを構築し，将来の実利用への適用可能性を検討することを目的とする．提案する自動判読の枠組みはデータの選択から高次解析までの一連の解析ワークフローの自動化を目指すものであり，そのような研究はこれまでに無く，高い新規性を持つ．簡易な判読クエリの入力から解析の自動実行ができるようになることで，リモートセンシング技術に関する高度な知識経験を持っていない一般利用者が衛星データ解析を手軽に実行できるようになりデータ利用の拡大に繋がる事が期待されるほか，災害時被害状況把握における時間的ロスを削減でき，解析結果の迅速な提供にも寄与すると考えられる...|$|E

The potential of spontaneous vegetation for phytoremediation and/or phytostabilization was evaluated. The pH of the soils ranges from neutral to basic, with very low organic matter and nitrogen contents. There are imbalances between exchangeable cations like potassium (K) and calcium (Ca), mainly due to high magnesium (Mg) content that can strongly limit plant production. Moreover, in all of the studied soils there are high levels of cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) (> 70, > 1300 and > 1300 mg kg − 1, respectively).

40|$|Objective: This {{prospective}} multicenter {{investigation was}} conducted to define the repeatability of duplex-based identification of venous reflux and the relative effect of key parameters on the reproducibility of the test. Methods: Repeatability was studied by having the same technologist perform duplicate tests, {{at the same time}} of the day, using the same reflux-provoking maneuver and with the patient in the same position. Reproducibility was examined by having two different technologists perform the test at the same time of the day, using the same reflux-provoking maneuver and with the patient in the same position. Facilitated reproducibility was studied by having two different technologists examine the same patients immediately after an educational <b>intervention.</b> <b>Limits</b> of agreement between two duplex scans were studied by changing three elements of the test: time of the day (morning vs afternoon), patient's position (standing vs supine), and reflux initiation (manual vs automatic compression decompression). Results: The study enrolled 17 healthy volunteers and 57 patients with primary chronic venous disease. Repeatability of reflux time measurements in deep veins did not significantly differ with the time of day, the patient's position, or the reflux-provoking maneuver. Reflux measurements in the superficial veins were more repeatable (P <. 05) when performed in the morning with the patient standing. The agreement between the clinical interpretations significantly depended on a selected cut point (Spearman's rho, - 0. 4; P <. 01). Interpretations agreed in 93. 4 % of the replicated measurements when a 0. 5 -second cut point was selected. The training intervention improved the frequency of agreement to 94. 4 % (kappa = 0. 9). Alternations of the time of the duplex scan, the patient's position, and the reflux-provoking maneuver significantly decreased reliability. Conclusions: This study provides evidence to develop a new standard for duplex ultrasound detection of venous reflux. Reports should include information on the time of the test, the patient's position, and the provoking maneuver used. Adopting a uniform cut point of 0. 5 second for pathologic reflux can significantly improve the reliability of reflux detection.

40|$|Sandy soils in {{the border}} area of Belgium and the Netherlands (the Kempen region), are heavily {{contaminated}} with cadmium and zinc by atmospheric deposition from nearby smelters. Leaching of heavy metals from the topsoil is a major risk for groundwater contamination. The sandy soils in the Kempen area are vulnerable for leaching due to the acidifying conditions in these soils. Regional modeling of groundwater contamination by leaching of cadmium from soils in a diffusely polluted area {{is the subject of}} this study. An attempt has been made to model the present and predict the future concentrations of cadmium in shallow groundwater and the metal binding processes in the unsaturated zone in the total Kempen area. Leaching of cadmium is spatially highly variable. It depends on the soil type, the groundwater depth and cadmium input concentrations. In the Kempen area, the heavy metal load to the soil is controlled mostly by atmospheric deposition and the net rainwater infiltration. The atmospheric deposition of cadmium decreases strongly with the distance from the zinc smelters. In the mid-seventies, a change in production processes caused a sharp decline of cadmium emission. There is no temporal or spatial data available about the (historic) atmospheric deposition of cadmium covering the total Kempen region. Therefore, the atmospheric deposition of cadmium was reconstructed from the analyzed cadmium content in forest soil samples. Forest soil samples were chosen because the cadmium contents in these soils are not influenced by the use of manure, (lime) fertilizers and sewage sludge. For 13 locations with varying distances from the smelters the historic atmospheric deposition of cadmium was calculated by iteration with the analyzed cadmium content in the soil. Cadmium adsorption coefficients (K_F) for the individual locations, which are needed for these calculations, were derived with existing meta-models as a function of soil properties like pH, organic matter and clay content. In this reconstruction, the historic changes in deposition rates of cadmium were linearly related to the zinc production of the smelters. The calculated depositions at the 13 locations were spatially interpolated to an area-covering map of atmospheric deposition rates with the distance from the smelters and the predominant wind direction as input variables. Leaching of cadmium from topsoil to groundwater is a function of soil type. Acid sandy soils of relatively low organic matter content demonstrate a low retardation capacity. The pH, organic matter, and clay content taken from the chemical characterization of soil types from the Dutch soil map were used to calculate Freundlich adsorption isotherms (K_F) for cadmium by using existing multiple linear regression models. Together with the groundwater level, this determines the breakthrough time of cadmium to the groundwater. Groundwater levels were derived from a regional groundwater model. The unsaturated zone model HYDRUS was used to model the breakthrough of cadmium for all unique combinations of soil type, groundwater level and cadmium input load. The individual maps were classified to get a unique combination of input parameters. The Van Genuchten parameters for modelling the unsaturated water flow were calculted with pedo-transfer functions soil parameters like texture, bulk-density and organic matter content.

40|$|Malnutrition {{is present}} in up to 48 % of chronic kidney disease {{patients}} on the initiation of renal replacement therapy (dialysis) 1. At this time, malnutrition is an independent and significant predictor {{of morbidity and mortality}} 2. As a consequence of progressive deterioration in kidney function, symptoms of decreased appetite and reduced intake are common factors leading to the decline in nutritional status 3. However, at present there is little evidence to inform nutrition assessment and intervention for pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD). The {{purpose of this study was}} to provide evidence for the nutritional management of CKD patients prior to dialysis with an aim to optimise nutritional status. To address this, an investigation comprising of two phases examining nutrition assessment and intervention in a sample of pre-dialysis Stage IV and V CKD patients was undertaken. Both phases of the study were conducted through Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital (RBWH) Department of Renal Medicine pre-dialysis clinic. Participants met the following criteria: adult (> 18 years) Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) < 30 ml/min CKD, not previously seen by a dietitian for Stage IV CKD, absence of communication or intellectual impairment inhibiting their ability to undertake the intervention and an absence of malnutrition from a cause other than CKD. Phase I was a cross-sectional investigation into the performance of a range of tools assessing nutrition status, conducted at baseline of Phase II. Phase II was a randomisedcontrolled trial designed to determine if providing individual nutrition counselling with regular telephone follow-up resulted in improved body composition, nutritional status, dietary intake and quality of life, compared with standard care. A range of intermediate, clinical and patient-centred outcome measures were collected at baseline and twelve weeks. Body composition was measured by total body potassium counting (TBK), considered a gold-standard measure of body cell mass (BCM, the body’s functional metabolising tissue). Nutritional status was measured using Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) and a number of modified versions of SGA, 7 -point SGA, Malnutrition Inflammation Score (MIS) and the scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). Dietary intake was measured using 3 -day food records. Quality of life was measured by Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form version 1. 3 (KDQOL-SFTM v 1. 3 © RAND University), combining the Short Form- 36 (SF- 36), with a kidney disease-specific module 4. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS Version 13 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Phase I analysis was based on descriptive and bi-variate statistics, including chi-square, t-test and ANOVA. For phase II, change variables (Week 12 – Week 0) were created for the outcome measures (BCM, SGA tools, dietary intake (energy and protein) and the 18 KDQOL-SFTM subscales). The assessment of change in outcome measures by treatment group was undertaken by ANCOVA, adjusting for baseline values. Further multivariate analysis (ANCOVA and MANCOVA models) were created for outcome variables when confounding variables were identified and adjusted for. In Phase I, 56 patients (Male n= 34; age mean (±SD) 70. 7 (± 14. 0); GFRMDRD 22. 4 (± 6. 5) mL/min) underwent baseline assessment. In this population the prevalence of malnutrition was 19. 6 % (n= 11, SGA B; no C ratings). Malnutrition was associated with lower body cell mass (mean BCM, 26. 3 vs. 33. 4 kg p= 0. 007), body weight (64. 8 vs. 76. 1 kg p= 0. 042), BMI (23. 7 vs. 27. 6 kg/m 2 p= 0. 015) and greater weight loss over previous 6 months (- 6. 2 vs. - 0. 1 kg p= 0. 004). Body cell mass indexed for height (BCM-I kg/m 3. 5) had a relationship with MIS (r=- 0. 27 p= 0. 063) and scored PG-SGA (r=- 0. 27 p= 0. 060), but not with 7 -point SGA (F(4) 2. 24 p= 0. 080). PG-SGA best discriminated malnutrition based on a BCM-I cut-off of < 5. 25 kg/ m 3. 5 of all the modified SGA tools. The scored PG-SGA including the global SGA rating is recommended for use in pre-dialysis CKD. In Phase II, 50 patients, (Male n= 31 (62. 0 %); age 69. 7 (± 12. 0) years; GFRMDRD 22. 1 (± 6. 9) ml/min) completed the 12 week study period (intervention n= 24; standard care n= 26). At 12 weeks, there was a clinically significant improvement in all outcome measures in the intervention group. There was a 3. 9 % (95 % CI, - 1. 0 to 8. 7 %) mean difference in change for Body Cell Mass between the treatment groups, represented by a significant decrease in the standard care group and maintenance in the intervention group. Nutritional status measured by SGA improved or was maintained (24 / 24) in the intervention group, however, decreased in 14 % (4 / 26) of the standard care group. Energy intake significantly improved in the intervention group resulting in a mean difference in change of 17. 7 kJ/kg (8. 2 to 27. 2 kJ/kg). Quality of life improved significantly in 10 of the 18 sub-scales in the intervention group. Significant effect modification for gender was apparent for many of the outcome variables, with females responding most significantly to the intervention treatment. This study concluded that, overall, structured nutrition <b>intervention</b> <b>limits</b> the deterioration in nutritional status, improves dietary intake and quality of life in patients with CKD prior to the onset of renal replacement therapy. This thesis makes a significant contribution to the evidence base for nutritional management of pre-dialysis Stage IV CKD. The use of SGA for nutrition assessment and including PG-SGA to measure change is recommended for routine nutrition assessment of pre-dialysis CKD. The provision of individual nutrition counselling with regular follow-up, with a focus on promoting intake provides beneficial patient outcomes supporting optimal nutritional status in pre-dialysis CKD patients...|$|E

40|$|The {{relatively}} {{high cost of}} delivering many public health <b>interventions</b> <b>limits</b> their potential for broad public impact by reducing their likelihood of adoption and maintenance over time. Practitioners identify cost as the primary factor for which interventions they select to implement, but researchers rarely disseminate cost information or consider its importance when developing new interventions. A new approach is proposed whereby intervention developers assess what individuals and agencies adopting their interventions {{are willing to pay}} and then design interventions that are responsive to this price range. The ultimate goal is to develop effective and affordable interventions, called lean interventions, which are widely adopted and have greater public health impact.

Most studies, however, focus on the static efficiency of the corresponding contract structures. For more realistic results, we consider transportation capacity as a durable good and analyze the dynamic efficiency of structures such as leasing and the selling of tradable rights with or without secondary markets and futures markets. Compared to a lease contract structure where the pipeline owner controls the transportation capacity at all periods the selling of tradable rights with a competitive secondary market dissipates the monopolist's market power and leads to higher social welfare. However, the monopolist's articipation in the futures market can reduce welfare by providing him with a credible way to restrain production in future periods, thus restoring the market power he enjoyed in a lease situation. ...|$|R
