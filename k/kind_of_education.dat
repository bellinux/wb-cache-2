25|$|Some {{organizations}} or individuals within certain movements also propose introducing {{a more inclusive}} language policy either via official multilingualism, or an official unilingual language policy in an auxiliary language so as to intrude minimally into the first-language choice of residents. Such ideas are sometimes inspired by Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights relating to {{discrimination on the basis}} of language, and Article 26(3) of the same Declaration so as to give parents the freedom “to choose the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> that shall be given to their children.” Others can be inspired by religious or other beliefs.|$|E
25|$|The need {{to create}} a working-class culture and a counter-hegemony relates to Gramsci's call for a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> that could develop working-class intellectuals, whose task was not to {{introduce}} Marxist ideology into the consciousness of the proletariat as a set of foreign notions, but to renovate the existing intellectual activity of the masses and make it natively critical of the status quo. His ideas about an education system for this purpose correspond with the notion of critical pedagogy and popular education as theorized and practised in later decades by Paulo Freire in Brazil, and have much in common with the thought of Frantz Fanon. For this reason, partisans of adult and popular education consider Gramsci an important voice to this day.|$|E

25|$|Basic Education {{is defined}} as the levels from {{preschool}} to middle school and includes other types of education such as special education, indigenous schools, bilingual school and adult remedial education. The state contains nearly 2,000 schools at this level including 1,225 preschools, 1,392 primary schools and 364 middle schools. Education Media Superior includes high schools, vocational schools and technical schools for those who graduate middle school. There are 115 campuses of this type located in all the municipalities of the state, but it covers less than 80% of the demand for this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>education.</b> The average number of years of schooling in the state is 7.5 years, meaning the completion of primary school and {{a little over a year}} in middle school. Levels of schooling increase with younger generations, with nearly all under 5 attending preschool before primary school. Nearly all children of age attend and finish primary school, and nearly all of these begin middle school. However, 8.8% of the population fifteen and older have not enrolled in school at all. 19% have completed primary, 27.2% have completed at least middle school/technical school, 17.9% have completed high school and 14.5 have gone onto higher education.|$|E

Wollstonecraft argues that women should {{have all of the}} intellectual and moral training given to men, though she does not provide women with a place to use these new skills beyond the home.|$|E
500|$|Progressive education, a {{pedagogy}} promoting {{learning through}} real-life experiences, {{was at its}} zenith in the United States in the 1920s and 30s, and the Avery Coonley School was a widely known model of these theories in action. Avery Coonley was featured regularly in Progressive Education and other professional journals, and in 1938, the editor of Progressive Education, Gertrude Hartman, published {{a profile of the}} Avery Coonley School in her book Finding Wisdom: Chronicles of a School of Today. She noted, [...] "isitors {{from all parts of the}} United States and from foreign countries [...] to see the school—sometimes as many as thirty in a day." [...] Hartman described in great detail the curriculum and daily life of the school, which had by then added a seventh and eighth grade, commenting that the most noticeable thing about it is the spirit of earnestness and joy which pervades it... There is a fundamental philosophy of life and education underlying the work of the school, which gives clear direction to all its activities. Broad areas are planned, which form the framework of the curriculum. These however are flexible and subject to modification depending upon conditions. The book described the progress of the students from their first year of kindergarten through their ten years of study, capturing in photos, stories, and examples of students' work their encounters with nature, history, art and other subjects through creative play and collaborative projects. She concluded with observations about the importance of the daily life of the school in developing social responsibility: It is the belief of those concerned with the school that out of the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> described here will emerge more socially enlightened members of society than the education of our generation has produced... The method in which those in the school place their faith is the building into the very nature of growing boys and girls, through their growing years, those qualities of mind and spirit from which alone a new attitude towards human relations can evolve. Finding Wisdom became a classic in the education field and solidified the Avery Coonley School's national reputation as a model of progressive education.|$|E

2500|$|Plato {{acknowledged}} that extending {{civil and political}} rights to women would substantively alter the nature of the household and the state. Aristotle, who had been taught by Plato, denied that women were slaves or subject to property, arguing that [...] "nature has distinguished between the female and the slave", but he considered wives to be [...] "bought". He argued that women's main economic activity is that of safeguarding the household property created by men. According to Aristotle the labour of women added no value because [...] "the art of household management is not identical with the art of getting wealth, for the one uses the material which the other provides". Contrary to these views, the Stoic philosophers argued for equality of the sexes, sexual inequality being in their view contrary to the laws of nature. In doing so, they followed the Cynics, who argued that men and women should wear the same clothing and receive the same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>education.</b> They also saw marriage as a moral companionship between equals rather than a biological or social necessity, and practiced these views in their lives as well as their teachings. The Stoics adopted the views of the Cynics and added them to their own theories of human nature, thus putting their sexual egalitarianism on a strong philosophical basis.|$|E
2500|$|Ecopedagogy {{calls for}} the remaking of {{capitalist}} practices and seeks to re-engage democracy to include multispecies interests {{in the face of}} our current global ecological crisis. It does so by using different ideas that challenge the way we see education. [...] In Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy and Planetary Crisis: The Ecopedagogy Movement, Richard Kahn (2010) reformulates Herbert Marcuse’s critical theories of society, and supports the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> that seizes the power of radical environmental activists and supports the earth democracy in which multispecies interests are represented. The destruction of habitats and threats to biodiversity resulting from expansion of human population and consumption is rarely addressed in a way that confronts students with the necessity to consider moral implications of such destruction. Pedagogically, a return to education associated with significant life experiences, such as hiking in wilderness areas as a youth; as well as strategically significant education, action competence, social learning, and variations and combinations of those and many other pedagogical approaches developed in the past 40 years. Some of these pedagogical approaches have been disputed—for example, the belief that experiencing environment first hand is an essential component of engaging people in conservation has been disputed by arguments that these education efforts have been informed by behaviorist socio-psychology models that assumed a linear causality between education experience and pro-environmental behavior. [...] Rather, the critics have argued that people’s environmental behaviors are too complex and contextually dependent to be captured by a simple casual model.
