5|$|<b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>test,</b> {{a number}} of cards are {{presented}} to the participants. The figures on the cards differ with respect to color, quantity, and shape.

5|$|Notable debutants in {{this series}} were Alec Stewart and Nasser Hussain, who both made their debuts in the first Test. Alec Stewart was not England's wicket-keeper <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>Test</b> series, as Jack Russell kept wicket.|$|E
5|$|Schaeffer's {{chemical}} test {{is often used}} to help identify and differentiate Agaricus species. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>test,</b> aniline plus nitric acid are applied {{to the surface of the}} fruit body, and if positive, a red or orange color forms. Agaricus deserticola has a positive Schaeffer's reaction, similar to species in section Arvensis in the genus Agaricus.|$|E

5|$|Another test {{known as}} a phototest is the most useful in {{identifying}} solar urticaria. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>test,</b> one centimeter segments of skin are subject to varying amounts of UVA and UVB radiation {{in order to determine}} the specific dosage of the certain form of radiation that causes the urticaria to form. When testing for its less intense form (fixed solar urticaria), phototesting should be conducted only in the areas where the hives have appeared to avoid the possibility of getting false-negative results.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009, Bianchi {{was linked}} by the BBC {{and various other}} media sources to the second Ferrari Formula One seat {{occupied}} by Luca Badoer during Felipe Massa's absence. Bianchi tested for Ferrari at the young drivers test at Circuito de Jerez {{for two of the}} three days, over 1–2 December 2009. The other drivers tested on 3 December included Daniel Zampieri, Marco Zipoli and Pablo Sánchez López as the top three finishers in the 2009 Italian Formula Three Championship. Bianchi's performance <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>test</b> led to him becoming the first recruit of the Ferrari Driver Academy and signing up to a long-term deal to remain at the team's disposal.|$|E

40|$|<b>This</b> <b>testing</b> was {{designed}} to evaluate various voltage-temperature (V-T) charge curves for use in low-Earth-orbit (LEO) applications of nickel-cadmium battery cells. The trends established relating V-T level to utilizable capacity were unexpected. The trends toward lower capacity at higher V-T levels was predominant <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>testing.</b> <b>This</b> effect was {{a function of the}} V-T level, the temperature, and the cell history. This effect was attributed to changes occurring in the positive plate. The results imply that for some applications, the use of even lower V-T levels may be warranted. The need to limit overcharge, especially in the early phases of missions, is underlined by <b>this</b> <b>test</b> program...|$|R
