The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses {{all but two of}} them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes.

This name for the mountain was adopted on February 7, 1947. The name Itcha Mountain was adopted on March 4, 1954 for the range's second <b>highest</b> <b>peak.</b>|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that Bronze Age people had settled {{in the area around}} 1000 BC, although it is not known whether these settlements were permanent or temporary. The town itself was founded in the 11th century when Benedictine monks established a priory {{at the foot of the}} <b>highest</b> <b>peak</b> of Malvern Hills. During the 19th century Malvern developed rapidly from a village to a sprawling conurbation owing to its popularity as a hydrotherapy spa based on its spring waters. Immediately following the decline of spa tourism towards the end of the 19th century, the town's focus shifted to education with the establishment of several private boarding schools in former hotels and large villas. A further major expansion was the result of the relocation of the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) to Malvern in 1942. QinetiQ, TRE's successor company, remains the town's largest local employer.|$|E

5|$|Gerlachovský štít was {{not always}} {{considered}} the highest mountain in the Tatras. After the first official measurement of peaks in the Tatras {{during the period of}} the Habsburg Monarchy in the 18th century, Kriváň (2,494m) was considered the highest. Other candidate peaks for the status of the highest mountain at that time were Lomnický štít (2,633m) and Ľadový štít (2,627m). The first person to accurately name Gerlachovský štít as the <b>highest</b> <b>peak</b> was the forester Ľudovít (Ludwig) Greiner in 1838. Greiner's measurement was formally confirmed by an Austrian Army survey party in 1868.

5|$|Jamaica–179th Street {{was opened}} on December 11, 1950, {{although}} it had been planned to be built at 178th Street as early as 1928. At the time, the Queens Boulevard Line {{was part of the}} Independent Subway System (IND), but the original IND plans did not provide for constructing the 178th Street station until the line was extended even further to Queens Village. The line opened to 169th Street, the next station south, in 1937. Various changes in plans, as well as material shortages due to the Great Depression and World War II, delayed the project until 1946. Jamaica–179th Street became among Queens' busiest upon its 1950 opening. After a period of deterioration, the station was renovated twice, in the 1980s and the 2000s. As a result of planning for a never-built expansion to Queens Village, the station has 8 storage tracks to its east, giving it the <b>highest</b> <b>peak</b> capacity of any New York City Subway station.|$|E
