40|$|The {{generalized}} entropy theory (GET) {{offers many}} insights into how molecular parameters influence polymer glass-formation. Given {{the fact that}} chain rigidity often plays {{a critical role in}} understanding the glass-formation of polymer materials, the GET was originally developed based on models of semiflexible chains. Consequently, all previous calculations within the GET considered polymers with some degree of chain rigidity. Motivated by unexpected results from computer simulations of <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> polymer melts concerning the dependence of thermodynamic and dynamic properties on the cohesive interaction strength (ϵ), the present paper employs the GET to explore the influence of ϵ on glass-formation in models of polymer melts with a vanishing bending rigidity, i. e., <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> polymer melts. In accord with simulations, the GET for <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> polymer melts predicts that basic dimensionless thermodynamic properties (such as the thermal expansion coefficient and isothermal compressibility) are universal functions of the temperature scaled by ϵ in the regime of low pressures. Similar scaling behavior is also found for the configurational entropy density in the GET for <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> polymer melts. Moreover, we find that the characteristic temperatures of glass-formation increase linearly with ϵ and that the fragility is independent of ϵ in <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> polymer melts, predictions that are again consistent with simulations of glass-forming polymer melts composed of <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> chains. Beyond an explanation of these general trends observed in simulations, the GET for <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> polymer melts predicts the presence of a positive residual configurational entropy at low temperatures, indicating a return to Arrhenius relaxation in the low temperature glassy state.

The more advanced structure is the <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> base; it provides support to the mattress in every pressure point.

40|$|NpT {{ensemble}} Monte Carlo simulations {{were performed}} for <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> Lennard-Jones chains in the solid phase. The bond length between monomers within the chains is fixed to L=σ and the molecule {{is free to}} adopt any configuration. The solid structure of <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> chains is obtained by randomly locating the bonds of the chain within a face centered cubic close packed arrangement of atoms. For <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> chains {{it is believed that}} the stable solid phase is disordered. Such a solid is considered in this work. Computer simulations were performed for chains with m= 3, 4 and 5 monomer units, and results were obtained for the equation of state and internal energy of the chains. An extension of Wertheim's TPT 1 to the solid phase of Lennard-Jones chains (C. Vega, F. J. Blas and A. Galindo, J. Chem. Phys., 116, 7645, 2002) has been proposed recently. The simulation results of this work provide a check on the performance of this theory. It is found that Wertheim's TPT 1 successfully predicts the equation of state and internal energies of <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> LJ chains in the solid phase. Finally, a rigid LJ chain in a linear configuration has been considered. Computer simulations were also performed for the rigid chain in an ordered solid structure. It is found that <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> and linear rigid chains present quite different equations of state and different thermodynamic properties in the solid phase.

40|$|Abstract — Introducing a WDM {{dimension}} {{on the top}} of a TDM PON {{system is}} a natural evolution to increase the capacity of an optical access network, and this can also offer additional flexibility options. Several hybrid WDM/TDM PON architectures can be designed, each with a different degree of flexibility, going from fully static, over partially <b>flexible</b> to <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> architectures. The more flexible architectures, however, are either more expensive, experience a higher power loss or are less secure. A question that arises is if a <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> architecture is really needed, or if a partially flexible architecture already can serve several flexibility advantages, like energy efficiency, network migration and network extensibility. An important assessment parameter is the number of needed wavelengths at a certain network load.

Subtle differences in the mobility of the adsorbate close to the surface result in the free energy of adsorption being overestimated by the rigid model, relative to the <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> case.

Simulations have been performed on chains of variable rigidities going from the <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> to the <b>fully</b> rigid chains. Very interestingly, it is found that there exists a universal relation (a power law) between the zero- density viscosity of the Lennard-Jones chains and their radius of gyration whatever the rigidity of the chain and for all tested temperatures (ranging from 2. 5 to 6 in reduced units). Furthermore, for the studied range of temperature, it is shown that the zero-density viscosity of both <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> chains and <b>fully</b> rigid chains models can be obtained with an accuracy of a few percents know- ing only the dimer viscosity and the length of the chain...|$|R

40|$|While the {{dynamics}} of a <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> polymer ejecting a capsid through a nanopore has been extensively studied, the ejection dynamics of semiflexible polymers has not been properly characterized. Here we report results from simulations of ejection dynamics of semiflexible polymers ejecting from spherical capsids. Ejections start from strongly confined polymer conformations of constant initial monomer density. We find that, unlike for <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> polymers, for semiflexible polymers the force measured at the pore does not show a direct relation to the instantaneous ejection velocity. The cumulative waiting time t(s), that is, the time at which a monomer s exits the capsid the last time, shows a clear change when increasing the polymer rigidity κ. Major part of an ejecting polymer is driven out of the capsid by internal pressure. At the final stage the polymer escapes the capsid by diffusion. For the driven part there is a cross-over from essentially exponential growth of t with s of the <b>fully</b> <b>flexible</b> polymers to a scale-invariant form. In addition, a clear dependence of t on N_ 0 was found. These findings combined give the dependence t(s) ∝ N_ 0 ^ 0. 55 s^ 1. 33 for the strongly rigid polymers. This cross-over in dynamics where κ acts as a control parameter is reminiscent of a phase transition. This analogy is further enhanced by our finding a perfect data collapse of t for polymers of different N_ 0 and any constant κ. Comment: 11 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
