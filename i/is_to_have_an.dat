5|$|If the {{controller}} were to background garbage collect {{all of the}} spare blocks before it was absolutely necessary, new data written from the host could be written without having to move any data in advance, letting the performance operate at its peak speed. The trade-off {{is that some of}} those blocks of data are actually not needed by the host and will eventually be deleted, but the OS did not tell {{the controller}} this information. The result is that the soon-to-be-deleted data is rewritten to another location in the flash memory, increasing the write amplification. In some of the SSDs from OCZ the background garbage collection clears up {{only a small number of}} blocks then stops, thereby limiting the amount of excessive writes. Another solution <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> efficient garbage collection system which can perform the necessary moves in parallel with the host writes. This solution is more effective in high write environments where the SSD is rarely idle. The SandForce SSD controllers and the systems from Violin Memory have this capability.|$|E

Twenty-one patients who <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> amputation of the lower extremity because of ischemic necrosis secondary to peripheral vascular disease {{were divided into two}} groups with use of a table of random numbers. Group A (the treatment group) included nine patients who <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> transtibial amputation, one patient who <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> disarticulation at the knee, and one patient who <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> transfemoral amputation.

25|$|Information assurance: The act of {{providing}} {{trust of the}} information, that the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) of the information are not violated, e.g. ensuring that data is not lost when critical issues arise.

25|$|Title x, Of Ecclesiastical Trials.-(i) Every diocese <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> episcopal tribunal.

This chapter describes the method to be employed in both instances.|$|E

2500|$|Hume divided all {{of human}} {{knowledge}} into two categories: relations {{of ideas and}} matters of fact (see also Kant's analytic-synthetic distinction). Mathematical and logical propositions (e.g. [...] "that {{the square of the}} hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two sides") are examples of the first, while propositions involving [...] some contingent observation of the world (e.g. [...] "the sun rises in the East") are examples of the second. All of people's [...] "ideas", in turn, are derived from their [...] "impressions". For Hume, an [...] "impression" [...] corresponds roughly with what we call a sensation. To remember or to imagine such impressions <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> [...] "idea". Ideas are therefore the faint copies of sensations.|$|E
2500|$|Most of Hume's {{followers}} have {{disagreed with}} his conclusion that belief in an external world is rationally unjustifiable, contending that Hume's own principles implicitly contained the rational justification {{for such a}} belief, that is, beyond being content to let the issue rest on human instinct, custom and habit. [...] According to an extreme empiricist theory known as phenomenalism, anticipated by the arguments of both Hume and George Berkeley, a physical object {{is a kind of}} construction out of our experiences. [...] Phenomenalism is the view that physical objects, properties, events (whatever is physical) are reducible to mental objects, properties, events. Ultimately, only mental objects, properties, events, exist â€” hence the closely related term subjective idealism. By the phenomenalistic line of thinking, to have a visual experience of a real physical thing <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> experience of a certain kind of group of experiences. [...] This type of set of experiences possesses a constancy and coherence that is lacking in the set of experiences of which hallucinations, for example, are a part. As John Stuart Mill put it in the mid-19th century, matter is the [...] "permanent possibility of sensation".|$|E
