This paper provides a preliminary {{review of the}} current state of evidence for the effect of <b>electronic</b> <b>whiteboards</b> on care processes and patient outcomes. A literature search was performed for the dates 1996 to 2014 on MEDLINE, EMBASE, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, and the ACM Digital Library. Thirteen papers, describing 11 studies, meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. The majority of studies took place in the Emergency Department. While studies looked at the impact of <b>electronic</b> <b>whiteboards</b> on the process of care, there is an absence of evidence concerning impact on patient outcomes. There is a need for robust research measuring the impact of <b>electronic</b> <b>whiteboards</b> on inpatient care...|$|R

Junkins professional history has seen him working in government (NASA), industry, and academia over a five decade career. Junkins' scholarship is documented in over 400 professional publications, including seven texts, 220 archival papers and several patents. His work has supported numerous spaceflight missions including the final three Apollo missions and his inventions have led to commercial products including navigation sensors for autonomous aerial refueling of aircraft, and for pointing navigation of spacecraft based on star pattern recognition. [...] He also patented an early <b>electronic</b> <b>whiteboard</b> in 1994 for use in computer conferencing and academic classrooms. He has directed over 120 graduate students, including 47 (as of March, 2012) who completed their PhD under his direction; his former students {{have given rise to}} three generations of PhD descendants.|$|E

Other computer-based technology including the <b>electronic</b> <b>whiteboard</b> [...] and the laptop computer became widely available to students. In 1990, the Methodist Ladies' College became the first campus to require every student to purchase a laptop. Governments around the world began to take notice of the effectiveness of this policy, and began financial initiatives to significantly increase the use of laptop computers in other colleges as well. In 1996, Bill Clinton made over $2 billion in grants available in the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund, a program which challenged schools to make computers available to every student, connected to the outside world, and engaging.

50|$|The MimioTeach {{interactive}} whiteboard system is typically {{attached to a}} whiteboard using magnets and to the teacher's PC via a USB connection or through MimioHub, a proprietary wireless USB link. The teacher's PC is then attached to a video projector. A MimioStylus pen is calibrated to the MimioTeach system {{using a combination of}} Ultrasound and Infrared to identify its location. Essentially ultrasonic pulses are timed as transmitted from the MimioStylus and received at two ultrasonic microphones on the MimioTeach. Through Trilateration the location of the stylus is determined, and the tracking data sent to the teacher's PC. The MimioStylus acts as a mouse to allow the user to manipulate the contents of their computer as its displayed on the dry erase board. Unlike traditional interactive board based technologies, such as Resistive Touch, the combination of ultrasound and infrared can scale from small whiteboards to very large ones. In another important differentiator, MimioTeach is portable rather than being a large, heavy <b>electronic</b> <b>whiteboard.</b>|$|E

40|$|As {{more and}} more Emergency Departments replace the manual dry-erase {{whiteboards}} used for coordination of patient care and communication among clinicians with IT-based <b>electronic</b> <b>whiteboards</b> a need to clarify the effects of implementing these systems arises. This paper seeks {{to answer this question}} by systematically reviewing studies on <b>electronic</b> <b>whiteboards.</b> The results of the review indicate that <b>electronic</b> <b>whiteboards</b> influence the work at Emergency Departments in various different ways e. g. changes to work practice and changes to whiteboard information accuracy. Also, the review finds that there are mediating factors that have an impact upon these effects e. g. display format and integration with other clinical IT systems. However, the results are somewhat inconclusive and of a mixed nature and therefore this paper calls for more focused and specific research...|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{whiteboards}} are replacing dry-erase whiteboards in many contexts. In {{this study}} we compare electronic and dry-erase whiteboards in emergency departments (EDs) with respect to reading distance and revision time.

For revision time, the <b>electronic</b> <b>whiteboard</b> is slower on one subtask {{but there is no}} difference on another subtask.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} evaluation of an educational software employing group competition using a large interactive <b>electronic</b> <b>whiteboard.</b> Group competition is a useful method to cultivate originality and communication skills. Sharing the same space and the same large screen, and face-to-face communication with others are very important for group competition. We have designed a kanji pairing software package using the interactive <b>electronic</b> <b>whiteboard.</b> Through experimental use of the application at two elementary schools, we confirmed the potential of this software to motivate children to learn and the necessity to adjust competitive factors according to children’s personalities. Moreover, the children kept their concentration and the teacher could get feedback of children’s study process. Therefore, the interactive <b>electronic</b> <b>whiteboard</b> and group competitive software can be effectively employed for classroom learning...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Electronic {{whiteboards}} {{are introduced}} at emergency departments (EDs) to improve work practices. This study investigates whether the time physicians and nurses at an ED spend in patient rooms versus at the control desk increases after {{the introduction of}} an <b>electronic</b> <b>whiteboard.</b> After using this whiteboard for four months nurses, but not physicians, spend more of their time with the patients. With the <b>electronic</b> <b>whiteboard,</b> nurses spend 28 % {{of their time in}} patient rooms and physicians 20 %. Importantly, the changes facilitated by the <b>electronic</b> <b>whiteboard</b> are also dependent on implementation issues, existing work practices, and the clinicians ’ experience. Another change in the work practices is distributed access to whiteboard information from the computers in patient rooms. A decrease in the mental workload of the coordinating nurse was envisaged but has not emerged.
