2500|$|Selma Blair as Liz Sherman: A pyrokinetic {{member of}} BPRD and Hellboy's girlfriend. Blair {{described}} her character as more {{engaging in the}} sequel, [...] "In the first one {{she was afraid to}} take a step. She was completely a zombie, not wanting to own up to her power and having the memory of what she'd created in her life... I was really eager to come and play Liz with a little more vibrancy." [...] Blair also had short hair for her role, avoiding long <b>hair</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> portrayal in the first film, which she felt [...] "brought her face down". The actress emphasized Liz Sherman's growth in the sequel, [...] "She's looking to the future much more, and things are happening in this one that she has to buck up... I think you're dealing with a lot knowing this young girl that we last saw as very damaged, and now she's with this guy, and all these people around her, I think, we've really had to step up a strength, and a confidence in her so that I don't look like the little baby kid sister tagging along." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Deed, thin, and I don't jist know--not exactly;" [...] and sinking {{lower down}} upon her haunches, she put {{up to her}} {{forehead}} the hand with which she had supported herself on the floor--the hand which was not occupied with the baby, and pushing back with it the loose <b>hairs</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> face, tried {{to make an effort}} at thinking.|$|R
60|$|She {{gripped his}} fingers tight, and laughed shakily. Then {{she dropped her}} hand. He put the <b>hair</b> back <b>from</b> <b>her</b> brows, {{stroking}} her temples, kissing them lightly.|$|R
60|$|She drew {{away and}} {{smoothed}} <b>her</b> ruffled <b>hair</b> back <b>from</b> <b>her</b> forehead, looking ruefully {{in the glass}} at her tear-stained cheeks, and down at the crushed violets in her corsage.|$|R
60|$|He {{kissed her}} again, and stroked the <b>hair</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> temples, gently, tenderly, {{as if she}} were a lover.|$|E
6000|$|... "Please {{turn the}} ship," [...] Nasha said excitedly. She pushed her dark <b>hair</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> face. [...] "Turn {{the ship and}} let's see what it is!" ...|$|E
60|$|A little wearily {{she pushed}} back {{the masses of}} <b>hair</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> forehead. Her head rested for a moment upon her fingers. Her eyes {{deliberately}} sought mine.|$|E
60|$|In {{the very}} {{midst of this}} awed silence the woman {{suddenly}} threw back her head, brushed the <b>hair</b> back <b>from</b> <b>her</b> face, and looked straight {{into the eyes of}} the Duke.|$|R
5000|$|Oak leafroller moths {{lay their}} eggs in July each year, in groups of 40 to 50. The female covers the eggs with <b>hairs</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> body; they are {{deposited}} on [...] "the base of large branches and rough bark patches on both tree trunks and limbs". The flat egg masses are white-gray in color and oval shaped, and are about 4.8 mm across. The eggs overwinter and hatch in spring of the next year. The larvae (or caterpillars) emerge in April and initially eat the buds of oak trees and young leaves inside them.|$|R
60|$|She put up {{her hand}} and {{smoothed}} back the curl. She was breathing fast and deep, {{as though she had}} been running, and with every breath perfume seemed to come <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>hair,</b> and <b>from</b> <b>her</b> body, like perfume from an opening flower.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} have," [...] he answered, gravely, {{and took her}} in his arms, and {{smoothed}} her <b>hair</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> forehead, and very tenderly kissed her lips.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And how glad {{we always}} are, Doll,' said her father, putting back the dark <b>hair</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> {{sparkling}} eyes, 'to have you at home. Give me a kiss.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh' I don't know," [...] she answered, wearily {{brushing}} <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> back <b>from</b> <b>her</b> eyes. [...] "It seemed {{best when}} I did it-and it can't be helped now." [...] There was infinite, dull despair and resignation in her voice.|$|R
6000|$|Then slowly, Ada got up {{from the}} bed and shook <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>from</b> off <b>her</b> face and wiped her eyes with her handkerchief. [...] "It must be so," [...] she said. [...] "Of course it must, as he wishes it. He must have all that he desires." ...|$|R

60|$|She {{pushed the}} tangled <b>hair</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> forehead, {{mechanically}} readjusting her cumbersome garments, then she stepped close {{up to the}} young Spaniard; {{she crossed her arms}} over her breast and looked him boldly in the eyes.|$|E

60|$|She rose, and, {{with a shrug}} of the {{shoulders}} and a quick, graceful movement, shook out her skirts, and pushed the <b>hair</b> back <b>from</b> <b>her</b> face. Then {{she held out her}} hand, and Paul found himself compelled, against his will, to stand by her side.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wilfrid, {{my early}} loved," [...] slowly gasped she, {{removing}} her gray <b>hair</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> furrowed temples, and gazing on her boy fondly, as he nestled on Ivanhoe's knee--"promise me, by St. Waltheof of Templestowe--promise me one boon!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Behave yourself, sir." [...] She {{tossed her}} head with a {{familiar}} backward motion to throw the chestnut <b>hair</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> face, {{and looked at him}} with eyes veiled slightly under their lashes. [...] "You will go with Kate and me?" ...|$|E

60|$|He {{might have}} added more than all, {{when he saw}} the face now looking at him. He did add it in effect, perhaps, as he softly moved her {{scattered}} <b>hair</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> forehead with his hand.

60|$|At {{last she}} lifted his arm, and drew {{herself out of}} the chair. Siegmund looked at her from his tranquillity.

60|$|She {{pushed the}} wavy <b>hair</b> back <b>from</b> <b>her</b> forehead--her eyes were bright, {{and there was}} a deep flush of colour in her cheeks. But the man was not to be deceived. He knew that these things were not for him. It was the {{accomplice}} she welcomed and not the man.|$|R
