5|$|Raised in {{a family}} {{concerned}} with social issues, in 2003 Gyllenhaal participated in an advertising campaign by the American Civil Liberties Union, an organization his entire family strongly supports. <b>Environmentally</b> <b>conscious,</b> he recycles regularly, and {{said in an interview}} that he spends $400 a year to have trees planted in a Mozambique forest, partly to promote the Future Forests program. After filming The Day After Tomorrow, he flew to the Arctic to promote awareness of climate change. Gyllenhaal is the Honorary Chair of the New Eyes for the Needy Advisory Board, and has signed on to help the TV fundraiser Stand Up to Cancer. Gyllenhaal is on the board of directors for the Anti-Recidivism Coalition and volunteered in California juvenile detention centers with Scott Budnick.|$|E
5|$|Some of the cleaner energy {{facilities}} in Boston include the Allston green district, with three ecologically compatible housing facilities. Boston is also breaking ground on multiple green affordable housing facilities {{to help reduce}} the carbon footprint of the city while simultaneously making these initiatives financially available to a greater population. Boston's climate plan is updated every three years and was most recently modified in 2013. This legislature includes the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance, which requires the city's larger buildings to disclose their yearly energy and water use statistics and partake in an energy assessment every five years. These statistics are made public by the city, thereby increasing incentives for buildings to be more <b>environmentally</b> <b>conscious.</b>|$|E

25|$|Tourism {{also has}} the {{potential}} to increase public appreciation of the environment and to spread awareness of environmental problems when it brings people into closer contact with the environment.

40|$|Petrakis and Xepapadeas (1996) {{proposed}} {{a system of}} self-financed transfers to expand the number of countries that sign an international environmental agreement. They also suggested a mechanism that detects cheating in those agreements when the emissions of an individual country cannot be observed by other countries. We show that this mechanism can easily be exploited if some <b>environmentally</b> less <b>conscious</b> countries collude. We propose a system of transfers which is sufficient to rule out such behaviour. It is demonstrated that side payments should be higher than those suggested by Petrakis and Xepapadeas if countries differ considerably in their environmental consciousness. Moreover, it is less likely that a system of self-financed transfers exists. ...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{the company}} was first {{launched}} officially in September 2008, founder Wade Watson started formulating Ruff&Cut in January 2007 when he became inspired to create a company that [...] "gives back" [...] after the attacks on September 11. He was already involved in the diamond mining trade, and thus decided to create a jewelry company with only conflict-free diamonds and recycled metals of 18k gold and sterling silver. Watson put together a team of designers interested in creating <b>environmentally</b> and socially <b>conscious</b> jewelry designs such as Todd Reed and Me&Ro and launched the official website containing all of the designs in September 2008.|$|R
5000|$|The Work Less Party is a {{political}} party in the Canadian province of British Columbia. The party was founded in 2003 by Conrad Schmidt.

50|$|During the telecast, former U.S. Vice President and {{environmental}} activist Al Gore, and Best Actor nominee Leonardo DiCaprio announced that AMPAS would incorporate several <b>environmentally</b> and ecologically <b>conscious</b> features into the ceremony. Designed by Frank Webb and Matthew White, the Architectural Digest greenroom where presenters and winners mingled backstage featured several environmentally friendly {{features such as}} a rug made of recycled plastic bottles and walls painted without any volatile organic compounds. Other eco-friendly features included the transportation for guests of the awards via hybrid electric vehicles, usage of recyclable paper for ballots and invitations, and serving meals at the Governor's Ball on reusable plates and biodegradable dishware.|$|R
25|$|Cooling the {{building}} in an <b>environmentally</b> <b>conscious</b> way was also a challenge. During the summer, Yellowknife's days get as long as its winter nights, making it the sunniest Canadian city during that season. In 20 hours of daylight with only four-hour white nights to provide respite, the overuse of air conditioning frequently leads to brownouts {{and as many as}} 50 power outages a year. The engineers compensated by adding the louvered steel shades to the south end of {{the building}}.|$|E
25|$|Mahlum Architects {{designed}} {{the new facility}} which includes only private patient rooms. Skanska USA served as the general contractor for construction. <b>Environmentally</b> <b>conscious</b> amenities include advanced HVAC systems, natural light in all patient rooms, and windows treated for improved heat transfer resistance. Other items that helped obtain LEED certification were the use of recycled construction material, a system for utilizing storm water, use of environmentally friendly housecleaning products, and purchasing 100% wind generated electricity. Much of the artwork at the hospital was created by area school kids.|$|E
25|$|The final {{government}} regulation towards increased demand is recycled product labeling. When producers {{are required to}} label their packaging with amount of recycled material in the product (including the packaging), consumers {{are better able to}} make educated choices. Consumers with sufficient buying power can then choose more <b>environmentally</b> <b>conscious</b> options, prompt producers {{to increase the amount of}} recycled material in their products, and indirectly increase demand. Standardized recycling labeling can also have a positive effect on supply of recyclates if the labeling includes information on how and where the product can be recycled.|$|E
40|$|Placencia Village {{is one of}} Belize’s leading “eco-destinations,” due to its sandy-white beaches, coral reefs, and {{wildlife}} sanctuaries. While the use of “green washing,” the process of deceptively marketing products, aims or policies as being environmentally friendly, {{has proven to be}} effective in attracting consumers who are thought to be <b>environmentally</b> and socially <b>conscious,</b> the exponential growth, coupled with the absence of established policies, represents a significant threat to Belize. This thesis examines the political-ecologic dimensions of rapid tourism expansion in Southern Belize by investigating how the health of the biophysical environment is perceived, what processes are responsible for change, and how these changes are impacting the socioeconomic livelihoods of the local people...|$|R
40|$|At {{the retreat}} center in San Juan Bautista, {{run by the}} Franciscan brothers, there is a dry pond {{that at one time}} was full of water. Over time, however, the pond has lost water due to the effects of the California drought. In order to bring back the {{aesthetics}} of the St. Francis Retreat Center and restore the habitat, this project allows for the design of a pump and piping system that will bring water from a well and recharge the pond, working in tandem with another senior design group for the water purification of the well. The proposed solution is an <b>environmentally</b> and economically <b>conscious</b> design, which will efficiently bring water from the well and recharge the pond, restoring the peaceful aesthetics for the retreat community...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the blog}} [...] "has spurred an outpouring {{from those who}} view it as {{offensive}} and racist", {{it is not about}} the interests of all white people, but rather a stereotype of affluent, <b>environmentally</b> and socially <b>conscious,</b> anti-corporate white North Americans, who typically hold a degree in the liberal arts. Lander claims to be lampooning contemporary versions of bohemian/hipster culture, and jokingly refers to other classes and subcultures of white people as [...] "the wrong kind of white people". Despite the site's satirical edge, Lander regards the people he describes with affection and numbers himself among them, describing himself as [...] "a self-aware, left-wing person who's not afraid to recognize the selfishness and contradictions that come on the left". The initialism [...] "SWPL" [...] has been adopted in some circles as a (usually pejorative) shorthand term for the type of people depicted on the blog.|$|R
