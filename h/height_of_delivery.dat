2500|$|The bowler's end umpire {{initially}} {{signals a}} foot-fault No ball by holding one arm out horizontally and calling [...] "No Ball", which may give the batsman some {{warning that the}} ball is an illegal delivery. Depending on {{the reason for the}} call (and hence its timing), the speed of the delivery and the batsman's reactions, the batsman may then be able to play a more aggressive shot at the delivery, safe in the knowledge that he cannot be dismissed. Other reasons for a No ball, e.g. illegal position of fielder, throwing the ball, or <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery,</b> are initially judged by the square leg umpire, who indicates his judgement to the bowler's end umpire.|$|E
50|$|Crosses are {{primarily}} {{used to create}} goal-scoring efforts, and form an important repertoire of counter-attacking tactics and wing-play. Players in wide positions, usually wingers, wingbacks and fullbacks, deliver {{the ball into the}} penalty box, close to the opponent's goal. Team-mates in the central positions, typically forwards, attempt to volley or deflect the delivered ball with their head or feet, depending on the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>delivery,</b> towards the goal and hopefully scoring.|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Damage of any {{element of}} pelvic floor leads to its {{functional}} damages, {{reflected in the}} occurrence of urinary incontinence, prolapse of pelvic organs, fecal incontinence and sexual dysfunction. Basic aim of our paper {{was to investigate the}} influence of various risk factors on pelvic floor muscle strength in women. Methods. The study included 90 female patients and examined how age, job, body weight and <b>height,</b> number <b>of</b> <b>deliveries,</b> sports activities, incontinence occurrence, previous prolapse-caused gynecological surgeries, other gynecological surgeries and other conservatively treated gynecological diseases influence the value of pelvic floor muscle strength. Pelvic floor muscle strength was measured using vaginal dynamometer. Results. Univariate regression analysis showed that parameters such as age, demanding job, body <b>height,</b> number <b>of</b> <b>deliveries,</b> sports activities, prolapse-caused gynecological surgeries, other gynecological surgeries and other gynecological diseases were in positive correlation with the values of pelvic floor muscle strength. In multivariate regression model, incontinence and gynecological operation of prolapse were singled out as independent risk factors. Conclusion. If risk factors that cause damage to pelvic floor muscle are known, it is possible to prevent the damages and improve the quality of women's life...|$|R
25|$|The Oct 2017 Law changes {{removed the}} need for {{repetition}} before calling a No ball for dangerous or unfair short-pitched bowling (bouncers), set the limit for beamers in all cricket at waist <b>height,</b> regardless <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> speed, and treat a deliberate front foot No ball as 'dangerous or unfair,' with immediate sanctions as for a deliberate beamer. There will only be a first and final warning for throwing. There is now an explicit penalty for underarm bowling. Interception of the ball by a fielder before it reaches the batsman became an explicit No Ball. Bye and Leg bye extras are now be scored as such, rather than as No ball extras.|$|R
40|$|Two studies {{evaluated}} the effects <b>of</b> response-independent water <b>deliveries</b> {{on the location}} (on {{the floor of the}} experimental chamber) and position (<b>height)</b> <b>of</b> rats' behavior. In both experiments, fixed-time schedules delivered water in two dispensers that were located at opposite ends of the chamber. In Experiment 1, the two schedules provided complementary frequencies <b>of</b> water <b>deliveries</b> while the overall number <b>of</b> <b>deliveries</b> stayed constant. In Experiment 2, one of the schedules delivered water twice as frequently as the other; this proportion was kept constant while the overall density <b>of</b> water <b>deliveries</b> changed systematically. In both experiments, a single position (<b>height)</b> <b>of</b> behavior was dominant. Also, the percentage of time allocated to each dispenser was roughly proportional to the percentage <b>of</b> water <b>deliveries</b> associated with the dispensers. These data and additional considerations support the importance of examining the spatial properties and patterning of behavior...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if carbon dioxide laser conization of the cervix {{is a risk}} factor for preterm delivery in subsequent gestations and to evaluate whether there is any relationship between cone <b>height</b> and duration <b>of</b> pregnancy. Methods: Patients of fertile age who had carbon dioxide laser conization were followed for reproductive events. Cases were matched one-to- one with controls for known risk factors for preterm delivery. Pregnancy duration, rate of preterm birth, and mode <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> were studied. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used for statistical analysis. Logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazard modeling were used to investigate the relationship between cone height and subsequent preterm delivery. Results: Sixty-four women with singleton pregnancies after carbon dioxide laser conization and 64 controls were included in the study. Overall, no difference was found in the rate <b>of</b> preterm <b>delivery</b> and duration <b>of</b> pregnancy. However, women with cone <b>height</b> <b>of</b> at least 10 mm had a higher rate <b>of</b> preterm <b>delivery</b> than either those with cone height less than 10 mm (five of 23 versus one of 41, P =. 01) or the controls (five of 23 versus three of 64, P <. 05). Cone <b>height</b> <b>of</b> at least 10 mm remained significant in predicting the occurrence <b>of</b> preterm <b>delivery</b> and the duration of pregnancy after adjusting for known risk factors (odds ratio 11. 1, P <. 05). Conclusion: Cone <b>height</b> <b>of</b> at least 10 mm is an independent risk factor for the duration of pregnancy and for the occurrence <b>of</b> preterm <b>delivery</b> in the subsequent gestation...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of image analysis {{has been used}} to assess the quality of model oriented strand board panels by investigating the relationships between shape and size of strands, the distribution of strands and bending properties. A batch of commercial strands was analysed by image analysis and the distribution of the shape and size of strands was quantified. The strands were categorised into five strand types as a function of size and aspect ratio. In general, strand shapes were observed to be mostly rectangular and there was also a wide variation in strand dimensions in commercial material. Bigger area strands had low aspect ratios and small strands had high aspect ratios. Half of the commercial strands were longer than 100 mm. Model OSB panels were manufactured in the laboratory by hot pressing strand mats formed from each of the five strand types. Strands were laid up by hand into the forming mat and following pressing the orientation and shape of strands was evaluated by image analysis and the panels were tested in a three point bending. Large area (type 3) strands with high aspect ratios produced model panels with optimum strand orientation and mechanical properties. Type 3 panels were also fabricated from strands dropped through a slotted forming device in order to simulate the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> strands to the forming line under factory conditions. As the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> strand <b>delivery</b> increased from 0 to 100 to 200 mm the disorientation of strands in the pressed panels progressively increased and as a result mechanical properties in bending were reduced. Image analysis is therefore a powerful tool for evaluating the distribution of commercial strand shapes and the relationship between strand geometry, strand orientation and the mechanical properties of oriented strand board...|$|R

25|$|A yorker ball {{bounces off}} the pitch {{right in front}} of (or is aimed at the toes of) the batsman's feet, an area known as the block hole.
