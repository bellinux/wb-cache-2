5|$|Between 1793 and 1800 the Grand <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal</b> was built, {{connecting}} London to the Midlands. The canal {{followed the}} course of the River Bulbourne through the Chilterns, and included a branch to Aylesbury. For the first time the coal and industrial products of northern England and London could be cheaply supplied to Buckinghamshire, and grain and timber from Buckinghamshire's farms could easily be shipped to market. The route taken by the Grand <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal</b> ran through the east of the county, leaving the Chiltern towns of southern Buckinghamshire isolated. When Robert Stephenson's London and Birmingham Railway opened in 1838 it paralleled the route of the canal through Buckinghamshire. Although the short 1839 Aylesbury Railway linked Aylesbury to the London and Birmingham Railway, the rest of central Buckinghamshire remained unconnected to the railway and canal networks.|$|E
5|$|The New <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal</b> and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal {{leave the}} end of the River Don Navigation, and both head broadly north east, but whereas the New <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal</b> {{continues}} in a straight line for its entire length, the Stainforth and Keadby gradually turns to the east. Shortly after the junction, Bramwith Lock lowers the level of the canal. The River Don, after flowing under the New <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal,</b> joins the canal and continues close to the north bank for several miles. Bramwith Swing Bridge is the first of several swing bridges, most of which are operated by boaters. The tiny village of Kirk Bramwith is just {{to the north of the}} canal and river. Its notable buildings include the church of St Mary, much of which dates from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, with a twelfth-century southern doorway. The building is a grade II* listed structure. The hamlet of South Bramwith lies to the south, with Bramwith Hall, a grade II listed 3-storey, 5-bay eighteenth-century country house, which was rebuilt in the early nineteenth century, situated close to the canal. The canal passes to the north of Stainforth, where there is a fixed bridge. A basin, with its former connection to the Don, is now used as moorings by Thorne Cruising Club. This first section is now generally considered to be part of the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, although it was originally part of the Don Navigation as far as Stainforth Lock.|$|E

5|$|Profitability was maintained, {{with the}} result then {{when most of the}} Shropshire Union network of canals were {{abandoned}} in 1944, the sections which had originally been the Chester Canal, the Ellesmere Canal, the Birmingham and Liverpool <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal</b> and the Middlewich Branch were all retained. The only other section which was not abandoned was the Llangollen branch; this was kept because of its function as a water supply channel, rather than for navigation.|$|E
5|$|The Ellesmere Canal {{was also}} {{building}} branches in North Wales, which {{were intended to}} link up to the River Dee at Chester, but eventually linked to the Chester Canal at Hurleston Junction, just {{to the north of}} Nantwich, in 1805. The canal then became the middle section of a much longer and more profitable canal. The two companies merged in 1813, becoming the Ellesmere and Chester Canal. When the Birmingham and Liverpool <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal</b> was proposed in 1826, which would provide a link from Nantwich to Wolverhampton and the Birmingham canal system, the company saw it as an opportunity to build the Middlewich Branch, which would provide a connection to Manchester and the Potteries. The branch opened in 1833, and the <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal</b> opened in 1835. Amalgamation followed in 1845, with the new company retaining the name of the Ellesmere and Chester Canal. The following year, the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company was formed from the Ellesmere and Chester company, which also took over a number of canals which joined theirs. Plans to convert some of the canals to railways were put on hold in the 1847, when the canal company was leased to the London and North Western Railway. Under railway control, the canals continued to operate successfully, but decline set in during the 20th century, and when many of the adjoining canals were closed in 1944, the sections which had been the Ellesmere and Chester Canal and the Birmingham and Liverpool <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal,</b> together with the Middlewich Branch, were retained.|$|E

5|$|The Grand <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal</b> {{opened in}} 1794, linking Uxbridge with Birmingham. By 1800 Uxbridge {{had become one}} of the most {{important}} market towns in Middlesex, helped by its status as the first stopping point for stagecoaches travelling from London to Oxford. The development of Uxbridge declined after the opening of the Great Western Railway in 1838, which passed through West Drayton. A branch line to Uxbridge was not built until 1904.|$|E
5|$|The Grand <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal</b> {{came through}} the area between 1793 and 1800, with canal-side wharfs in Fenny Stratford, Great Linford, Bradwell and Wolverton. The route {{bypassed}} Newport Pagnell but, in 1817, an arm was dug to it from Great Linford. Trade along the canal stimulated the local economy. A large brickworks was established near the canal in Great Linford: two bottle kilns and the clay pits can still {{be seen on the}} site. Pottery from the Midlands begins to appear in excavations of dwellings from that period.|$|E
5|$|The Newport Pagnell Canal {{had opened}} in 1817 between the Grand <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal</b> at Great Linford and Newport Pagnell. The canal carried a {{reasonable}} level of traffic, but in 1845, the LNWR attempted {{to buy the}} canal, using it for a potential railway line. The offer was refused for two decades, until 1862, when the LNWR was able to purchase the canal for £9000. The canal closed in 1864. Despite this, the railway when built did not run on {{the line of the}} old canal.|$|E

5|$|The Basingstoke {{committee}} then investigated {{a link to}} the Andover Canal, but in December 1792, interest switched back to a {{link with}} the Itchen. A meeting was held in Southampton, which was chaired by the mayor and included James D'Arcy on the committee. It became part of a much grander scheme to link Bristol to Salisbury, and onwards to London, but although most of this soon died away, the Itchen to Basingstoke link was still being considered in 1796, by which time it was called the London and Southampton Ports <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal.</b> Two routes were surveyed by different engineers, one costing £127,000 and the other £157,566.|$|E
5|$|The {{network was}} {{expanded}} by {{the opening of}} the Stainforth and Keadby Canal in 1802, linking to the River Trent, the Dearne and Dove Canal in 1804, linking to Barnsley, and the Sheffield Canal in 1819, which provided better access to Sheffield. All three were bought out by the Don Navigation in the 1840s, after which the canals were owned by a series of railway companies. The Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company was created in 1889 and eventually succeeded in buying back the canals and the Don Navigation in 1895, but plans for expansion were hampered by a lack of capital. One success was {{the opening of the}} New <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal</b> in 1905, jointly funded with the Aire and Calder Navigation.|$|E
5|$|The Aire and Calder still fulfils its {{original}} purpose of linking Leeds and Wakefield with York and the Humber (and thence the Trent), although the routes by which this is achieved have changed significantly. More recent canals now {{also make the}} Navigation a vital link in the English and Welsh connected inland waterway network. Beyond Leeds, the Leeds and Liverpool Canal carries boats over the Pennines. The Calder and Hebble Navigation, which connects to the Navigation at Wakefield, allows boats to reach the Huddersfield Broad and Narrow Canals, and the Rochdale Canal. The Selby Canal connects to the Ouse, from where boats can travel upstream to reach York, Boroughbridge and Ripon, or downstream to the River Derwent. Beyond Goole are the Humber and hence Hull, Immingham, and the North Sea. The Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation, which {{can be reached via}} the New <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal,</b> forms a link with Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield to the south west, and the tidal River Trent at Keadby to the east.|$|E

These two {{sections}} of the river are linked to each other, and to the Canal du Midi to the west, by short <b>junction</b> <b>canals</b> and the famous Agde Round Lock.|$|R
5|$|The canal {{is popular}} with {{pleasure}} boaters, {{as much of}} it is pleasantly rural, with added interest provided by the city of Chester and Ellesmere Port with its waterways museum. The towpath through Chester provides an attractive route for walkers. The canal is well connected, with links to the Trent and Mersey Canal via the Middlewich Branch to the east, the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal via the former Birmingham and Liverpool <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal</b> to the south, and provides a route to the Llangollen Canal, from which the Montgomeryshire Canal, which is the subject of an ongoing restoration scheme, can be accessed. Boaters can also access the River Dee at Chester, although advance notice must be given, and the river is only accessible for four hours either side of high tide. At Ellesmere Port, the canal has connected to the Manchester Ship Canal since its opening in 1894. For many leisure cruisers, the requirements of the ship canal company for taking small boats onto a large commercial waterway are too daunting, and Ellesmere Port acts as the end of their journey.|$|E
5|$|One {{improvement}} {{that was}} completed was {{the construction of}} the New <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal.</b> This had been authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained on 28 July 1891 by the Aire and Calder Navigation, which specified that the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company would share the cost of construction and the ownership of the new waterway. No work could start until the company actually owned their canals, and they were required to raise £150,000 {{at a time when they}} had just failed to raise the finance for the takeover of the original canals. However, three-quarters of the cost had been raised by 1903. The new canal leaves the original navigation at Bramwith Junction, runs over the River Don on an aqueduct, and continues in a straight line for , to join the Aire and Calder Navigation upstream from Goole. It provided a much more direct route from Sheffield to Goole, and was opened on 2 January 1905. The company had hoped to run compartment boats for the transport of coal along the canal, as the Aire and Calder did, but although straightening of the navigation was completed at Doncaster in April 1905 and at Sprotborough in late 1907, and Doncaster Town Lock was lengthened in 1909 and 1910, most of the locks could only hold three compartments at a time, and so there was little advantage to using this type of boat.|$|E
5|$|The early 19th century saw the {{completion}} of a number of canals which linked to the Don. The first was the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, which had been proposed by the Don Navigation shareholders in 1792. Construction was started in 1793 and completed in 1802, with John Thompson, the engineer to the Don Navigation Company, overseeing the work until his death in 1795. It provided a link from Bramwith Lock to the River Trent, broadly following the old course of the River Don prior to Vermuyden's improvements. Two years later, the Dearne and Dove Canal opened, connecting with the Barnsley Canal near Barnsley. The canal had also been proposed by Don Navigation shareholders in 1792, and again John Thompson had overseen the initial construction. The third opening was in 1819, when the Sheffield Canal connected the Tinsley terminus to the centre of Sheffield. There were several plans to create a link to the Chesterfield Canal, including one in 1793 by Benjamin Outram, and a proposal by Richard Gresley in 1810 for a North East <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal,</b> which would have linked to the Don at Rotherham, broadly following the modern ideas for the Rother Link. Neither of these, nor a revival of the idea in 1832 gained sufficient support to proceed.|$|E

25|$|With {{plans to}} link Nantwich to the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Autherley, {{to create the}} Birmingham and Liverpool <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal,</b> talks were again held with the Trent and Mersey Canal about a canal from Barbridge to Middlewich. The Trent and Mersey refused to {{consider}} the idea until the Birmingham and Liverpool <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal</b> was authorised, and then insisted that the canal should join a short branch from their canal, which they would build. This would become the Wardle Canal, and goods transferred along it had to pay high compensation tolls. The canal was authorised in 1827, {{one year after the}} Birmingham and Liverpool <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal,</b> and it was opened on 1 September 1833. The total cost, which included wharves and warehouses at Barbridge Junction, was £129,000, but trade was meagre until the new link to Autherley was completed some three years later.|$|E
25|$|A {{much more}} direct route between London and the Midlands, the Grand <b>Junction</b> <b>Canal,</b> was {{completed}} in 1805.

This greatly reduced Oxford Canal traffic south of Napton.
