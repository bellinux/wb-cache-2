Such a separation of loanwords into two distinct categories is not used by linguists in English in talking about any language. In addition, basing such a separation mainly on spelling as described in the illustration is (or, in fact, was) not usually done except by German linguists and only when talking about German and sometimes other languages that tend to adapt foreign spellings, which is rare in English unless the word has been in wide use for a very long time.|$|E

2500|$|Moreover, the {{original}} {{meanings of the}} symbols were different in numerous aspects. The eagle was {{a representation of the}} sun god Huitzilopochtli, who was very important, as the Mexicas referred to themselves as the [...] "People of the Sun". The cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica), full of its fruits, called [...] "nochtli" [...] in Nahuatl, represent the island of Tenochtitlan. To the Mexicas, the snake represented wisdom, and it had strong connotations with the god Quetzalcoatl. The story of the snake was derived from an <b>incorrect</b> <b>translation</b> of the Crónica mexicáyotl by Fernando Alvarado Tezozómoc. In the story, the Nahuatl text ihuan cohuatl izomocayan, [...] "the snake hisses", was mistranslated as [...] "the snake is torn". Based on this, Father Diego Durán reinterpreted the legend so that the eagle represents all that is good and right, while the snake represents evil and sin. Despite its inaccuracy, the new legend was adopted because it conformed with European heraldic tradition. To the Europeans it would represent the struggle between good and evil. Although this interpretation does not conform to pre-Columbian traditions, it was an element that could be used by the first missionaries for the purposes of evangelism and the conversion of the native peoples.|$|E

40|$|How can beginners acquire {{vocabulary}} from context (e. g., through reading) {{if they do}} {{not know}} enough words? A common technique for teaching new words to beginners is through pictures. Although there is some research in this area, it is unclear how well beginners internalize words taught through pictures. This study's objective was to examine the effectiveness of pictures in word learning by using measures of form and meaning processing. Eighteen English true beginners of Spanish and 18 native Spanish speakers first studied 26 novel Spanish concrete nouns briefly presented three times with pictures, and then performed two reaction-timed tasks. In episodic recognition (form processing), they saw the 24 target words (and 24 foils) and indicated which words they had seen during study. In translation recognition (meaning processing), they saw the target 24 words paired with either correct, semantically associated, or <b>incorrect</b> English <b>translations,</b> and indicated whether the translation was correct or not. In the episodic recognition task, the beginners and the native speakers were equally fast in recognizing recently studied words. In the translation task, beginners learned the 24 words to a high degree of accuracy (86 % correct), and both groups were slower in responding to semantically associated <b>translations</b> than to <b>incorrect</b> <b>translations.</b> These results show that the learners could access both the forms and the meanings of novel words, and suggest that the use of pictures is a quick and efficient technique for committing words to memory...|$|R
