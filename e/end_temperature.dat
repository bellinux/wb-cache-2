The control objective of a heat exchanger network is to control the temperature out of the heat exchanger network within a certain range.

There seem to be no simple systematic ways to maximize the <b>end</b> <b>temperature</b> and the practical solutions are often suboptimal.

40|$|Background: Intralesional (IL) {{cryotherapy}} is a {{new technique}} {{for the treatment of}} keloid scars, in which the scar is frozen from inside. Two cryodevices are available, which were recently evaluated. Both devices showed promising results, but differed in clinical outcome. To explain these differences, more understanding of the working mechanism of both devices is required. Objective: This experimental study was designed to investigate and compare the thermal behavior of an argon gas- and a liquid nitrogen-based device. Thermal behavior constitutes: (1) minimum tissue temperature (°C), (2) the freezing rate (°C/min). The thermal behavior was measured inside and on the outer surface of the scar. Both devices were tested ex vivo and in vivo. Results: Ex vivo, when determining the maximum freezing capacity, the argon gas device showed a higher <b>end</b> <b>temperature</b> compared to the liquid nitrogen device (argon gas: - 120. °C, liquid nitrogen: - 140. °C) and a faster freezing rate (argon gas: - 1300. °C/min, liquid nitrogen: - 145. °C/min). In vivo, measured inside the keloid, the argon gas device showed a lower <b>end</b> <b>temperature</b> than the liquid nitrogen device (argon gas: - 36. 4. °C, liquid nitrogen: - 8. 1. °C) and a faster freezing rate (argon gas: - 14. 7. °C/min, liquid nitrogen: - 5. °C/min).

Conclusion: In conclusion, the argon gas device displayed a lower <b>end</b> <b>temperature</b> and a faster freezing rate in vivo compared to the liquid nitrogen device. Although this resulted in lower recurrence rates for the argon gas device, more hypopigmentation was seen compared to the liquid nitrogen device following treatment.

However, development of durable phantoms with high precision ability to represent the temperature distribution remains a challenge. This study aims to introduce a reusable phantom that provides an accurate assessment of the heated region in various thermal modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The phantom contains a thermochromic dye that is transparent blue at room temperature and becomes colourless after exceeding a threshold temperature. In {{order to determine the}} threshold temperature of the phantom, spectrophotometry analysis was performed. The various thermal (specific heat, thermal conductivity, melting point and latent heat of melting) and acoustic (sound speed, attenuation) properties of this phantom were measured and compared with those of the reference phantom without dye. The application of this phantom for radio-frequency and magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound modalities was also examined. RESULTS: The spectrophotometry analysis showed a threshold temperature of 50 ± 3 °C for this phantom. The results also demonstrated a 6 °C difference between the onset and <b>ending</b> <b>temperatures</b> of the discolouration process. Moreover, the starting temperature of colouration during cooling was found to be 4 °C lower than the <b>ending</b> <b>temperature</b> of discolouration. The sound speed, attenuation, specific heat, thermal conductivity and melting point of the heat-sensitive phantom were statistically equal to those of the reference phantom; however, the latent heat, and onset temperature of the melting of the heat-sensitive phantom were decreased by addition of the dye. CONCLUSIONS: The developed phantom is applicable for accurate evaluation of temperature variations in various thermal modalities. ...|$|R
