In 1830 he met Joseph Cafasso, a young priest who identified some natural talent and supported his first schooling. In 1835 Bosco entered the seminary at Chieri, next to the Church of the Immacolata Concezione. In 1841, after six years of study, he was ordained priest on the eve of Trinity Sunday by Archbishop Franzoni of Turin.|$|E

The tears would run plentifully down my face when I made these reflections; and sometimes I would expostulate with myself, why Providence should thus completely ruin his creatures, and render them so absolutely miserable, so without <b>help</b> <b>abandoned,</b> so entirely depressed, that it could hardly be rational to be thankful for such a life.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in the 1960s, {{feminism}} {{began to}} appear in many forms of media because of the social changes that were taking place at the time. Specifically, children's books are one form of media that feminists began to use to spread a better understanding of feminism and the stereotypes of women. As children are a main target of the influential stereotypes of patriarchal mass media and important receptors of literature, they can be influenced by feminist literature to <b>help</b> <b>abandon</b> any learned stereotypes. Since second-wave feminism, children's literature is being influenced by feminist theory and ideals since second-wave feminism, and is still growing as an influential media source in literature in today's society.|$|R

In the other hand, some people also use religious beliefs as an excuse. Based on those phenomenon,the author then designed a shelter and café where not only to accommodate abandoned animals but also find the owner for the dog. So the café is designed to be useful as a gathering place for animal lovers and provide campaigns to adopt dogs. In this design there are also supporting facilities such as clinic, nursery, playgrounds and office to organize dog adoption procedures.

In the theoretical part, the author relies on the theory of constructing the identity of the animal's role in sociology and in our society. This thesis processes seven qualitative interviews with people who care for abandoned animals within specific organizations. The practical part is, except for introducing the institution and consultants, focused on the data analysis. The caregiver's relationship with animals began to form during childhood and further tightened through their <b>help</b> <b>abandoned</b> animals. This relationship had an impact that they decided to fully focus on taking care of animals in a particular shelter. This expirience was the reason to create new abilities and attitudes that are necessary for doing this work effectively. Aspecially emotional detachment and accepting the fact that you cannot save every animal. It also {{had an impact on the}} social aspects of the caregiver in terms of interaction with other people and worsening relations them. Human is perceived the reason why animals [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Various {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to solve a challenging architecturallayout design problem for more than a decade, such as an expert system, an evolutionary algorithm, a simulated annealing and a mathematical programming method. This paper concentrates on the mathematical programming technique that formulates an architectural layout design optimization as the mixed integer programming model using the state-of-the art optimization solver to determine the optimal solution. All non-linear relationships among design components are captured using the corresponding linear equalities and linear in- equalities. Due to the combinatorial nature of the MIP solutions, the MIP can be solved for small problem sizes, 2 - 6 rooms, within a reasonable time limit. To remedy this situation, the valid inequality of non-circular connections has been adopted that reduces the computational time significantly. Moreover, the guided constraints based on the architect’s preferences of a specific room have been embraced. This <b>helps</b> <b>abandon</b> some alternative solutions and reduced the search space considerably. The computational time and iterations gain of more than 80 % is now achievable for the architectural layout design for 7 - 10 rooms...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the institutional frames of social work in Uganda and to discuss their possible consequences for the professional-client relationship. Theoretically our analysis draws on two different perspectives, which we have chosen to call “promoting formal frames in social work” and “promoting relation-based social work”. Empirically the analysis is based on a case study of an NGO in Kampala, Uganda, which works with <b>helping</b> <b>abandoned</b> pregnant teenagers. In this study, a qualitative approach is employed which makes use of method triangulation by combining interviews, participant observations and document analysis. The results indicate that our professional informants experience relation-based social work with weak formal frames. These settings seem to promote flexibility and to allow for the adoption of an individual perspective for each client. On the other hand legal rights for clients seem to be nonexistent and decisions apparently have a risk to be made out of arbitrariness. The conclusion of this study is that social work in Uganda is regulated by other frames than formal ones. It seems impossible to execute social work without any institutional frames. With less formal regulation there is more room for informal norms to affect social work. In the Ugandan context certain religious and cultural norms seem to have a major influence...|$|R
