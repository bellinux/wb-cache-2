The album featured bandmate McLagan {{as well as}} former Beatle George Harrison and Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, {{a longtime friend of}} Wood's. Richards soon invited Wood to join the Rolling Stones, after the departure of Mick Taylor. Wood joined in 1975 and has remained a member ever since.|$|E

500|$|Adultery was {{the subject}} matter of Harrison's non-album B-side from this period, [...] "I Don't Care Anymore", and his musical {{association}} with Ron Wood led to the song [...] "Far East Man". This co-composition was first recorded for Wood's debut solo album, I've <b>Got</b> <b>My</b> <b>Own</b> Album to Do, and when released on Dark Horse, it marked the first foray into soul music within Harrison's solo work.|$|E
500|$|... "Far East Man" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} English musicians George Harrison and Ronnie Wood, each of whom {{released}} a recording of the song in 1974. Wood's version appeared on I've <b>Got</b> <b>My</b> <b>Own</b> Album to Do, his debut solo album, and Harrison's on Dark Horse. Their only official songwriting collaboration, [...] "Far East Man" [...] is an affirmation of friendship {{in the face of}} life's obstacles and musically reflects the two guitarists' adoption of the soul genre. Written mostly by Harrison, the composition has been interpreted as a restatement of the humanitarian message expressed in his 1971 single [...] "Bangla Desh", and a tribute to Indian musician Ravi Shankar.|$|E
500|$|In Ronnie, his 2007 autobiography, Wood {{writes that}} The Wick was [...] "a hive of {{recording}} activity {{as well as}} a thriving debauchery camp" [...] during the year-long creation of his first solo release, I've <b>Got</b> <b>My</b> <b>Own</b> Album to Do (1974). The album title originated from contributors such as Harrison and Mick Jagger [...] "nagging me to let them go home" [...] and work on their own projects. Wood assisted Jagger in writing and recording the Rolling Stones' 1974 single [...] "It's Only Rock 'n Roll" [...] during this period, and he similarly reciprocated Harrison, by playing on the former Beatle's Christmas single, [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong".|$|E

500|$|McCartney {{primarily}} flatpicks {{while playing}} acoustic guitar, though he also uses elements of fingerpicking. Examples of his acoustic guitar playing on Beatles tracks include [...] "Yesterday", [...] "I'm Looking Through You", [...] "Michelle", [...] "Blackbird", [...] "I Will", [...] "Mother Nature's Son" [...] and [...] "Rocky Raccoon". McCartney singled out [...] "Blackbird" [...] {{as a personal}} favourite and described his technique for the guitar part in the following way: [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> little sort of cheating way of ... I'm actually sort of pulling two strings at a time... I was trying to emulate those folk players." [...] He employed a similar technique for [...] "Jenny Wren". He played an Epiphone Texan on many of his acoustic recordings, but also used a Martin D-28.|$|E
500|$|The basic {{track for}} [...] "So Sad" [...] was taped at FPSHOT with Phil McDonald as the {{recording}} engineer. Aside from Harrison, the musicians included Hopkins (on piano) and Starr and Keltner (on drums). According to Starr's comments in a contemporary interview, the session {{took place in}} November 1973; while confirming this date {{in a press conference}} the following year, Harrison said that Voormann also participated on bass. The bass part was subsequently overdubbed by Willie Weeks, whom Harrison first met in June 1974 while they were both working on Wood's first solo album, I've <b>Got</b> <b>My</b> <b>Own</b> Album to Do. Harrison played a wide range of instruments on the song. Credited as [...] "guitars and the other things", these include 12-string acoustic guitars, electric piano and slide-guitar parts.|$|E
500|$|After {{revealing}} their deception to a busy Queen Victoria public house, Peggy slapped both Pat and Frank, rebuffed Frank's {{attempt at}} reconciliation {{and left him}} to depart alone. In December 2000, Ian Hyland of the Sunday Mirror voted the scene in which Peggy slaps both Pat and Frank {{as one of the}} [...] "TV fights of the year", saying [...] "It was Peggy's speech which really made it a Bonfire Night to remember. But the slaps were equally well dispatched." [...] Commenting on Reid's exit, Windsor has said, [...] "We fell out when I found out he was leaving because it was a shock for me. I was really upset. I've known him 30 odd years and I really like working with him. We had a great relationship as friends as well as performers. I <b>got</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> back when I had to slap him after I found out he was fooling around with Pat. I did the slap twice as I didn't think I did it hard enough the first time." ...|$|E

500|$|Along with Jim Miller's {{opinions}} in Rolling Stone magazine, Woffinden's 1974 album review for the NME {{was one of}} the most scathing critiques. Woffinden bemoaned how on Dark Horse, [...] "the radiant light of George's spirituality is planted firmly under a bushel and darkness is not confined to equine matters". He then wrote of the song: [...] " [...] seems to have most chance of independent survival, especially as the song turned up in quite pleasant shape on Wood's I've <b>Got</b> <b>My</b> <b>Own</b> Album To Do, but here again the production effectively smothers it, and Harrison's drab vocals complete the assassination." [...] By contrast, Michael Gross of Circus Raves magazine viewed the album as the equal of Harrison's acclaimed All Things Must Pass (1970) and praised the song and its arrangement, writing: [...] "Scott again excels on 'Far East Man', with a horn solo that would vindicate any context in which it was put." [...] In a similarly positive assessment for Melody Maker, Brian Harrigan opined that Dark Horse [...] "should certainly do a tremendous amount to salvage George's battered reputation" [...] but found the extended playout to [...] "Far East Man" [...] overlong – an example, he said, where [...] "you can have just too much of a good thing".|$|E
2500|$|An initial {{candidate}} troupe was {{the existing}} BBC TV Beat Girls, but an ex-dancer from the Beat Girls, Jo Cook, was eventually engaged {{to create a}} troupe, the all-female Go-Jos., with Cook as choreographer. The Go-Jos also worked outside of Top of the Pops, notably for two years on the Val Doonican show – Doonican said in 1968 [...] "I thought the Gojos were fabulous, something really new. When I <b>got</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> television series I just had to have them with me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1973 Wood {{asked his}} old friend Mick Taylor, who he had known since the early 60s, to help out with his first solo album. In December 1973, Wood collaborated with Mick Jagger on the song [...] "It's Only Rock'n Roll (But I Like It)". Eventually, Jagger and Keith Richards also contributed to Wood's solo LP. I've <b>Got</b> <b>My</b> <b>Own</b> Album to Do, was {{released}} in 1974 and recorded at Wood's private studio {{in the basement of}} his home in London, The Wick.|$|E

60|$|Sir Leicester Dedlock coughed as if {{he could}} not {{possibly}} hear another word in reference to such an individual and took his leave with great ceremony and politeness.

2500|$|Then, I <b>got</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> radio show, which I just {{mentioned}} was fifteen minutes, five nights a week, which Frank Sinatra followed, {{and we knew}} each other pretty well.

2500|$|In the 1970s Richards worked {{outside the}} Rolling Stones with Ronnie Wood on several occasions, {{contributing}} guitar, piano and vocals to Wood's first two solo albums and joining him on stage for two July 1974 concerts to promote I've <b>Got</b> <b>My</b> <b>Own</b> Album to Do. In December 1974 Richards {{also made a}} guest appearance at a Faces concert. During 1976 and '77, Richards played on and co-produced John Phillips's solo recording Pay Pack & Follow (released in 2001). In 1979 he toured the US with the New Barbarians, the band that Wood put together to promote his album Gimme Some Neck; he and Wood also contributed guitar and backing vocals to [...] "Truly" [...] on Ian McLagan's 1979 album Troublemaker (re-released in 2005 as Here Comes Trouble).|$|E

40|$|After I {{finished}} my blog project Bilateral Kellerberrin in WA (April-May 2005) I had an epiphany.

I've even <b>got</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> TARDIS!" [...] In 2006, readers of Doctor Who Magazine voted Tennant [...] "Best Doctor" [...] over perennial favourite Tom Baker. In 2007, Tennant's Doctor was voted the [...] "coolest character on UK television" [...] in a Radio Times survey[...] Writer Russell T Davies made the decision not to use Tennant's own Scottish accent for the character as he did not want the Doctor's accent [...] "touring the regions", using Estuary English instead. Tennant has gone on record as saying that, contrary to tabloids reports, he was not upset at not being able to play the role in his own accent and in fact had never wanted to. However he was pleased {{to be able to use}} his own accent in one episode, when the Doctor briefly masquerades as [...] "Dr James McCrimmon" [...] of Edinburgh in Tooth and Claw – a nod to the Second Doctor's companion Jamie McCrimmon.|$|E
