For example, shade-grown coffee plantations typically have lower tree diversity than unmanaged forests, however they have much higher tree species diversity and richness than other agricultural methods. Agriculture that mimics nature, encourages natural forest species along with the crops, and also takes pressure off nearby uncultivated forest areas where people are allowed to collect forest products. [...] The understory can also be managed with reconciliation ecology: allowing weeds to grow among crops (minimizing labor and preventing the invasion of noxious weed species) and leaving fallowlands alongside farmed areas can enhance understory plant richness with associated benefits for native insects and birds compared to other agricultural practices.|$|E
40|$|While some {{environmental}} historians {{have used the}} insights {{of the natural sciences}} in their historical work, Emily Russell, offering a scientist 2 ̆ 7 s perspective, challenges ecologists to incorporate historians 2 ̆ 7 methods and insights into their studies. In People and the Land through Time, Russell outlines working principles for the 2 ̆ 2 historical ecologist, 2 ̆ 2 a scholar who traces past human impacts on particular ecosystems. She makes it clear that her emphasis is on ecological systems rather than humans, but argues that ecosystems can 2 ̆ 7 t be fully understood without accounting for how human actions have affected them. The book provides an introduction to methods and a variety of case studies showing historical <b>ecology</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Part I, 2 ̆ 2 Questions and Clues, 2 ̆ 2 explains why human history is relevant in ecological studies and introduces the types of historical sources ecologists ought to use. Historians would find the source discussion pretty obvious, but Russell does offer an engrossing analysis of varieties of information and how they might be flawed. Any student or scholar without prior exposure to historical method would find this section useful. Toward the end of Part I, Russell begins connecting documentary and field evidence to show how the two work together to give a more complete picture of an ecosystem. Non-ecologists can learn from this section because Russell describes important scientific methods, such as pollen analysis...|$|E
40|$|In the 25 {{years since}} Ellis, Gibbs, and Rein {{proposed}} the time-space taxonomy, {{research in the}} ‘same time, same place’ quadrant has diversified, perhaps even fragmented. This one-day workshop will bring together researchers with diverse, yet convergent interests in tabletop, surface, mobile, and wearable technologies, spaces and spatial interaction, and those interested in the social aspects of interaction, such as conversation analysis and ethnomethodology. These communities have matured considerably, and produced significant exemplars of systems, methods, and studies concerned with collocated interactions. Yet, new challenges abound as people wear and carry more devices than ever, creating fragmented device <b>ecologies</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> and changing the ways we socialise with each other. In this workshop we seek to start a dialogue to look back as well as forward, review best practices, discuss and design paper-prototypes using the collocated design framework, to consider how we might address new and future challenges through collocated design practice...|$|R

40|$|Arakawa and Madeline Gins&# 039; book, The Architectural Body, both {{forwards}} and {{performs a}} radical relation of indiscernibility between the embodied {{performance of the}} inhabitant and their architectural or built surrounds. This paper will explore the conceptual and architectural composition of the architectural body and suggest, after Gilles Deleuze and Benedict de Spinoza, {{that we do not}} yet know what this (architectural) body can do! In particular I will focus on the dialogue that Arakawa and Gins employ in The Architectural Body to demonstrate how the performing body-being and the transforming architectural surround cleave to one another to create another kind of atmospheric individual, a bioscleave, that is, a resituated concept of ecology. To explore the atmospheric <b>ecologies</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in the concept of the architectural body and/or the bioscleve, I will place two further conceptual scenes alongside that offered in Arakawa and Gins book: The first scene is another dialogue, Metalogue: Why do Things have outlines? from Gregory Bateson&# 039;s Steps to an Ecology of Mind, and the second scene is that in which Deleuze describes the active procedure of the diagram where he writes Francis Bacon: The Logic of Sensation. The aim of drawing these three scenes together is to investigate what unfolds at the threshold between the exfoliating body and the architectural surround, what happens when they approach, embrace and withdraw again...|$|R
