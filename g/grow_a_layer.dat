After oxalic acid etching, we transfer the hole pattern from the AAO layer to the SiO 2 layer by reactive ion etching. Lastly, we utilize metal-organic chemical vapor deposition to grow GaN nanorods approximately 1. 5 μm in size. We then grow two layers of InGaN/GaN double quantum wells on the semi-polar face of the GaN nanorod substrate under different temperatures. We then study the characteristics of the InGaN/GaN quantum wells formed on the semi-polar faces of GaN nanorods. We report the following findings from our study: first, using SiO 2 with repeating hole pattern, we are able to grow high-quality GaN nanorods with diameters of approximately 80 - 120 nm; second, photoluminescence (PL) measurements enable us to identify Fabry-Perot effect from InGaN/GaN quantum wells on the semi-polar face. We calculate the quantum wells' cavity thickness with obtained PL measurements. Lastly, high resolution TEM images allow us to study the lattice structure characteristics of InGaN/GaN quantum wells on GaN nanorod and identify the existence of threading dislocations in the lattice structure that affects the GaN nanorod's growth mechanism.

5000|$|After his studies, Atalla was {{employed}} at Bell Laboratories. He researched among other things, {{the use of}} silica as <b>a</b> protective <b>layer</b> of silicon semiconductor devices. By adopting <b>a</b> method of <b>growing</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> of silicon dioxide {{on top of a}} silicon wafer, Atalla was able to overcome the surface states that prevented electricity from reaching the semiconducting layer. This is known as surface passivation, a critical step that made possible the ubiquity of silicon integrated circuits. Atalla then suggested that a field effect transistor - first envisioned in the 1920s and confirmed experimentally in the 1940s but not yet achieved -- be built of metal-oxide-silicon. Atalla assigned the task to Dawon Kahng, a scientist in his group. Attalla and Kahng announced their successful MOSFET at a 1960 conference. [...] Their research {{led to the development of}} the first metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET). The MOSFET has evolved since the central component of today's integrated circuits such as microprocessors and semiconductor memory.

40|$|Silicon Carbide (SiC) has the {{potential}} to signiﬁcantly improve electronics. As a material, it can conduct heat better, carry larger currents and can give faster responses compared to today’s technologies. One way to produce SiC for use in electronics is by <b>growing</b> <b>a</b> thin <b>layer</b> in <b>a</b> CVD-reactor (chemical vapour deposition). A CVD-reactor leads a carrier gas with small parts of active gas into a heated chamber (susceptor). The gas is then rapidly heated to high temperatures and chemical reactions occur. These new chemical substances can then deposit on the substrate surface and <b>grow</b> <b>a</b> SiC <b>layer.</b> This thesis investigates the eﬀect of diﬀerent opening angles on a susceptor inlet in a SiC horizontal hot-walled CVD-reactor at Linköping University. The susceptor inlet aﬀects both the ﬂow and heat transfer and therefore has an impact on the conditions over the substrate. A fast temperature rise in the gas as close to the substrate as possible is desired. Even temperaturegradients vertically over the substrate and laminar ﬂow is desired. The CVD-reactor is modeled with conjugate heat transfer using CFD simulations for three diﬀerent angles of the inlet. The results show that the opening angle mainly aﬀects the temperature gradient over the substrate and that a wider opening angle will cause a greater gradient. The opening angle will have little eﬀect on the temperature of the satellite and substrate...|$|R
