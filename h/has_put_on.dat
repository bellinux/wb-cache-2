Moss tells Aaronow {{that they need}} to strike back by stealing all the Glengarry leads and selling them to another real estate agency. Moss's plan would require Aaronow to break into the office, stage a burglary, and steal all the prime leads. Aaronow wants no part of the plan, but Moss intimidates him, claiming that he is already an accomplice simply by listening to Moss's pitch.|$|E

25|$|On 15 March 2010, Genesis was {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Hackett making a rare appearance alongside Collins, Banks and Rutherford at the ceremony, though they did not perform together. Hackett, in recent years, <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> record his willingness to participate in a reunion. A planned reunion of the classic 1970s Genesis line-up fell apart in 2007 when Peter Gabriel expressed reservations, and subsequently Hackett dropped out in deference to the Genesis 'trio' line-up, as opposed to the four-piece. With Phil Collins's announcement of his retirement in 2011, any possibility of another reunion is very slim.|$|E

In recent years the TCDS has produced four shows per season, including a spring musical, selected by the College-elected TCDS committee.

While most productions {{are now in the}} GIT, plays have also been staged in other rooms at Trinity and outside in the quadrangle, most notably the annual Shakespeare in the Quad production - a continuation of the oldest outdoor Shakespeare festival in Canada.|$|E

In that innings in Newlands, he reached a national record partnership of 368 with Graeme Smith. He <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a further two 300-run opening stands with his captain, making them the only pair in Test history to break 300 on three occasions. He also holds the South African second wicket record, a partnership of 315* with Jacques Kallis.|$|E

25|$|His wife Mary has {{recently}} returned from treatment for drug addiction and <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> weight as a result. She is looking much healthier than the family has been accustomed to, and they remark frequently on her improved appearance. However, she still retains the haggard facial features of a long-time addict. As a recovering addict, she is restless and anxious. She also suffers from insomnia, which is not made any easier by her husband and children's loud snoring. When Edmund, her younger son, hears her moving around at night and entering the spare bedroom, he becomes alarmed, {{because this is the}} room where, in the past, she would satisfy her morphine addiction. He questions her about it indirectly. She reassures him that she just went there to get away from her husband's snoring.|$|E
25|$|Other revues at the {{university}} are held from time to time: students from New College, the Faculty of the Built Environment and {{the university}}'s Buddhist club organise smaller-scale shows. Sketch comedy shows have also been hosted by the New South Wales University Theatrical Society (NUTS), the UNSW comedy club Studio Four, and other groups. A medical-student-only production called UNSW Medshow (or sometimes Med Show) was established in 2000 by former Med Revuer Neil Jeyasingam after he failed to be elected Med Revue director, Med Show has been held annually since. The Australian Graduate School of Management (AGSM), {{which is part of}} the university, <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> revues in the past (notably 1997 and 1998).

500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's {{studies and}} his change in {{attitude}} regarding music education brought him the scorn of his fellow nationalists, {{who thought he was}} throwing away his Russian heritage to compose fugues and sonatas. After he strove [...] "to crowd in as much counterpoint as possible" [...] into his Third Symphony, he wrote chamber works adhering strictly to classical models, including a string sextet, a string quartet in F minor and a quintet for flute, clarinet, horn, bassoon and piano. About the quartet and the symphony, Tchaikovsky wrote to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, that they [...] "were filled with a host of clever things but... imbued with a dryly pedantic character". Borodin commented that when he heard the symphony, he kept [...] "feeling that this is the work of a German Herr Professor who <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> his glasses and is about to write Eine grosse Symphonie in C".|$|E

James wrote that the [...] "announcing team was perfect tonight, no bickering, no fake feuds, no 'storytelling' for things outside the ring", especially [...] "in the opening match, where it was clear that they were completely invested in the match". He also wrote that Cesaro-Zayn was [...] "match of the year by a country mile", describing it as [...] "better, more emotionally intense, and more exciting than anything WWE <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> since their previous encounter". [...] "Some of the sequences in here had 5+ counters strung together" [...] and there was [...] "hard hitting action".|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century WNO gave more than 120 {{performances}} a year, with a repertoire, generally, of eight full-scale operas. Its regular audience figures totalled over 150,000 annually, in ten principal venues, three of them in Wales and seven in England. During this period the company was criticised for being insufficiently Welsh. A local politician, Adam Price, said that WNO ought to have a Welsh musical director; Alun Hoddinott said in 2004, [...] "WNO <b>has</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> perhaps four or five Welsh operas over 20 years. ... They just seem to have an anti-Welsh music bias. I am sad that they do not do something for Welsh composers, especially young ones." [...] A more positive view of WNO came from Scotland, where the two main newspapers, The Scotsman and The Herald, greeted a visit from the company in 2005 with enthusiastic praise, contrasting the flourishing of opera in Wales with its neglect by politicians in Scotland and the consequent decline of Scottish Opera. In 2010 WNO commissioned Gair ar Gnawd ("Word on Flesh"), by Pwyll ap Siôn and Menna Elfyn, with words in Welsh, described as [...] "a contemporary story about Wales today ... inspired by the translation of the Bible".|$|E
