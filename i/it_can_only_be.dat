5|$|Peter I Island {{is one of}} Norway's two {{territorial}} {{claims in}} Antarctica, the other being Queen Maud Land. Peter I Island is the only claim within 90°W and 150°W and is also the only claim {{which is not a}} sector. Being south of 60°S, the island is subject to the Antarctic Treaty. The treaty ensures free access to the island for any scientific investigation, and states that <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> used for peaceful purposes. Norway, Australia, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have all mutually recognized each other's claims in Antarctica.|$|E

5|$|The {{hardness}} of diamond {{contributes to}} its suitability as a gemstone. Because <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> scratched by other diamonds, it maintains its polish extremely well. Unlike many other gems, it is well-suited to daily wear {{because of its}} resistance to scratching—perhaps contributing to its popularity as the preferred gem in engagement or wedding rings, which are often worn every day.|$|E

5|$|At the Penitentiary, Quinn {{releases}} Poison Ivy {{from her}} cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production {{facility in the}} Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc {{before returning to the}} Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment.|$|E
5|$|However, an {{analysis}} in 2009 using both morphological and molecular phylogenetics comparisons concluded the molluscs are not monophyletic; in particular, Scaphopoda and Bivalvia are both separate, monophyletic lineages {{unrelated to the}} remaining molluscan classes; the traditional phylum Mollusca is polyphyletic, and <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> made monophyletic if scaphopods and bivalves are excluded. A 2010 analysis recovered the traditional conchiferan and aculiferan groups, and showed molluscs were monophyletic, demonstrating that available data for solenogastres was contaminated. Current molecular data are insufficient to constrain the molluscan phylogeny, and since the methods {{used to determine the}} confidence in clades are prone to overestimation, it is risky to place too much emphasis even on the areas of which different studies agree. Rather than eliminating unlikely relationships, the latest studies add new permutations of internal molluscan relationships, even bringing the conchiferan hypothesis into question.|$|E
5|$|Mendelevium is a {{synthetic}} element with chemical symbol Md (formerly Mv) and atomic number 101. A metallic radioactive transuranic {{element in the}} actinide series, {{it is the first}} element that currently cannot be produced in macroscopic quantities through neutron bombardment of lighter elements. It is the third-to-last actinide and the ninth transuranic element. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. A total of sixteen mendelevium isotopes are known, the most stable being 258Md with a half-life of 51days; nevertheless, the shorter-lived 256Md (half-life 1.17hours) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.|$|E

5|$|The event {{opened with}} a Shop of Horrors match between Abyss and Black Reign, which lasted 10 minutes and 13 seconds. In a Shop of Horrors match, all weapons are legal to use, a wrestler can not be counted out, and <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> won by pinfall or submission. James Mitchell {{interfered}} on Reign's behalf during the encounter. Abyss won the contest by pinfall after slamming Reign into the mat with his maneuver, the Black Hole Slam. After the encounter, Abyss grabbed a key that hung around Reign's neck {{and used it to}} open a locked building on the stage, which unknowingly was occupied by an unknown wrestler. Reign and the unknown wrestler then proceeded to lock Abyss in the building and push it off the stage.|$|E
5|$|Sky Team (Místico, Valiente and Volador Jr.) are {{the current}} champions, having {{defeated}} Los Guerreros Laguneros (Euforia, Niebla Roja and Último Guerrero) {{to win the}} title on February 13, 2015. They are the 27th overall championship team and this is their first reign as a team. Místico and Valiente have previously held the championship with Máscara Dorada. 25 different teams have held the title, combining for 27 individual title reigns. Only two teams have held the title more than once, the first champions Los Infernales and the team of Héctor Garza, Hijo del Fantasma and La Máscara. Black Warrior, Blue Panther and Dr. Wagner Jr. hold {{the record for the}} longest single reign of any team, but due to the uncertainty of when the championship was vacated <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> verified that they held them for a minimum of 1,141 days. Dr. Wagner Jr.'s four reigns combine to 2,051 days, the highest of any wrestler. Héctor Garza's five individual reigns is the record for the most reigns of any individual wrestler. All title matches take place under two out of three falls rules.|$|E
5|$|To be {{considered}} for title, a person must perform a deed that greatly benefits the state and Belarusian society at large. The title can be awarded to those serving in the military, public service or private enterprise. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> awarded once to an individual, and can be awarded posthumously. The official criteria are stated in Chapter 2, Article 5 of Law N 288-З. Chapter 3, Article 60 of Law N 288-З allows any group (association) of workers to submit a recommendation (petition) for an individual to be awarded the title. Governmental bodies, the National Assembly, the Council of Ministers, cabinet officials and public unions, among others, are also eligible to submit nominations for the title. The candidate is evaluated, and if deemed worthy, the nomination is forwarded to the Council of Ministers and then, after having been allowed by the Governmental Secretariat of the Belarusian Security Council, to the President of the Republic.|$|E
