40|$|A non-isolated high-step-up {{resonant}} DC/DC converter {{made up of}} a resonant inverter and {{a passive}} switchedcapacitor (SC) rectifier, is proposed in this paper. The proposed converter is free of transformer and coupled-inductor. Thus, issues related to the leakage inductance and the large volume magnetic component caused by large turn’s ratio of high-voltagegain applications, are avoided. Besides, as the converter contains only one active switch, its control is simple. Second harmonic voltage across the switch is attenuated to provide low voltage stress for the active switch and a higher voltage gain of the converter. The voltage gain of the converter is not achieved by a single stage, but by the <b>gain</b> <b>product</b> of the resonant inverter and SC rectifier. A prototype with input voltage 6 V, 500 kHz switching frequency, 50 % duty cycle, is constructed to validate the performance of the proposed converter.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the amplifiers (TMA) design and performance serve to lower the of an EPHEMT low noise system noise figure (NF) amplifier MMIC and its in cellular base-stations. evaluation circuit For performance reasons, the TMA is located as near to the receiving aerial as practical {{and has to be}} connected {{to the rest of the}} radio at the tower’s base by a long run of coaxial cable. The parameters critical to TMA performance are low NF for reasons of optimizing coverage area, high gain to overcome the cable loss, and high linearity as the TMA must operate reliably in a crowded RF spectrum. Additionally, the TMA is required to present a nonreflective input and output terminations, that is, a return loss (RL) of – 20 dB, and yet exhibits sub- 1 dB NF. LNA designs for TMA service typically rely on the hybrid-coupled balanced amplifier arrangement to satisfy this challenging combination of noise and RL requirements [1]. Unfortunately, the balanced amplifier approach increases the cost, size and power consumption of the LNA. The MMIC device described henceforth (Avago Technologies MGA- 632 P 8) represents an important milestone for cellular TMA designs as it simultaneously achieves both target RL and NF without relying on costly and spacehogging hybrid couplers (also known as quadrature hybrids). A means for varying the gain is provided to fulfill customers ’ requirement for gain leveling between adjacent bands, e. g., at PCS and WCDMA. Device and Packaging Design The semiconductor technology that forms the basis of this MMIC is EPHEMT structures on a GaAs wafer; a combination that enables the lowest noise figure of all RF technologies at a reasonable cost [2].

40|$|Media {{promotion}} of the ideal body as slimness for women and muscularity for men, has led to increasing numbers of both genders reporting dissatisfaction with their bodies and trying to change using weight control products. It {{has been suggested that}} pharmacists can {{play a key role in}} promoting healthy lifestyles and weight management. The main aim of the research study was to examine the impact of media on body image perception and to investigate the role of pharmacists in weight management. This thesis consists of three studies: an evaluation of weight control websites, a body image survey of young adults and interviews with pharmacists. The results from the evaluation study showed that the quality of most weight loss (64 %) and weight <b>gain</b> <b>product</b> advertisements (80 %) was generally poor, principally due to the use of misleading claims and a lack of useful information. These data complement the survey that university students reported rarely being influenced by weight control product adverts and hardly considered using these products as a method for changing weight. The survey also showed that most participants of both genders (71 %) felt satisfied with their body image. However, the findings in this study indicated that there was a relationship between a high level of body image concern and self-perception of being overweight and the attempt to lose weight. Interviews with pharmacists showed that they were unlikely to be actively involved in reducing obesity problems and promoting healthy lifestyles in the community. Although the prevalence of body dissatisfaction and the use of weight control products among these young adults may not be as high as has been reported elsewhere, healthcare professionals, including pharmacists, need to be aware of this problem when providing advice or consultations for young adults. Healthcare professionals should promote the benefits of healthy lifestyles as well as providing information about potential problems of harmful weight control strategies. The effect of ethnicity and culture on body image concern warrants further. The availability of weight control products and quality of information provided should also be further examined.

40|$|The Digital Beamforming Synthetic Aperture Radar (DBSAR) is an eight-channel {{phased array}} radar system that employs {{solid-state}} radar transceivers, a microstrip patch antenna, and a reconfigurable waveform generator and processor unit. The original DBSAR transceiver design utilizes connectorized electronic components {{that tend to}} be physically large and heavy. To achieve increased functionality in a smaller volume, PCB (printed circuit board) transceivers were designed to replace the large connectorized transceivers. One {{of the most challenging}} problems designing the transceivers in a PCB format was achieving proper performance in the calibration path. For a radar loop-back calibration path, a portion of the transmit signal is coupled out of the antenna feed and fed back into the receiver. This is achieved using passive components for stability and repeatability. Some signal also leaks through the receive path. As these two signal paths are correlated via an unpredictable phase, the leakage through the receive path during transmit must be 30 dB below the calibration path. For DBSAR s design, this requirement called for a 100 -dB isolation in the receiver path during transmit. A total of 16 solid-state L-band transceivers on a PCB format were designed. The transceivers include frequency conversion stages, T/R switching, and a calibration path capable of measuring the transmit power-receiver <b>gain</b> <b>product</b> during transmit for pulse-by-pulse calibration or matched filtering. In particular, this calibration path achieves 100 -dB isolation between the transmitted signal and the low-noise amplifier {{through the use of a}} switching network and a section of physical walls achieving attenuation of radiated leakage. The transceivers were designed in microstrip PCBs with lumped elements and individually packaged components for compactness. Each transceiver was designed on a single PCB with a custom enclosure providing interior walls and compartments to isolate transceiver subsystems from radiated interference. The enclosure also acts as a heat sink for the voltage regulators and power amplifiers inside the system. The PCB transceiver design produces transmit pulses of 2 W with an arbitrary duty cycle. Each transceiver is fed by an external 120 -MHz signal transmit and two 1, 140 -MHz local oscillator signals. The received signal is amplified and down-converted to 120 MHz and is fed to the data processor. The transceiver dimensions are approximately 3. 5 11. 5 0. 6 in. (9 29 1. 5 cm). The PCB transceiver design reduces the volume and weight of the DBSAR instrument while maintaining the functionality found in the original design.

40|$|A {{capacitive}} micromachined {{ultrasonic transducer}} (cMUT) is typically fabricated by concatenation of several cMUT cells with identical physical dimensions. If the membrane thickness is kept fixed, the radius of the cMUT determines the center frequency of operation. A smaller radius implies a greater center frequency. Therefore, {{it should be possible}} to put cMUTs with different sizes in parallel to get a larger bandwidth at the expense of gain. In this study, we investigate the optimization of the bandwidth characteristics of a cMUT by using mixed size cells. We designed two mixed size cMUT arrays with a predicted optimized fractional bandwidth value of about 155 % at 5. 4 MHz, and 146 % at 8. 8 MHz. These values are about 55 % and 58 % better than what can be achieved with a uniform size array at the corresponding center frequencies.
