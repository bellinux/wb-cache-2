5|$|Negroes are not {{barred from}} {{organized}} baseball by the commissioner {{and never have}} been in the 21years I have served. There is no rule in organized baseball prohibiting their participation and never has been to my knowledge. If Durocher, or if any other manager, or all of them, want to sign one, or twenty-five Negro players, it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> with me. That is the business of the managers and the club owners. The business of the commissioner is to interpret the rules of baseball, and to enforce them.|$|E
5|$|With Homer and Lisa re-united, {{he tells}} her that it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> to take risks in life. The two decide {{to go to the}} museum after all, by {{illegally}} entering since it is now closed. While there, they make a fascinating discovery that the Orb of Isis is a music box which had gone overlooked by scientists and museum staff. Lisa concludes that what her father said about risks was right– until the alarm goes off and guard dogs chase them out of the building.|$|E
5|$|Clark, Chloe, and Pete {{arrive at}} the dance, and say their goodbyes to Whitney before he leaves for training. The weather begins to deteriorate, and a storm picks up, as Lana takes Whitney to the bus stop. Jonathan (John Schneider) and Martha (Annette O'Toole) decide {{to head to the}} storm cellar to seek cover from the storm, and they {{discover}} Nixon just as the octagonal disk activates the ship. Nixon attempts to escape with the videotape, and Jonathan chases out into the storm after him. The ship levitates off the ground and flies out of the storm cellar. Lana says goodbye to Whitney and drives home. On her way, storm winds force her off the road, right next to three tornadoes that have touched down. The students at the dance are alerted to the tornados that have been sighted, and Clark races off to make sure Lana <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> The three tornadoes merge into one large tornado and move in Lana's direction. Clark arrives just as Lana, in the truck, is sucked into the tornado's vortex; Clark speeds into the tornado to rescue her.|$|E

5|$|One morning Josh {{witnesses}} Arthur Shaw, {{a wealthy}} Tower resident, being kidnapped. Josh gives chase, but is tackled by FBI agent Claire Denham, who explains that Shaw {{was attempting to}} flee the country and avoid arrest for embezzling $2 billion in a Ponzi scheme. Josh confesses to the Tower staff that he gave their pensions to Shaw to invest, and they have lost everything; Lester attempts suicide by stepping {{in front of a}} train, but survives. After visiting Lester in the hospital, Josh, Charlie, and Enrique confront Shaw, under house arrest in his penthouse apartment. Shaw expresses condolences, but is not sincere enough when he forgets to ask if Lester <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> and out of anger, Josh smashes the windows of the 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso displayed in Shaw's apartment. Josh's boss, Mr. Simon, fires him for his actions, as well as Charlie and Enrique.|$|E

25|$|There {{was much}} comment in the Press box {{as to the}} {{legitimacy}} of this delivery but Meckiff certainly generated {{a considerable amount of}} pace. It is always difficult to assess exactly whether a bowler is throwing and it is something of which one must be sure before being too dogmatic. Once a bowler is condemned for throwing his career is finished and it is a great step to take by any umpire, especially so in a Test match...he certainly looks very much like a thrower. The umpires, however, are satisfied that he <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> and they are the judges.|$|E
25|$|Of course, we may {{expect to}} hear more about this part of the question; but even supposing Sir Morton Peto's apology to be true in point of fact, what a pitiful apology it is! He, an {{experienced}} man of business, and the regular financial adviser to the company, disclaims all responsibility for unjustifiable financial actions, if only the company's solicitors tell hint that it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> Surely it is not a legal question, but a moral question, whether it is permissible to concoct fictitious documents for the purpose of evading the provisions of an Act of Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Accidents {{and lasting}} damage can {{generally}} {{be avoided by}} very simple security precautions and a rudimentary knowledge of the human anatomy. One very simple safety measure is to ask the subject every so often {{if he or she}} <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> Another is to check body parts like hands and feet for numbness or coldness, which can happen if nerves have been pinched or blood circulation has been blocked. Another is to check for skin discoloration. Skin that does not get enough oxygen turns bluish. If blood can get in, but cannot get out because one of the veins has been blocked, that part of the body turns purple.|$|E

25|$|Two years {{previous}} to {{the present}} day events, a rider arrives to the Witch's Hut from Brave, and demands to show themselves and asks for magic. The person, King Fergus, is met by a witch who asks what he wants and he says he needs something to ensure the future of his kingdom and says he will pay the price. She says he can pay her later and calls it an IOU and offers him a contract to sign and he stamps it with his signet ring. She says it’s a deal and she blends up a potion using a pluck of his hair. Later on, Fergus and Merida walking among the clans. Fergus says he’ll take the tongue of the next man who disrespects her. She sees the men writing and thinks they’re sending love notes but Fergus says they’re writing their last will and testaments. Fergus also gave Merida his prized bow that she can carry into her first battle, and Merida thanked her father for keeping her safe. Merida pulls a sword and challenges the man who knocks her down, but the person who defeated her was Mulan, who says she can teach her how to fight better than any man there and will teach her honor as well. Some of the men watching mock her and call Mulan her nursemaid, but tells her no one will follow her out of fear and says to ask her father since they already follow him. Later that day, Merida came looking for him by the water. He says the invaders are sailing in and he’s watching for them. She asks if they will win the war and then says she wants to know how he inspired all these men to follow him into battle. He looks at the helm and she asks if everything <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> Fergus says you have to show you’re the first one willing to die and says that tells them how important it is. He tells her he’s the Bear King and can face anything. She sees her father with the helm and discovers that Mulan had kept Merida from going with him. When she arrived and sees a knight coming towards Fergus, Merida aims an arrow at the knight, but misses as the knight kills Fergus. The Knight removes his helm, who is then revealed to be Arthur.|$|E

According to the official sheet music published by the Warner Music Group, the song is written in the key of D major with a moderately slow beat consisting of 125 beats per minute.

500|$|When Mulder {{returns to}} April Air Force Base, he uncovers proof that Samantha {{lived with the}} Smoking Man along with his son, Jeffrey Spender, {{and that she was}} forced to undergo painful tests. Scully finds a 1979 police report of a girl {{matching}} Samantha's description, and learns that she was taken to a hospital emergency room. She and Mulder find the nurse who treated her, and the nurse describes how Samantha disappeared the same way as Amber—without a trace. Mulder later walks through the forest and receives a vision of Samantha along with the spirits of other children. Upon telling Scully and Piller—who reacts badly upon hearing that his son is dead—of his vision, Mulder accepts that his sister is dead and in a better place. When Scully comforts Mulder and asks if he <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> he responds with a choked [...] "I'm fine. I'm free." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1967, Peng {{was taken}} to a [...] "struggle meeting", which was held in a stadium {{attended}} by 40,000 PLA soldiers. At this meeting, Peng was led in chains to a stage, where he was forced to kneel for several hours while he listened to soldiers repeatedly denouncing him for his [...] "crimes". At the end of the meeting, Lin Biao personally appeared to the soldiers, where he addressed the assembled soldiers and Peng, who was still kneeling. Lin gave a speech in which he denounced Peng as a villainous element who must be purged, and that it was [...] "in the interest of the whole Party, the whole army, and the whole people of the whole country" [...] to persecute Peng so severely. Lin then addressed Peng directly, stating: [...] "If you reform yourself, all right, if not, it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> too. But of course we hope you reform yourself." [...] It is not known whether Peng eventually broke down and [...] "confessed" [...] at the rally.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} {{scene in}} the film is a speech by Gekko to a shareholders' meeting of Teldar Paper, a company he is planning to take over. Stone uses this scene to give Gekko, and by extension, the Wall Street raiders he personifies, the chance to justify their actions, portraying himself as a liberator of the company value from the ineffective and excessively compensated executives. The inspiration for the [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech seems {{to have come from}} two sources. The first part, where Gekko complains that the company's management owns less than three percent of its stock, and that it has too many vice presidents, is taken from similar speeches and comments made by Carl Icahn about companies he was trying to take over. The defense of greed is a paraphrase of the May 18, 1986, commencement address at the UC Berkeley's School of Business Administration, delivered by arbitrageur Ivan Boesky (who himself was later convicted of insider trading charges), in which he said, [...] "Greed <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> by the way. I want you to know that. I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. SFX {{described it}} as an [...] "okay" [...] episode that was reminiscent of the earlier episode [...] "The End of the World." [...] Despite praising Pegg, the theme of [...] "media control," [...] and the Jagrafess, they criticised it for [...] " [...] to capture the imagination" [...] because there was [...] "no real palpable sense of threat" [...] and that human culture looked identical to modern day. Rupert Smith of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Anything that satirises the profession of journalism <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> with me, but this did it with style." [...] Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave [...] "The Long Game" [...] a grade of B-, describing it as [...] "entertaining" [...] and a welcome throwback to the classic series. However, he questioned the developing tradition of the Doctor not being {{the hero of the}} episode and noted that there were some dangling threads. Reviewing the episode in 2013, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was more positive, writing that it [...] "acts brilliantly as a satire of the media." [...] He also praised the guest cast and characters and Adam's departure. In 2011, Den of Geek's Mark Harrison wrote that [...] "In retrospect, 'The Long Game' is an underrated and perfectly enjoyable mid-series episode," [...] praising Adam's departure.|$|E
500|$|Details {{surrounding}} the accident are slowly revealed as the series progresses. Shortly after the crash, Michael's commanding officers (Tricia Harper and Carl Kessel) meet {{to talk about}} the accident and how they set up a [...] "short" [...] guy. Later a microphone at Ricky's Tacos speaks to Michael, claiming that if he moved to Portland he would [...] "never know the truth". Michael slowly begins to remember what happened in the accident; after realizing that Ed caused it, he speaks with Dr. Evans and Dr. Lee. His therapists insist that he is imagining it all to help cope with the pain. However, when Michael later breaks into Ed's house Ed admits that he and an accomplice were hiding heroin at the Westfield Distribution Center; [...] "they decided he had to go", after Michael began to uncover it. Michael does not know who [...] "they" [...] are, demanding that Ed tell him. Ed asks for protection before telling him, and attacks Michael when he is distracted. During the struggle Michael kills Ed, and Bird comes into the house after speaking to Dr. Evans. Michael later discovers that Carl and Tricia are involved in the setup. Tricia shoots Carl in the [...] "green reality" [...] (in an attempt to hide her involvement in the accident), but is later imprisoned. At the end of the series finale ("Turtles All the Way Down"), Michael sees Hannah and Rex together. Concerned about his odd behavior, they ask if he <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> Michael replies, [...] "I'm perfect," [...] and closes his eyes.|$|E
500|$|After a Getzein {{victory over}} the Kansas City Cowboys in 1886, the Detroit Free Press wrote: [...] "The Pretzel <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> [...] He went into the box to-day and pitched one of his finest, his curves {{circling}} around {{in the form of}} the delicious pastry from which Getz takes his sobriquet." [...] However, the editor of the Grand Rapids World opined that Getzein's [...] "curved ball" [...] was a fiction. [...] He wrote:"The baseball enthusiasts claim for Getzein that he is able to so pitch a ball that it will describe the arc of a circle on a horizontal plane before reaching the catcher, and that therein lies the secret of his marvelous pitching [...] [...] [...] [...] Scientifically, this theory is utterly absurd. The forces that act upon a ball pitched by Getzein are not different from those which operate upon a projectile thrown from any other source, and the results must be the same, and governed by the same laws. The curves are in the imagination of Getzein's admirers. When the ball leaves his hand it is beyond his control, and it moves forward from the impulse last given it as it leaves his hand. It is then controlled by the force of propulsion, the resistance of the atmosphere, and gravitation[...] [...] [...] Getzein's antic and deceptive motions may deceive the batter, so that he is unable to discover the exact course of the ball in time to strike it, but he cannot throw a ball so as to make a curve on the horizontal plane." ...|$|E
