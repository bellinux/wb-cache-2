Having only secured subscribed capital of 39% of the authorised value from the public when the line captured local imagination, it was clearly impossible to issue the preference shares now that the line was in financial trouble, and an approach was made to the Great Western Railway to take the shares. In April 1884 {{it was reported that}} Green and Burleigh were not progressing the work as fast as was hoped, and the Directors write to them, expressing their disappointment.

The School was officially opened by HRH Princess Masna on 9 March 1986, eight years after securing the lease. Funding for development was a perennial problem and had it not been for considerable support from an anonymous donor through the setting up of a trust fund under chairmanship of Mrs Meggie Leong, development would have been very much slower.|$|R

Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB) established on 1 October 1976 under the Investment Corporation of Bangladesh Ordinance 1976. It is an investment bank established to accelerate the pace of industrialization and develop a sound securities market in Bangladesh. Initially, the activities of ICB were limited to underwriting public issue of shares, bridge financing, debenture financing and opening/maintaining investors' accounts. ICB had largely expanded its areas and scope of activities and now provides various types of investment and banking services. Added activities include providing <b>debenture</b> <b>loans</b> to companies and loans to investors on margin trading basis, providing advances against ICB unit certificates, leasing of industrial equipment, managing unit fund and mutual funds, and participating in stock exchange for trading securities. Mutual fund comprising {{of a wide range}} of securities allows the participants to obtain the benefit of lower transaction costs in purchasing securities enabling the shareholders to hold more diversified portfolios. The demand for ICB mutual funds is also growing fast and persistent price rise in the market reflects the mismatch between demand and supply. In Bangladesh ICB has pioneered Mutual Funds for the sake of investors and of the capital market. ICB Mutual Funds are independent of one another. To expand its activities and give faculty to small investors ICB first introduced its mutual fund in 1980 with a paid up capital of 50 lac Taka. As this mutual fund was performing well in the capital market ICB started its other seven mutual funds gradually. From the inception till now the Mutual Funds of ICB have proved themselves as very strong and profitable sectors of investment. Their market price and NAV is high even during the bear market. From the history of dividend payment, NAV,P/E ratio, EPS, net profit we can easily understand that ICB mutual funds have a consistency in their performance. The total market capitalization of eight mutual funds is 247. 77 crore and total size of fund is 17. 75 crore. In 2014 the number of certificate holders of the eight mutual funds is 18724 which were 19799 in 2013. ICB declared record dividend on its eight mutual funds in 2013 - 2014. The highest dividend of 800 % per share was declared on the First ICB Mutual Fund. The dividend declared by the seven other mutual funds are astounding like previous years. Strong performance of the funds is reflected in the market prices of the funds. All the mutual funds are traded significantly above per value in both the bourses. All of these are on the increase every year for which investors have full confidence in these mutual funds. In 2014 the total portfolio cost of the mutual funds is 155. 81 crore where the market value of the portfolio is 401. 53 crore Taka and the distributable income per certificate is also increasing every year. As a whole the ICB mutual funds have been a valuable and attractive investment now and always. Saifur RahmanB. Business Administratio...|$|R

Object {{and methods}} of the {{dissertation}} This doctoral dissertation provides a comprehensive discussion on various equity and debt financing instruments that Finnish limited liability companies (limited by shares) generally use. The main focus of the dissertation is examining mezzanine debt instruments incorporating such things as control covenants, capital and <b>debenture</b> <b>loans,</b> perpetual hybrid loans, profit sharing loans as well as convertible and option loans. In general, mezzanine finance instruments are used as corporate finance products in Finland and are a form of hybrid capital. Albeit typically structured as debt instruments, mezzanine instruments are often more akin to equity finance instruments {{by virtue of their}} characteristics. The equity instruments are regulated mainly by company law as well as the articles of association of the company concerned, whilst the debt instruments are regulated in essence by the Law of Obligations and the general principles of contract law. The new Finnish Act on Limited Liability Companies (624 / 2006), hereinafter the "FCA", extended the contractual freedom of companies in creating different types of equity financing instruments, primarily by the creation of different classes of shares. The equity instruments may confer preferred voting, economic rights and other benefits as well as redeemable and convertible rights. Conversely, the contract law principle of freedom of contract has traditionally enabled the debt instruments to be tailored according to the needs of a particular company. Consequently, there is extensive contractual freedom in creating mezzanine debt instruments in Finland. Finnish limited liability companies issue mezzanine instruments primarily for the purposes of achieving tax benefits, improving the company´s solvency and credit ratios as well as facilitating the company´s capital funding or decreasing capital expenditure. The mezzanine instruments may, inter alia, contribute to the improvement of risk management for companies and their investors as well as increased profits for the investors. They also provide an alternative financing method for companies, their shareholders and other investors by mitigating their conflicting interests. The implementation of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in Finland has emphasized substance based evaluation in defining the difference between equity and debt in company accounts. Thus, the actual substance and nature of the instrument concerned is important more often than its legal form. However, from the perspectives of the Finnish company, accounting and tax law, the legal character and status of equity and debt instruments may differ or conflict with one another. This dissertation mainly concentrates on the analysis of various types of mezzanine instruments and the structure of the applicable Finnish legal rules. The central theme of the dissertation is the study of the principal-agent theory combined with the theory of transaction cost economics. The dissertation considers both the protection granted by the FCA as well as the risks involved for the various actors in a company. Therefore, {{the focus is on the}} factual nature and content of the financial instruments rather than their pure legal form. The analysis in the dissertation also encompasses the theory of law and economics. The Finnish legislation, legal literature and case law directly addressing debt-based mezzanine instruments are modest, and the same applies to the other Nordic legal systems. Consequently, the dissertation also contains comparative research on certain legal aspects of EU regulations and Anglo-American rules. 2. Themes, structure and conclusions of the dissertation The dissertation discusses the legal position under the FCA of a contractual creditor at a general level, and particularly the position of a debt- based mezzanine instrument holder in a Finnish limited liability company where the company is a going concern. As a general theme, the dissertation suggests that a contractual creditor of a company could, under certain circumstances, be identified as a principal of the company's management, while the board of directors in particular acts as the agent. This suggestion is highlighted especially in circumstances where the creditor is the holder of a mezzanine debt instrument conferring control or residual rights, or the instrument is perpetual by nature. A specific theme of the dissertation is the fiduciary duties of the management (the board of directors), particularly the duty of care and the duty of loyalty owed to a contractual creditor under Section 8 of Chapter 1 of the FCA. These duties have been traditionally interpreted as extending to both the company (directly) and its shareholders (indirectly). The fulfillment of the directors´ duty of care with regard to particular acts and omissions is determined by the rule of business judgment. The dissertation consists of nine Chapters. Chapter 1 describes the object, themes, theoretical frames, methods, structure and sources of the dissertation. Chapter 2 focuses on the roles of both equity-based and debt-based investors and their relevant principal-agent relations in the mezzanine financing transactions. The chapter examines, inter alia, various theories concerning a company and the shareholders or stakeholders of a company in these contexts, the regulatory frameworks and legal strategies for protecting principals, and the protection granted by the FCA for principals in various principal-agent relations. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the capital structure in a Finnish limited liability company, the characteristics of both equity and debt, equity and debt investments as a combination of risk and income, the risk preferences of various investors, the legal positions of various investors in relation to an order for distribution of payments or return of capital, and the relevance of the risk positions. In addition, the chapter discusses equity and debt capital from the perspectives of the company, accounting, tax and insolvency laws. Furthermore, Chapter 3 describes the capital structure under the FCA, including the formation, maintenance and distribution rules of the equity capital, and the creditors´ protection regime. Chapter 4 addresses mezzanine capital from the perspectives of company, accounting, tax and insolvency laws. Chapter 5 examines the levels of regulation and regulatory instruments for various types of mezzanine finance. Chapter 6 describes the different types of equity-based and debt-based mezzanine instruments used by a Finnish limited liability company and discusses various reasons for the use of the appropriate mezzanine finance instruments. Chapter 7 examines the asymmetry of legal treatment of mezzanine finance instruments from the perspectives of the company, accounting, tax and insolvency Laws, and the problems resulted from this asymmetry. The chapter also illustrates the similarities and differences between a tailored equity- based and a tailored debt- based mezzanine finance instrument, namely, a preferred share without any voting and residual income rights which is redeemable by the company, and a hybrid loan instrument having elements of perpetuity. Chapter 8 is the core of the dissertation. It provides an extensive discussion on the legal position of a contractual creditor as a principal and the legal strategies for the protection of such a creditor in general and as derived from the management´s fiduciary duties under the FCA where the debtor company is a going concern. Chapter 8 examines particularly the issue as to whether the management´s fiduciary duties (i. e., the duties of care and loyalty) under the FCA could in certain circumstances be extended to protect a contractual creditor in general and especially a debt-based mezzanine instrument holder, where the instrument has been strengthened with conditions or covenants of control rights, residual income rights or conversion rights. The chapter also discusses the relevance of the contractual loyalty principle in this context. Furthermore, Chapter 8 examines the functioning of the creditors´ protection regime pursuant to the FCA, the clarity and transparency of the legal position of the debt- based mezzanine investor under the FCA as well as the availability and reliability of information related to various finance instruments. Chapter 9 summarizes the conclusions of the research de lege lata and proposes regulative improvements de lege ferenda. The dissertation concludes with the notion that the close connection between the purpose of the company´s activities (normally long-term profit maximization of the shareholders of the company) with the going-concern principle of company law, on the one hand, and the duties of care and loyalty of the company´s management on the other, together result in the extension of the protection afforded under these fiduciary duties to contractual creditors (indirectly). This protection extends to the contractual creditors, especially when management´s decision on the distribution (and use) of company´s funds may affect the company´s liquidity and solvency, particularly in evaluating the company´s liquidity under the FCA. These fiduciary duties of management are emphasized in relation to the holders of debt- based mezzanine instruments conferring residual or control rights at that time or in the future (derived from conversion rights). The dissertation proposes de lege ferenda legislative reforms to the FCA, such as the clarification of directly and indirectly protected actors with regard to the management´s duty of care and duty of loyalty, and reevaluation of the creditors´ protection regime (and particularly the liquidity and solvency test) in distribution and maintenance of|$|R
