500|$|Help!, a {{magazine}} published by former Mad editor Harvey Kurtzman, published two stories featuring Fritz, including the character's first public appearance in January 1965, [...] "Fritz Comes on Strong". In this debut story, Fritz brings a young female cat home and strips all her clothes off before getting {{on top of}} her to pick fleas off of her.

500|$|Director Francis Lawrence said in 2008 {{that there}} would be a prequel and that Will Smith would be reprising his role. The plot of the film would reveal what {{happened}} to Neville before the infected took over New York. D. B. Weiss was hired to write the script, while Lawrence was in negotiations to return as director on the contingent that the story was interesting enough. Smith later discussed the premise, which would have his character and a team going from New York City to Washington, D.C., as they made their last stand against those infected with the virus. The film would again explore the premise of what it is like to be alone. Lawrence stated, [...] "... the tough thing <b>is,</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> we do that again and in a different way?"

This is what comes of taking to a trade you know nothing about; we have just been like two children, thinking that it was all plain and above board, and that we had nothing to do but to sell our goods and to fill up again when the hold got empty. Well, it is of no use talking over that part of the business. What we have got to do is to find out this leak and stop it.

60|$|That {{the animals}} do {{practice}} at times a rude kind {{of medicine and}} surgery upon themselves is undeniable. The only question about it <b>is,</b> <b>How</b> <b>do</b> they know? To {{say it is a}} matter of instinct is but begging the question. It is also three-fourths foolishness, for many of the things that animals do are beyond the farthest scope of instinct. The case of the deer that moved about and so saved his life, instead of sleeping on heavily to his death, may be partly a case of instinct. Personally it seems to me more a matter of experience; for a fawn under the same circumstances, unless his mother were near to keep him moving, would undoubtedly lie down and die. More than that, it seems to be largely a matter of obedience to the strongest impulse of the moment, to which all animals are accustomed or trained from their birthday. And that is not quite the same thing as instinct, unless one is disposed to go to the extreme of Berkeley's philosophy and make instinct a kind of spirit-personality that watches over animals all the time. Often the knowledge of healing or of primitive surgery seems to be the discovery or possession of a few rare individual animals, instead of being spread widecast among the species, as instincts are. This knowledge, or what-you-may-call-it, is sometimes shared, and so hints at a kind of communication among animals, of whose method we catch only fleeting glimpses and suggestions--but that will be the subject of another article. The object of this is, not to answer the questions of how or whence, but simply to suggest one or two things I have seen in the woods as the basis for further and more detailed observations.|$|E

In a study of firms in the aircraft and semiconductor industries, {{it was found that}} environmental velocity is not simply an external and objective condition to which firms react; rather, firms collectively construct their environmental velocity through their social networks, collective assumptions, and environmental scanning approaches (Nadkarni and Narayanan, 2007). Furthermore, firms should employ adaptive scanning and sensemaking approaches to effectively understand and deal with the dynamism in high-velocity environments.|$|E
