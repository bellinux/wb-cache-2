Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment.

25|$|Individual IQ {{testing is}} usually the optimal method to {{identify}} giftedness among children. However it does not distinguish well among those found to be gifted.

There is no standard consensus on which tests to use, as each test is better suited for a certain role.|$|E

25|$|Like other Neolithic societies, the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture {{had very}} little {{division}} of labor, other than the ubiquitous dualistic division based upon a person's gender. Although this culture's settlements sometimes grew to become {{some of the largest}} on earth at the time (up to 15,000 people), there is no evidence yet discovered of large-scale labor specialization. Their settlements were designed with the houses connecting with one another in long rows that circled around the center of the community. Some settlements did have a central communal building that was designated as a sanctuary or shrine, but there is no indication yet whether or not a separate <b>group</b> <b>or</b> <b>individual</b> would have been supported by the community as a full-time priest or priestess. Almost every home was a self-supporting unit, much as if isolated {{in the middle of the}} woods, rather than part of a large settlement. Most homes had their own ceramic kilns, baking ovens, and work centers, indicating that almost all of the work that needed to be done to maintain human existence at the Neolithic standard of living could be done within each household in the community.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, the Adult Manifest Anxiety Scale was introduced. It {{was made}} for three {{different}} age groups. The AMAS takes into account age-related situations that affect an individual's anxiety. The divisions include one scale for adults (AMA-A), one scale for college students (AMAS-C), {{and the other for}} the elderly population (AMAS-E). Each scale is geared towards examining situations specific to that age group. For example, the AMAS-C has items pertaining specifically to college students, such as questions about anxiety of the future. The AMAS-A is geared more toward mid-life issues, and the AMAS-E has specific anxieties the older population deals with, such as fear of aging and dying. The AMAS-A contains 36 items. It has 14 questions relating to worry/oversensitivity, 9 questions about physiological anxiety, 7 questions about social concerns/stress, and 6 questions about lies. An example of an age appropriate item for this scale is, “I am worried about my job performance”. The AMAS-C contains 49 items about the same topics, but incorporates 15 items related specifically to test anxiety. Questions relating to the items on this scale include, “I worry too much about tests and exams”. This scale is similar in structure to the CMAS discussed above. The AMAS-E contains 44 items related to worry/oversensitivity, physiological anxiety, lying, and the fear of aging. Twenty- three of the questions on the AMAS-E are related to worry/oversensitivity, but The Fear of Aging category of this scale includes items such as, “I worry about becoming senile”. Similar to the TMAS, the AMAS can be given in a <b>group</b> <b>or</b> <b>individual</b> setting, and the person responds either yes or no to each item listed according to if it pertains to themselves or not. The more items that are answered yes, suggest a higher level of anxiety. The scale has been said to be easy to complete and practical, because it takes only about 10 minutes to complete and just a couple minutes to score.|$|E
500|$|The Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award is {{presented}} by the Commissioner of Major League Baseball to a <b>group</b> <b>or</b> <b>individual</b> {{who has made a}} [...] "major impact on the sport" [...] of baseball. The award consists of a trophy: a gold baseball sitting atop a silver trophy base. The award has been presented thirteen times by Commissioner Bud Selig: eleven times to players, once to a team, and once to a non-player. The award is most often presented for breaking a Major League Baseball record; it has been presented three times to players who broke the single-season home run record (Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, and Barry Bonds). Other record-breakers to receive the award include Ichiro Suzuki (hits in a single season), Cal Ripken, Jr. (consecutive games played), Rickey Henderson (career stolen bases and career runs scored) and Mariano Rivera (career saves, both regular season and postseason; postseason ERA). The most recent recipients are Rivera in 2013 and Derek Jeter in 2014.|$|E

2500|$|The Supreme Court's {{decision}} in City of Boerne {{made a significant}} impact on the states' abilities to enforce laws, including those pertaining to historic preservation.

[...] However, in 2000, Congress enacted the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, in which it used the Spending Clause to require, for localities that receive federal funding, land use laws to accommodate religious freedom, essentially, as if RFRA had been ruled applicable to state law.|$|E
