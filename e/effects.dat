5|$|Alex Weldon {{was hired}} to be {{supervisor}} of special <b>effects</b> for the film. Weldon was planning on retiring after 42years of <b>effects</b> work, but his wife urged him to take on Star Trek because she thought {{he did not have}} enough to do. When Weldon was hired, many of the <b>effects</b> had already been started or completed by Rugg; it was up to Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted <b>effects</b> for the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, duration, and type of <b>effects.</b> Before costs could be determined and Weldon could shop for necessary items, he and {{the other members of the}} special <b>effects</b> team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the <b>effects</b> in a convincing manner.|$|E
5|$|Outcome {{is related}} to the extent and {{duration}} of lead exposure. <b>Effects</b> of lead on the physiology of the kidneys and blood are generally reversible; its <b>effects</b> on the central nervous system are not. While peripheral <b>effects</b> in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's <b>effects</b> on a child's central nervous system are irreversible. Children with lead poisoning may thus have adverse health, cognitive, and behavioral <b>effects</b> that follow them into adulthood.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{intended}} to answer the <b>effect</b> of land use, community participation {{and their relationship to}} flooding. The result states that land use has a direct <b>effect</b> to flooding with value of about - 0. 323, all of the land use does not have an indirect <b>effect,</b> therefore the total score is - 0. 323. Community participation for flood control has a direct <b>effect</b> of about 1. 640. The participation does not have an indirect <b>effect,</b> therefore the total <b>effect</b> is 1. 640. Community participation has a direct <b>effect</b> to flooding with score of - 0. 416. The indirect <b>effect</b> is 2. 322, while the total <b>effect</b> is 1. 906. Land use for flood control has no direct <b>effect</b> and indirect <b>effect.</b> Land use has a direct <b>effect</b> to flood with score of a bout - 0. 323. It does not have an indirect <b>effect,</b> while the total <b>effect</b> is - 0. 323. Flood control <b>effect</b> on flooding has a direct <b>effect</b> of 1. 416. It does not have indirect <b>effect,</b> thus the total <b>effect</b> is 1. 416. The study reveals that the land use and community participation related to flood variables have significant <b>effect.</b> Moreover, flood control effort also has significant <b>effect</b> to reduce flooding...|$|R

5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that tolerance to therapeutic <b>effects</b> develops relatively quickly while many adverse <b>effects</b> persist. Tolerance develops to hypnotic and myorelexant <b>effects</b> within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic <b>effects</b> within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines {{are unlikely to}} be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD therapeutic <b>effects</b> disappear with tolerance, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. Several studies have confirmed that long-term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep or anxiety. This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because tolerance to benzodiazepine sedating <b>effects</b> develops more quickly than does tolerance to brainstem depressant <b>effects,</b> those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired <b>effects</b> may suffer sudden respiratory depression, hypotension or death. Most patients with anxiety disorders and PTSD have symptoms that persist for at least several months, making tolerance to therapeutic <b>effects</b> a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long-term treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E

5|$|Additional {{caution is}} {{required}} in the elderly, as they are {{more sensitive to the}} pharmacological <b>effects</b> of benzodiazepines, metabolise them more slowly, and are more prone to adverse <b>effects,</b> including drowsiness, amnesia (especially anterograde amnesia), ataxia, hangover <b>effects,</b> confusion, and falls.|$|E
5|$|After the {{groundbreaking}} opticals of Star Wars, The Motion Pictures producers realized the film required similarly high-quality visuals. Douglas Trumbull, a film director with an excellent reputation in Hollywood {{who had worked}} on , was the first choice for director of special <b>effects,</b> but declined the offer. When approached, Trumbull was busy on Close Encounters, and was tired of being ignored as a director and having to churn out special <b>effects</b> for someone else's production; after completing the <b>effects</b> work, Trumbull planned on launching his own feature using a new film process. The next choice, John Dykstra, was similarly wrapped up in other projects. Post-production supervisor Paul Rabwin suggested Robert Abel's production company Robert Abel and Associates might {{be up to the}} task. The scope and size of the <b>effects</b> grew after the television movie became The Motion Picture. Abel and Associates bid $4million for doing the film's <b>effects</b> and Paramount accepted. As new <b>effects</b> were added, Abel increased their bid by $750,000, and Roddenberry suggested that the <b>effects</b> costs and schedules be reexamined.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines share {{a similar}} {{chemical}} structure, and their <b>effects</b> in humans are mainly {{produced by the}} allosteric modification of a specific kind of neurotransmitter receptor, the GABAA receptor, which increases the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels; this results in the various therapeutic <b>effects</b> as well as adverse <b>effects</b> of benzodiazepines. Other less important mechanisms of action are also known.|$|E
