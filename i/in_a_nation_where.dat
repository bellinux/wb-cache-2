Using some of the only methods left to them, this group of rural caregivers uses direct and indirect communication as a way to provide a high level of care despite the growing ‘generational gap’ between caregiver and patient, and the tendency of older Japanese patients to refrain from voluntarily communicating with caregivers. I hope to show how communication between caregivers and patients is undergoing changes that point to innovative and humanistic developments in Japanese attitudes towards elderly care...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. April 2012. Major: Educational Policy and Administration. Advisor: Dr. David W. Chapman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 210 pages, appendices A-D. Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is a post-conflict and divided nation {{in need of}} social cohesion. In order to increase trust among different ethnic groups and between civilians and public institutions, a decentralized school governance system has been introduced. This study sought to understand whether and how the internationally driven school-based management (SBM) reform in BiH functions in enhancing schools' roles of promoting social cohesion. In light of the research purpose, the study focused on school professionals' participatory democratic accountability (Kogan, 1986), and examined secondary school directors' perceptions regarding school board influence in social cohesion areas, their interactions with school boards, and their accountability to the school-based governing body. At a broader level, the study sought {{to contribute to the}} debate concerning international reform isomorphism. The study employed a mixed methods approach. A census survey with 294 secondary school directors was conducted to find general patterns in school directors' perceptions. Concurrently, interviews were conducted with 16 school directors to complement the survey findings as well as answer additional research questions. The study results show that the SBM reform was not functioning as intended. School boards, supposedly representing the interests of local stakeholders including parents, and school directors {{did not appear to be}} actively engaged in the deliberative process to promote social cohesion policies and practices. School boards influence school directors to promote social cohesion, but only in subtle and limited ways. Furthermore, school directors tended to view themselves as independent from the school boards, though, instead, their keen sense of professionalism can be utilized to facilitate local stakeholder participation. These findings indicate that a gap exists between a global reform policy and its implementation even <b>in</b> <b>a</b> post-conflict <b>nation</b> <b>where</b> the international donor community is closely involved. The study calls for donor agencies to attend to the historical, political and economic factors that might affect school-level policy implementers when they recommend educational reforms...|$|R

While the continued operation of airports {{is critical to the}} functioning of reliable air passenger and freight transportation, these infrastructure systems face a number of sources of disturbance that threaten their operational viability. Recent examples of high magnitude events include the eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajokull volcano eruption (Folattau and Schofield 2010), the failure of multiple systems at the opening of Heathrow’s Terminal 5 (Brady and Davies 2010) and the Glasgow airport 2007 terrorist attack (Crichton 2008).

40|$|To {{understand}} a particular species 2 ̆ 7 or community 2 ̆ 7 s response to forest fragments, the habitat attributes {{and the landscape}} pattern must first be quantified. However, methodology that identifies the influence of landscape pattern and local habitat structural attributes on species or community viability is poorly developed for non-human primates in fragmented forests. Successful primate conservation requires {{an understanding of how}} environmental variability at both micro- and macro-scales affects community structure and habitat use. The objective of this research was to identify landscape and local ecological characteristics that affect lemur community richness, abundance, and diversity using spatial analysis at multiple scales in Betampona Natural Reserve, Madagascar. This was accomplished through a landscape ecology perspective to document the effects of environmental heterogeneity on habitat use, behavior, and movement patterns among a community of five diurnal lemurs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> forest fragment. Vegetation structural analysis within forest patches, point-counts, and radio-collar-aided follows, in conjunction with Geographic Information Systems, were methods used to address the disconnect that has emerged involving the importance of landscape spatial pattern and primate extinction risk. The main conclusions of this research include: 1) the quantified patches demonstrate differences in micro - and macro-habitat attributes, 2) variation exists in lemur community structure and diversity indices within the patches, 3) point-count data suggest that micro- and macrohabitat features affect lemur resting, moving, and feeding behaviors, whereas radio-collar-aided follows indicate that macrohabitat has less of an effect on lemur behavior, 4) it is inappropriate to make broad generalizations based on a particular response of one population, one group, or even one individual primate to habitat alteration and extinction risk with any degree of certainty, and 5) consolidating ecological and behavioral variation into a single category such as 2 ̆ 2 fragmentation, 2 ̆ 2 undermines the ability to identify correlates of extinction risk. The development of conservation methodology and building comprehensive data sets to understand how biodiversity utilizes its environment at multiple spatial scales is vital.
