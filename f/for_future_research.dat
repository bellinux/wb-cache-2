5|$|Professor Pete Wilson, {{on behalf}} of English Heritage's Portico Properties Research Project, has {{suggested}} questions <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>research</b> and investigation of the site, including: excavation to establish its date and function; examination of historic documentation for medieval mention of use of the monument as a route or in a boundary dispute; {{and analysis of the}} site via a detailed aerial survey, lidar or other remote sensing technique to establish the extent of the monument beyond the length so far excavated.|$|E
5|$|The quarry {{is also a}} prime {{location}} for geological research and provides opportunities for field studies {{in a variety of}} disciplines: sedimentology, stratigraphy, palaeontology, geography, and industrial archaeology. Several features make this a unique {{location for}} the study of rock formations. Visitors can examine the extensively exposed rock faces, primarily Kentish Ragstone and Hassock facies, and study changes in vertical and lateral facies. The facies are glauconitic with some horizons of silicification. Shell debris (ammonites, belemnites, nautiloids, bivalves, etc.) and bioturbation are also present. The quarry could be important <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>research</b> via gamma ray profiling of the rock beds in relation to changes in sea level and climate.|$|E

25|$|Due to a {{fire that}} broke out on January 26, 1949, severe damage was caused to the building, mainly its first floor, and the murals.

30|$|Kuusi, Cuhls and Steinmüller [4] make a {{distinction}} between internal and external validity for evaluating the quality of <b>futures</b> <b>research,</b> and argue that an internally valid <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> process in turn promotes valid results, i.e., external validity of the research process. The following sections outline these sets of internal and external quality criteria <b>for</b> <b>futures</b> <b>research.</b>|$|R

25|$|Guard cells {{also provide}} an {{excellent}} model for basic studies {{on how a}} cell integrates numerous kinds of input signals to produce a response (stomatal opening or closing). These responses require coordination of numerous cell biological processes in guard cells, including signal reception, ion channel and pump regulation, membrane trafficking, transcription, cytoskeletal rearrangements and more. A challenge <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>research</b> is to assign the functions {{of some of the}} identified proteins to these diverse cell biological processes.|$|E
25|$|Higher {{levels of}} {{dopamine}} {{qualify as a}} symptom of disorders of brain function. That they are needed to sustain certain delusions was examined by a preliminary study on delusional disorder (a psychotic syndrome) instigated to clarify if schizophrenia had a dopamine psychosis. There were positive results - delusions of jealousy and persecution had different levels of dopamine metabolite HVA and homovanillyl alcohol (which may have been genetic). These can be only regarded as tentative results; the study called <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>research</b> with a larger population.|$|E

Due to widespread belief in P ≠ NP, much of this focusing of research has already taken place.|$|E

25|$|Various {{measures}} were also undertaken to encourage research. Higher spending was allocated to research, while {{the directors of}} the various research councils were changed and a series of regional colloquia set up, which culminated in a national “assises” of researchers, where some 3,000 met in Paris to establish guidelines <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>research</b> policy. A law was passed that allowed researchers in universities and agencies to sign contracts with industry. CESTA, an agency for evaluating new fields of science and technology, was established, while more money was allocate to ANVAR, the national agency for promoting the application of basic research.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the release}} of Miranda by Research Software Ltd, in 1985, {{interest}} in lazy functional languages grew. By 1987, {{more than a dozen}} non-strict, purely functional programming languages existed. Miranda was the most widely used, but it was proprietary software. At the conference on Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture (FPCA '87) in Portland, Oregon, there was a strong consensus that a committee be formed to define an open standard for such languages. The committee's purpose was to consolidate existing functional languages into a common one to serve as a basis <b>for</b> <b>future</b> <b>research</b> in functional-language design.|$|E
