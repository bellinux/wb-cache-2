5|$|Lavender Foal Syndrome (LFS), {{also called}} Coat Color Dilution Lethal (CCDL). Recessive disorder, fatal when homozygous, {{carriers}} show no signs. The condition has its name because most affected foals {{are born with}} a coat color dilution that lightens {{the tips of the}} coat hairs, or even the entire <b>hair</b> <b>shaft.</b> Foals with LFS are unable to stand at birth, often have seizures, and are usually euthanized within a few days of birth. In November 2009, Cornell University announced that a DNA test has been developed to detect carriers of LFS. Simultaneously, the University of Pretoria also announced that they had also developed a DNA test.|$|E
5|$|Most mammals have agouti hair, {{with each}} {{individual}} <b>hair</b> <b>shaft</b> having bands of colour corresponding to {{two different types}} of melanin pigment. Bears however have a single type of melanin and the hairs have a single colour throughout their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade. The coat consists of long guard hairs, which form a protective shaggy covering, and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin. The shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. Polar bears have hollow, translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the dark-coloured skin below. They have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation, and the soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur. Other than the bold black-and-white pelage of the panda, bears tend to be uniform in colour, although some species may have markings on the chest or face.|$|E
40|$|Little {{attention}} has been given to <b>hair</b> <b>shafts</b> and squamous cells in peritoneal fluid. To investigate their diagnostic value in peritoneal washing specimens, we reviewed peritoneal washing cytology preparations from 83 cases of ovarian tumors. STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed peritoneal washing specimens and histologic sections of 86 cases of ovarian tumors and tumorous conditions, including 22 teratomas, 16 serous adenocarcinomas, 10 clear cell adenocarcinomas, 9 endometrioid adenocarcinomas, 5 cases of endometriosis, 4 mucinous adenomas, 3 serous cystadenocarcinomas and 17 other tumors. RESULTS: We observed both squamous cells and <b>hair</b> <b>shafts</b> surrounded by inflammatory cells in 5 of the 22 cases of ovarian teratoma. Rupture of an ovarian teratoma was clinically and histologically found in one of the five cases. <b>Hair</b> <b>shafts</b> were not observed in the other tumors or in nonneoplastic conditions. The diameter of <b>hair</b> <b>shafts</b> in peritoneal washing specimens ranged from 10 to 28. 8 mm (average, 16. 6), and such <b>hair</b> <b>shafts</b> were present within an ovarian teratoma examined histologically. The diameter of <b>hair</b> <b>shafts</b> from six normal adults who were examined as controls ranged from 61. 5 to 118. 6 mm (average, 89. 4). CONCLUSION: <b>Hair</b> <b>shafts</b> and squamous cells surrounded by inflammatory cells in peritoneal washing specimens are a diagnostic clue to ovarian teratoma and can be observed even when rupture of the tumor is not detected clinically or microscopically...|$|R

40|$|A {{simple method}} to extract DNA from <b>hair</b> <b>shafts</b> was {{developed}} by using enzymatic laundry powder at {{the first step of}} the process. The whole extraction can be finished in less than 2 hours. The simple extraction reagent proposed here contains only two cheap components: ordinary enzymatic laundry powder and PCR buffer. After extraction, an ultra sensitive fluorescent nucleic acid stain, PicoGreen, was used for quantifying trace amount of double-stranded DNA in the solution extracted. For further validation of DNA extraction, four primers were employed to amplify DNA microsatellite loci. Both fluorescence spectroscopy and PCR results suggested that this method can extract DNA from <b>hair</b> <b>shafts</b> with good efficiency and repeatability. The study will greatly facilitate the use of <b>hair</b> <b>shafts</b> in future for DNA analyses on genome-wide scale...|$|R
25|$|At some point, the {{follicle}} {{will begin}} to grow again, softening the anchor point of the shaft initially. The hair base will break free from the root and the hair will be shed.

25|$|The {{action of}} Asip can be {{observed}} in horses which have their winter coats clipped. When shaved close, the black tip is shorn off leaving the phaeomelanic bottom of the shaft. This produces a dull, orange-gold appearance on the body coat which is lost with the spring shed. This is not usually seen in dark bays, which have little red in the <b>hair</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{straightening}} the hair often involved applying caustic substances, such as relaxers containing lye, which {{needed to be}} applied by an experienced hairstylist {{so as to avoid}} burning the scalp and ears. In the late 1890s/early 1900s, Madam C. J. Walker also popularized the use of the hot comb in the United States. Those who chose not to artificially treat their hair would often opt to style it into tight braids or cornrows. With all of these hairstyling methods, one ran the risk of damaging the <b>hair</b> <b>shaft,</b> sometimes resulting in hair loss.|$|E
40|$|Dandruff {{adherence}} to <b>hair</b> <b>shafts</b> is a visible annoying phenomenon. The aspect can be recorded by different means including the ultraviolet light-enhanced visualization (ULEV) method and microscopy. We present another quantitative method. Hairs were clipped from the parietal scalp area of 25 volunteers complaining of dandruff. They were firmly applied onto cyanoacrylate-coated microscopic slides. Hairs were lifted up after 15 - 20 s leaving a {{cast in the}} adhesive coat. Dandruff were thus harvested from the <b>hair</b> <b>shafts</b> and remained attached to the cyanoacrylate coat. After staining, the material was submitted to image analysis to derive the dandruff density per unit length of hairs.

25|$|Different {{ethnic groups}} have {{observable}} {{differences in the}} structure, density, and growth rate of hair. With regard to structure, all human hair has the same basic chemical composition in terms of keratin protein content. Franbourg et al. have found that Black hair may differ {{in the distribution of}} lipids throughout the <b>hair</b> <b>shaft.</b> Classical afro-textured hair {{has been found to be}} not as densely concentrated on the scalp as other follical types. Specifically, the average density of afro-textured hair was found to be approximately 190 hairs per square centimeter. This was significantly lower than that of Caucasian hair, which, on average, has approximately 227 hairs per square centimeter.|$|E
2500|$|Bays {{often have}} a two-toned <b>hair</b> <b>shaft,</b> which, if shaved too closely (such as when body-clipping for a horse show), may cause the horse to appear several shades lighter, a {{somewhat}} dull orange-gold, almost like a dun. However, as the hair grows out, it will darken again to the proper shade. [...] This phenomenon is part of bay color genetics, but usually not seen in darker shades of bay because there is less red in the <b>hair</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Like most insects, head lice are oviparous. Females lay {{about three}} or four eggs per day. Louse eggs are {{attached}} near the base of a host <b>hair</b> <b>shaft.</b> Egg-laying behavior is temperature dependent and likely seeks to place the egg in a location that will be conducive to proper embyro development (which is, in turn, temperature dependent). In cool climates, eggs are generally laid within 3–5mm of the scalp surface. In warm climates, and especially the tropics, eggs may be laid [...] or more down the <b>hair</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Signals {{sent out}} by the body (that only {{selectively}} affect 1 percent of all hair of one's body at any given time) determine when the anagen phase ends and the catagen phase begins. The first sign of catagen is the cessation of melanin production in the hair bulb and apoptosis of follicular melanocytes. The catagen phase, {{also known as the}} transitional phase, allows the follicle to, in a sense, renew itself. During this time, which lasts about two weeks, the hair follicle shrinks due to disintegration and the papilla detaches and [...] "rests," [...] cutting the hair strand off from its nourishing blood supply. [...] Ultimately, the follicle is 1/6 its original length, causing the <b>hair</b> <b>shaft</b> to be pushed upward. While hair is not growing during this phase, the length of the terminal fibers increase when the follicle pushes them upward.|$|E
50|$|Trichorrhexis invaginata, or bamboo hair, is a <b>hair</b> <b>shaft</b> {{abnormality}} {{that occurs}} {{as a result}} of an intermittent keratinizing defect of the hair cortex. Incomplete conversion of the sulfhydryl -SH group onto S-S disulfide bonds in the protein of the cortical fibers leads to cortical softness and subsequent invagination of the fully keratinized distal <b>hair</b> <b>shaft</b> into the softer, abnormally keratinized proximal <b>hair</b> <b>shaft.</b> Intussusception of the distal <b>hair</b> <b>shaft</b> into the proximal <b>hair</b> <b>shaft</b> results in a distinctive ball-and-socket <b>hair</b> <b>shaft</b> deformity.
