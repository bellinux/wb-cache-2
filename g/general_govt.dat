40|$|BACKGROUND Appendicitis, one of {{the most}} common causes of acute {{surgical}} abdomen, presents with a myriad of symptoms and signs resulting in a potential for delay in diagnosis or misdiagnosis. As a result, timely diagnosis is of paramount importance to avoid potential complications. However, appendicectomy based on mere clinical suspicion results in an increased incidence of negative appendicectomies. In this context, modified Alvarado score and ultrasound examination can aid in confirming suspected acute appendicitis. We conducted this study to find out the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound examination and modified Alvarado scoring system. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study of 150 patients was conducted in department of <b>General</b> Surgery, <b>Govt.</b> Medical College, Kottayam. Study involves application of modified Alvarado scoring system and performing ultrasound scan inside Kottayam Medical College Hospital in all cases. Modified Alvarado Score (MAS) is obtained by proper history taking, clinical examination and laboratory values. Following emergency appendicectomy of all cases the specimen was sent for histopathological diagnosis.

40|$|Penetrating {{injuries}} to the abdomen form an important chunk of surgical problems confronting the trauma surgeon. These injuries usually affect young healthy {{individuals in the}} society. Previously all abdominal penetrating injuries used {{to be subjected to}} laparotomy. But it was found that there were more number of negative (non - therapeutic) laparotomies if this principle is followed. Shaftan in 1960 questioned the rationale of mandatory laparotomy in al l cases of penetrating abdominal injuries, hence the laparotomy rates have fallen since then and a more selective approach is now followed depending on the clinical examination and investigations. A clinical study was conducted at <b>Govt.</b> <b>General</b> Hospital to study the modes of injury, epidemiology, evaluate the indications for emergency laparotomy in these cases and also to study the mortality and morbidity of abdominal penetrating injuries. 41 cases of penetrating injuries of abdomen were admitted in the e mergency department in a 2 year period at <b>Govt.</b> <b>General</b> Hospital. These cases after initial resuscitation were subjected to clinical examination followed by Local wound exploration, U/S of abdomen, CT scan of abdomen. The indications for immediate laparoto my were evisceration of bowel and/ or omentum, hemodynamic instability, hemoperitoneum. The remaining cases were kept under observation with serial abdominal and physical examinations and other investigations as necessary. They were taken up for laparotomy as and when necessary depending on the physical examination. Penetrating injury abdomen is most common in young males in the age group of 20 - 30 years. Abdominal stab injuries mostly homicidal are common in this parts of India. Local wound exploration unde r local anaesthesia can be used as an initial triage tool in the emergency department. But peritoneal penetration as such is a poor indicator of significant organ injury. Serial physical and abdominal examinations form an important tool which can tell the surgeon the need for laparotomy which is coupled with other investigations like U/S and CT scan. Small bowel and liver are the most common organs involved. Wound infections are the commonest postoperative complications. Mortality is zero in this study as a ll cases are due to low velocity stabs. No gun shot injuries were reported in this study hence zero mortality...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The immunobullous dermatoses are a {{group of}} {{blistering}} disorders characterised by pathogenic auto antibodies directed against the target antigens, which are components of the desmosomes or adhesion complex at the dermoepidermal junction. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) is very much valuable in the diagnosis of these lesions. AIM: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the diagnostic value of direct immunofluorescence in the commonly seen immunobullous dermatoses. The study also aimed at correlating the direct immunofluorescence patterns with cl inical and histopathological findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 patients of both sexes with suspected immunobullous disorders were selected among the patients attended over a period of one year from August, 1995 – July, 1996 in the Dermatology department of SVRR <b>Govt.</b> <b>General</b> Hospital, Tirupati, A. P. Clinical cutaneous examination along with a lesional and a perilesional skin biopsy specimens were collected from each of the 30 selected patients and were examined for histopathological study and D irect immunofluorescence study respectively at the Pathology department in the Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences (SVIMS) Tirupati, A. P. Then they were analysed by correlating the clinical, histopathological and Direct immunofluorescence findin gs of immunobullous disorders of skin. RESULTS: Out of 30, 23 cases showed DIF patterns concordant with clinical and histolpathological diagnosis. In the remaining 7 cases there was no correlation between the DIF, clinical and histopathological diagnosis, but the DIF proved to be highly valuable in confirming the diagnosis of the immunobullous dermatologic disorders. CONCLUSION: DIF is a very useful diagnostic tool in immunobullous skin disorders especially where there is overlap between clinical and histop athological diagnoses.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : The role of imaging in {{abdominal}} {{trauma is}} to rapidly and reliably determine {{the presence or}} absence of intra - abdominal injury and to triage the patients for appropriate management as trauma is a time sensitive malady. Ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) have found an increasingly important role in the evaluation of abdominal trauma. The present study was to done to compare the relative roles of ultrasound and computed tomography in t he evaluation of trauma and to effectively use these modalities in appropriate settings. METHODOLOGY : Patients presenting at the casualty department of SVRR <b>Govt.</b> <b>General</b> Hospital, following injury and suspected to have abdominal trauma were investigated. Forty three patients who were stable to undergo both US and CT examination and had at least one of these studies interpreted as positive were included in this study. US scans were performed to detect presence of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis, in add ition to assessment of individual organs. Contrast enhanced CT scans was performed. Free fluid with attenuation value > 30 Hounsfield Units (HU) was labeled as hemoperitoneum. Patients undergoing conservative management were clinically followed up. Surgical findings were noted in those undergoing laparotomy. The outcome of surgical or conservative management was correlated with US and CT findings and the overall imaging findings were analyzed for their role in guiding the therapeutic options. Sensitivity, sp ecificity, and accuracy of US and CT were calculated. RESULTS: Out of the total 43 patients, in 27 patients US and CT showed similar findings. In 40 patients US showed either intra - abdominal free fluid or organ injury or both. In three patients US did not reveal any abnormality. Two of these had retroperitoneal hematomas and one had bowel injury. These injuries were later detected on CT. US had an overall sensitivity of 93...|$|R

The youngest patient in out series was 13 years and the oldest 60 years-of age. 20. 2 % was found in teenagers indicating the present high incidence of venereal diseases in the teenagers. 665 cases seen were males and 202 were females giving a male preponderance in a ratio of 3. 3 : 1. Some clinical problems and the close resemblance of Donovanosis to Epidermoid carcinoma are considered. In 63 % of the cases the incubation period ranged between 1 - 4 weeks which can be considered the average incubation period for Donovanosis. 54. 4 % of males and 56. 5 % of females were married and the probable reasons for the greater incidence of Donovanosis in the married of both sexes are suggested. In our series 14 cases of conjugal Donovanosis were seen. Conjugal Donovanosis is not rare, but difficult to detect for lack of examination of both the sexual paterns. In our experience true spontaneous cure of Donovanosis is unknown. The shortest duration of infection was 3 days and the longest duration was 9 years. 25 cases out of 867 were extra genital forming 2. 9 %. Commonest sites were the anal and perianal regions and in the majority due to perverted sexual practices.
