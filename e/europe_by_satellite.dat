We present here the first validation results with data from two meteorological sites (Cabauw, MUREX) and output of the model run on a low resolution grid laid over Europe, for selected hours of the day. For the "on grid " validation, data to force the model was gathered from ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast) archives in order to simulate MSG derived data which in the operational phase will come from other Land-SAF products. A sensitivity analysis performed on model runs with forcing data for the site of Cabauw (NL) is also presented. 1...|$|R
