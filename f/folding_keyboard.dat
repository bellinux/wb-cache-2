50|$|The company {{sells the}} Matias <b>Folding</b> <b>Keyboard,</b> a {{full-sized}} keyboard that folds in half. One reviewer {{has found that}} the Mac version of this keyboard works with iPads (though not flawlessly) as well as with Macs, even though iPads don't officially support USB keyboards. The Matias Ergo Pro {{is one of the few}} split mechanical keyboards but what makes it unique are the standard 1/4"-20 screws mounting the palm rests making it compatible with tripods typically used for cameras.|$|E
50|$|The TrackWrite, {{also known}} as the {{butterfly}} keyboard, is a foldout laptop computer keyboard designed by John Karidis for IBM as part of the ThinkPad 701 series, released in 1995. It allowed the 701 series to be both compact (when closed) and comfortable to use (when open), despite being just 24.6 cm (9.7 in) wide with a 26.4 cm (10.4 in) VGA LCD. The 701 was the top selling laptop of 1995; however, as later laptop models featured progressively larger screens, the need for a <b>folding</b> <b>keyboard</b> was eliminated. Consequently, no model but the 701 used the butterfly keyboard.|$|E
50|$|Out of the box, {{it is used}} {{to connect}} to the sync and charge cradle, {{allowing}} the Palm to connect to a desktop PC and receive battery power. A range of accessories were also available for the Universal Connector, including <b>folding</b> <b>keyboards,</b> external battery packs, wired and wireless modems, and many more.|$|R
5000|$|TouchStream LP [...] - [...] a full-sized, <b>folding</b> split <b>keyboard,</b> {{with a flat}} {{membrane}} and zero-force keys. The entire keyboard surface has multitouch {{support that}} converts finger movements of different combinations of fingers into mouse and macro events. It comes with chording modes for graphics, Emacs, and gaming.|$|R
5000|$|Touchscreen PDAs {{intended}} for business use, {{such as the}} BlackBerry and Palm Treo, usually also offer full keyboards and scroll wheels or thumbwheels to facilitate data entry and navigation. Many touchscreen PDAs support some form of external keyboard as well. Specialized <b>folding</b> <b>keyboards,</b> which offer a full-sized keyboard but collapse into a compact size for transport, are available for many models. External keyboards may attach to the PDA directly, using a cable, or may use wireless technology such as infrared or Bluetooth to connect to the PDA. Newer PDAs, such as the HTC HD2, Apple iPhone, Apple iPod Touch, and Palm Pre, Palm Pre Plus, Palm Pixi, Palm Pixi Plus, Google Android (operating system) include more advanced forms of touchscreen that can register multiple touches simultaneously. These [...] "multi-touch" [...] displays allow for more sophisticated interfaces using various gestures entered {{with one or more}} fingers.|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{smartphones}} are {{mobile multimedia}} computers, in Nokia’s words: “It’s what computers have become”. Smartphone manufacturers {{have seen the}} potential to partner with online social software (Web 2. 0) sites (e. g. Flickr, YouTube, Vox, Ovi etc…) to produce a mobile computing platform to capture and share our daily lives with friends and family, anywhere, anytime. These tools can be utilized within tertiary education to create context independent collaborative learning environments. Pedagogical design of learning experiences using mobile web 2. 0 allows a tutor to create rich learning environments for students beyond the classroom or lecture theatre. This paper illustrates this by analysing students responses to a third year Product Design project that transformed a traditionally paper-based learning journal into an interactive, collaborative, online eportfolio using mobile web 2. 0 technologies facilitating an explicit social constructivist pedagogy. Students were provided with a Nokia N 95 smartphone, a bluetooth <b>folding</b> <b>keyboard,</b> and a 1 GB 3 G data account. They created an online eportfolio, and used the smartphones to capture and record learning events and ideas {{from a variety of}} contexts. The learning outcomes included the development of a far more media rich and critically reflective collaborative experience than was previously possible using traditional approaches...|$|E
50|$|Keyboards made of {{flexible}} silicone or polyurethane materials can roll up in a moderately tight bundle. Tightly <b>folding</b> the <b>keyboard</b> may damage the internal membrane circuits. When {{they are completely}} sealed in rubber they are water resistant. Like membrane keyboards, they are reported {{to be very hard}} to get used to, as there is little tactile feedback, and silicone will tend to attract dirt, dust, and hair.|$|R
5000|$|The Morrow Pivot II {{included}} {{one or two}} 5-1/4" [...] floppy drives. This machine was in a vertical configuration with a <b>fold</b> down <b>keyboard.</b> This was called a [...] "lunch box" [...] style unlike the typical laptop today. The only external component was a single AC adapter. It {{would have been a}} little top heavy except for the large Panasonic camcorder battery loaded into its base.|$|R
50|$|In January 2010 Jobson {{was named}} to the {{technical}} advisory board of Austin, Texas based keyboard manufacturer, Infinite Response. He was involved {{in the development of the}} company's VAX77 <b>folding</b> MIDI <b>keyboard</b> controller, which Jobson showcased at the January 2010 NAMM Show in Anaheim, California. Jobson's U-Z Project headlined NEARfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on 20 June 2010. A live CD compiled from various U-Z performances in 2009 was released as Ultimate Zero - The Best of the U-Z Project Live in Japan in November 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{selling point}} as a [...] "portable" [...] {{was that it}} {{combined}} the monitor into a base unit approximating a medium-sized suitcase that could be simply set on its flat side, plugged in, the <b>keyboard</b> <b>folded</b> down or detached, and booted up for use, though printers at the time, if needed, still tended to be less [...] "portable".|$|R
50|$|The TC1000 is a laplet {{designed}} by Compaq, {{before it was}} purchased by HP. It used the Transmeta Crusoe processor. Unlike many tablet PCs which can only operate either in traditional laptop configuration, or with the <b>keyboard</b> <b>folded</b> behind the screen, the display is fully detachable from the keyboard. The product was developed and manufactured using ODM model from LG Electronics, Inc. of South Korea.|$|R
5000|$|The NoteTaker fitted into a case {{similar in}} form {{to that of}} a {{portable}} sewing machine; the <b>keyboard</b> <b>folded</b> out from the bottom to reveal the monitor and floppy drive. The form factor was later used on the highly successful [...] "luggable" [...] computers, including the Osborne 1 and Compaq Portable. However, these later models were about half as heavy as the NoteTaker, which weighed 22 kg (48 lb).|$|R
50|$|The full line-up of Hanging Doll took form after Dan, (a {{classical}}ly trained guitarist with {{a degree}} in classical music) and Alex Cooper, who had been working together since 2002, invited Sally, a professional photographer, to take pictures of an early version of the band in 2004 (Alex, Dan, Kev and the original vocalist Emily Brownhill). After Emily quit shortly afterwards, Sally was invited to audition and recruited to fill the position. Aryan Amoli was brought into the <b>fold</b> on <b>keyboards</b> about a year later. Hanging Doll made a name for themselves in the Birmingham, West Midlands rock scene with their (official) debut album Reason & Madness. Sally Holliday’s silky, sweeping voice soars above glorious classical power metal guitar solos, haunting gothic keyboards and a massive, crunching rhythm section, effortlessly creating an irresistible British gothic rock concoction.|$|R
50|$|The band's third studio album Beneath the Veil of Winter's Face was {{released}} on May 15, 2007. Bourque died {{a few months after}} the album's release in September 2007, the cause of death was determined to be suicide. He was also a member of Emerson Drive up until a month before his death. Following the passing of Bourque, St-Père, David, and Gagné soldiered on. They hired François Fournier to replace Bourque on bass, brought second guitarist Dean Baldwin to the <b>fold,</b> and former <b>keyboard</b> player Benoît Dupuis rejoined the band in his original role.|$|R
