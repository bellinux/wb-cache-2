40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the reliability and}} throughput of the telegram-splitting concept {{in the presence of}} <b>inter-system</b> and intra-system <b>interference.</b> Using telegram splitting, the data of one telegram is split into multiple sub-packets, which are then transmitted with temporal spacing. As a result, collisions with other telegrams destroy only some sub-packets that can be recovered using forward error correction. Consequently, the reliability of the data transmission in case of inter-and intra-system interference-a significant problem in license-exempt bands-is highly improved. In this paper, probabilities for the resulting telegram error rate of random media access systems using telegram splitting are derived. Furthermore, the achievable throughput is analyzed.

40|$|The intersatellite links (ISL's) at {{geostationary}} orbit {{is currently a}} missing link in commercial satellite services. Prior {{studies have found that}} potential application of ISL's to domestic, regional, and global satellites will provide more cost-effective services than the non-ISL's systems (i. e., multiple-hop systems). In addition, ISL's can improve and expand the existing satellite services in several aspects. For example, ISL's can conserve the scarce spectrum allocated for fixed satellite services (FSS) by avoiding multiple hopping of the relay stations. ISL's can also conserve prime orbit slot by effectively expanding the geostationary arc. As a result of the coverage extension by using ISL's more users will have direct access to the satellite network, thus providing reduced signal propagation delay and improved signal quality. Given the potential benefits of ISL's system, it is of interest to determine the appropriate implementations for some potential ISL architectures. Summary of the selected ISL network architecture as supplied by NASA are listed. The projected high data rate requirements (greater than 400 Mbps) suggest that high frequency RF or optical implementations are natural approaches. Both RF and optical systems have their own merits and weaknesses which make the choice between them dependent on the specific application. Due to its relatively mature technology base, the implementation risk associated with RF (at least 32 GHz) is lower than that of the optical ISL's. However, the relatively large antenna size required by RF ISL's payload may cause real-estate problems on the host spacecraft. In addition, because of the frequency sharing (for duplex multiple channels communications) within the limited bandwidth allocated, RF ISL's are more susceptible to <b>inter-system</b> and inter-channel <b>interferences.</b> On the other hand, optical ISL's can offer interference-free transmission and compact sized payload. However, the extremely narrow beam widths (on the order of 10 micro-rad) associated with optical ISL's impose very stringent pointing, acquisition, and tracking requirements on the system. Even if the RF and optical systems are considered separately, questions still remain as to selection of RF frequency, direct versus coherent optical detection, etc. in implementing an ISL for a particular network architecture. These and other issues are studied...|$|R

It is also effective in reducing interference to the primary receiver that has no interference suppression function.

40|$|Mobile {{traffic in}} {{cellular}} networks is increasing exponentially, mainly {{due to the}} use of data intensive services like video. One way to cope with these demands is to reduce the cell-size by deploying small-cells along the coverage area of the current macro-cell system. The deployment of small-cells significantly improves indoor coverage. Nevertheless, as additional spectrum licenses are difficult and expensive to acquire it is expected that the macro and small-cells will coexist under the same spectrum. The coexistence of the two systems results in crosstier/ <b>inter-system</b> <b>interference.</b> In this context, we design several interference alignment based techniques for the downlink of heterogeneous networks, in order to cancel the interference generated from macro-cell at small-cell user terminals. More specifically, in this contribution we design interference alignment methods under different levels of inter-system coordination and the constraint that the performance of macro-cell system is kept close to the case where small-cell system is switched-off.

40|$|Abstract [...] This draft {{document}} {{is intended to}} provide spectrum regulators with {{ways to improve the}} utility of future unlicensed allocations by improving the sharing of such bands between diverse systems. The prospect of such new allocations, and the experience of <b>inter-system</b> <b>interference</b> in existing bands, motivates revisiting current FCC Part 15 rules to cope with the fact that very disparate networks will need to co-exist in these bands. Considerations & Objectives Due to the proliferation of new wireless technologies and the push to allocate new spectrum for unlicensed operation, such bands will contain disparate networks and conformal devices operating in close proximity. There are two dimensions to spectrum sharing: using the nomenclature introduced by Kruys [8], one can distinguish between “vertical ” sharing between systems with different levels of regulatory status, e. g. primary and secondary users, and “horizontal ” sharing between systems with equal regulatory status, e. g. various unlicensed networks. In the horizontal sharing case, it is also useful to distinguish between “intra-system ” sharing (between systems that are implemented usin...|$|E
40|$|In this manuscript, we {{consider}} the uplink of a single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) based system, where a set of small-cells coexist with a macro-cell using the same spectrum. To deal with both the inter-carrier interference (ICI) and <b>inter-system</b> <b>interference,</b> we combine interference alignment (IA) precoding at the small-cell transmitters with iterative decision feedback equalization at the macro-receiver. The transmitter and receiver design is performed jointly by considering both full-coordination and limited inter-system information exchange between macro- and small-cells. At the small cells side, {{we assume that the}} access points are connected through a limited capacity backhaul network to a central unit, where the separation of a quantized version of the small-cell signals is performed. For this case, the iterative feedback equalizer is designed by explicitly taking into account the impact of signal quantization. Moreover, a semi-analytical approach for the performance of the proposed schemes is provided. The results show that the proposed schemes are robust to both inter-system and inter-carrier interferences and thus are able to efficiently separate the macro- and small-cells spatial streams under limited information exchange...|$|E

Wi-Fi and LTE {{are the two most}} prominent access technologies being deployed today, motivating further study of the <b>inter-system</b> <b>interference</b> arising in such shared spectrum scenarios as well as possible techniques for enabling improved co-existence. An analytical model for evaluating the baseline performance of co-existing Wi-Fi and LTE is developed and used to obtain baseline performance measures. The results show that both Wi-Fi and LTE networks cause significant interference to each other and that the degradation is dependent on a number of factors such as power levels and physical topology. The model-based results are partially validated via experimental evaluations using USRP based SDR platforms on the ORBIT testbed. Further, inter-network coordination with logically centralized radio resource management across Wi-Fi and LTE systems is proposed as a possible solution for improved co-existence.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} thesis {{deals with}} {{the investigation of the}} coexistence of GSM–EDGE and UMTS systems with focus on the physical layer of the systems. The aim is to provide a set of recommendations for practical cooperation while the systems operate in both the separated and the common radio bands. A detailed description of signal processing of both the systems on the physical layer is presented. On the basis of this description, models of both systems were created and implemented in the MATLAB environment. The simulations are focused on the physical layer quality parameters, especially the bit error ratio evaluation for various ratios of useful signal power to noise power during the transmission over the radio channel. Simulation is also used to examine the quality of received useful signal while it is interfered by signals from the same and adjacent channels. The purpose is to determine the isolation between these adjacent channels, when the bit error ratio of the useful signal does not exceed a certain reference value. The simulation results are subsequently subjected to comparison with the results of the experimental measurements in laboratory conditions. Before the measurements are carried out, a study of possible interference types is performed. Consequently, the crucial parameters of the measuring equipment used are verified. From the results of simulations and measurements, the proposal of a minimum and recommended carrier separation between both the systems is presented in order to efficiently utilize the assigned frequency spectrum. Furthermore, for the cooperation in both the separated and the common radio bands, the necessary precautions are given for reaching the required isolation and thereby <b>inter-system</b> <b>interference</b> minimization...|$|E
40|$|Locata is a {{terrestrial}} radio-positioning/navigation {{technology that}} offers cm-level accuracies using the Carrier Point Positioning. However, it suffers from interference issues {{due to its}} operation in the license-free 2. 4 GHz band where {{a larger number of}} devices operate than in a licensed band. This results in elevation of measurement noise and consequently the degradation of positioning/navigation solution. Using real-world data this thesis first evaluates Locata performance in the presence of noise and interference. Then, in order to improve Locata performance, it proposes schemes and algorithms at the three major signal/measurement processing stages: signal acquisition, tracking and navigation; and evaluates those using real as well as simulated data. Appreciating the challenges posed by the pulsed nature of Locata signals, new signal acquisition algorithms are proposed and evaluated that offer integration gains of 1. 3 &# 150; 3 dB-Hz each time the integration period is doubled. In addition, the concept of an assisted acquisition is introduced, where acquisition of any one signal facilitates the acquisition of all other required Locata signals. To improve tracking performance, an adaptive Kalman filter based inter-loop aiding scheme is proposed that offers a 4 &# 150; 7 dB-Hz margin against noise and interference, and resists aided loop performance degradation even in situations where interference corrupts the aiding signals. Also, to improve carrier phase measurement quality, the concept of a projected-bandwidth tracking loop is introduced that offers measurement noise reductions exceeding 25 %. At the navigation-computation level, a variance estimation method is proposed where the estimation is performed considering the tracking loop outputs. It is shown that this method outperforms the widely accepted CNIR-based variance estimation when used for measurement weighting. Implementation results are presented showing solution accuracy and precision improvements of up to 36 % and 39 % compared to the conventional approach. Furthermore, it is recognised that Locata can act as a potential interferer to WiFi devices, degrading their throughput. This may not be desirable for Locata operators in particular and other WiFi operators in general. A time-share scheme is proposed and evaluated that offers improved Locata-WiFi interoperability. In addition, protective measures are proposed that aim to mitigate <b>inter-system</b> <b>interference</b> without requiring the implementation of any special algorithm...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} few years, a {{worldwide}} interest and unanimous consensus has arisen on personal communication services (PCS), where satellites can {{play a crucial role}} in a global scenario for the provision of PCS's all over the world. While for maritime and aeronautical communication services, the mature technologies of geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite systems seem the most suitable for present and future enhanced systems, other orbital configuration such as low earth orbit (LEO) and medium earth orbit (MEO) are being considered for the provision of satellite personal communication services to hand-held mobile terminals. One of the main objectives of personal communication services is the capability to provide personal (or continuous) mobility, communication anytime, anywhere. In general, satellite systems can provide a limited capacity with respect to terrestrial networks, nevertheless they are particularly suited in order to cover large terrestrial areas offering a scarce amount of traffic. The problem of radio frequency management for mobile applications has been addressed by World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC- 92). One of the most relevant decisions taken at WARC- 92 was to allocate the radio determination satellite system (RDSS) 1610 - 1626. 5 MHz (L-Band) and 2483. 5 - 2500 MHz (S-Band) slots to LEO satellite services on a worldwide, primary basis. This enables "big LEO's" to have a reasonable amount of spectram (i. e. capacity) to serve a substantial number of subscribers. However, the available amount of spectrum at L-band and S-band out of WARC- 92 appears hardly sufficient to permit several systems to operate. Hence, to enable all the systems to operate and fulfil the capacity demand, S-PCNs need to share the limited available frequency spectrum. In this thesis we have proposed and evaluated a new fully overlapped band sharing scheme for mobile satellite systems operating in a land mobile satellite channel environment. The results show that the mobile satellite systems can share the limited available bandwidth. However, the overall system capacity of the MSS has been reduced due to excess intersystem interference. In order to reduce the excess <b>inter-system</b> <b>interference</b> a new enhanced overlapped band sharing protocol is proposed. The performance of this optimised band sharing scheme outperforms the conventional band segmentation scheme. Thus, achieving superior overall system capacity...|$|E
