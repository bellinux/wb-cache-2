Overall building dimensions of 154 feet x 44 feet x 147 feet high (46m x 13m x 44m high). The building originally contained 100 flats with shops, {{a restaurant and}} offices on the ground floor. Each floor contained four one bedroom and four two bedroom flats. The ground floor restaurant [...] "The Reef" [...] (which had a nautical theme with fishing nets and other nautical paraphernalia) and later a milk bar with counter and café seating , until the early 80s was converted to a three bedroom flat in the mid-1980s. A Kiosk planned for the lobby was never operated as one and was converted for bike storage (24 bikes) in the mid-1990s. The lobby is elevated to capture the bay and park views and features cantilevered roof canopies above both entrances, clerestory windows above a curved wall of Castlemaine slate, terrazzo flooring and columns of blue and pink mosaic glass tiles. Copper mail boxes are original (Originally external, relocated inside shortly after Edgewater opened and integrated into the recycled timber screen in 2012). Many original features of the building such as the curved privacy screen before the two public restroom doors, resident directory board (black felt with white plastic letters), rockery planter with green plastic curtain/screen, open West stairwell, corridor clerestory glazing for borrowed daylight and mail chute were removed or closed off during fire life safety upgrades. The original very heavy swinging glass and timber entrance doors were replaced with aluminium framed glazing and automatic sliding doors in 2014. The original Architect's Ground Floor Plan drawing notes entrance doors as 'Aluminium Frame' though they were never installed.

40|$|Comparison {{was made}} between the {{fluorescent}} lamp and the incandescent lamp basing on qualitative experiments, and the following conclusion was reached. (1) In incandescent lamps when the reflection factor {{of the color of}} reflector is smaller, intensity of illumination will be so much the lower. The same tendency is seen with fluorescent lamps, but the effect is generally smaller as compared with incandescent lamps. Furthermore, when the color of reflector belongs to the same color group as the dominant wave-length of the light-source, intensity of illumination will be stronger. In case it is of the complementary hue or of the same color group, illumination comes out weaker. (2) When various artificial light-sources are mutually compared by the quantities of filtered radiation, it is found that the light of daylight and <b>white</b> <b>fluorescent</b> lamp resembles most closely the daylight in cloudy weather. In incandescent lamps, the zone of long wave-length is in excess, while the blue and violet zones can hardly be seen. (3) Even among the persons with normal sense of color, a high percentage of misreading and hard-reading of Stilling's Charts occurs under the illumination by an incandescent lamp, whereas under that of a <b>white</b> <b>fluorescent</b> lamp, the percentage is extremely lower. (4) As the color rendition of various light·sources are examined from the viewpoint of the "difference of color", de luxe daylight fluorescent lamp is most superior.

(1) There is a stright line relation between speed of seeing and logarithm of intensity of illumination, and the relation appears nearly same with each light-sources. (2) Speed of seeing increases as the intensity of illumination increases, and the rate of increase is great in low intensity of illumination and small in high. But the relation seems to differ slightly with the light-source and test-charts. (3) Speed of seeing varies with the luminosity-contrast, and in general, high speed of seeing is obtained in high luminosity-contrast.

40|$|A {{study of}} photoinhibition of seed {{germination}} and the induction of secondary dormancy {{has been made}} on weedy species that tend to produce large numbers of small, light-sensitive seeds. Both light-requiring (e. g., Chenopodium album) and light-inhibited (e. g., Amaranthus caudatus) species were used but nevertheless were found to show similar responses to high fluence irradiation, differences being largely ones of varying sensitivity. All species tested (except Digitalis purpurea) showed a marked inhibition of germination in continuous <b>fluorescent</b> <b>white</b> light supplemented with far-red compared to the response to <b>fluorescent</b> <b>white</b> light only. Urtica urens and A. caudatus germination, however, could be inhibited by <b>fluorescent</b> <b>white</b> light only and this response was dependent on both time and fluence rate. Interestingly, A. caudatus is a dark germinator whereas U. urens is light requiring (i. e., {{a small amount of}} light promotes germination but a large amount is inhibitory). The inhibitory action of prolonged light is dependent on photon fluence rate. In photoinhibition mediated through phytochrome cycling rate of the pigment appears to be important. However, cycling rate per se cannot explain all the observed responses; and the interuption of dark processes is another important factor. Cycling rate effects are increased when photoequilibrium is low. There is also a blue light photoreceptor of unknown form which shows fluence dependent characteristics in its photoinhibitory activity. Secondary dormancy is induced in seeds which have the ability to germinate but are prevented from doing so. In respect to the light environment, the same light conditions which inhibit germination also tend to induce secondary dormancy although there is no direct evidence on the action of blue light operating through the blue photoreceptor. The depth of secondary dormancy increases with the time of incubation in the inhibitory conditions and also is deeper for low photoequilibrium and high photon fluence rate. High photon fluence rate <b>fluorescent</b> <b>white</b> light inhibits the germination of U. urens but the high photoequilibrium established allows the seed to germinate in subsequent darkness. Photoinhibition of germination and induction of secondary dormancy have adaptive advantages for survival of the species since seedlings can avoid the competitive stresses of a stand of vegetation and the desiccating environment of the soil surface in full sunlight. Photoinhibition appears to act by preventing the active processes of germination from occurring, which thus enables the seeds to pass through cycles of hydration and dehydration without being damaged...|$|E

"nMaterials and Methods: Marine actinomycetes namely Streptomyces strain AQBMM 35 was isolated from the marine sponge Mycale mytilorum collected from South West coast of India using ISP media. The Streptomyces isolates were characterized for their colony characteristics, morphological properties, physiological and biochemical properties and were tentatively identified. Fermentation of the strain under <b>fluorescent</b> <b>white</b> light was carried out {{for the production of}} carotenoids. UV spectrum, TLC and HPLC analysis were done for the confirmation of carotenoids. "nResults: The characteristics studied strongly suggest that the strain AQBMM 35 belongs to the genus Streptomyces sp.

Growth parameters, number of shoots produced per PLB, chlorophyll concentration and carotenoid concentration were measured after 90 days culture. The percentage of PLBs producing shoots was 85 % under blue LEDs. In contrast, the percentage of PLBs producing shoots was less than 60 % under dark conditions, <b>fluorescent</b> <b>white</b> light and red LEDs. The number of shoots produced per PLB was more than 1. 5 times greater under blue LEDs, RB (1 : 1) LEDs and RB (1 : 2) LEDs than those cultured under other light treatments [dark, Fw, red LEDs and RB (2 : 1) ]. Chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations were significantly higher under blue LEDs and different red plus blue LED ratios, compared to other light treatments (dark, Fw and red LEDs). Blue LEDs, Fw, and RB (1 : 2) LEDs produced higher dry matter accumulations of PLBs and shoots.
