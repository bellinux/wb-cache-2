5|$|Another {{potential}} problem that arises at the <b>interface</b> between {{wheel and axle}} (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this <b>interface.</b> If the tissues {{that make up a}} wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with oxygen and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, {{would not be able to}} provide transportation across the <b>interface.</b> In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to diffuse across the <b>interface,</b> a process that would be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as keratin, of which hair and nails are composed.|$|E

40|$|Interactive tools make data {{analysis}} both {{more efficient and}} more accessible to a broad population. Simple <b>interfaces</b> such as Google Finance as well as complex visual exploration <b>interfaces</b> such as Tableau are effective because they are tailored to the desired user tasks. Yet, designing interactive <b>interfaces</b> requires technical expertise and domain knowledge. Experts are scarce and expensive, and therefore it is currently infeasible to provide tailored (or precise) <b>interfaces</b> for every user and every task. We envision a data-driven approach to generate tailored interactive <b>interfaces.</b> We observe that interactive <b>interfaces</b> are designed to express sets of programs; thus, samples of programs-increasingly collected by data systems-may help us build interactive <b>interfaces.</b> Based on this idea, Precision <b>Interfaces</b> is a language-agnostic system that examines an input query log, identifies how the queries structurally change, and generates interactive web <b>interfaces</b> to express these changes. The focus {{of this paper is}} on applying this idea towards logs of structured queries. Our experiments show that Precision <b>Interfaces</b> can support multiple query languages (SQL and SPARQL), derive Tableau's salient interaction components from OLAP queries, analyze < 75 k queries in < 12 minutes, and generate interaction designs that improve upon existing <b>interfaces</b> and are comparable to human-crafted <b>interfaces...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{characteristics}} of protein–protein <b>interfaces</b> using the largest datasets available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We start with a comparison of <b>interfaces</b> with protein cores and noninterface surfaces. The results show that <b>interfaces</b> differ from protein cores and non-interface surfaces in residue composition, sequence entropy, and secondary structure. Since <b>interfaces,</b> protein cores, and non-interface surfaces have different solvent accessibilities, {{it is important to}} investigate whether the observed differences are due to the differences in solvent accessibility or differences in functionality. We separate out the effect of solvent accessibility by comparing <b>interfaces</b> with a set of residues having the same solvent accessibility as the <b>interfaces.</b> This strategy reveals residue distribution propensities that are not observable by comparing <b>interfaces</b> with protein cores and noninterface surfaces. Our conclusions are that there are larger numbers of hydrophobic residues, particularly aromatic residues, in <b>interfaces,</b> and the interactions apparently favored in <b>interfaces</b> include the opposite charge pairs and hydrophobic pairs. Surprisingly, Pro-Trp pairs are over represented in <b>interfaces,</b> presumably because of favorable geometries. The analysis is repeated using three datasets having different constraints on sequence similarity and structure quality. Consistent results are obtained across these datasets. We have also investigated separately {{the characteristics of}} heteromeric <b>interfaces</b> and homomeric <b>interfaces...</b>|$|R
