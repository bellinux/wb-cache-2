40|$|Monoperoxyphthalate (MPP) was solubilized {{in three}} {{different}} aqueous cationic surfactant aggregates composed of(i) a micellar cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTACl) solution; (ii) an oil-in-water (O/W) microemulsion (ME) stabilized by CTACl, and a cosurfactant, tert-butyl alcohol, and (iii) a vesicular medium composed of dispersions of <b>dihexadecyldimethylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> (DHDAC). At pH similar to 8. 5 and 25 degrees C, each of these formulations was used eo cleave p-nitrophenyl diphenyl phosphate (PNPDPP). The aggregate and the maximum pseudo-first-order rate constants ([MPP] = 4 x 10 (- 5) M, and [PNPDPP] = 1 x 10 (- 5) M) for the PNPDPP cleavages are the following: buffer alone, 0. 00034 s(- 1); micelle: 0. 024 s(- 1); ME: 0. 0048 s(- 1); and vesicle: 0. 025 s(- 1) Importantly all the catalytic formulations showed ''turnover'' behavior {{in the presence of}} excess substrates. By the combined use of H- 1 - and P- 31 -NMR spectrometry and synthesis, it was possible to provide evidence for the formation of acylated or phosphorylated monoperoxypthalates in the catalytic hydrolyses in cationic surfactant aggregates...|$|E
