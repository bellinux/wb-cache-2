As Hobbes had centred on peace, Petty chose prosperity.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> {{out that}} the {{secondary}} social sharing {{is not limited to}} negative emotional episodes, but instead can occur after positive emotional episodes as well. In one study, 83% of the participants reported some degree of secondary social sharing in response to both positive and negative emotional situation, with no differences found between these two valences. However, there were some qualitative differences between secondary sharing for each: for positive emotional episodes, secondary social sharing was initiated faster and with a higher number of repetitions and targets than for negatives emotional episodes.|$|E
25|$|Before {{considering}} {{the factors that}} motivate the performance paradox, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out that characteristics known as comparability and variability differentiate good performance measures from bad ones. Comparability {{is defined as the}} potential to utilize a performance measure across different settings to horizontally compare performance. Variability is essential because it ensures that evaluations can be recorded on an outcome scale that is extended enough to vertically compare different levels of performance. Within organizations, these two properties are impacted by the use of several weakly correlated performance measures through a mechanism termed the running down process.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{formalism}} {{is defined}} as the science of mind and corresponds to the behavior of animal objects. Human psychology {{is considered to be a}} unique subset of psychological formalism that deals with human behavior at the level of the individual. Because human behavior is immersed in the larger socio-cultural context (level four in the ToK System), human psychology is considered a hybrid discipline that merges the pure science of psychology with the social sciences. It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out that there are other disciplines the ToK System would classify as “hybrids.” Molecular genetics, for example, is a hybrid between chemistry and biology and neuroscience is a hybrid between biology and psychology. As with Henriques' proposed conception of human psychology, both of these disciplines adopt an object level perspective (molecular and cellular, respectively) on phenomena that simultaneously exist as part of meta-level system processes (life and mind, respectively).|$|E

25|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> {{out that}} kanto had now {{moved from the}} stage to the {{recording}} studio. While the subjects {{dealt with in the}} lyrics were stili the same old quarreis between men and women, mixed in with satirical takes on fashion and current events, the songs were being written with the 78 rpm phonograph in mind. So much so that every record label hired their own kanto composers—and rather famous ones at that. With Columbia at the fore, record labels commissioned kanto from Kaptanzade Ali Rıza Bey, Refik Fersan, Dramalı Hasan, Sadettin Kaynak, Cümbüş Mehmet and Mildan Niyazi Bey. The makams were the same but the instrumentation had changed. Kanto were now accompanied by cümbüş (a fretlees banjo like instrument) the ud (a fretless) lute, and calpara (castenets). Foxtrot, Charleston and rumba rhythms dominated. The tunes were being written and sung more tor listening than tor dancing. Female soloists include Makbule Enver, Mahmure, and Neriman; Beşiktaşlı Kemal Senman was the most sought after male singer for duets.|$|E
25|$|During the war the Ottomans {{managed to}} take Sisak. On 24 August 1593 the Ottomans used {{the absence of a}} large army near Sisak, which was defended by 100 soldiers. With strong cannon fire they managed to break through the walls and on 30 August the {{fortress}} surrendered. Sisak was liberated on 11 August 1594, when the Ottoman garrison fled and set the fortress on fire. The Long War ended with the Peace of Zsitvatorok on 11 November 1606, marking the first sign of the suppression of Ottoman expansion into Central Europe and stabilization of the frontier for half a century. Inner Austria with the duchies of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola remained free from Ottoman control. Croatia was also able to maintain its independence from further Ottoman incursions and made some territorial gains following the peace treaty, such as Petrinja, Moslavina and Čazma. It is also <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out that after this first great Ottoman defeat in northwestern Balkans, the Orthodox Christian subjects of the empire, particularly Serbs and Vlachs (who had been loyal and military useful) began then to lose faith in their Muslim masters, and began passing slowly over to the Habsburg side by emigrating from Ottoman-controlled lands to those of the Habsburgs, or even revolting against the Ottomans in their own territory (Uprising in Banat).|$|E
500|$|The {{benefits}} {{for children to}} maintain relationships with both parents have been repeatedly shown in research. [...] Children in joint custody arrangements often report greater levels of satisfaction with the division of time between their parents and children are also less likely to feel torn between their parents when compared with children who are in sole custody arrangements. In addition, children in joint custody arrangements report feeling closer to both parents than children in sole custody arrangements. Joint custody arrangements also appear to benefit the parents. Not only do parents in joint custody arrangements report lower levels of conflict with one another, when compared to those in sole custody arrangements, but joint custody is frequently related to more positive relationships, effective parenting, and lower inter-parental conflict; key factors that ensure a child’s well-being following divorce. However, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out that children are {{far less likely to}} do well with joint custody and sole custody arrangements when their parents used them as pawns or when they consistently witness their parents' frequent, intense, and ongoing conflict.|$|E

500|$|The Pumpkins drew {{inspiration}} {{from a variety of}} other genres, some unfashionable during the 1990s among music critics. Corgan in particular was open about his appreciation of heavy metal, citing Dimebag Darrell of Pantera as his favorite contemporary guitarist. When one interviewer commented to Corgan and Iha that [...] "Smashing Pumpkins is one of the groups that relegitimized heavy metal" [...] and that they [...] "were among the first alternative rockers to mention people like Ozzy and Black Sabbath with anything other than contempt". Corgan went on to rave about Black Sabbath's Master of Reality and Judas Priest's Unleashed in the East. The song [...] "Zero", which reminded Iha of Judas Priest, is an example of what the band dubbed [...] "cybermetal." [...] Post-punk and gothic rock bands like Joy Division/New Order, Bauhaus, The Cure, and Depeche Mode were formative influences on the band, which covered such artists in concert and on record. Corgan also cited Siouxsie and the Banshees [...] saying it was <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> back to bands that influenced them. Psychedelic rock was also referenced often in the band's early recordings; according to Corgan, [...] "In typical Pumpkins fashion, no one at that point really liked loud guitars or psychedelic music so, of course, that's exactly what we had to do." [...] Corgan acknowledged that a chord he jokingly claimed as [...] "the Pumpkin chord" [...] (a G# octave chord at the eleventh fret of a guitar with the low E string played over it), used as the basis for [...] "Cherub Rock", [...] "Drown", and other songs, was in fact previously used by Jimi Hendrix. Other early influences cited by Corgan include Cream, The Stooges, and Blue Cheer.|$|E

2500|$|In Hungary American {{comic book}} {{publishing}} {{dates back to}} the late eighties (see The last decade of communist Hungary section in history chapter), but until the middle of {{the first decade of the}} new millennium these comics were limited to the superhero genre (Batman, Superman, Spider-man, X-men, etc.), children's (well known titles from the TV screen: Tom and Jerry, Disney characters, etc.), humor comics (Garfield). Parallel to the Hungarian comics market moving to the bookstores, publishers put more emphasis on graphic novels. Today Dark Horse Comics and Vertigo titles are just as common editorial picks as DC and Marvel titles. Many groundbreaking, cult comics, graphic novels have their Hungarian edition (i.e. Sandman, , Sin City, Watchmen, Understanding Comics, Maus, etc.) In 2006 31.3% of the comics published for the bookstore market were of American origin (claiming the highest portion), in 2009, despite the fact that the number of American comics grew by 80%, the portion of the total numbers released for the bookstore market decreased to 20.9%. In connection with American comics in Hungary it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out, that more than half of the comics on the newsstand market are of American origin.

The dividing lines do not, it is true, exactly agree; but I think it is a remarkable fact, and something more than a mere coincidence, that they should traverse the same district and approach each other so closely as they do. If, however, I am right in my supposition that the region where the dividing line of the Indo-Malayan and Austro-Malayan regions of zoology can now be drawn, was formerly occupied by a much wider sea than at present, and if man existed on the earth at that period, we shall see good reason why the races inhabiting the Asiatic and Pacific areas should now meet and partially intermingle in the vicinity of that dividing line.|$|E

6000|$|However, let us leave what {{is really}} a very sordid side of the subject, {{and return to the}} {{question}} of popular control in the matter of Art, by which I mean Public Opinion dictating to the artist the form which he is to use, the mode in which he is to use it, and the materials with which he is to work. I have pointed out that the arts which have escaped best in England are the arts in which the public have not been interested. They are, however, interested in the drama, and as a certain advance has been made in the drama within the last ten or fifteen years, it is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out that this advance is entirely due to a few individual artists refusing to accept the popular want of taste as their standard, and refusing to regard Art as a mere matter of demand and supply. With his marvellous and vivid personality, with a style that has really a true colour-element in it, with his extraordinary power, not over mere mimicry but over imaginative and intellectual creation, Mr Irving, had his sole object been to give the public what they wanted, could have produced the commonest plays in the commonest manner, and made as much success and money as a man could possibly desire. But his object was not that. His object was to realise his own perfection as an artist, under certain conditions, and in certain forms of Art. At first he appealed to the few: now he has educated the many. He has created in the public both taste and temperament. The public appreciate his artistic success immensely. I often wonder, however, whether the public understand that that success is entirely {{due to the fact that}} he did not accept their standard, but realised his own. With their standard the Lyceum would have been a sort of second-rate booth, as some of the popular theatres in London are at present. Whether they understand it or not the fact however remains, that taste and temperament have, to a certain extent been created in the public, and that the public is capable of developing these qualities. The problem then is, why do not the public become more civilised? They have the capacity. What stops them? ...|$|E
