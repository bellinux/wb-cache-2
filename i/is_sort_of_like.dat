It was always interesting, having read the books, watching this amalgamation of story lines happen. Benjen <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> the Coldhands character in that he's a slightly suspicious guy who is half-dead and half-alive with blue hands. I thought that was very cool, the way it happened. It was a nice marriage between the book and TV revelations rolled into one. I was very excited having him on set.
