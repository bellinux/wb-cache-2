40|$|In {{multicarrier}} systems, the transmitted time-domain signal exhibits large amplitude peaks. This peak-toaverage {{power ratio}} (PAPR) problem complicates the practical use of multicarrier systems: the amplifier used to {{transmit the signal}} saturates {{because of the large}} peaks and causes non-linear distortion. As this non-linear distortion frustrates severely the detection of the multicarrier signal, the average power of the multicarrier signal must be reduced such that the system operates in the linear part of the amplifier. However, this power reduction comes at the cost of a reduced capacity of the multicarrier system. Hence, several techniques were investigated to reduce the PAPR. In this paper, we compare two PAPR reduction techniques for coded OFDM using an iterative decoder, i. <b>e.</b> <b>clipping</b> and symbol switching. Clipping outperforms the symbol switching technique as for given PAPR reduction, a lower BER degradation is obtained.

40|$|Old age is {{associated}} with poorer movement skill, as indexed by reduced speed and accuracy. Nevertheless, reductions in speed and accuracy can also reflect compensation as well as deficit. We used a manual tracing and a driving task to identify generalized spatial and temporal compensations and deficits associated with old age. In Experiment 1, participants used a hand-held stylus to trace a path. In Experiment 2, participants steered along paths in a virtual reality driving simulator. In both experiments, participants were required {{to stay within the}} boundaries while we manipulated task difficulty by changing path width or movement speed. The older group showed worse performance in the highly constrained conditions. Corner cutting effectively reduces the curvature of bends but yields a greater risk of error (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>clipping</b> the path or road edge). Corner cutting is thus less risky on wider paths, and we found that corner cutting increased for both age groups in both tasks when paths were wider. Crucially, we observed a greater degree of corner cutting in the young group compared with the old, suggesting the old group compensated for decreased motor skill with “middle-of-the-road” behavior. Enforcing increased speed caused all participants to increase corner cutting. Thus, older participants showed spatial compensation for decreased skill by biasing their position toward the middle of the path in both a manual and steering task. External constraints (narrow paths and fast speeds) prevented this strategy and revealed age-related declines in skills central to manual control and driving...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a procedure {{for the creation}} of large-scale video datasets for action classification and localization from unconstrained, realistic web data. The scalability of the proposed procedure is demonstrated by building a novel video benchmark, named SLAC (Sparsely Labeled ACtions), consisting of over 520 K untrimmed videos and 1. 75 M clip annotations spanning 200 action categories. Using our proposed framework, annotating a clip takes merely 8. 8 seconds on average. This represents a saving in labeling time of over 95 % compared to the traditional procedure of manual trimming and localization of actions. Our approach dramatically reduces the amount of human labeling by automatically identifying hard <b>clips,</b> i. <b>e.,</b> <b>clips</b> that contain coherent actions but lead to prediction disagreement between action classifiers. A human annotator can disambiguate whether such a clip truly contains the hypothesized action in a handful of seconds, thus generating labels for highly informative samples at little cost. We show that our large-scale dataset can be used to effectively pre-train action recognition models, significantly improving final metrics on smaller-scale benchmarks after fine-tuning. On Kinetics, UCF- 101 and HMDB- 51, models pre-trained on SLAC outperform baselines trained from scratch, by 2. 0 %, 20. 1 % and 35. 4 % in top- 1 accuracy, respectively when RGB input is used. Furthermore, we introduce a simple procedure that leverages the sparse labels in SLAC to pre-train action localization models. On THUMOS 14 and ActivityNet-v 1. 3, our localization model improves the mAP of baseline model by 8. 6 % and 2. 5 %, respectively. Comment: CVPR submissio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{this thesis}} I studied {{responses}} of three biennial, monocarpic plants Erysimum strictum, Gentianella amarella, and G. campestris, to various aspects in resource availability (i. e. competition, mineral nutrition, neighbor removal) and environmental stress (early frost) at adult or rosette stages {{and how these}} effects are related to grazing tolerance. I also studied how manipulations in resource availability affected arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization of the roots. All three species were relatively tolerant to simulated grazing {{and in most cases}} plants were able to compensate quite well for minor biomass losses. According to the compensatory continuum hypothesis, tolerance is most pronounced in resource-rich conditions, but this was not always the case in the present experiments. Erysimum strictum compensated for defoliation at the rosette stage but the reproductive output of adult plants was reduced markedly in the next year. This reduction was strongest among fertilized plants. Moreover, apex removal at the adult stage resulted in overcompensation (i. <b>e.</b> <b>clipped</b> plants were more productive) but only in the absence of fertilization and in the presence of competition, which is against the compensatory continuum hypothesis. In E. strictum a potential cost of compensation appeared as delayed flowering and fruit maturation among clipped plants. However, in spite of early frost treatment clipped plants were still able to overcompensate. In Gentianella amarella and G. campestris, apex removal reduced growth and reproductive performance in most cases. Effects on root fungal parameters were positive or neutral. This pattern suggests that simulated above-ground herbivory tends to increase carbon limitation, and therefore regrowing shoots and the fungal symbionts may appear as alternative, competing sinks for the limited carbon reserves of the host plant. Both shoot architecture and resource availability modify the responses of the study plants to apical damage at both rosette and adult stages. In addition, different environmental stress factors affect success in compensatory growth...|$|R

To support multiple users, the D-TX system employs a zero-forcing based multiuser multiple-input multiple-output precoding.

The latter constraint {{is to avoid}} severe distortion of transmit signals at a power amplifier, i. <b>e.,</b> the <b>clipping</b> effects.

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} a study of movie review {{entertainment}} (MRE) which is a contemporary Internet-based genre of texts. MRE are movie reviews in video form which are published online, usually as episodes of an MRE web show. Characteristic to MRE is combining humor and honest opinions in varying degrees {{as well as the}} use of subject materials, i. <b>e.</b> <b>clips</b> of the movies, {{as a part of the}} review. The study approached MRE from a linguistic perspective aiming to discover 1) whether MRE is primarily text- or image-based and what the primary functions of the modes are, 2) how a reviewer linguistically combines subject footage to her/his commentary?, 3) whether there is any internal variation in MRE regarding the aforementioned questions, and 4) how suitable the selected models and theories are in the analysis of this type of contemporary multimodal data. To answer the aforementioned questions, the multimodal system of image—text relations by Martinec and Salway (2005) in combination with categories of cohesion by Halliday and Hasan (1976) were applied to four full MRE videos which were transcribed in their entirety for the study. The primary data represent varying types of MRE: a current movie review, an analytic essay, a riff review, and a humorous essay. The results demonstrated that image vs. text prioritization can vary between reviews and also within a review. The current movie review and the two essays were primarily commentary-focused whereas the riff review was significantly more dependent on the use of imagery as the clips are a major source of humor which is a prominent value in that type of a review. In addition to humor, clips are used to exemplify the commentary. A reviewer also relates new information to the imagery as well as uses two modes to present the information in a review. Linguistically, the most frequent case was that the reviewer names participants and processes lexically in the commentary. Grammatical relations (reference items such as pronouns and adverbs and conjunctive items in the riff review) were also encountered. There was internal variation to a considerable degree. The methods chosen were deemed appropriate to answer the research questions. Further study could go beyond linguistics to include, for instance, genre and media studies...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{frictional}} forces between 0. 014 -in NiTi wires (Aditek) with 4 mm horizontal deflection and brackets with different archwire ligation systems. METHODS: Four types of self-ligating brackets (Damon MX, Easy Clip, Smart Clip and In-Ovation), a triple bracket (Synergy) and a twin bracket with 8 -shaped ligature (Tecnident) were tested. Twin brackets with conventional elastomeric ligatures (Morelli) were used as control group. Tests were repeated 10 times for each bracket/archwire combination. Frictional forces were measured in an Instron universal tensile machine at 3 mm/minute speed and a total displacement of 6 mm. Statistical analysis comprised ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple comparison post hoc test. RESULTS: Deflection-induced frictional (DIF) forces increased in the following order: Synergy, Damon, 8 -shaped Ligature, Easy Clip, In-Ovation, Smart-Clip and conventional ligatures. The differences among groups were significant, with the exception of the 8 -shaped ligature groups which was equal to the Damon and Easy Clip groups. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to conventional ligatures, all ligation systems tested reduced frictional forces. However, such reduction varied according to the ligation system employed. OBJETIVO: o objetivo desse trabalho foi comparar as forças de atrito entre fios NiTi 0, 014 " (Aditek) com deformações horizontais de 4 mm, e braquetes com diferentes sistemas de ligação dos arcos.

Como grupo controle, foi utilizado braquete gêmeo com ligadura elástica convencional (Morelli). Foram executadas 10 repetições em cada combinação arco/braquete. As forças de atrito foram medidas em máquina de tração universal Instron, com velocidade de 3 mm/minuto e deslocamento total de 6 mm. Para análise estatística, usou-se a ANOVA e o Teste de Comparações Múltiplas de Dunnett.

To improve depth perception, the Da Vinci robot offers three-dimensional (3 -D) video {{on the console}} for the surgeon but not for assistants, although both must collaborate. We improved the shared perception of the whole surgical team by connecting live 3 -D monitors to all three available Da Vinci generations, probed user experience after two years by questionnaire, and compared time measurements of a predefined complex interaction task performed with a 3 -D monitor versus two-dimensional. Additionally, we investigated whether the complex mental task of reconstructing a 3 -D overview from an endoscopic video can be performed by a computer and shared among users. During the study, 925 robot-assisted laparoscopic procedures were performed in three hospitals, including prostatectomies, cystectomies, and nephrectomies. Thirty-one users participated in our questionnaire. Eighty-four percent preferred 3 -D monitors and 100 % reported spatial-perception improvement.

In this paper, we present an efficient, lightweight and scalable object replication and placement scheme for WMNs. Since the placement problem is NP-Complete, the scheme decom-poses the problem into smaller sub-problems to facilitate the distributed approach in a P 2 P fashion. Moreover, it exploits the long-term link-quality routing metrics to augment the replica placement decision and the instantaneous link-quality metrics for replica server selection. The effectiveness of our scheme is evaluated through extensive simulation studies...|$|R
