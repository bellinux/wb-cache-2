5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E

25|$|Here then De Morgan {{had made}} a great advance by {{introducing}} quantification of the terms. At that time Sir William Hamilton was teaching in Edinburgh a doctrine of the quantification of the predicate, and a correspondence sprang up. However, De Morgan soon perceived that Hamilton's quantification was of a different character; that it meant for example, substituting the two forms The whole of A <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of B, and The whole of A {{is a part of}} B for the Aristotelian form All A's are B's. Hamilton thought that he had placed the keystone in the Aristotelian arch, as he phrased it. Although {{it must have been a}} curious arch which could stand 2000 years without a keystone. As a consequence he had no room for De Morgan's innovations. He accused De Morgan of plagiarism, and the controversy raged for years in the columns of the Athenæum, and in the publications of the two writers.|$|E
25|$|There are {{philosophers}} who {{are concerned}} with the question of fundamentality. That is, which is more ontologically fundamental the parts or their wholes. There are several responses to this question, though one of the default assumptions is that the parts are more fundamental. That <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> is grounded in its parts. This is the mainstream view. Another view, explored by Shaffer (2010) is monism, where the parts are grounded in the whole. Shaffer does not just mean that, say, the parts that make up my body are grounded in my body. Rather, Shaffer argues that the whole cosmos is more fundamental and everything else {{is a part of the}} cosmos. Then, there is the identity theory which claims that there is no hierarchy or fundamentality to parts and wholes. Instead wholes are just (or equivalent to) their parts. There can also be a two-object view which says that the wholes are not equal to the parts—they are numerically distinct from one another. Each of these theories has benefits and costs associated with them.|$|E
25|$|Usually new colonies {{are formed}} by older {{individuals}} who swarm {{and create a}} new nest. The young P. fraternus queens stay behind to keep the older nest alive. The colony cycle begins with a pre-emergence period, which occurs before {{the emergence of the}} first offspring. Pre-emergence colonies have mostly older individuals. After this, the post-emergence period occurs which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> duration of the colony cycle following the appearance of offspring wasps. Next, is the pre-matrifilial phase. This is {{the first part of the}} post-emergence period and occurs when subordinate foundresses are still present in nests, interacting with worker wasps. Following this period is the matrifilial phase, which comes after the disappearance of all subordinates. Colonies now consist of only the queen and her workers. Lastly, there is a reproductive phase, where reproductive offspring (gynes and males) are born. Gynes start emerging from nests around early February; thus any female collected from colonies up to the end of January of each season will most likely be a worker. The colony cycle is usually annual, with foundress females beginning new nests in the spring after having overwintered for about 4.5 months.|$|E
