50|$|In 1961, a new redenominated Soviet ruble was issued. It {{maintained}} <b>exchange</b> <b>parity</b> {{with the}} Pound Sterling until {{the dissolution of}} the USSR in 1991. After a new leadership, headed by Leonid Brezhnev, had come to power, attempts were made to revitalize the economy through economic reform. Starting in 1965, enterprises and organizations were made to rely on economic methods of profitable production, rather than follow orders from the state administration. By 1970, the Soviet economy had reached its zenith and was estimated at about 60 percent {{of the size of the}} USA in terms of the estimated commodities (like steel and coal). In 1989, the official GDP of the Soviet Union was $2,500 Billion while the GDP of the United States was $4,862 Billion with per capita income figures as $8,700 and $19,800 respectively.|$|E

Contrary to popular wisdom, industrialized-country monetary authorities easily have the resources to defend <b>exchange</b> <b>parities</b> against virtually any private speculative attack.

Despite this variability, however, changes in official rates—the discount rate and the rate on fixed term advances—were overwhelmingly linked throughout the ERM period to developments in foreign exchange markets.

40|$|The {{collapse}} of a fixed exchange rate is typically marked by a sudden balance-of-payments crisis in which"speculators" fleeing from the domestic currency acquire {{a large portion of}} the central bank's foreign exchange holdings.

40|$|One of the {{landmark}} {{events in the}} recent history of Cyprus was the adoption of the euro on 1 January 2008. A crucial element of the preparatory discussions between the Cypriot authorities and the competent European bodies was the search for an agreement on the conversion rate of the Cyprus pound vis-a-vis the euro, which was decided by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) on 10 July 2007. This paper describes part of the work undertaken at the Central Bank of Cyprus as background material for these discussions. Using a qualitative and quantitative approach, the paper suggests that the <b>exchange</b> <b>parity</b> rate of the Cyprus pound vis-a-vis the euro which existed {{for a number of years}} prior to euro adoption was broadly in line with economic fundamentals. Evidence examined include the stability of the Cyprus pound vis-a-vis the euro within a credible exchange rate policy framework, robust growth, low levels of unemployment, high Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) coverage of the current account deficit as well as low and stable inflation.

40|$|From parity to {{floating}} currencies : {{the political}} debate on the international monetary System since 1940, Gérard Pogorel During the second world war, {{within the framework of}} the allies negotiations on the post war, the Americans, the English and the French established the foundations of a future international monetary System. The Bretton Woods conference set up in July 1944 the two key institutions — the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The liveliness of the discussions on <b>exchange</b> <b>parity</b> and the use of the gold standard, and the weight of the dollar and of the pound sterling prevented the system from becoming operative until the end of the 1950 s. The creation of the European Common Market and the competitiveness of Europe and Japan then aggravated the tensions between the United States and the rest of the world, especially General de Gaulle's France. A compromise was reached in 1967 with the creation of the Special Drawing Rights. But the economic crisis of the 1970 s and the imbalance of international exchanges resulted in the tri-polar monetary System : the dollar, the yen and the ECU, created in 1979 within the European Monetary System. The failure of an international fiduciary currency is compensated by the flexibility of the new System, even if some heads of state are in the early 1980 s speaking of a new Bretton Woods.

40|$|In early 1991, {{ten years}} before Argentina {{defaulted}} on its international debt and devalued its currency, an {{effort was made to}} address the economic crisis caused by runaway inflation. The subsequent decade, that is the years after 2000, saw the failure of the policies then put in place and marks one of the most tragic periods in the country’s economic history. During the 90 s, the country underwent ‘neoliberal’ market reforms centered on open trade and access to capital markets, fiscal responsibility, and a stable currency. According to Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize winner in the field of economics and author of Argentina, short-changed: Why the nation that followed the rules fell to pieces, the policies implemented during the 1990 s were doomed to fail. The most influential piece of the policy reforms was the convertibility law, which equated the Argentine peso with the US Dollar. Maintaining this <b>exchange</b> <b>parity</b> was of the utmost importance to the country at the time and depended on two measures: the sale of state assets and international borrowing. In this thesis I will study the relationship between these two policies through an analysis of Domingo Cavallo’s account, Argentina’s economic minister from 1991 to 1995. By examining his speeches, articles and interviews, and by studying the process of selling state assets in it of itself, I argue that the minister believed that privatization made access to capital markets possible. The story I am telling and my analysis of it obviously have a deeper history that is essentially social and political, but this thesis does not try to place the policies or Cavallo himself in that history except by implication. Instead, I am focusing on the monetary and fiscal history itself: how privatization worked, how it made it possible for Argentina to borrow in international markets; to the extent possible from published data, I am also assessing {{the extent to which the}} combination of privatization and borrowing actually worked to restore fiscal health – and when it no longer did...|$|E

40|$|While {{the causes}} of the {{collapse}} of cooperation in maintaining the international gold standard are subject to debate (the lack of a dominant central bank to coordinate global monetary policy versus the nonreflection of disparate inflation rates in <b>exchange</b> rate <b>parities,</b> for example), there is general agreement over the transmission method that lead to the breakdown, namely, that contractionary monetary policies were enacted {{in order to maintain the}} standard, and that these policies were exported to other countries. This breakdown in cooperation resulted in the standard's loss of credibility, causing monetary authorities to shift policy priorities toward defending <b>exchange</b> rate <b>parities,</b> and thus injected massive interest rate uncertainty into the economy, which in turn, lead to a large reduction in aggregate spending. Ferderer proposes that interest rate uncertainty was an additional transmission mechanism leading to the collapse of the interwar gold standard.

If African-grown rice were cheaper than rice imported from Asia, then the large Irrigated rice-growing areas might be more successful. The same applies to the Improved development of profitable market-gardening. It is not the skill of the farmers that needs to be improved, but market conditions. If I look back at irrigated farming practices in the Sahel during the 1980 s, I see two outcomes. Firstly, the failure of the large projects which were financed by aid agencies. Vast sums were spent on developing river basins and on creating and improving irrigated areas mainly for rice-growing. The governments of the Sahelian states, in an attempt to reach self-sufficiency in food, had been pressing for such schemes. But the opposite happened. A decade ago the Sahel was producing about 50 % of the rice it needed; now the figure stands at less than 30 %. Secondly, there has been a simultaneous proliferation of small-scale irrigated areas, run on market gardening principles by peasant farmers and town-dwellers who have returned to the land. These people have invested their savings in their rice farms and have built them up on a shoestring budget. They have flourished, creating a landscape of vitality and hope, in spite of limited external assistance So on the one hand we have complex but ineffective schemes dreamed up and put into operation with considerable effort by experts of some experience, and on the other we have self-help initiatives, often lacking in know-how, but which frequently succeed. Why is this? The answer seems obvious to me. Dietary fashions change, and city-dwellers, for example, eat more vegetables than they once did. The demand for market-garden produce has increased and astute businessmen have sought to exploit the trend. They face little competition because geography is on their side: courgettes and beans from southern Europe would be far too expensive to be sold on the Bamako or Niamey markets. Rice production too was able to benefit from a change in dietary habits, since both town and country people are eating more rice and less of the traditional sorghum and millet. But rice-growers are less fortunate than those who produce vegetables as rice travels well and cheaply. Thai rice arrives in Niger costing less than the home-grown variety. African governments do not have the option open to developed countries of subsidizing farmers by taxing industrialists, nor can they impose prohibitive import taxes on rice since some less scrupulous neighbouring country might let it in and then re-export it on the black market. As a result, small-scale farmers produce rice for their own needs, send a little to the towns, and then perhaps allow some to be marketed elsewhere as long as the price is right and they actually receive hard cash. But they feel no incentive to put rice on a market where they have no chance of being competitive. And so rice imports grow and self-sufficiency declines. It is really not a fair comparison between vegetables and rice, as people will always eat far more rice than tomatoes, radishes and carrots. As a result of growing trade deficits, aid is now being poured in urgently to bridge the gaps in the budgets of African countries, instead of being used to help Africa invest in her future. What chance development? It is fashionable to go on about international markets and to deplore the fact that Thailand grows rice and Malaysia produces cocoa at less cost than Africa, but this is just unhelpful repetition. The plain fact is that Africa is no longer geared to a world market. She has become marginalized in world trade and is increasingly an importing continent. There can be only one answer to this permanent block to development, and that is to adopt <b>exchange</b> <b>parity.</b> Changing the exchange rates is not some magic solution, because only this step can push Africa into development. Not only should rice be dearer, but so also should petrol, foreign cars, foreign travel etc. The interaction between social groups will also have to undergo a major modification. Is Africa ready for alI this? Are there any indicators to show that things are happening? If there are, then there is some hope that the continent might come through the current crisis and head for real development. If not, then there is little that can be done.
