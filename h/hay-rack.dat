60|$|After {{one look}} at the boys, {{probably}} {{to make sure they were}} the same ones whom they had seen coming up the road, the thieves ceased their efforts to move the <b>hay-rack,</b> and sought safety in flight, running down the road towards Babcock, instead of trying to escape in the opposite direction.|$|E
60|$|This {{suggestion}} {{was so good}} that they followed it at once. Bob using his horses to haul a <b>hay-rack,</b> a heavy ox-cart and two dump-carts into the road, about two {{hundred yards from the}} highway, overturning and wedging them in {{in such a way that}} a passage through could not be made in less than half an hour.|$|E
6000|$|But now {{his real}} trouble and bewilderment began. A carload of new {{furniture}} and [...] "fixin's" [...] was sidetracked at the junction, and McNutt {{was ordered to}} get it unloaded and carted to the farm without delay. There were four <b>hay-rack</b> loads of the [...] "truck," [...] altogether, {{and when it was}} all dumped into the big empty barn at the Wegg farm the poor agent {{had no idea what to}} do with it.|$|E
50|$|On some farms {{the loose}} hay was {{stored in a}} barrack, shed, or barn, {{normally}} {{in such a way}} that it would compress down and cure. Hay could be stored in a specially designed barn with little internal structure to allow more room for the hay loft. Alternatively, an upper storey of a cow-shed or stable was used, with hatches in the floor to allow hay to be thrown down into <b>hay-racks</b> below.|$|R
50|$|In 1909 {{a stable}} was erected {{to the north}} of the Stock Experiment Station Main Building. The Department of Agriculture and Stock Annual Report for 1910 {{described}} the building:"The stable provide four stalls, a loose-box, and feed-room, with a room for harness, tools, etc., and another room for small animals, specially ventilated. The manger fittings are of iron, with water-pots and <b>hay-racks</b> combined. The floors of stalls are laid with a special channelled stable brick, and a tramway is laid the whole length of the building with an overhead traveller for removing the carcasses of dead animals."A similar building of 12 stalls, designated as cattle byres, was erected immediately to the north but it does not survive. The total cost of the complex to October 1909 was Â£5,000.|$|R
60|$|Already had {{the two men}} {{succeeded in}} {{removing}} the two dump-carts, and were now at work upon the <b>hay-rack,</b> with every prospect of pulling it sufficiently {{out of the way}} to admit of their driving past; but when they saw the three boys coming down the road, they evidently concluded that they had worked quite as long as was safe, for they began to look out for their own welfare, instead of trying longer to get away with the team.|$|E
50|$|The hayloft {{is filled}} with loose hay {{from the top of}} a wagon, thrown up through a large door, usually some 3 m or more above the ground, often in the gable end of the building. Some haylofts have slots or holes (sometimes with hatches), each above a <b>hay-rack</b> or manger in the animal housing below. The hay could easily be dropped through the holes to feed the animals.|$|E
