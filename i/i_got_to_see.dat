25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the world. I {{used to think that}} World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E
500|$|Wasteland Angel {{received}} average reviews upon release, garnering {{a rating}} of 55% on the review aggregation website GameRankings. Gamers Daily News' Jeff Lindsey appreciated the perspective change accompanying the bonus level, stating, [...] "To be perfectly honest, I squealed with delight when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the carnage first hand and create mayhem before your eyes." [...] Strategy Informer was not as appreciative of the jump in perspective, noting that the game's maps and engine {{did not appear to}} be designed for the first-person perspective and the mode instead presented itself as [...] "more than a little jarring." [...] While Travis Huinker of Gaming Nexus criticized the game for having poor driving physics, Shack News's Jeff Mattas enjoyed the controls, stating, [...] "Though there are certain liberties taken with the driving physics, they feel right at home with the frantic, arcade-style action." [...] Ultimately, Huinker did not recommend the game, but Lindsey called it [...] "the most fun game that I have played this year".|$|E
2500|$|Kojima {{also said}} about her clothing, [...] "Once {{you see how}} she fits into the story, you will {{understand}} why she looks the way she does. Without any of this background I can certainly understand why there are concerns. I will say there’s a reason she looks the way she does and wears those clothes. And it’s all {{a part of the}} game, learning those reasons one by one." [...] Joosten herself was surprised with the controversy, but said [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her design, I was shocked too. But everybody didn’t get to hear her story yet so I can understand people are angry about it or saying she is showing too much. But I am not bothered by it.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{one or two}} others. We {{will write}} and let you know," [...] was the {{conclusion}} of each interview, and the end, as far as I was concerned, of the enterprise.|$|R

Director Kevin Smith said, [...] "I shared some air & some air time with the man on O & he was always funny & thoughtful. He WILL be missed."

[...] The Roots drummer Questlove mourned [...] "so grateful <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Patrice O'Neal do his last NYC gig. Man, this is so devastating. He truly was one of my favorite comics." [...] Nick Cannon called him [...] "An amazing comedian and an even better person." [...] Actor Charlie Sheen paid his respects through his blog, saying: [...] "The entertainment world as well as the world at large lost a brilliant man today. Patrice had that rare 'light' around him and inside of him. I only knew him for the few days leading up the Roast. Yet I will forever be inspired by his nobility, his grace and his epic talent. My tears today are for the tremendous loss to his true friends and loving family." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We 'ad a lot o' trouble wi' {{this one}} yesterday.

So here we are," [...] and he laughed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know he says so," [...] said Gabriel, soothingly; [...] "but he'll {{get over}} that. That's what Stimson sed {{when he was}} took worse, but he got over that, and <b>I</b> never <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him except in time to lay him out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye're a dour, crabbit Englishman and no' as clever as ye think," [...] Macallister rejoined. [...] "Ye had {{not been}} gone ten minutes when I kenned what ye were after and {{reckoned}} <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> ye oot. Ye didna ken I talk Aver-r-rack?" ...|$|R
60|$|If I had {{not been}} angry clear through at that cub I might have let go. He {{ploughed}} {{my face in the}} dirt, and almost jerked my arms off. Suddenly the strain lessened. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> up, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that the old hunter had hold of the other rope.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{like to put}} a {{question}} to ye, Mr. Hamlin," [...] said Gabriel, with great gentleness,--"allowin' in course, ye'll answer or no jest ez as is agree'ble to ye--reckonin' it's no business o' mine nor pryin' into secrets, ony jess to pass away the time ontil sundown.

6000|$|... "It {{was through}} my own love of horses that I became {{friendly}} with Venters. He {{and his wife}} attended my church, and as <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more of them, gradually we grew intimate. And {{it was not until}} I did get intimate with them that I realized that both seemed to be haunted by the past. They were sometimes sad even in their happiness. They drifted off into dreams. They lived back in another world. They seemed to be listening. Indeed, they were a singularly interesting couple, and I grew genuinely fond of them. By and by they had a little girl whom they named Jane. The coming of the baby made a change in my friends. They were happier, and I observed that the haunting shadow did not so often return.|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Jefferson. [...] "Well, I allow we {{want you}} to stop. There's another thing. I {{understand}} my partner kind of promised a boat would go. Sometimes he's rash, but <b>I</b> feel I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him out." ...|$|R

[...] Finnegan said, [...] "It was very cool that it was Italy. It was my second time there, but my first year I didn’t get to compete because I injured my back.

"In 1959, {{with eyes}} the same size, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> some of America {{traveling}} in the old green Plymouth with my parents, who couldn't stand each other, and my brother and sister, who loved everyone. brother Michael actually died in an accident on March 20, 1955. I remember the Erie Canal on a dismal day, the Maine coastline in a storm, Georgia willow trees in the rain, and the Luray Caverns in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia where the stalagmites and -tites were poorly lit." ...|$|E
5000|$|When Yusuf {{appeared}} on The Chris Isaak Hour in 2009, {{he said of}} this song: [...] "I was on a holiday in Spain. I was a kid from the West End (of London) - bright lights, et cetera. <b>I</b> never <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the moon on its own in the dark, there were always streetlamps. So there I was {{on the edge of}} the water on a beautiful night with the moon glowing, and suddenly I looked down and saw my shadow. I thought that was so cool, I'd never seen it before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, by the way," [...] {{he added}} aloud, [...] "did {{you happen to}} hear anybody moving in the house last night, Mr. Bingham, just when the storm was at its height?

But my candle went out {{and by the time}} that I had found a light {{there was nothing to be}} seen." ...|$|R
60|$|I did not troll {{across the}} channel between the islands. There {{was a big}} swell running, and four hours of {{it gave me a}} disagreeable feeling. Now and then <b>I</b> <b>got</b> up <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how far off Clemente was. And upon the last of these {{occasions}} I saw the fins of a swordfish right across our bow. I yelled to Captain Dan. He turned the boat aside, almost on top of the swordfish. Hurriedly I put a bait on my hook and got it overboard, and let the line run. Then I looked about for the swordfish. He had gone down.|$|R
5000|$|Speaking of the album's influences, Ringwald said, [...] "I {{had quite}} the musical repertoire; {{it was pretty}} much {{traditional}} jazz but there was some Bessie Smith and Helen Kane, the original Betty Boop." [...] Inspirations for the album also included Ella Fitzgerald, Blossom Dearie, and Susannah McCorkle. [...] "Blossom Dearie was the only one <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> live. Susannah's recordings have really influenced me. I think she was really special in her gifts of interpretation and how much humanity she brought to the songs." ...|$|E
5000|$|It was {{directed}} by Jim Wynorski who in 2013 {{said it was the}} one movie of his he regretted making. [...] "I can look back on it today and just say [...] "Oh well", but back when the memories were fresh and the blood on the floor was yet to dry, it was painful to even edit," [...] he said. [...] "What went wrong??? Wrong choice for the star, massive union problems in Vegas, studio interference, theft, accidents, 112 degree heat, you name it, we had it happen. But as least <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Soupy Sales perform." ...|$|E
5000|$|Feeling a tad disillusioned {{that music}} as easily likable as his should {{experience}} such difficulties gaining a wider and wider audience, Lucien stopped recording {{for a while}} and was not heard from again until the release of 1991's Listen Love on Mercury, followed by 1993's Mother Nature's Son. Both albums went a long way toward refreshing his original fans' memories of his unique artistry, picking up some new ones along the way as well. Jon explains, [...] "Wherever I perform, I hear all the time, 'I'm 18, I'm 19, but my mom turned me on to your music when I was 10, {{and this is the first}} chance <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you.'

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> out <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{about some}} tea for my {{traveling}} companions, {{and looked up}} at the outside passengers. One of them seated in the dickey looked down at me. He was a countryman in a smock-frock, with a green patch over one of his eyes. Something in the expression of his uncovered eye made me pause--reflect--turn away uneasily--and then look again at him furtively. A sudden shudder ran through me from top to toe; my heart sank; and my head began to feel giddy. The countryman in the dickey was no other than the Bow Street runner in disguise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{we worked}} {{a year in}} Melbourne to raise the wind. Tom, (he made me call him Tom, sir), bein' a clever fellow, got into a store as a clerk, an' <b>I</b> <b>got</b> work as a porter at the quays; an' though his work was more gentlemanly than mine, I made very near as much as him, so we lived comfortable, and laid by a little.

She has recalled some portions of her childhood as [...] "painful", explaining that [...] "I loved my father very much and <b>I</b> only <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him during the school holidays.

5000|$|Tony Kornheiser, whose ballot was {{topped by}} Ruth, Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan, said, [...] "I can't {{conceive}} of how Ruth didn't finish number one. He {{had the greatest}} impact of anybody on a sport by far... Michael Jordan didn't have as many championships as Bill Russell and didn't score as many points as Wilt Chamberlain, and really didn't do anything to advance his sport, so maybe in retrospect I upgraded him {{a bit too much}} because the way he performed was so spectacular, and because of television <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> highlights. They may have overpersuaded a lot of us... Did Jim Thorpe get the praise he deserved? Probably not, because there weren't enough people old enough to really remember him." ...|$|E

5000|$|During production, Aames and Cates both {{decided that}} the film did not need as much nudity as the script set out.

To have to mix night after night with a mob who think that life {{is a sort of}} St. Vitus's dance, and imagine that they're having a good time because they're making enough noise for six and drinking too much for ten. I loathe New York, Bertie. I wouldn't come near the place if <b>I</b> hadn't <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> editors occasionally. There's a blight on it. It's got moral delirium tremens. It's the limit. The very thought of staying more than a day in it makes me sick. And you call this thing pretty soft for me!" ...|$|R
