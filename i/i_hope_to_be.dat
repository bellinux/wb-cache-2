500|$|Lee divided {{his forces}} into {{multiple}} columns, spread apart widely {{as he moved}} into Maryland and also maneuvered to capture the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry. This was a risky move for a smaller army, but Lee was counting on his knowledge of McClellan's temperament. He told one of his generals, [...] "He is an able general but a very cautious one. His army {{is in a very}} demoralized and chaotic condition, and will not be prepared for offensive operations—or he will not think it so—for three or four weeks. Before that time <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the Susquehanna." [...] This was not a completely accurate assessment, but McClellan's army was moving lethargically, averaging only [...] a day.|$|E
500|$|In March 2010, Nesbitt {{accepted}} the ceremonial position of Chancellor of the University of Ulster, succeeding former Lord Mayor of London Sir Richard Nichols. Gerry Mallon, then-chair {{of the university}} ruling council, expected Nesbitt to [...] "bring considerable energy, dynamism and commitment" [...] to the post. Following his official installation on 8 June 2010, Nesbitt said, [...] "Rather than being just an informal role officiating at ceremonies, I think I can act as an ambassador. I have access to {{an awful lot of}} people and places because of my work. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a voice that can be heard, not just at the university, but also outside promoting the importance of the funding of education. If that involves me being at Stormont, then I'd be very happy to do that. Clearly these public spending cuts are going to have an impact and it's important to fight for funding because it's about investing in students and investing in the future of Northern Ireland. I believe I can bring something to that, otherwise I wouldn't have taken this on." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from Moncton, Schmirler felt physically well, but suffered a setback when a CAT scan revealed spots around her lungs. The {{decision was made}} not to proceed with further chemotherapy, but she continued with the orthomolecular therapy. She {{had been scheduled to}} work the 2000 Scott Tournament of Hearts, but was unable to do so. She faxed a statement from the hospital, which was read by TSN's Vic Rauter. [...] "I'm still fighting hard and I still hope {{to make it to the}} Brier, not playing but talking. For Saskatchewan, I was hoping to be in your green shoes (at the Scott). But keep things in perspective. There are other things in life besides curling, which I have found. But <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the curling trail again next year. And I'll see you all in Sudbury (the next Scott site) in 2001. Your curling friend, Sandra." [...] However, the optimism in her statement belied the seriousness of her condition. She had been moved to palliative care. She died in her sleep at the Pasqua Hospital Palliative Care Unit on the morning of March 2, 2000 at age 36.|$|E

500|$|In September 2014, Wirkola {{announced}} {{that he would not be}} returning to direct the sequel: “I have been lately attached to a few more things, it’s just a matter of time and priorities. I did Dead Snow, then Hansel & Gretel, and then [...] I want to do something a little bit different now and not just do sequels. I did write the script and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in it. But yeah, I won’t be directing it.” He said [...] "the first film was a learning curve for me working in the studio system and the script I wrote for the original was so different [...] We ended up taking a lot out and altering stuff that first time. I tried taking what I learned and still delivered a sequel script that’s an R-rated action film." [...] Cinema Blend reported Renner said that despite his busy schedule he agreed to reprise the role of Hansel because the first film [...] "was a lot of fun doing the movie," [...] but without Wirkola directing again he might be less likely to return for the sequel.|$|E

In a {{statement}} released on the day after Allen's death, Benny said, [...] "People have often asked me if Fred Allen and I were really friends in real life. My answer is always the same. You couldn't have such a long-running and successful feud as we did, without having a deep and sincere friendship at the heart of it." [...] Allen himself wrote, [...] "For years people have been asking me if Jack and I are friendly. I don't think that Jack Benny has an enemy in the world....

2500|$|Due to the scandal, Haggard went on {{administrative}} leave from New Life saying [...] "I am voluntarily stepping aside from leadership {{so that the}} overseer process can be allowed to proceed with integrity. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to discuss this matter in more detail at a later date. In the interim, I will seek both spiritual advice and guidance." [...] On November 2, 2006, senior church officials told Colorado Springs television station KKTV that Haggard had admitted {{to some of the}} claims made by Jones. In an e-mail to New Life Church parishioners sent on the evening of November 2, Acting Senior Pastor Ross Parsley wrote, [...] "It is important for you to know that he [...] confessed to the overseers that some of the accusations against him are true." [...] Haggard admitted that he had purchased methamphetamine and received a massage from Jones, but he denied using the drugs or having sex with Jones.|$|E
2500|$|French missionary Simon Bruté {{spent two}} decades as teacher and pastor in the {{formative}} years of Mount St. Mary's. He was considered [...] "one {{of the foremost}} scholars in America," [...] {{and he had a}} great deal of influence on the Catholic Church in America. In 1834, he was appointed the founding bishop of the Diocese of Vincennes, Indiana. In 1832, Father Stephen Badin of Indiana purchased 524 acres of land surrounding two lakes near South Bend, Indiana, and when he retired in 1835 he deeded the property to the Diocese of Vincennes. It was Father Badin's dream that a school would be established there. Bruté visited the South Bend property and described it as [...] "a most desirable spot, and one soon <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> occupied by some prosperous institution." [...] In 1836, Bruté traveled to France seeking funds and priests for his diocese, and one of the priests he recruited was Father Edward Sorin, the founder of Notre Dame. After Bruté's death in 1839, his successor, Bishop Hailandière, offered the 524 acre South Bend property to Father Sorin for the purpose of starting a college. The school was founded in 1842 as [...] "L’Université de Notre Dame du Lac" [...] (The University of Our Lady of the Lake). and grew to become the University of Notre Dame and its sister school Saint Mary's College.|$|E
2500|$|When Cao Cao, a warlord {{who rose}} to {{prominence}} in {{the final years of}} the Han dynasty and became the de facto head of the Han central government, was still relatively unknown to others, he once visited Qiao Xuan. Qiao Xuan was surprised to see Cao Cao and he told him, [...] "The world is about to enter a state of chaos. You're the person who will restore peace and order!" [...] At the time, Qiao Xuan and He Yong were the only two persons who felt that Cao Cao was extraordinary. Cao Cao later often said that Qiao Xuan was someone who really understood him. The Wei Shu (魏書) recorded that Qiao Xuan told Cao Cao, [...] "I've seen many famous persons but I've never seen someone like you before! You should work hard. I'm old already! <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to entrust my family to you." [...] Cao Cao's fame increased after his meeting with Qiao Xuan. The Shishuo Xinyu recorded that when Qiao Xuan met Cao Cao, who was still a youth then, he told him, [...] "The world is in chaos and warlords are fighting for supremacy. Aren't you the person who will eliminate all of them and restore order? You're actually a hero in chaotic times but a villain in times of peace. It's a pity that I'm old already because I won't be able to see you become wealthy and powerful. I entrust my descendants to you." [...] Qiao Xuan also recommended Cao Cao to see Xu Shao, a well-known commentator and character evaluator.|$|E
