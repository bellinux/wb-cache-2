Sample, III, from AOL's TV Squad, joked, [...] "Boone's {{mother is}} the devil. <b>How</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> make us sympathize with Shannon right before killing her {{off of the}} show." [...] Virginia Rohan of The Seattle Times thought the [...] "death of troubled Shannon, {{just as she was}} {{becoming}} more likable and had found love with Sayid, was sadder than the first-season death of her stepbrother, Boone. Still, it would grieve me far more to lose Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Locke, Sun or Jin." [...] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune felt fans echoed this view, describing their reaction as [...] "muted," [...] as they were more angry at Ana Lucia for shooting Shannon. Maggie Grace co-won the 2005 Screen Actors Guild Award for [...] "Best Ensemble - Drama Series.

500|$|While {{he appears}} to have been {{attracted}} to young women throughout his life, and there is a strong suggestion in his letters that in his early years he had a sexual encounter with one of his models and possibly also a sexual encounter of some kind while in Venice, there is no suggestion that he ever had a sexual relationship with Betsy of any kind. He recorded in his diary in 1830 that [...] "it is best I have not married because I have not noisy Children and can have nice Books, and Pictures etc". He suffered from extreme shyness throughout his life, and when compelled to attend dinner parties would often sit silent throughout, although he was popular with fellow artists and students. Etty rarely socialised, preferring to concentrate on his painting; when on one occasion it was suggested that he had little further need of training and need not continue attending classes, he indignantly replied that [...] "it fills up a couple of hours in the evening, I should be at a loss <b>how</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> employ".|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly gave a [...] "B+" [...] rating to {{the first}} half of the film and a [...] "C-" [...] rating to the second half, and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "As {{political}} theater, Che moves from faith to impotence, which is certainly a valid reading of Communism in the 20th century. Yet as drama, that makes the second half of the film borderline deadly ... Che is twice as long as it needs to be, but it is also only half the movie it should have been". James Verniere of The Boston Herald gave the film a B-, describing the work as a new genre of [...] "arthouse guerrilla nostalgia", while lamenting Che as the film version of Alberto Korda’s iconic 1960 photograph Guerrillero Heroico. In Verniere's view, so much information was missing, that he recommended one first see The Motorcycle Diaries to fill in the background. In her review for USA Today, Claudia Puig wrote, [...] "With its lyrical beauty and strong performances, the film can be riveting. Its excessive length and rambling scenes also make it maddening. It is worth seeing for its attention to visual detail and ambitious filmmaking, but as a psychological portrait of a compelling historical figure, it is oddly bland and unrevealing". Anthony Lane, in his review for The New Yorker, wrote, [...] "for all the movie’s narrative momentum, Che retains the air of a study exercise—of an interest brilliantly explored. <b>How</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> explain one’s total flatness of feeling at the climax of each movie?" [...] Taking a more positive stance, film critic Chris Barsanti compared Che to a [...] "guerrilla take on Patton", calling it [...] "an exceptionally good" [...] war film, which rivaled The Battle of Algiers in its [...] "you-are-there sensibility". Roger Ebert awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and addressed the film's length: [...] "You may wonder if the film is too long. I think there's a good reason for its length. Guevara's experience in Cuba and especially Bolivia was not a series of events and anecdotes, but a trial of endurance that might almost be called mad".|$|E

We analyse such perlocutionary goals and rhetorical organizations in a ‘special’ dialogue, i. e. a selected passage from Arthur Schnitzler’s novel Fräulein Else: while reading a letter received from her mother, Else builds up, at a space-time distance, a ‘fictional dialogue’ with her. We analyze <b>how</b> <b>Else’s</b> mother rhetorically organizes the letter in order to convince her daughter, <b>how</b> <b>Else</b> reacts <b>to</b> the letter in her own ‘inner world’, <b>how</b> <b>Else</b> verbally reacts <b>to</b> the letter and what decision she takes.

Basically, the vocabulary needed depends on the context of use.On the other hand, the basic structure of concepts is less controversial: it is generally agreed that emotions involve triggers, appraisals, feelings, expressive behavior including physiological changes, and action tendencies; emotions in their entirety can be described in terms of categories or a small number of dimensions; emotions have an intensity, and so on.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Theater as {{representation}} (TAR) {{has been}} used in pre-service and in-service teacher and administrator preparation programs since 1998. This paper places TAR within a pedagogical arena that further solidifies its place as an instrument for leadership professional development in B. Ed., M. Ed., and in-service programs. Maxine Greene (1995) challenges us to seek the use of imagination within our pre-service teacher preparation programs. … It is difficult for me to teach educational history or philosophy to teachers-to-be without engaging them in the domain of imagination and metaphor. <b>How</b> <b>else</b> are they <b>to</b> make meaning out of the discrepant things they learn? <b>How</b> <b>else</b> are they <b>to</b> see themselves as practitioners, working to choose, working to teach in an often indecipherable world? (p. 99) The use of imagination and metaphor are foundational infrastructure girders in teaching pedagogy. But more often than not, our pre and in service teachers and administrators have seen their imagination and understanding of metaphor in creative adventures somewhat stifled (if not put into stasis) with their secondary school and undergraduate educational experiences. The field of educational administrator preparation is going in different directions in a number of provincial and state jurisdictions. Clearly with many politically and fiscally conservative minded governments coming to power, much of the current legislation has skewed the field to {{what seems to be a}} more right-wing, rules-based approach to school governance. For many Masters students, the degree itself is more of a means towards a financial scale upgrade or job requirement more than for true professional development. For pre-service teachers, a surface knowledge of such administrative tasks as classroom management, negligence liability, reporting responsibilities and due process in student academic and behavioral assessment(s) have become virtually obligatory.
