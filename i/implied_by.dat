5|$|Adamant {{was based}} at the Nore, {{operating}} in the North Sea and blockading the Dutch fleet at the Texel with Admiral Adam Duncan's fleet. In May 1797 mutiny broke out among the ships at the Nore, following on from one at Spithead earlier in the year. Of the two-decker ships of the fleet, only the crews of Duncan's flagship , and Hotham's crew aboard Adamant remained loyal. With only two ships available to blockade the Dutch, Duncan and Hotham took their ships out to sea, remaining in sight of the Dutch coast and for several weeks <b>implied</b> <b>by</b> false signals and manoeuvres, {{that the rest of}} the fleet was just over the horizon. Convinced by the impersonation that the blockade was still in force, the Dutch remained in port. Duncan and Hotham were later reinforced by the Russian squadron based at Harwich, and then by ships deserting the mutiny one by one.|$|E
5|$|Although Bede's {{narrative}} is widely accepted, an alternative chronology {{has been proposed}} by D.P. Kirby. Kirby points out that Boniface's letter to Æthelburg {{makes it clear that}} the news of Eadbald's conversion is recent, and that it is unthinkable that Boniface would not have been kept {{up to date on the}} status of Eadbald's conversion. Hence Eadbald must have been converted by Justus, as is <b>implied</b> <b>by</b> Boniface's letter to Justus. The pallium accompanying that letter indicates Justus was archbishop by that time, and the duration of Mellitus's archiepiscopate means that even if Bede's dates are somewhat wrong in other particulars, Eadbald was converted no earlier than 621, and no later than April 624, since Mellitus consecrated a church for Eadbald before his death in that month. The account of Laurence's miraculous scourging by St Peter can be disregarded as a later hagiographical invention of the monastery of St Augustine.|$|E
5|$|As <b>implied</b> <b>by</b> its name, the {{championship}} {{could only be}} won on television or on pay-per-view events. The title was won in one Canadian municipality and in five American states. The inaugural champion was Johnny Hotbody, who defeated Larry Winters at a live event to win the title in August 1992. Rhino, who won the title in September 2000, was the final wrestler to hold the title before ECW filed for bankruptcy. 2 Cold Scorpio had the most reigns as champion, with four. At 700 days, Rob Van Dam's reign from 1998 to 2000 was the longest in the title's history. The Tazmaniac and 2 Cold Scorpio's reigns in 1994 were the shortest title reigns at less than one day. Overall, there were 31 title reigns.|$|E

5|$|Criticisms of Keynes's ideas {{had begun}} to gain {{significant}} acceptance by the early 1970s, as they were then {{able to make a}} credible case that Keynesian models no longer reflected economic reality. Keynes himself included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his General Theory. For economists such as Hyman Minsky, Keynes's limited use of mathematics was partly the result of his scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models. Nevertheless, many models were developed by Keynesian economists, with a famous example being the Phillips curve which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. It implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation. In 1968 Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship <b>implied</b> <b>by</b> the Philips curve did not exist.|$|E
5|$|Gamma, {{the team}} leader and main {{combatant}} of Zombiepowder.s cast, is a 22-year-old powder hunter who desires the zombie powder {{for the sake}} of immortality, and has already obtained one Ring of the Dead at his introduction in the first chapter. Due to numerous past violent crimes, Gamma {{is one of the most}} wanted criminals in the Zombiepowder. universe, with a bounty to match. This high bounty was one of the first things determined about Gamma's character by Tite Kubo, dating back to a pre-draft rendition of the character who was a sort of samurai. Gamma's personal history is never expounded upon, but it is <b>implied</b> <b>by</b> Balmunk that he was once a mercenary, but reformed and became a powder hunter following the death of a woman.|$|E
5|$|Observers {{hoped that}} the impacts would give them a first glimpse of Jupiter beneath the cloud tops, as lower {{material}} was exposed by the comet fragments punching through the upper atmosphere. Spectroscopic studies revealed absorption lines in the Jovian spectrum due to diatomic sulfur (S2) and carbon disulfide (CS2), the first detection of either in Jupiter, and only the second detection of S2 in any astronomical object. Other molecules detected included ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The amount of sulfur <b>implied</b> <b>by</b> the quantities of these compounds was {{much greater than the}} amount that would be expected in a small cometary nucleus, showing that material from within Jupiter was being revealed. Oxygen-bearing molecules such as sulfur dioxide were not detected, to the surprise of astronomers.|$|E

5|$|The sand whiting is an inshore species, inhabiting exposed {{coastal areas}} such as beaches, sandbars and surf zones as well as quieter bays, {{estuaries}} and coastal lakes. Sand whiting enter estuaries, including intermittently open ones, and penetrate far upstream to the tidal limits of rivers and creeks where juveniles and adolescent fish may be abundant. The adults congregate around the mouths of estuaries, bars, and spits, in depths down to 5 m where they may constitute {{a large percentage of}} the icthyofauna of such regions. As <b>implied</b> <b>by</b> their name, they are often found exclusively over sandy substrates, with occasional appearances in Zostera seagrass beds. Individuals are occasionally taken in offshore waters to 40 m during winter.|$|E
5|$|This {{policy was}} {{realized}} as NSC-68, a classified report {{issued by the}} United States National Security Council in April 1950 and written by Paul Nitze, Kennan's successor as director of policy planning. Kennan and Charles Bohlen, another State Department expert on Russia, argued about the wording of NSC-68, which became the basis of Cold War policy. Kennan rejected the idea that Stalin had a grand design for world conquest implicit in Nitze's report and argued that he actually feared overextending Russian power. Kennan even argued that NSC-68 {{should not have been}} drafted at all, as it would make U.S. policies too rigid, simplistic, and militaristic. Acheson overruled Kennan and Bohlen, endorsing the assumption of Soviet menace <b>implied</b> <b>by</b> NSC-68.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{physical}} properties of astatine have been estimated (by interpolation or extrapolation), using theoretically or empirically derived methods. For example, halogens get darker with increasing atomic weight– fluorine is nearly colorless, chlorine is yellow-green, bromine is red-brown, and iodine is dark gray/violet. Astatine is sometimes described as probably being a black solid (assuming it follows this trend), or as having a metallic appearance (if it is a metalloid or a metal). The melting and boiling points of astatine are also expected to follow the trend seen in the halogen series, increasing with atomic number. On this basis they {{are estimated to be}} , respectively. Some experimental evidence suggests astatine may have lower melting and boiling points than those <b>implied</b> <b>by</b> the halogen trend. Astatine sublimes less readily than does iodine, having a lower vapor pressure. Even so, half of a given quantity of astatine will vaporize in approximately an hour if put on a clean glass surface at room temperature. The absorption spectrum of astatine in the middle ultraviolet region has lines at 224.401 and 216.225nm, suggestive of 6p to 7s transitions.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of bold skin markings {{does not in}} itself prove that an animal relies on camouflage, as that depends on its behaviour. For example, although giraffes have a high contrast pattern that could be disruptive coloration, the adults are extremely conspicuous when in the open. Some authors have argued that adult giraffes are cryptic, since when standing among trees and bushes they are hard to see at even a few metres' distance. However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves, even from lions, rather than on camouflage. A different explanation is <b>implied</b> <b>by</b> the fact that young giraffes are far more vulnerable to predation than adults: {{more than half of}} all giraffe calves die within a year, and giraffe mothers hide their calves, which spend much of the time lying down in cover while their mothers are away feeding. Since the {{presence of}} a mother nearby does not affect survival, it is argued that young giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged; this is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited.|$|E
