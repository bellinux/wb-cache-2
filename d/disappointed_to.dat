5|$|Gröning {{wanted to}} join an elite army unit and {{set his sights on}} joining the Schutzstaffel. Without his father's knowledge, he did so in 1940 at a hotel where the SS was recruiting. Gröning says his father was <b>disappointed</b> <b>to</b> learn this when he came home after having joined.|$|E
5|$|In June 2012 Chapman was not {{included}} in the final 18–player Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics. She had made the 35–player longlist but was hurt and <b>disappointed</b> <b>to</b> be overlooked for the event in her home city. Chapman felt that her decision to withdraw from the England squad had caused Hope Powell – who managed Great Britain as well as England – to leave her out.|$|E
5|$|Robertson's {{men took}} many Turkish prisoners, {{including}} a senior officer of engineers {{who insisted that}} he would only surrender his sword to the Australian officer in charge. He was <b>disappointed</b> <b>to</b> discover that it was Robertson, a youthful major, but handed it over anyway.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>disappointing</b> <b>to</b> {{find that}} her father had heard nothing from my Lady about the {{settlement}} of the Manor House.|$|R

5|$|In {{the second}} half, each team scored onefield goal and one touchdown, {{although}} Texas missed their extra point so {{they won the}} game 51–10. UT's Jamaal Charles ran for 189yards and three touchdowns on 16carries in his first start for the Longhorns. After the game, Charles said that {{his goal was to}} rush for 200yards each game but that he was not <b>disappointed</b> <b>to</b> fall short of 200yards rushing because he hit his goal of rushing for threetouchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{opted for}} a 4–4–2 formation, with the only change from their FA Cup winning team four days earlier being the {{inclusion}} of Gary McAllister {{at the expense of}} Vladimír Šmicer. Robbie Fowler who had been <b>disappointed</b> <b>to</b> be a substitute for the FA Cup final was again on the bench. Emile Heskey and Michael Owen were picked to spearhead Liverpool's attack. Alavés opted to play a 5–3–2 formation, with Cosmin Contra, Dan Eggen, Antonio Karmona, Óscar Téllez and Delfí Geli in defence. In attack, Martín Astudillo and Jordi Cruyff were chosen to play behind lone striker Javi Moreno.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Daley and all law {{enforcement}} officials who had been deposed {{were excluded from the}} report. Also, the 75 credible abuse cases were overlooked; the report focused on doubts about the torture of the four pardoned death row inmates. Among the final costs were $6.2 million for the investigation and $7 million to hire outside counsel for Burge and his cohort. Many activists were <b>disappointed</b> <b>to</b> learn that the statute of limitations meant that Burge would not be prosecuted for torture. Debates in the op-ed pages continued for days. Egan explained his report to the public with legal theories and federal jurisdiction issues.|$|E
40|$|The {{expected}} {{path and}} brightness development of Halley's comet soon {{before and after}} its perihelion on February 9, 1986 are described. It is concluded that the comet will prove <b>disappointing</b> <b>to</b> most U. S. observers, since it {{is not expected to}} equal Kohoutek in peak magnitude (and since this latter comet was <b>disappointing</b> <b>to</b> the general public). Moreover, Halley's comet will be brightest (3 rd magnitude) in the southern hemisphere, and increased outdoor lighting by the year 1986 will probably obscure its tail near cities...|$|R
5000|$|On Lucas Oil letterhead, Forrest Lucas {{published}} a newspaper advertisement apologizing for his wife's remarks, writing [...] "Her words were hurtful <b>to</b> many and <b>disappointing</b> <b>to</b> all." ...|$|R
50|$|The 2009 {{season was}} <b>disappointing</b> <b>to</b> Fox and the Panthers much like 2006. The Panthers {{finished}} the season 8-8 and {{in third place}} in the NFC South division, missing the playoffs again.|$|R
5|$|On 30 March 1945, {{the daily}} comic strip Rikki en Wiske started {{to appear in}} the {{newspaper}} De Nieuwe Standaard, after a positive review by the young illustrator Marc Sleen. It was an immediate success, and the first story ran uninterrupted until 15 December 1945. Vandersteen though was <b>disappointed</b> <b>to</b> see the editor had renamed the strip Rikki en Wiske instead of his suggestion Suske en Wiske, and also felt that Rikki too closely resembled Tintin.|$|E
5|$|At {{the launch}} of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq to hunt for Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It {{was a far cry from}} the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But it would not be a replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were <b>disappointed</b> <b>to</b> play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the Iraqi security forces.|$|E
5|$|Henry and Anne {{formally}} {{married on}} 25 January 1533, after a secret wedding on 14 November 1532. On 23 May 1533, newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine's marriage null and void; five days later, he declared Henry and Anne's marriage valid. Shortly afterwards, the Pope decreed sentences of excommunication against Henry and Cranmer. As {{a result of}} this marriage and these excommunications, the first break between the Church of England and Rome took place and the Church of England was brought under the King's control. Anne was crowned Queen of England on 1 June 1533. On 7 September, she gave birth to the future Queen Elizabeth I. Henry was <b>disappointed</b> <b>to</b> have a daughter rather than a son but hoped a son would follow and professed to love Elizabeth. Anne subsequently had three miscarriages, and by March 1536, Henry was courting Jane Seymour. In order to marry Jane Seymour, Henry had to find reasons for his marriage with Anne to end.|$|E
50|$|The Compromise {{was deeply}} <b>disappointing</b> <b>to</b> African-Americans {{in both the}} North and South. It stopped the {{southern}} progression of gradual emancipation at Missouri's southern border and legitimized slavery as a southern institution.|$|R
5000|$|Lawrimore's {{response}} was to say, [...] "It’s <b>disappointing</b> <b>to</b> us if he failed to use this position to the fullest extent in advocating for policies he thought were {{in the best interests}} of the nation." ...|$|R

5|$|In 1919, {{at the age}} of thirteen, he {{was allowed}} to enter the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who {{monitored}} Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him. Shostakovich studied piano with Leonid Nikolayev after a year in the class of Elena Rozanova, composition with Maximilian Steinberg, and counterpoint and fugue with Nikolay Sokolov, with whom he became friends. Shostakovich also attended Alexander Ossovsky's history of music classes. Steinberg tried to guide Shostakovich {{in the path of the}} great Russian composers, but was <b>disappointed</b> <b>to</b> see him 'wasting' his talent and imitating Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev. Shostakovich also suffered for his perceived lack of political zeal, and initially failed his exam in Marxist methodology in 1926. His first major musical achievement was the First Symphony (premiered 1926), written as his graduation piece {{at the age of}} nineteen.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a request from the New Zealand government, Barrowclough was nominated by Freyberg for command of the Pacific Section of 2NZEF, which was based in Fiji. With the entry of Imperial Japan into the war, this was an important command as Fiji was {{the last line of}} defence for mainland New Zealand. Barrowclough embarked for New Zealand in early 1942 but during his transit, the commanding officer of the Pacific Section became seriously ill and was invalided home to be immediately replaced by Major General Owen Mead. On Barrowclough's arrival in New Zealand, he was <b>disappointed</b> <b>to</b> find that his expected command was no longer available. He was eventually posted as the commander of the Northern Division with the rank of major general. He was responsible for the defence of the upper North Island, and {{for the next few months}} oversaw the reorganisation and training of his new command.|$|E
5|$|The Timberlake {{party had}} {{decided to make the}} return trip overland, having {{purchased}} horses from the Cherokee. Ostenaco, accompanied by several hundred Cherokee warriors, guided the Timberlake group northward across what is now known as the Great Indian Warpath, which follows the western base of the Appalachian Mountains. On March 11, the party arrived at the abandoned village of Elajoy along Little River in what is now Maryville, Tennessee, and crossed the French Broad River the following day. A week later, they reached Fort Robinson, which the Stephen garrison had abandoned but stashed a large supply of flour. The expedition left Long Island on March 22, continuing northward to an army camp where Timberlake had left some belongings. He was deeply <b>disappointed</b> <b>to</b> find the trunk had been looted and most of his goods had been stolen. The party finally reached Williamsburg, Virginia in early April.|$|E
5000|$|Over time, the Kuku-Yalanji {{found other}} sites of more use. The mission {{superintendent}} Carl Meyer lamented that [...] "it is painful and <b>disappointing</b> <b>to</b> be continually revealing the gospel message {{and find it}} meeting deaf ears everywhere".|$|R
50|$|The film {{received}} <b>disappointing</b> <b>to</b> negative {{reviews from}} movie critics, although some praised it, notably Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times, {{who gave the}} film 3 out of 4 stars. The film had scored a 33% on rotten tomatoes.|$|R
5000|$|Messinger {{continued}} with [...] "I regarded this woman as a sister {{for the years}} I have known her. This revelation is shocking and <b>disappointing</b> <b>to</b> {{all of us who}} knew her and loved her, and counted her as a trusted friend." ...|$|R
5|$|Whilst {{reading for}} a maths {{scholarship}} at the University of Marburg, Shaw Jeffrey {{was offered the}} chance to work at Trent College, unofficially, as first the headmaster's private secretary, and then as a teacher. Unfortunately, he was unable to win the Marburg scholarship in 1881, and, left unemployed after the death of the Headmaster the year after, he took up a post as a junior master at Emanuel School, Wandsworth, soon after its move to new premises. On 30 January 1884, he matriculated into the University of Oxford as a member of The Queen's College, where he completed a Bachelor of Arts in 1887 and was granted his MA in 1890. He was <b>disappointed</b> <b>to</b> receive a degree with only third-class honours, however, and was advised to put any ambition of teaching on hold—advice which he did not follow.|$|E
5|$|After {{a year in}} London, Kempelen and the Turk {{travelled}} to Leipzig, {{stopping in}} various European cities along the way. From Leipzig, it went to Dresden, where Joseph Friedrich Freiherr von Racknitz viewed the Turk and published his findings in Über den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung, along with illustrations showing his beliefs about how the machine operated. It then moved to Amsterdam, after which Kempelen {{is said to have}} accepted an invitation to the Sanssouci palace in Potsdam of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia. The story goes that Frederick enjoyed the Turk so much that he paid a large sum of money to Kempelen in exchange for the Turk's secrets. Frederick never gave the secret away, but was reportedly <b>disappointed</b> <b>to</b> learn how the machine worked. (This story is almost certainly apocryphal; {{there is no evidence of}} the Turk's encounter with Frederick, the first mention of which comes in the early 19th century, by which time the Turk was also incorrectly said to have played against George III of England.) It seems most likely that the machine stayed dormant at Schönbrunn Palace for over two decades, although Kempelen attempted unsuccessfully to sell it in his final years. Kempelen died at the age of 70 on 26 March 1804.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these visual cues were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade wondered whether the simplified environment was an aesthetic choice or the result of efforts to save on development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was <b>disappointed</b> <b>to</b> see an option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise short game about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may stake out a building at a distance, the experimentation in Deus Ex Go is limited to finding the right answer rather than finding multiple routes to solve the same problem.|$|E
6000|$|... 2. Stevenson says, [...] "The {{one rule}} {{is to be}} {{infinitely}} various; <b>to</b> interest, <b>to</b> <b>disappoint,</b> <b>to</b> surprise and still to gratify; to be ever changing, as it were, the stitch, and yet still to give the effect of ingenious neatness." ...|$|R
50|$|It was {{a season}} of mixed results, with the team only winning 14 of a {{possible}} 46 league games. This saw Boston finish in a comfortable 16th position, but this was <b>disappointing</b> <b>to</b> the fans, considering what many had predicted in August.|$|R
5000|$|Rebels coach Damien Hill said, [...] "Nick {{has played}} a major part in laying the {{foundations}} of this Club and it is <b>disappointing</b> <b>to</b> see him leave. He replicates our team ethos in everything he does, {{both on and off}} the rugby field." ...|$|R
5|$|As Hayes {{prepared}} to leave office, several delegations of reform-minded Republicans urged him to run against the incumbent Republican, John Sherman, for United States Senate. Hayes declined the offers, preferring to preserve party unity and retire to private life. Hayes especially looked forward to spending time with his children, two of whom (daughter Fanny and son Scott) {{had been born in}} the past five years. Initially, Hayes tried to promote railway extensions to his hometown, Fremont. He also managed some real estate he had acquired in Duluth, Minnesota. Not entirely removed from politics, Hayes held out some hope of a cabinet appointment, but was <b>disappointed</b> <b>to</b> receive only an appointment as assistant U.S. treasurer at Cincinnati, which he turned down. He agreed to be nominated for his old House seat in 1872 but was not disappointed when he lost the election to Henry B. Banning, a fellow Kenyon College alumnus. In 1873, Lucy gave birth to another son, Manning Force Hayes. That same year, the Panic of 1873 hurt business prospects across the nation, including Hayes's. Sardis Birchard died that year and the Hayes family moved into Spiegel Grove, the grand house Birchard had built with them in mind.|$|E
5|$|As Syzygy and Nutting {{prepared}} for the MOA show, Bushnell learned that another pair of engineers were also creating an arcade version of Spacewar. In August 1971 Bushnell called Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck, operating as Mini-Computer Applications, {{so that they could}} meet and discuss their solutions to the problem of running Spacewar on an inexpensive computer. Pitts and Tuck were developing a prototype machine of Galaxy Game when they met with Bushnell; the game, however, while a faithful recreation of Spacewar, ran on an externally-connected DEC PDP-11 with a Hewlett-Packard 1300A Electrostatic Display, and the total cost of the prototype unit was US$20,000. The Syzygy duo were relieved, though also somewhat <b>disappointed,</b> <b>to</b> find that Galaxy Game was not using an innovative solution Syzygy had missed to build an economically-competitive arcade game. Pitts and Tuck, conversely, felt that Computer Space was a pale imitation of Spacewar, while Galaxy Game was a superior adaptation of the game. They eventually produced two game prototypes, both displayed in the Stanford student union building, but never produced the game commercially due to the high cost of the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell {{had also}} played Spacewar during the 1960s {{and wanted to}} make an arcade game version of it, but had gone in a {{different}} technological direction. He and Ted Dabney had initially started with a US$4,000 Data General Nova computer which they thought would be powerful enough to run multiple simultaneous games of Spacewar; when {{it turned out to}} not be, they had started investigating replacing the computer hardware with custom-built parts. They had soon discovered that while a general-purpose computer cheap enough for an arcade game would not be powerful enough to run enough games of Spacewar to be profitable, a computer purpose-built for solely running one game could be made for as low as US$100. By August 1971 when Bushnell called Tuck and Pitts, he and Dabney had already displayed a prototype of their Computer Space game in a bar near Stanford and had found a commercial manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. They were curious about what Tuck and Pitts had done to make a commercially competitive version of the game, but were relieved, though also somewhat <b>disappointed,</b> <b>to</b> find that they had not solved that problem yet.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{relatively}} high-profile exposure on TV programmes such as Channel 4's The Tube, {{the single}} {{failed to make}} any significant impression on the UK Singles Chart. This proved particularly <b>disappointing</b> <b>to</b> Lemmy, who at live shows regularly made joking references about its lack of sales.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the final}} sales numbers were <b>disappointing</b> <b>to</b> both EA and Epic Games, {{the game has}} {{garnered}} a cult following {{in the years after}} its release. Video game podcast site RageSelect declared it [...] "One of the most underappreciated games of the last five years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's very <b>disappointing</b> <b>to</b> {{have them}} do it, though," [...] said the artist, lightly. [...] "I {{thought there was}} a society to abolish poverty. That doesn't seem to be so active as the {{charities}} this winter. Is it possible they've found it a failure?" ...|$|R
