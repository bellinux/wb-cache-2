50|$|Frozen {{mirror image}} method (or method of frozen images) is an {{extension}} of the method of images for magnet-superconductor systems that has been introduced by Alexander Kordyuk in 1998 {{to take into account the}} magnetic flux pinning phenomenon. The method gives a simple representation of the magnetic field distribution generated by a magnet (a system of magnets) outside an infinitely flat surface of a perfectly hard (with infinite pinning force) type-II superconductor in more general field cooled (FC) case, i.e. when the superconductor goes into superconducting state been already exposed to the magnetic field. The difference from the mirror image method, which deals with a perfect type-I superconductor (that completely expels the magnetic field, see the Meissner effect), is that the perfectly <b>hard</b> <b>superconductor</b> screens the variation of the external magnetic field rather than the field itself.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the {{temperature}} {{distribution in the}} critical state of <b>hard</b> <b>superconductors</b> is investigated in the quasi-stationary approximation. It is shown that the temperature profile can be essentially inhomogeneous in the sample, which affects the conditions of initiation of a magnetic flux jumps. Key words: Critical state, flux flow, flux jump, instability. While dealing with instabilities of the critical state in <b>hard</b> <b>superconductors,</b> {{the character of the}} temperature distribution T(x, t) and that of the electromagnetic field E(x, t) are of substantial practical interest [1]. This derives from the fact that thermal and magnetic destractions of the critical state caused by Joule self-heating are defined by the initial temperature and electromagnetic field distributions. Hence, the form of the temperature profile may noticeably influence the criteria of critical-state stability with respect to jumps in the magnetic flux in a superconductor. Earlier (cf., e. g., [2]), in dealing with this problem, it was usually assumed that the spatial distribution of temperature and field were either homogeneous or slightly inhomogeneous.

Self-similar flux distributions with sharp square-root fronts are found. The fronts are shown to expand with power law time-dependence.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter [© Institute of Physics]. It is available at: [URL] heat and magnetization measurements on the <b>hard</b> <b>superconductor</b> HfV 2 confirm the presence of a structural phase transformation at 117 K and a superconducting transition temperature of 9 K. Above 117 K the compound has the cubic Laves phase C 15 structure. High-resolution neutron powder diffraction measurements reveal that below 117 K there is a mixed phase structure consisting predominantly of an orthorhombic component together with a cubic untransformed part. Both of these phases superconduct and their critical temperatures are similar, if not identical. In the normal state the magnetic properties are consistent with those expected for a Pauli paramagnet in which the Fermi level lies just below a high peak in the density of states. These conclusions are supported by band-structure calculations carried out using the linear muffin-tin orbital (LMTO) approximation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{comparison}} of the history effects in weakly pinned single crystals of a high Tc YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 −δ (for H ‖ c) and a low Tc Ca 3 Rh 4 Sn 13, which show anomalous variations in critical current density Jc(H) are presented via tracings of the minor magnetization hysteresis loops using a vibrating sample magnetometer. The sample histories focussed are, (i) the field cooled (FC), (ii) the zero field cooled (ZFC) and (iii) an isothermal reversal of field from the normal state. An understanding of the results {{in terms of the}} modulation in the plastic deformation of the elastic vortex solid and supercooling across order-disorder transition is sought. The critical current density Jc(H) of a <b>hard</b> <b>superconductor</b> does not display any path dependence in field (H) and it decays monotonically with increase in H. Its magnetic response is well described by the prescriptions of the celebrated critical state model. An isothermal magnetization hysteresis (M-H) loop of a strongly pinned superconductor defines an envelope within which lie magnetization values measured along all paths. However, an anomalous magnetization maximum in Jc(H), which relates either to the second magnetization peak (SMP) and/or to the peak effect (PE) phenomenon, occurs ubiquitously in weakly pinned samples of low Tc and high Tc superconductors. Ever since Jc(H) data were looked at carefully in a clean single crystal of Nb [1], it became evident that Jc(H) depends on the history of a given H. Early transport data of Steingart et al. [1] in Nb reveale...|$|E

An external magnetic field is shielded in the Meissner phase (H < Hc1) {{in the same way}} than in a soft superconductor. In the Shubnikov phase (Hc1 < H < Hc2), the critical current flows below the surface within a depth necessary to reduce the field in the inside of the superconductor to Hc1.|$|R

40|$|We show that, {{based on}} the {{critical}} state model for flux-line pinning in <b>hard</b> <b>superconductors,</b> one can assess the magnetic moment relaxation induced by the oscillations of a perpendicular magnetic field. Our theory follows a recent proposal of using phenomenological 2 D modeling for the description of crossed field dynamics in high-T_c superconductors [arXiv:cond-mat/ 0703330]. Stationary regimes with either saturation to metastable configurations, or complete decay to the thermodynamic equilibrium are obtained.

40|$|A {{theory of}} the macroturbulent {{instability}} in the system containing vortices of opposite directions (vortices and antivortices) in <b>hard</b> <b>superconductors</b> is proposed. The origin of the instability is connected with the anisotropy of the current capability in the sample plane. The anisotropy results in the appearance of tangential discontinuity of the hydrodynamic velocity of vortex and antivortex motion {{near the front of}} magnetization reversal. As is known from the classical hydrodynamics of viscous fluids, this leads to the turbulization of flow. The examination is performed {{on the basis of the}} anisotropic power-law current-voltage characteristics. The dispersion equation for the dependence of the instability increment on the wave number of perturbation is obtained, solved, and analyzed analytically and numerically.

40|$|Critical state {{problems}} which incorporate {{more than one}} component for the magnetization vector of <b>hard</b> <b>superconductors</b> are investigated. The theory {{is based on the}} minimization of a cost functional C[H⃗(x⃗) ] which weighs the changes of the magnetic field vector within the sample. We show that Bean's simplest prescription of choosing the correct sign for the critical current density J_c in one dimensional problems is just a particular case of finding the components of the vector J⃗_c. J⃗_c is determined by minimizing C under the constraint J⃗∈Δ (H⃗,x⃗), with Δ a bounded set. Upon the selection of different sets Δ we discuss existing crossed field measurements and predict new observable features. It is shown that a complex behavior in the magnetization curves may be controlled by a single external parameter, i. e. : the maximum value of the applied magnetic field H_m.

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{classical}} theory for supercooling across first order phase transitions {{to the case}} when both density and temperature are control variables. The observable region of metastability then depends on the path followed in this space of two variables. Since the density of vortex matter in superconductors can be easily varied {{over a wide range}} by varying applied field, it is ideal for experimental tests. We found, in our studies on the `peak effect' in the mixed state of superconducting CeRu$_ 2 $, supercooled states whose observable region of metastability depends on the path followed in (H,T) space, consistent with our predictions. We also discuss phenomena in <b>hard</b> <b>superconductors</b> that are well understood within Bean's critical state model.
