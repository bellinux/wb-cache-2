5|$|A recent calm period, {{with almost}} no {{earthquake}} or magmatic activity at Hualālai, has seen the growth of homes, businesses, and resorts on the mountain's flanks. The most recent major activity at the volcano was in 1929, when an intense earthquake swarm rocked Hualālai, most likely caused by magmatic action near the volcano's peak. Although it has been relatively placid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> <b>past,</b> Hualālai is still potentially active, {{and is expected to}} erupt again within the next 100years.|$|E
5|$|Several {{subspecies}} of the goldcrest {{have been}} described.

At the genetic level, the two Central Asian forms, R. r. sikkimensis and R. r. himalayensis, {{are very close to}} each other, and have differentiated only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> <b>past,</b> but they diverged from the western subspecies around 2.8mya.|$|E

5|$|In May 2010, a new {{taxonomy}} of the Bivalvia {{was published in}} the journal Malacologia. In compiling this, the authors used a variety of phylogenetic information including molecular analysis, anatomical analysis, shell morphology and shell microstructure as well as bio-geographic, paleobiogeographic and stratigraphic information. In this classification 324 families are recognized as valid, 214 of which are known exclusively from fossils and 110 of which occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> <b>past,</b> with or without a fossil record. This classification has since been adopted by WoRMS.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its mass and modeled geochemistry, researchers have also examined Enceladus's shape to determine if it is differentiated. Porco et al. (2006) used limb measurements to determine that its shape, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, is consistent with an undifferentiated interior, in contradiction to the geological and geochemical evidence. However, the current shape also supports the possibility that Enceladus is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, and may have rotated faster at some point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> <b>past</b> (with a differentiated interior). Gravity measurements by Cassini show that {{the density of the}} core is low, indicating that the core contains water in {{addition to}} silicates.|$|E
5|$|Since Norfolk {{contains}} the {{central business district}} of Hampton Roads, {{most of the major}} spectator sports are located there.

Hampton Roads is the second largest metropolitan area in the United States without a club in a major professional sports league, after the Austin metropolitan area.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} many known cases of {{population}} bottleneck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> <b>past.</b> Prior {{to the arrival of}} Europeans, North American prairies were habitat for millions of greater prairie chickens. In Illinois alone, their numbers plummeted from about 100 million birds in 1900 to about 50 birds in the 1990s. The declines in population resulted from hunting and habitat destruction, but the random consequence has been a loss of most of the species' genetic diversity. DNA analysis comparing birds from the mid century to birds in the 1990s documents a steep decline in the genetic variation in just in the latter few decades. Currently the greater prairie chicken is experiencing low reproductive success. However, bottleneck and genetic drift can lead to a genetic loss that increases fitness as seen in Ehrlichia.|$|E
