5|$|In United States v. Hamilton (1883), the Court reaffirmed {{its earlier}} {{holdings}} that certificates could not <b>issue</b> <b>from</b> motions to quash an indictment. And, in United States v. Rosenburgh (1868) and United States v. Avery (1871), the Court {{held that a}} motion to quash an indictment could not be so certified, even if the motion called into question {{the jurisdiction of the}} circuit court.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the UK's most {{disastrous}} SPAD ever {{occurred at}} Harrow and Wealdstone, in which No. 46242 City of Glasgow was severely damaged. The {{lack of an}} ATC system on most of Britain's railways was at last seen as an urgent <b>issue.</b> <b>From</b> 1956 the BR-designed Automatic Warning System (AWS) was installed. It was similar to ATC but relied on an induced magnetic field rather than an electric current and featured a visual indicator in the cab. The receiving system was installed on the Coronation class locomotives from 1959 onwards. The outward evidence of on-board AWS comprised a protective shield behind the front screw coupling, a box to house the necessary batteries immediately {{in front of the}} cab on the right-hand side and a cylindrical vacuum reservoir above the right-hand running plate.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt {{had been}} {{surprised}} by {{the outcome of the}} Republican convention, having expected to oppose a conservative isolationist. The polls showed Willkie behind by only six points, and the president expected this to be a more difficult race than he had faced in his defeats of Hoover and Landon. Roosevelt felt that Willkie's nomination would remove the war <b>issue</b> <b>from</b> the campaign. Roosevelt was nominated by the Democratic convention in Chicago in July, though he stated that because of the world crisis, he would not actively campaign, leaving that to surrogates. The fact that both major-party presidential candidates favored intervention frustrated isolationists, who considered wooing Charles Lindbergh as a third party candidate.|$|E

50|$|Although {{created in}} 1953, Richie didn't {{have his own}} title until 1960. Once he did, however, he quickly became Harvey's most popular character, {{eventually}} starring in over fifty separate titles. The flagship, Richie Rich, ran 254 <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> 1960 to 1991 (with a hiatus from 1982-1986), followed by a second volume which ran an additional 28 <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> 1991-1994. Other long-running titles were Richie Rich Millions (113 <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> 1961-1982), Richie Rich Dollars and Cents (109 <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> 1963-1982), and Richie Rich Success Stories (105 <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> 1964-1982). (Harvey ceased publishing in 1982, but started up again in 1986 under new ownership; this hiatus resulted in the cancellation of many titles.) Richie (along {{with many of the}} Harvey characters) have been published only sporadically since 1994.|$|R

5|$|Russell replaces Mill's {{analysis}} with {{an examination of}} the <b>issue</b> <b>from</b> four perspectives: the perspective of the governor, the citizen, the innovator, and the philosopher. The rational governor is always threatened by revolutionary activities, and can always be expected to ban speech which calls for assassination. Yet the governor would be advised to allow freedom of speech to prevent and diminish discontent among the subjects, and has no reason to suppress ideas which are unrelated to his governance, for instance the Copernican doctrine of heliocentrism. Relatedly, the citizen mainly understands free speech {{as an extension of the}} right to do peaceably that which could only otherwise be done through violence (Russell 1938:179–182).|$|E
5|$|The Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar or Cincinnati Music Center half {{dollar is}} a {{commemorative}} 50-cent piece {{struck by the}} United States Bureau of the Mint in 1936. Produced with the stated purpose of commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of Cincinnati, Ohio as a center of music, it was conceived by Thomas G. Melish, a coin enthusiast who controlled the group which was allowed to buy the entire <b>issue</b> <b>from</b> the government, and who resold the pieces at high prices.|$|E
5|$|The emu is popularly but unofficially {{considered}} as a faunal emblem – the national bird of Australia. It appears as a shield bearer on the Coat of arms of Australia with the red kangaroo, and {{as a part of}} the Arms also appears on the Australian 50 cent coin. It has featured on numerous Australian postage stamps, including a pre-federation New South Wales 100th Anniversary <b>issue</b> <b>from</b> 1888, which featured a 2 pence blue emu stamp, a 36 cent stamp released in 1986, and a $1.35 stamp released in 1994. The hats of the Australian Light Horse are decorated with emu feather plumes.|$|E
50|$|Though {{the pile}} <b>issues</b> <b>from</b> the chief (upper edge) by default, {{it may be}} {{specified}} as <b>issuing</b> <b>from</b> {{any other part of}} the edge or as extending from edge to edge of the shield.

5|$|The {{congregation}} {{was heavily}} involved in World WarII, with many members serving in the armed forces, including Dudley Weinberg, who had succeeded Cohn as assistant rabbi. Children of Israel published a special newsletter for overseas members; {{by the end of}} the war, approximately four hundred congregants had served—and fourteen had died—in the U.S. military. As with many other Reform congregations, the members of Temple Israel were split on the issue of Zionism. It is likely that a majority were anti-Zionist, and the synagogue president joined the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism, though other prominent members supported Zionism, and still others were simply non-Zionist. Ettelson initially opposed Zionism, though he did not join the council. With the growth of antisemitism inside and outside the United States, his views changed, and he was an early member of the local chapter of the Zionist United Palestine Appeal. Nevertheless, he successfully kept the <b>issue</b> <b>from</b> becoming divisive at the temple.|$|E

Also, in the United States, income tax laws are often used by legislatures as policy instruments for encouraging numerous undertakings deemed socially useful — including the buying of life insurance, the funding of employee health care and pensions, the raising of children, home ownership, development of alternative energy sources and increased investment in conventional energy. Special tax provisions granted for any purpose increase complexity, irrespective of the system's flatness or lack thereof.|$|E
