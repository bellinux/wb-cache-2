25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the Internet was big news.... In {{the fall of}} 1990, there were just 313,000 {{computers}} on the Internet; by 1996, there were close to 10 million. The networking idea became politicized during the 1992 Clinton-Gore election campaign, where {{the rhetoric of the}} <b>information</b> <b>highway</b> captured the public imagination. On taking office in 1993, the new administration set in place a range of government initiatives for a National Information Infrastructure aimed at ensuring that all American citizens ultimately gain access to the new networks.|$|E

500|$|Four million {{lines of}} codes {{have been written}} to develop the {{advanced}} combat management system onboard INS Kochi. The system is designed {{so that all the}} data about the surrounding threat comes in one place, along with analysis about the kind of threat. The system also advises the commanding officer about the kind of weaponry he should use to tackle the threat. Obviously, all this happens in real-time. The Ship is equipped with sophisticated digital networks, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode based Integrated Ship Data Network (AISDN), Combat [...] Management System (CMS), Automatic Power Management System (APMS) and Auxiliary Control System (ACS). The AISDN is the <b>information</b> <b>highway</b> on which data from all the sensors and weapon ride. The CMS is used to integrate information from other platforms using indigenous data-link system, to provide Maritime Domain Awareness. The intricate power supply management is done using APMS, and remote control and monitoring of machinery is achieved through the ACS.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} studies which were {{undertaken}} jointly by Telesat and Industry Canada {{to provide an}} estimate of the market opportunities for residential multi-media services in the rural and small urban areas of Canada. This study is part of the Advanced Satcom program, a Ka-band satellite system proposal which is currently in the implementation proposal phase by the government and the Canadian space industry of which Telesat is an active member. Advanced Satcom extends the reach of terrestrial <b>information</b> <b>highways</b> to the remote and sparsely populated parts of the country in a cost-effective manner and thus provides a ubiquitous coverage of the <b>information</b> <b>highways</b> to all Canadians. Therefore, the rural and small urban markets are believed to be good opportunities for the Advanced Satcom. Although the results are primarily intended for fixed residential applications, they can also be used as input to market opportunity studies for wideband mobile applications...|$|R
