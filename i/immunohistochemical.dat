5|$|Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas {{may vary}} from {{undifferentiated}} to well-differentiated. They are often {{surrounded by a}} brisk fibrotic or desmoplastic tissue response; {{in the presence of}} extensive fibrosis, {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish well-differentiated cholangiocarcinoma from normal reactive epithelium. There is no entirely specific <b>immunohistochemical</b> stain that can distinguish malignant from benign biliary ductal tissue, although staining for cytokeratins, carcinoembryonic antigen, and mucins may aid in diagnosis. Most tumors (>90%) are adenocarcinomas.|$|E
5|$|TBR1 is {{also used}} in <b>immunohistochemical</b> {{techniques}} in neurological research. It {{has been used to}} identify layer VI developing cortical neurons as well as the prethalamic eminence, pallium, and dorsal forebrain. The presence of TBR1 in stem cells responding to telencephalon injury implicates the normal function of these cells in this region of the brain.|$|E
5|$|On microscopy, {{the tumor}} cells are {{typically}} described as small, round and blue, and rosette patterns (Homer Wright rosettes) may be seen. Homer Wright rosettes are tumor cells around the neuropil, {{not to be}} confused with pseudorosettes, which are tumor cells around a blood vessel. They are also distinct from the pseudorosettes of an ependymoma which consist of tumor cells with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)–positive processes tapering off toward a blood vessel (thus a combination of the two). A variety of <b>immunohistochemical</b> stains are used by pathologists to distinguish neuroblastomas from histological mimics, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, lymphoma and Wilms' tumor.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} {{surgical}} versus non-surgical treatments for osteochondritis dissecans is controversial. Consequently, {{the type and}} extent of surgery necessary varies based on patient age, severity of the lesion, and personal bias of the treating surgeon—entailing an exhaustive list of suggested treatments. A variety of surgical options exist {{for the treatment of}} persistently symptomatic, intact, partially detached, and completely detached OCD lesions. Post-surgery reparative cartilage is inferior to healthy hyaline cartilage in glycosaminoglycan concentration, histological, and <b>immunohistochemical</b> appearance. As a result, surgery is often avoided if non-operative treatment is viable.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of intestinal metaplasia in Barrett's esophagus represents a marker for {{the progression of}} metaplasia towards dysplasia and eventually adenocarcinoma. This factor combined with two different <b>immunohistochemical</b> expression of p53, Her2 and p16 leads to two different genetic pathways that likely progress to dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus.|$|E
25|$|At {{least one}} {{specimen}} of alvarezsaurid, from the species Shuvuuia deserti, preserved down-like, feathery, integumental structures covering the fossil. Schweitzer et al. (1999) subjected these filaments to microscopic, morphological, mass spectrometric, and <b>immunohistochemical</b> studies {{and found that}} they consisted of beta-keratin, which is the primary protein in feathers.|$|E
25|$|Antibodies against {{thymidine}} kinase {{are available for}} <b>immunohistochemical</b> detection. Staining for {{thymidine kinase}} {{was found to be}} a reliable technique for identification of patients with stage 2 breast carcinoma. The highest number of patients identified was obtained by combination of thymidine kinase and Ki-67 staining. The technique has also been validated for lung cancer, for colorectal carcinima, for lung cancer and for renal cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} eyelid tumor is called basal cell carcinoma. This tumor can grow around the eye but rarely spreads {{to other parts}} of the body. Other types of common eyelid cancers include {{squamous}} carcinoma, sebaceous carcinoma and malignant melanoma. The most common orbital malignancy is orbital lymphoma. This tumor can be diagnosed by biopsy with histopathologic and <b>immunohistochemical</b> analysis. Most patients with orbital lymphoma can be offered chemotherapy or radiation therapy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Immunohistochemical</b> studies (detecting antigens by {{exploiting}} {{the principle of}} antibodies binding specifically to antigens in biological tissues) showed that CR cells expressed GABA-A and GABA-B receptors, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, vesicular glutamate transporters, {{and a number of}} different calcium-binding proteins, such as calbindin, calretinin and parvalbumin. CR cells express several genes important in corticogenesis, such as reelin (RELN), LIS1, EMX2, and DS-CAM. CR cells selectively express p73, a member of the p53 family involved in cell death and survival.|$|E
25|$|The {{histogenesis}} of c-SCLC {{and other}} multiphasic forms {{of lung cancer}} appear to be complex and varied phenomena. In most cases of c-SCLC, genomic and <b>immunohistochemical</b> {{studies suggest that the}} morphological divergence of the separate components occurs when a SCLC-like cell is transformed into a cell with the potential to develop NSCLC variant characteristics, and not vice versa. Daughter cells of this transdifferentiated SCLC-like cell then repeatedly divide and, under both intrinsic genomic and extrinsic environmental influences, acquire additional mutations (a process known as tumor progression). The end result is that the tumor acquires specific cytologic and architectural features suggesting a mixture of SCLC and NSCLC.|$|E
25|$|Later on in 1899, Cajal {{drew the}} neurons in layer I {{of the human}} fetus at term and newborn. The cells laid closer to the pia and {{displayed}} smaller, often triangular or pyriform somata, and less complex processes that lacked the ascending branchlets and had a more superficial location than the cells Retzius previously described, The cells' different morphologies {{and the fact that}} Cajal and Retzius used different species at different developmental periods led to discussion about the definition of Cajal–Retzius cells. In fact <b>immunohistochemical</b> studies performed at advanced developmental stages in human and macaque cortex visualize cells more similar to the cells Cajal described.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of BSE {{continues}} to be a practical problem. It has an incubation period of months to years, during which no symptoms are noticed, though the pathway of converting the normal brain prion protein (PrP) into the toxic, disease-related PrPSc form has started. At present, virtually no way is known to detect PrPSc reliably except by examining post mortem brain tissue using neuropathological and <b>immunohistochemical</b> methods. Accumulation of the abnormally folded PrPSc form of PrP is a characteristic of the disease, but it is present at very low levels in easily accessible body fluids such as blood or urine. Researchers have tried to develop methods to measure PrPSc, but no methods for use in materials such as blood have been accepted fully.|$|E
500|$|There {{continues}} to be a very practical problem with diagnosis of prion diseases, including BSE and CJD. They have an incubation period of months to decades, during which there are no symptoms, even though the pathway of converting the normal brain PrP protein into the toxic, disease-related PrPSc form has started. At present, there is virtually no way to detect PrPSc reliably except by examining the brain [...] using neuropathological and <b>immunohistochemical</b> methods after death. Accumulation of the abnormally folded PrPSc [...] form of the PrP protein is a characteristic of the disease, but it is present at very low levels in easily accessible body fluids like blood or urine.

2500|$|Diagnosis of FCV is {{difficult}} without specific tests, because {{the signs are}} similar to other feline respiratory diseases, especially feline viral rhinotracheitis. [...] The presence of stomatitis may indicate FCV. [...] Specific tests include virus culture, polymerase chain reaction, and <b>immunohistochemical</b> staining.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Immunohistochemical</b> skin {{labeling}} for antibodies for the ECM1 protein as labeling {{has been}} shown to be reduced in the skin of those affected by Urbach–Wiethe disease. [...] Staining with anti-type IV collagen antibodies or anti-type VII collagen antibodies reveals bright, thick bands at the dermoepidermal junction.|$|E
2500|$|In biochemistry, {{immunostaining}} is any {{use of an}} antibody-based {{method to}} detect a specific protein in a sample. The term [...] "immunostaining" [...] was originally {{used to refer to}} the <b>immunohistochemical</b> staining of tissue sections, as first described by Albert Coons in 1941. However, immunostaining now encompasses a broad range of techniques used in histology, cell biology, and molecular biology that use antibody-based staining methods.|$|E
2500|$|Because Urbach–Wiethe {{disease is}} an {{autosomal}} recessive condition, individuals can be carriers {{of the disease}} but show no symptoms. [...] The disease is caused by loss-of-function mutations to chromosome 1 at 1q21, the extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) gene. The dermatological symptoms are caused by a buildup of a hyaline material in the dermis and the thickening of the basement membranes in the skin. Urbach–Wiethe disease is typically diagnosed by its clinical dermatological manifestations, particularly the beaded papules on the eyelids. [...] The discovery of the mutations within the ECM1 gene has allowed the use of genetic testing to confirm an initial clinical diagnosis. [...] Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and <b>immunohistochemical</b> staining may {{also be used for}} diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|Many histologic mimics of Barrett's {{esophagus}} {{are known}} (i.e. goblet cells {{occurring in the}} transitional epithelium of normal esophageal submucosal gland ducts, [...] "pseudogoblet cells" [...] in which abundant foveolar [...] type mucin simulates the acid mucin true goblet cells). [...] Assessment of relationship to submucosal glands and transitional-type epithelium with examination of multiple levels through the tissue may allow the pathologist to reliably distinguish between goblet cells of submucosal gland ducts and true Barrett's esophagus (specialized columnar metaplasia). [...] Use of the histochemical stain Alcian blue pH 2.5 is also frequently used to distinguish true intestinal-type mucins from their histologic mimics. [...] Recently, <b>immunohistochemical</b> analysis with antibodies to CDX-2 (specific for mid and hindgut intestinal derivation) has also been used to identify true intestinal-type metaplastic cells. The protein AGR2 is elevated in Barrett's esophagus {{and can be used}} as a biomarker for distinguishing Barrett epithelium from normal esophageal epithelium.|$|E
