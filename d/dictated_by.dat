This letter was <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> ALP to her son Shem, a writer, and entrusted to her other son Shaun, a postman, for delivery. The letter never reaches its intended destination, ending up in a midden heap where it is unearthed by a hen named Biddy. Chapter I.6 digresses from the narrative in order to present the main and minor characters in more detail, {{in the form of}} twelve riddles and answers.|$|E

Although this has never been studied thoroughly, it is a frequent practice in successful nonfiction texts...|$|R

It was drafted while Viswanadha was <b>dictating,</b> <b>by</b> his brother, Venkateswarlu. It was completed in 29 days fitting into exactly 999 pages. Later, {{it was published in}} 1937-38 in Andhra Patrika as a serial. Again in 1987-88, it was republished in the golden jubilee edition of the same newspaper.|$|R

The cardinals had decided as early as their first meeting on 24 July to use the Sistine Chapel for the balloting and assembly of the conclave.|$|E
5|$|Dance Dance Revolution, {{released}} in 1998, is a rhythm {{game in which}} players dance on pressure-sensitive pads in an order <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> on-screen instructions. The game was highly successful both in and outside Japan, unlike games such as GuitarFreaks, DrumMania and Beatmania, though the latter had some success in Europe. Released the same year, Enix's Bust a Groove features a similar focus on dancing but employs a more conventional input method. The game contains competitive one-on-one battles, and grants the player more freedom than typical rhythm games.|$|E

Kassandra recounts her life experiences at Troy and Colchis, how she came to balk at the gender roles <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> Trojan culture, and her inner turmoil over whether she should be serving the Goddess or Apollo.|$|E
5|$|Resistivity is {{a measure}} of how {{strongly}} a material opposes the flow of electric current. The resistivity of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal, and it gets even higher with lower temperatures, which is unusual for metals. This trend continues down to 100K, below which resistivity rapidly decreases for fresh samples. Resistivity then begins to increase with time at around 20K due to radiation damage, with the rate <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> the isotopic composition of the sample.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{is a major}} predator {{of smaller}} woodland birds, though only 10% of its hunting attacks are successful.

It also makes use of gardens in built-up areas, {{taking advantage of the}} prey found there.|$|E

The terminal will be directly connected to the A3 motorway, to the railway system, and to the Bucharest Metro system through Metro Line 6.|$|R
5|$|The {{combat system}} is turn-based instead of real-time. Gameplay is usually step-based, where player actions are {{performed}} serially {{and take a}} variable measure of in-game time to complete. Game processes (e.g., monster movement and interaction, progressive effects such as poisoning or starvation) advance based on {{the passage of time}} <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> these actions. This requires the player to learn and apply tactics as they progress in the dungeon.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of the classical Nazarov cyclization reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by Shoppe to be an intramolecular electrocyclization and is outlined below. Activation of the ketone by the acid catalyst generates a pentadienyl cation, which undergoes a thermally allowed 4π conrotatory electrocyclization as <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> the Woodward-Hoffman rules. This generates an oxyallyl cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a β-hydrogen. Subsequent tautomerization of the enolate produces the cyclopentenone product.|$|E

5|$|Umbriel may be {{differentiated}} into a rocky core {{surrounded by}} an icy mantle. If this is the case, the radius of the core (317km) is about 54% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 40% of the moon’s mass—the parameters are <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Umbriel is about 0.24GPa (2.4kbar). The current state of the icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Admittedly, Diocletian's praetorian prefects—Afranius Hannibalianus, Julius Asclepiodotus, and Aurelius Hermogenianus—aided in {{regulating}} the flow and presentation of such paperwork, but the deep legalism of Roman culture kept the workload heavy. Emperors in the forty years preceding Diocletian's reign had not managed these duties so effectively, and their output in attested rescripts is low. Diocletian, by contrast, was prodigious in his affairs: there are around 1,200 rescripts {{in his name}} still surviving, and these probably represent {{only a small portion}} of the total issue. The sharp increase in the number of edicts and rescripts produced under Diocletian's rule has been read as evidence of an ongoing effort to realign the whole Empire on terms <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> the imperial center.|$|E
5|$|After {{working and}} {{training}} in Bolton and Manchester, Holden moved to London. His early buildings were influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, {{but for most of}} his career he championed an unadorned style based on simplified forms and massing that was free of what he considered to be unnecessary decorative detailing. Holden believed strongly that architectural designs should be <b>dictated</b> <b>by</b> buildings' intended functions. After the First World War he increasingly simplified his style and his designs became pared-down and modernist, influenced by European architecture. He {{was a member of the}} Design and Industries Association and the Art Workers' Guild. He produced complete designs for his buildings including the interior design and architectural fittings.|$|E
