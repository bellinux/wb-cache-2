Clive Graham, {{who was known}} in the band as Cleve Gooham because his name was mis-spelled on a <b>hotel</b> <b>reservation</b> <b>form,</b> {{was replaced}} by Phil Chesterton. Corrigan and Graham went on to form another version of The Symbols. At the beginning of 1973, Mee left the band {{and was replaced by}} Brian Gill. The Symbols continued to play colleges, clubs and the Northern cabaret circuit, and did a summer season on the Costa Dorada, Spain. In 1973 they worked on what would probably have been a single called 'Something Crazy's Happening', written by Phil Chesterton, had the band not been overtaken by events. At the end of 1973, Clarke left to join The Rubettes and was replaced by Dave Guscott on bass. At the beginning of 1974 Milton left to join Sparrow and despite him being the last original member, attempts were made to keep the band going by Chesterton, Gill and Dave Guscott. A suitable singer could not be found, they disbanded. The other Symbols band formed by Corrigan and Graham, however, carried on working.|$|E
