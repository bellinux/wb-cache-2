They were not convinced that he was talented enough to pursue a musical career, but feeling <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> prevent him from trying, they had allowed him to go to the RCM. Nevertheless, a university education was expected of him, and in 1892 he temporarily left the RCM and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years, studying music and history.|$|E

25|$|Will Belton {{has never}} ceased {{to show his}} love for Clara, and she realises that he is worthy of her love. However, she {{believes}} that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> transfer her affection from one man to another. Only after Mrs. Askerton and Will's sister Mary Belton persuade her {{that it would be}} unjust to withhold her affection from Will can she bring herself to put aside her scruples and accept him.

25|$|In recent years, other singers such as Joan Baez have sung {{it during}} their tours. Cohen {{stated that he}} was duped into giving up the rights for the song, but was glad it happened, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> write a song that was so well-loved and to get rich for it also. After {{performing}} at a few folk festivals, {{he came to the}} attention of Columbia Records representative John H. Hammond, who signed Cohen to a record deal. Cohen's first album was Songs of Leonard Cohen (1967). He appeared on BBC TV in 1968 where he sang a duet from the album with Julie Felix.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} {{requirements of a}} National Park are {{that it should have}} great natural beauty, a high value for open-air recreation and substantial continuous extent. Further, the distribution of selected areas should as far as practicable be such {{that at least one of}} them is quickly accessible from each of the main centres of population in England and Wales. Lastly there is merit in variety and with the wide diversity of landscape which is available in England and Wales, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> confine the selection of National Parks to the more rugged areas of mountain and moorland, and to exclude other districts which, though of less outstanding grandeur and wildness, have their own distinctive beauty and a high recreational value.|$|E
25|$|In 617, Xiao Xi, a {{great-grandson}} of Emperor Xuan of Western Liang, whom Cen Wenben's grandfather Cen Shanfang had served, rose in rebellion, {{claiming to}} restore the Liang dynasty. Xiao Xi established his capital at Jiangling (江陵, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), and he summoned Cen Wenben to serve as Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng). Cen {{was in charge of}} writing the imperial edicts. In 621, when the Tang dynasty general Li Xiaogong (a nephew of Emperor Gaozu, the founding emperor of the Tang dynasty) attacked Liang and put Jiangling under siege, Cen suggested to Xiao Xi that he surrendered, and Xiao Xi did so. After Xiao Xi's surrender, however, Li Xiaogong's subordinates wanted to pillage the city. Cen persuaded Li Xiaogong that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> do so, and Li Xiaogong subsequently ordered against pillaging. As Li Xiaogong was then put in charge of the former Liang capital, he invited Cen to serve on his staff. In 623, when Emperor Gaozu sent Li Xiaogong to attack the rebel leader Fu Gongshi, Cen followed Li Xiaogong and was in charge of his military correspondences. After Li Xiaogong defeated and killed Fu Gongshi and was put in charge of Fu's capital Danyang (丹楊, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu), Cen continued to serve on Li Xiaogong's staff.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the next}} seven years he {{continued}} his research and lecture tours assisted and encouraged by his wife and children. All this came to an end on July 16, 1917, however, when Lomax was fired along with six other faculty members {{as the result of a}} political battle between Governor James E. Ferguson and the University President, Dr. R. E. Vinson. Lomax moved to Chicago to take a job selling bonds at Lee, Higginson & Co; a bond brokerage firm run by the son of his old professor Barrett Wendell. A few months later, Ferguson was impeached and the Board of Regents rescinded its dismissal of the faculty. Lomax judged that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> leave his post at Lee, Higginson & Co so soon after arriving, especially with regards to his friendship with the family of Barrett Wendell, so he remained in Chicago for eighteen months until the war ended. There he struck up a what turned out to be a lifelong friendship with Chicago poet Carl Sandburg, who frequently mentions him in his book, American Songbag (1927). In 1919, his next book, Songs of the Cattle Trail and Cow Camp, an anthology of cowboy poetry, was published by Macmillan. That year Lomax returned to Texas to be secretary of the Texas Exes, which had become financially independent of the University, so as to avoid further interference from politicians. Nevertheless, interference struck, when Ferguson, whom the law prohibited from holding office, ran his wife, Miriam A. Ferguson, as his surrogate. As governor, Mrs. Ferguson was able to pack the board of regents and oust John from his job as editor of The Alcade, which during his tenure was a 100-page long publication. Seeing how the wind was blowing, Lomax resigned his secretaryship and joined the Republic Bank of Dallas in 1925. The economic crash of 1929 presaged bad things for the bank, however.|$|E
500|$|The {{ideas of}} the Black Consciousness Movement were not {{developed}} solely by Biko, but through lengthy discussions with other black students who were rejecting white liberalism. Biko was influenced by his reading of authors like Frantz Fanon, Malcolm X, Léopold Sédar Senghor, James Cone, and Paulo Freire. The Martinique-born Fanon, in particular, has been cited as a profound influence over Biko's ideas about liberation. Biko's biographer Xolela Mangcu cautioned that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> reduce Biko's thought to an interpretation of Fanon, and {{that the impact of}} [...] "the political and intellectual history of the Eastern Cape" [...] had to be appreciated too. Additional influences on Black Consciousness were the United States-based Black Power movement, and forms of Christianity like the activist-oriented black theology.|$|E
500|$|The {{surviving}} {{members of}} Pink Floyd paid Wright tribute. Waters said [...] "it {{is hard to}} overstate the importance of his musical voice in the Pink Floyd of the '60s and '70s" [...] and was happy that they had managed to reunite for Live 8. Mason said Wright's contributions to Floyd were under-rated, and that his playing [...] "was the sound that knitted it all together", comparing his [...] "quiet one" [...] status in the band to George Harrison. Gilmour called him [...] "my musical partner and my friend", praised {{the ability of the}} two men's voices to blend, such as on [...] "Echoes". Wright's death brought Pink Floyd to a formal end, with Gilmour re-iterating that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> resume touring without him.|$|E

500|$|In 1985, Reagan {{visited a}} German {{military}} cemetery in Bitburg {{to lay a}} wreath with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. It was determined that the cemetery held the graves of forty-nine members of the Waffen-SS. Reagan issued a statement that called the Nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery as themselves [...] "victims," [...] a designation which ignited a stir over whether Reagan had equated the SS men to victims of the Holocaust; Pat Buchanan, Reagan's Director of Communications, argued {{that the president did}} not equate the SS members with the actual Holocaust, but as victims of the ideology of Nazism. Now strongly urged to cancel the visit, the president responded that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> back down on a promise he had made to Chancellor Kohl.

500|$|Sykes {{stated that}} Thin Lizzy was now [...] "more of a tribute thing" [...] and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> record new {{material}} under that name. He added {{that while the}} existing band members might record together, {{it would not be}} as Thin Lizzy. In 2007, Gorham said that Lynott still received the biggest cheer of the night at concerts, and that the current Thin Lizzy was not active simply for money. [...] "We'd stop if we thought we were just going through the motions... I think that {{has a lot to do}} with the songs – if they were inferior, then maybe we would have got tired of it all. But they're not and we haven't," [...] he said. In January 2011, Gorham maintained that Lynott would have approved of the continuation of the band: [...] "He worked long hours and travelled thousands of miles to get it to a certain level. There's no way he would have said 'No-one should play those songs again.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Dyke {{believed}} it was significant that [...] "six of the largest clubs" [...] voted against BSkyB. He wrote a formal letter to Quinton which asked for the bidding process to be reopened as the network was barred from bettering BSkyB's bid. Quinton however rejected the plea and clarified the league's stance: BSkyB's bid was better [...] "...not only in money terms {{but as far as}} the potential for future income is concerned." [...] The ITV companies sought legal action, claiming a breach of obligation on behalf of Quinton and Parry. East revealed that it was only after BSkyB had won did they discover the company had submitted an improved bid: [...] "At no stage were we informed that Sky had put in another bid and nor were we given any opportunity to increase our bid in response." [...] Parry said ITV would have won broadcasting rights had they [...] "allowed us to have a pay channel in the long term and it had terrestrial coverage in the short-term." [...] The High Court refused to grant an injunction; the judge concluded the matter was [...] "a great deal more difficult than it seems at first sight" [...] and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> force the league to consider new offers. The court however found an arguable case for a breach of confidence. Soon afterwards, ITV issued a writ seeking damages against the FA and Premier League. They also submitted a separate complaint to the Office of Fair Trading to look into Murdoch's newspapers.|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} {{appearance}} in over three months on 3 May 2009, Barton was sent off late in a 3–0 loss to Liverpool at Anfield for a sliding challenge on Xabi Alonso. The red card ruled Barton out of Newcastle's remaining three matches of the season, with the club in danger of relegation from the Premier League. Newcastle manager Alan Shearer raised doubts about Barton's future at the club, saying [...] "I think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> discuss his future now, but I'm not very happy." [...] On 5 May, Newcastle United announced the suspension of Barton indefinitely, and Barton was told {{to stay away from}} the club. As a result, Barton's future at Newcastle United was put in doubt. The club suspension was widely reportedly to have resulted not directly from the red card, but from a dressing room confrontation with Shearer and assistant manager Iain Dowie following the match. Shearer said he made a mistake putting Barton back into the team, and that his tackle was [...] "a coward's tackle", to which Barton replied that he was [...] "the best player at the club", and Shearer had to play him. Shearer said that Barton was not, and that he was [...] "shit". Barton replied that Shearer was [...] "a shit manager with shit tactics". When Dowie intervened, Barton called him [...] "a prick". Barton was reportedly transfer listed, with former manager Sam Allardyce reported to have been interested in taking Barton to Blackburn Rovers. Barton's counsellor has said that Barton [...] "would love to work with Alan Shearer again" [...] and [...] "feels very much that he owes the club and the fans." ...|$|E

2500|$|A and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [...] UKHL 17, the {{majority}} of the House of Lords decided that the detention without trial under the ATCSA 2001 was discriminatory to non-British nationals, and therefore incompatible under Art.14 ECHR. A declaration of incompatibility was issued under s.4 HRA 1998. Lord Hoffmann was the only dissenting judge to hold that the whole detention without trial idea was incompatible with the right to a trial under Art.6, and that the derogation was unacceptable, because there was no [...] "threat {{to the life of the}} nation".
