5|$|Gravitational {{interactions}} of galaxies {{with each other}} and clusters cause a significant scatter in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram. The peculiar velocities associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the mass of virialized objects in the Universe. This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies (such as the Andromeda Galaxy) exhibiting blueshifts as we fall towards a common barycenter, and redshift maps of clusters showing a Fingers of God effect due to the scatter of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution. This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the mass to light ratio (the ratio of a galaxy's mass <b>in</b> <b>solar</b> masses to its brightness <b>in</b> <b>solar</b> luminosities), an important tool for measuring dark matter.|$|E

Climate modelers speculatively suggest that this reduction <b>in</b> <b>solar</b> radiation at the surface may have led to the failure of the monsoon in sub-Saharan Africa during the 1970s and 1980s, together with the associated famines such as the Sahel drought, caused by Northern hemisphere pollution cooling the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort have proved to be very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases the temperature, and, as <b>in</b> <b>solar</b> desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, Earth's {{perihelion}} occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates {{change over}} time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9% <b>in</b> <b>solar</b> energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun {{at about the same}} time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E

The basic physics of various phenomena observed in the heliosphere, resulting {{because of the presence}} of waves <b>in</b> the <b>solar</b> wind, is spelled out in some detail.

5|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), {{sometimes}} called by its DuPont name Teflon, represents 60–80% by {{mass of the}} world's fluoropolymer production. The largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for non-stick cookware. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore-Tex and used for rainwear, protective apparel, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters. Other fluoropolymers, including fluorinated ethylene propylene, mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more moldable, but also more costly and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass <b>in</b> <b>solar</b> cells.|$|E

5|$|Radioactive cosmogenic 10Be is {{produced}} in {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth by the cosmic ray spallation of oxygen. 10Be accumulates at the soil surface, where its relatively long half-life (1.36 million years) permits a long residence time before decaying to boron-10. Thus, 10Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural soil erosion, soil formation and the development of lateritic soils, and as a proxy for measurement of the variations <b>in</b> <b>solar</b> activity and the age of ice cores. The production of 10Be is inversely proportional to solar activity, because increased solar wind during periods of high solar activity decreases the flux of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form 10Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with 13C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at nuclear weapon test sites.|$|E
