25|$|The first-person {{narrator and}} protagonist, Professor Burris, is a {{university}} instructor of psychology, who is approached by {{two young men}} (one a former student) sometime in the late 1940s. The young men are recent veterans of World War II and, intrigued by utopianism, express interest in an old acquaintance of Profess Burris, named T. E. Frazier, who in the 1930s started an intentional community that still thrives. Burris contacts Frazier, who invites them all to stay for several days to experience life in the supposedly utopian community. Venturing to the community, named Walden Two, the young men bring their <b>girlfriends</b> <b>and</b> Burris brings along a colleague named Professor Castle, who teaches philosophy and ethics.|$|E
25|$|In early May 1948, Miller was loaned out again, {{this time}} to 20th Century Fox for West of Tomorrow—her first leading lady role. The {{screenplay}} was based on William Bowers' play of the same name. During WW2 in New Guinea, a US Army Air Force squadron has been assigned to protect Australia and despite having inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese, they supernaturally had none themselves. Miller played Jean Gillis, a Broadway actress and former anti-war activist, who joined the USO after her husband's death at Dunkirk. By happenstance, she ends up having to entertain the airmen by herself when she finds {{out the rest of}} her troupe is stranded. During an improvised “dinner dance,” she learns about the pilots' wives and <b>girlfriends</b> <b>and</b> their hopes for the future, but equally learns about herself. Arthur Franz makes his film debut as Miller's love interest. The next morning, all but the squadron leader and Jean are killed after an attack on the airstrip. Similar to Death Takes a Holiday (1934), the airmen reach the epiphany of their lives in the few hours they spend with Jean. The resulting film was released as Jungle Patrol (1948), the sole film that Miller had 1st-place billing. Despite Miller's preference for Bowers' original title, the film is her personal favorite.|$|E

While there, Juskalian became an editor of a monthly newspaper that was published {{with the assistance of}} a guard who owned a local printing shop.

500|$|After {{her younger}} sister Julia Lennon {{separated}} from her husband, Julia and her son, young John Lennon, moved in with a new partner, but Mimi contacted Liverpool's Social Services and complained about him sleeping {{in the same bed}} as the two adults. Julia was eventually persuaded to hand the care of Lennon over to the Smiths. Lennon lived with the Smiths for most of his childhood and remained close to his aunt, even though she was highly dismissive of his musical ambitions, his <b>girlfriends,</b> <b>and</b> wives. She often told the teenage Lennon: [...] "The guitar's all right John, but you'll never make a living out of it".|$|E
500|$|In later years, {{the tunnel}} {{has been used}} by persons who needed to exit or depart the White House without public or press attention. Tricia Nixon and her husband, Edward F. Cox, {{departed}} the White House via the tunnel after their 1972 Rose Garden wedding. According to Bill Gulley, longtime head of the White House Military Office, the tunnel was used by male White House aides to sneak their <b>girlfriends</b> <b>and</b> mistresses into the building to have sexual intercourse in the Lincoln Bedroom during the presidencies of Lyndon Johnson and [...] Jimmy Carter. Lyndon Johnson also used the tunnel to avoid Vietnam War protesters when departing the White House. An allegation that the White House to Treasury Building tunnel was used by Bill Clinton to facilitate extramarital liaisons has been discredited.|$|E
500|$|There is {{also some}} {{evidence}} that Whitman may have had sexual relationships with women. He had a romantic friendship with a New York actress, Ellen Grey, {{in the spring of}} 1862, but it is not known whether it was also sexual. He still had a photograph of her decades later, when he moved to Camden, and he called her [...] "an old sweetheart of mine". In a letter, dated August 21, 1890, he claimed, [...] "I have had six children—two are dead". This claim has never been corroborated. Toward the end of his life, he often told stories of previous <b>girlfriends</b> <b>and</b> sweethearts and denied an allegation from the New York Herald that he had [...] "never had a love affair". As Whitman biographer Jerome Loving wrote, [...] "the discussion of Whitman's sexual orientation will probably continue in spite of whatever evidence emerges." ...|$|E

500|$|In The Times on 9 December 1964, it was {{reported}} that Eliot was suing Byrne for damages of $1 million. Eliot accused Byrne of spending $150,000 for his [...] "personal comfort and benefit", over some months. The suit also accused Byrne of charging hotel bills to Seltaeb, which were as much as $19,000 every week for <b>girlfriends,</b> <b>and</b> also opening [...] "charge accounts for them in Fifth Avenue shops". Eliot also alleged that Byrne had hired a chauffeur for $700 a week and had withheld $55,000 in royalties to NEMS, after which NEMS had said they would cancel the agreement between the two companies unless monies were forthcoming. Byrne denied all the charges, but admitted he had hired a chauffeur, as he was not familiar with the streets of New York. A supreme court judge reserved his decision.|$|E
500|$|Laila is {{an ethnic}} Tajik. Born in 1978, to Hakim and Fariba, {{she is a}} {{beautiful}} and intelligent girl coming from a family in which the father is university-educated and a teacher. Hosseini states that compared to Mariam, Laila [...] "had a much more fulfilling relationship with her father, her <b>girlfriends</b> <b>and</b> her childhood friend, Tariq. She expected to finish school and is looking for personal fulfillment. These are two very different representations of women." [...] Her life becomes tied to Mariam's when she becomes the second wife of Rasheed, Mariam's husband. This originally draws resentment from Mariam, who [...] " [...] her territory infringed upon". Despite this, [...] "Laila becomes her daughter for all practical purposes" [...] due to Mariam's childlessness, struggles,and abuse they both face during the marriage. Towards {{the end of the}} novel she becomes a schoolteacher at the orphanage where Aziza had stayed.|$|E
500|$|Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad {{described}} the song's title {{as a reference}} to Karl Marx's statement that religion is the [...] "opiate of the masses." [...] Cobain said the song is about a man who, {{after the death of}} his girlfriend, turns to religion [...] "as a last resort to keep himself alive. To keep him from suicide." [...] While Cobain said the narrative of [...] "Lithium" [...] was fictional, he said, [...] "I did infuse some of my personal experiences, like breaking up with <b>girlfriends</b> <b>and</b> having bad relationships." [...] Cobain acknowledged that the song was possibly inspired in part by the time he spent living with his friend Jesse Reed and his born-again Christian parents. He explained to Azerrad, [...] "I've always felt that some people should have religion in their lives [...] That's fine. If it's going to save someone, it's okay. And the person in [...] needed it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{narrator of}} the song worries that the girl he is {{addressing}} will ignore him because {{he has nothing to}} give her; likewise, the song's audience in the 1980syoung students and workerswere also suffering from not having resources to marry, to be with their <b>girlfriends</b> <b>and</b> boyfriends, or to attract members of the opposite sex. [...] The lyrics also express Western concepts of individualism, and were some of the first popular song lyrics in China to promote self-expression and self-empowerment. This put the song in stark contrast with older music, which had emphasized conformity and obedience. As the narrator, later on in the song, confidently proclaims to the girl that he will [...] "grab her hands" [...] ("") and then she will go with him (""), he suggests in the end that she can love {{the fact that he has}} nothing (""). On one level, this suggests that the song is about [...] "love conquering all", but the line has also been interpreted as threatening, and suggestive of an unorthodox and [...] "Dionysian" [...] mix of love and aggression.|$|E
500|$|In May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas {{was married}} to 14-year-old Kasturbai Makhanji Kapadia (her first name was usually {{shortened}} to [...] "Kasturba", and affectionately to [...] "Ba") in an arranged marriage, according to the {{custom of the region}} at that time. In the process, he lost a year at school, but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies. His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, [...] "As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives." [...] However, as was prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband. Writing many years later, Mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride, [...] "even at school I used to think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me." [...] He later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when she would visit a temple with her <b>girlfriends,</b> <b>and</b> being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} 1974. The budget was $1.5 million. Pre-production lasted one week, including casting. Grittier sequences were {{shot on the}} streets of New York City, while less serious locations were shot on Warner Bros.' sound stages in Los Angeles. According to Bakshi, [...] "What I would do is dress guys up, live-action guys. Very strange dudes! The weirdest guys I could find. Having them talk to animated characters in front of candy stores, discussing <b>girlfriends</b> <b>and</b> such. It was very surrealistic." [...] Yaphet Kotto and the glam punk band New York Dolls were cast in the live action sequences, with the New York Dolls playing homosexuals. Mean Streets actors Richard Romanus and David Proval were cast as the voices of Vinnie and Crazy Shapiro. Much of the shooting of live action sequences and recording of animated dialogue involved improvisation, with Bakshi setting up the premise of the scene and allowing his actors to create their own dialogue. During the [...] "rumble" [...] sequence, the actors playing the Chaplains were filmed popping and performing styles of dance which later evolved into breakdancing, dance styles which were unheard of in the 1970s studio system.|$|E

500|$|His {{character}} was branded a [...] "rat" [...] and [...] "dastardly" [...] for splitting up Gina and Emily by the Daily Record. Upon Darren's 2003 return to Hollyoaks, the Sunday Mercury {{said he had}} become [...] "even more of {{a pain in the}} neck". They later called the character [...] "a really nasty piece of work" [...] and when he stole from his father, they questioned if Jack would [...] "see what he's really like". Inside Soaps Peter Griffiths referred to Darren as one of the serial's [...] "reliable stalwarts", saying it was a [...] "relief" [...] when he appeared and added that Darren was one of the characters who can [...] "be relied upon to deliver". He added that the [...] "tried-and-tested" [...] characters helped the show through its rough patches and that they should be given the storylines they deserved. Griffiths' colleague Sarah maintained that Darren was {{the only part of the}} show that held her interest. The Press and Journal described Darren's time on the soap, saying: [...] "He languished in prison for helping his father fake his own death, has battled a crippling gambling addiction and has been known to steal people's <b>girlfriends</b> <b>and</b> break up relationships".|$|E
500|$|Bilge Ebiri of the {{magazine}} New York said, [...] "You can't shake the feeling that in a just world, all these women– even Kate Upton– would have better material than this."

It falls into the category of Girlfriend Films– as in, go with your <b>girlfriends</b> <b>and</b> leave your date/partner/spouse at home with the PlayStation or the NBA playoffs." [...] Colin Covert of Star Tribune gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "It's an escapist women's empowerment comedy like many others, but elevated by the simple virtue of being, for most of its length, very, very funny." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "A movie as generic and forgettable as the sofa-size art on its characters' walls." [...] Linda Holmes wrote for NPR, calling the film [...] "a conceptually odious, stupid-to-the-bone enterprise ..." [...] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times advised guys to [...] "Step away from the vehicle, because The Other Woman is out of control and intent on running down a certain kind of male." ...|$|E
500|$|During the Oops!...

In February 2001, Spears signed a $7–8 million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, entitled A Mother's Gift. On the same month, Spears started to record material for her third studio album, with [...] "Anticipating" [...] being recorded at Rusk Sound Studios in Los Angeles, California, the DOJO in Jackson, New Jersey, Sound on Sound Studios and Battery Studios in New York City.

Audio engineering was done by Aaron Kaplan, Rich Tapper, Jill Tengan and Charles McCrorey. Nile Rodgers played the guitar. Bass guitar and programming was done by Kierulf. Background vocals were provided by Spears and Jennifer Karr. Her third studio album, Britney, was released in November 2001. In an interview with the Daily Record, Spears commented on the track, saying, [...] "It's just a fun song that I wrote. It's just like being with your <b>girlfriends</b> <b>and</b> just dancing. I think this track also has a very Seventies' feel to it." [...] It was released as the fourth single from the album on June 21, 2002 in France.|$|E
