5|$|As <b>intriguing</b> as {{geometric}} Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, {{is merely}} a limiting case of (special) relativistic mechanics.

(The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincaré group, which includes translations, rotations and boosts.) The {{differences between the two}} become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{sketches}} were derived almost exclusively from the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily adaptable {{to the screen}} either as raw material or creative inspiration.

He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, <b>intriguing</b> snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E

However, the game was criticized for simple and repetitive gameplay and an unsatisfying climax.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Actor Rebellion of 1733, Fielding produced a revised version of The Author's Farce, incorporating a new prologue and epilogue. Performed at the Theatre Royal, it was advertised in the Daily Journal, opening with an inferior replacement cast {{for some of the}} important characters. It was joined by The <b>Intriguing</b> Chambermaid and The Harlot's Progress. These were the only performances of the revised version, which was printed together with The <b>Intriguing</b> Chambermade (1734) and included a letter by an unknown writer, possibly Fielding himself. The 1734 edition of the play was printed in 1750, and it was used for all later publications until 1966. Printed texts of the play were included in Arthur Murphy's 1762 Works of Henry Fielding and George Saintsbury's 1893 Works of Henry Fielding. The latter includes The Author's Farce along with only two other plays. The 1903 Works of Henry Fielding, edited by G. H. Maynadier, included only the first two acts. Only three scenes were included in Alfred Howard's The Beauties of Fielding, which collected passages from Fielding's works. George Saintsbury included The Author's Farce and two other plays in a Fielding collected edition of 1893, but ignored the others.|$|E

For several days he hesitated to tell his father about this choice, but when he did, he showed support. While Tirulokchandar was writing the script, Meiyappan suggested approaching Ramachandran for the lead role. Tirulokchandar found this <b>intriguing,</b> as the script's genre was dissimilar to what Ramachandran was noted for: action-adventure or social and family dramas which portrayed him as a champion for the downtrodden.|$|E
