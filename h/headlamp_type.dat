40|$|Headlamps with high-intensity {{discharge}} (HID) {{sources have}} been available on vehicles sold in the U. S. for a little over ten years. Although estimates of the proportion of HID headlamps in the vehicle fleet can be made based on sales data, there are uncertainties in those estimates {{because of lack of}} comprehensive compilation of data, unknown retention rates in the fleet, and complex regional differences in sales. Furthermore, number of vehicles sold and/or registered is not necessarily predictive of vehicles in use because of possible differences in overall driving rates or, most importantly, in nighttime driving rates. This study was therefore designed to obtain direct measurements of the proportion of vehicles with HID headlamps in nighttime traffic. Eight sites (two in each of four metropolitan areas) were selected, and traffic at those sites was video recorded between the hours of 7 : 00 p. m. and 10 : 00 p. m. The observations were made in late February and early March 2008, when those evening hours were dark and virtually all vehicles had their headlamps on. Video recording was done with diffraction gratings mounted on the cameras so that the type of headlamps—HID or tungsten-halogen (TH) —could be easily discriminated by the spectrally dispersed headlamp images. Investigators later scored the videos, counting the numbers of vehicles (except for motorcycles) in terms of <b>headlamp</b> <b>type</b> (HID or TH), and number of headlamps on (both, one, or none). The proportions of vehicles with HID headlamps varied by more than an order of magnitude, from 0. 0151 to 0. 200, across the eight sites. The proportion of HID headlamps did not vary over time within the three-hour observation periods. The proportions of TH-equipped vehicles with one headlamp not functioning varied from 0. 0018 to 0. 0129 across the eight sites...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{the author}} {{developed}} a retroreflective sheeting selection technique for traffic signs. Previous research {{was used to}} determine the luminance needed by drivers (demand luminance). The author used roadways scenarios to determine the amount of luminance the retroreflective sheeting on a sign would produce (supply luminance). A spreadsheet was developed to determine the performance of different retroreflective sheeting types by comparing the demand and supply luminance for specific roadway scenarios. Using the results of previous studies, three demand luminance levels were created: replacement, adequate, and desirable. The replacement level represents the level of luminance when a sign needs to be replaced and is 2. 5 cd/m 2. The adequate level is the recommended amount of luminance when installing new traffic signs and is 10 cd/m 2. The desirable level is the approximate level when additional luminance has diminishing returns and is 30 cd/m 2. Supply luminance on a specific traffic sign was determined by evaluating roadway geometries, sign placement, retroreflective sheeting type and vehicle data. The author reviewed roadway geometries in Texas to estimate typical number of lanes, shoulder widths and horizontal curvature in the US. Sign placement from the MUTCD determined the typical lateral placements, sign heights, and sign twists. Vehicle data included vehicle dimensions and <b>headlamp</b> <b>type.</b> Both the supply and demand luminance were determined for a specific viewing distance for a given scenario. The viewing distance is the distance a driver needs to read or recognize a sign to respond properly. In addition, the type of sign, alphanumeric or symbol, determined how this distance was calculated. The author developed four sign groups to calculate the distance required to read and respond to a traffic sign, including 1) Stop required, 2) Reduction in speed required, 3) Read the message provided, and 4) Change of lane required. For symbol signs, the minimum required visibility distance (MRVD) was determined for the sign group and for text signs, the viewing distance at a legibility index (LI) of 30 ft/in was found. At these distances, the author calculated the supply luminance and then compared it to the demand luminance levels to determine the performance level. The author developed the Retroreflective Sheeting Selection Spreadsheet (RSSS) to allow others to use the methodology presented in this thesis. RSSS allows users to input the roadway data, vehicle data, and sign data. RSSS takes this information and looks up the supply luminance for the scenario. RSSS then compares the supply luminance to the demand luminance levels and outputs the retroreflective sheeting performance level for the scenario...|$|E
25|$|When a halogen {{headlamp}} is retrofitted with an HID bulb, light distribution and output are altered. In the United States, vehicle lighting {{that does not}} conform to FMVSS 108 is not street legal. Glare will be produced and the <b>headlamp's</b> <b>type</b> approval or certification becomes invalid with the altered light distribution, so the headlamp is no longer street-legal in some locales. In the US, suppliers, importers and vendors that offer non-compliant kits are subject to civil fines. By October 2004, the NHTSA had investigated 24 suppliers and all resulted in termination of sale or recalls.|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{information regarding the}} market-weighted prevalence of lightemitting diode (LED) light sources for exterior lighting on model year 2008 vehicles sold in the U. S. The main findings were as follows: (1) LEDs are employed to some degree for virtually all required exterior lighting functions on U. S. vehicles (high-beam headlighting is the exception, for which LEDs are expected to appear later in 2008), and (2) rear signaling and marking functions show the highest usage of these light sources. Supplemental information about <b>headlamp</b> bulb <b>types,</b> <b>headlamp</b> optics, and rear turnsignal color is also presented...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturers have {{recently}} introduced several <b>types</b> of tungsten-halogen <b>headlamp</b> bulbs {{that have been}} filtered to produce bluish tints. Some informal reports suggest that the differences in spectral power distribution due to the tinting enhance visual performance and reduce fatigue; others suggest that they simply provide esthetic benefits. In this study, we investigate the effect of three <b>headlamp</b> <b>types</b> (a standard tungsten-halogen lamp, a broadly filtered blue-tinted lamp, and a neodymium-filtered blue-tinted lamp) on two aspects of vision (discomfort glare judgments and the luminance threshold for target detection). Consistent with prior studies, {{the results show that}} discomfort glare ratings increase as chromaticity moves toward the blue range. No evidence was observed that target detection is enhanced with blue headlamps for either peripherally viewed or centrally viewed targets. However, when deeply colored light sources (beyond the range of nominal white that headlamps are required to meet) were introduced into the detection task, differences in spectral sensitivity were observed in the near-periphery...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} voltage changes on beam patterns of low-beam <b>headlamps.</b> Seven different <b>types</b> of filament lamps were tested. The voltages used were 12. 0, 12. 8 and 13. 5 V. The photometry was performed from 20 ° left to 20 ° right, and from 5 ° down to 5 ° up, all in steps of 0. 5 °. The main {{finding of this study}} is that, for all seven lamps tested, voltage changes between 12. 0 V and 13. 5 V caused light output to change by the same proportion throughout the beam pattern. Therefore, for filament lamps, it is reasonable to use a single constant for all values in a beam pattern when converting a headlighting specification at one voltage to a specification at a different voltage, at least if the voltages in question are between 12. 0 V and 13. 5 V. The constants obtained across the seven lamps tested were similar to each other. Furthermore, these constants were in general agreement with the constants derived using the standard IES formula relating light-output changes to voltage changes...|$|R

Wheel discs were fashioned in an attractive new disced design. Series 62 bodystyles were identified by non louvered rear fenders, the use of thin bright metal underscores on the bottom rear of the cars only and the decoration of both hood and deck lid with Cadillac crests and V- shaped ornaments. The Club Coupe model disappeared. Two door Series 62 were now all hardtops (including the better equipped Coupe de Ville) or convertibles. Another familiar name appeared on 1953's Series 62. The {{top of the line}} subseries Eldorado was one of three specialty convertibles produced in 1953 by General Motors, the other two being the Oldsmobile 98 Fiesta and the Buick Roadmaster Skylark. The Eldorado was a limited-edition luxury convertible, and would eventually become its own series. It featured a full assortment of deluxe accessories, including wire wheels, and introduced the wraparound windshield to Cadillac standard production. Sales set a new record at 85,446.|$|R
