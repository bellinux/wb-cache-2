5|$|Cracks are linear {{openings}} {{that form}} in materials to relieve stress. When an <b>elastic</b> <b>material</b> stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks {{meet at a}} node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress {{in the same direction}} would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.|$|E

25|$|The {{stresses}} and {{strains of the}} material inside a continuous <b>elastic</b> <b>material</b> (such as a block of rubber, {{the wall of a}} boiler, or a steel bar) are connected by a linear relationship that is mathematically similar to Hooke's spring law, and is often referred to by that name.|$|E

25|$|A hyperelastic {{material}} {{is a special}} case of a Cauchy <b>elastic</b> <b>material</b> in which the stress at any point is objective and determined only by {{the current state of}} deformation with respect to an arbitrary reference configuration (for more details on deformation see also the pages Deformation (mechanics) and Finite strain). However, the work done by the stresses may depend on the path the deformation takes. Therefore, a Cauchy <b>elastic</b> <b>material</b> has a non-conservative structure, and the stress cannot be derived from a scalar elastic potential function. The special case of Cauchy elastic materials where the work done by the stresses is independent of the path of deformation is referred to as a Green elastic or hyperelastic material. Such materials are conservative and the stresses in the material can be derived by a scalar elastic potential, more commonly known as the Strain energy density function.|$|E
25|$|Quartz clocks {{employ a}} crystal {{oscillator}} {{made from a}} quartz crystal that uses {{a combination of both}} direct and converse piezoelectricity to generate a regularly timed series of electrical pulses that is used to mark time. The quartz crystal (like any <b>elastic</b> <b>material)</b> has a precisely defined natural frequency (caused by its shape and size) at which it prefers to oscillate, and this is used to stabilize the frequency of a periodic voltage applied to the crystal.|$|E
25|$|Soft tissues {{have the}} {{potential}} to undergo big deformations and still come back to the initial configuration when unloaded, i.e. their stress-strain curve is nonlinear. The soft tissues are also viscoelastic, incompressible and usually anisotropic. Some viscoelastic properties observable in soft tissues are: relaxation, creep and hysteresis. In order to describe the mechanical response of soft tissues, several methods have been used. These methods include: hyperelastic macroscopic models based on strain energy, mathematical fits where nonlinear constitutive equations are used, and structurally based models where the response of a linear <b>elastic</b> <b>material</b> is modified by its geometric characteristics.|$|E

25|$|Hahnemann {{believed}} {{the underlying causes}} of disease were phenomena that he termed miasms, and that homeopathic preparations addressed these. The preparations are manufactured using a process of homeopathic dilution, in which a chosen substance is repeatedly diluted in alcohol or distilled water, each time with the containing vessel being bashed against an <b>elastic</b> <b>material,</b> commonly a leather-bound book. Dilution typically continues well past the point where no molecules of the original substance remain. Homeopaths select homeopathics by consulting reference books known as repertories, and by considering the totality of the patient's symptoms, personal traits, physical and psychological state, and life history.|$|E
25|$|The {{buckling}} {{strength of a}} member {{is less than the}} elastic {{buckling strength}} of a structure if the material of the member is stressed beyond the <b>elastic</b> <b>material</b> range and into the non-linear (plastic) material behavior range. When the compression load is near the buckling load, the structure will bend significantly and the material of the column will diverge from a linear stress-strain behavior. The stress-strain behavior of materials is not strictly linear even below the yield point, hence the modulus of elasticity decreases as stress increases, and significantly so as the stresses approach the material's yield strength. This reduced material rigidity reduces the buckling strength of the structure and results in a bucking load less than that predicted by the assumption of linear elastic behavior.|$|E

500|$|The {{muscles that}} control flight in insects {{can take up}} to 10% to 30% of the total body mass. The muscles that control flight vary with the two types of flight found in insects: {{indirect}} and direct. Insects that use first, indirect, have the muscles attach to the tergum instead of the wings, as the name suggests. As the muscles contract, the thoracic box becomes distorted, transferring the energy to the wing. There are two [...] "bundles" [...] of muscles, those that span parallel to the tergum, the dorsolongitudinals, and those that are attached to the tegum and extend to the sternum, the dorsoventrals. In direct muscle, the connection is directly from the pleuron (thoracic wall) to individual sclerites located {{at the base of the}} wing. The subalar and basalar muscles have ligament attachments to the subalar and basalar sclerites. Here resilin, a highly <b>elastic</b> <b>material,</b> forms the ligaments connecting flight muscles to the wing apparatus.|$|E

40|$|Elastic {{cavitation}} is {{a well-known}} physical process by which <b>elastic</b> <b>materials</b> under stress can open cavities.

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} Sneddon and Muki {{solutions}} to solve elastostatic problems in multilayered <b>elastic</b> <b>materials.</b> Using Hankel transforms, Sneddon and Muki developed general solutions of elastostatic problems in <b>elastic</b> <b>materials</b> occupying either halfspace or one layer regions. Based on the Sneddon and Muki solutions and a transfer matrix method, solutions are presented for elastostatic problems in multilayered <b>elastic</b> <b>materials</b> subject to both {{external and internal}} loading. A special technique is adopted to eliminate the ill-conditioned matrices associated with the conventional transfer matrix method for multilayered materials. The extended Sneddon and Muki solutions can be easily calculated using a personal computer. Numerical examples given in the paper show that the extended Sneddon and Muki solution generates results with high accuracy and efficiency. The extended Sneddon and Muki solution has wider applications to engineering science. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
