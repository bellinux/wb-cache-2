5|$|Following the {{rallying}} {{successes of}} the Simca 1000 and the Talbot Sunbeam, PSA launched the Samba Rallye. Fitted with the 1219cc XW version of the X engine, delivering 66kilowatt (90PS), <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> either white or red, with a hood scoop and side stripes. In 1985, a version with the 1360cc unit producing 59kilowatt (80PS) was launched, without the stripes. A special rallye-only Group B model, officially called the Peugeot Talbot Sport Samba Rallye preceded the later Peugeot 205 T16, with a 1285cc, 96kilowatt engine (130PS).|$|E

5|$|His {{first season}} with Blackburn was mixed – he missed half of it through injury after {{snapping}} his right anterior cruciate ligament in a match against Leeds United in December 1992, but scored a prolific 16 goals in the 21 games in which he did feature. Shearer also became a regular in the England team this season and scored his second international goal; <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> a 4–0 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier win over Turkey in November. The season ended sourly, however, as Shearer was forced to miss January through to May due to injury and England's World Cup qualification chances were hit by a run of poor form.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{had learned}} about Katagiri's plans {{and as a result}} the 9th Division commander, Wootten, decided to put off his own {{offensive}} plans while the Japanese attack was dealt with. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> the early hours of 17 October, and {{over the course of the}} following week heavy fighting ensued around Katika and Jivevaneng. Forewarned, the Australians were able to check these attacks with assistance from American support units, and by the time that the Japanese called off their offensive on 25 October, the Japanese 20th Division had suffered 352 men killed and 564 wounded, while the Australians had suffered 228 casualties. It was during the early stages of this fighting that an American soldier, Private Nathan Van Noy, from the 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, performed the deeds that resulted in him being posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} first hinted by an Atlus {{spokesperson}} in November 1999, who stated that Atlus was planning an {{entry in the}} Megami Tensei franchise for the platform. The game was eventually announced in September 2002 by the gaming magazine Famitsu, where it was clarified it was a sequel to previous Shin Megami Tensei games rather than an entry in the spin-off Persona series. Atlus had high hopes for Nocturnes success, preparing estimated shipments totaling 500,000 units. The game launched on February 20, 2003. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> a standard edition, and a limited special edition containing the game's soundtrack and an insence burner modeled after an in-game story component. In addition, a version exclusive to Japanese media retail shop Tsutaya with a unique cover was released. It was later re-released as part of Sony's budget series release on August 5, 2004.|$|E

5|$|On {{the opening}} day of Cowboys & Aliens, {{estimates}} showed that its opening day gross was $13.0 million and <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> second place to The Smurfs opening day gross of $13.3 million. This was considered a surprise since Cowboys & Aliens was expected to be the clear winner for the weekend. Estimates then showed Cowboys & Aliens and The Smurfs tied at the #1 spot for the weekend with $36.2 million each. However, when the actual results for the weekend were announced Cowboys & Aliens won the weekend with $36.4 million just beating out The Smurfs, which grossed $35.6 million. The film grossed $100,240,551 in the U.S. and Canada (making it the 500th $100 million domestic movie) as well as $74,581,774 internationally, bringing its worldwide total to $174,822,325. The film {{is considered to be a}} financial disappointment, narrowly grossing its budget back. In 2014, the LA Times listed the film as one of the most expensive box office flops of all time.|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} amount of public revenue created by the pipeline provoked debates {{about what to do}} with the windfall. The record $900 million created by the Prudhoe Bay oil lease sale took place at a time when the entire state budget was less than $118 million, yet the entire amount created by the sale was used up by 1975. Taxes on the pipeline and oil carried by it promised to bring even more money into state coffers. To ensure that oil revenue wasn't spent as <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>in,</b> the Alaska Legislature and governor Jay Hammond proposed the creation of an Alaska Permanent Fund—a long-term savings account for the state. This measure required a constitutional amendment, which was duly passed in November 1976. The amendment requires at least 25 percent of mineral extraction revenue to be deposited in the Permanent Fund. On February 28, 1977, the first deposit—$734,000—was put into the Permanent Fund. That deposit and subsequent ones were invested entirely in bonds, but debates quickly arose about the style of investments and what they should be used for.|$|E
5|$|When {{the stadium}} was profitable, Modell had used Stadium Corp. to buy land in Strongsville {{that he had}} {{previously}} acquired as the potential site for a future new stadium. Modell originally paid $625,000 for the land, but sold it to his own Stadium Corp. for more than $3 million. Then, when the stadium was taking losses in 1981, he sold Stadium Corp. itself to the Browns for $6 million. This led to a fight the following year with Bob Gries, whose family {{had been part of}} the Browns' ownership group since its founding and had 43% of the team to Modell's 53%. Gries's complaint was that Modell treated the Browns and Stadium Corp. as his own fiefdom, rarely consulting him about the team's business. The sale of Stadium Corp. to the Browns, he argued, enriched Modell at the team's expense. Gries's case went to the Ohio Supreme Court, where he won. In 1986, Modell had to reverse the Browns' purchase of Stadium Corp. and pay $1 million in Gries's legal fees. This left Modell in need of financial help, and <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> the form of Al Lerner, a banking and real estate executive who bought half of Stadium Corp. and 5% of the Browns in 1986.|$|E

5|$|The Phillies {{opened the}} month of August with three {{straight}} losses, but the stopper's role again fell to the rookie Happ, who pitched his second shutout of the season—and the second of his career—against the Rockies on August 5. He earned the team's 60th win of the season while allowing four hits and striking out ten batters {{for the first time}} in his career. In accordance with his 8–2 record and strong performances, Amaro announced that Happ would remain in the Phillies' starting rotation despite the team's acquisitions of Lee and Pedro Martínez; rumors regarding Happ's status had been rampant since Martínez' signing and during the trade season when Happ was rumored to be the centerpiece of a potential trade for the Blue Jays' Roy Halladay. New pitcher Lee stifled the Rockies the following day to win the series for the Phillies with a second consecutive strong performance, allowing one run over seven innings and allowing only six hits. In the following series with Florida, however, the Phillies struggled. The Marlins swept all three games of the series, which included Victorino's first career ejection on several close calls by umpire Ed Rapuano, and a crucial error by Victorino's center field replacement, Werth, in the final game of the series. Moyer pitched against the Marlins in that game, a team against which he had prior success in his career (13–3, 2.87 ERA in 100 innings pitched), and allowed two earned runs on eleven singles through five innings; however, with a rotation-high 5.47 ERA, the Phillies demoted Moyer to the bullpen to allow Martínez to start. Francisco hit his second Phillies home run against the Cubs on August 11; <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> the 12th inning and scored the game-winning run for the Phillies. It became the first win of a three-game series sweep, which Lee closed out with a third straight dominant performance (eight innings pitched, one run allowed, eight strikeouts). The Phillies took two of three games from the Braves in their next series, and completed a three-game homestand against the Diamondbacks with a complete game from Lee, who carried a no-hitter into the sixth inning, and eight innings of three-run baseball from Blanton.|$|E
