5|$|Apart from a work-up {{patrol in}} the Norwegian Sea, {{she spent the}} bulk of the war in the Mediterranean. While working up, Unrivalled fired a torpedo at what was thought to be a {{submerged}} enemy submarine. Only the periscope was sighted, and the torpedo was fired in the direction detected by the hydrophones, but no German submarine was in the area. Whilst in service in the Mediterranean, she sank a number of small merchantmen and small naval auxiliary vessels with both torpedoes and gunfire. These included the <b>Italian</b> auxiliary submarine chaser O 97 / Margherita, the <b>Italian</b> merchants Maddalena, Mostaganem and Pasubio, the <b>Italian</b> tugs Genova and Iseo, the <b>Italian</b> sailing vessels Triglav, Albina, Margherita, Sparviero and Ardito, the German auxiliary submarine chasers UJ 2201/Bois Rose and UJ 2204/Boréal, the <b>Italian</b> tanker Bivona, the small <b>Italian</b> merchant Santa Mariana Salina, the <b>Italian</b> auxiliary minesweeper R 172 / Impero and the small <b>Italian</b> vessel San Francisco di Paola A.|$|E
5|$|As {{retribution}} for the <b>Italian</b> actions at Beirut, {{four days}} after the battle the central Ottoman government ordered the Wilyets of Beirut, Aleppo, and Damascus to expel all <b>Italian</b> citizens from their jurisdictions, resulting in the deportation of over 60,000 Italians from the region. Despite the retaliatory expulsion of <b>Italian</b> citizens from the area, the battle gave the <b>Italian</b> forces complete naval superiority in the approaches to the Suez Canal and <b>Italian</b> forces in Eritrea could now be reinforced without hesitation, eliminating much of the Ottoman threat to the region. Thus the battle was both a strategic and tactical <b>Italian</b> victory.|$|E
5|$|Dmowski admired <b>Italian</b> fascism. In {{the summer}} of 1926 Dmowski wrote a series of {{articles}} admiring Mussolini and the <b>Italian</b> fascist model, and helped organize the Camp of Great Poland (OWP), a broad anti-Sanacja front modeled on <b>Italian</b> fascism that was known for its anti-Jewish rhetoric and violence. Later he nonetheless tried to ensure that OWM would not blindly imitate the <b>Italian</b> or German models.|$|E

5|$|On 3 June, the destroyers Wildfang and Csikós, {{along with}} 93F and 96F, briefly {{encountered}} three <b>Italian</b> MAS boats off {{the mouth of}} the Tagliamento river in the far north of the Adriatic.

The following night, 94F and three other torpedo boats again had a short and inconclusive engagement with <b>Italian</b> torpedo boats in the northern Adriatic. On 29 September, 90F, 94F and 98M were accompanying a squadron of four destroyers supporting an air attack on the <b>Italian</b> airfield at Ferrara by flying boats. After destroying an <b>Italian</b> airship, the squadron withdrew at high speed in the darkness, but was intercepted by an <b>Italian</b> squadron of eight destroyers that had been sent to support an <b>Italian</b> air raid on Pola.

5|$|On 3 September 1943, the Western Allies {{invaded the}} <b>Italian</b> mainland, {{following}} Italy's armistice with the Allies.

On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and France, which made <b>Italian</b> military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in <b>Italian</b> East Africa {{a danger to the}} British and French colonies in East Africa. <b>Italian</b> belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes along the coast of East Africa, the Gulf of Aden, Red Sea and the Suez Canal. (The Kingdom of Egypt remained neutral during World War II but the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 allowed the British to occupy Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.) Egypt, the Suez Canal, French Somaliland and British Somaliland were also vulnerable to an attack from <b>Italian</b> East Africa but the rearmament plans of the Comando Supremo (<b>Italian</b> General Staff) were not due to mature until 1942; in 1940 the <b>Italian</b> armed forces were not ready for military operations against a comparable power.|$|E
