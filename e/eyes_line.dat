40|$|The <b>eye</b> <b>line</b> is de¯ned to be a {{horizontal}} line passing the two {{eyes of a}} human face. It {{can be used to}} help locate the true positions of eyes and face. In this paper, we propose a method to extract the horizontal <b>eye</b> <b>line</b> of a face under various environments. Based on the facts that the eye color is very di®erent from skin color and the gray level variance of an eye is high, some eye-like regions are ¯rst located. Then the horizontal <b>eye</b> <b>line</b> is extracted based on the located eye-like regions and some geometric properties in a face. Experimental results are given to show that the proposed method is robust under a wide range of lighting conditions, di®erent poses and races. The detection rate for HHI face database is 95. 63 %. For Champion face database, the detection rate is 94. 27 %...|$|R
50|$|This is when an {{aircraft}} is moving {{at very low}} altitude over a surface that has a regular repeating pattern, for example ripples on water. The pilot's eyes can misinterpret the altitude if each <b>eye</b> <b>lines</b> up {{different parts of the}} pattern rather than both <b>eyes</b> <b>lining</b> up on the same part. This leads to a large error in altitude perception, and any descent can result in impact with the surface. This illusion is of particular danger to helicopter pilots operating at a few metres altitude over calm water.|$|R
