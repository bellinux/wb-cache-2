40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an experimental investigation into ignition systems, {{their effects on}} the combustion process, and how the discharge {{is affected by the}} prevailing pressure, temperature and flow. The work is divided into four main areas, a comprehensive literature review, engine testing for ignition system suitability, non-flow rig testing (including erosion) and flow rig testing. The literature review concluded that the most practical ignition system for lean burn gas engines will continue {{to be based on the}} spark plug, but in the medium to long term, laser ignition may become viable. The measurement of the HT voltage and current is not straightforward, and appropriate methods have been identified. Capacitive and <b>inductive</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> types were compared in lean and diluted conditions on a single cylinder research engine of modern design at different engine loads and speeds. It was found that the most beneficial ignition system was an <b>inductive</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> although that for some conditions, capacitive systems induced better engine performance with a fraction of the stored energy of the inductive alternative. Non flow tests showed that the early part of the spark discharge is sensitive to pressure and temperature effects, and as a consequence, the latter stages of the discharge are also affected. A correlation has been developed, for use with conventional nickel electrode spark plugs, to predict breakdown voltage as a function of pressure, temperature and gap. Experiments were carried out at elevated pressures in a stream of flowing air with capacitive and inductive ignition systems. Different electrode designs and orientations were also compared. It was shown that when exposed to a flow field, the discharge can be stretched which results in a shortened spark duration; in some cases the electrode can shield the discharge from flow field effects. This work showed that flow through the spark gap is a hindrance to the spark process, especially for longer duration systems. However for flame kernel growth, the literature review identified that flow is beneficial, serving to convect the kernel away from the electrodes, reducing the heat transfer from the flame. Analysis of the glow voltage history in the pressurised flow rig has been used to develop a correlation relating the voltage, current, flow velocity, pressure and time. This correlation was used to analyse the velocity records from the spark plug in a firing engine. The predicted velocities and turbulence intensity were in agreement with independent measurements.

40|$|An {{efficient}} combustion {{depends on}} many factors, such as injection, turbulence and ignition characteristics. With {{the improvement of}} internal combustion engines the turbulence intensity and internal pressure have risen, demanding more efficient and powerful ignition systems. In direct injection engines, the stratified charge resultant from the wall/air-guided or spray-guided system requires even more energy. The Paschen’s law shows that spark plug gap and mixture density are proportional to the dielectric rupture voltage. It is known that larger spark gaps promote higher efficiency in the internal combustion engines, since the mixture reaction rate rises proportionally. However, the ignition system must be adequate to the imposed gap, not only on energy, but also on voltage and spark duration. For the reported study in this work two test benches were built: a standard <b>inductive</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> and a capacitive discharge high energy ignition system, with variable voltage and capacitance. The influence of the important parameters energy and ignition voltage on the spark duration, {{as well as the}} electrode gap and shape were analyzed. It was also investigated the utilization of a coil with lower resistance and inductance values, as well as spark plugs with and without internal resistances. ...|$|E
40|$|Running an {{internal}} combustion engine with diluted methane/air mixtures has a potential of reducing emissions and increasing efficiency. However, diluted mixtures need high ignition energy in a sufficiently large volume, which is difficult to accomplish. Increasing the spark duration has {{shown to be a}} promising way of delivering more energy into the diluted charge, but this requires a more sophisticated ignition system. This work focuses on evaluating the effects regarding enhancing early flame development, reducing cyclic variations and extending the lean limit using a new capacitive ignition system as compared to a conventional <b>inductive</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> The new system offers the opportunity to customise the spark by altering the electric pulse train characteristics choosing the number of pulses, the length of the individual pulses as well as the time delay between them. Several different spark configurations were evaluated for the new capacitive system, including varying spark duration between approximately 0. 5 - 1. 2 ms and maximum current levels of 0. 2 - 0. 4 A. Results show that longer spark duration and faster initial energy deposition has a positive effect on the lean limit and the combustion stability, while the current level shows little or no effect on these variables. The more advanced capacitive system is capable of delivering more energy and longer spark duration, resulting in reduced cyclic variations and enhanced early flame development. With the longer spark durations of the capacitive system the lean limit was extended from λ = 1. 65 to approximately λ = 1. 75...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A full factorial experiment was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} internal combustion engine ignition parameters on the air-fuel ratio (A/F) lean limit of combustion with compressed natural gas (CNG). Spark electrical characteristics (voltage, current, power, energy and duration), electrode design, electrode gap and compression ratio were the control variables and A/F lean limit, fuel consumption and hydrocarbon and oxides of nitrogen emission concentrations were the response variables. Experiments were performed on a General Motors' 2. 2 liter four cylinder engine. Spark electrical characteristics were varied by applying various primary voltages and secondary resistances to the production <b>inductive</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> with the engine operating at two operating conditions, a light load and a road load, and with two compression ratios. Cylinder pressure data was acquired to quantify load and combustion stability. Spark electrical characteristics were acquired with a digital oscilloscope to quantify secondary spark electrical characteristics. The results indicated that the response variables were generally insensitive to all the control variables, except for compression ratio. However, contrary to the literature, the A/F lean limit and fuel efficiency degraded with a higher compression ratio. Single and multi-variant linear regressions were studied between the A/F lean limit and the spark electrical characteristics. The only statistically significant and notable finding was a multi-variant linear regression of the A/F lean limit to increasing spark duration and decreasing spark energy at the road load operating condition. Statistical significance of the effect of the ignition system control variables on the response variables was higher at the road load than the light load operating condition. Emissions responded as expected with the higher compression ratio...|$|E
40|$|Lean {{operation}} of spark ignition (SI) automotive engines offers attractive performance incentives. Lowered combustion temperatures inhibit NO[sub]x pollutant formation while reduced manifold throttling minimizes pumping losses, leading to higher efficiency. These benefits are {{offset by the}} reduced combustion speed of lean mixtures, {{which can lead to}} high cycle-to-cycle variation and unacceptable engine behavior characteristics. Hydrogen-enhancement can suppress the undesirable consequences of lean operation by accelerating the combustion process, thereby extending the "lean limit. " Hydrogen can be produced onboard the vehicle with a plasmatron fuel reformer device. Combustion optimization experiments focused on three key areas: the ignition system, charge motion in the inlet ports, and mixture preparation. The ignition system tests compared a standard inductive coil scheme against high-energy discharge systems. Charge motion experiments focused on the impact of turbulence patterns generated by conventional restrictor plates as well as novel inlet flow modification cones. The turbulent motion of each configuration was characterized using swirl and tumble flow benches. Mixture preparation tests compared a standard single-hole pintle injector against a fine atomizing 12 -hole injector. Lastly, a further series of trials was also run to investigate the impact of high exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) dilution rates on combustion stability. Results indicate that optimizations of the combustion system in conjunction with hydrogen-enhancement can extend the lean limit of operation by roughly 25 % compared against the baseline configuration. Nearly half of this improvement may be attributed to improvements in the combustion system. (cont.) An <b>inductive</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> in conjunction with a high tumble-motion inlet configuration leads to the highest levels of combustion performance. Furthermore, hydrogen enhancement affects a nearly constant absolute improvement in the lean misfire limit regardless of baseline combustion behavior. Conversely, the amount of improvement in the point of peak engine NIMEP output is inversely related to the level of baseline performance. by Joshua A. Goldwitz. Thesis (S. M.)

50|$|Capacitor {{discharge}} ignition (CDI) or thyristor ignition {{is a type}} {{of automotive}} electronic <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> which is widely used in outboard motors, motorcycles, lawn mowers, chainsaws, small engines, turbine-powered aircraft, and some cars. It was originally developed to overcome the long charging times associated with high inductance coils used in <b>inductive</b> discharge <b>ignition</b> (IDI) <b>systems,</b> making the <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> more suitable for high engine speeds (for small engines, racing engines and rotary engines).

40|$|The Constant Volume Combustion Chamber (CVCC) at the Combustion Laboratory at the Institute of Marine Technology has shown: (I) Temperature {{related issues}} that reduce {{reproducibility}} within test series. (II) The environment the vessel can simulate is not satisfactory {{in terms of}} density. Previous results and observation {{with the use of}} a high-speed camera indicates that the CVCC has an inhomogeneous temperature field. This is due to unsymmetrical heat loss to the wall after pre-combustion, which is used to chemically heat the CVCC to reach the engine-like conditions. The CVCC can run up to a maximum of 100 [bar], which directly affects how much of the gas used for pre-combustion can be injected. The amount of the gas mixture that the old ignition system was capable of igniting cannot be increased substantially without reaching the pressure limit. These issues were investigated in this present work by installing two types of ignition systems that both aimed to initiate a more symmetrical pre-combustion and to ignite leaner gas mixtures for the pre-combustion. The conventional <b>inductive</b> <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> from Motortech has a dual spark configuration and an alternative ignition system using Corona Discharge made by Øystein Smith and fellow students at the Omega Workshop at the Norwegian University of Technology and Science (NTNU). The experiment we conducted on the conventional ignition system indicated a higher maximum pressure level and a faster pre-combustion with a dual spark plug configuration compared to a single spark plug configuration, which could reduce the temperature gradient, but further experimentation is necessary to conclude on this issue. The system indicated an improved capability to ignite lean mixtures, during experiments where the volume fraction of Carbon Monoxide (CO) was reduced when the GMB was further pressurized with Nitrogen gas (N 2). The corona discharge ignition system has promising properties as a symmetrical ignition source to address both issues presented. The challenge is to introduce the voltage into the CVCC without reaching the dielectric strength of the insulating material surrounding the conducting electrode. This would generate an arc between the electrode and the grounded CVCC. The initial experiments we conducted resulted in spark discharge and not corona discharge with all developed electrodes. Further development on the electrodes and a more controllable signal to drive the corona driver is necessary to get this ignition system working properly...|$|E

The move from proprietary technologies to more standardized and open solutions together with the increased number of connections between SCADA systems, office networks and the Internet has made them more vulnerable to types of network attacks that are relatively common in computer security.
