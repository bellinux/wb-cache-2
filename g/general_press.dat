5|$|While {{the general}} public were baffled {{that a man who}} just scored a century against Australia could be left out of the team, the English cricketing press were divided on the decision. Some journalists {{supported}} the MCC on cricketing grounds, including the cricket correspondents of The Times and The Daily Telegraph. Others, prominently the former England captain Ted Dexter, the former Test player Trevor Bailey and E.W. Swanton, all of whom generally sided with the cricket establishment, contended that D'Oliveira deserved to be in the team on merit. Swanton said he had received no letters which actually agreed with the omission. Other commentators, such as the Worcestershire club secretary and the former West Indies Test player Learie Constantine, openly stated that D'Oliveira was omitted either because of his race or because the MCC supported apartheid. Some Labour politicians also expressed concern. John Arlott, while asserting that D'Oliveira deserved to be included, suggested that to demonstrate opposition to apartheid, the MCC should perhaps have selected him even if this were not the case. The <b>general</b> <b>press</b> took a wider view, with several newspaper columns reporting that the decision appeared to have been made to avoid offending the South African government. According to Williams, the public positions held by much of the MCC committee towards South Africa led to suspicions that D'Oliveira may have been left out simply to save the tour.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, he {{published}} his team's mapping, using X-ray crystallography, {{of a human}} common cold virus in the journal Nature.

25|$|The university's student {{newspaper}} is The Carillon. It {{for many years}} was an organ of radical student dissent and in the 1960s and 70s frequently had a very high community profile as its editorial postures occasioned vigorous denunciation by university administration figures and in the conservative <b>general</b> <b>press.</b> As student mores in subsequent generations have become less disputatious the Carillon {{has evolved into a}} less political paper which currently is a somewhat conventional newsletter of campus affairs.|$|E

500|$|Leech {{released}} the new designs {{to the press}} about November 10, 1891. According to numismatist David Lange, the new coinage received mixed reviews: [...] "while the <b>general</b> <b>press</b> and public seemed satisfied with the new dime, quarter dollar, and half dollar, numismatists were either mildly disappointed with the new coins or remained silent on the matter." [...] Moran records a number of unfavorable reviews, without listing any favorable ones. Vermeule stated that [...] "the initial comment on the new coinage concerned the novelty of a contest, its failure, and the inevitable result that the commission would go, as always, to the Chief Engraver [...] and his staff." ...|$|E
500|$|In the beginning, the CDC did {{not have}} an {{official}} name for the disease, often referring to it by way of the diseases that were associated with it, for example, lymphadenopathy, the disease after which the discoverers of HIV originally named the virus. They also used Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections, the name by which a task force had been set up in 1981. In the <b>general</b> <b>press,</b> the term GRID, which stood for gay-related immune deficiency, had been coined. The CDC, in search of a name, and looking at the infected communities coined [...] "the 4H disease", as it seemed to single out homosexuals, heroin users, hemophiliacs, and Haitians. However, after determining that AIDS was not isolated to the gay community, it was realized that the term GRID was misleading and AIDS was introduced at a meeting in July 1982. By September 1982 the CDC started using the name AIDS.|$|E

2500|$|With her sudden rise to stardom, Amuro {{was noted}} by journalists and {{commentators}} as a trendsetter to the Japanese public. She became {{a lot more}} prominent in fashion magazines, and the <b>general</b> <b>press,</b> for the typical Japanese idol departure, in favour of [...] "dyeing their hair brown, plucking their eyebrows... High heels, a miniskirt, and tattoos,". Additionally, her fan base were considered [...] "Amura's". This was a reason why critics noticed she stood out from her contemporaries, namely Hamasaki, and other idol singers. However, David W. Edgington—writer of the novel Japan at the Millennium: Joining Past and Future—opined that Amuro had changed the stereotypical idol culture, whereas writer Marwan Kraidy believed {{she was part of}} [...] "Japan's rising cultural power" [...] towards the world. Furthermore, an author from the U.S.-Japan Women's Centre believed the singer's success of Sweet 19 Blues was the reason many people emulated her as a role model between 1996 and 1997.
