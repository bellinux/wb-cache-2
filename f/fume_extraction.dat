25|$|The Leclerc is {{equipped}} with a GIAT (Nexter) CN120-26 120mm smoothbore cannon. This cannon is capable of firing the same NATO standard 120mm rounds as the German Leopard 2 and US M1 Abrams, but in practice only French-produced ammunition is issued. The gun is insulated with a thermal sleeve and has an automatic compressed-air <b>fume</b> <b>extraction</b> system instead of the usual bore evacuator. The Leclerc has a unique autoloading system which was specifically designed for it, and reduces the crew to three by eliminating the human loader. The turret of the Leclerc was designed around the auto-loading system {{in order to avoid the}} problems common to other tanks with an autoloader. The Leclerc autoloader allows a rate of fire of 12 shots per minute and holds 22 rounds of ready ammunition; it can accommodate up to six different types of ammunition at once, although like most autoloader systems it cannot change ammunition types once a round has been loaded. The most common types are the armour piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS) with a tungsten core and the high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round. There are 18 other rounds available for reload. A Leclerc tank can fire while traveling at a speed of 50km/h on a target 4,000 metres away. The gun is 52 calibres long instead of the 44 calibres common on most tanks of the Leclerc's generation, giving the rounds a higher muzzle velocity.|$|E

50|$|Three basic {{types of}} {{procedures}} {{are used for}} treating the affected workers: reducing a worker's exposure, removing a worker from the environment with the asthma-causing agent, and treatment with asthma medications. Completely stopping exposure is more effective treatment than reducing exposure. By reducing exposure, the probability of suffering another reaction is lowered. Methods of reducing exposure include transferring an affected worker to a position without the relevant asthmagen, use of respiratory protection, and engineering controls.

40|$|Following {{the fire}} which {{occurred}} in March 1999 in the Mont Blanc tunnel located between France and Italy, an Appraisal Committee {{has been committed}} to assess the safety of 40 existing French road tunnels, with a length exceeding 1 km. Later, a new regulatory document (circular) was issued (25 / 08 / 2000) {{about the safety of}} existing road tunnels. In this document, a new procedure is requested : a specific hazards study (SHS). A work is still under progress between different partners to define the methodology to be applied for these SHS. Every SHS will be submitted for acceptance to a National Evaluation Committee. New regulations are under preparation. Such SHS are prepared only after achievements of preliminary studies (traffic studies, rules of operations, specific study for the transportation of dangerous goods if any [...] .) from which a reference state if defined. The different steps of this SHS are : risks identification, definition of scenarios (standardised and customized) from which it is possible to describe a sequence of events, possible consequences and the validity of the system management of the system especially in emergency situations. The conclusion of the study is the evaluation of the safety level with possible use of severity/occurrence matrix. Proposals are then to be made by the contractor and operator to improve the safety level on weak points. Among the difficult issues are : the need for preventive closure of a tunnel when a situation is incidental but without major consequences, the assessment of fire developments for different types of vehicles and the influence of the ventilation, the efficiency of fire <b>fumes</b> <b>extraction,</b> the definition and use of severity/occurrence matrix...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{a case of}} {{hydrogen}} release in a typical research laboratory for the characterisation {{of hydrogen}} solid-state storage materials has been considered. The laboratory is equipped with various testing equipments {{for the assessment of}} hydrogen capacity in materials typically in the 1 to 200 bar pressure range and temperatures up to 500 °C. Hydrogen is delivered at 200 bar by a 50 l gas bottle and a compressor located outside the laboratory. The safety measures directly related to hydrogen hazard consist in a distributed ventilation of the laboratory and air <b>extraction</b> <b>fume</b> hoods located on top of each instrument. Goal of this work is the modelling of hydrogen accidental release in a real laboratory case, in order to provide a more fundamental basis for the laboratory safety design and assist the decision on the number and position of the safety sensors. The computational fluid dynamics code (CFD) ANSYS-CFX has been selected in order to perform the numerical investigations. Two basic accidental release scenarios have been assumed both at 200 bar: a major leak corresponding to a guillotine breaking of the hydrogen distribution line and a smaller leak typical for a not properly tight junction.

50|$|In 1881 he {{was awarded}} a French patent for the first arc welding process. This used a carbon {{electrode}} to generate an arc to the workpiece.

50|$|One {{drawback}} to PVC materials is that hot working them produces noxious fumes containing hydrochloric acid and potentially even dioxins.

Where PVC materials are cut by laser, this is a highly specialized process requiring adapted machines and acid-specific <b>fume</b> <b>extraction</b> and filtering.|$|E
50|$|The BMP-1 has a conical turret {{equipped}} with a <b>fume</b> <b>extraction</b> system and an electric traverse drive with a manual backup system. The main gun has a dead-zone over the commander's hatch (between the 10:00 and 11:00 o'clock positions), where the gun must be elevated over the infra-red searchlight to avoid crushing it. When the gun is facing backwards, it prevents hatches {{on top of the}} troop compartment from opening. The low profile of the turret makes it a difficult target. The same turret is used in the BMD-1.|$|E
50|$|Fans produce flows {{with high}} volume and low {{pressure}} (although higher than ambient pressure), {{as opposed to}} compressors which produce high pressures at a comparatively low volume.

It is sometimes incorrectly known as the BMP-A by some Western sources. NATO gave it the designation BMP Model 1966.|$|E
5000|$|Solvent: This term {{is used to}} {{describe}} any ink that is not water-based. Piezo inkjet printers whose inks use petroleum or a petroleum by-product such as an acetone like carrier liquid. [...] "Eco-Solvent" [...] inks usually contain glycol esters or glycol ether esters and are slower drying. The resulting prints are waterproof. May be used to print directly on uncoated vinyl and other media as well as ridged substrates such as Painted/Coated Metal, Foam Board and PVC. The solvents soften the base material and allow the ink pigments to mechanically latch on to the chemically etched surface. Certain ink manufacturers have different bite based on what solvent carriers they use. Which is what makes solvent ink prints more durable than aqueous inks. However, solvent inks give off strong odor or fumes when drying, as the carrier fluid dissipates through applied heat from the printer's platen. There are various levels of solvent ink ranging from [...] "True or Full Solvent" [...] to [...] "Medium/Mild Solvent" [...] {{all the way down}} to [...] "Eco-Solvent". The fume and odour levels decrease accordingly, so does the surface etch of the base material. Full to Medium/Mild Solvents require <b>fume</b> <b>extraction</b> to be considered safe in the working environment. Most Eco-Solvents can be used in an office environment with minimal or tolerable odor levels.|$|E

The temperature distribution was incorporated in a thermal stress analysis and a total stress profile was obtained for the radial as well as circumferencial positions. Areas of maximum stress were identified and the theory of fatigue failure due to cyclic operation was applied to these maximum stress conditions. The ABAQUS finite element program was used to model the behaviour of the material under the operating conditions using the sequencially coupled heat transfer and stress analysis routine. The results obtained correlates well with the actual failure of water-cooled ducting sections in operation and provides a platform for designing and optimising similar equipment for industrial applications...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{nanoparticles}} are generated as by-products during ultrashort-pulsed laser ablation. Airborne nanoparticulate matter {{is well known}} as potential health risk when workers are exposed during operation of laser machinery. In order to provide safety-related statements on nanoparticles generated during laser micromachining, we studied the particle size distribution dur-ing picosecond (ps) and femtosecond (fs) laser ablation. At the same pulse energy, fs pulses release similar share of nanoparticles (> 80 %) in the aerosol fraction, with fs compared to ps generating a far higher share 7 nm sized particles during machining of metals (steel, brass) and ceramics (zirconia). These nanoparticles sampled at the workplace have the same chemical composition than the ablated material (iron-chromium-nickel alloy, yttria-doped zirconia). A quantitative risk assessment is car-ried and compared with indicators of toxicological effects of inhaled nanoparticles. The surface equivalent of the nanoparticles dispersed in the air of the workplace is not likely to exceed the sur-face dose which cause inflammatory response in animal lung. But within one 8 h shift, the back-ground level is exceeded by a factor of 20 so that efficient <b>fume</b> <b>extraction</b> is strongly recommended for safe operation during fs and pf laser micromachining even in research laboratories...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFume and hygiene hoods {{are widely}} used to prevent {{fugitive}} emissions from charge ports, tap holes and many other openings in mineral processing and smelting vessels. The highly buoyant nature of the fume combined with often complex geometries {{make the design of}} these hoods difficult with traditional engineering tools. However, by combining the traditional engineering approach with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, a clear understanding of the shortfalls of an existing system can be obtained, and an optimised hood design can be achieved. This paper reports on a combined engineering and CFD analysis of a <b>fume</b> <b>extraction</b> system for a zinc slag fumer charge port. The engineering model revealed that the existing plant components (bag house and fan) were not capable of capturing the required amount of fume, and that the original hood design was flawed. The CFD model was then used to predict the fume capture and emission from the existing hood. CFD model predictions showed that increasing the draft flow rate by an order of magnitude would only give a marginal improvement in fume capture. Using findings of both the models enabled a new fume capture hood to be designed. CFD analysis of the new hood revealed that a significant improvement in fume capture is possible. Construction and installation of the hood has been performed and a 65 % reduction in fume emission was achieved, thus significantly mitigating a long-standing emission problem...|$|E
40|$|Decorative ethanol {{fireplaces}} {{are becoming}} more and more commonly used in many different countries. These fireplaces are constructed such that they have no <b>fume</b> <b>extraction</b> system, and so all of the gases from combustion, volatile organic compounds, and particulate emissions are released into the room. In order to determine the release behavior and the chemical composition of the emissions, a variety of combinations of ethanol fireplaces and fuels were examined in a 48 m 3 emission test chamber under typical living room environmental conditions. Four ethanol fireplaces with 8 different fuels (3 liquid samples, 5 gel-type samples) were tested. The ventilation conditions were set up corresponding to the manufacturers' recommendations and DIN 4734 - 1. The air concentrations in the chamber were evaluated based on guideline values for indoor air. Of the combustion gases examined, the quantity of carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide in particular were close to or even above the guideline values in many cases. A release of components of the fuel (e. g., the denaturing substances) was also detected in the chamber air. In two experiments, a benzene concentration of over 12 ppb and an increased formaldehyde concentration (&# 62; 0. 1 ppm) were identified in the chamber air. The ethanol fireplaces were - irrespective of the type of fuel used - strong sources of fine and ultrafine particles. Overall, ethanol fireplaces have a considerable influence on the quality of the indoor air due to the lack of ventilation. This aspect should - in addition to fire protection - be properly considered when using such devices...|$|E
40|$|The {{extraction}} of welding fumes must be optimised {{in order to}} achieve an improvement in the working conditions for welders and protection from harmful welding fumes. The integrated extractor torches offer a high potential here since these permit extraction directly at the place where the fumes originate and make the laborious handling of an extraction hood unnecessary. In order to allow the further minimisation of the burdens caused by harmful metal oxides arising during welding, a comprehensive investigation of systems already available on the market was conducted within the framework of a research project and an optimised trade-off (compromise) solution was developed from this. For this purpose, the existing systems were initially investigated and assessed with the aid of CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulation and a special schlieren test bench. On the basis of the specific properties of the systems investigated in each case, it was possible to develop the trade-off solution and to investigate and assess it also using CFD simulations and the schlieren test bench in realistic conditions. Not only the welding <b>fume</b> <b>extraction</b> but also the shielding gas coverage were investigated and assessed in this respect so that the extractor torch system could be optimised in an all-encompassing way. The measurement of the welding fume emissions made it possible to confirm the good results for the trade-off solution and to prove a distinct reduction in the harmful emissions in comparison with other extractor torch variants. Thus, a system which unites a high extraction capacity with good shielding gas coverage and, at the same time, has a compact construction shape is now available. It may not only reduce the dangers for the welder due to harmful welding fumes but also increase the competitiveness of welding plants using local extraction systems and an optimised welding quality...|$|E
40|$|Particulate welding fumes {{can enter}} unciliated airways, or {{may even be}} absorbed through the skin, {{possibly}} {{to the detriment of}} the health of welders. The size and shape of the particulates will determine their ability to infiltrate the human body. Hence, the sensitivity of particulate fume size to welding parameters such as arc voltage (20 – 36 V) and metal transfer mode (dip, globular and spray) was assessed. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging was used for determining particulate fume size and it was found to be an accurate, reproducible, and relatively simple technique. The results revealed a higher percentage of ultra fine particulates (i. e. in 3 ̆c 20 nm and 20 – 40 nm intervals) in ‘low welding voltage’ fume plume compared with ‘high welding voltage’ fume plume. Fundamentally, the fume plume created during dip metal transfer at low welding voltages (20 – 26 V) had much lower levels of particulate fume concentration compared with spray metal transfer at high welding voltages (30 - 36 V). TEM also revealed that for the range of welding voltages and metal transfer modes investigated, the particulates produced were predominantly less than 100 nm in diameter and spherical. Spherical particles (3 ̆c 100 nm) have been reported elsewhere to reach the alveoli in rats and, hence, may be of relevance with respect to the health of welders. Slightly faceted crystalline particulates and fume particle sizes of up to 800 nm in diameter were also observed with TEM. It should be noted that the agglomeration behaviour of these particulates in the fume plume is considered important but not entirely understood. The particle size results suggest that the key to welder safety is to minimize cumulative exposure to particulate fume over their working life, irrespective of the welding parameters used. Innovative <b>fume</b> <b>extraction</b> techniques, clean workshops, automated welding, and low welding fume consumables should all form part of an integrated solution to help ensure the health and well-being of welding personnel...|$|E

A small vessel of 10 ml capacity, also constructed from PTFE and polypropylene, was developed for very small samples. These were used for the digestion of blood. A design for a simple modification of microwave ovens for use in the laboratory has been investigated. A Sharp microwave oven was lined with polypropylene and an extraction system that worked by the Venturi effect was used to remove the fumes from the cavity of the oven. This modification was found to be adequate to prevent corrosion of the oven and to provide the necessary safety features required for a laboratory system. In another modification, a thermocouple and a controller were used for maintaining the temperatures of the samples. Ports were available at the top of the cavity for insertion of suitable vessels for a variety of investigations. A computer-controlled waveguide has been designed for general laboratory applications. The temperature of the samples could be monitored and controlled. The waveguide was used for investigating sample digestions and the heating characteristics of a wide range of materials. A cylindrical applicator has been developed for the microwave heating of large (ca. 300 - 600 ml) samples. Temperature monitoring and control was achieved through the use of a thermocouple and a computer. The instrument was found useful for many laboratory investigations involving relatively large samples. A new applicator has been developed for the even heating of multiple laboratory samples. The vessels (tubes) were introduced into the multimode cavity through ports. A choke was developed to allow rotation of the ports and the samples inside the cavity. Vapours could be extracted from the vessels outside the cavity using a <b>fume</b> <b>extraction</b> system.
