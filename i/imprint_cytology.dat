This assay detects the expression level of cytokeratin 19 (CK 19) which is present in some but not all breast tumors. In this study, the clinical significance of negative CK 19 was investigated in 219 cases of primary breast cancer. In 179 patients with clinically negative nodes, OSNA and <b>imprint</b> smear <b>cytology</b> of SLN were performed simultaneously. The OSNA revealed a node-positive rate of 24. 6 %. Negative CK 19 correlated significantly with negative ER/PgR and higher Ki- 67 values, and marginally with higher nuclear grade and p 53 overexpression.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of Touch <b>Imprint</b> <b>Cytology</b> {{in the diagnosis}} of various pathological processes was evaluated and compared with Frozen Section in intraoperative consultation. We examined 60 cases from various sites {{of the body that}} were referred for intraoperative consultation. All cases were analyzed by Touch <b>Imprint</b> <b>Cytology</b> followed by Frozen section. We found diagnostic accuracy of both procedures comparable. The diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions by combined procedures was 100 %. There were no false positive or false negative cases. For diagnosing specific subtypes of malignancy, the diagnostic accuracy of each method alone was 96. 6 % with a sensitivity of 86 % and specificity of 100 % and the combined sensitivity 90 %. Touch <b>Imprint</b> <b>Cytology</b> provided better cellular morphology and fewer artifacts.

40|$|BACKGROUND : The sentinal node biopsy (SNB) is a {{reliable}} method {{for determining the}} status of the regional lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer. SNB technology is evolving rapidly, but no standardization has yet been accomplished. The aim {{of this study is to}} discuss the accuracy of this procedure and the optimal method for identifying micrometastases. METHODS : We collected data from 70 women with primary invasive breast carcinoma who underwent SNB for breast cancer. We examined two frozen sections levels from each half of each lymph node, as well as a <b>cytology</b> <b>imprint</b> before arriving at the frozen section diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry with pancytokeratin (AE 1 /AE 3) was done on the paraffin sections. For the association between the lymph node size and the possibility of metastases, Student&#x 2032;s t test was used and a P value of less than 0. 05 was regarded as significant. RESULTS : The number of patients with metastases in SNB was 19, from which 15 cases were correctly diagnosed in frozen sections/imprints and four cases were false negative. The axillary toilet from all cases with SNB metastases smaller than 2 mm showed no additional positive nodes. Lymph node diameter showed a significant association with sentinel node status (P &# 60; 0. 0001). CONCLUSION : Frozen section examination of SNB from patients with breast carcinoma is both specific (100 &#x 0025;) and sensitive (79 &#x 0025;). Diagnosis of lobular carcinoma can be difficult, and may require immunohistochemistry with cytokeratin for diagnosis.

METHODS: A cross-sectional validation of diagnostic test involving 34 patients from the outpatient clinic of the Maternity School Assis Chateaubriand. The patients had locally advanced breast cancer and were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Those with clinically negative axilla underwent SLN biopsy, studied by imprint and histopathology in paraffin. All patients underwent axillary dissection and its histopathological study. RESULTS: The SLN identification rate was 85. 3 % (29 / 34). The sensitivity of imprint associated with paraffin on detection of metastasis compared to histopathology of the axillary content was 84. 62 % and specificity of 100 % with false-negative rate of 12. 01 % and an accuracy of 92. 77 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH) is a proliferative {{disorder of}} Langerhans cells, but {{the nature of}} LCH, whether reactive, benign, or malignant and neoplastic, is controversial. We encountered a case of LCH showing a malignant phenotype initially localized in the skin of an elderly woman. Since {{there is no other}} report on the cytologic appearance of primary cutaneous LCH or on LCH with a malignant phenotype, we compared the cytologic features of this case with those of benign cases at other sites reported in the literature. CASE: A 74 -year-old woman presented with a gradually enlarging and partially ulcerated skin lesion expanding both sides of her right hand. On histologic and ultrastructural analyses of surgically resected tissue, we diagnosed the lesion as Langerhans cell histiocytosis originating in the skin. Although the patient had no recurrence or metastases for six months after surgical resection of the primary skin lesion and radiation therapy, the tumor extended multisystemically, and the patient died of multiple organ failure 14 months after the initial diagnosis. CONCLUSION: <b>Imprint</b> and scrape <b>cytology</b> of multiple skin lesions six months after surgery was useful in immediately diagnosing the recurrent LCH.

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology,</b> histology and CLO-test (for biopsy urease) in detecting Helicobacter pylori infection, antral biopsies were taken from 239 patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Both <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> and histology showed the presence of H. pylori in 215 (90 %) patients. The sensitivity and specificity of <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> vis-à-vis histology was noted to be 100 %. The CLO-test was performed in 165 patients and was positive in 130 (79 %) patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the CLO-test were 89 % and 95 %, respectively. The median time required for the CLO-test to become positive and for imprint was 60 minutes for each. The sensitivity of the CLO-test was reduced further in patients receiving colloidal bismuth subcitrate. Of the 27 patients receiving the drug {{the sensitivity of the}} CLO-test was only 9 % after 4 weeks of therapy. However, the specificity was 100 %. The sensitivity and specificity of <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> were unaffected by the antimicrobial therapy and after 4 weeks of treatment were still 100 %. It is concluded that the CLO-test has a lower sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing H. pylori infection compared to <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology,</b> which had a sensitivity and specificity equal to that of histology. <b>Imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> may be prepared as an adjunct to histology in patients in whom antral biopsies are taken as it offers a relatively quick diagnosis of H. pylori infection, is considerably cheaper than the CLO-test and does not require additional biopsy material...|$|E
40|$|Background: Preoperative fine needle {{aspiration}} biopsy/FNAB examination, <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> and frozen section intraoperative has big {{implications for}} diagnosis and surgical strategy of thyroid nodules with follicular neoplasm cytology. FNAB and frozen section has its limitations, {{it is difficult}} to detect the presence of capsular and/or vascular invasion of thyroid follicular carcinoma. Whereas imprint cytology can preserve cellular overview (especially the cell nucleus), including the capsular and/or vascular invasion. In addition, <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> is faster than frozen section. Frozen section examination could not indicate the presence of capsular and/or vascular invasion in most cases so that imprint cytology is used to replace frozen section as an alternative. Method: This research is a diagnostic test study using a descriptive design. This is a prospective study to assess the sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV of <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> in patients with thyroid follicular neoplasm cytology.   Results: In our study; sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> for follicular neoplasm was found as 84. 21 %, 95. 45 %, 94. 12 %, 87. 50 % and 90. 24 % respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the possible additional diagnostic information provided by <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> when performing ultrasound-guided transthoracic core biopsy and to evaluate whether it could optimise the biopsy procedure. A total of 155 transthoracic core biopsies with touch imprint smears were performed under ultrasound guidance, with 127 malignant and 28 benign lesions. The imprint smears were stained using Riu 9 s method and interpreted by a cytopathologist. These were compared with the histopathology of core biopsy specimens and the final diagnosis of malignant versus benign disease. The overall diagnostic accuracy of <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> was 94 % (146 out of 155). Histopathological analysis showed an overall accuracy of 94 % (146 out of 155), with a sensitivity of 94 % (119 out of 127) and negative predictive value of 79 % (27 out of 34). The combination of these two methodologies had an increased overall accuracy and negative predictive value of 98 % (152 out of 155) and 90 % (28 out of 31), respectively. The results of <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> and histopathology were in agreement in 143 patients (92 %). In conclusion, <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> of ultrasound-guided transthoracic core biopsy is a sensitive procedure for diagnosing peripheral thoracic lesions, and it may increase the diagnostic accuracy and cancer negative prediction of biopsy alone.

40|$|Background: Cytology of the {{endometrium}} is an underused {{technique in}} diagnostic pathology. It {{has been used}} in the past for endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. Only few studies have used cytology in the diagnosis of dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB). Endometrial <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> has been rarely used except for application of immunocytochemistry in diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma. Aim: The present study was conducted to evaluate whether it is possible to assign histopathology-like diagnosis by <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> and also to evaluate its usefulness in the assessment of patients of dysfunctional uterine bleeding of low clinical suspicion. Materials and Methods: Imprint smears were made from 93 curettage materials during a study of DUB. Blinded analysis of imprint smears was performed by using McKenzie′s criteria and some criteria devised for the requirements of this study. Results of cytology were correlated with histopathology. Statistical analysis was carried out by GraphpadInStat Demo.

40|$|To retest the {{hypothesis}} that <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> {{may be used to}} reliably diagnose parathyroid tissue and, if so, to ascertain whether accuracy in this technique may be easily attained. STUDY DESIGN: Imprint preparations from 15 parathyroid, 10 thyroid, 8 lymphoreticular and 2 adipose tissue specimens were assessed blindly by two pathologists, one of whom (pathologist B) had only limited experience with endocrine tissue <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology.</b> RESULTS: Both assessors consistently distinguished parathyroid and thyroid preparations from lymphoreticular and adipose tissue preparations. While there was occasional difficulty in distinguishing between parathyroid and thyroid preparations, this was usually attributable to the scanty nature of the preparations.

Patients and methods A total of 93 women with microcalcifications BI-RADS 3 and 4 underwent VABB and imprint samples were examined. VABB was performed on Fischer's table using 11 -gauge Mammotome vacuum probes. A mammogram of the cores after the procedure confirmed the excision of microcalcifications. For the application of <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology,</b> the cores with microcalcifications confirmed by mammogram were gently rolled against glass microscope slides and thus imprint smears were made. For rapid preliminary diagnosis Diff-Quick stain, modified Papanicolaou stain and May Grunwald Giemsa were used. Afterwards, the core was dipped into a CytoRich Red Collection fluid for a few seconds in order to obtain samples {{with the use of the}} specimen wash. After the completion of cytological procedures, the core was prepared for routine histological study. The pathologist was blind to the preliminary cytological results. The cytological and pathological diagnoses were comparatively evaluated. Results According to the pathological examination, 73 lesions were benign, 15 lesions were carcinomas (12 ductal carcinomas in situ, 3 invasive ductal carcinomas), and 5 lesions were precursor: 3 cases of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and 2 cases of lobular neoplasia (LN). The observed sensitivity and specificity of the cytological imprints for cancer were 100 % (one-sided, 97. 5 % CI: 78. 2 %– 100 %). Only one case of ADH could be detected by <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology.</b> Neither of the two LN cases was detected by the imprints. The imprints were uninformative in 11 out of 93 cases (11. 8 %). There was no uninformative case among women with malignancy. Conclusion <b>Imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> provides a rapid, accurate preliminary diagnosis in a few minutes. This method might contribute to the diagnosis of early breast cancer and possibly attenuates patients' anxiety. </p...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveSentinel {{lymph node}} biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer {{patients}} is emerging as a promising minimally-invasive tool. There has been an exponential increase in the literature related to sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in breast cancer patients, mainly from Western centres. This study was carried out to address issues relevant to breast cancer patients in developing countries, including the method of SLN detection, the role of <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> {{in the assessment of}} SLN, and the role of SLNB in locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). MethodsThis study included 76 women with breast cancer. The blue-dye method was used to identify the sentinel node. Touch imprint smears were prepared from the sectioned node, stained using the Jenner-Geimsa technique, and examined for tumour deposits. ResultsSentinel nodes were identified in 69 of 76 patients. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of SLNB in predicting axillary node status were 84. 2 %, 100 % and 91. 3 %, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of intraoperative <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> were 96. 9 %, 100 % and 98. 6 %, respectively. ConclusionsThese results prove that high levels of SLN detection can be achieved using the blue-dye method alone. Its role in LABC patients needs further evaluation. In view of promising results, <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> should be used more frequently as an alternative to frozen section for the assessment of sentinel nodes...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> of core needle biopsy (CNB) specimens from breast lesions {{is a useful}} method of rapidly obtaining additional diagnostic information and potentially {{can be used to}} reduce the number of biopsies needed. STUDY DESIGN: Cytologic analysis was performed on 173 breast lesions and compared with their histopathologic diagnoses (143 malignant and 30 benign). For <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology,</b> one CNB specimen was rolled between two slides and stained with Diff-Quik and Papanicolaou stain. RESULTS: The diagnostic overall accuracy of Diff-Quik stain (Papanicolaou stain) was 95. 4 % (95. 9 %), with a sensitivity of 96. 5 % (97. 2 %), specificity of 90 % (90 %), positive predictive value of 97. 8 % (97. 8 %) and negative predictive value of 84. 3 % (87. 0 %). There was no statistically significant difference between the stains. Histo-pathologic analysis had an overall accuracy of 97. 7 %, with a sensitivity of 97. 2 %, specificity and positive predictive value of 100 % and a negative predictive value of 88. 2 %. CONCLUSION: <b>Imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> of CNBs is a sensitive method of detecting malignancies in breast tumors. Diff-Quik is a rapid and reliable approach that can reduce the number of biopsies. Inadequate and suspicious cases should be evaluated based on complementary diagnostic procedures for breast lesions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Emperipolesis is a {{condition}} in which viable hemato-poetic cells are seen intact in the cytoplasm of host cell without damage. This phenomenon is seen in many physiologic and pathologic conditions, its presence in Rosai Dorfman disease (RDD) is characteristic of the disease. However emperipolesis is an uncommon finding in malignant lymphoma both Hodgkins and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, wherein it has been described in bone marrow aspirate and tissue culture. In con-trast there are only two case reports of emperipolesis phe-nomenon described in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in tissue sec-tions. We report a case of an adult T cell lymphoblastic lymph-oma (mediastinal type) with features of emperipolesis demon-strated at fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> of cervical lymph nodes. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of emperipolesis in a case of adult T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (mediastinal type) -detected at FNAC and <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology...</b>|$|E
40|$|Value of <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> for ultrasound-guided transthoracic core biopsy To the Editors: LIAO et al. [1] {{have shown}} that <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> of ultrasound-guided transthoracic core biopsy is a {{sensitive}} procedure for diagnosing peripheral thoracic lesions. Similarly, we have recently reported {{the results of our}} experience of using touch imprint smears prepared from computerised tomographic-guided core needle lung biopsies [2]. We correlated the cytological diagnosis of touch imprint smears with the histological diagnosis of the corresponding core needle-biopsy specimen, which was taken as the gold standard. There were no false-positive results, and all patients with small cell lung cancer were correctly diagnosed from the imprint smear. We agree that the technique is a quick, sensitive and highly specific method of detecting lung malignancies, and this may be particularly important with small cell lung cancer, where one may wish to start urgent chemotherapy pending the result of formal histology...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} which {{diagnostic test}} is preferable for {{the diagnosis of}} Helicobacter pylori in patients with gastroduodenal disease. STUDY DESIGN: H pylori infection was diagnosed prospectively in 101 patients. Diagnosis of H pylori was made by tests based on five different principles: (1) culture, (2) direct histologic demonstration, (3) <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology,</b> (4) brushing cytology, and (5) gram staining of H pylori. Efficacy of each test was compared. RESULTS: All the tests were reliable for diagnosing H pylori infection; 73. 3 % of patients showed concordance {{in at least two}} tests. All the tests were positive in > 50 % of patients. Significant concordance between brushing and <b>imprint</b> <b>cytology</b> was also determined. These two tests have almost similar specificity when compared to other tests. CONCLUSION: When patients undergo upper endoscopy, we recommend taking biopsy specimens for culture and histology. H pylori can be assessed equally well with all the tests, but imprint and brushing cytology have the advantage of rapid response, specificity, much lower cost and reproducibility...|$|E
