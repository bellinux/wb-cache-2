2500|$|After {{finishing}} 14th at Pocono, {{the series}} moved to Talladega. [...] As the race wound down, Davey Allison was poised {{for yet another}} win behind leader Dale Earnhardt. [...] But Davey was unable to get drafting help from fellow Ford Motor Company drivers and he slipped to ninth place after attempting to pass Earnhardt for the lead. In his post-race interview, Allison stated [...] "All we needed was three inches to clear Earnhardt, when you can't get help from a fellow Ford driver, that's pitiful". In a fit of rage after the race, Allison punched a wall in the team's transporter, breaking his wrist. [...] The injury failed to slow him down, however as he finished a remarkable 10th on the road course at Watkins Glen, then was second at Michigan, a photo-finish in which Dale Jarrett scored his first Winston Cup victory. Davey scored back-to-back victories at Rockingham and Phoenix and entered the final race at Atlanta second in the Winston Cup standings. But a <b>dead</b> <b>battery</b> in that race relegated him to a 17th-place finish, dropping him to third in the final standings, only four points behind Ricky Rudd. Dale Earnhardt won the championship. [...] The final tally of the 1991 season for Davey Allison; five wins, 12 top-five and 16 top-ten finishes, and three pole positions. [...] It was also during the 1991 season that Davey and Liz welcomed their second child, a son, Robert Grey Allison. With Larry McReynolds at the helm, Davey Allison entered the 1992 season as a legitimate championship contender.|$|E

The E-Mag's design is unique in that it retains a mechanical link between the trigger and firing mechanism; the electronics work with manipulate electromagnets that lessen the pull strength.

50|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1976 models, and {{continuing}} for the 1977 and 1978 models, significant {{changes were made}} to the electrical system.

30|$|There was no {{significant}} difference in fracture rate; there were two fractures in the manual group (5  %) and one fracture in the motorized group (4  %). There were four different mechanical failures in the motorized group: <b>dead</b> <b>batteries,</b> a bent plug, a bent rod and a motor that failed because of torque. The unexpected battery failures were caused by excessively high chlorine levels in the rehabilitation facility swimming pool that dissolved the neoprene seals. All of these problems were diagnosed quickly, the failures were repaired and the lengthening procedures were continued.|$|R
50|$|Some AC battery {{chargers}} have a boost, engine start, or engine assist feature. Despite {{being able to}} assist in jump starting a dead vehicle battery, these types of {{battery chargers}} perform their task {{over a longer period}} of time, rather than an instantaneous boost. Boosting a <b>dead</b> <b>battery</b> through a battery charger can take anywhere from five to twenty minutes depending on the depth-of-discharge (DOD), health of the vehicle battery, and type of engine (engine displacement). AC power is not usually available for a roadside boost.|$|E

25|$|Batteries {{are used}} either as sole or as backup power for {{residential}} smoke detectors.

It {{has been found}} that battery-powered smoke detectors in many houses have <b>dead</b> <b>batteries.</b> It has been estimated that in the UK over 30% of smoke alarms may have <b>dead</b> or removed <b>batteries.</b> In response public information campaigns have been created to remind people to change smoke detector batteries regularly. In Australia, for example, a public information campaign suggests that smoke alarm batteries should be replaced on April Fools' Day every year. In regions using daylight saving time, campaigns may suggest that people change their batteries when they change their clocks or on a birthday.|$|R
