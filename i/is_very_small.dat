5|$|Forensic {{examination}} of any trace evidence {{is based upon}} Locard's exchange principle. This states that every contact leaves a trace. In practice, even though a transfer of material has taken place, it may be impossible to detect, because the amount transferred <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small.</b>|$|E
5|$|Secondary pneumothoraces {{are only}} treated {{conservatively}} if the size <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> (1 cm or less air rim) {{and there are}} limited symptoms. Admission to the hospital is usually recommended. Oxygen given at a high flow rate may accelerate resorption as much as fourfold.|$|E
5|$|This {{being the}} case, however, {{it appears that}} the genetic {{variability}} of cultivated N. rajah plants <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small,</b> as all commercially available tissue-cultured plants are thought to belong to just four clones originating from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London, England.|$|E

5|$|Tornadoes {{may seem}} rare in {{downtown}} areas because downtown areas cover {{such a small}} geographical area. Considering {{the size of a}} central business district <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> compared to the city limits, tornadoes will strike outside of the downtown area more often.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{striking}} {{differences in}} appearance, S.parthenopion {{may be most}} closely related to S.nicholsi. Like the diminutive S.parthenopion in the Virgin Islands, S.nicholsi, the smallest endemic sphaerodactylid in Puerto Rico, <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small.</b> The geographic range of another species, S.townsendi, divides these two closely related populations, suggesting that S.townsendi evolved after S.parthenopion and S.nicholsi diverged.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in {{practice}} {{one wants to}} approximate the function with {{a finite number of}} terms, say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the trigonometric series, respectively. In the case of the Taylor series the error <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> in a neighbourhood of the point where it is computed, while it may be very large at a distant point. In the case of the Fourier series the error is distributed along the domain of the function.|$|E

5|$|Summer Hill's {{shopping}} precinct is centred {{around a}} small town square with good pedestrian access, and is surrounded by cafés and restaurants along Lackey and Smith Streets. The suburb <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> by Australian standards, having a population of just over 6000, {{in an area of}} 110 hectares. It features some fine examples of architecture from the 19th and early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The canyon {{was most}} likely formed by San Diego Creek cutting through the rising San Joaquin Hills over a span of about 1.22 million years. At some point, however, the creek changed course, and the water gap it had formed was walled off by the {{mountains}} and became a separate watershed. The gradient of the drainage divide separating Laguna Canyon and the San Diego Creek watershed <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small,</b> allowing for the canyon's modern use as a transportation route.|$|E
5|$|The effect <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> but {{measurable}} on Earth {{using the}} Mössbauer effect and was first {{observed in the}} Pound–Rebka experiment. However, it is significant near a black hole, and as an object approaches the event horizon the red shift becomes infinite. It is also the dominant cause of large angular-scale temperature fluctuations in {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (see Sachs-Wolfe effect).|$|E

5|$|The {{rarefaction}} {{is reflected}} off the sloping end {{wall of the}} clarinet mouthpiece. The opening between the reed and the mouthpiece makes very little difference to {{the reflection of the}} rarefaction wave. This is because the opening <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> compared {{to the size of the}} tube, so almost the entire wave is reflected back down the tube even if the reed is completely open at the time the wave hits (image 3).|$|E
5|$|The subfamilies {{are shown}} below; a few genera, mostly fossil, are of {{uncertain}} or basal position. The fossil record of antlions <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> by neuropteran standards. However, some Mesozoic fossils {{attest to the}} antlions' origin more than 150 million years ago. These were at one time separated as the Palaeoleontidae, but are now usually recognized as early antlions.|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} the vulcanoid zone <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> {{compared}} to that of the asteroid belt. Collisions between objects in the vulcanoid zone would be frequent and highly energetic, tending to lead to the destruction of the objects. The most favourable location for vulcanoids is probably in circular orbits near {{the outer edge of the}} vulcanoid zone. Vulcanoids are unlikely to have inclinations of more than about 10° to the ecliptic. Mercury trojans, asteroids trapped in Mercury's Lagrange points, are also possible.|$|E

5|$|Under the Köppen climate {{classification}} system, Manila has {{a tropical}} savanna climate (Köppen climate classification Aw). Together {{with the rest}} of the Philippines, Manila lies entirely within the tropics. Its proximity to the equator means that the temperature range <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small,</b> rarely going below 20°C or above 38°C. Temperature extremes have ranged from 14.5°C on January 11, 1914, to 38.6°C on May 7, 1915.|$|E
5|$|When {{people with}} active {{pulmonary}} TB cough, sneeze, speak, sing, or spit, they expel infectious aerosol droplets 0.5 to 5.0 µm in diameter. A single sneeze can release up to 40,000 droplets. Each {{one of these}} droplets may transmit the disease, since the infectious dose of tuberculosis <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> (the inhalation of fewer than 10 bacteria may cause an infection).|$|E
5|$|When the allele {{frequency}} <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small,</b> drift can also overpower selection even in large populations. For example, while disadvantageous mutations are usually eliminated quickly in large populations, new advantageous mutations {{are almost as}} vulnerable to loss through genetic drift as are neutral mutations. Not until the {{allele frequency}} for the advantageous mutation reaches a certain threshold will genetic drift have no effect.|$|E

5|$|While totally {{dominating}} the region's production, sparkling Champagne {{is not the}} only product that is made from the region's grapes. Non-sparkling still wines, like those made around the village Bouzy, are sold under the appellation label Coteaux Champenois. There is also a rosé appellation in the region, Rosé des Riceys. The regional vin de liqueur is called Ratafia de Champagne. Since the profit of making sparkling Champagne from the region's grape is now much higher, production of these non-sparkling wines and fortified wines <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the adult}} fish, the four {{chambers}} are not {{arranged in a}} straight row but, instead form an S-shape with the latter two chambers lying above the former two. This relatively simpler pattern is found in cartilaginous fish and in the ray-finned fish. In teleosts, the conus arteriosus <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> and can more accurately be described {{as part of the}} aorta rather than of the heart proper. The conus arteriosus is not present in any amniotes, presumably having been absorbed into the ventricles over the course of evolution. Similarly, while the sinus venosus is present as a vestigial structure in some reptiles and birds, it is otherwise absorbed into the right atrium and is no longer distinguishable.|$|E
5|$|Jersey is {{the only}} place in the British Isles where the agile frog Rana dalmatina is found. The {{remaining}} population of agile frogs on Jersey <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> and is restricted to the south west of the island. The species is the subject of an ongoing programme to save it from extinction in Jersey via a collaboration between States of Jersey, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and Jersey Amphibian and Reptile Group (JARG), with support and sponsorship from several other organisations. The programme includes captive breeding and release, public awareness and habitat restoration activities.|$|E
