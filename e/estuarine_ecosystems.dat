50|$|<b>Estuarine</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are {{fundamentally}} important and {{necessary to protect}} through the management of freshwater inflow because of the many ecosystem services they produce. An ecosystem service is something provided by nature that is of value to humans. <b>Estuarine</b> <b>ecosystems</b> {{are among the most}} productive ecosystems on the planet. Estuaries house such species as the blue crab, red fish, flounder, spotted seatrout, and many others for some point of the species’ life cycle. Marine habitats, such as those found in <b>estuarine</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> are valued at providing an estimated US14$ trillion worth of ecosystem goods and services annually, or 43% of the global total. Some economically important estuarine habitats include tidal flats, salt marshes, sea grass beds, oyster reefs, and mangroves. This is why estuaries are important to protect and conserve.|$|E

50|$|Freshwater inflow: Freshwater {{flows into}} an estuary and mixes with the marine {{water of the}} <b>estuarine</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> The mixing of {{freshwater}} inflow and the marine water of the <b>estuarine</b> <b>ecosystem</b> occurs spatially and temporally from climatic influences including tidal action, seasonal variability and storms.

Tides are defined as the periodic {{rise and fall of the}} surface of the sea along the coast that are driven by the gravitational pull of the moon and of the sun. Although estuaries are influenced by the tides, they are often somewhat protected from storms and tidal action by buffers further offshore including barrier islands and peninsulas.|$|R

40|$|In {{developing}} {{a useful tool}} to detect parasitic dynamics in an <b>estuarine</b> <b>ecosystem,</b> a denaturing high-performance liquid chroma-tography (DHPLC) assay was optimized by cloning plasmid DNA from the grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio, and its two para-sites, the trematode Microphallus turgidus and bopyrid isopod Probopyrus pandalicola. The optimal separation condition was an oven temperature of 57. 9 °C and 62 - 68 % of buffer B gradient at a flow rate of 0. 45 mL/min.

50|$|Global changes caused {{largely by}} {{anthropogenic}} influences, or human impacts, are altering {{the amount of}} freshwater inflows to estuaries. Humans are diverting water from rivers and streams, decreasing the amount of flows making it to <b>estuarine</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Since the 1960s dewatering, or removal of water from streams and rivers, has doubled and around 60% of the Earth’s runoff is captured. The removal of freshwater from rivers and streams for anthropogenic use before it reaches the coast is having {{a negative impact on}} many estuaries. Half of the world’s major cities are within 50 km of the coast, and coastal populations are 2.6 times denser than those further inland. Technological advances in the collection of freshwater is continually improving, further straining available freshwater resources. As the human population grows and the strain on water resources continues, the ability to effectively manage freshwater inflows into estuaries is becoming a priority worldwide.|$|E
50|$|The low-salinity {{conditions}} of the marine water are created when freshwater mixes with the saltwater of the estuarine system. Average salinity for freshwater is around 0.5 parts per thousand (ppt) whereas average salinity of the ocean is 35 ppt. The salinity will not be consistent throughout a particular estuary and will be differ from one estuary to the next but its level will range from 0.5 ppt to 35 ppt. In estuaries, primary producers take up nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Freshwater inflows carry estuaries, replenishing the stock for phytoplankton use. Sediments settling out and form banks, offshore peninsulas, and barrier islands that protect the estuary from strong tidal action and currents. The sediment also supports beaches and provision the inter-tidal wetlands. Organic material delivered to estuaries by freshwater inflows the primary energy source for organisms living in the estuary. <b>Estuarine</b> <b>ecosystems</b> need freshwater inflow to maintain their productivity, or to continue to produce biomass.|$|E
5000|$|Air {{pollution}} {{research in}} relation to critical loads has focused on nitrogen and sulfur pollutants. After these pollutants are emitted into the atmosphere, they are subsequently deposited into ecosystems.  Both sulfur and nitrogen deposition can acidify surface waters and soils.  As added acidity lowers the pH of water, fish and invertebrate health are negatively impacted.  Sulfur and nitrogen, as acidifying agents, may change soil nutrient content by removing calcium and releasing toxic aluminum, further impacting plants and animals.  Nitrogen deposition can also act as a fertilizer in the environment and alter the competitive interactions of plants, thereby favoring the growth of some plant species and inhibiting others, potentially leading to changes in species composition and abundance.  The deposition of nitrogen contributes to nutrient enrichment in freshwater, coastal, and <b>estuarine</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> which may cause toxic algal blooms, fish kills, and loss of biodiversity.  Air pollutants impact essential ecosystem services such as air and water purification, decomposition and detoxification of waste materials, and climate regulation.|$|E

Although the chapters deal specifically with <b>estuarine</b> and coastal <b>ecosystems,</b> most of the concepts and conclusions apply to other interface ecosystems as well. Many of the tools (long-term monitoring, stable isotopes, and metabolic balances) or concepts (invading species, connectivity, and ecosystem engineering) have value beyond the systems being discussed here.
