25|$|The Asian <b>giant</b> <b>hornet</b> is {{intensely}} predatory; it hunts medium- to large-sized insects, such as bees, other hornet species, and mantises. The {{latter are}} favoured targets {{in late summer}} and fall. Large insects like Mantises are key protein sources for hornet species including <b>Giant</b> <b>hornet</b> to feed their queen and drone larvae.|$|E
25|$|Each year in Japan, {{the human}} death toll caused by Asian <b>giant</b> <b>hornet</b> stings is around 30 to 40.|$|E
25|$|This complex apparatus, {{including}} the barbs on the sting, {{is thought to}} have evolved specifically in response to predation by vertebrates, as the barbs do not usually function (and the sting apparatus does not detach) unless the sting is embedded in fleshy tissue. While the sting can also penetrate the membranes between joints in the exoskeleton of other insects (and is used in fights between queens), in the case of Apis cerana japonica, defense against larger insects such as predatory wasps (e.g. Asian <b>giant</b> <b>hornet)</b> is usually performed by surrounding the intruder with a mass of defending worker bees, which vibrate their muscles vigorously to raise the temperature of the intruder to a lethal level ("balling"). Previously, heat alone was thought to be responsible for killing intruding wasps, but recent experiments have demonstrated the increased temperature in combination with increased carbon dioxide levels within the ball produce the lethal effect. This phenomenon is also used to kill a queen perceived as intruding or defective, an action known to beekeepers as 'balling the queen', named for the ball of bees formed.|$|E

25|$|Asian <b>giant</b> <b>hornets,</b> Vespa mandarinia, form similar raiding {{parties to}} hunt their prey, which usually {{consists}} of honeybees. The <b>giant</b> <b>hornets</b> group together {{and as a}} team can decimate an entire honeybee colony, especially those of non-native European honeybees. Alone, the hornets are subject to attack by the smaller bees, who swarm the hornet and vibrate their abdomens to generate heat, collectively cooking the hornet until it dies. By hunting in groups, the hornets avoid this problem.|$|R
50|$|Although {{a handful}} of Asian <b>giant</b> <b>hornets</b> can easily defeat the uncoordinated {{defenses}} of a honey bee colony, the Japanese honey bee (Apis cerana japonica) has an effective strategy.|$|R
500|$|While wasp stings deter many {{potential}} predators, bee-eaters (in the bird family Meropidae) specialise in eating stinging insects, making aerial sallies from a perch to catch them, and removing the venom from the stinger by repeatedly brushing the prey firmly against a hard object, {{such as a}} twig. The honey buzzard attacks the nests of social hymenopterans, eating wasp larvae; {{it is the only}} known predator of the dangerous Asian <b>giant</b> <b>hornet</b> or [...] "yak-killer" [...] (Vespa mandarinia). Likewise, Roadrunners are the only real predators of tarantula hawk wasps.|$|E
500|$|Wasps first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Jurassic, and diversified into many surviving superfamilies by the Cretaceous. They are a successful and diverse group of insects {{with tens of thousands of}} described species; wasps have spread to all parts of the world except for the polar regions. The largest social wasp is the Asian <b>giant</b> <b>hornet,</b> at up to [...] in length; among the largest solitary wasps is a group of species known as tarantula hawks, along with the giant scoliid of Indonesia (Megascolia procer). The smallest wasps are solitary chalcid wasps in the family Mymaridae, including the world's smallest known insect, with a body length of only , and the smallest known flying insect, only [...] long.|$|E
500|$|The largest social wasp is the Asian <b>giant</b> <b>hornet,</b> {{at up to}} [...] in length. The various {{tarantula}} hawk wasps are of {{a similar}} size and can overpower a spider many times its own weight, and move it to its burrow, with a sting that is excruciatingly painful to humans. The solitary giant scoliid, Megascolia procer, with a wingspan of 11.5cm, has subspecies in Sumatra and Java; it is a parasitoid of the Atlas beetle Chalcosoma atlas. The female giant ichneumon wasp Megarhyssa macrurus is [...] long including its very long but slender ovipositor which is used for boring into wood and inserting eggs. The smallest wasps are solitary chalcid wasps in the family Mymaridae, including the world's smallest known insect, Dicopomorpha echmepterygis (139 micrometres long) and Kikiki huna with a body length of only 158 micrometres, the smallest known flying insect.|$|E

2500|$|The Asian <b>giant</b> <b>hornet</b> (Vespa mandarinia), {{including}} the subspecies Japanese <b>giant</b> <b>hornet</b> (V. m. japonica), colloquially {{known as the}} yak-killer hornet, is the world's largest hornet, native to temperate and tropical Eastern Asia. They prefer to live in low mountains and forests, while almost completely avoiding plains and high-altitude climates. V. mandarinia creates nests by digging, co-opting pre-existing tunnels dug by rodents, or occupying spaces near rotted pine roots. It feeds primarily on larger insects, colonies of other eusocial insects, tree sap, and honey from honey bee colonies. Some dimensions of this hornet are a body length of , a wingspan around , and stinger length of [...] which injects {{a large amount of}} potent venom.|$|E
2500|$|The stinger of the Asian <b>giant</b> <b>hornet</b> {{is about}} [...] long, and injects an {{especially}} potent venom that contains, like many bee and wasp venoms, a cytolytic peptide (specifically, a mastoparan) that can damage tissue by stimulating phospholipase action, {{in addition to}} its own phospholipase.|$|E
2500|$|The eyes of V. crabro {{are deeply}} {{indented}} and {{shaped like a}} [...] "C". Its wings are reddish-orange, while the petiolate abdomen is striped with brown and yellow. It has hair on the thorax and abdomen, although the European hornet is not as hairy as most bees. Typical mass size for the European Hornet is 477.5+/-59.9mg. Due to this coloration and abdomen pattern, V. crabro is often mistaken for the Asian <b>giant</b> <b>hornet.</b> In size, the European hornet, at 25–35mm long, {{is larger than the}} common wasp, but smaller than the Asian <b>giant</b> <b>hornet.</b> Females are typically larger than males in both size and mass. However, male abdomens have seven segments, whereas female abdomens have six. Only females possess an ovipositor (modified to form a stinger), and males cannot sting. The antennae of males are slightly longer, with 13 segments compared to 12 segments in females.|$|E

5000|$|The venom of Vespa luctuosa has {{the highest}} {{recorded}} toxicity to mice of any wasp species tested. The [...] of the venom is 1.6 mg/kg. The toxicity (measured against mice) per weight of Vespa luctuosa venom is {{higher than that of}} the Japanese <b>giant</b> <b>hornet</b> (Vespa mandarinia japonica), which has an LD50 of 4.0 mg/kg, but which is responsible for many more human deaths than Vespa luctuosa. The greater lethality of Japanese <b>giant</b> <b>hornet</b> stings—as well as the closely related Asian <b>giant</b> <b>hornet</b> (Vespa mandarinia)—results from a considerably larger volume of venom being injected per sting.|$|E
5000|$|The Japanese <b>giant</b> <b>hornet</b> (Vespa mandarinia japonica) is a {{subspecies}} of the world's largest hornet, the Asian <b>giant</b> <b>hornet</b> (V. mandarinia).

50|$|Due to {{the great}} scale of the swarm and {{aggressiveness}} of the yellow hornet, predation against yellow hornet by other hornet species are rare. However, along with other insects in Japan and Korea, they are prey to the Asian <b>giant</b> <b>hornet.</b> Since this predator is prey to the much bigger hornet, its nests {{have been known to}} be deserted after <b>giant</b> <b>hornet</b> attacks. The yellow hornet only attacks when their chance comes as they outnumber their giant enemy, which attacks yellow hornet colonies in smaller groups of 10 to 30.|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{identified a}} novel insect picorna-like virus, termed Kakugo virus (KV), {{obtained from the}} brains of aggressive honeybee worker bees that had counterattacked <b>giant</b> <b>hornets.</b> Here we examined the tissue distribution of KV and alterations of gene expression profiles in the brains of KV-infected worker bees to analyze possible effects of KV infection on honeybee neural and physiological states. By use of in situ hybridization, KV was broadly detected in the brains of the naturally KV-infected worker bees. When inoculated experimentally into bees, KV was detected in restricted {{parts of the brain}} at the early infectious stage and was later detected in various brain regions, including the mushroom bodies, optic lobes, and ocellar nerve. KV was detected not only in the brain but also in the hypopharyngeal glands and fat bodies, indicating systemic KV infection. Next, we compared the gene expression profiles in the brains of KV-inoculated and noninoculated bees. The expression of 11 genes examined was not significantly affected in KV-infected worker bees. cDNA microarray analysis, however, identified a novel gene whose expression was induced in the periphery of the brains of KV-infected bees, which was commonly observed in naturally infected and experimentally inoculated bees. The gene encoded a novel hypothetical protein with a leucine zipper motif. A gene encoding a similar protein was found in the parasitic wasp Nasonia genome but not in other insect genomes. These findings suggest that KV infection may affect brain functions and/or physiological states in honeybees...|$|R
2500|$|Beekeepers in Japan {{attempted}} to introduce western honey bees (Apis mellifera) {{for the sake}} of their high productivity. European honeybees have no innate defense against the hornets, which can rapidly destroy their colonies. Although a handful of Asian <b>giant</b> <b>hornets</b> can easily defeat the uncoordinated defenses of a honeybee colony, the Japanese honeybee (Apis cerana japonica) has an effective strategy. When a hornet scout locates and approaches a Japanese honeybee hive, she emits specific pheromonal hunting signals. When the Japanese honeybees detect these pheromones, a hundred or so gather near the entrance of the nest and set up a trap, keeping the entrance open. This permits the hornet to enter the hive. As the hornet enters, a mob of hundreds of bees surrounds it in a ball, completely covering it and preventing it from reacting effectively. The bees violently vibrate their flight muscles {{in much the same way}} as they do to heat the hive in cold conditions. This raises the temperature in the ball to the critical temperature of [...] In addition, the exertions of the honeybees raise the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ball. At that concentration of CO2, they can tolerate up to , but the hornet cannot survive the combination of high a temperature and high carbon dioxide level. Some bees do die along with the intruder, much as happens when they attack other intruders with their stings, but by killing the hornet scout, they prevent it from summoning reinforcements that would wipe out the entire colony.|$|R
