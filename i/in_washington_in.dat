During a visit to Los Angeles in 1945, he handed it over to the Huntington Library, where it was stored in a bomb-proof vault. The library revealed the existence of the document in 1999, and sent it on permanent loan to the Skirball Cultural Center, which placed it on public display.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, after the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and {{the ban on}} hunting Killer Whales <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>in</b> 1976 as {{discussed}} later in this article, the hunting of Killer Whales in Iceland resumed, this time aiming to capture live animals for the entertainment industry. The first two Killer Whales captured went to Dolfinarium Harderwijk in the Netherlands. One of these animals was soon after transferred to SeaWorld. These captures continued until 1989, with the additional animals going to SeaWorld, Marineland Antibes, Marineland Canada, Kamogawa Sea World, Ocean Park Hong Kong and Conny-Land.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{to undertake a}} cross-channel invasion of continental Europe {{within the next year}} was taken at the Trident Conference, held <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>in</b> May 1943.

5|$|There was a seat vacant on the U.S. Supreme Court in 1889, and Governor Foraker {{suggested}} President Harrison appoint Taft to fill it. Taft was 32 and {{his professional}} goal {{was always a}} seat on the Supreme Court. He actively sought the appointment, writing to Foraker to urge the governor to press his case, while stating to others it was unlikely he would get it. Instead, in 1890, Harrison appointed him Solicitor General of the United States. When Taft arrived <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>in</b> February 1890, the office had been vacant two months, with the work piling up. He worked to eliminate the backlog, while simultaneously educating himself on federal law and procedure he had not needed as an Ohio state judge.|$|E
5|$|Arriving <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>in</b> October 1861, the {{regiment}} spent the following winter in camp at Hall's Hill, near Arlington in Virginia. It {{became part of}} the Army of the Potomac, with which it would be associated for its entire term of service. The regiment saw its first action during the Siege of Yorktown in April 1862. It was involved in the Peninsular Campaign, particularly the Battle of Gaines' Mill during which it suffered its worst casualties (numerically) of the war. Their worst casualties in terms of percentages took place during the Battle of Gettysburg (60 percent). The 22nd Massachusetts was present for virtually all of the major battles in which the Army of the Potomac fought, including the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Antietam, the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Battle of Gettysburg and Lieutenant General Ulysses Grant's Overland Campaign. The 22nd was especially proficient in skirmish drill and was frequently deployed in that capacity throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|Attendees at the Trident Conference <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>in</b> May 1943 {{took the}} {{decision}} to launch a cross-Channel invasion within the next year. Churchill favoured making the main Allied thrust into Germany from the Mediterranean theatre, but his American allies, who were providing {{the bulk of the}} men and equipment, over-ruled him. British Lieutenant-General Frederick E. Morgan was appointed Chief of Staff, Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC), to begin detailed planning. The initial plans were constrained by the number of available landing-craft, most of which were already committed in the Mediterranean and in the Pacific. In part because of lessons learned in the Dieppe Raid of 19 August 1942, the Allies decided not to directly assault a heavily defended French seaport in their first landing. The failure at Dieppe also highlighted the need for adequate artillery and air support, particularly close air support, and specialised ships able to travel extremely close to shore. The short operating-range of British aircraft such as the Spitfire and Typhoon greatly limited the number of potential landing-sites, as comprehensive air-support depended upon having planes overhead for as long as possible. Morgan considered four sites for the landings: Brittany, the Cotentin Peninsula, Normandy, and the Pas de Calais. As Brittany and Cotentin are peninsulas, the Germans could have cut off the Allied advance at a relatively narrow isthmus, so these sites were rejected.|$|E

5|$|Her {{paintings}} were a profitable source of income. According to her daughter-in-law, Olga preferred to exhibit in Denmark {{to avoid the}} commercialism of the North American market. The Russian Relief Programme, which was founded by Tikhon and his third wife Olga in honour of the Grand Duchess, exhibited a selection of her work at the residence of the Russian ambassador <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>in</b> 2001, in Moscow in 2002, in Ekaterinburg in 2004, in Saint Petersburg and Moscow in 2005, in Tyumen and Surgut in 2006, at the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow and Saint Michael's Castle in Saint Petersburg in 2007, and at the Vladimir Arsenyev Museum in Vladivostok in 2013. Pieces by Olga {{are included in the}} collections of Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, King Harald of Norway, and private collections in North America and Europe. Ballerup Museum in Pederstrup, Denmark, has around 100 of her works.|$|E
5|$|Instead of an {{immediate}} return to France, the Western Allies staged offensives in the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations, where British troops were already stationed. By mid-1943 {{the campaign in}} North Africa had been won. The Allies then launched the invasion of Sicily in July 1943, and subsequently invaded Italy in September the same year. By then, Soviet forces were on the offensive and had won a major victory at the Battle of Stalingrad. The decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion {{within the next year}} was taken at the Trident Conference <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>in</b> May 1943. Initial planning was constrained by the number of available landing craft, most of which were already committed in the Mediterranean and Pacific. At the Tehran Conference in November 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill promised Stalin that they would open the long-delayed second front in May 1944.|$|E
5|$|Josepha Petrick began {{painting}} about 1990 or 1992 {{as part of}} {{the contemporary}} Indigenous art movement that had begun at Papunya in the 1970s. By 1998 her work was being collected by both private and public institutions, such as Charles Sturt University, and in 2005 a work was purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria. Her career received a significant boost when her work was included in the National Gallery of Victoria's 2006 Landmarks exhibition and its catalogue; her painting was printed opposite that of Yannima Tommy Watson, who was by this time famous, particularly for his contribution to the design of a new building for the Musée du quai Branly. Petrick's paintings have been included at exhibitions in several private galleries in Melbourne and Hong Kong, {{as well as at the}} Australian embassy <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>in</b> 2001.|$|E

5|$|Leslie Richard Groves Jr. {{was born}} in Albany, New York, on 17 August 1896, the third son of four {{children}} of a pastor, Leslie Richard Groves Sr., and his wife Gwen née Griffith. A descendant of French Huguenots who came to America in the 17th century, Leslie Groves Sr. resigned as pastor of the Sixth Presbyterian church in Albany in December 1896 to become a United States Army chaplain. He was posted to the 14th Infantry at Vancouver Barracks <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>in</b> 1897. Following {{the outbreak of the}} Spanish–American War in 1898, Chaplain Groves was sent to Cuba with the 8th Infantry. On returning to Vancouver Barracks, he was ordered to rejoin the 14th Infantry in the Philippines; service in the Philippine–American War and the Boxer Rebellion followed. The 14th Infantry returned to the United States in 1901 and moved to Fort Snelling, Minnesota. The family relocated to there from Vancouver, then moved to Fort Hancock, New Jersey, the next year, and returned to Vancouver in 1905. Chaplain Groves was hospitalized with tuberculosis at Fort Bayard in 1905. He decided to settle in southern California and bought a house in Altadena. His next posting was to Fort Apache, Arizona. The family spent their summers there and returned to Altadena where the children attended school.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Australia, Jackson {{filled a}} number of staff positions, {{including}} postings to the Royal Military College, Army Headquarters and Headquarters Western Command.

On 21 June 1956, Jackson assumed command of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) in South Korea deployed {{as part of the}} UN garrison which had remained there following the end of the Korean War and oversaw the battalion's final operational activities before its return to Australia. He subsequently took up a two-year appointment in the United States as Australian Military Attache <b>in</b> <b>Washington.</b> <b>In</b> 1959 he was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in recognition of his service to the Australian Staff Corps.|$|E
5|$|Struggling {{to fit in}} at Howard, {{unable to}} make tenure, and with {{concerns}} about the increasing crime rates <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> <b>in</b> 1977 the family decided to move once again, this time to Athens, Georgia. Shortly after the move Jarrell became {{an assistant professor at}} the University of Georgia. He and his wife started a high-end educational toy company that stemmed from their children's love for similar toys when living in Washington, D.C.. They opened a small shop called Tadpole Toys and Hobby Center in Athens to great reception. However, as a result of poor sales in May1982 they were forced to close it. Soon afterwards, Jarrell received tenure at the University. In 1988, he retired from his position and from teaching as a whole in order to focus on his creative work. By 1994 all three children were grown; the two daughters attended the Art Institute of Chicago, and Wadsworth Jr. became a seafarer. That year, Jae and daughter Jennifer moved to New York {{to find a place to}} live, settling in SoHo, where they were joined by Jarrell a few months later. Currently, Jarrell and Jae live and work in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E

Eisenhower was appointed commander of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), and General Bernard Montgomery was named as commander of the 21st Army Group, which comprised all the land forces involved in the invasion. The coast of Normandy {{was chosen as the}} site of the invasion, with the Americans assigned to land at sectors codenamed Utah and Omaha, the British at Sword and Gold, and the Canadians at Juno. To meet the conditions expected on the Normandy beachhead, special technology was developed, including two artificial ports called Mulberry harbours and an array of specialised tanks nicknamed Hobart's Funnies. In {{the months leading up to}} the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial military deception, Operation Bodyguard, using both electronic and visual misinformation. This misled the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in charge of developing fortifications all along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an invasion.|$|E
5|$|When the United States {{took over}} the Philippine Islands from the Spanish in 1898 after the Spanish–American War, President William McKinley began Americanizing the former Spanish colony. In 1900 he {{appointed}} William Howard Taft to head the Philippine Commission to evaluate {{the needs of the}} new territory. Taft, who later became the Philippines' first civilian Governor-General, decided that Manila, the capital, should be a planned town. He hired as his architect and city planner Daniel Hudson Burnham, who had built Union Station and the Postal Square Building <b>in</b> <b>Washington.</b> <b>In</b> Manila, Burnham had in mind a long wide, tree-lined boulevard along the bay, beginning at a park area dominated by a magnificent hotel. To execute Burnham's plans, Taft hired William E. Parsons, a New York City architect, who envisioned an impressive, comfortable hotel along the lines of a California mission but grander. The original design was an H-shaped plan that focused on well-ventilated rooms on two wings, providing grand vistas of the harbor, the Luneta, and Intramuros. The top floor was, in fact, a large viewing deck that was used for various functions, including watching the American navy steam into the harbor.|$|E
5|$|White {{became a}} member of Hui Aloha ʻĀina oNa Kane (Hawaiian Patriotic League for Men), a {{patriotic}} group founded shortly after the overthrow of the monarchy to oppose annexation and support the deposed queen. A corresponding female league was also founded. The ranks of the men's group were largely composed of the leading native politicians of the former monarchy, including Nāwahī, who served as its president. A delegation (not including White) was elected by its members to represent the case of the monarchy and the Hawaiian people to the United States Commissioner James Henderson Blount sent by President Grover Cleveland to investigate the overthrow. During this politically uncertain time, White traveled to Honolulu at the end of 1893 on the steamer W.G. Hall upon hearing rumors of the monarchy's restoration and returned to Lahaina in January when he discovered the reports were false. The native resistance, the results of the Blount Report, and President Cleveland's refusal to annex the island stopped the annexationist scheme and prompted the Provisional Government to establish an oligarchical government, styling itself the Republic of Hawaii, until a more favorable political climate emerged <b>in</b> <b>Washington.</b> <b>In</b> April 1894 White and John Richardson gave a speech at Lahaina opposing the new regime and asking the people not to participate in the election of delegates to the constitutional convention in Honolulu. Members of Hui Aloha ʻĀina gave speeches and held meetings across much of the island, and it was reported that foreigners and natives alike in Maui (with the exception of the residents of Hana) were strongly against the attempts to establish a republic.|$|E
