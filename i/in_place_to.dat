5|$|Four months later, in May 2005, {{a second}} spike {{had to be}} cut off by firefighters after it was {{discovered}} hanging loose. At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public, and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed. As a result, some of the joints were re-welded, with equipment put <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> prevent excessive movement. This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 70% of the spikes' weights.|$|E

5|$|Most of the three-mile (5km) {{stretch of}} river that had {{previously}} been closed was reopened without restriction, although a patrol remained <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> enforce a safety zone. The river restrictions delayed one outgoing vessel and two incoming ones. There was also a minor oil spill originating from equipment at the refinery's unoccupied and rarely used dock.|$|E
5|$|Substantial {{sections}} of the Kolonnenweg remain <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> serve as farm and forestry access roads, though the accompanying anti-vehicle ditches, fences and other obstacles have been almost entirely removed.

5|$|When Franklin and Providence/Stoughton service {{returned}} to the main line, service on the Midland had become popular enough to justify a continued shuttle service along the line from Boston to Fairmount. The Fairmount Shuttle was extended to Readville on November 30, 1987 as the Fairmount Line. Since 1987, Providence/Stoughton Line service has run through Readville without making a station stop, {{even though there are}} platforms <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> allow such use.|$|E

She believed in [...] "the life-enhancing virtues of pure earth, clean air and blue sky." [...] In 1883, she wrote: There is perhaps no need of the poor of London which more prominently forces itself on the notice of anyone working among them than that of space. ... How can it best be given? And what is it precisely which should be given? I think we want four things. <b>Places</b> <b>to</b> sit <b>in,</b> <b>places</b> <b>to</b> play <b>in,</b> <b>places</b> <b>to</b> stroll <b>in,</b> and <b>places</b> <b>to</b> spend a day in. The preservation of Wimbledon and Epping shows that the need is increasingly recognised. But a visit to Wimbledon, Epping, or Windsormeans for the workman not only the cost of the journey but the loss of a whole day's wages; we want, besides, places where the long summer evenings or the Saturday afternoon may be enjoyed without effort or expense.|$|R

5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> <b>to</b> prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E
5|$|Although the {{accident}} investigation found that procedures and policies were supposedly already <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> prevent such a crash from occurring again, {{the fact that}} this crash occurred showed that in at least one instance, the existing safety policies and their enforcement had been grievously inadequate. To re-emphasize the importance of adherence to existing safety policies and correcting the actions of anyone violating them at any time, the USAF quickly distributed the findings of {{the accident}} investigation throughout the service. These measures failed to prevent – sixteen years later – the occurrence in almost identical circumstances of another accident, when a C-17 transport aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, on an aerial-display practice flight.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conservation}} {{concern was}} made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided {{it was not necessary}} to enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on the British Columbia Coast and the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats. A legal and scientific nonprofit organization, Ecojustice, led the lawsuit and represented the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, Greenpeace Canada, International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and the Wilderness Committee. Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 killer whales on the British Columbia Coast in danger.|$|E

5|$|At {{the height}} of the revolt, Hananu {{effectively}} created a quasi-independent state between Aleppo and the Mediterranean Sea. Hananu's rebels first began administering captured territory in Armanaz, where the rebels coordinated with that town's municipality to impose taxes on landowners, livestock owners and farmers to fund their operations. From there, Hananu's administrative territory expanded to other towns and villages, including Kafr Takharim, and the district centers Harim, Jisr al-Shughur and Idlib. The municipal councils of these towns were not replaced, but repurposed to support the financial needs of the rebels and promote their social convictions. Kafr Takharim became the legislative center of rebel territory with a legislative committee <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> collect money and weapons from local sources, and a supreme revolutionary council to oversee judicial matters.|$|E
5|$|Barquq was {{restored}} {{to power in}} 1390, after which the Turkmen tribesmen raided the hills around Beirut once more, although {{they were unable to}} capture the villages of Ainab and Aramoun. Under Barquq's direction, the Mamluks mobilized their army troops, Druze warriors, and tribesmen from the Beqaa Valley and dealt a heavy blow against the Turkmens of Keserwan. Nonetheless, Barquq decided to keep the Turkmen emirs as the lords of Keserwan, albeit in a weakened state. Barquq likely kept the Turkmens <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> avoid giving the Buhturids too much power in Mount Lebanon or to avoid over-extending Buhturid forces. According to Salibi, only four Turkmen emirs have been named in primary sources: a certain Sa'id who ruled in 1361, his brother and successor Isa, and a certain Ali ibn al-A'ma and his brother Umar ibn al-A'ma. The latter two were the Turkmen emirs involved in the rebellion against Barquq. Ali was killed in Barquq's punitive expedition, while Umar was imprisoned and released.|$|E
5|$|By 1994, {{the tram}} {{route to the}} new {{hospital}} appeared to have political support, but by 1996 local politicians instead wanted to use Gaustad Station and buses to serve the hospital. There also arose a disagreement between {{the city and the}} state as to who should be paying for the light rail line, should it should be built. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August. With the opening, line 4 was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsarken, to Ullevål stadion. There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too much noise, and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built. On 20 August 2003, the Ring Line of the metro opened, and line 4 started to also serve Nydalen and Storo.|$|E

5|$|Civilian {{telephones}} {{were used}} {{at the outset of}} the war, but they were found to be unreliable in the damp, muddy conditions that prevailed. Consequently, the field telephone was designed; a device that operated with its own switchboard. Apart from voice communication, it featured a buzzer unit with a Morse code key, so that it could be used to send and receive coded messages. This facility proved useful when, in the midst of bombardment, exploding shells drowned out voice communication. The telephones were connected by lines that sustained continual damage as a result of shell fire and the movement of troops. The lines were generally buried, with redundant lines set <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> compensate for breakages.|$|E
5|$|Dollo's {{specimens}} {{allowed him}} to show that Owen's prehistoric pachyderms were not correct for Iguanodon. He instead modelled the skeletal mounts after the cassowary and wallaby, and put the spike {{that had been on}} the nose firmly on the thumb. He was not completely correct, but he also had the disadvantage of being faced with some of the first complete dinosaur remains. A problem that was later recognised was the bend he introduced into the tail. This organ was more or less straight, as shown by the skeletons he was excavating, and the presence of ossified tendons. In fact, to get the bend in the tail for a more wallaby or kangaroo-like posture, the tail would have had to be broken. With its correct, straight tail and back, the animal would have walked with its body held horizontal to the ground, arms <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> support the body if needed.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of August16, officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for residents in St. Joseph Peninsula State Park and Stone State Park on Cape San Blas in Gulf County, Florida. Two shelters were opened in Bay County, one at the Dean Bozeman High School and the other at Bozeman Learning Center. Voluntary evacuation orders were also given to residents living in low-lying areas along the coastline. Although no plans were put <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> open shelters, the Emergency Operations Center in Washington County raised their activation level to stage two. In Franklin County, the Emergency Operations Center was placed at stage three and voluntary evacuation orders were issued for Alligator Point. After an afternoon briefing, officials in Walton County declared a State of Emergency based on available information on the storm. In Wakulla County, the American Red Cross opened a shelter in Crawfordville at a local church.|$|E
