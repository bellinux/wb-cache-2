Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, [...] "I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I <b>know</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much.

Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's [...] "Thank You".

2500|$|While {{many critics}} still {{consider}} the word [...] "beat" [...] in its literal sense of [...] "tired and beaten down," [...] others, including Kerouac himself promoted the generation more in sense of [...] "beatific" [...] or blissful. Holmes and Kerouac published several articles in popular magazines {{in an attempt}} to explain the movement. [...] In the November 16, 1952 New York Times Sunday Magazine, he wrote a piece exposing the faces of the Beat Generation. [...] "ne day [...] said, 'You <b>know,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> really beat generation' ... More than mere weariness, it implies the feeling of having been used, of being raw. [...] It involves a sort of nakedness of mind, and ultimately, of soul: [...] a feeling of being reduced to the bedrock of consciousness. [...] In short, it means being undramatically pushed up against the wall of oneself." [...] He distinguishes Beats from the Lost Generation of the 1920s pointing out how the Beats are not lost but how they are searching for answers to all of life's questions. Kerouac's preoccupation with writers like Ernest Hemingway shaped his view of the beat generation. He uses a prose style which he adapted from Hemingway and throughout On the Road he alludes to novels like The Sun Also Rises. [...] "How to live seems much more crucial than why." [...] In many ways, it is a spiritual journey, a quest to find belief, belonging, and meaning in life. [...] Not content with the uniformity promoted by government and consumer culture, the Beats yearned for a deeper, more sensational experience. Holmes expands his attempt to define the generation in a 1958 article in Esquire magazine. This article was able to take more of a look back at the formation of the movement as it was published after On the Road. [...] "It describes the state of mind from which all unessentials have been stripped, leaving it receptive to everything around it, but impatient with trivial obstructions. [...] To be beat is to be at the bottom of your personality, looking up." ...|$|E
