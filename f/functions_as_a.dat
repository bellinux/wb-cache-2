5|$|In {{addition}} to being the primary energy source for plants, light <b>functions</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> signalling device, providing information to the plant, such as how much sunlight the plant receives each day. This can result in adaptive changes in {{a process known as}} photomorphogenesis. Phytochromes are the photoreceptors in a plant that are sensitive to light.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{learning}} {{is the ability}} to refine patterns of body movement by practicing, or more generally by repetition. A number of brain areas are involved, including the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and especially the cerebellum, which <b>functions</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> large memory bank for microadjustments of the parameters of movement.|$|E

5|$|Often, once an {{antibody}} and antigen bind, {{they become}} an immune complex, which <b>functions</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> unitary object and {{can act as}} an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies. Similarly, haptens are small molecules that provoke no immune response by themselves, but once they bind to proteins, the resulting complex or hapten-carrier adduct is antigenic.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs when}} the opening that allows air to enter the pleural space <b>functions</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> one-way valve, allowing more air to enter with every breath but none to escape. The body compensates by increasing the respiratory rate and tidal volume (size of each breath), worsening the problem. Unless corrected, hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels) and respiratory arrest eventually follow.|$|E

50|$|Build in 1858, the {{windmill}} <b>functioned</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> gristmill until 1925, {{after which}} it got into disrepair. The internal machinery was removed in 1950, and in 1958 the exterior was restored to <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> standstill monument. The mill was restored in 1975 to <b>function</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> restaurant. It {{was turned into}} a living space in 1980.

5|$|A hub is able {{to support}} low {{bandwidth}} devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value, PRE. This is required as a USB hub <b>functions</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> very simple repeater, broadcasting the host message to all connected devices regardless if the packet was for it or not. This means in a mixed speed environment, {{there is a potential}} danger that a low speed will misinterpret a high or full speed signal from the host.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the more}} northerly (Bakerloo) part of the station is via the {{original}} building, while the exit is via a new extension next to Skipton House. Between the entrance and two shops is the entrance to South London House, an office block above the station. The BS station building remains much as originally constructed and is a typical Leslie Green structure. The main alteration is a modern glass-sided and glass-topped flat-roofed extension abutting the original western elevation, giving access to three of the six arches. These arches, in a classic deep-red faience style, formed the original perimeter: two are infilled with street-facing shops. As the station also <b>functions</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> drivers' depot, London Underground uses the offices above the station for administration and drivers' accommodation.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the bark}} <b>functions</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{protective}} barrier, it is itself attacked by boring insects such as beetles. These {{lay their eggs}} in crevices and the larvae chew {{their way through the}} cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the tree. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried from one elm tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were killed by this disease.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Riven, Atrus equips the player with a trap book—a snare that <b>functions</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> one-man prison, yet looks identical to a linking book—and his personal diary. This diary summarizes the history of events leading to the present situation; Atrus cannot explain in depth as he is engaged in rewriting the descriptive book of Riven, {{in an attempt to}} slow its deterioration. The player must enter the Age with no way of leaving, as Atrus cannot risk sending a real linking book to Riven until Gehn is safely imprisoned lest he use it to escape Riven. Instructing the player to capture Gehn in the trap book, find Catherine, and then signal him, Atrus holds out the link book that will transport the player to Riven.|$|E
5|$|Boron trifluoride is planar and {{possesses}} {{an incomplete}} octet. It <b>functions</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Lewis acid and combines with Lewis bases like ammonia to form adducts. Carbon tetrafluoride is tetrahedral and inert; its group analogues, silicon and germanium tetrafluoride, are also tetrahedral but behave as Lewis acids. The pnictogens form trifluorides that increase in reactivity and basicity with higher molecular weight, although nitrogen trifluoride resists hydrolysis {{and is not}} basic. The pentafluorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony are more reactive than their respective trifluorides, with antimony pentafluoride the strongest neutral Lewis acid known.|$|E

5|$|Diamond's high thermal {{conductivity}} {{is used by}} jewelers and gemologists who may employ an electronic thermal probe to distinguish diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor <b>functions</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds. However, older probes will be fooled by moissanite, a crystalline mineral form of silicon carbide introduced in 1998 as an alternative to diamonds, which has a similar {{thermal conductivity}}.|$|E

This dates the emergence of dopamine as a neurotransmitter back to the earliest appearance of the nervous system, over 500 million years ago in the Cambrian era. Dopamine <b>functions</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> neurotransmitter in vertebrates, echinoderms, arthropods, molluscs, and several types of worm.|$|E
