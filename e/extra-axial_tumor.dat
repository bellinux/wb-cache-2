40|$|We present six {{cases of}} extra-axial lesions: three meningiomas [including one {{intraventricular}} and one cerebellopontine angle (CPA) meningioma], one dural metastasis, one CPA schwannoma and one choroid plexus papilloma which were chosen {{from a larger}} cohort of <b>extra-axial</b> <b>tumors</b> evaluated in our institution. Apart from conventional MR examinations, all the patients also underwent perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) using dynamic susceptibility contrast method on a 1. 5  T MR unit (contrast: 0. 3  mmol/kg, rate 5  ml/s). Though the presented tumors showed very similar appearance on conventional MR images, they differed significantly in perfusion examinations. The article draws {{special attention to the}} usefulness of PWI in the differentiation of various <b>extra-axial</b> <b>tumors</b> and its contribution in reaching final correct diagnoses. Finding a dural lesion with low perfusion parameters strongly argues against the diagnosis of meningioma and should raise a suspicion of a dural metastasis. In cases of CPA tumors, a lesion with low relative cerebral blood volume values should be suspected to be schwannoma, allowing exclusion of meningioma to be made. In intraventricular tumors arising from choroid plexus, low perfusion parameters can exclude a diagnosis of meningioma. In our opinion, PWI as an easy and quick to perform functional technique should be incorporated into the MR protocol of all intracranial <b>tumors</b> including <b>extra-axial</b> neoplasms...|$|R
40|$|Background. Priority {{objectives}} of surgical neurooncology (diagnosis verification, tumor cytoreduction, {{and preservation of}} patient’s functional status) can be achieved both through traditional neurosurgical approaches and {{through the use of}} keyhole surgery. Keyhole surgery allows to minimize unnecessary, extended resection of the skull base and long-term static brain tissue retraction. Objective. The authors present preliminary results of the use of supraorbital keyhole craniotomy in intra- and <b>extra-axial</b> brain <b>tumors.</b>   Materials and methods. In 2014 – 2016, 45 patients were operated through supraorbital craniotomy to treat intra- and <b>extra-axial</b> <b>tumors.</b> The majority of patients (n = 28) was diagnosed with anterior cranial fossa meningiomas. Gliomas of the frontal lobe were diagnosed in 12 patients. The average tumor size ranged from 3 to 3. 5 cm. Results. Mortality, disability, or serious permanent access-related complications were not observed in our group. In all cases, the transition to the classical craniotomy was not required. Periorbital edema and transient hypoesthesia were observed in all patients. Permanent frontal hypoesthesia was observed in 3 patients (4 %) for a time period up to six months. According to postoperative MRI performed in all patients at the time of discharge, in the group of intra-axial brain tumor gross-total removal was observed in 8 patients (47 %), in 9 patients (53 %) the tumor was near-totally removed (more than 90 % of the tumor), in the group of meningiomas all 28 patients had gross-total removal. Conclusion. Supraorbital craniotomy can be an effective and safe alternative to classic approaches to treatment of <b>extra-axial</b> <b>tumors</b> of the anterior cranial fossa and intra-axial tumors of the frontal lobe. The approach requires a very careful selection of patients, individualization of surgery, and further critical evaluation.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Objective: The aim of {{this report}} is to {{describe}} 3 cases of salivary gland tumors with intracranial extension associated to an extracerebral mass lesion, and to discuss the frequence, pathology and treatment of these very rare localizations. Clinical material: The 3 patients were 1 woman and 2 men, aged 44, 53 and 74 years, respectively. The primary tumors were an adenocarcinoma and a malignant oncocytoma of the parotid gland and an adenoid cystic carcinoma of the submandibular gland. The location of the intradural <b>extra-axial</b> <b>tumor</b> was the middle fossa and temporal region in 2 cases and the cerebellopontine angle in 1. Surgical treatment consisted in the seemingly complete removal of 2 tumors with middle fossa localization and partial removal of the cerebellopontine angle lesion. Radiotherapy was administered in all 3 cases and chemotherapy in 2. Results: 1 patient is alive and free of recurrence 32 months after removal of the intracranial tumor; 2 other patients died 28 months and 12 months postoperatively. Conclusions: The intracranial extension of salivary gland tumors is a very rare event.

This work was conducted {{on the basis of the}} assumption that, in the presence of intra-axial and <b>extra-axial</b> brain <b>tumors,</b> the white matter involved by the edema is a site of metabolic change that involves the structure of the myelin sheath. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients comprised our cohort affected by intra-axial and <b>extra-axial</b> cerebral <b>tumors</b> with a peritumoral T 2 -weighted MR signal hyperintensity as a result of edema, where MR spectroscopy showed no increase in choline-containing compounds. Measurements on proton MR spectroscopy (1 H-MR spectroscopy) were performed with a 3 T whole-body scanner with use of a point-resolved spectroscopy sequence for localization (TR, 2000 ms; TE, 35 ms), and the metabolites were quantified with the SAGE method. Peak intensities of the main metabolites were expressed as ratios of one another and were compared with values obtained in the white matter of the left frontal region in a control group of 16 healthy volunteers.

40|$|The p 53 tumor {{suppressor}} gene is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer; this gene is mutated in up to 50 % of human tumors. It has {{a critical role in}} the cell cycle, apoptosis and cell senescence, and it participates in many crucial physiological and pathological processes. Polymorphisms of p 53 have been suggested to be associated with genetically determined susceptibility in various types of cancer. Another process involved with the development and progression of tumors is DNA hypermethylation. Aberrant methylation of the promoter is an alternative epigenetic change in genetic mechanisms, leading to tumor {{suppressor gene}} inactivation. In the present study, we examined the TP 53 Arg 72 Pro and Pro 47 Ser polymorphisms using PCR-RFLP and the pattern of methylation of the p 53 gene by methylation-specific PCR in 90 <b>extra-axial</b> brain <b>tumor</b> samples. Patients who had the allele Pro of the TP 53 Arg 72 Pro polymorphism had an increased risk of tumor development (odds ratio, OR = 3. 23; confidence interval at 95 %, 95 % CI = 1. 71 - 6. 08; P = 0. 003), as did the allele Ser of TP 53 Pro 47 Ser polymorphism (OR = 1. 28; 95 % CI = 0. 03 - 2. 10; P = 0. 01). Comparison of overall survival of patients did not show significant differences. In the analysis of DNA methylation, we observed that 37. 5 % of meningiomas, 30 % of schwannomas and 52. 6 % of metastases were hypermethylated, suggesting that methylation is important for tumor progression.

30|$|Brain tumors {{represent}} a recognized cause of epilepsy in {{both children and}} adults. In principle, any <b>tumor</b> (<b>extra-axial,</b> intra-axial, benign or malignant, common or uncommon) can cause seizures. However, patients with supratentorial low-grade glial tumors {{are more likely to}} develop epilepsy. Several clinical studies emphasize that pharmacologically intractable epilepsy critically affects the daily life of patients with brain tumors, even if the tumor is under control. Recently, the term of long-term epilepsy associated tumour (LEAT) has been introduced. LEATs are low grade, slowly growing, cortically-based tumours which predominantly occur in young patients with long histories (often 2 years or more) of drug-resistant epilepsy. Glioneuronal tumors (GNT), including gangliogliomas (GG) and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNTs), represent the most common tumor within the spectrum of LEAT. The advent of the neurosurgical treatment of epilepsy-associated brain lesions confirmed the strong epileptogenicity of these tumor entities. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie epileptogenesis in LEATs is essential to identify new treatment targets and to develop an effective therapy. Mechanisms such as alterations of the balance between excitation and inhibition and alterations in neuron-glia interactions might be involved. Astroglial cells express functional receptors for a variety of neurotransmitters and may critically modulate synaptic transmission. In addition, an increasing number of observations indicate that pro-epileptogenic inflammatory pathways are activated in GNT and may contribute to the onset and progression of seizures. The recent advances and likely candidate mechanisms and molecules involved in tumor-associated epileptogenesis will be discussed.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic contrast-enhanced {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (dMRI) is a reproducible technique for determining exchange parameters and tissue compartments with high resolution throughout the human body. In the past, only low-molecular-weight, gadolinium (Gd) -based contrast agents were approved for clinical MRI in humans. Gd contrast agents are well tolerated, and MRI is highly sensitive in demonstrating their effects. Low-molecular-weight contrast media such as Gd-DTPA extravasate within {{a few seconds of}} injection. To improve separation of the signal contributions from intra- and extravascular contrast material, a low-molecular weight agent is injected into a peripheral vein as a rapid bolus over a few seconds. The contrast bolus flows through the capillary bed in highly concentrated form before it disperses evenly in the blood. Imaging of vascularization must capture the initial phase after injection when most of the administered bolus is still in the vessel and has not yet dispersed in blood. Low-molecular-weight Gd-based contrast media alter two parameters that can be measured by MRI: they shorten T 1 and T 2 relaxation times. Both effects can be used to visualize a bolus of contrast medium. In a first approximation, T 1 -weighted sequences provide images with a linear relationship between signal intensity and contrast medium concentration over a wide range. Signal changes are proportional to contrast medium concentrations and thus enable determination of vascular volume at rather low concentrations. High contrast medium concentrations lead to saturation and subsequent signal loss on T 1 -weighted sequences. On T 2 /T 2 *-weighted sequences, low concentrations of Gd-based contrast medium cause a slight signal loss with a subsequent exponential signal decrease at slightly higher concentrations. For these reasons, T 1 -weighted sequences are predominantly used to depict the contrast bolus at low contrast medium concentrations or extravasation at high concentrations. T 2 /T 2 *-weighted sequences only visualize a high-dose contrast bolus. The combination of T 1 -weighted MR imaging with bolus injection of contrast medium enables use of more sophisticated techniques for quantitative determination of vascular and interstitial volumes and exchange parameters. Such techniques rely on evaluation methods and a suitable pharmacokinetic model that specifically describes the predominant concentration and exchange processes for the low-molecular-weight contrast medium used. A model found to be suitable for this purpose is a 3 -compartment model. Such a model has been used for pharmacokinetic imaging of the brain before and is for the first time applied to the prostate in the present study. In the present study, a number of pharmacokinetic parameters could be quantified using the 3 compartment model. The diagnostic relevance of blood volume was investigated for glioma grading in a ROC analysis. The results suggest that the accuracy of a parameter derived from quantitative blood volume distributions is comparable to that of biopsy. Perfusion is a less relevant parameter than blood volume in assessing brain tumors. Other tumors investigated were meningiomas and distant metastases. Meningiomas differ from gliomas in two respects: they have a markedly larger blood volume and different microenvironment. Contrast medium extravasation has been divided into two bidirectional transport processes – one fast and one slow – which are also known as permeability into two separate interstitial volumes. Fast permeability can only serve to differentiate <b>extra-axial</b> <b>tumors</b> (meningiomas) from intra-axial tumors (gliomas and distant metastases). Slow permeability can be used to characterize necrotic tumors and thus allows differentiation of glioblastomas from low-grade gliomas in the brain. Perfusion, blood volume, and interstitial volume {{have been shown to be}} diagnostically relevant parameters. To improve representation of differences in microenvironment, scatter diagrams were used in which interstitial volume is plotted against blood volume. The results show that, based on their microenviroments, different tumor entities occupy different areas in such diagrams. For dMRI of the prostate, the pharmacokinetic model has been extended to encompass prostate cancer as a new tumor entity. Only a few study groups have so far used dMRI for imaging of prostate cancer, and most investigators did not quantify compartments and exchange constants. Since perfusion in the prostate is not the same as in the brain, a novel dual-contrast pulse sequence was used for dMRI. This sequence also visualizes the contrast bolus in prostate tissue. The evaluation method and pharmacokinetic model were further modified for analysis of dMRI of the prostate. The refined method differs from that used for analysis of cerebral MRI in that additional intensity homogenization and motion correction are applied prior to analysis. Phase images are used to correct for pulsations of the AIF. It is necessary to take into account not only delay relative to the AIF but also bolus dispersion in order to adequately describe arrival of contrast medium at the target site. The dual echo sequence with use of a markedly longer echo time for the second echo enabled quantification of mean transfer time and perfusion as additional parameters. It was shown that perfusion is significantly higher in prostate cancer compared with normal prostate tissue. Unlike for brain tumors, it was found that perfusion is a more relevant parameter than blood volume for prostate imaging. In conclusion, use of a 3 -compartment model enables detailed and spatially resolved analysis of tissue parameters...|$|R
40|$|Background: Meningiomas are {{considered}} <b>extra-axial</b> and benign <b>tumors.</b> Though they are pathologically classified as benign, non-benign and other types, {{it seems that}} information derived from this classification cannot explain {{the behavior of the}} tumor. Pretumoral brain edema (PTBE) is one of the signs that has been less thoroughly studied, and still {{there is not a single}} consensus about its mechanism. Despite the benign and extra-axial manifestations of meningioma, in more than 60 % of cases, these tumors have PTBE. The goals of this study were to show the role of the level of progesterone positivity in tumor cells as a behavioral factor and to find different features in the MRI and CT scans of meningioma patients that might be related to this issue and also to PTBE. Materials and methods: In this study, 77 patients with intracranial meningiomas who referred to the Neurosurgery Department of Imam Khomeini Hospital in Tehran were followed prospectivity between 1999 - 2003. Initial CT scans and MRIs (T 1, T 2) were performed on each patient, and certain imaging features of the tumors—including the diameter, volume, location, contour, presence or absence of PTBE, and the shape of tumor—were detected. Then a comprehensive comparison of these factors with surgical and pathological findings, clinical presentations, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) were carried out. Results: Tumors with higher PR levels had smaller sizes, and their contours were smoother. Images showed that these tumors were less invasive, in that in more than 50 % of the cases, the arachnoid space (AS) around the tumor could be observed, and it was less probable to see PTBE. Instead, the duration of the disease was longer, and the intrasurgical bleeding was less. Conclusions: The results of this study show that the future behavior of intracranial meningioma tumors cannot be predicted based on such features as diameter, location, contour, and volume. Instead, we must obtain more in formation about the tumors’ cells in order to predict the future behavior of these tumors...|$|R
