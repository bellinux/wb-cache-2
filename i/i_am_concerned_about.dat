500|$|The Creek Turnpike {{was opposed}} by area {{residents}} from its conception. Forming {{a group called}} [...] "Tulsans Against Turnpikes", around 220 citizens gathered at a meeting on February 16, 1989, to discuss the proposed toll road. Opponents to the turnpike cited detrimental effects to their community and to the environment as their concerns. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> is that it changes the complexion of south Tulsa. It {{would no longer be}} a residential area," [...] said Tom Taylor, an area resident. Some residents also complained that the proposed turnpike would mainly serve through traffic, despite OTA estimates that south Tulsa residents would make up 90% of the road's userbase.|$|E

And I don't believe that our beef is with our ally, the Italians, but rather with the terrorists." [...] The American leadership in Washington concluded that while Steiner and his men could take the terrorists it was unlikely they would be able to get them out of Italy. By 4:00a.m. CET the next day, orders arrived for Steiner and his men to stand down.|$|E
2500|$|What <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> is the trend, {{common among}} present-day Buddhist teachers, of {{recasting}} the core {{principles of the}} Buddha's teachings into largely psychological terms and then saying, [...] "This is Dhamma." [...] When this is done we may never get {{to see that the}} real purpose of the teaching, in its own framework, is not to induce [...] "healing" [...] or [...] "wholeness" [...] or [...] "self-acceptance," [...] but to propel the mind in the direction of deliverance – and to do so by attenuating, and finally extricating, all those mental factors responsible for our bondage and suffering. We should remember that the Buddha did not teach the Dhamma as an [...] "art of living" [...] – though it includes that – but above all as a path to deliverance, a path to final liberation and enlightenment. And what the Buddha means by enlightenment is not a celebration of the limitations of the human condition, not a passive submission to our frailties, but an overcoming of those limitations by making a radical, revolutionary breakthrough to an altogether different dimension of being.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. [...] "Commissioner" [...] Booth-Clibborn {{says that}} when [...] "London {{headquarters}} heard of the affair, it disapproved of {{the action of the}} Commissioner."

But what then? The upshot of all this is that Mr. Booth-Clibborn has made as great a blunder as simple Mr. Trotter did. The pair of Balaams greatly desired to curse, but have been compelled to bless. They have, between them, completely justified my reliance on Mr. Sumner as a perfectly trustworthy witness; and neither of them has dared to challenge the accuracy of one solitary statement made by that worthy gentleman, whose full story I hope some day or other to see set before the public. Then the true causes of his action will be made known.|$|E
