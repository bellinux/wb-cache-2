40|$|AbstractElectro-hydrostatic {{actuator}} (EHA) was {{a typical}} power-by-wire (PBW) actuator, which was widely-used in large commercial aircrafts, such as Airbus A 380. The electro-hydrostatic actuator(EHA) had the advantages of small sizes, light weight, high power density, high reliability and maintainability. With the application of EHA in large commercial airplanes, the airworthiness certification of EHA became an new problem. The precondition of the airworthiness certification of EHA was to understand its operating principle and characteristic. Because of no centralized hydraulic oil tank and short cycle oil circuit, the temperature-rise of the hydraulic system in EHA always kept high during operation. Therefore, {{it was important to}} build the thermal-hydraulic models of the hydraulic system in EHA, and to do the thermal analysis of the EHA by this model. In this paper, a lumped-parameter thermal-hydraulic model of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>part</b> in EHA was proposed. The model was built based on the detailed analysis of the heat transfer of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>part</b> in EHA. By the simulation of a practical system and the comparison with the traditional hydraulic system, the accuracy and practicality of this model was verified...|$|E
40|$|Damage {{induced by}} {{microcracking}} affects {{not only the}} mechanical behaviour of geomaterials but also their hydraulic properties. Evaluating these impacts is important for many engineering applications, such as the safety assessment of radioactive waste disposal facilities. This paper presents a new constitutive model accounting simultaneously {{for the impact of}} damage on hydraulic and mechanical properties of unsaturated poroplastic geomaterials. The hydro-mechanical coupling is formulated by means of the thermodynamic framework for partially saturated media, extended by taking into account isotropic damage and plasticity. State and complementary laws are governed by the so-called plastic effective stress and equivalent pore pressure. Assuming a bimodal pore size distribution for cracked porous media, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>part</b> (water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity) is modelled using phenomenological functions of damage variable. The participation of damage on both mechanical and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>part</b> enables this model to describe bilateral couplings between them. This coupled model is then validated against a number of experimental data obtained from Callovo-Oxfordian argillite, which is the possible host rock for a radioactive waste disposal in France. Parametric studies are also carried out to check the consistency and to better demonstrate the bilateral couplings in the model...|$|E

30|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>part</b> of {{the test}} {{consists}} in injecting the fluid at a prescribed flow rate with a chromatography pump, which also measures the injection pressure. Once the fluid has percolated through the fracture, it is recovered in an annular reservoir surrounding the rock sample. With the containment cell being pressurised (0.1  MPa), each time the solenoid valves located outside the chamber (at atmospheric pressure) are opened, the pressure difference flushes the fluid from the annular reservoir via capillaries (with a diameter of 1 / 16 th of an inch) to the systems for measuring the physicochemical changes in the fluid, for collecting samples and for monitoring the outflow. The last, which is done by weighing the fluid, enables one to verify, for an imposed injection rate, {{that there is no}} fluid loss in the circuit whether through leakage or excessive evaporation. To limit evaporation, the nitrogen used for pressurising the cell is water saturated through bubbling.|$|E

40|$|Single-blade {{centrifugal}} impellers {{for sewage}} systems undergo both unsteady radial and axial thrusts.

In this study, we conducted component analyses of radial and axial thrusts of closed, single-blade centrifugal pumps with different blade outlet angles by numerical analysis while considering leakage flow. The results revealed the effect of the blade outlet angle on the components of radial and axial thrusts. For increased flow rates, the time-averaged values of the pressure component were similar for all impellers, although its fluctuating components were higher for impellers with larger blade outlet angles. Moreover, the fluctuating inertia component of the impeller with a blade outlet angle of 8 ° decreased as the flow rate increased, whereas those with 16 ° and 24 ° angles increased. Therefore, the radial thrust on the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>part</b> was significantly higher for impellers with high blade outlet angles...|$|E

40|$|Vehicular {{drivelines}} with hierarchical powertrain control require good component controller tracking, {{enabling the}} main controller {{to reach the}} desired goals. This paper focuses {{on the development of}} a transmission ratio controller for a hydraulically actuated metal push-belt continuously variable transmission (CVT), using models for the mechanical and the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>part</b> of the CVT. The controller consists of an anti-windup PID feedback part with linearizing weighting and a setpoint feedforward. Physical constraints on the system, especially with respect to the hydraulic pressures, are accounted for using a feedforward part to eliminate their undesired effects on the ratio. The total ratio controller guarantees that one clamping pressure setpoint is minimal, avoiding belt slip, while the other is raised above the minimum level to enable shifting. This approach has potential for improving the efficiency of the CVT, compared to non-model based ratio controllers. Vehicle experiments show that adequate tracking is obtained together with good robustness against actuator saturation. The largest deviations from the ratio setpoint are caused by actuator pressure saturation. It is further revealed that all feedforward and compensator terms in the controller have a beneficial effect on minimizing the tracking error...|$|E

Designing a pump which has acceptable vibration characteristics when new is not sufficient. As various publications indicate, it is mainly wear of internal pump annular seals which lead to vibration problems of originally smooth running units [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The calculation of pump vibrational behavior is {{an important element in}} establishing maintenance intervals to ensure reliable operation. While the mechanical rotor system and boundary conditions at journal bearings can be modelled quite accurately, interaction forces within the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>part</b> of the pump are not well known. Impeller interaction is one important influence on rotordynamics. However, these forces are not sensitive to internal wear. Impeller interaction is treated by several authors [7, 8, 9]. Reliable dynamic modelling of annular seals is established within centrifugal pumps. Measured results of a full scale test machine are presented and used to conform the newly developed, improved model. The overall influence of a change in seal design from smooth to serrated is shown.
