40|$|The use of poly methyl {{methacrylate}} (PMMA) based bone cement as a <b>grouting</b> <b>agent</b> for the fixation of orthopaedic implants {{has been in}} practice for nearly fifty years. Fatigue fracture {{has been identified as}} the primary cause of cement failure. Implant loosening due to the failure of the cement {{is one of the major}} factors necessitating revision surgery. The need for a more fatigue resistant bone cement is well documented in literature, and one method of producing a more fatigue tolerant bone cement is to reinforce it with short fibers. The fundamental objective of this work was to investigate the possible improvement of the fatigue characteristics of bone cement by incorporating two types of fiber reinforcement; short flexible fiber Polyethylene Terephalate (PET) fibers and stiff milled carbon fibers. The effects of the fiber reinforcement on the bone cement were determined experimentally. Since fatigue characteristics are known to have considerable scatter, the experimental data were analyzed statistically, the effect of the fiber reinforcement was also analyzed using a theoretical model coupled with extensive scanning electron microscopy of the fractured surfaces. The results of the research indicate that the fiber reinforcement improved the fatigue resistance of the bone cement. This could potentially lead to a more fatigue tolerant bone cement, which would delay implant loosening and the need for revision surgery...|$|E

40|$|Sweden has a {{long history}} of {{research}} within the field of rock fissure grouting in hard crystalline rock mass due to strict environmental requirements regarding allowable ground water draw down. These requirements normally implies that fractures down to aperture size between 50 to 100 μm needs to be sealed and within these ranges the size of the particles for cementitious <b>grouting</b> <b>agents</b> becomes a limiting factor. For a grouting design it is therefore of importance to consider the aperture size distribution of the rock mass in order to predict the groutability for both cementitious and non-cementitious <b>grouting</b> <b>agents.</b> Transmissivity data from hydraulic tests (water pressure tests) and number of fractures along a borehole can be assessed from core logging for further use as input for a statistical interpretation of fracture data to simulate an aperture size distribution. A methodology developed at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, is proposed. The method is a statistical evaluation of groutability (SEG) and is based on the Pareto distribution. A computational design tool has been developed to simplify the use of the statistical evaluation and to make the research more accessible to end users, designers, in the grouting industry. The aim of this article is to present two case studies where the statistical interpretation of fracture data is performed by using the computational design tool and how the outcome can be of great use in finding a more accurate grouting design. The case studies include fracture data sets from two large infrastructure rock tunnel projects in Sweden; a road tunnel in Stockholm and a railroad tunnel in Gothenburg...|$|R
40|$|Injection {{of repair}} agent (grout) into {{boreholes}} is a repair technique commonly applied to deteriorated concrete structures, ensuring that interconnected cracks and voids are eliminated. The repair effect is evaluated from {{the increase in}} the pulse velocity between before and after grouting. Measured velocities after grouting, however, unexpectedly led to a remarkable decrease {{in the case of a}} 70 -year old dam. This resulted in a doubt about the efficiency of repair. Through investigation, it was concluded that the velocity decrease was attributed to the initial low stiffness of the cement <b>grouting</b> <b>agent</b> due to insufficient hydration in cold environments where the structure is located. Theoretical investigation based on multiple scattering theory is performed, as the filling material acts as a scatterer in the concrete matrix. It is found that the pulse velocity of the structure is lower than that of the initial damaged condition before the repair agent becomes hardened up to an adequate level of stiffness. Accordingly, the amount of the agent injected into the structure was strongly correlated with the velocity decrease after grouting. As a result, the velocity decrease was observed in the repaired dam. Further validation was conducted after a period of 2 years in the same structure with exactly the same sensor arrangement as before. It is clarified that, the velocity distribution measured is in remarkable agreement with that predicted in the theory just after grouting...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{assessed}} {{the health effects}} of occupational acrylamide exposure using hemoglobin (Hb) adducts as biomarkers of internal dose. METHODS: Two hundred and ten tunnel workers exposed for about 2 months to a chemical-grouting agent containing acrylamide and N-methylolacrylamide underwent a health examination. Blood samples were drawn for the analysis of Hb adducts of acrylamide. Fifty workers claiming recently developed or deteriorated symptoms of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) were referred to a neurophysiological examination. Workers with Hb-adduct levels exceeding 0. 3 nmol/g globin attended follow-up examinations 6, 12, and 18 months after exposure cessation. RESULTS: Forty-seven workers had Hb-adduct levels within the normal background range (0. 02 - 0. 07 nmol/g globin), while the remaining 163 had increased levels up to a maximum of 17. 7 nmol/g globin. Clear-cut dose-response associations were found between the Hb-adduct levels and PNS symptoms. Thirty-nine percent of those with Hb-adduct levels exceeding 1 nmol/g globin experienced tingling or numbness in their hands or feet. A no-observed adverse effect level of 0. 51 nmol/g globin was estimated for numbness or tingling in the feet or legs. For 23 workers there was strong evidence of PNS impairment due to occupational exposure to acrylamide. All but two had recovered 18 months after the cessation of exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposure to a <b>grouting</b> <b>agent</b> containing acrylamide resulted in PNS symptoms and signs. The use of Hb adducts of acrylamide as a biomarker of internal dose revealed strong dose-response associations. The PNS symptoms were, however, generally mild, and in almost all cases they were reversible...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a detailed experimental {{investigation of the}} mechanical behaviour of fully grouted steel cables used for rock reinforcement in hard rock. An attempt is also made to explain the possible modes of deformation and cable failure, based on observations from the experiments. The behaviour is investigated using pull-out and shear tests. Two mechanically quite different cables, a steel wire rope and a steel strand were tested in the experiments. The cable, types and design are specified in detail, and results from mechanical tests are presented. A cement based grout was used as <b>grouting</b> <b>agent</b> for the cables. Through extensive tests of compressive and tensile strengths, different properties of grout with and without additives are defined. The effect of both the curing conditions and the water segregation are studied. Laboratory scale pull-out tests on cables with short and long embedded lengths were conducted. The tests define what {{are believed to be}} important aspects of the mechanical behaviour of a grouted cable. The effect of the embedded length, cable surface properties, curing conditions and grouts with and without additives on the mechanical behaviour of the grouted cables are given. It is shown that the cable surface properties, the curing conditions as well as type of grout significantly effect the pull-out behaviour of the cable. No general correlation between cement grout compressive or tensile strength and bond strength in pull-out tests was established. However, the bond strength increases with increasing compressive strength of grout without additives. The laboratory scale pull-out tests are compared with insitu pull-out tests to establish the validity of the test procedure. It is concluded that pull-out tests should, (unless they are conducted for purposes of comparison) be conducted under in-situ conditions where the results will be applied later, whenever this is possible. Shear tests on the steel wire rope were unsuccessful because the rock blocks, inside which the rope was grouted, failed. The shear tests of the steel strand indicated however high shear loads and large shear displacements before failure of the cable occurred. Failure of cable reinforcement in hard rock is discussed. Here, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that cable failure will be a more important factor than failure of the rock, grout or intermediate bonds. Results from further in-situ pull-out tests confirm this assumption. An in-situ test procedure for cables in hard rock conditions is proposed. The stiffness/compliance of a fully grouted cable is defined. However, it is concluded from the pull-out tests that the complete pull-out curve always should be considered, in the interpretation of the pull-out test results. Results of in-situ pull-out tests show that blast induced dynamic loading before pull-out can have a significant effect on the pull-out behaviour of the cable. Borehole / cable diameter ratios were found to have an insignificant effect on the pull-out behaviour of the cable. Finally, the results of this investigation are discussed and recommendations for cable reinforcement in hard rock are made. Godkänd; 1984; 20070502 (ysko...|$|E

30|$|Acrylamide {{is a white}} {{crystalline}} solid, non-volatile, odorless, and has a high mobility in {{soil and}} groundwater (Ashoor & Zent, 1984; Eriksson, 2005). The common uses of acrylamide are in papermaking aids, dyes, cosmetics, production of polyacrylamides, flocculants in sewage and wastewater treatment, enhancers of oil recovery, ore processing, clarifying drinking water, and <b>grouting</b> <b>agents</b> {{for the construction of}} dam foundations (Smith & Oehme, 1991). Acrylamide is formed during heat processing of carbohydrate-rich foods at elevated temperatures (120  °C) or above (Maillard reaction) during frying, broiling, baking, roasting, grilling, and toasting (Tareke, Rydberg, Karlsson, Eriksson, & Törnqvist, 2002) due to the natural presence of the reactants (glucose/fructose and asparagine) which are involved in the formation of acrylamide. Acrylamide is not found in foods which are not fried or baked such as boiling (Eriksson, 2005; Törnqvist, 2005). Acrylamide {{has been shown to be}} toxic to both the central and the peripheral nervous system (LoPachin, 2004; LoPachin, Schwarcz, Gaughan, Mansukhani, & Das, 2003).

40|$|This report {{describes}} a full-scale grouting {{test in the}} Törnskog Tunnel. The tunnel {{is part of the}} Nordlänken project north of Stockholm, which has two separated tunnel tubes. The test was conducted during production of the tunnel during spring 2005 in chainage from 12012 to 12112. A new concept of grouting was designed and executed based on the grouting material silica sol with the brand name Meyco MP 320. Silica sol has been succesfully tested before in field tests in Hallandåsen 2003 and in Äspö HRL 2004. This test is the first test with silica sol in full production of a tunnel in hard rock. The initiative was taken by the National Road Administration, Oden Anläggningsentreprenad and AB BESAB. Design of the grouting procedure were based on a standard tests for characterisation of the rock mass. With use of a pareto-distribution curve, the hydraulic apertures of the fractures could be computed, further the hydraulic apertures was used to estimate the inflows to the tunnel. The demands set on the allowable leakage into the tunnel resulted that hydraulic apertures down to 14 &# 956;m needed to be sealed. Cement can penetrate and seal apertures down to 0. 05 - 0. 1 mm and therefore it was necessary to use a grout material that has a better penetrability, like silica sol. The grout, named Meyco MP 320, was chosen and the design parameters were established: grout pressure, gel time, grouting time. The desired penetration was 1. 2 m in order to limit unnecessary spread of the grout. The design was different than the traditional grouting methods with demands set on the effective grouting time at a prescribed pressure. All grout fans were carefully monitored using hydraulic tests, before and after grouting as well as control of the actual grouting. Last, the result of the grouting was complemented with a drip characterisation. Two types of grout fans were used. One with the above mentioned grout procedure and one based on the grouting procedure normally used in the Törnskogs Tunnel, but with silica sol instead of cement. The first type fan was used when the rock quality was poor. The other when the rock quality was better. The test with these type fans with silica sol were conducted in one tunnel tube, T 201, the other tube was grouted with cement following the standard procedure used in the project. This enabled a comparison of the sealing effect between the cement grouted tunnel tube and silica sol grouted tube. The results of the grouting showed that 8 out of totally 9 grouting fans were successful. The designed fans were used in five cases were the rock mass were presumed to be of poor quality, that is with larger fracture zones present. The objective for this field test was to limit the inflow of water to tunnel corresponding to value of the transmissivity of 3. 2 &# 1468; 10 - 7 m 2 /s for the grouted section of 100 m. After grouting the achieved transmissivity was calculated to be 6. 2 &# 1468; 10 - 7 m 2 /s. The achieved value of the transmissivity is rather close to the desired; the achieved value considers all fans, including the unsuccessful one. No significant conclusion could be made with the comparison of the sealing effect using cement or silica sol as a <b>grouting</b> <b>agent.</b> The conclusion is that the technique of grouting is very important and more effort needs to be done regarding the grouting time...|$|E

40|$|Grouting {{is usually}} {{successful}} in excavations at moderate depths and groundwater inflow. At great depths, in post-grouting or in rock {{with a large}} inflow of water, grouting is more problematic due to the forces from groundwater. The thesis aims to increase {{the understanding of the}} groundwater forces that act on <b>grouting</b> <b>agents</b> in rock and characterisation of the required grout strength to withstand the forces. The outcome is {{a better understanding of the}} strength demands, thus providing an opportunity to perform more successful grouting. The strength of a gelling liquid for grouting in hard rock, silica sol, has been investigated. The strength of silica sol increases over a long time and the rate is depending on the humidity. In low humidities, silica sol shrinks but immersed in water, no shrinkage occurs. Further, a new robust method for determining the yield stress of cementitious grout in the field, termed the Yield stick, was developed. The method consists of a stick that sinks into the grout and the yield strength of the grout is determined by the sink depth. Good agreement was found between the Yield stick and reference tests made with rheometer. A study of the erosion process was performed where a Bingham fluid was injected into a pipe with flowing water. The study showed that the most important factor for the erosion process was the flow regime of water. To relate the conclusions with field conditions, grouting should always be done with shear strength of the grout that is higher than the shear stress from water, the grouting time should be sufficiently long and the grouting pressure should be resolute...|$|R
40|$|Acrylamide (AM) and N-methylolacrylamide (NMA) {{are used}} in the {{formulation}} of grouting materials. AM undergoes metabolism to a reactive epoxide, glycidamide (GA). Both AM and GA react with hemoglobin to form adducts that can be related to exposure to AM. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the extent to which NMA could form the same adducts as AM. N-(2 -carbamoylethyl) valine (AAVal derived from AM) and N-(2 carbamoyl- 2 -hydroxyethyl) valine (GAVal derived from GA) were measured following a single oral dose of AM (50 mg/kg) or NMA (71 mg/kg) in male F 344 rats. AAVal and GAVal were measured by a modified Edman degradation to produce phenylthiohydantoin derivatives and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. In AM-treated rats, AAVal was 21 � 1. 7 -pmol/mg globin (mean � SD, n � 4), and GAVal was 7. 9 � 0. 8 pmol/mg. In NMA-treated rats, AAVal was 41 � 4. 9 pmol/mg, and GAVal was 1. 4 � 0. 1 pmol/mg. Whether AAVal was derived from reaction of NMA with globin followed by loss of the hydroxymethyl group, or loss of the hydroxymethyl group to form AM prior to reaction with globin, is not known. However, the higher ratio of AAVal:GAVal in NMA-treated rats (29 vs. 2. 6 in AM-treated rats) suggests that reaction of NMA with globin is the predominant route to AAVal in NMA-treated rats. The detection of GAVal in NMA-treated rats indicates oxidation of NMA, either directly or following conversion to AM. The lower levels of GAVal on NMA administration suggest that a much lower level of epoxide was formed than compared with AM treatment.

The wait time effects of cementitous grouts, epoxy, acrylic latex, and polyvinyl acetate bonding agents were observed on bond strength. Three rapid repair materials were as a comparison to bond strength, as well as concrete samples with no bonding agents having dry conditions and saturated surface dry moisture condition. The bonding agents and rapid repair materials were tested in a controlled laboratory environment. Bond strength loss with wait times of 0, 2, 5, 10, and 30 minutes were observed when bonding agents were applied. The laboratory samples were loaded using a direct shear test. Field tests were performed using the same repair materials and bonding agents. When the agents were applied in the field the wait times used were 0, 15, 30, and 45 minutes. 7 day and 5 month pull off tensile tests were performed during the field experiment. The data from both experiments show that when using cement <b>grout</b> bonding <b>agents</b> the high bond strength can be obtained when the repair material is applied within 15 minutes of application of the cement grout, and after 15 minutes bond loss can be expected.

40|$|Subject of {{this work}} are {{experimental}} investigations on the injection behaviour of grouting suspensions based on microfine binders {{and the development of}} their depth of penetration. Microfine binders are air separated, very fine grained, hydraulic bonding agents. Suspended in fluids they are suited for grouting fine pore systems which could only be <b>grouted</b> by chemical <b>agents</b> until now. However, sodium-silicate injections are more often admitted carefully due to ecological objections. As the calculation parameters of the groutability of microfine binders were not systematically analysed yet, there are some uncertainties in the practical design of groutings with microfine binders. In a first step one-dimensional grouting tests were performed with a variation of different influencing parameters. Clogging and deep filtration occurred in all test series. These effects increased with decreasing grouting rate and thus the decrease of the hydraulic traction forces. The coefficient of permeability k* and the density of the suspension after discharge were identified as indicators of these phenomena. The coefficient of permeability k* represents the calculated values of the permeability of the pore system for the grouted suspension. (orig.)
