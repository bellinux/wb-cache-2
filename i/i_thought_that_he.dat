She remarked that she watches C-SPAN every day. Although she identified herself as an unnamed entertainer, she was recognized by the C-SPAN host, who subsequently questioned her about her 1992 support for independent presidential candidate Ross Perot. She said, [...] "When I heard him talk right in the beginning, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would bring some sort of common-sense business approach and also less partisanship, but then... I was completely disappointed like everyone else when he just kind of cut and run {{and no one knew}} exactly why... Maybe he couldn't have withstood all the investigation that goes on now".|$|E

"First of all I was {{attracted}} to the songs, because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> painted great pictures in his lyrics, particularly for someone {{who had not been}} around the typical Music Row co-writes. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> sang very well too. But more than anything {{there was a kind of}} this ‘I-will-do-it’ look in his eyes - I was really drawn in by the fact that he was so set on being successful in this business." ...|$|E
2500|$|When McTavish and Brian Frons, {{president}} of ABC Daytime, collaborated on the storyline, their {{inspiration for the}} pairing was a story from two decades earlier [...] the Adam Chandler/Dixie Cooney/Tad Martin love triangle of the late 1980s [...] where Adam was set up as the roadblock against Tad and Dixie's union. McTavish and Frons originally saw Babe and Jamie as the true love couple with JR as the antagonist. Babe's true love was later revised. The character explains, [...] "Jamie was around {{at one of the}} lowest points of my life, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the one. But I was wrong. As great as Jamie was, he could never take JR’s place in my heart, because JR never left." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} <b>I</b> almost <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would take me}} at my word, as most fervently I hoped. But he {{restrained}} himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of fact, I had some slight {{acquaintance}} with him, and <b>I</b> always <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a remarkably strong young fellow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I am glad,' I answered; and as <b>I</b> spoke <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> knew {{everything}} he would understand why my eyes glistened, as I am sure they did.|$|R
2500|$|Chapter 5 {{looks at}} the inanity of the society depicted, insofar as an {{intellectual}} discussion {{of the work of}} Chatterton between Obtuse Angle, Little Scopprell, Aradobo and Tilly Lally descends into farce; [...] "Obtuse Angle said in the first place you thought he was not [...] & then afterwards when I said he was not you thought he was not. Why I know that – Oh no sir <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not, but I ask'd to know whether he was. – How can that be said Obtuse Angle how could you ask & think that he was not – why said he. It came into my head that he was not. – Why then said Obtuse Angle you said that he was. Did I say so Law I did not think I said that – Did not he said Obtuse Angle Yes said Scopprell. But I meant said Aradobo I I I can't think Law Sir I wish you'd tell me, how it is." [...] Northrop Frye refers to this incident as [...] "farcical conversational deadlock." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{returned}} to North Dakota for a tonsillectomy and was noticed by hotel owner Frank Bering {{while working at}} the Doll House in Palm Springs, California. It was here that she developed her trademark sultry purr – having decided {{to compete with the}} noisy crowd with subtlety rather than volume. Beringin offered her a gig at The Buttery Room, a nightclub in the Ambassador Hotel East in Chicago. There, she was noticed by bandleader Benny Goodman. According to Lee, [...] "Benny's then-fiancée, Lady Alice Duckworth, came into The Buttery, and she was very impressed. So the next evening she brought Benny in, because {{they were looking for a}} replacement for Helen Forrest. And although I didn't know, I was it. He was looking at me strangely, I thought, but it was just his preoccupied way of looking. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> didn't like me at first, but it just was that he was preoccupied with what he was hearing." [...] She joined his band in 1941 and stayed for two years.|$|E
2500|$|At 15:04 {{my flight}} was {{attacked}} by three MiGs, two from the ‘10 o’clock’ and one from the ´6 o’clock´. Initially I didn’t see this last one because I had been concentrating on those approaching head-on. My WSO excitedly warned me about this rapidly approaching MiG, which was within firing range of my #3 and #4. I hesitated a while before interrupting my attack against the two MiGs in front, because I had seen the ‘Olds’ flight passing below us a few seconds before. I thought that the plane seen by my WSO {{could be one of}} them. Despite that, I suddenly turned left and then right, and caught sight of the third MiG. I ordered to my numbers 3 and 4 to break right. [...] As they did so, the MiG broke left for some mysterious reason and for a split second we were side by side. [...] We were so close that, besides the red stars in his wings, I could clearly see the pilot’s face. [...] I began a horizontal barrel roll to get away from him and into an attack position, once in position, I launched a Sidewinder. [...] The missile missed because the evading MiG broke left at full throttle. [...] But when he did it, he put himself {{in the line of fire}} of my number 2, Captain Everett T. Raspberry. [...] I ordered him to follow the prey, because the two aircraft that I initially saw had been placed in my forward sector. [...] I was in an advantageous position, so I fired two AIM-9s against them in a quick sequence, and I turned to place myself as wingman of my #2, Captain Raspberry. [...] I kept on descending besides Captain Raspberry and I remember that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was still out of the optimal launching envelope. But he performed a barrel roll that placed him in a perfect position again and he launched an AIM-9 which hit against the tail section of the MiG-21. It was shaken violently and later fell in a slow, almost plane spin.|$|E
60|$|This was {{somewhat}} of a surprise to me. <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> intended {{to wait until the}} arrival of Captain Hannock with the news of the loss of the Spitfire.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} girl, slowly and thoughtfully, [...] "I haven't. I wanted to, at fust; and then, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> truly meant {{what he said}} {{he would be willing to}} wait." ...|$|R
60|$|Had {{a pistol}} been fired beside his head {{he could not}} have started more violently, and <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have been utterly dumfounded; but he {{recovered}} himself with a most amazing quickness.|$|R
60|$|The Indian {{was quite}} sick {{this morning with}} the colic. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the worse for the moose meat he had eaten.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{want to be}} ill-natured; but {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted to borrow money, and didn't exactly know how to begin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The obvious view is {{not always}} the correct one,' he said. 'The marquis was, at least <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was, a very {{eccentric}} person.' ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{the first}} time I had heard him at his old habit since my return to Pellucidar, and <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had given up his little idiosyncrasy; but he hadn't. Far from it.|$|R
60|$|He {{absolutely}} {{managed to}} sit up, {{but only for}} a moment, and when he fell back <b>I</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would die there and then. I called to the Bengali dispenser, and hastened away from the room.|$|R
60|$|I told Henry. I didn't {{think it}} would matter, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it better <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should know.|$|R
6000|$|... "His coming is not likely. I cannot {{understand}} that he should come. He let me leave Silverbridge without seeing me,--and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was quite right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Queer thing I {{never thought}} of Hagon," [...] Francis remarked. [...] "As a matter of fact, I never {{see him in the}} Temple, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The skipper talks English, George. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would do}} so. Carthew {{was sure to}} have shipped someone who could {{understand}} him. I don't suppose his French is any better than mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; uncle {{told me so}} months ago. But <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> then <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would not}} live till Walter came of age, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> it was a mere form." ...|$|R
60|$|GREAT-HEART. Why, <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> quoth <b>he,</b> <b>that</b> so my Master Himself was served, and yet <b>He</b> it was <b>that</b> conquered at the last.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do! Oh, I can do nothing. I {{could do}} nothing, {{even though he}} were here in Baslehurst every day of his life. If <b>I</b> once <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> didn't wish me--to--be--his wife, I should {{not want to do}} anything. But, mamma, I can't believe it of him. It was only {{yesterday}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Arnie, you mustn't {{think of}} it," [...] she begged. [...] "He would never forgive me--never. The first time I {{asked him what}} was going on there, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have struck me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it?" [...] she said. [...] "I {{thought him}} the best {{and he is the}} best. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought that I was the best; and I wasn't. It shall be as I say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not. But {{if he did}} come, {{how could}} I refuse to see him? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was here on Saturday, and I told Richard to admit him. I could not send {{him away from the}} door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{always felt}} {{afraid of him}} for your sake, Finn. Mr. Monk is a clever man, and as honest a man as any in the House, but <b>I</b> always <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a {{dangerous}} friend for you. However, we will see. I will speak to Gresham after Christmas. There is no hurry about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, he did, and mouths too. But {{from the}} beginning, when I was a child, I have known <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was dangerous, and <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would pass on and forget me after a while. And I could have lived without him. Nay, {{there have been}} moments when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could learn to love some one else." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Of large build, ruddy countenance and of cheery disposition, Ulyett was {{a typical}} Yorkshireman" [...] He was clean hitter of a cricket ball and a fast bowler with [...] "a high action". Lyttleton also says {{he was not a}} {{particularly}} skilful bowler: [...] "He pounded away straight and hard but <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> used his head much".|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{can that}} be, Dick?" [...] Surajah said in surprise. [...] "Nothing {{could be more}} {{straightforward}} than the governor seemed to be. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was even rash, in speaking as frankly as he did to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hoped so, {{although}} there was no arrangement between us to meet here. Still, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have made his way down here, if possible, as he would then be able to escape in the lugger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, {{but why do}} {{you suppose}} that Oro, the servant of Degai, lives in that mountain? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> lived in a grove yonder where your priests, as I am told, have an image of him." ...|$|E
60|$|I was {{somewhat}} staggered at his answer. I had expected a groan of remorse. The ghost appeared, on the contrary, {{to be rather}} conceited over the business. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that,</b> as <b>he</b> had taken my reference to the wait so quietly, perhaps {{he would not be}} offended if I questioned him about the organ-grinder. I felt curious about that poor boy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> Colonel, <b>that</b> {{possibly}} <b>he</b> {{might go}} as a volunteer--most regiments take out {{one or two}} young fellows, who have not interest enough to obtain a commission." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I {{saw them}} in the city to-day {{and they seemed to}} b the {{greatest}} friends. When I wanted to see Mr Melmotte he bolted himself into an inner room, but he took your brother with him. He would not have done that if they had not been friends. When I saw it <b>I</b> almost <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had consented to the marriage.' ...|$|R
