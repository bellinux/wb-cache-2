40|$|Spurred by {{the growing}} need of {{information}} transfer around the globe, considerable investment is being made {{in the private sector}} to develop and field new commercial SATCOM services. From the military perspective, the exploitation of this commercially developed SATCOM services becomes an attractive augmentation to expensive MILSATCOM programs especially in an era of declining defense dollars. Applications such as battlefield situational awareness, operational planning and execution, weather, telemedicine, operations and maintenance support, tailored intelligence, distance learning, training, morale, welfare and recreation services are areas where emerging commercial wide-band satellite systems such as Teledesic, Skybridge, Cyberstar, Astrolink and Spaceway might offer possible solutions. This thesis analyzes these five commercial satellite systems in terms of their performance measures derived from the seven required characteristics as defined in the Advanced MILSATCOM Capstone Requirement <b>Document</b> <b>Ref.</b> 7.

40|$|The {{second round}} of the Mock LISA Data Challenges {{involves}} two two-year data sets. The first data set (Challenge 2. 1) contains the signal from 2. 7 × 107 Galactic white dwarf binaries based on the population synthesis of Nelemans (ref). The second data set (Challenge 2. 2) contains different realization of the Galactic binaries of the first data set along with 4 to 6 massive black hole (MBH) binaries and 5 extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) [1]. There are also 5 single source EMRI data sets (Challenges 1. 3. 1 to 1. 3. 5) from the first round of challenges. Since the data sets of challenges 2. 1 and 2. 2 more closely mimic a true LISA signal, we intend to measure the success of the entries at returning subsets of data relevant to the LISA Science Case <b>document</b> (<b>ref).</b> For Galactic binaries, we consider four basic questions: (i) identification of individual binaries for follow-on electromagnetic observations; (ii) measurement {{of the structure of the}} Galaxy; (iii) measurement of the shape of the spectrum; and (iv) subtraction of the foreground signal. For MBH inspirals, we consider two questions: (i) identification for follow-on electromagnetic observations; and (ii) subtraction of the signal from the data stream. For EMRIs, we also consider two questions: (i) identification of central black hole mass and spin; and (ii) subtraction of the signal from the data stream. 2 Measuring Closeness of Fit Since the full set of parameters necessary to describe the source is not needed to answer some of the questions posed above, we will measure how well an entry successfully extracts the important parameters by measuring the distance between the returned parameters and the key parameters in a projected sub-space of the full parameter space. To do this, we will use the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as the metric in the full parameter space.

40|$|Abstract. In these lecture notes, a {{selection}} of frequently required statistical tools will be introduced and illustrated. They allow to post-process data that stem from, e. g., large-scale numerical simulations (aka sequence of random experiments).

Consequently, an exemplary implementation of the presented techniques using the python program-ming language is provided. The contents of these lecture notes is rather selective and represents a computational experimentalist’s view on the subject of basic data analysis, ranging from the simple computation of moments for distributions of ran-dom variables to more involved topics such as hierarchical cluster analysis and the parallelization of python code. Note that in order to save space, all python snippets presented in the follow-ing are undocumented. In general, this has to be considered as bad program-ming style.

40|$|Higher-order Laue zone (HOLZ) {{pattern is}} very useful in {{measurement}} of crystalline lattice parameters, strain and composition variation {{in a small}} area of sample [1, 2].

Although CBED patterns and included HOLZ lines are best modeled using a dynamical formulation, models based on a geometrical interpretation for the HOLZ-line positions have remained in widespread use because of their simplicity. Moreover, the geometrical interpretation is helpful to understand the formation of HOLZ lines for beginners. The geometrical interpretation of HOLZ lines {{can be carried out}} in either Ewald sphere construction or dispersion surface construction [3]. As shown in Ref.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Design Analysis is to develop {{preliminary}} design of the waste package transporter used for waste package (WP) transport and related functions in the subsurface repository. This analysis refines the conceptual design that was started in Phase I of the Viability Assessment. This analysis supports {{the development of a}} reliable emplacement concept and a retrieval concept for license application design. The scope of this analysis includes the following activities: (1) Assess features of the transporter design and evaluate alternative design solutions for mechanical components. (2) Develop mechanical equipment details for the transporter. (3) Prepare a preliminary structural evaluation for the transporter. (4) Identify and recommend the equipment design for waste package transport and related functions. (5) Investigate transport equipment interface tolerances. This analysis supports the development of the waste package transporter for the transport, emplacement, and retrieval of packaged radioactive waste forms in the subsurface repository. Once the waste containers are closed and accepted, the packaged radioactive waste forms are termed waste packages (WP).

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} major modifications and improvements {{made to the}} modeling of the RAMONA- 3 B/MOD 0 code since 1981, when the code description and assessment report was completed. The {{new version of the}} code is RAMONA- 4 B. RAMONA- 4 B is a systems transient code for application to different versions of Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) such as the current BWR, the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR), and the Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (SBWR). This code uses a three-dimensional neutron kinetics model coupled with a multichannel, non-equilibrium, drift-flux, two-phase flow formulation of the thermal hydraulics of the reactor vessel. The code is designed to analyze a wide spectrum of BWR core and system transients and instability issues. Chapter 1 is an overview of the code`s capabilities and limitations; Chapter 2 discusses the neutron kinetics modeling and the implementation of reactivity edits. Chapter 3 is an overview of the heat conduction calculations. Chapter 4 presents modifications to the thermal-hydraulics model of the vessel, recirculation loop, steam separators, boron transport, and SBWR specific components.

40|$|The {{experimental}} database on {{core degradation}} and melt relocation (and their consequences on hydrogen production, vessel rupture) {{is limited to}} small-scale experiments which are only partially representative of what could occur in a reactor. As a consequence, there is uncertainty in the capability of codes to predict core degradation in postulated severe accident transients of nuclear power plants. The GAMA has launched an action {{in order to determine}} the ability of current advanced codes to predict core degradation in nuclear reactors. The TMI- 2 scenario was selected as the case to analyze since it concerns the only full scale Pressurized Water Reactor to have experienced core degradation. Data from the code calculations were compared to the TMI- 2 end-state to determine the codes‟ predictive capability. The study was completed in 2004, and is <b>documented</b> in <b>ref.</b> 2. One conclusion of the study is that variability in the codes predictions existed in part because initial conditions of the tMI- 2 scenario were not well defined. It was concluded that code variability could be better evaluated if these conditions were better defined. Therefore, an additional task was proposed to benchmark the codes. This phase II study evaluates the variability in the codes‟ results using a postulated core degradation scenario of the TMI- 2 reactor. The scenario was specified with simple initial and boundary conditions so that the influence of uncertainty of these conditions was minimized and the variability in the codes‟ results is more readily determine...|$|R

The transverse centroid and spatial {{orientation of the}} luminosity ellipsoid reliably monitor IP orbit drifts. The longitudinal centroid is sensitive to small variations in the average relative RF phase of the beams and provides a detailed measurement of the phase transient along the bunch train. The longi-tudinal luminosity distribution depends on the e+, − over-lap bunch length and the vertical IP β-functions. Relative variations in horizontal luminous size are detectable at the micron level. In addition to continuous on-line monitoring of all the parameters above, we performed detailed stud-ies of their variation along the bunch train to investigate a temporary luminosity degradation. We also compare β ∗y measurements, collected over a year of high-luminosity op-eration, with HER and LER lattice functions measured by resonant transverse excitation.

The final design of the overall system is reported as well as the status of the component design, acquisition, and manufacturing. An overview of the RHIC head-on beam-beam compensation project is given in [1], and more details in [2]. With 2 head-on beam-beam interactions in IP 6 and IP 8, a third interaction with a low-energy electron beam is added near IP 10 to partially compensate the the head-on beam-beam effect. Two electron lenses are under construction, one for each ring. Both will be located in a region common to both beams, but each lens will act only on one beam. With head-on beam-beam compensation up to a factor of two improvement in luminosity is expected together with a polarized source upgrade. The current RHIC polarized proton performance is <b>documented</b> in <b>Ref.</b> [4]. An electron lens (Fig. 1) consists of an DC electron gun, warm solenoids to focus the electron beam during transport, a superconducting main solenoid in which the interaction with the proton beam occurs, steering magnets, a collector, and instrumentation.

However, decadal plans by the RHIC experiments STAR and PHENIX show a continuing interest at both 100 GeV and 250 GeV, and a larger proton beam size has been accommodated in the design (Tab. 1).

40|$|Recently {{the results}} from many Monte Carlo codes were {{compared}} {{for a series of}} theoretical pin-cells; the results are <b>documented</b> in <b>ref.</b> [3]; details are also provided here in Appendix A and B. The purpose of this earlier code comparison was primarily to determine how accurately our codes model both bound and free atom neutron thermal scattering. Prior to this study many people assumed that our Monte Carlo transport codes were all now so accurate that they would all produce {{more or less the same}} answers, say for example K-eff to within 0. 1 %. The results demonstrated that in reality we see a rather large spread in the results for even simple scalar parameters, such as K-eff, where we found differences in excess of 2 %, far exceeding many people's expectations. The differences between code results were traced to four major factors, (1) Differences between the sets of nuclear data used. (2) The accuracy of nuclear data processing codes. (3) The accuracy of the models used in our Monte Carlo transport codes. (4) Code user selected input options. Naturally at Livermore we would like to insure that we minimize the effects of these factors. In this report we compare the results using two of our Monte Carlo transport codes: MERCURY [2] and TART [2], with the following constraints designed to address the four points listed above, (1) Both codes used exactly the same nuclear data, namely the TART 2005 data. (2) Each code used its own nuclear data processing code. Even though these two data processing codes are independent, they have been extensively tested to insure the processed output results closely agree. (3) Both used the same nuclear physics models. This required that some physics be turned off in each code, namely, (a) Unresolved resonance energy region self-shielding was turned off in TART, since this is not currently available in MERCURY. (b) Delayed neutrons were treated as prompt in TART, since this is not currently available in MERCURY. (c) Classical, rather than relativistic, kinematics were used in MERCURY, since relativistic kinematics is not currently available in TART. (4) Both codes used the same input options; both modeled the geometry and materials in exactly the same manner; both used the same number of neutron histories to produce results to within comparable statistical accuracy. These constraints were used to test the accuracy of both our nuclear data processing codes and our Monte Carlo transport codes, while avoiding differences due to the use of different sets of nuclear data, since both of our codes used the same TART 2005 data...|$|R

In this framework a working group has been set-up and supported by ENEA, involving scientific personnel at ENEA, at Polytechnic of Milan (Department of Nuclear Engineering – CESNEF) and at University of Pisa (Department of Mechanical, Nuclear and Production Engineering - DIMNP). Specialists in safety assessment and in thermohydraulics are part of the working group. Following the first meeting ‘exploratory activities’ have been conducted by each of the three branches (i. e. ENEA, CESNEF and DIMNP) of the working group, with the aim of identifying a common way for the study and of finalizing the PSA-TH Project proposed by the ENEA. The ‘exploratory activity’ performed at DIMNP is <b>documented</b> in <b>ref.</b> [1] (see also App. 4 of the present report). At {{the end of the year}} 1999, a draft procedure was agreed within the group. The procedure and the results from its application are discussed in the report. The attention was focused toward passive systems. The general objective of the activity was to characterize the transient thermalhydraulic performance of the passive system in probabilistic terms. A natural circulation loop including an Isolation Condenser and the Reactor Pressure Vessel where power production occurs, has been selected for the analysis. The following steps of the procedure can be distinguished: (a) Characterization of design/operational status for the system, (b) Characterization of parameters that are critical for the operation of the system, (c) Assigning probability values to the status and to the parameters from steps (a) and (b), (d) Modeling of the system by a qualified thermal-hydraulic system code, (e) Performing a best estimate calculation and assigning failure criteria for the system performance, (f) Deterministic selection of sets of boundary and initial conditions (6 sets), (g) Statistic selection of sets of boundary and initial conditions – discrete probability distribution (69 sets), (h) Statistic selection of sets of boundary and initial conditions – continuous probability distribution (69 sets), (i) Association of each set to a code run (each set is also characterized by a probability value) and execution of 144 code runs (6 + 69 + 69), (j) Based upon failure criteria defined under item (e) and upon results of code calculations, item (i), system performance indicators could be derived (these consisted of ensembles of tables and plots). The deterministic selection, item (f), combined with each of the statistic selections, items (g) or (h), causes the achievement of two ensembles of system performance indicators. ‘Curves of merit’ for the system performance are significant results achieved from the application of the procedure. These are assumed to be characteristic of the selected thermalhydraulic system and can be used to judge the system acceptability and to compare the selected system with different systems...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{potential}} of air transportation {{as a means}} of filling the growing need for a mass short haul transportation system was investigated in Ref. 1 where all aspects of short haul air transportation systems were examined in some detail. It was concluded that air transportation could provide a promising means of relieving the congestion associated with the heavy vehicular ground traffic encountered on our urban access routes and at a cost which could well be competitive in the 1970 period with surface transportation systems. This conclusion was postulated on the basis of existing developments in the aircraft industry not yet put into practice on operating airlines but whose feasibility has been well demonstrated with experimental units. Among the many aspects of the total system which must be examined in arriving at such a conclusion are the flight vehicle characteristics. The direct operating costs (DOC) of these vehicles was chosen as a measure of their effectiveness. In short haul operations the direct costs are frequently less important than indirect costs in determining total transportation costs and hence ticket price. However the DOC is a convenient measure for estimating the relative performance of different vehicle configurations and of the penalties associated with operation off optimum conditions. Furthermore, the previous study (Ref. 1) had quantified the almost obvious need in short haul transportation for a vehicle capable of operating from highly congested areas and requiring a minimum in take-off, landing or cleared approach areas. This need directed attention to the newer concepts of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft which would not have the speed limitation of present day helicopters, the only VTOL aircraft currently in commercial operations. Because present day experience with these aircraft indicates their direct operating costs to be several times that of comparable fixed wing aircraft, there has been a natural reluctance to predict future operating costs for these vehicles at a level which would make them effective other than in a high-priced specialized operation such as an airline feeder system. Consequently, in Ref. (1), a study of the costs and operating procedures of the existing helicopter airlines was conducted in some depth and by this means the predicted direct operating costs were removed from the realm of discussion and opinion and reduced to a matter of statistics and analysis. Maintenance costs and lost time in air and ground maneuvering were, as expected, important aspects of the cost problem and these were therefore analyzed on a quantitative basis. While there may still be room for disagreement on the predicted DOC for the various vehicles considered in this study, the quantitative information on which these are based have been carefully <b>documented</b> in <b>Ref.</b> (1) and are further substantiated in Ref. (2) for the maintenance aspects and in this report for the vehicle characteristics such as weight, fuel burned and block speeds. This additional documentation has been considered desirable not only to confirm the previous results and to explore other promising configurations, but also to provide a basis for rational discussion of the relative merits and potentials of different vehicle configurations which all too often in the past has been conducted on a subjective rather than an objective basis. - 3 - It may be well to reiterate the conclusion of Ref. (1) that, in face of the high indirect costs inherent in short haul systems, the actual vehicle configuration is not a dominant factor in determining total operating costs. Any well engineered configuration capable of safe all weather operations would probably prove satisfactory. However the need for direct access to city centers with a minimum of land taking does indicate the desirability of VTOL. These vehicles have the potential for appreciably reducing block times, and hence costs, in the shorter legs, below 50 miles, of interest in intra urban or suburban travel, providing present concepts of control and navigation currently under intensive development for military applications can be reduced to practice in the more legalistic environment of commercial operations.
