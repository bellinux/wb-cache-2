5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it <b>hung</b> <b>a</b> pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E

The seat of Waterford city {{was one of the}} few outside Ulster not to be won by Sinn Féin in the 1918 general election. Redmond's son William Redmond represented the City until his death in 1932. A later Irish Taoiseach (prime minister), John Bruton, <b>hung</b> <b>a</b> painting of Redmond, whom he regarded as his hero because of his commitment to non-violence in Ireland, in his office in Ireland's Leinster House Government Buildings. However, his successor Bertie Ahern replaced the painting with one of Patrick Pearse.|$|E

25|$|Her {{outer garment}} {{was a bright}} colored plaid worsted cloak {{reaching}} to within about six inches of the floor. Its size was most voluminous, but its fashion was extremely simple. It had a wide yoke across the shoulders, into which the broad plain breadths were gathered; and it was fastened at the throat by a huge ornamented brass hook and eye, from which <b>hung</b> <b>a</b> short chain of round twisted links. Her right arm protruded through a vertical slit {{at the side of}} the cloak and she held in her hand a sheet of paper covered with figures. The left arm on which she carried a large basket or bag — I couldn't tell which — was hidden by the ample folds of the garment. Her countenance was keen and nervous, but benignant.|$|E
25|$|A {{long time}} ago some young lads herded sheep on Hesselberg. At that {{time there was a}} deep cave on the mountain, which is buried today. Bursting with curiosity they wanted to know what was inside. One of them was lowered by rope down into the deep hole. Beforehand the boys had decided to pull him up {{immediately}} when he gave a tug on the rope. Soon after the boy went into the cave, a three-legged rabbit hobbled across the way, the other lads followed it spontaneously in order to catch it, but the farther they chased the faster the rabbit ran. Finally they gave up. When they returned to the cave they remembered their fellow in the hole and they immediately pulled the rope up. It was stained with blood and at its end there <b>hung</b> <b>a</b> goat's hoof, but the boy was gone forever.|$|E
25|$|On 20 August 1929, off {{the coast}} of New Jersey, a biplane hooked itself to the bottom of a {{dirigible}} and was carried along by the larger craft. This is the 2nd such incident. The “snapon, snapoff” experiment is accomplished by the Navy airship , under Lt. Com. Herbert Wiley, and a Navy biplane. The biplane, regulating its speed to that of the dirigible, flew close under the Los Angeles. A large hook had been attached {{to the middle of the}} top wing of the biplane, and from the bottom of the Los Angeles <b>hung</b> <b>a</b> U-shaped yoke. Maneuvering the ship under the dirigible, the plane pilot slipped the hook into the Los Angeles’ yoke and for 3 or 4 minutes the dirigible carried the biplane. The plane pilot, by a cord arrangement in his cabin, withdrew the hook from the yoke and flew clear of the dirigible.|$|E

25|$|Cod {{has been}} an {{important}} economic commodity in international markets since the Viking period (around 800 AD). Norwegians traveled with dried cod and soon a dried cod market developed in southern Europe. This market has lasted for more than 1,000 years, enduring the Black Death, wars and other crises, and is still an important Norwegian fish trade. The Portuguese began fishing cod in the 15th century. Clipfish is widely enjoyed in Portugal. The Basques {{played an important role in}} the cod trade, and allegedly found the Canadian fishing banks before Columbus' discovery of America. The North American east coast developed in part due to the vast cod stocks. Many cities in the New England area are located near cod fishing grounds. The fish was so important to the history and development of Massachusetts, the state's House of Representatives <b>hung</b> <b>a</b> wood carving of a codfish, known as the Sacred Cod of Massachusetts, in its chambers.|$|E
25|$|Hung found renewed {{success in}} Hong Kong film {{industry}} in the 2000s, beginning with The Legend of Zu (2001), the long-awaited sequel to the 1983 hit Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain. In 2004, Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle was released. Though Yuen Woo-ping was credited for the martial arts choreography on Kung Fu Hustle, Hung actually did the preliminary work but left the film midway through, and Yuen filled in to complete it. Because of his departure from the film, there was tabloid speculation that he and Chow had strong differences over the film, resulting in their separation. Chow has since responded that Hung left for personal reasons and not because of speculated tensions. In 2004, Hung again worked with Jackie Chan, in a brief but notable appearance in Disney's Around the World in 80 Days as the legendary folk hero Wong Fei <b>Hung,</b> <b>a</b> character played by Chan in the Drunken Master series.|$|E
