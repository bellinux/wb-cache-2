25|$|Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 codeine is a Class B {{controlled}} substance or a Class A drug when prepared for injection. The possession of {{controlled substance}}s {{without a prescription}} is a criminal offence. However, certain preparations of codeine are exempt from this restriction under Schedule 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001. It is thus legal to possess codeine without a prescription, provided that it is compounded {{with at least one}} other active or inactive ingredient and that the dosage of each tablet, capsule, etc. does not exceed 100mg or 2.5% concentration in the case of liquid preparations. The exemptions <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> apply to any preparation of codeine designed for injection.|$|E
500|$|Vincent Canby {{began his}} review {{by calling the}} film [...] "very {{beautiful}} and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years. It's also so full of violence--of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story—that it's going to prompt {{a lot of people}} who do not know the real effect of movie violence (as I <b>do</b> <b>not)</b> <b>to</b> write automatic condemnations of it." [...] He said, [...] "Although the movie's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos, corruption, and defeat". Among the actors, he commented particularly on William Holden: [...] "After years of giving bored performances in boring movies, Holden comes back gallantly in The Wild Bunch. He looks older and tired, but he has style, both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he's always done, not because he really wants the money but because there's simply nothing else to do." [...] Time also liked Holden's performance, describing it as his best since Stalag 17 (a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar); said Robert Ryan gave [...] "the screen performance of his career"; and concluded that [...] "The Wild Bunch contains faults and mistakes" [...] (such as flashbacks [...] "introduced with surprising clumsiness"), but [...] "its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah, along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn, belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 1945, Maria Antonescu {{was taken}} into custody by the Soviet {{occupation}} forces, and, like her husband before her, was transported into Soviet territory, where she was only interrogated once. They were not told of each other, even though their cells at Moscow's Lubyanka are said to have shared a wall. Maria Antonescu returned in April 1946, {{at the same time as}} her husband. She was submitted to interrogations by Interior Ministry Secretary, Romanian Communist Party member and public investigator Avram Bunaciu, who recorded her views on Antonescu's political choices. Part of the inquiry focused on Maria Antonescu's own involvement. When asked about her support for a war of aggression, which Bunaciu defined as [...] "a war of plunder", she replied: [...] "When I started [...] there was no war. What was I to <b>do?</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> keep going? I originally started because of all the misery in the Romanian land." [...] She denied accusations of having participated in extortion, but admitted to having received funds from Lecca, and replied that she had never considered providing aid to Transnistrian deportees because Jews had [...] "enough funds", and denied knowledge that Jews had been imprisoned in concentration camps.|$|E
2500|$|With the line-up secured, Red {{entered a}} {{longtime}} association with producer, songwriter, and musician Rob Graves. After they had recorded four demos {{in a garage}} and a nursery that displayed their style of alternative, hard and Christian rock music. Rauch, who had worked as an intern in the same Nashville studio as Graves and supplied them with free equipment, invited Graves {{to listen to their}} music for his opinions. Graves recalled: [...] "It was really rough, all over the map, but I could hear the elements were there ... I told them it was really good, it had potential". Graves took them under his wing, and paid for studio time and the production of their first demos at Paragon Studios which happened across two years. Graves then signed Red to a development contract with his independent production company Six Feet Over, which led to a recording deal with Provident Label Group which then assigned them to its Christian label Essential Records after they liked their demo. Essential gave Red the green-light on a full length album. Speaking on their Christian influence, Barnes said: [...] "We are Christians in a band, but if people feel more comfortable and say that we are a Christian band, we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> shy away from that". Hendrix parted ways with Red before recording began; he was replaced by drummer Hayden Lamb.|$|E
