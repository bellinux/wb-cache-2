40|$|In this thesis, {{the filling}} and {{compaction}} process in Sandvik Coromant’s production of inserts {{has been studied}} with the goal to determine which factors causes weight and shape variations. The study is based on previous research [1 - 4] in which the powder flow and the packing of the powder is studied with a model <b>die</b> <b>shoe</b> filling system. This study is more complex, taking also the compaction into account and a Fette MP 120 press is used instead of a model. The factors which were confirmed to affect the final shape of the inserts were the fill-shoe velocity, the geometry of the die, the morphology of the powder and if a shaking motion {{was added to the}} fill-shoe or not. It was proven that to minimize the shape irregularities, really high fill-shoe velocities should be avoided. Since different powders have different flow rates, the fill-shoe velocity should be changed depending on which powder is being used. The fill-shoe velocity should also be lower for narrow die geometries since they are harder to fill. Finally, it is good to add a shaking motion to the fill-shoe because it increases the fill density. A different type of powder filling was tested called suction filling. This method turned out to take longer, give the same weight variations between the inserts as the regular filling method and is only able to be used for {{less than half of the}} inserts produced at Sandvik because it can only fill negative geometries...|$|E

50|$|In some neighborhoods, shoes tied {{together}} and hanging from power lines or tree branches signify {{that someone has}} <b>died.</b> The <b>shoes</b> belong to the dead person. The reason they are hanging, legend has it, {{is that when the}} dead person's spirit returns, it will walk that high above the ground, that much closer to heaven. Another superstition holds that the tossing of shoes over the power lines outside of a house is a way to keep the property safe from ghosts. Yet another legend suggests that shoes hanging from telephone wires signal someone leaving the neighborhood onto bigger and better things.|$|R

50|$|French Shoes was a {{shoe chain}} {{headquartered}} in Montreal, Quebec. It began in 1956 and its last location {{closed in the}} 1990s. French Shoes featured very stylish women shoes at an affordable price and grew to 30 locations located mostly in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. The founder of French Shoes was Seymour (Sonny) Lubin (1932-2009). In the early years, he was joined by Gerard Gingras and the two were an excellent team in the Canadian ladies shoe fashion industry. The company was sold in 1979 to Bata Shoes which made the purchase to enter a higher grade of shoe market. However, the acquisition was not successful and the brand was sold again {{a few years to}} later to Calderone Shoes, a large Toronto shoe company. Calderone Shoes eventually fell into hard times, and the French Shoes legend and name <b>died.</b> However, French <b>Shoes</b> was an exciting place to be in Montreal from the early 1960s to late 1970s and will always be remembered fondly.|$|R

Tressilian did so, and after some inarticulate murmurs, in which the names of Varney and Lady Leicester were alone distinguishable, Lambourne bade him [...] "make haste, or he would come too late."

[...] A convulsion verified his words a few minutes after, and the travellers derived nothing from having met with him, saving the obscure fears concerning the fate of the Countess, which his dying words were calculated to convey, and which induced them to urge their journey with the utmost speed, pressing horses in the Queen's name when those which they rode became unfit for service.|$|R
40|$|Powder {{compaction}} is {{a commonly}} used process in many {{industries such as}} powder metallurgy, pharmaceuticals and catalysts manufacturing. A homogeneous packing of powder bed in the die is an important prerequisite for consistent final products. Heterogeneities of packing such as pores, agglomerates or segregations can be induced during the die filling step. During die filling a powder is delivered from a feeding container (e. g. shoe) into a confined die and going from a quasi-static to dynamic flow. Both powder nature (particle size distribution, shape, cohesion) and die system design (atmosphere, <b>die</b> shape, <b>shoe</b> speed etc.) can influence the filling performance. Freeman and Xu[1] showed recently that the die filling performance can be predicted by measures of powder flow properties in an FT 4 powder rheometer (Freeman Technology, Malvern, UK; hereby referred to as FT 4). Recently, the Freeman FT 4 powder rheometer has become an increasingly popular device for studying the flowability of particulate materials by measuring the flow energy. Measuring flow energy consists of a dynamic test regime, in which the flow resistance encountered for an impeller moving within a powder bed is assessed. The FT 4 has potential {{for use as a}} quantitative support tool for process design or a possible calibration tool for DEM simulations[2]. The downward dynamic test on the FT 4, which provides a measure of basic flow energy (BFE), produces shear whilst compacting the sample and was found to be highly differentiating, particularly for non-cohesive powders. Meanwhile, the upward dynamic test, which provides a measure of specific energy (SE), does not compact the sample and correlated well with shear cell results. In this study, both the BSE and SE measurements were conducted in the FT 4 powder rheometer using different types of alumina powders; BSE and SE tests were modelled correspondingly using a discrete element method. Particle properties such static and rolling friction coefficients, cohesion energy density, density were varied until the modelled BSE and SE values match the experimental values. Finally, die filling was simulated using these fitted values and the calculated filling behaviour compared with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a {{computational}} intelligence (CI) technique named flexible neural tree (FNT) {{was developed to}} predict die filling performance of pharmaceutical granules and to identify significant die filling process variables. FNT resembles feedforward neural network, which creates a tree-like structure by using genetic programming. To improve accuracy, FNT parameters were optimized by using differential evolution algorithm. The performance of the FNT-based CI model was evaluated and compared with other CI techniques: multilayer perceptron, Gaussian process regression, and reduced error pruning tree. The accuracy of the CI model was evaluated experimentally using die filling as a case study. The die filling experiments were performed using a model shoe system and three different grades of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) powders (MCC PH 101, MCC PH 102, and MCC DG). The feed powders were roll-compacted and milled into granules. The granules were then sieved into samples of various size classes. The mass of granules deposited into the <b>die</b> at different <b>shoe</b> speeds was measured. From these experiments, a dataset consisting true density, mean diameter (d 50), granule size, and shoe speed as the inputs and the deposited mass as the output was generated. Cross-validation (CV) methods such as 10 FCV and 5 x 2 FCV were applied to develop and to validate the predictive models. It {{was found that the}} FNT based CI model (in the cases of both CV methods) performed much better than other CI models. Additionally, it was observed that process variables such as the granule size and the shoe speed had a higher impact on the predictability than that of the powder property such as d 50. Furthermore, validation of model prediction with experimental data showed that the die filling behavior of coarse granules could be better predicted than that of fine granules...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{numerical}} {{investigation of}} die filling and powder transfer within discrete element method framework is presented. The {{main focus of}} the work is to explore the contribution of die filling and powder transfer processes towards the density variation of the powder mass before compaction. The numerical investigations are carried out to provide alternative solutions in understanding die filling and powder transfer mechanisms {{because of the lack of}} theoretical and experimental solutions in the two fields. Validation of the code used was successfully carried out by comparing simulation results with the existing results of powder flow experiments conducted in controlled environment which imitate realistic industrial settings. The effects of shoe kinematics, punch kinematics, contact parameters, modelling parameters, die geometry, <b>die</b> orientation, and <b>shoe</b> volume on <b>die</b> filling and powder transfer have been identified. It has been confirmed that multiple passes, multiple shoe columns and powder shifting can improve powder packing. The die fill is found to decrease with the increase in friction and cohesion. On the contrary, it increases with the increase of damping. The combination of slow shoe speed during filling and slow punch speed during transfer is found to result in homogeneous powder packing inside the die. The research has also successfully integrated die filling and powder transfer in one continuous sequence in a three dimensional setting. Simulation works have also been performed on the Variable Aperture Flowmeter to evaluate the effects of particle composition on critical aperture and angle of repose, and to determine powder flow rate. Investigations were also conducted on the bridging phenomena which conclude that bridging for monodispersed circular particles stops when the orifice is set at 5. 5 particle width. The result however may change with different values of contact parameters and particle properties. Numerical study performed has shown that the discrete element method is capable of reproducing several key phenomena observed in die filling and powder transfer processes and to some extent capable of characterising powder flow in a simulated variable aperture flowmeter...|$|R
