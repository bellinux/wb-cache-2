5|$|At the ten-minute mark, Sinden {{noticed that}} the Soviets had changed their style, playing defence to protect the lead, rather than pressing.

5|$|In The Ethnostate, Robertson {{declares}} polyethnicity as {{an ideal}} that only lessens each culture. He believes that, within a polyethnic culture, the nation or region {{as a whole is}} less capable of cultural culmination than each of the individual ethnicities that make <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> Essentially, polyethnicity promotes the dilution of ethnicity and thus hinders each ethnicity in all aspects of culture.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President: Politics for Ordinary Radicals is a 2008 book co-written by Evangelical authors Shane Claiborne and Chris Haw, two {{important}} figures in New Monasticism.

5000|$|The 2008 fall in {{the value}} of {{sterling}} against the euro saw the price gap between North and South widen and shoppers cross to Northern Ireland to the detriment of businesses in the South. Coughlan asked multiple retailers to reduce their margins south of the border and provide better value to consumers in the South. Research from Forfás, concluded that only a five per cent difference in the cost of goods between North and South was justifiable. The findings highlighted retailers' larger margins in the South in relation to their operations in the North and Coughlan queried why the price differential in many identical goods was substantially in excess of 5%. Coughlan said: [...] "I don't own a shop. The Government doesn't own a shop. <b>It's</b> <b>up</b> to Tesco, <b>it's</b> <b>up</b> to Superquinn, <b>it's</b> <b>up</b> to Aldi, <b>it's</b> <b>up</b> to Lidl; <b>it's</b> <b>up</b> to them to cut their prices. They need to ensure that that happens; they {{have to do something about}} it." [...] When retailers continued to remain silent on the price differential, Coughlan sent in the Competition Authority to investigate supply chains in the retail sector.|$|R
