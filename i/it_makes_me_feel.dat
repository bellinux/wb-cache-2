I see my new look as very {{innocent}} and feminine and unadorned. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> good. Growing up, I admired {{the kind of}} beautiful glamorous woman—from Brigitte Bardot to Grace Kelly—who doesn't seem to be around much anymore. I think it's time {{for that kind of}} glamor to come back. In pop music generally, people have one image. You get pigeonholed. I'm lucky {{enough to be able to}} change and still be accepted. If you think about it, that's what they do in the movies; play a part, change characters, looks and attitudes. I guess I do it to entertain myself." ...|$|E
500|$|For [...] "Dangerous Woman" [...] music video, Grande shot two {{different}} versions. Grande previewed the accompanying music video {{for the single}} through social media on March 26, 2016 and March 29, 2016. The clip was officially premiered on Vevo in the night of March 31, 2016. Directed by production company The Young Astronauts. In interview with Idolator, Grande explained: “We’re doing two visuals because this song makes me feel two kinds of ways, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> sexy and glamorous — I {{wanted to do a}} simpler more glam-themed video — and then I wanted to do another video because it makes me feel… like a super version of myself in a way.” Discussing the song with Madeline Rotj from MTV, Grande stated about the concept behind the song's second video: ...|$|E
500|$|She visited troops, hospitals, factories, {{and parts}} of Britain that were {{targeted}} by the German Luftwaffe, in particular the East End, near London's docks. Her visits initially provoked hostility; rubbish was thrown at her and the crowds jeered, in part because she wore expensive clothes that served to alienate her from people suffering the deprivations of war. She explained that if the public came to see her they would wear their best clothes, so she should reciprocate in kind; Norman Hartnell dressed her in gentle colours and avoided black to represent [...] "the rainbow of hope". When Buckingham Palace itself took several hits {{during the height of}} the bombing, Elizabeth was able to say, [...] "I'm glad we've been bombed. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> I can look the East End in the face." ...|$|E

Nor did <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> better when {{the youngest of}} the victims, hearing the executioner's words, flung himself upon his knees, and began to implore me to spare him. His grandfather also addressed me, saying: ...|$|R

500|$|MacLachlan did {{not like}} the bomber training. In a letter to his mother he {{described}} his grievances, [...] "We have started bombing today. It's awful! You have to lie on your belly and look through the trapdoor {{in the bottom of the}} plane [...] All the hot oily air from the radiator blows straight into your face. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> quite sick!". He was enthusiastic about describing the mathematical problems associated with aerial bombing and the use of cameras to judge accuracy rather than using live-munitions, but MacLachlan was more enamoured with air-to-air gunnery. He wrote of his training, [...] "I have been doing air-to-air gunnery with the front guns today. It is super!" [...] Live ammunition was used at the end of the training. MacLachlan was permitted to train using 16 bombs, which cost £1 1s each.|$|E
500|$|In September 1939, Britain and the self-governing Dominions {{other than}} Ireland {{declared}} war on Nazi Germany. George VI and his wife resolved to stay in London, despite German bombing raids. They officially stayed in Buckingham Palace throughout the war, although they usually spent nights at Windsor Castle. The {{first night of the}} Blitz on London, on 7 September 1940, killed about one thousand civilians, mostly in the East End. On 13 September, the King and Queen narrowly avoided death when two German bombs exploded in a courtyard at Buckingham Palace while they were there. In defiance, the Queen famously declared: [...] "I am glad we have been bombed. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> we can look the East End in the face." [...] The royal family were portrayed as sharing the same dangers and deprivations {{as the rest of the}} country. They were subject to rationing restrictions, and U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt remarked on the rationed food served and the limited bathwater that was permitted during a stay at the unheated and boarded-up Palace. In August 1942, the King's brother, Prince George, Duke of Kent, was killed on active service.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said March, [...] "I wish <b>it</b> didn't <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> so sneaking. What a {{long day}} it's been! It seems like a century since I got up." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{was not yet}} satisfied. [...] "I wish you'd let me drop around to-morrow or {{next day}} and see how you all are. <b>It</b> would <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> a whole lot better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't it? But <b>it</b> just <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> that way. <b>It's</b> brave. Now {{the houses}} and streets and things in the city aren't brave. But this is. I don't know why. It just is." ...|$|R
2500|$|Steele {{stated in}} a 2003 {{interview}} that he was bipolar, and linked his mood swings to the types of songs he wrote. He also suffered from clinical depression {{for which he had}} received occasional psychiatric treatment. During a 2007 interview Steele explained:"I've always been a very depressed person, but that's only one side of me, you know. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> better when I can express my depression, my anger, my frustration through music... sonic therapy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{claiming}} {{that she would}} never return to EastEnders in 1997, Lawrence was upset when she discovered that both Sid Owen and Mike Reid (Ricky and Frank) were leaving EastEnders in 2000 as, in her opinion, it ruled out any chance of her character returning to the show. She commented, [...] "It would be great fun to get all the Butcher clan back for a few months. I hear Diane's name mentioned quite a lot on the show — <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> like I've never really left. But all the people I'm connected with are leaving, which makes going back harder and I'm really sorry about that. It would be great to have the Butcher clan come back for Mike's sendoff. But, sadly, I don't think there is the space for me to go back full-time." [...] In 2002, she was asked if she would ever return to the soap and she responded, [...] "If they asked me, I’d love to go back. Not on a long term contract or anything because I love doing other things but I’d definitely like to go back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yearwood {{has found}} major {{influences}} {{in a variety}} of musical artists. She grew accustomed to influence from Southern rock bands, which include The Allman Brothers, Eagles, as well as country rock artists such as Emmylou Harris, Elvis Presley, and James Taylor. Yearwood stated that her primary musical influence is Linda Ronstadt, whom Yearwood had often been identified and compared within her albums. Yearwood says, [...] "She had a power and an emotion in her voice that made you believe every word she sang. My favorite song was probably 'Love Has No Pride,' but I listened to everything over and over. I knew the albums so well I knew which song it was from the first note." [...] She had recorded some of Ronstadt's compositions, including [...] "Try Me Again" [...] for her 2000 album, Real Live Woman. Yearwood said that she has never considered herself as a songwriter, but is precise about choosing songs that she can relate to. She stated, [...] "I always select music based on emotion, how <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel,</b> even before I made records. My producer, Garth Fundis, and I have to catch ourselves if we begin to think about recording a song we don't believe in just because we think it might be a hit." [...] She also stated that even though she does not record any of her own material, she has written music that still has yet to be recorded.|$|E

2500|$|Maggie Stands Looking {{was one of}} Captain Pratt’s model students. Maggie {{dictated}} {{this letter}} to an interpreter for publication: [...] "Carlisle Barracks, PA, Jan. 24, 1881. My dear father: AMERICAN HORSE:- I {{want to tell you}} something, and <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> very glad. You tell me that my brother is married and that makes me feel very glad. My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when. I {{want to tell you that}} some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want to say now. Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E
