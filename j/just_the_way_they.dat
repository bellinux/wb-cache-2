25|$|After a {{few months}} of being together, happy and in love, Robin has a {{pregnancy}} scare. Although the test is negative, she realizes she wants different things from life than Patrick. She wants more from him (children), while he is happy <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> are. They eventually break up. Robin wants to be a mother and decides to be a single mom. She and her friend, Dr. Kelly Lee (Minae Noji), put a list of possible sperm donors together. Robin picks people in Port Charles, because she feels that they have redeeming qualities she will like to pass on to her child, and does not like the idea of her child's father being a stranger. On November 30, 2007, Patrick tells Robin that he still loves and misses her. He just wants them to be together again and asks her to table the discussion of children for a year, and while she has stated that she has never been happier than when she was with him, she knows nothing would be different in a year - she would still want kids and he would not, to which he sadly replies that she is probably right, {{but it would have been}} a great year.|$|E

Farrell {{was attached to the}} role in December 2001. Mark Steven Johnson credits Joe Quesada with talking him out of using the traditional Bullseye costume for the film, and Farrell was encouraged to keep his Irish accent as this version of Bullseye is from Ireland. Farrell had to read Frank Miller's Daredevil comics to understand Bullseye [...] "because the expression on the character's faces in the comic books, and <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> move sometimes, and the exaggerations of the character I'm playing [...] he's so over-the-top that you do draw from that. But it's not exactly a character you can do method acting for... you know, running around New York killing people with paper clips." ...|$|E
500|$|Farrell's {{supporting}} roles {{include an}} ambitious Justice Department agent opposite Tom Cruise, a potential criminal in Minority Report (2002), and the villain Bullseye in Daredevil (2003). Matt Damon was originally offered the Minority Report role, turning {{it down to}} appear in Ocean's Eleven. Farrell said [...] "he had no problem" [...] being the producer's fallback after Damon declined. Bullseye is an assassin, proud of his accuracy. Farrell was signed to the role in December 2001, although he was considered for the lead role of Matt Murdock (Daredevil) until Ben Affleck signed. Farrell was encouraged to keep his Irish accent, since this version of Bullseye is from Ireland. He read Frank Miller's Daredevil comics to understand Bullseye [...] "because the expression on the character's faces in the comic books, and <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> move sometimes, and the exaggerations of the character I'm playing...he's so over-the-top that you do draw from that.

500|$|Ken Keeler, Bill Oakley, and Josh Weinstein all {{defend the}} episode in its DVD commentary. Keeler asserts, [...] "I am very, {{very proud of}} the job I did on this episode. This is the best episode of {{television}} I feel I ever wrote." [...] He describes the episode as a commentary on [...] "people who like things <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> are", and remarks, [...] "It never seems to have occurred to anyone that this episode is about the people who hate it." [...] However, Keeler says that some of the dialogue was changed from his original draft, making this point less obvious. Oakley and Weinstein explain that they wanted to push the boundaries of the series while working as show-runners, and advise viewers to treat [...] "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] as an [...] "experiment". They surmise that the negative reception was partly {{due to the fact that}} it was not immediately apparent to viewers that this was such an episode (as opposed to, for example, [...] "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"). They also describe the ending of the episode as an attempt to reset the continuity and allow fans to consider the episode as non-canonical, divorced from the larger series.|$|E

50|$|The series {{centered}} on {{the women of the}} Navy (WAVES) circa World War II, who found themselves transferred to an island in the South Pacific to run the motor pool in an otherwise all-male environment. Their nemesis was Commander Adrian, who liked things <b>just</b> fine <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> were and felt that having women around would just louse everything up.

After having pondered the problem for a long time, Blackmore's sense of free will faded: This seems to be all that happens; {{decisions}} are made because of countless interacting events, and afterwards a little voice inside says [...] "I did that", [...] "I decided to do that". Still, Blackmore learned during a Zen retreat that she could take responsibility. Once a decision was made, [...] "That's what happened, these are <b>the</b> consequences.

500|$|Mitford did {{not regard}} {{herself as a}} journalist: nevertheless, her {{articles}} were popular, particularly those she contributed on Paris life to The Sunday Times. Thomson describes this series as [...] "a more sophisticated version of A Year in Provence, bringing France to <b>the</b> English in <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that <b>they</b> most like it". Thompson adds that although Mitford was always a competent writer, it is in her letters, with their freedom of expression and flights of fancy, that her true character emerges. [...] Many have been published within collections; they are, according to The Independents reviewer: [...] "a delight, full of the sparks of an abrasive and entertaining wit, refreshingly free from politeness".|$|R

40|$|This paper seeks an {{explanation}} for the challenges faced by Semantic Web developers in achieving their vision, compared to the staggering near-instantaneous success of the World Wide Web. To this end it contrasts two broad philosophical understandings of meaning and argues that the choice between them carries real consequences for how developers attempt to engineer the Semantic Web. The first is Rene Descartes' "private," static account of meaning (arguably dominant for the last four-hundred years in Western thought), which understands the meanings of signs as whatever their producers intend them to mean. The second is Charles Peirce's still relatively unknown " public," evolutionary account of meaning, according to which the meaning of signs <b>just</b> is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> are interpreted and used to produce further signs. It is argued that only the latter approach can avoid the unmanageable attempts to "preprocess" interpretation of signs on the Web that have dogged the project in its many stages, and thereby do justice to the scale, rapid changeability, and exciting possibilities of online information today...|$|R
