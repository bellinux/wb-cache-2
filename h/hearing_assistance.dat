5000|$|The WHO {{concludes that}} {{limited access to}} <b>hearing</b> <b>assistance</b> can cause {{isolation}} among people with hearing loss, while denying children with hearing loss access to schooling. In addition, unemployment is higher among adults with hearing loss while those who are employed are in lower-paid occupations compared with the general workforce.In the U.S., the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Diseases estimates, hearing aids are used by only about 20 percent of the 36 million Americans who could benefit from one. [...] While two-thirds of this number are {{under the age of}} 65, most do not use hearing aids because they are too expensive or difficult to operate or an unwelcome sign of advancing age.According to Frank Lin, a professor of public health and an ear surgeon at Johns Hopkins University, one problem with the current market for hearing aids is that the supply is dominated by a handful of manufacturers, each using a proprietary technology. This costly approach yields a high-profit, low-volume market strategy. By contrast, Sound World Solutions’ design platform relies on inexpensive off-the-shelf Bluetooth technology, yielding a hearing device that costs less than a tenth the price of a conventional hearing aid.Rather than disguise its hearing device as a hearing aid, Sound World Solutions designed it to look and function as a Bluetooth device, which is common among people without hearing loss.By developing a customizable diagnostic system based on ubiquitous and low-cost cellular telephone technology, the device serves individuals who are not addressed by the conventional hearing aid industry in developed nations, {{as well as in the}} developing world, where it would take many years to develop a network to dispense conventional hearing aids.This business model is based on one created by Green, who worked to establish Aurolab, an Indian company that manufactures intraocular lenses for the treatment of cataracts. By emphasizing volume, Aurolab drove down the price of lenses from several hundred dollars to about $2 each, enabling millions of people to affordably regain their sight.|$|E

40|$|A {{tendency}} toward isolation is arguably {{one of the}} most devastating consequences of hearing loss, and also the most elusive.

As a result, those with hearing loss may forego attending theater and symphony performances or going to the cinema. One of the ways audiologists can play a pivotal role in alleviating patients ’ social fears is by familiarizing them with <b>hearing</b> <b>assistance</b> technology (HAT).

The captain ordered the troop to halt at the {{distance}} of a pistol shot from it; and enjoined profound silence. He then approached the threshold alone with noiseless steps. He examined the outside of the door very narrowly, and then returning precipitately, made a sign for the troop to continue its march in silence.

The innkeeper had an understanding with the captain, as he most probably had with the chiefs of the different bands.

40|$|Introduction: Despite the {{advantages}} of using a hearing aid (HA), only 1 out of 5 individuals who could benefit from a (HA) actually use one (World Health Organization, 2012). If an individual does not use a HA then it may impact on their quality of life, {{as well as others}} around them (Chia et al., 2007). Therefore {{it is important to understand}} why individuals do not use HAs after obtaining them. To date, there has been no study that investigates the reasons for HA disuse in the New Zealand population. Methods: Two groups of adults with hearing impairment were recruited: HA users (N = 35) and HA disusers (N = 35). Six self-report questionnaires, three audiometric tests and two other body function measures were compared between the groups. Results: Several variables differentiated HA users from disusers, these significant variables were: cognition, understanding speech in noise, acceptance of noise, age at testing, education, <b>hearing</b> <b>assistance</b> technology (HAT) use, HA satisfaction, self-efficacy, accepted need, application for HA subsidy, HA outcomes, stages-of-change, perceived environmental influence, follow-up support and hearing related activity limitations/participation restrictions (AL/PR). Discussion: The clinical value of identifying factors related to HA disuse is so clinicians can identify “red flags” for disuse before the client stops using their HAs. By identifying these red flags, rehabilitation can be tailored around the clients’ needs; before the negative consequences of an untreated hearing impairment is felt...|$|E
40|$|Listening effort {{helps explain}} why people who are hard of hearing are prone to fatigue and social withdrawal. However, a one-factor model that cites only effort due to {{hardness}} of hearing is insufficient as {{there are many who}} lead happy lives despite their disability. This paper explores other contributory factors, in particular motivational arousal and pleasure. The theory of rational motivational arousal predicts that some people forego listening comprehension because they believe it to be impossible and hence worth no effort at all. This is problematic. Why should the listening task be rated this way, given the availability of aids that reduce its difficulty? Two additional factors narrow the explanatory gap. First, we separate the listening task from the benefit derived as a consequence. The latter is temporally more distant, and is discounted as a result. The second factor is displeasure attributed to the listening task, which increases listening cost. Many who are hard of hearing enjoy social interaction. In such cases, the actual activity of listening is a benefit, not a cost. These people also reap the benefits of listening, but do not have to balance these against the displeasure of the task. It is suggested that if motivational harmony can be induced by training in somebody who is hard of hearing, then the obstacle to motivational arousal would be removed. This suggests a modified goal for health care professionals. Don’t just teach those who are hard of hearing how to use <b>hearing</b> <b>assistance</b> devices. Teach them how to do so with pleasure and enjoymen...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: This study {{investigated}} the perception of generic and disease-specific Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) for adults living with hearing impairment (HI) in Aotearoa/New Zealand (NZ). This study aimed to answer three questions: (1) What is the perception of HRQoL amongst adults with hearing impairment in NZ? (2) How do these perceptions compare to adults with HI living in other countries for which we have data? (3) What are the demographic and audiometric variables related to device ownership? METHOD: HRQoL, demographic, and audiometric information was collected from 126 adults in NZ. The following demographic information was collected: age, relationship length, hours worked per week, income, ancestry, sex, level of education, city size, and sexual orientation. The following audiologic information was also collected: ownership of hearing aids (HA), ownership of <b>hearing</b> <b>assistance</b> technology (HAT), better-ear pure-tone average (BEPTA), worse-ear pure-tone average (WEPTA), and signal-to-noise ratio loss (SNR loss). HRQoL information was collected using the Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF- 36; Ware & Sherbourne, 1992), and the Hearing Handicap Inventory (HHI) for both elderly (HHIE) and adults (HHIA; Ventry & Weinstein, 1982; Newman, Weinstein, Jacobson, & Hug, 1991). Variables discriminating HA and HAT owners from non-owners were also analysed. RESULTS: The relationship between demographic variables and HRQoL scores revealed that only age and income were significant. Audiometric variables had significant relationships with disease-specific HRQoL scores, as well as HA and HAT ownership. Finally, disease-specific HRQoL scores and all audiometric variables differentiated HA owners from non- owners, but demographic variables did not. Generic HRQoL scores and all audiometric variables differentiated HAT owners from non-owners. CONCLUSIONS: These {{results suggest that the}} negative impacts of HI on HRQoL as reported overseas are also present in NZ, and that not only do audiometric variables including SNR loss are related to HRQoL, but HRQoL is a significant predictor for HA and HAT ownership. Further QoL research is warranted amongst the HI population in NZ to identify and understand any causal relationships present amongst these variables. Furthermore, HRQoL instruments and a test of speech understanding in noise have been shown to provide additional meaningful information, and therefore clinicians might consider including them during consultation...|$|E

The ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Prosecution and Defense Function apparently took the position of preferring the presence of prosecutors in all cases, even those in which a party appears without counsel. The rules assign prosecutors in those cases to protect the rights of the unrepresented accused, effectively casting the prosecutor as a surrogate defense attorney. The article demonstrates the various ways in which prosecutors are charged with protecting arrestees and concludes that time has proven this approach to be unworkable and ineffective in protecting the rights of defendants at bail hearings. In fact, the article argues that defendants would likely be better off if prosecutors were ethically barred from participating in bail hearings unless defense counsel is also provided...|$|R

The study is conducted as a collaboration between the University of Newcastle and the Hunter New England Area Health Service. The first phase of this study sampled 3253 people representing a response rate of 44. 5 %. A follow up survey of the entire cohort is currently being completed (Jan-June 2011). Description of the data Blood collection samples The blood samples include plasma, serum, whole blood, and DNA that have been stored at - 80 degrees Celsius, as well as whole cells cryopreserved in DMSO in liquid nitrogen (- 196 C) for future use. All the blood samples are stored in 1 -ml aliquots to minimize freeze-thaw cycles, which may adversely impact on analyte integrity. One of the more unique samples is whole blood that has been cryopreserved with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) in liquid nitrogen to obtain whole lymphocytes for future cell immortalization (through Epstein-Barr virus transformation) and cytogenetic studies. These samples also allow for assaying biomarkers of genetic damage, in which toxins have affected DNA integrity. These include single- or double-stranded DNA breaks detected using the COMET assay, micronuclei, sister chromatid exchanges and cytogenetic abnormalities, all of which require whole viable cells, not just isolated DNA. Electronic data All files are in SAS format and the total file size is ~ 250 MB. Participants have given consent for linkage to area health databases (for hospitalisations), death registry, and Medicare records. Measures within this study include: demographics (age, education, housing, income, government benefits), morbidity (self-reported diseases) and health professional utilization, use of complementary and alternative medicines and medication, nutrition (use of a Food Frequency Questionnaire), quality of life (using Short Form 36 [SF- 36] and Australian Quality of Life - Mark 2 [AQoL II]), physical activity (using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly [PASE]), mental health (using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale [K 10], Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D] and Memory Assessment Clinic-Q [MAC-Q]), daytime sleepiness (using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale), social support (using the Duke Social Support Index [DSSI]), occupational exposures to more than 40 different classes of toxins (using the Finnish Job Exposure Matrix [FINJEM]), lifetime tobacco use, lifetime alcohol consumption, oral health questionnaire, <b>hearing</b> <b>assistance</b> (using Glasgow Hearing Aid Questionnaire) and spirituality measures (including religion and attendance at places of worship).

40|$|<b>Assistance</b> <b>Hearing</b> Dogs provide {{independence}} {{to people with}} a hearing impairment by alerting to household and danger sounds, and provide companionship {{in a range of}} public places. Hearing Dogs experience thorough socialising and training in order to meet high Assistance Dog standards. Present procedures in use by Hearing Dogs For Deaf People, UK involve an 8 months behavioural test, with the aim to predict each dogs’ future training performance. Knowing the predictive validity of this test, with respect to task performance is of great importance. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive validity of 8 month behaviour tests already in use by the UK charity, Hearing Dogs for Deaf People, for performance at 18 months were evaluated on 62 dogs over a two year period. Correlations between the two tests and significant differences in performance were assessed using Spearman’s Rho and Wilcoxon matched pairs tests. The following 13 behavioural factors were analysed: social behaviour with adults, children and dogs, environmental behaviour, recovery rate, adaptability, vocal reactivity, motivation, trainability, frustration, chase, hunt and distraction. Convergent validity of both the 8 and 18 month behaviour tests was further examined where possible using a CBARQ questionnaire completed at 8 and 18 months by the socialisers and trainers of 12 of the dogs. Positive correlations were observed between all behavioural factors with the exception of distractibility and recovery rate, however overall the behavioural tests demonstrated a high sensitivity and a low specificity, signifying a poor predictive validity with respect to task performance. While these results partly reflect the small number of failures in each test, the findings may also be symptomatic of the continued socialising and training that all dogs, irrelevant of pass rates, undergo between the 8 and 18 month behaviour tests.
