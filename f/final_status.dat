5|$|McKinley {{proposed}} to open negotiations with Spain {{on the basis}} of Cuban liberation and Puerto Rican annexation, with the <b>final</b> <b>status</b> of the Philippines subject to further discussion. He stood firmly in that demand even as the military situation on Cuba began to deteriorate when the American army was struck with yellow fever. Spain ultimately agreed to a ceasefire on those terms on August 12, and treaty negotiations began in Paris in September 1898. The talks continued until December 18, when the Treaty of Paris was signed. The United States acquired Puerto Rico and the Philippines as well as the island of Guam, and Spain relinquished its claims to Cuba; in exchange, the United States agreed to pay Spain $20 million. McKinley had difficulty convincing the Senate to approve the treaty by the requisite two-thirds vote, but his lobbying, and that of Vice President Hobart, eventually saw success, as the Senate voted in favor on February 6, 1899, 57 to 27.|$|E
5|$|Fillmore sent {{a special}} message to Congress on August 6, 1850, {{disclosing}} {{the letter from}} Governor Bell and his reply, warning that armed Texans would be viewed as intruders, and urging Congress to defuse sectional tensions by passing the Compromise. Without the Great Triumvirate of John C. Calhoun, Webster and Clay who had long dominated the Senate, Douglas and others led that body towards the administration-backed package of bills. Each bill passed the Senate {{with the support of}} the section that wanted it, plus a few members who were determined to see all the bills passed. The battle then moved to the House, which had a Northern majority because of population. Most contentious was the Fugitive Slave Bill, whose provisions were anathema to abolitionists. Fillmore applied pressure to get Northern Whigs to abstain rather than oppose, including New Yorkers—threatening to kill the renomination of Congressman Abraham Schermerhorn of Rochester, whose constituents included Frederick Douglass, if he voted against the bill. Through the legislative process, various changes were made, including the setting of a boundary between New Mexico Territory and Texas—the state would be given a payment to settle any claims. California was admitted as a free state, the District slave trade was ended, and the <b>final</b> <b>status</b> of slavery in New Mexico and Utah would be settled later. Fillmore signed the bills as they reached his desk, holding the Fugitive Slave Bill for two days until he received a favorable opinion as to its constitutionality from the new Attorney General, John J. Crittenden. Although some Northerners were unhappy at the Fugitive Slave Act, relief was widespread, as was the hope this would settle the slavery question.|$|E

40|$|Background. Lymph node {{involvement}} in periampullary malignancy {{is the single}} most important factor in predicting survival in pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). The role of nodal sampling in PD has not been well evaluated. This study evaluates the utility of nodal sampling of nodal stations 8 and 12, which are easily dissected early in PD, in overall <b>final</b> nodal <b>status.</b> Patients and methods. Fifty patients underwent PD at a single institution by a one surgeon over a 15 month period. Nodal stations 8 and 12 were sent separately for pathologic evaluation. Twenty-eight patients had a final diagnosis of periampullary malignancy. Demographic and pathologic data were collected retrospectively from patient charts. Positive and negative predictive values of nodes 8 and 12 were evaluated. Results. Eighteen of 28 patients with a diagnosis of periampullary malignancy had pathologically negative nodes 8 and 12, and a <b>final</b> nodal <b>status</b> (all peripancreatic lymph nodes) negative for nodal involvement. Nine of 28 patients had a negative nodal sampling result, but a positive <b>final</b> nodal <b>status</b> for metastatic tumor. The remaining four patients had both positive nodal sampling and <b>final</b> nodal <b>status</b> for metastatic tumor. The negative predictive value of negative nodes 8 and 12 was 0. 625. Conclusion. The negative predictive of a negative node 8 and 12 of 0. 625 suggests that the decision to proceed with or abort PD should not be based on intraoperative evaluation of these nodes. Performance of PD should be undertaken if technically feasible, and not based on intraoperative nodal assessment...|$|R

25|$|A {{majority}} of sovereign states recognise Abkhazia {{as an integral}} part of Georgia and support its territorial integrity according to the principles of international law, although Belarus has expressed sympathy toward the recognition of Abkhazia.

The United Nations has been urging both sides to settle the dispute through diplomatic dialogue and ratifying the <b>final</b> <b>status</b> of Abkhazia in the Georgian constitution. However, the Abkhaz de facto government considers Abkhazia a sovereign country even if it is recognised by few other countries. In early 2000, then-UN Special Representative of the Secretary General Dieter Boden and the Group of Friends of Georgia, consisting of the representatives of Russia, the United States, Britain, France, and Germany, drafted and informally presented a document to the parties outlining a possible distribution of competencies between the Abkhaz and Georgian authorities, based on core respect for Georgian territorial integrity. The Abkhaz side, however, has never accepted the paper as a basis for negotiations. Eventually, Russia also withdrew its approval of the document. In 2005 and 2008, the Georgian government offered Abkhazia a high degree of autonomy and possible federal structure within the borders and jurisdiction of Georgia.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{objectives}} {{of this investigation}} were to compare the initial cephalometric characteristics of complete Class II Division 1 malocclusions treated with 2 or 4 premolar extractions and to verify their influence on the occlusal success rate of these treatment protocols. Methods: A sample of 98 records from patients with complete Class II Division 1 malocclusion was divided into 2 groups with the following characteristics: group 1 consisted of 55 patients treated with 2 maxillary first premolar extractions at an initial mean age of 13. 07 years; group 2 included 43 patients treated with 4 premolar extractions, with an initial mean age of 12. 92 years. Initial and <b>final</b> occlusal <b>statuses</b> were evaluated on dental casts with Grainger`s treatment priority index (TPI), and the initial cephalometric characteristics {{were obtained from the}} pretreatment cephalograms. The initial cephalometric characteristics and the initial and <b>final</b> occlusal <b>statuses</b> of the groups were compared with the t test. A multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate the influence of all variables in the final TPI. Results: The 2 -premolar extraction protocol provided a statistically smaller TPI and consequently a better occlusal success rate than the 4 -premolar extraction protocol. The 4 -premolar extraction group had statistically smaller apical base lengths, more vertical facial growth patterns, and greater hard- and soft-tissue convexities at pretreatment than the 2 -premolar extraction group. However, the multiple regression analysis showed that only the extraction protocol was significantly associated with the <b>final</b> occlusal <b>status.</b> Conclusions: The initial cephalometric characteristics of the groups did not influence the occlusal success rate of these 2 treatment protocols...|$|R
