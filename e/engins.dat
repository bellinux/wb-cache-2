2500|$|The Jupiter was an {{executive}} transport with between four and seven seats, depending on engine power. [...] It {{was designed by}} André Moynet, {{a member of the}} National Assembly of France and a former government minister, while also a test-pilot, and built by S.S. <b>Engins</b> Matra (so it is sometimes referred to as the Matra Moynet Jupiter), the first prototype flying on 17 December 1963 with the designer and Lucien Tieles at the controls. [...] Its wing had a straight trailing edge, but the centre section had strong taper on the leading edge which continued more weakly outboard. [...] It was of two spar, stressed skin construction, carrying mass balanced ailerons and slotted flaps. [...] The main undercarriage legs, placed {{at the end of the}} centre section each carried a single wheel and retracted inwards electrically. [...] A retractable nosewheel completed the landing gear.|$|E

[...] Not uninvented that, which thou aright [...] Beleivst so main to our success, I bring; [...] Which {{of us who}} beholds {{the bright}} surface [...] Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand, [...] This {{continent}} of spacious Heav'n, adornd [...] With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms & Gold, [...] Whose Eye so superficially surveyes [...] These things, as not to mind from whence they grow [...] Deep under ground, materials dark and crude, [...] Of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht [...] With Heav'ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth [...] So beauteous, op'ning to the ambient light. [...] These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep [...] Shall yeild us, pregnant with infernal flame, [...] Which into hallow <b>Engins</b> long and round [...] Thick-rammd, at th' other bore with touch of fire [...] Dilated and infuriate shall send forth [...] From far with thundring noise among our foes [...] Such implements of mischief as shall dash [...] To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands [...] Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd [...] The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt. [...] Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne, [...] Effect shall end our wish. Mean while revive; [...] Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind [...] Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird. [...] He ended, and his words thir drooping chere [...] Enlightn'd, and thir languisht hope reviv'd. [...] Th' invention all admir'd, and each, how hee [...] To be th' inventer miss'd, so easie it seemd [...] Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought [...] Impossible: yet haply of thy Race [...] In future dayes, if Malice should abound, [...] Some one intent on mischief, or inspir'd [...] With dev'lish machination might devise [...] Like instrument to plague the Sons of men [...] For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent. [...] Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew, [...] None arguing stood, innumerable hands [...] Were ready, in a moment up they turnd [...] Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath [...] Th' originals of Nature in thir crude [...] Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame [...] They found, they mingl'd, and with suttle Art, [...] Concocted and adusted they reduc'd [...] To blackest grain, and into store conveyd: [...] Part hidd'n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth [...] Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone, [...] Whereof to found thir <b>Engins</b> and thir Balls [...] Of missive ruin; part incentive reed [...] Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire. [...] So all ere day spring, under conscious Night [...] Secret they finish'd, and in order set, [...] With silent circumspection unespi'd. [...] Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav'n appeerd [...] Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms [...] The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood [...] Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host, [...] Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills [...] Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure, [...] Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe, [...] Where lodg'd, or whither fled, or if for fight, [...] In motion or in alt: him soon they met [...] Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow [...] But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail [...] ZEPHIEL, of Cherubim the swiftest wing, [...] Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri'd.|$|E

6000|$|So scoffing in {{ambiguous}} words, he scarce [...] Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front [...] Divided, and {{to either}} Flank retir'd. [...] Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange, [...] A triple-mounted row of Pillars laid [...] On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem'd [...] Or hollow'd bodies made of Oak or Firr [...] With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell'd) [...] Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes [...] With hideous orifice gap't on us wide, [...] Portending hollow truce; at each behind [...] A Seraph stood, {{and in his}} hand a Reed [...] Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense, [...] Collected stood within our thoughts amus'd, [...] Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds [...] Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli'd [...] With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame, [...] But soon obscur'd with smoak, all Heav'n appeerd, [...] From those deep-throated <b>Engins</b> belcht, whose roar [...] Emboweld with outragious noise the Air, [...] And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule [...] Thir devillish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail [...] Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host [...] Level'd, with such impetuous furie smote, [...] That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand, [...] Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell [...] By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl'd; [...] The sooner for thir Arms, unarm'd they might [...] Have easily as Spirits evaded swift [...] By quick contraction or remove; but now [...] Foule dissipation follow'd and forc't rout; [...] Nor serv'd it to relax thir serried files. [...] What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse [...] Repeated, and indecent overthrow [...] Doubl'd, would render them yet more despis'd, [...] And to thir foes a laughter; for in view [...] Stood rankt of Seraphim another row [...] In posture to displode thir second tire [...] Of Thunder: back defeated to return [...] They worse abhorr'd. SATAN beheld thir plight, [...] And to his Mates thus in derision call'd.|$|E
6000|$|So they among {{themselves}} in pleasant veine [...] Stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond [...] All doubt of Victorie, eternal might [...] To match with thir inventions they presum'd [...] So easie, {{and of his}} Thunder made a scorn, [...] And all his Host derided, while they stood [...] A while in trouble; but they stood not long, [...] Rage prompted them at length, & found them arms [...] Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. [...] Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power [...] Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac'd) [...] Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills [...] (For Earth hath this variety from Heav'n [...] Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale) [...] Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew, [...] From thir foundations loosning to and fro [...] They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load, [...] Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops [...] Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze, [...] Be sure, and terrour seis'd the rebel Host, [...] When coming towards them so dread they saw [...] The bottom of the Mountains upward turn'd, [...] Till on those cursed <b>Engins</b> triple-row [...] They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence [...] Under the weight of Mountains buried deep, [...] Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads [...] Main Promontories flung, which in the Air [...] Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm'd, [...] Thir armor help'd thir harm, crush't in and brus'd [...] Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain [...] Implacable, and many a dolorous groan, [...] Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind [...] Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, [...] Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. [...] The rest in imitation to like Armes [...] Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore; [...] So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills [...] Hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire, [...] That under ground they fought in dismal shade; [...] Infernal noise; Warr seem'd a civil Game [...] To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt [...] Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav'n [...] Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred, [...] Had not th' Almightie Father where he sits [...] Shrin'd in his Sanctuarie of Heav'n secure, [...] Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen [...] This tumult, and permitted all, advis'd: [...] That his great purpose he might so fulfill, [...] To honour his Anointed Son aveng'd [...] Upon his enemies, and to declare [...] All power on him transferr'd: whence to his Son [...] Th' Assessor of his Throne he thus began.|$|E
6000|$|There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top [...] Belch'd {{fire and}} rowling smoak; the rest entire [...] Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign [...] That in his womb was hid {{metallic}} Ore, [...] The work of Sulphur. Thither wing'd with speed [...] A numerous Brigad hasten'd. As when bands [...] Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm'd [...] Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field, [...] Or cast a Rampart. MAMMON led them on, [...] MAMMON, the least erected Spirit that fell [...] From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks & thoughts [...] Were always downward bent, admiring more [...] The riches of Heav'ns pavement, trod'n Gold, [...] Then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd [...] In vision beatific: by him first [...] Men also, {{and by his}} suggestion taught, [...] Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands [...] Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth [...] For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew [...] Op'nd into the Hill a spacious wound [...] And dig'd out ribs of Gold. Let none admire [...] That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best [...] Deserve the pretious bane. And here let those [...] Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell [...] Of BABEL, and the works of MEMPHIAN Kings, [...] Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame, [...] And Strength and Art are easily outdone [...] By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour [...] What in an age they with incessant toyle [...] And hands innumerable scarce perform [...] Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd, [...] That underneath had veins of liquid fire [...] Sluc'd from the Lake, a second multitude [...] With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore, [...] Severing each kinde, and scum'd the Bullion dross: [...] A third as soon had form'd within the ground [...] A various mould, and from the boyling cells [...] By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook, [...] As in an Organ from one blast of wind [...] To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths. [...] Anon {{out of the earth}} a Fabrick huge [...] Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound [...] Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet, [...] Built like a Temple, where PILASTERS round [...] Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid [...] With Golden Architrave; nor did there want [...] Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n, [...] The Roof was fretted Gold. Not BABILON, [...] Nor great ALCAIRO such magnificence [...] Equal'd in all thir glories, to inshrine [...] BELUS or SERAPIS thir Gods, or seat [...] Thir Kings, when AEGYPT with ASSYRIA strove [...] In wealth and luxurie. Th' ascending pile [...] Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores [...] Op'ning thir brazen foulds discover wide [...] Within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth [...] And level pavement: from the arched roof [...] Pendant by suttle Magic many a row [...] Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed [...] With Naphtha and ASPHALTUS yeilded light [...] As from a sky. The hasty multitude [...] Admiring enter'd, and the work some praise [...] And some the Architect: his hand was known [...] In Heav'n by many a Towred structure high, [...] Where Scepter'd Angels held thir residence, [...] And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King [...] Exalted to such power, and gave to rule, [...] Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright. [...] Nor was his name unheard or unador'd [...] In ancient Greece; and in AUSONIAN land [...] Men call'd him MULCIBER; and how he fell [...] From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry JOVE [...] Sheer o're the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn [...] To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve, [...] A Summers day; and with the setting Sun [...] Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star, [...] On LEMNOS th' AEGAEAN Ile: thus they relate, [...] Erring; for he with this rebellious rout [...] Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now [...] To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape [...] By all his <b>Engins,</b> but was headlong sent [...] With his industrious crew to build in hell. [...] Mean while the winged Haralds by command [...] Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony [...] And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim [...] A solemn Councel forthwith to be held [...] At PANDAEMONIUM, the high Capital [...] Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call'd [...] From every and Band squared Regiment [...] By place or choice the worthiest; they anon [...] With hundreds and with thousands trooping came [...] Attended: all access was throng'd, the Gates [...] And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall [...] (Though like a cover'd field, where Champions bold [...] Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chair [...] Defi'd the best of Panim chivalry [...] To mortal combat or carreer with Lance) [...] Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air, [...] Brusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees [...] In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides, [...] Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive [...] In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers [...] Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank, [...] The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel, [...] New rub'd with Baume, expatiate and confer [...] Thir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd [...] Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n, [...] Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd [...] In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons [...] Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room [...] Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race [...] Beyond the INDIAN Mount, or Faerie Elves, [...] Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side [...] Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees, [...] Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon [...] Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth [...] Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth & dance [...] Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear; [...] At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds. [...] Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms [...] Reduc'd thir shapes immense, and were at large, [...] Though without number still amidst the Hall [...] Of that infernal Court. But far within [...] And in thir own dimensions like themselves [...] The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim [...] In close recess and secret conclave sat [...] A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat's, [...] Frequent and full. After short silence then [...] And summons read, the great consult began.|$|E

There is a Cave [...] Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne, [...] Where light and darkness in perpetual round [...] Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav'n [...] Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night; [...] Light issues forth, and at the other dore [...] Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre [...] 10 [...] To veile the Heav'n, though darkness there might well [...] Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn [...] Such as in highest Heav'n, arrayd in Gold [...] Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night, [...] Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain [...] Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright, [...] Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds [...] Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view: [...] Warr he perceav'd, warr in procinct, and found [...] Already known what he for news had thought [...] 20 [...] To have reported: gladly then he mixt [...] Among those friendly Powers who him receav'd [...] With joy and acclamations loud, that one [...] That of so many Myriads fall'n, yet one [...] Returnd not lost: On to the sacred hill [...] They led him high applauded, and present [...] Before the seat supream; from whence a voice [...] From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard. [...] Servant of God, well done, well hast thou fought [...] The better fight, who single hast maintaind [...] 30 [...] Against revolted multitudes the Cause [...] Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Armes; [...] And for the testimonie of Truth hast born [...] Universal reproach, far worse to beare [...] Then violence: for this was all thy care [...] To stand approv'd in sight of God, though Worlds [...] Judg'd thee perverse: the easier conquest now [...] Remains thee, aided by this host of friends, [...] Back on thy foes more glorious to return [...] Then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue [...] 40 [...] By force, who reason for thir Law refuse, [...] Right reason for thir Law, and for thir King [...] Messiah, who by right of merit Reigns. [...] Goe Michael of Celestial Armies Prince, [...] And thou in Military prowess next [...] Gabriel, lead forth to Battel these my Sons [...] Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints [...] By Thousands and by Millions rang'd for fight; [...] Equal in number to that Godless crew [...] Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms [...] 50 [...] Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heav'n [...] Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss, [...] Into thir place of punishment, the Gulf [...] Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide [...] His fiery Chaos to receave thir fall. [...] So spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began [...] To darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl [...] In duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe [...] Of wrauth awak't: nor with less dread the loud [...] Ethereal Trumpet from on high gan blow: [...] 60 [...] At which command the Powers Militant, [...] That stood for Heav'n, in mighty Quadrate joyn'd [...] Of Union irresistible, mov'd on [...] In silence thir bright Legions, to the sound [...] Of instrumental Harmonie that breath'd [...] Heroic Ardor to advent'rous deeds [...] Under thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause [...] Of God and his Messiah. On they move [...] Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill, [...] Nor streit'ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides [...] 70 [...] Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground [...] Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore [...] Thir nimble tread; as when the total kind [...] Of Birds in orderly array on wing [...] Came summond over Eden to receive [...] Thir names of thee; so over many a tract [...] Of Heav'n they march'd, and many a Province wide [...] Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last [...] Farr in th' Horizon to the North appeer'd [...] From skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht [...] 80 [...] In battailous aspect, and neerer view [...] Bristl'd with upright beams innumerable [...] Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throng'd, and Shields [...] Various, with boastful Argument portraid, [...] The banded Powers of Satan hasting on [...] With furious expedition; for they weend [...] That self same day by fight, or by surprize [...] To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne [...] To set the envier of his State, the proud [...] Aspirer, but thir thoughts prov'd fond and vain [...] 90 [...] In the mid way: though strange to us it seemd [...] At first, that Angel should with Angel warr, [...] And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet [...] So oft in Festivals of joy and love [...] Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire [...] Hymning th' Eternal Father: but the shout [...] Of Battel now began, and rushing sound [...] Of onset ended soon each milder thought. [...] High in the midst exalted as a God [...] Th' Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate [...] 100 [...] Idol of Majestie Divine, enclos'd [...] With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields; [...] Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now [...] 'Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left, [...] A dreadful interval, and Front to Front [...] Presented stood in terrible array [...] Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van, [...] On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn'd, [...] Satan with vast and haughtie strides advanc't, [...] Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold; [...] 110 [...] Abdiel that sight endur'd not, where he stood [...] Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds, [...] And thus his own undaunted heart explores. [...] O Heav'n! that such resemblance of the Highest [...] Should yet remain, where faith and realtie [...] Remain not; wherfore should not strength & might [...] There fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove [...] Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable? [...] His puissance, trusting in th' Almightie's aide, [...] I mean to try, whose Reason I have tri'd [...] 120 [...] Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just, [...] That he who in debate of Truth hath won, [...] Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike [...] Victor; though brutish that contest and foule, [...] When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so [...] Most reason is that Reason overcome. [...] So pondering, and from his armed Peers [...] Forth stepping opposite, half way he met [...] His daring foe, at this prevention more [...] Incens't, and thus securely him defi'd. [...] 130 [...] Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht [...] The highth of thy aspiring unoppos'd, [...] The Throne of God unguarded, and his side [...] Abandond at the terror of thy Power [...] Or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain [...] Against th' Omnipotent to rise in Arms; [...] Who out of smallest things could without end [...] Have rais'd incessant Armies to defeat [...] Thy folly; or with solitarie hand [...] Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow [...] 140 [...] Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd [...] Thy Legions under darkness; but thou seest [...] All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith [...] Prefer, and Pietie to God, though then [...] To thee not visible, when I alone [...] Seemd in thy World erroneous to dissent [...] From all: my Sect thou seest, now learn too late [...] How few somtimes may know, when thousands err. [...] Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance [...] Thus answerd. Ill for thee, but in wisht houre [...] 150 [...] Of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst [...] From flight, seditious Angel, to receave [...] Thy merited reward, the first assay [...] Of this right hand provok't, since first that tongue [...] Inspir'd with contradiction durst oppose [...] A third part of the Gods, in Synod met [...] Thir Deities to assert, who while they feel [...] Vigour Divine within them, can allow [...] Omnipotence to none. But well thou comst [...] Before thy fellows, ambitious to win [...] 160 [...] From me som Plume, that thy success may show [...] Destruction to the rest: this pause between [...] (Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know; [...] At first I thought that Libertie and Heav'n [...] To heav'nly Soules had bin all one; but now [...] I see that most through sloth had rather serve, [...] Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song; [...] Such hast thou arm'd, the Minstrelsie of Heav'n, [...] Servilitie with freedom to contend, [...] As both thir deeds compar'd this day shall prove. [...] 170 [...] To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern repli'd. [...] Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find [...] Of erring, from the path of truth remote: [...] Unjustly thou deprav'st it with the name [...] Of Servitude to serve whom God ordains, [...] Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same, [...] When he who rules is worthiest, and excells [...] Them whom he governs. This is servitude, [...] To serve th' unwise, or him who hath rebelld [...] Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee, [...] 180 [...] Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall'd; [...] Yet leudly dar'st our ministring upbraid. [...] Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve [...] In Heav'n God ever blessed, and his Divine [...] Behests obey, worthiest to be obey'd, [...] Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while [...] From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight, [...] This greeting on thy impious Crest receive. [...] So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high, [...] Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell [...] 190 [...] On the proud Crest of Satan, that no sight, [...] Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield [...] Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge [...] He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee [...] His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth [...] Winds under ground or waters forcing way [...] Sidelong, had push't a Mountain from his seat [...] Half sunk with all his Pines. Amazement seis'd [...] The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see [...] Thus foil'd thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout, [...] 200 [...] Presage of Victorie and fierce desire [...] Of Battel: whereat Michael bid sound [...] Th' Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heav'n [...] It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung [...] Hosanna to the Highest: nor stood at gaze [...] The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn'd [...] The horrid shock: now storming furie rose, [...] And clamour such as heard in Heav'n till now [...] Was never, Arms on Armour clashing bray'd [...] Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles [...] 210 [...] Of brazen Chariots rag'd; dire was the noise [...] Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss [...] Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew, [...] And flying vaulted either Host with fire. [...] Sounder fierie Cope together rush'd [...] Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault [...] And inextinguishable rage; all Heav'n [...] Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth [...] Had to her Center shook. What wonder? when [...] Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought [...] 220 [...] On either side, the least of whom could weild [...] These Elements, and arm him with the force [...] Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power [...] Armie against Armie numberless to raise [...] Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb, [...] Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat; [...] Had not th' Eternal King Omnipotent [...] From his strong hold of Heav'n high over-rul'd [...] And limited thir might; though numberd such [...] As each divided Legion might have seemd [...] 230 [...] A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand [...] A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd [...] Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert [...] When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway [...] Of Battel, open when, and when to close [...] The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight, [...] None of retreat, no unbecoming deed [...] That argu'd fear; each on himself reli'd, [...] As onely in his arm the moment lay [...] Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame [...] 240 [...] Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred [...] That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground [...] A standing fight, then soaring on main wing [...] Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then [...] Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale [...] The Battel hung; till Satan, who that day [...] Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes [...] No equal, raunging through the dire attack [...] Of fighting Seraphim confus'd, at length [...] Saw where the Sword of Michael smote, and fell'd [...] 250 [...] Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway [...] Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down [...] Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand [...] He hasted, and oppos'd the rockie Orb [...] Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield [...] A vast circumference: At his approach [...] The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile [...] Surceas'd, and glad as hoping here to end [...] Intestine War in Heav'n, the arch foe subdu'd [...] Or Captive drag'd in Chains, with hostile frown [...] 260 [...] And visage all enflam'd first thus began. [...] Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt, [...] Unnam'd in Heav'n, now plenteous, as thou seest [...] These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all, [...] Though heaviest by just measure on thy self [...] And thy adherents: how hast thou disturb'd [...] Heav'ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought [...] Miserie, uncreated till the crime [...] Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill'd [...] Thy malice into thousands, once upright [...] 270 [...] And faithful, now prov'd false. But think not here [...] To trouble Holy Rest; Heav'n casts thee out [...] From all her Confines. Heav'n the seat of bliss [...] Brooks not the works of violence and Warr. [...] Hence then, and evil go with thee along [...] Thy ofspring, {{to the place of}} evil, Hell, [...] Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles, [...] Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome, [...] Or som more sudden vengeance wing'd from God [...] Precipitate thee with augmented paine. [...] 280 [...] So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus [...] The Adversarie. Nor think thou with wind [...] Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds [...] Thou canst not. Hast thou turnd the least of these [...] To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise [...] Unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee [...] That thou shouldst hope, imperious, & with threats [...] To chase me hence? erre not that so shall end [...] The strife which thou call'st evil, but wee style [...] The strife of Glorie: which we mean to win, [...] 290 [...] Or turn this Heav'n it self into the Hell [...] Thou fablest, here however to dwell free, [...] If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force, [...] And join him nam'd Almightie to thy aid, [...] I flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh. [...] They ended parle, and both addrest for fight [...] Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue [...] Of Angels, can relate, or to what things [...] Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift [...] Human imagination to such highth [...] 300 [...] Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd, [...] Stood they or mov'd, in stature, motion, arms [...] Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav'n. [...] Now wav'd thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire [...] Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields [...] Blaz'd opposite, while expectation stood [...] In horror; from each hand with speed retir'd [...] Where erst was thickest fight, th' Angelic throng, [...] And left large field, unsafe within the wind [...] Of such commotion, such as to set forth [...] 310 [...] Great things by small, If Natures concord broke, [...] Among the Constellations warr were sprung, [...] Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne [...] Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie, [...] Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound.

[...] Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run [...] By Angels many and strong, who interpos'd [...] Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields [...] Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir'd [...] From off the files of warr; there they him laid [...] Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame [...] 340 [...] To find himself not matchless, and his pride [...] Humbl'd by such rebuke, so farr beneath [...] His confidence to equal God in power.

[...] Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd [...] Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought, [...] And with fierce Ensignes pierc'd the deep array [...] Of Moloc furious King, who him defi'd, [...] And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound [...] Threatn'd, nor from the Holie One of Heav'n [...] Refrein'd his tongue blasphemous; but anon [...] 360 [...] Down clov'n to the waste, with shatterd Armes [...] And uncouth paine fled bellowing. On each wing [...] Uriel and Raphael his vaunting foe, [...] Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd, [...] Vanquish'd Adramelec, and Asmadai, [...] Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods [...] Disdain'd, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight, [...] Mangl'd with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile. [...] Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy [...] The Atheist crew, but with redoubl'd blow [...] 370 [...] Ariel and Arioc, and the violence [...] Of Ramiel scorcht and blasted overthrew. [...] I might relate of thousands, and thir names [...] Eternize here on Earth; but those elect [...] Angels contented with thir fame in Heav'n [...] Seek not the praise of men: the other sort [...] In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr, [...] Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome [...] Canceld from Heav'n and sacred memorie, [...] Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell. [...] 380 [...] For strength from Truth divided and from Just, [...] Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise [...] And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires [...] Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame: [...] Therfore Eternal silence be thir doome. [...] And now thir mightiest quelld, the battel swerv'd, [...] With many an inrode gor'd; deformed rout [...] Enter'd, and foul disorder; all the ground [...] With shiverd armour strow'n, and on a heap [...] Chariot and Charioter lay overturnd [...] 390 [...] And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld [...] Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host [...] Defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris'd, [...] Then first with fear surpris'd and sense of paine [...] Fled ignominious, to such evil brought [...] By sinne of disobedience, till that hour [...] Not liable to fear or flight or paine. [...] Far otherwise th' inviolable Saints [...] In Cubic Phalanx firm advanc't entire, [...] Invulnerable, impenitrably arm'd: [...] 400 [...] Such high advantages thir innocence [...] Gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd, [...] Not to have disobei'd; in fight they stood [...] Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain'd [...] By wound, though from thir place by violence mov'd. [...] Now Night her course began, and over Heav'n [...] Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos'd, [...] And silence on the odious dinn of Warr: [...] Under her Cloudie covert both retir'd, [...] Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field [...] 410 [...] Michael and his Angels prevalent [...] Encamping, plac'd in Guard thir Watches round, [...] Cherubic waving fires: on th' other part [...] Satan with his rebellious disappeerd, [...] Far in the dark dislodg'd, and void of rest, [...] His Potentates to Councel call'd by night; [...] And in the midst thus undismai'd began. [...] O now in danger tri'd, now known in Armes [...] Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare, [...] Found worthy not of Libertie alone, [...] 420 [...] Too mean pretense, but what we more affect, [...] Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne, [...] Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight, [...] (And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?) [...] What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send [...] Against us from about his Throne, and judg'd [...] Sufficient to subdue us to his will, [...] But proves not so: then fallible, it seems, [...] Of future we may deem him, though till now [...] Omniscient thought. True is, less firmly arm'd, [...] 430 [...] Some disadvantage we endur'd and paine, [...] Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd, [...] Since now we find this our Empyreal forme [...] Incapable of mortal injurie [...] Imperishable, and though peirc'd with wound, [...] Soon closing, and by native vigour heal'd. [...] Of evil then so small as easie think [...] The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes, [...] Weapons more violent, when next we meet, [...] May serve to better us, and worse our foes, [...] 440 [...] Or equal what between us made the odds, [...] In Nature none: if other hidden cause [...] Left them Superiour, while we can preserve [...] Unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound, [...] Due search and consultation will disclose. [...] He sat; and in th' assembly next upstood [...] Nisroc, of Principalities the prime; [...] As one he stood escap't from cruel fight, [...] Sore toild, his riv'n Armes to havoc hewn, [...] And cloudie in aspect thus answering spake. [...] 450 [...] Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free [...] Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard [...] For Gods, and too unequal work we find [...] Against unequal armes to fight in paine, [...] Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil [...] Ruin must needs ensue; for what availes [...] Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain [...] Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands [...] Of Mightiest. Sense of pleasure we may well [...] Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine, [...] 460 [...] But live content, which is the calmest life: [...] But pain is perfet miserie, the worst [...] Of evils, and excessive, overturnes [...] All patience. He who therefore can invent [...] With what more forcible we may offend [...] Our yet unwounded Enemies, or arme [...] Our selves with like defence, to mee deserves [...] No less then for deliverance what we owe. [...] Whereto with look compos'd Satan repli'd. [...] Not uninvented that, which thou aright [...] 470 [...] Beleivst so main to our success, I bring; [...] Which of us who beholds the bright surface [...] Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand, [...] This continent of spacious Heav'n, adornd [...] With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms & Gold, [...] Whose Eye so superficially surveyes [...] These things, as not to mind from whence they grow [...] Deep under ground, materials dark and crude, [...] Of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht [...] With Heav'ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth [...] 480 [...] So beauteous, op'ning to the ambient light. [...] These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep [...] Shall yeild us, pregnant with infernal flame, [...] Which into hallow <b>Engins</b> long and round [...] Thick-rammd, at th' other bore with touch of fire [...] Dilated and infuriate shall send forth [...] From far with thundring noise among our foes [...] Such implements of mischief as shall dash [...] To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands [...] Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd [...] 490 [...] The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt. [...] Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne, [...] Effect shall end our wish. Mean while revive; [...] Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind [...] Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird. [...] He ended, and his words thir drooping chere [...] Enlightn'd, and thir languisht hope reviv'd. [...] Th' invention all admir'd, and each, how hee [...] To be th' inventer miss'd, so easie it seemd [...] Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought [...] 500 [...] Impossible: yet haply of thy Race [...] In future dayes, if Malice should abound, [...] Some one intent on mischief, or inspir'd [...] With dev'lish machination might devise [...] Like instrument to plague the Sons of men [...] For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent. [...] Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew, [...] None arguing stood, innumerable hands [...] Were ready, in a moment up they turnd [...] Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath [...] 510 [...] Th' originals of Nature in thir crude [...] Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame [...] They found, they mingl'd, and with suttle Art, [...] Concocted and adusted they reduc'd [...] To blackest grain, and into store conveyd: [...] Part hidd'n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth [...] Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone, [...] Whereof to found thir <b>Engins</b> and thir Balls [...] Of missive ruin; part incentive reed [...] Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire. [...] 520 [...] So all ere day spring, under conscious Night [...] Secret they finish'd, and in order set, [...] With silent circumspection unespi'd. [...] Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav'n appeerd [...] Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms [...] The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood [...] Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host, [...] Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills [...] Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure, [...] Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe, [...] 530 [...] Where lodg'd, or whither fled, or if for fight, [...] In motion or in alt: him soon they met [...] Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow [...] But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail [...] Zephiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing, [...] Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri'd. [...] Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand, [...] Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit [...] This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud [...] He comes, and settl'd in his face I see [...] 540 [...] Sad resolution and secure: let each [...] His Adamantine coat gird well, and each [...] Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield, [...] Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down, [...] If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr, [...] But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire. [...] So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon [...] In order, quit of all impediment; [...] Instant without disturb they took Allarm, [...] And onward move Embattelld; when behold [...] 550 [...] Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe [...] Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube [...] Training his devilish Enginrie, impal'd [...] On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep, [...] To hide the fraud. At interview both stood [...] A while, but suddenly at head appeerd [...] Satan: And thus was heard Commanding loud. [...] Vangard, to Right and Left the Front unfould; [...] That all may see who hate us, how we seek [...] Peace and composure, and with open brest [...] 560 [...] Stand readie to receive them, if they like [...] Our overture, and turn not back perverse; [...] But that I doubt, however witness Heaven, [...] Heav'n witness thou anon, while we discharge [...] Freely our part: yee who appointed stand [...] Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch [...] What we propound, and loud that all may hear. [...] So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce [...] Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front [...] Divided, and to either Flank retir'd. [...] 570 [...] Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange, [...] A triple-mounted row of Pillars laid [...] On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem'd [...] Or hollow'd bodies made of Oak or Firr [...] With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell'd) [...] Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes [...] With hideous orifice gap't on us wide, [...] Portending hollow truce; at each behind [...] A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed [...] Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense, [...] 580 [...] Collected stood within our thoughts amus'd, [...] Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds [...] Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli'd [...] With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame, [...] But soon obscur'd with smoak, all Heav'n appeerd, [...] From those deep-throated <b>Engins</b> belcht, whose roar [...] Emboweld with outragious noise the Air, [...] And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule [...] Thir devillish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail [...] Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host [...] 590 [...] Level'd, with such impetuous furie smote, [...] That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand, [...] Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell [...] By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl'd; [...] The sooner for thir Arms, unarm'd they might [...] Have easily as Spirits evaded swift [...] By quick contraction or remove; but now [...] Foule dissipation follow'd and forc't rout; [...] Nor serv'd it to relax thir serried files. [...] What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse [...] 600 [...] Repeated, and indecent overthrow [...] Doubl'd, would render them yet more despis'd, [...] And to thir foes a laughter; for in view [...] Stood rankt of Seraphim another row [...] In posture to displode thir second tire [...] Of Thunder: back defeated to return [...] They worse abhorr'd. Satan beheld thir plight, [...] And to his Mates thus in derision call'd. [...] O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud? [...] Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee, [...] 610 [...] To entertain them fair with open Front [...] And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms [...] Of composition, strait they chang'd thir minds, [...] Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell, [...] As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd [...] Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps [...] For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose [...] If our proposals once again were heard [...] We should compel them to a quick result. [...] To whom thus Belial in like gamesom mood. [...] 620 [...] Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight, [...] Of hard contents, and full of force urg'd home, [...] Such as we might perceive amus'd them all, [...] And stumbl'd many, who receives them right, [...] Had need from head to foot well understand; [...] Not understood, this gift they have besides, [...] They shew us when our foes walk not upright. [...] So they among themselves in pleasant veine [...] Stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond [...] All doubt of Victorie, eternal might [...] 630 [...] To match with thir inventions they presum'd [...] So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn, [...] And all his Host derided, while they stood [...] A while in trouble; but they stood not long, [...] Rage prompted them at length, & found them arms [...] Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. [...] Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power [...] Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac'd) [...] Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills [...] (For Earth hath this variety from Heav'n [...] 640 [...] Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale) [...] Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew, [...] From thir foundations loosning to and fro [...] They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load, [...] Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops [...] Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze, [...] Be sure, and terrour seis'd the rebel Host, [...] When coming towards them so dread they saw [...] The bottom of the Mountains upward turn'd, [...] Till on those cursed <b>Engins</b> triple-row [...] 650 [...] They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence [...] Under the weight of Mountains buried deep, [...] Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads [...] Main Promontories flung, which in the Air [...] Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm'd, [...] Thir armor help'd thir harm, crush't in and brus'd [...] Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain [...] Implacable, and many a dolorous groan, [...] Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind [...] Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, [...] 660 [...] Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. [...] The rest in imitation to like Armes [...] Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore; [...] So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills [...] Hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire, [...] That under ground they fought in dismal shade; [...] Infernal noise; Warr seem'd a civil Game [...] To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt [...] Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav'n [...] Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred, [...] 670 [...] Had not th' Almightie Father where he sits [...] Shrin'd in his Sanctuarie of Heav'n secure, [...] Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen [...] This tumult, and permitted all, advis'd: [...] That his great purpose he might so fulfill, [...] To honour his Anointed Son aveng'd [...] Upon his enemies, and to declare [...] All power on him transferr'd: whence to his Son [...] Th' Assessor of his Throne he thus began. [...] Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov'd, [...] 680 [...] Son in whose face invisible is beheld [...] Visibly, what by Deitie I am, [...] And in whose hand what by Decree I doe, [...] Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past, [...] Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav'n, [...] Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame [...] These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight, [...] As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm'd; [...] For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst, [...] Equal in their Creation they were form'd, [...] 690 [...] Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought [...] Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom; [...] Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last [...] Endless, and no solution will be found: [...] Warr wearied hath perform'd what Warr can do, [...] And to disorder'd rage let loose the reines, [...] With Mountains as with Weapons arm'd, which makes [...] Wild work in Heav'n, and dangerous to the maine. [...] Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine; [...] For thee I have ordain'd it, and thus farr [...] 700 [...] Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine [...] Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou [...] Can end it. Into thee such Vertue and Grace [...] Immense I have transfus'd, that all may know [...] In Heav'n and Hell thy Power above compare, [...] And this perverse Commotion governd thus, [...] To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir [...] Of all things, to be Heir and to be King [...] By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right. [...] Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might, [...] 710 [...] Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles [...] That shake Heav'ns basis, bring forth all my Warr, [...] My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms [...] Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh; [...] Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out [...] From all Heav'ns bounds into the utter Deep: [...] There let them learn, as likes them, to despise [...] God and Messiah his anointed King. [...] He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct [...] Shon full, he all his Father full exprest [...] 720 [...] Ineffably into his face receiv'd, [...] And thus the filial Godhead answering spake. [...] O Father, O Supream of heav'nly Thrones, [...] First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst [...] To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee, [...] As is most just; this I my Glorie account, [...] My exaltation, and my whole delight, [...] That thou in me well pleas'd, declarst thy will [...] Fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss. [...] Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume, [...] 730 [...] And gladlier shall resign, when in the end [...] Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee [...] For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov'st: [...] But whom thou hat'st, I hate, and can put on [...] Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on, [...] Image of thee in all things; and shall soon, [...] Armd with thy might, rid heav'n of these rebell'd, [...] To thir prepar'd ill Mansion driven down [...] To chains of Darkness, and th' undying Worm, [...] That from thy just obedience could revolt, [...] 740 [...] Whom to obey is happiness entire. [...] Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th' impure [...] Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount [...] Unfained Halleluiahs to thee sing, [...] Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief. [...] So said, he o're his Scepter bowing, rose [...] From the right hand of Glorie where he sate, [...] And the third sacred Morn began to shine [...] Dawning through Heav'n: forth rush'd with whirlwind sound [...] The Chariot of Paternal Deitie, [...] 750 [...] Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn, [...] It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd [...] By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each [...] Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all [...] And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the Wheels [...] Of Beril, and careering Fires between; [...] Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament, [...] Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure [...] Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch. [...] Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd [...] 760 [...] Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, [...] Ascended, at his right hand Victorie [...] Sate Eagle-wing'd, beside him hung his Bow [...] And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor'd, [...] And from about him fierce Effusion rowld [...] Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire; [...] Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, [...] He onward came, farr off his coming shon, [...] And twentie thousand (I thir number heard) [...] Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen: [...] 770 [...] Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime [...] On the Crystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron'd. [...] Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own [...] First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz'd, [...] When the great Ensign of Messiah blaz'd [...] Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav'n: [...] Under whose Conduct Michael soon reduc'd [...] His Armie, circumfus'd on either Wing, [...] Under thir Head imbodied all in one. [...] Before him Power Divine his way prepar'd; [...] 780 [...] At his command the uprooted Hills retir'd [...] Each to his place, they heard his voice and went [...] Obsequious, Heav'n his wonted face renewd, [...] And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil'd. [...] This saw his hapless Foes, but stood obdur'd, [...] And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers [...] Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. [...] In heav'nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? [...] But to convince the proud what Signs availe, [...] Or Wonders move th' obdurate to relent? [...] 790 [...] They hard'nd more by what might most reclame, [...] Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight [...] Took envie, and aspiring to his highth, [...] Stood reimbattell'd fierce, by force or fraud [...] Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile [...] Against God and Messiah, or to fall [...] In universal ruin last, and now [...] To final Battel drew, disdaining flight, [...] Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God [...] To all his Host on either hand thus spake. [...] 800 [...] Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand [...] Ye Angels arm'd, this day from Battel rest; [...] Faithful hath been your Warfare, and of God [...] Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause, [...] And as ye have receivd, so have ye don [...] Invincibly; but of this cursed crew [...] The punishment to other hand belongs, [...] Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints; [...] Number to this dayes work is not ordain'd [...] Nor multitude, stand onely and behold [...] 810 [...] Gods indignation on these Godless pourd [...] By mee; not you but mee they have despis'd, [...] Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage, [...] Because the Father, t' whom in Heav'n supream [...] Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains, [...] Hath honourd me according to his will. [...] Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig'n'd; [...] That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee [...] In Battel which the stronger proves, they all, [...] Or I alone against them, since by strength [...] 820 [...] They measure all, of other excellence [...] Not emulous, nor care who them excells; [...] Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe. [...] So spake the Son, and into terrour chang'd [...] His count'nance too severe to be beheld [...] And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies. [...] At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings [...] With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes [...] Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound [...] Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host. [...] 830 [...] Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove, [...] Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles [...] The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout, [...] All but the Throne it self of God. Full soon [...] Among them he arriv'd; in his right hand [...] Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent [...] Before him, such as in thir Soules infix'd [...] Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost, [...] All courage; down thir idle weapons drop'd; [...] O're Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode [...] 840 [...] Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, [...] That wish'd the Mountains now might be again [...] Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire. [...] Nor less on either side tempestuous fell [...] His arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd Foure, [...] Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels, [...] Distinct alike with multitude of eyes, [...] One Spirit in them rul'd, and every eye [...] Glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire [...] Among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength, [...] 850 [...] And of thir wonted vigour left them draind, [...] Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n. [...] Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd [...] His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant [...] Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav'n: [...] The overthrown he rais'd, and as a Heard [...] Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd [...] Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu'd [...] With terrors and with furies to the bounds [...] And Chrystall wall of Heav'n, which op'ning wide, [...] 860 [...] Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos'd [...] Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight [...] Strook them with horror backward, but far worse [...] Urg'd them behind; headlong themselvs they threw [...] Down from the verge of Heav'n, Eternal wrauth [...] Burnt after them to the bottomless pit. [...] Hell heard th' unsufferable noise, Hell saw [...] Heav'n ruining from Heav'n and would have fled [...] Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep [...] Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. [...] 870 [...] Nine dayes they fell; confounded Chaos roard, [...] And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall [...] Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout [...] Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last [...] Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos'd, [...] Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire [...] Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine. [...] Disburd'nd Heav'n rejoic'd, and soon repaird [...] Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld. [...] Sole Victor from th' expulsion of his Foes [...] 880 [...] Messiah his triumphal Chariot turnd: [...] To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood [...] Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts, [...] With Jubilie advanc'd; and as they went, [...] Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright, [...] Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King, [...] Son, Heire, and Lord, to him Dominion giv'n, [...] Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode [...] Triumphant through mid Heav'n, into the Courts [...] And Temple of his mightie Father Thron'd [...] 890 [...] On high; who into Glorie him receav'd, [...] Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss. [...] Thus measuring things in Heav'n by things on Earth [...] At thy request, and that thou maist beware [...] By what is past, to thee I have reveal'd [...] What might have else to human Race bin hid; [...] The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav'n [...] Among th' Angelic Powers, and the deep fall [...] Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld [...] With Satan, hee who envies now thy state, [...] 900 [...] Who now is plotting how he may seduce [...] Thee also from obedience, that with him [...] Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake [...] His punishment, Eternal miserie; [...] Which would be all his solace and revenge, [...] As a despite don against the most High, [...] Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe.

[...] Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night [...] 50 [...] To mortal men, he with his horrid crew [...] Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe [...] Confounded though immortal: But his doom [...] Reserv'd him to more wrath; for now the thought [...] Both of lost happiness and lasting pain [...] Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes [...] That witness'd huge affliction and dismay [...] Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate: [...] At once as far as Angels kenn he views [...] The dismal Situation waste and wilde, [...] 60 [...] A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round [...] As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames [...] No light, but rather darkness visible [...] Serv'd only to discover sights of woe, [...] Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace [...] And rest can never dwell, hope never comes [...] That comes to all; but torture without end [...] Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed [...] With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum'd: [...] Such place Eternal Justice had prepar'd [...] 70 [...] For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain'd [...] In utter darkness, and their portion set [...] As far remov'd from God and light of Heav'n [...] As from the Center thrice to th' utmost Pole. [...] O how unlike the place from whence they fell! [...] There the companions of his fall, o'rewhelm'd [...] With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire, [...] He soon discerns, and weltring by his side [...] One next himself in power, and next in crime, [...] Long after known in Palestine, and nam'd [...] 80 [...] Beelzebub. To whom th' Arch-Enemy, [...] And thence in Heav'n call'd Satan, with bold words [...] Breaking the horrid silence thus began. [...] If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'd [...] From him, who in the happy Realms of Light [...] Cloth'd with transcendent brightnes didst outshine [...] Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league, [...] United thoughts and counsels, equal hope, [...] And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize, [...] Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd [...] 90 [...] In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest [...] From what highth fal'n, so much the stronger provd [...] He with his Thunder: and till then who knew [...] The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those [...] Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage [...] Can else inflict do I repent or change, [...] Though chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt mind [...] And high disdain, from sence of injur'd merit, [...] That with the mightiest rais'd me to contend, [...] And to the fierce contention brought along [...] 100 [...] Innumerable force of Spirits arm'd [...] That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring, [...] His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd [...] In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n, [...] And shook his throne. What though the field be lost? [...] All is not lost; the unconquerable Will, [...] And study of revenge, immortal hate, [...] And courage never to submit or yield: [...] And what is else not to be overcome? [...] That Glory never shall his wrath or might [...] 110 [...] Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace [...] With suppliant knee, and deifie his power [...] Who from the terrour of this Arm so late [...] Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed, [...] That were an ignominy and shame beneath [...] This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods [...] And this Empyreal substance cannot fail, [...] Since through experience of this great event [...] In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't, [...] We may with more successful hope resolve [...] 120 [...] To wage by force or guile eternal Warr [...] Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe, [...] Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy [...] Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n. [...] So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain, [...] Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare: [...] And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer. [...] O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers, [...] That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr [...] Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds [...] 130 [...] Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King; [...] And put to proof his high Supremacy, [...] Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate, [...] Too well I see and rue the dire event, [...] That with sad overthrow and foul defeat [...] Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host [...] In horrible destruction laid thus low, [...] As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences [...] Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains [...] Invincible, and vigour soon returns, [...] 140 [...] Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state [...] Here swallow'd up in endless misery. [...] But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now [...] Of force believe Almighty, since no less [...] Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours) [...] Have left us this our spirit and strength intire [...] Strongly to suffer and support our pains, [...] That we may so suffice his vengeful ire, [...] Or do him mightier service as his thralls [...] By right of Warr, what e're his business be [...] 150 [...] Here {{in the heart of}} Hell to work in Fire, [...] Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep; [...] What can it then avail though yet we feel [...] Strength undiminisht, or eternal being [...] To undergo eternal punishment? [...] Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd. [...] Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable [...] Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure, [...] To do ought good never will be our task, [...] But ever to do ill our sole delight, [...] 160 [...] As being the contrary to his high will [...] Whom we resist. If then his Providence [...] Out of our evil seek to bring forth good, [...] Our labour must be to pervert that end, [...] And out of good still to find means of evil; [...] Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps [...] Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb [...] His inmost counsels from their destind aim. [...] But see the angry Victor hath recall'd [...] His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit [...] 170 [...] Back to the Gates of Heav'n: The Sulphurous Hail [...] Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid [...] The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice [...] Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder, [...] Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage, [...] Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now [...] To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep. [...] Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn, [...] Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe. [...] Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde, [...] 180 [...] The seat of desolation, voyd of light, [...] Save what the glimmering of these livid flames [...] Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend [...] From off the tossing of these fiery waves, [...] There rest, if any rest can harbour there, [...] And reassembling our afflicted Powers, [...] Consult how we may henceforth most offend [...] Our Enemy, our own loss how repair, [...] How overcome this dire Calamity, [...] What reinforcement we may gain from Hope, [...] 190 [...] If not what resolution from despare. [...] Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate [...] With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes [...] That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides [...] Prone on the Flood, extended long and large [...] Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge [...] As whom the Fables name of monstrous size, [...] Titanian, or Earth-born, that warr'd on Jove, [...] Briarios or Typhon, whom the Den [...] By ancient Tarsus held, or that Sea-beast [...] 200 [...] Leviathan, which God of all his works [...] Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream: [...] Him haply slumbring on the Norway foam [...] The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff, [...] Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell, [...] With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind [...] Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night [...] Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes: [...] So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay [...] Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence [...] 210 [...] Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will [...] And high permission of all-ruling Heaven [...] Left him at large to his own dark designs, [...] That with reiterated crimes he might [...] Heap on himself damnation, while he sought [...] Evil to others, and enrag'd might see [...] How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth [...] Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn [...] On Man by him seduc't, but on himself [...] Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd. [...] 220 [...] Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool [...] His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames [...] Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, & rowld [...] In billows, leave i'th' midst a horrid Vale. [...] Then with expanded wings he stears his flight [...] Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air [...] That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land [...] He lights, if it were Land that ever burn'd [...] With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire; [...] And such appear'd in hue, as when the force [...] 230 [...] Of subterranean wind transports a Hill [...] Torn from Pelorus, or the shatter'd side [...] Of thundring Aetna, whose combustible [...] And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire, [...] Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds, [...] And leave a singed bottom all involv'd [...] With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole [...] Of unblest feet. Him followed his next Mate, [...] Both glorying to have scap't the Stygian flood [...] As Gods, and by their own recover'd strength, [...] 240 [...] Not by the sufferance of supernal Power. [...] Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime, [...] Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat [...] That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom [...] For that celestial light? Be it so, since hee [...] Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid [...] What shall be right: fardest from him is best [...] Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream [...] Above his equals. Farewel happy Fields [...] Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail [...] 250 [...] Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell [...] Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings [...] A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time. [...] The mind is its own place, and in it self [...] Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n. [...] What matter where, if I be still the same, [...] And what I should be, all but less then hee [...] Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least [...] We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built [...] Here for his envy, will not drive us hence: [...] 260 [...] Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce [...] To reign is worth ambition though in Hell: [...] Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n. [...] But wherefore let we then our faithful friends, [...] Th' associates and copartners of our loss [...] Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool, [...] And call them not to share with us their part [...] In this unhappy Mansion, or once more [...] With rallied Arms to try what may be yet [...] Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell? [...] 270 [...] So Satan spake, and him Beelzebub [...] Thus answer'd. Leader of those Armies bright, [...] Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld, [...] If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge [...] Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft [...] In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge [...] Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults [...] Their surest signal, they will soon resume [...] New courage and revive, though now they lye [...] Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire, [...] 280 [...] As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd, [...] No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth. [...] He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend [...] Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield [...] Ethereal temper, massy, large and round, [...] Behind him cast; the broad circumference [...] Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb [...] Through Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist views [...] At Ev'ning from the top of Fesole, [...] Or in Valdarno, to descry new Lands, [...] 290 [...] Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe. [...] His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine [...] Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the Mast [...] Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand, [...] He walkt with to support uneasie steps [...] Over the burning Marle, not like those steps [...] On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime [...] Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire; [...] Knotholes he so endur'd, till on the Beach [...] Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd [...] 300 [...] His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't [...] Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks [...] In Vallombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades [...] High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge [...] Afloat, when with fierce Winds Orion arm'd [...] Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew [...] Busiris and his Memphian Chivalrie, [...] While with perfidious hatred they pursu'd [...] The Sojourners of Goshen, who beheld [...] From the safe shore their floating Carkases [...] 310 [...] And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown [...] Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood, [...] Under amazement of their hideous change. [...] He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep [...] Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates, [...] Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost, [...] If such astonishment as this can sieze [...] Eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place [...] After the toyl of Battel to repose [...] Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find [...] 320 [...] To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n? [...] Or in this abject posture have ye sworn [...] To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds [...] Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood [...] With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon [...] His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern [...] Th' advantage, and descending tread us down [...] Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts [...] Transfix us {{to the bottom of this}} Gulfe. [...] Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n. [...] 330 [...] They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung [...] Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch [...] On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread, [...] Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake. [...] Nor did they not perceave the evil plight [...] In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel; [...] Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd [...] Innumerable. As when the potent Rod [...] Of Amrams Son in Egypts evill day [...] Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud [...] 340 [...] Of Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind, [...] That ore the Realm of impious Pharoah hung [...] Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of Nile: [...] So numberless were those bad Angels seen [...] Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell [...] 'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires; [...] Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear [...] Of their great Sultan waving to direct [...] Thir course, in even ballance down they light [...] On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain; [...] 350 [...] A multitude, like which the populous North [...] Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass [...] Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous Sons [...] Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread [...] Beneath Gibraltar to the Lybian sands. [...] Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band [...] The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood [...] Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms [...] Excelling human, Princely Dignities, [...] And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones; [...] 360 [...] Though of their Names in heav'nly Records now [...] Be no memorial, blotted out and ras'd [...] By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life. [...] Nor had they yet among the Sons of Eve [...] Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth, [...] Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man, [...] By falsities and lyes the greatest part [...] Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake [...] God their Creator, and th' invisible [...] Glory of him, that made them, to transform [...] 370 [...] Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd [...] With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold, [...] And Devils to adore for Deities: [...] Then were they known to men by various Names, [...] And various Idols through the Heathen World. [...] Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last, [...] Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch, [...] At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth [...] Came singly where he stood on the bare strand, [...] While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof? [...] 380 [...] The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell [...] Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix [...] Their Seats long after next the Seat of God, [...] Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd [...] Among the Nations round, and durst abide [...] Jehovah thundring out of Sion, thron'd [...] Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd [...] Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines, [...] Abominations; and with cursed things [...] His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd, [...] 390 [...] And with their darkness durst affront his light. [...] First Moloch, horrid King besmear'd with blood [...] Of human sacrifice, and parents tears, [...] Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud [...] Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire [...] To his grim Idol. Him the Ammonite [...] Worshipt in Rabba and her watry Plain, [...] In Argob and in Basan, to the stream [...] Of utmost Arnon. Nor content with such [...] Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart [...] 400 [...] Of Solomon he led by fraud to build [...] His Temple right against the Temple of God [...] On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove [...] The pleasant Vally of Hinnom, Tophet thence [...] And black Gehenna call'd, the Type of Hell. [...] Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moabs Sons, [...] From Aroer to Nebo, and the wild [...] Of Southmost Abarim; in Hesebon [...] And Heronaim, Seons Realm, beyond [...] The flowry Dale of Sibma clad with Vines, [...] 410 [...] And Eleale to th' Asphaltick Pool. [...] Peor his other Name, when he entic'd [...] Israel in Sittim on their march from Nile [...] To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe. [...] Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd [...] Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove [...] Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate; [...] Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell. [...] With these came they, who from the bordring flood [...] Of old Euphrates to the Brook that parts [...] 420 [...] Egypt from Syrian ground, had general Names [...] Of Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male, [...] These Feminine. For Spirits when they please [...] Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft [...] And uncompounded is their Essence pure, [...] Not ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb, [...] Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones, [...] Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose [...] Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure, [...] Can execute their aerie purposes, [...] 430 [...] And works of love or enmity fulfill. [...] For those the Race of Israel oft forsook [...] Their living strength, and unfrequented left [...] His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down [...] To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low [...] Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear [...] Of despicable foes. With these in troop [...] Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians call'd [...] Astarte, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns; [...] To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon [...] 440 [...] Sidonian Virgins paid their Vows and Songs, [...] In Sion also not unsung, where stood [...] Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built [...] By that uxorious King, whose heart though large, [...] Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell [...] To Idols foul. Thammuz came next behind, [...] Whose annual wound in Lebanon allur'd [...] The Syrian Damsels to lament his fate [...] In amorous dittyes all a Summers day, [...] While smooth Adonis from his native Rock [...] 450 [...] Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood [...] Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the Love-tale [...] Infected Sions daughters with like heat, [...] Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch [...] Ezekiel saw, when by the Vision led [...] His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries [...] Of alienated Judah. Next came one [...] Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark [...] Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off [...] In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge, [...] 460 [...] Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers: [...] Dagon his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man [...] And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high [...] Rear'd in Azotus, dreaded through the Coast [...] Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon, [...] And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds. [...] Him follow'd Rimmon, whose delightful Seat [...] Was fair Damascus, on the fertil Banks [...] Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams. [...] He also against the house of God was bold: [...] 470 [...] A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King, [...] Ahaz his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew [...] Gods Altar to disparage and displace [...] For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn [...] His odious offrings, and adore the Gods [...] Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear'd [...] A crew who under Names of old Renown, [...] Osiris, Isis, Orus and their Train [...] With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd [...] Fanatic Egypt and her Priests, to seek [...] 480 [...] Thir wandring Gods disguis'd in brutish forms [...] Rather then human. Nor did Israel scape [...] Th' infection when their borrow'd Gold compos'd [...] The Calf in Oreb: and the Rebel King [...] Doubl'd that sin in Bethel and in Dan, [...] Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox, [...] Jehovah, who in one Night when he pass'd [...] From Egypt marching, equal'd with one stroke [...] Both her first born and all her bleating Gods. [...] Belial came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd [...] 490 [...] Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love [...] Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood [...] Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee [...] In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest [...] Turns Atheist, as did Ely's Sons, who fill'd [...] With lust and violence the house of God. [...] In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns [...] And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse [...] Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs, [...] And injury and outrage: And when Night [...] 500 [...] Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons [...] Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine. [...] Witness the Streets of Sodom, and that night [...] In Gibeah, when hospitable Dores [...] Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape. [...] These were the prime in order and in might; [...] The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd, [...] Th' Ionian Gods, of Javans Issue held [...] Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth [...] Thir boasted Parents; Titan Heav'ns first born [...] 510 [...] With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd [...] By younger Saturn, he from mightier Jove [...] His own and Rhea's Son like measure found; [...] So Jove usurping reign'd: these first in Creet [...] And Ida known, thence on the Snowy top [...] Of cold Olympus rul'd the middle Air [...] Thir highest Heav'n; or on the Delphian Cliff, [...] Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds [...] Of Doric Land; or who with Saturn old [...] Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian Fields, [...] 520 [...] And ore the Celtic roam'd the utmost Isles. [...] All these and more came flocking; but with looks [...] Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd [...] Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief [...] Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost [...] In loss it self; which on his count'nance cast [...] Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride [...] Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore [...] Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais'd [...] Their fainted courage, and dispel'd their fears. [...] 530 [...] Then strait commands that at the warlike sound [...] Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard [...] His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd [...] Azazel as his right, a Cherube tall: [...] Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld [...] Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't [...] Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind [...] With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd, [...] Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while [...] Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds: [...] 540 [...] At which the universal Host upsent [...] A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond [...] Frighted the Reign of Chaos and old Night. [...] All in a moment through the gloom were seen [...] Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air [...] With Orient Colours waving: with them rose [...] A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms [...] Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array [...] Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move [...] In perfect Phalanx to the Dorian mood [...] 550 [...] Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd [...] To highth of noblest temper Hero's old [...] Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage [...] Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd [...] With dread of death to flight or foul retreat, [...] Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage [...] With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase [...] Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain [...] From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they [...] Breathing united force with fixed thought [...] 560 [...] Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd [...] Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now [...] Advanc't in view they stand, a horrid Front [...] Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise [...] Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield, [...] Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief [...] Had to impose: He through the armed Files [...] Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse [...] The whole Battalion views, thir order due, [...] Thir visages and stature as of Gods, [...] 570 [...] Thir number last he summs. And now his heart [...] Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength [...] Glories: For never since created man, [...] Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these [...] Could merit more then that small infantry [...] Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood [...] Of Phlegra with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd [...] That fought at Theb's and Ilium, on each side [...] Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds [...] In Fable or Romance of Uthers Son [...] 580 [...] Begirt with British and Armoric Knights; [...] And all who since, Baptiz'd or Infidel [...] Jousted in Aspramont or Montalban, [...] Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond, [...] Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore [...] When Charlemain with all his Peerage fell [...] By Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond [...] Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd [...] Thir dread Commander: he above the rest [...] In shape and gesture proudly eminent [...] 590 [...] Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost [...] All her Original brightness, nor appear'd [...] Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess [...] Of Glory obscur'd: As when the Sun new ris'n [...] Looks through the Horizontal misty Air [...] Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon [...] In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds [...] On half the Nations, and with fear of change [...] Perplexes Monarchs. Dark'n'd so, yet shon [...] Above them all th' Arch Angel: but his face [...] 600 [...] Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care [...] Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes [...] Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride [...] Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast [...] Signs of remorse and passion to behold [...] The fellows of his crime, the followers rather [...] (Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd [...] For ever now to have their lot in pain, [...] Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't [...] Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung [...] 610 [...] For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood, [...] Thir Glory witherd. As when Heavens Fire [...] Hath scath'd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines, [...] With singed top their stately growth though bare [...] Stands on the blasted Heath. He now prepar'd [...] To speak; whereat their doubl'd Ranks they bend [...] From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round [...] With all his Peers: attention held them mute. [...] Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn, [...] Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last [...] 620 [...] Words interwove with sighs found out their way. [...] O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers [...] Matchless, but with th' Almighty, and that strife [...] Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire, [...] As this place testifies, and this dire change [...] Hateful to utter: but what power of mind [...] Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth [...] Of knowledge past or present, could have fear'd, [...] How such united force of Gods, how such [...] As stood like these, could ever know repulse? [...] 630 [...] For who can yet beleeve, though after loss, [...] That all these puissant Legions, whose exile [...] Hath emptied Heav'n, shall faile to re-ascend [...] Self-rais'd, and repossess their native seat. [...] For me, be witness all the Host of Heav'n, [...] If counsels different, or danger shun'd [...] By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns [...] Monarch in Heav'n, till then as one secure [...] Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute, [...] Consent or custome, and his Regal State [...] 640 [...] Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd, [...] Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall. [...] Henceforth his might we know, and know our own [...] So as not either to provoke, or dread [...] New warr, provok't; our better part remains [...] To work in close design, by fraud or guile [...] What force effected not: that he no less [...] At length from us may find, who overcomes [...] By force, hath overcome but half his foe. [...] Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife [...] 650 [...] There went a fame in Heav'n that he ere long [...] Intended to create, and therein plant [...] A generation, whom his choice regard [...] Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven: [...] Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps [...] Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere: [...] For this Infernal Pit shall never hold [...] Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' Abysse [...] Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts [...] Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird, [...] 660 [...] For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr [...] Open or understood must be resolv'd. [...] He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew [...] Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs [...] Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze [...] Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd [...] Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm's [...] Clash'd on their sounding shields the din of war, [...] Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav'n. [...] There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top [...] 670 [...] Belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire [...] Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign [...] That in his womb was hid metallic Ore, [...] The work of Sulphur. Thither wing'd with speed [...] A numerous Brigad hasten'd. As when bands [...] Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm'd [...] Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field, [...] Or cast a Rampart. Mammon led them on, [...] Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell [...] From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks and thoughts [...] 680 [...] Were always downward bent, admiring more [...] The riches of Heav'ns pavement, trod'n Gold, [...] Then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd [...] In vision beatific: by him first [...] Men also, and by his suggestion taught, [...] Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands [...] Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth [...] For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew [...] Op'nd into the Hill a spacious wound [...] And dig'd out ribs of Gold. Let none admire [...] 690 [...] That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best [...] Deserve the pretious bane. And here let those [...] Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell [...] Of Babel, and the works of Memphian Kings, [...] Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame, [...] And Strength and Art are easily outdone [...] By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour [...] What in an age they with incessant toyle [...] And hands innumerable scarce perform [...] Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd, [...] 700 [...] That underneath had veins of liquid fire [...] Sluc'd from the Lake, a second multitude [...] With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore, [...] Severing each kinde, and scum'd the Bullion dross: [...] A third as soon had form'd within the ground [...] A various mould, and from the boyling cells [...] By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook, [...] As in an Organ from one blast of wind [...] To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths. [...] Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge [...] 710 [...] Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound [...] Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet, [...] Built like a Temple, where Pilasters round [...] Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid [...] With Golden Architrave; nor did there want [...] Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n, [...] The Roof was fretted Gold. Not Babilon, [...] Nor great Alcairo such magnificence [...] Equal'd in all thir glories, to inshrine [...] Belus or Serapis thir Gods, or seat [...] 720 [...] Thir Kings, when Aegypt with Assyria strove [...] In wealth and luxurie. Th' ascending pile [...] Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores [...] Op'ning thir brazen foulds discover wide [...] Within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth [...] And level pavement: from the arched roof [...] Pendant by suttle Magic many a row [...] Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed [...] With Naphtha and Asphaltus yeilded light [...] As from a sky. The hasty multitude [...] 730 [...] Admiring enter'd, and the work some praise [...] And some the Architect: his hand was known [...] In Heav'n by many a Towred structure high, [...] Where Scepter'd Angels held thir residence, [...] And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King [...] Exalted to such power, and gave to rule, [...] Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright. [...] Nor was his name unheard or unador'd [...] In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land [...] Men call'd him Mulciber; and how he fell [...] 740 [...] From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry Jove [...] Sheer o're the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn [...] To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve, [...] A Summers day; and with the setting Sun [...] Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star, [...] On Lemnos th' Aegaean Ile: thus they relate, [...] Erring; for he with this rebellious rout [...] Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now [...] To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape [...] By all his <b>Engins,</b> but was headlong sent [...] 750 [...] With his industrious crew to build in hell. [...] Mean while the winged Haralds by command [...] Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony [...] And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim [...] A solemn Councel forthwith to be held [...] At Pandaemonium, the high Capital [...] Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call'd [...] From every and Band squared Regiment [...] By place or choice the worthiest; they anon [...] With hundreds and with thousands trooping came [...] 760 [...] Attended: all access was throng'd, the Gates [...] And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall [...] (Though like a cover'd field, where Champions bold [...] Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chair [...] Defi'd the best of Panim chivalry [...] To mortal combat or carreer with Lance) [...] Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air, [...] Brusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees [...] In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides, [...] Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive [...] 770 [...] In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers [...] Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank, [...] The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel, [...] New rub'd with Baume, expatiate and confer [...] Thir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd [...] Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n, [...] Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd [...] In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons [...] Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room [...] Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race [...] 780 [...] Beyond the Indian Mount, or Faerie Elves, [...] Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side [...] Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees, [...] Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon [...] Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth [...] Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth & dance [...] Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear; [...] At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds. [...] Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms [...] Reduc'd thir shapes immense, and were at large, [...] 790 [...] Though without number still amidst the Hall [...] Of that infernal Court. But far within [...] And in thir own dimensions like themselves [...] The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim [...] In close recess and secret conclave sat [...] A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat's, [...] Frequent and full. After short silence then [...] And summons read, the great consult began.|$|E
