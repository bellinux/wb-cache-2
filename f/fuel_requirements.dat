5|$|The {{exploration}} of Jupiter {{has been conducted}} via close observations by automated spacecraft. It began {{with the arrival of}} Pioneer 10 into the Jovian system in 1973, and, , has continued with eight further spacecraft missions. All of these missions were undertaken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and all but two have been flybys that take detailed observations without the probe landing or entering orbit. These probes make Jupiter the most visited of the Solar System's outer planets as all missions to the outer Solar System have used Jupiter flybys to reduce <b>fuel</b> <b>requirements</b> and travel time. On 5 July 2016, spacecraft Juno arrived and entered the planet's orbit—the second craft ever to do so. Sending a craft to Jupiter entails many technical difficulties, especially due to the probes' large <b>fuel</b> <b>requirements</b> and the effects of the planet's harsh radiation environment.|$|E
5|$|Four British {{transports}} were considered: the Blackburn Beverley, Bristol 179B, Bristol 195 and Short PD 16/1. The mission also {{assessed the}} American Fairchild C-119G Flying Boxcar, Fairchild C-123 Provider and Lockheed C-130A Hercules. Of these types, the mission assessed that the Beverley, C-123 and C-130 could potentially meet the RAAF's requirements. Following further {{consideration of the}} options after their return to Australia, in early 1955 {{the members of the}} mission unanimously recommended that Hercules be procured, as the other two types did not meet {{some of the most important}} elements of the requirement. At this time the Australian Government was reluctant to fund any new equipment for the RAAF, and a decision to acquire twelve C-130s was not made until mid-1957. A contract for these aircraft was signed in October that year. The Australian C-130As were to be similar to those in service with the United States Air Force (USAF), the main difference being the use of TF56-A-11 engines in the place of the usual TF56-A-1 and TF56-A-9s; these engines provided almost the same power, but were modified to meet Australian <b>fuel</b> <b>requirements.</b> The total cost for the aircraft, initial crew training and support equipment was $US36 million (equivalent to about 16 million Australian pounds).|$|E
25|$|Some {{dewatering}} objectives include {{reducing the}} volume {{to reduce the}} transport and storage costs, removing liquids before landfill disposal, reducing <b>fuel</b> <b>requirements</b> before further drying or incineration, producing adequate material for composting, avoiding runoff and pooling when used for land applications, and optimizing other drying processes. Belt filters are specifically designed {{for each of these}} particular applications and feeds.|$|E

50|$|The lignite seam {{was first}} exposed in August 1961 and regular mining of lignite {{commenced}} in May 1962. German excavation technology in open cast mining, using Bucket Wheel Excavators, Conveyors and Spreaders {{were used for}} the first time in the country in Neyveli Mine-I. The capacity of this mine was 6.5 MT which met the <b>fuel</b> <b>requirement</b> of TS-I. The capacity was increased to 10.5MT of lignite per annum from March 2003 under Mine-I expansion scheme and at present meets the <b>fuel</b> <b>requirement</b> for generating power from TPS-I and TPS-I Expansion.|$|R
25|$|Airlines use futures {{contracts}} and derivatives to hedge {{their exposure to}} the price of jet fuel. They know that they must purchase jet fuel {{for as long as they}} want to stay in business, and fuel prices are notoriously volatile. By using crude oil futures contracts to hedge their <b>fuel</b> <b>requirements</b> (and engaging in similar but more complex derivatives transactions), Southwest Airlines was able to save a large amount of money when buying fuel as compared to rival airlines when fuel prices in the U.S. rose dramatically after the 2003 Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
25|$|The Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, Canada, {{approved}} in April 2008 the Renewable and Low Carbon <b>Fuel</b> <b>Requirements</b> Act, which mandates fuel suppliers in B.C. to sell gasoline and diesel containing 5% and 4% percent renewable fuels, respectively, by 2010, {{and allows the}} provincial government to set thresholds for the carbon intensity of fuels, taking into account their entire carbon footprint. The RLCFR Act also provides flexibility for regulated fuel suppliers to meet their obligations as they may receive notional transfers of renewable fuels and of attributable greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
25|$|The chylomicrons {{circulate}} {{throughout the}} body, giving the blood plasma a milky, or creamy appearance after a fatty meal. Lipoprotein lipase on the endothelial {{surfaces of the}} capillaries, especially in adipose tissue, but {{to a lesser extent}} also in other tissues, partially digests the chylomicrons into free fatty acids, glycerol and chylomicron remnants. The fatty acids are absorbed by the adipocytes, but the glycerol and chylomicron remnants remain in the blood plasma, ultimately to be removed from the circulation by the liver. The free fatty acids released by the digestion of the chylomicrons are absorbed by the adipocytes, where they are resynthesized into triglycerides using glycerol derived from glucose in the glycolytic pathway. These triglycerides are stored, until needed for the <b>fuel</b> <b>requirements</b> of other tissues, in the fat droplet of the adipocyte.|$|E

Energy integration of fired heaters with the background process helps in targeting <b>fuel</b> <b>requirement</b> and air preheat temperature {{prior to its}} detailed design. Existing integration procedures are applicable for processes with single fired heater only. However, in certain processes, multiple fired heaters are required to satisfy the total hot utility demand. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to target the number of fired heaters. <b>Fuel</b> <b>requirement</b> and air preheat temperature for every fired heater {{may have to be}} re-estimated to set achievable targets.

50|$|Although from a {{technical}} {{point of view}} it was superior to its contemporaries, the low number produced, shortages in qualified crew and the considerable <b>fuel</b> <b>requirement</b> {{in a context of}} ever shrinking resources prevented the Tiger I from having a real impact on the war.|$|R
50|$|Catalytic oxidizers {{can also}} be {{in the form of}} recuperative heat {{recovery}} to reduce the <b>fuel</b> <b>requirement.</b> In this form of heat recovery, the hot exhaust gases from the oxidizer pass through an heat exchanger to heat the new incoming air to the oxidizer.|$|R
25|$|Although bearing some {{resemblance}} to the jet powered Avro Tudor 8 and 9 (the former flying on jet power in 1948 and the latter becoming the experimental Avro Ashton first flying in 1950), Floyd's design was conceived from the outset as a commercial jet airliner. The updated design was presented in October 1948, and in February 1948 TCA responded with changes of their own. Now they wanted the aircraft to cruise at , and they increased the <b>fuel</b> <b>requirements</b> to allow for wider diversions. In April, Gordon McGregor took over the presidency of TCA, and told Smye {{that he did not}} want it to be the first airline with a jet. Nevertheless, the project pressed on, and was the topic of a major article in Aviation Week that November.|$|E
25|$|As the RAF {{presence}} in France was reduced, its aviation <b>fuel</b> <b>requirements</b> fell and by 5 June, {{most of the}} RAF aircraft had returned to England but deliveries continued. British armoured units also made less demand on fuel supplies {{as the number of}} vehicles dwindled, until the main users of fuel were the transport echelons of the front-line units and the lines-of-communication troops, which could be supplied by the fuel delivered up to the end of May. Karslake wrote that the small number of armoured vehicles removed from France was a mystery and that a train with the last tanks of the 2nd Armoured Brigade and some of those of the 3rd Armoured Brigade had departed from Le Mans for St Malo and disappeared. It was rumoured that the train had been sidelined by the French and the engine removed for another train but no effort was made by the road parties outside Brest to find their vehicles. No party accompanied the vehicles and no aircraft reconnaissance was sought, even though the Germans were a long way from Brittany.|$|E

2500|$|The Goldfinch first flew in May 1927, and in December {{it went to}} RAF Martlesham Heath for trials {{where it}} proved fast and high with a rapid climb rate, and {{generally}} good manoeverability, although spinning behaviour was substandard.

2500|$|On October 15, 2014, it was {{revealed}} that Hubble's search had uncovered three potential targets, temporarily designated PT1 ("potential target 1"), PT2 and PT3 by the New Horizons team. All are objects with estimated diameters in the [...] range, too small to be seen by ground telescopes, at distances from the Sun of 43–44 AU, which would put the encounters in the 2018–2019 period. The initial estimated probabilities that these objects are reachable within New Horizons fuel budget are 100%, 7%, and 97%, respectively. All are members of the [...] "cold" [...] (low-inclination, low-eccentricity) classical Kuiper belt, and thus very different from Pluto. [...] PT1 (given the temporary designation [...] "1110113Y" [...] on the HST web site), the most favorably situated object, is magnitude 26.8, [...] in diameter, and will be encountered around January 2019. A course change to reach it required about 35% of New Horizons available trajectory-adjustment fuel supply. [...] A mission to PT3 was in some ways preferable, in that it is brighter and therefore probably larger than PT1, but the greater <b>fuel</b> <b>requirements</b> to reach it would have left less for maneuvering and unforeseen events. Once sufficient orbital information was provided, the Minor Planet Center gave provisional designations to the three target KBOs: [...] (PT1), [...] (PT2), and [...] (PT3). By the fall of 2014, a possible fourth target, , had been eliminated by follow-up observations. PT2 was out of the running before the Pluto flyby.

40|$|Energy {{integration}} of a fired heater with the background process helps in targeting <b>fuel</b> <b>requirement</b> {{and the air}} preheat temperature prior to its detailed design. Existing integration procedures are applicable only for processes with a single fired heater. However, in certain processes, multiple fired heaters are required to satisfy the total hot utility demand. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to target the minimum number of fired heaters. To synthesize an energy integrated heat recovery network that incorporates a single fired heater, a cold stream should enter the fired heater at the pinch temperature, and the heat capacity of the cold stream should be within a permissible range. For processes with multiple fired heaters, the duties of different fired heaters may be varied to simplify {{the design of the}} overall heat exchanger network. Entry conditions for cold process streams to the fired heaters are also established, to satisfy the overall energy target.

40|$|Lithium plasma facing {{components}} {{reduce the}} flux of “recycled ” particles entering the plasma edge from the plasma facing components. This results in increased external <b>fueling</b> <b>requirements</b> {{and provides the}} opportunity to control the magnitude and distribution of the incoming particle flux. It has been predicted that the plasma density profile will then {{be determined by the}} deposition profile of the external fueling, rather than dominated by the recycled particle flux. A series of experiments on the Lithium Tokamak Experiment demonstrate that lithium wall coatings facilitate control of the neutral and plasma particle inventories. With fresh lithium coatings and careful gas injection programming, over 90 % of the injected particle inventory can be absorbed in the lithium wall during a discharge. Furthermore, dramatic changes in the <b>fueling</b> <b>requirements</b> and plasma parameters were observed when lithium coatings were applied. This is largely due to the elimination of water as an impurity on the plasma facing components. A Molecular Cluster Injector (MCI) was developed for the fueling of LTX plasmas...|$|R
40|$|This book {{describes}} the Exergy-based Input – Output (ExIO) framework, a comprehensive methodology {{for assessing the}} primary fossil <b>fuels</b> <b>requirements</b> {{for the production of}} goods and services within a given economy from a lifecycle perspective. In the ExIO approach, exergy is assumed to be the best suited thermodynamic metric for characterizing fossil fuels. The mathematical formulation of ExIO is based on Input-Output analysis, which defines boundaries in time and space for any system or product analyzed, encompassing its entire lifecycle. The Hybrid-ExIO approach has been developed to increase the accuracy of results and to analyze energy systems in detail, leading to the definition of criteria and indicators for identifying and optimizing the primary fossil <b>fuels</b> <b>requirements</b> of system products. Lastly, the Bioeconomic ExIO model has been proposed to account for the side effects that the working hours required for producing goods and services have on the total primary fossil fuels consumption. As such, the book will be of considerable interest to both researchers and engineers in industry, offering them essential guidelines on the utilization of exergy and thermoeconomic analysis...|$|R
