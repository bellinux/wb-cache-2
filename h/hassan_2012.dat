Single study (Badr El Dine and El Shafei, 2015) was conducted for only sex determination from the first lumbar vertebra (L 1) among Egyptians; they tested 24 measurements taken from CT of T 12 and L 1 to evaluate their role in sex identification. Although the same measurements were taken from both vertebrae with the same method, the results showed great difference. For T 12; 14 measurements of 24 were significant and sex was predicted at accuracy rate of 93.1, while for L 1; only seven measurements of 24 were significant and sex identification accuracy was very low (68 %) (Badr El Dine and El Shafei, 2015). For this reason, this study aims to reassess the role of the first lumber (L 1) vertebra in sex identification in addition to age estimation which wasn’t tested in the previous study.|$|E

We derive sufficient statistics for examining whether subsidies for child health investments generate such Laffer effects under a fairly general class of assumptions about the labor market impacts of child health investments and on the presence and nature of externalities from reduced disease transmission. We find that subsidies for child deworming in Kenya raised adult earnings, and hence the NPV of tax revenues, sufficiently to allow Pareto-improving revenue-neutral reductions in tax rates. Consistent with Pitt, Rosenzweig, and <b>Hassan</b> (<b>2012),</b> we estimate differing labor market impacts of child health investments by gender. Ten years {{after the start of}} the deworming program, men who were eligible to participate as boys work 3. 5 more hours each week, spend more time in entrepreneurship, are more likely to hold manufacturing jobs with higher wage earnings, and have higher living standards. Women who were eligible as girls have better educational outcomes, are more likely to grow cash crops, and reallocate labor time from agriculture to entrepreneurship. We also find evidence that deworming generates positiv...|$|E
40|$|The {{hospitality}} and tourism {{is one of}} the largest economic contributors for Malaysia (Economic Impact, 2012). Malaysia is emerging as a fast growing free market economy with services as the main source of economic growth accounting for almost three quarter of Malaysia’s output with 26 percent of its labor force (MIS Asia, 2010). In general, by 2020, there will be a total of 1. 6 billion jobs in the hotel industry (Travel & Tourism, 2011). Thus, there is a significant need in having a more qualified, motivated and skilled manpower available to meet the challenges of this ever changing and demanding industry (Ahmad, Aziz, Kamaruddin, Aziz & Bakhtiar, 2012). Similar to the developed countries, hotels in Malaysia are facing problems in attracting and retaining skilled and knowledgeable of high and low level employees. This is due to low salary and rigid job traits (Ahmad, Solnet & Scott, 2010). The rapid expansion of the hotel industry has exaggerated the demand for employment of competent employees (Ahmad & Zainol, 2011), and this resulted in skilled and knowledgeable workers shortages (Business Monitor International Ltd., 2010). On the other hand, the shortage of skilled workers in Malaysian hotels is caused by the unattractive work atmosphere and unmotivated factors of the industry (Kasimu, Zaiton & <b>Hassan,</b> <b>2012)</b> ...|$|E

40|$|In the end,” writes Ralph Poore for Focus on Boise State, “a flipped {{classroom}} [one {{in which}} {{technology is a}} primary learning tool] encourages students {{to be responsible for}} their own learning, and to make it a lifelong habit” (Poore 2013). This notion of individual success {{is at the heart of}} the recent movement of higher education into the digital realm. Neoliberal discourses, making reference to individual responsibility, market forces, progress, and so on, have been used to justify many developments in higher education. Technology, specifically digital and electronic technologies like computers and smart phones, has entered into the university setting in ways that both challenge and exacerbate the neoliberal activities of individualization and privatization. Technology is described as being nimble, entrepreneurial, flexible, and always progressive within neoliberal discourses. Through these activities, inequalities of class, age, ability, gender, and race are masked behind neoliberal notions of ‘progress’ and ‘equality for a broad and diverse populace,’ creating shifting dynamics of power in the university’s social structure. A student must now interact with the university through a multitude of technologies. Classroom activities, registration, contacts with student services, and even common university activities like student organization elections have all become increasingly digitized. Perhaps students, now more than ever, are evidence that “the relation between organism and machine has been a border war” (Haraway 1991). Technology is imbued with political power, and is indeed the “form, function and expression of a discourse of information that is also a discourse of domination” (<b>Hassan</b> <b>2012).</b> Due to the increasing cost of higher education, combined with the high cost of technology, the responsibility for teaching and learning is shifting to mask the neoliberal influence on the digitization of the university, which lends to the scapegoating of certain groups. In light of this information, I would like to explore the questions: how have neoliberal discourses of technology affected student stratification? As a method of inquiry, I plan to ask how do students’ beliefs and experiences affect their ability and desire to become a ‘virtual student citizen?...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} communication on the micro-blogging service Twitter {{during the}} 2011 UK riots. It examines the complex constructive relationship between software and collective meaning-making {{during a period}} of acute social crisis and asks whether Twitter&rsquo;s software-structures facilitated productive, democratic discourse. While politicians rushed to impose &lsquo;Victorian&rsquo; condemnation on the moral failings of rioters and their families (Bridges 2012) the broadcast and print media delivered commentary that was reductive, politicised and polemical (Kelsey 2012). These concerns, combined with an absence of rigorous, critical oversight, suggest a failing of the public sphere. While some theorists have argued that Internet media should be capable of fulfilling a normative-democratic role (Kellner 2004), the temporality of Internet-enabled communication may undermine democratic expectations, because the rapidity of information flow stresses the deliberative period (Barber 2006, <b>Hassan</b> <b>2012,</b> Buchstein 2002). To examine this issue, the conceptual framework identifies several &lsquo;logics&rsquo; by which the software-constructed temporality of communication should interact with the normative requirements of deliberative exchange. These logics frame the development of an empirical methodology. Analysis of thematic content, deliberative potential and the constructive influence of Twitter time-space in the riot public produces the following key findings. 1. The most dominant thematic concerns reflect closely discourse in the wider mediasphere. Twitter users strive to explain the riots, seeking and analysing socio-structural causes 2. There is clear evidence of a relationship between software-structures and discourse. Twitter&rsquo;s hashtag syntax supports thematically and deliberatively discreet discourse streams. 3. Deliberative tweets concentrate in the #UKRiots stream, suggesting that there may be discreet &lsquo;hashtag cultures&rsquo; on Twitter &ndash; communities that are shaped by (or themselves shape) structural identifiers and are committed to a certain type of discourse. 4. While such hashtag cultures may suggest coordination, Twitter permits different &lsquo;langues&# 039; that discourage deliberation. Analysis across the structural layers finds little evidence of ideal speech conditions. 5. The majority of tweets contain links to external media, and this has implications both for the deliberative potential of tweets. The logic of hyperlinking &lsquo;defers&rsquo; meaning in complex ways. Locating and &lsquo;restricting&rsquo; meaning is thus extremely difficult. 6. There is some evidence that the temporality of hashtag streams may reveal something about the dynamics of discourse coordination. As stream density increases, communicative reasoning may become more difficult. These findings suggest some important conclusions about the democratic potential of Twitter discourse and some priorities for future research. Principal among these is a call for greater dialogue between the computing, statistical and social sciences.

40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 -IntroductionToday, with {{advances in}} the technology of weapons and military equipment, urban areas are most at risk of invasion. Among {{the most important factors}} in enhancing human casualties in military attacks on urban areas, one can point to the unrealistic architecture of houses which does not conform to principles such as optimal site selection and layout of the structure of human settlements, proper distribution, principles of concealment, camouflage and deception, the high degree of vulnerability of buildings and interior architecture of buildings with regard to passive defense. Structural arrangement of spaces and their connection with surrounding areas has created great opportunities for saving lives And improves system performance and reduces its vulnerability. This study with a descriptive-qualitative approach, investigates the role of passive defense in urban housing planning and the conclusions are used to create safe city, strong city and deterrent city. Results show that determining the geometric design of house, pop location, availability and predictability of secure spaces are regarded as multi-functional space for each building in times of peace and war are among the optimal components of building architecture and vernacular architecture {{from the perspective of a}} passive defense. Crises, threats and disasters are classified into two main categories: natural, including earthquakes, floods, landslides, droughts and human category such as war, accidents and diseases which are more than 50 types. The main objective of this study is investigating crisis caused by war in residential areas. In the full-scale military conflicts, one of the ultimate goals of the parties involved is making an effort to bring the breadth and scope of the battlefield to civilian centers especially to urban centers, which is usually accompanied by heavy air strikes. This act is one of the most effective strategies in the fate of wars. Dragging wars to residential areas is usually accompanied by extensive damage and high human casualties and if there is no planning at macro measures in peacetime, during the war casualties would be double and it would bring terrible psychological burden for politicians and top military commanders. Among the main factors increasing the number of people killed and injured in the military attacks we can point to security attacks and natural and unexpected disasters occurring in urban areas and the high vulnerability of buildings which are resulted from the improper planning of housing, inadequate spatial layout and structured problems, construction engineering problems (unsafe structures and fortifications), inappropriate architecture (not anticipating the shelter, open spaces, etc.), non-standard communication networks and etc. Thus, regarding key principles underlying passive defense in buildings can be considered as bedrock for the development of sustainable security in urban areas. Another major cause of casualties in urban warfare is the population growth in urban areas due to excessive migration and unplanned growth of non-standard and unsafe human settlements in the margin of urban areas (e. g. Tehran metropolitan). So that in 1900, 29 % of the world population lived in urban areas and in 1950, this rate increased to 49 % and according to UN statistics; in 2010 this percentage was more than 75 % (Vautravers, 2010, p. 438). 2 - Theoretical basesThe main objective of this study was to investigate and analyze structural and architectural factors affecting patterns of planning and design of housing in urban areas in order to deal with the effects of enemy invasion to residential areas and based on this, the hypothesis of the study has been developed which seems that the optimal pattern of planning of urban settlements and giving priority to housing planning based on defensive architecture and passive defense principles are among the major factors in reducing casualties and financial losses in residential areas during the crisis. The research method was descriptive - analytical. Data were gathered and analyzed through sources and documents available in libraries. 3 – DiscussionUrban housingHousing is one of the affective indicators in the mortality caused by military invasion to the cities. Since housing is known as the basic of urban fabric. The housing issue is broad and complex and has various dimensions. Housing has a physical location and is regarded as a shelter, basic and primary need of individuals. In this shelter, some of the family or individual's primary needs such as food, rest, and protection against environmental conditions are met (Pourmohammadi, 2009, 3). Housing planning is part of the urban planning in which residential units are considered as part of the deformed and adopted spaces which will be considered with regard to their subjects in the housing planning framework. Based on this, housing planning deals with allocating habitable spaces to needs of residential housing and paying attention to the limitation of resources and the use of special techniques, theories with social, cultural, political and economic frameworks. Passive defense principles in the design and construction of urban human settlementsDefensive architecture of the building is presented in order to get ready for more attacks against military and other natural disasters. Passive defense considerations in housing are crystallized in three categories of architecture, structural strength and installations. In architecture, attending principles such as optimal site selection and layout of buildings, the proper dispersion, observing such principles as camouflage, concealment and deception principles and high-grade restoration of interior architecture of buildings is important (Faraji Mollaei and Azimi, 2011, 998). The structural arrangement and connection with surrounding areas has provided great resources to save lives and has improved the system performance and reduced its vulnerability. Determining the geometric design, pop location, availability and predicting secure spaces as multiple performance spaces for each building in peacetime and war are the responsibility of architects. Architects should design the space to suit the needs of the user so that in addition to the defensive performance in the time of war, it has appropriate use in time of peace (21 st issue of the National Building Regulations, 2009, 3 - 4). The structural aspect of buildings deals with how to design the building to resist the explosive loads. This work is the responsibility of Structural Engineers. In order to have the right structural system and choosing the appropriate section of the building for secure space, architectural plans must be coordinated with the structural issue. In the facility sector, it is to prevent the damage caused by the blast effects, such as gas leaks, flooding, electrical hazards, fire and installing alarm system. Limited utilization capacity or variability of building facility systems consistent with the desired performance is considered by facilities engineers. 4 - Conclusion Urban housing planning must be designed and implemented under this title. In addition to attending the social, economic and security issues, it should seek to achieve the goal of increasing the nation's capacity to deal with threats and potential harms and to promote empowerment and national tolerance for dealing with emergency situations. From the discussed issue, we can conclude that it is possible to decrease the severity and extent of damage caused by enemy attacks during crises cassette through applying appropriate architecture measures with a defensive approach, considering the 16 principles of passive defense consistent with the physical and special properties of cities and especially in urban residential areas, while creating beautiful spaces without compromising space and their functionality and without spending too much cost. This work involves the national resolute determination of relevant organizations which is possible with the cooperation and synergy of organizations. 5 - Suggestions In order to reach housing programs with an appropriate level of safety based on passive defense principles the following suggestions are offered: Comprehensive housing plan for the development of quality of buildings along its quantitative development. Considering the safety of the buildings. Preparation of passive defense guidelines based on safe housing planning. Compilation of architectural document requirements in the design of buildings with passive defense approach. Planning for reducing physical instability of residential buildings in the historic fabric and marginal areas. Paying special attention to textures and old residential areas in central cities, and granting support from government facilities for strengthening, upgrading and refurbishment of old buildings.

On 31 January 2010, Hassan picked up his fourth Africa Cup of Nations winners's medal as Egypt defeated Ghana 1-0 in the final.In November 2011, Hassan played his 178th game for Egypt in a friendly against Brazil. In doing so he matched the record for international appearances. On 27 March <b>2012,</b> <b>Hassan</b> started a friendly match against Kenya breaking the world record for most international appearances for any international male player with 181 matches played.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the relationship between capital structure and firm performance of listed non financial corporations in Tanzania. The study used panel data for the period of 5 years from 8 non financial firms listed on the Dar es salaam Stock Exchange. Study use mixed model repeated measure to estimate the relationship between capital structure and firm performance where, capital structure was proxied by debt ratio and debt-to equity ratio while performance was proxied by return on assets and return on equity. The study reveals Tanzania listed non financial firms are financed more by equity capital than debt financing. Results also show that listed non financial firms perform below average. The study results indicate significant negative relationship between return on assets and debt to equity ratio, return on assets and debt ratio, and return on equity and debt ratio. However, the relationship between return on equity and debt to equity ratio was positive but insignificant. The results are consistent with previous studies conducted by Kipesha and Moshi (2014); Pastory et al. (2011); Kandongo et al. (2014); Anarfo (2015); Kajananthan et al. (2013); <b>Hassan</b> et al. (<b>2012).</b> Key words: Capital structure, Firm performance, Tanzania. ...|$|R

The present study proposes a fuzzy mathematical model of HIV infection consisting of a linear fuzzy differential equations (FDEs) system describing the ambiguous immune cells level and the viral load which are due to the intrinsic fuzziness of the immune system’s strength in HIV-infected patients. The immune cells in question are considered CD 4 + T-cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). The dynamic behavior of the immune cells level and the viral load within the three groups of patients with weak, moderate, and strong immune systems are analyzed and compared. Moreover, the approximate explicit solutions of the proposed model are derived using a fitting-based method. In particular, a fuzzy control function indicating the drug dosage is incorporated into the proposed model and a fuzzy optimal control problem (FOCP) minimizing both the viral load and the drug costs is constructed. An optimality condition is achieved as a fuzzy boundary value problem (FBVP). In addition, the optimal fuzzy control function is completely characterized and a numerical solution for the optimality system is computed. 1...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to detect the virulence factors, serogroups, and antibiotic resistance properties of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, by using 268 bovine mastitic milk samples which were diagnosed using California Mastitis Test. After E. coli identification, PCR assays were developed for detection of different virulence genes, serogroups, and antibiotic resistance genes of Escherichia coli. The antibiotic resistance pattern was studied using disk diffusion method. Out of 268 samples, 73 (27. 23 %) were positive for Escherichia coli, and, out of 73 positive samples, 15 (20. 54 %) were O 26 and 11 (15. 06 %) were O 157 so they were the highest while O 111 was not detected in any sample so it was the lowest serogroup. Out of 73 STEC strains, 11 (15. 06 %) and 36 (49. 31 %) were EHEC and AEEC, respectively. All of the EHEC strains had stx 1, eaeA, and ehly, virulence genes, while in AEEC strains stx 1 had the highest prevalence (77. 77 %), followed by eaeA (55. 55 %). Totally, aadA 1 (65. 95 %) had the highest while blaSHV (6. 38 %) had the lowest prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes. The disk diffusion method showed that the STEC strain...|$|R

The aims {{of the current study}} were to detect the virulence factors and antibiotic resistance of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, in animal milk and dairy products in Iran. After E. coli dentification with culture method, PCR assay were developed for detection of pathogenic genes, serotypes and antibiotic resistance genes of E. coli. Results showed that out of 719 samples, 102 (14. 18 %) were confirmed to be positive for E. coli and out of 102 positive samples, 17. 64 % were O 26 and 13. 72 % were O 157 and 1. 96 % were O 91 and 1. 96 % were O 145 serotypes. Totally, the prevalence of stx 1 and papA genes were the highest while the prevalence of sfaS and fyuA were the lowest in the positive samples. PCR results showed that tetA, tetB were the highest (64. 70 %) and aac(3) -IV were the lowest (27. 45 %) antibiotic resistant genes in E. coli positive samples. Our study indicated that the isolated E. coli trains in these regions had a highest antibiotic resistance to tetracycline (58. 82 %) and the lowest to nitrofurantoin (3. 92 %). tetA gene and E. coli O 157 serotype had highest and aac(3) -IV gene, and E. coli O 145 serotype had a lowest frequency rates of antibiotics resistanc...|$|R
