30|$|The {{results for}} the {{estimation}} via 2 SLS are displayed in Table 10. In the regressions for the Spanish subsample, the marginal effects of Tangibility are negative and highly significant, and they are substantially higher than those estimated without instrumenting the regressor. They are also economically significant. A 1  % increase in Tangibility—a small change, as its mean equals 85  % and its standard deviation 101  %—decreases the probability of filing for bankruptcy by a Spanish micro firm by around 0.03  %. 38 As the unconditional probability 39 of those firms is 3.6  %, the estimated semielasticity is 0.83  %, which is a sizeable effect. By contrast, the marginal effects of Tangibility are positive and significant both in France and the UK. This latter result {{is consistent with the}} results of Davydenko and Franks (2008) on their study of French, UK and German firms that defaulted on their bank debt. They find that higher levels <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> imply a significantly higher incidence of bankruptcies and a somewhat higher probability of liquidation, suggesting that banks use formal bankruptcy procedures to <b>force</b> a <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> in those countries. This is not the Spanish case, as there is an alternative insolvency procedure, a mortgage foreclosure, through which collateral can be more efficiently liquidated.|$|R

40|$|The United States Circuit Courts of Appeals {{are split}} {{on how to}} {{calculate}} restitution in a criminal loan fraud situation where collateral is involved. This trend is best illustrated in cases involving mortgage fraud. The split stems from disagreement over how {{to account for the}} lender’s receipt <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> property. The Third, Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Circuit Courts of Appeals consider the property returned when the person defrauded receives cash from the <b>sale</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> property. The Second, Fifth, and Ninth Circuits deem the property returned when the lender takes ownership <b>of</b> the <b>collateral</b> property. This Note argues that the former conception of the offset value ought to govern. This Note also supports a view of property that considers the lender’s lost opportunity from fraud. Even when restitution is mandatory, the governing rule should take into account the alternative investment the lender would have made if there had been no fraud...|$|R
