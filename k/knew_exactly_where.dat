5|$|Second, Giáp made {{a mistake}} in Nà Sản by {{committing}} his forces to reckless frontal attacks before being fully prepared. He learned his lesson: at Điện Biên Phủ, Giáp spent months meticulously stockpiling ammunition and emplacing heavy artillery and antiaircraft guns before making his move. Teams of Viet Minh volunteers were sent into the French camp to scout the disposition of the French artillery. Wooden artillery pieces were built as decoys and the real guns were rotated every few salvos to confuse French counterbattery fire. As a result, when the battle finally began, the Viet Minh <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> the French artillery pieces were, while the French did not even know how many guns Giáp possessed.|$|E
5|$|The {{desalination}} plant {{was impossible to}} hide, and since it had been built by the Italians, the enemy <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> and what it was. Proud and Murray Dixon therefore disguised the plant {{to look as if}} it had been destroyed by a bomb. A trompe l'oeil black hole was painted over the top and one side of the building, along with shrapnel marks, shortly after a real attack which fortunately missed the plant; a disused chimney was actually demolished; real rubble, empty oil drums and real wrecked vehicles, which were in plentiful supply, were brought to decorate the compound; and some fake craters were constructed and decorated as if a stick of bombs had fallen right on target. The finishing touch was some real smoke from burning oily rags. The plant was not attacked again.|$|E

25|$|On 15 December, a huge Japanese fleet was amassed in Sach'on Bay, on {{the east}} end of the Noryang Strait. Shimazu was not sure whether the allied fleet was {{continuing}} the blockade of Konishi's wajō, on its way to attack an abandoned wajō further east or blocking their way on the western end of Noryang Strait.

25|$|In October 2009, Asharq Al-Awsat {{reported}} that a senior Israeli defense official had told the newspaper that Israel <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> Shalit was being held, and was keeping the location under constant surveillance. The newspaper {{reported that}} Hamas was aware that Israel knew Shalit's location, and responded by booby-trapping the area, surrounding it with explosives in a 400–500-meter radius, and issuing a directive to kill Shalit if Israel mounted a military rescue operation.|$|E
25|$|The Littorio {{was held}} in reserve behind the Infantry {{divisions}} {{to the rear of}} Miteirya Ridge on the 25 October the Axis forces launched a series of attacks using 15th Panzer and Littorio divisions. The Panzerarmee was probing for a weakness, but found none. When the sun set the Allied infantry went on the attack and around midnight 51st (Highland) Division launched three attacks, but no one <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> they were. Pandemonium and carnage ensued, resulting in the loss of over 500 Allied troops, and leaving only one officer among the attacking forces. By this time the Trento Division had lost half its infantry and most of its artillery, 164th Light Afrika Division had lost two battalions and although the 15th Panzer and Littorio Divisions had held off the Allied armour, this had proved costly and most units were under strength.|$|E

500|$|Work on {{the soundtrack}} began after {{completion}} of the game, {{similar to the way}} movie soundtracks are made. The idea was to create music that would specifically reflect each level art-style and events. As the game had an [...] "on rail" [...] progression system, the developers <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> the player would be at any given time, so they showed videos to the composer and asked him to write specifically timed pieces that would match the player's progression in each level. The soundtrack was outsourced to Yoshitaka Azuma, who was composing music for NHK TV programs at that time. The music of Panzer Dragoon is a mix between orchestral and synthesizer tracks.|$|E
500|$|EastEnders: E20 {{was filmed}} {{on the same}} set as EastEnders, using three {{handheld}} cameras {{to give it a}} more [...] "edgy" [...] feel compared to EastEnders, which is filmed with cameras on tripods. Director Michael Keillor stated that although using handheld cameras is normally easier, the fact it was shot with a multiple-camera setup made it more challenging and created problems for the lighting and props teams as nobody <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> the camera would be. Keillor said it was a [...] "particularly tough day" [...] when filming a party scene in a flat, as normally walls of the set would be removed but all the walls were left in to make it look more realistic, meaning the crew overheated. Series 1 was filmed over ten days with approximately 120 minutes of television being shot. Each of the first series' 12 episodes are between three and 16 minutes in length. The second series features 10 episodes averaging 14 minutes each, which was a response to complaints from viewers about the length of some of the episodes in series 1. Series 3 began production in May 2011, and took about four weeks to film.|$|E
500|$|Phips sailed {{from the}} Downs on 12 September 1686, and on 28 November arrived in Hispaniola, Samana Bay, where they {{spent two weeks}} {{restocking}} their water and provender. The weather was bad, and the search consequently did not get under way {{for a few more}} weeks. January 12, Phips sent out Captain Rogers in the smaller Henry of London along with three Native American divers (Jonas Abimeleck and John Pasqua, name of other diver not listed) to search what was then called the Ambrosia Bank (now the Silver Bank). There was a bit more delay from weather but Peter Earle writes, [...] "There is no doubt that he <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>where</b> he was going." [...] January 20, they spotted cannons from a shipwreck lying on the white sands of the reef. The ship they had found was the Almiranta of the Spanish silver fleet (later determined to be Nuestra Señora de la Concepción; the English did not know the name of the ship) wrecked in 1641. Over the next two days, the divers were able to bring up 3,000 coins and 3 silver bars. They decided to travel back to Phips' to let him know but {{this turned out to be}} a somewhat slow and treacherous trip among the reefs.|$|E

500|$|As part of Operation Collar in late November, Barham, Malaya and {{the carrier}} [...] covered the forces rendezvousing with a convoy coming from Gibraltar. En route, Eagles {{aircraft}} attacked Tripoli on 26 November. Barham became the flagship of the 1st BS in December. On 3 January 1941, the ship, together with Warspite and Valiant, bombarded Bardia {{as a prelude}} to the Battle of Bardia. On 26 March, the Italian fleet sortied in an attempt to intercept British convoys to Greece.

Admiral Angelo Iachino, commander of the Italian fleet, ordered the two other heavy cruisers of the 1st Division to render assistance to Pola in the darkness.

2500|$|The {{average age}} of the U.S. team was 21 years old, making it the {{youngest}} team in U.S. team history to play in the Olympics. It would be the youngest team in the Olympic tournament.

He'd push you right to the limit where you were ready to say, 'I've had it, I'm throwing it in'—and then he'd back off." [...] Brooks continued the organization by campaigning for the players' selection of Eruzione as the captain, and Craig had been the goalie for him in the 1979 World Championship tournament. Assistant coach Craig Patrick had played with Brooks on the 1967 U.S. national team.|$|E
