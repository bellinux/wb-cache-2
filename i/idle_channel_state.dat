30|$|In {{simulating}} channel access, both {{busy and}} idle channel statistics {{are taken into}} account. According to the empirical observation-based model given in [42], busy and <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> <b>state</b> transitions can be well approximated by the exponential distribution with a factor that changes with the traffic load. For the proposed method, the first energy detector is used to obtain the decision statistics. Next, decision statistics are fed to the prediction stage. Prediction is yielded by equal gain combining (α _i=α _j= 1 /L, ∀ i,j). Along with the past measurement results, prediction is quantified with the metric defined in Section 3. Finally, a binary decision is reached so that MSE is obtained for the performance evaluations. It should be stated {{at this point that}} equal gain combining might not be the optimal prediction strategy for many scenarios. However, it establishes simplicity in implementation from the practical point of view because it skips the stage at which the weighting coefficients are estimated. Therefore, equal gain combining is adopted in the numerical results.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a theoretical estimation for <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> {{time in a}} multi-hop environment. <b>Idle</b> <b>channel</b> time is the time proportion of a node during which the <b>channel</b> <b>state</b> is <b>idle.</b> Thus, {{it can be used}} to evaluate the available bandwidth. Major related work considers a cross-layer model, where the <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> time measure is available at the MAC layer, but it is rarely implemented. Furthermore, this measure is not very flexible: it cannot differentiate the traffic’s priorities and it works under the hypothesis that flows are strictly policed. Estimating instead of measuring the <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> time prevents these drawbacks. This estimation is computed in three steps by (1) calculating the <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> time bounds, (2) evaluating the probability of a given <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> time value, (3) computing the expected value of this distribution and deducing the average <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> time.

40|$|In a {{wireless}} network using CSMA for MAC, packet collisions can result {{either because of}} the vulnerability stemming from the <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> detection delay of the radio device or because of the hidden terminal problem. Both of these collision scenarios can be addressed by applying some additional structure to carrier sense-based channel access, sacrificing throughput to improve collision protection. Specifically, we assign a unique time slice to each contending transmitter {{that is designed to}} allow collision-free access to each data slot while still using carrier sense as the mechanism to determine <b>channel</b> <b>state.</b> The width of each time slice is equal to the <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> detection delay of the radio.

30|$|In this work, we have {{proposed}} a parallel sensing scheme for the cognitive radio ad hoc networks that efficiently discovers more <b>idle</b> <b>channels</b> from the primary user band, consequently leading to improved spectrum utilization, lower power consumption, and higher throughput. We have investigated the performance of proposed parallel sensing scheme through both mathematical analysis and simulations. Comparison with the SMC-MAC protocol [27] shows that the proposed parallel sensing scheme outperforms the SMC-MAC sensing scheme by finding more <b>idle</b> <b>channels</b> from the primary user band and also improves energy efficiency during the sensing phase by {{increasing the number of}} parallel groups. Most importantly, the proposed scheme provides higher system throughput as the duration of sensing phase is reduced through parallel sensing, resulting in increased transmission time for the SUs in a given cycle. The proposed parallel sensing scheme is particularly suitable for delay-sensitive applications in ad hoc cognitive radio networks as it discovers higher number of <b>idle</b> <b>channels</b> in less time, consumes lower energy, and affords enhanced throughput.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Opportunistic {{spectrum}} sharing (OSS) is a promising technique to improve spectrum utilization using cognitive radios. Unreliable spectrum sensing by cognitive radios is inevitable in the OSS system. In this paper, we analyze {{the types of}} unreliable sensing {{and their impact on}} the system performance. The secondary users equipped with cognitive radios sense channels that are unused by the primary users and utilize the <b>idle</b> <b>channels.</b> An ongoing secondary user also detects when a primary user accesses its channel and then either moves to another <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> or moves to a buffer if no <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> is available. Unreliable spectrum sensing is modeled by false alarm and misdetection events for both initiating and ongoing secondary users. We solve the steady-state probability vector of the system and derive a set of performance metrics of interest. Numerical results are presented to highlight the analysis. The proposed modeling method can be used to evaluate the performance of future opportunistic {{spectrum sharing}} networks...|$|R

30|$|To {{improve the}} {{utilization}} of LAA UL data transmission, a scheme called multi-subframe scheduling (MSS) was proposed in 3 GPP RAN 1 meeting [17, 18]. Different from the traditional scheduling scheme where a UL grant always indicates the resource allocation on a single subframe, MSS allows a UL grant to indicate resource allocation across multiple subframes. There {{are two kinds of}} MSS. The first one is that a UL grant can indicate data transmission on multiple subframes. That is, the UE which receives the grant can transmit data for multiple subframes rather than a single subframe as long as it has found an <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> before transmission. One may expect an increase of throughput as the number of subframes permitted for transmission increases. The second kind of MSS is that a UL grant can indicate multiple channel-sensing opportunities where UE can transmit data on a single subframe as long as it has found an <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> in one of the granted opportunities. By allowing more channel sensing opportunities, the probability for a UE to detect an <b>idle</b> <b>channel</b> increases.|$|R
