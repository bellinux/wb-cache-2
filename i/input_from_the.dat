This recurrent inhibition is a simple feedback circuit that can dampen excitatory responses in the hippocampus. The pyramidal cells gives a recurrent excitation which is an important mechanism found in some memory processing microcircuits.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species of}} fish and {{amphibians}} possess a lateral line system that senses pressure waves in water. One of the brain areas that receives primary <b>input</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lateral line organ, the medial octavolateral nucleus, has a cerebellum-like structure, with granule cells and parallel fibers. In electrosensitive fish, the <b>input</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> electrosensory system goes to the dorsal octavolateral nucleus, which also has a cerebellum-like structure. In ray-finned fishes (by far the largest group), the optic tectum has a layer—the marginal layer—that is cerebellum-like.|$|E

5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with the right side of the body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual <b>input</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory <b>input</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left side of the body, and visual <b>input</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left side of the visual field.|$|E
5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei to upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its <b>input</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pons mainly from the pontine nuclei. The input to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to {{different parts of}} the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle receives input from afferent fibers from the vestibular nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from the inferior peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory <b>input</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inferior olivary nucleus via the inferior cerebellar peduncle.|$|E

5|$|The lungs are {{supplied}} by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. <b>Input</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{parasympathetic nervous system}} occurs via the vagus nerve.

The lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.|$|E
5|$|The medial {{zone of the}} {{anterior}} and posterior lobes constitutes the spinocerebellum, also known as paleocerebellum.

5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine does not {{necessarily}} mean better sexual function; for example, people with injuries in the sacral region {{are less likely to be}} able to orgasm than those with injuries higher on the spine. Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require <b>input</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{sketches}} and songs were {{cast by the}} production team, sometimes acting on <b>input</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> show's stable of performers themselves. While certain roles naturally lent themselves to a particular actor, Norris said that confidence in the entire cast's ability was such that the producers also experimented with casting against type. The demands of filming thirteen episodes' worth of material in the same timeframe as a standard six-episode sketch show, while coping with the many complex makeup and wardrobe changes required, resulted in casting also being partially dependent on the logistics of moving a performer from one character to another. Recurring characters were {{if at all possible}} played by the actor who had originated the part, leading to the development of several signature roles, as for example Baynton's Charles II, Jim Howick's Shouty Man, Rickard's Bob Hale, Willbond's Henry VIII, Martha Howe-Douglas' Elizabeth I and Simon Farnaby's Death.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not only}} {{receptive}} fields that define the microzone structure: The climbing fiber <b>input</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inferior olivary nucleus is equally important. The branches of a climbing fiber (usually numbering about 10) usually activate Purkinje cells belonging to the same microzone. Moreover, olivary neurons that send climbing fibers to the same microzone tend to be coupled by gap junctions, which synchronize their activity, causing Purkinje cells within a microzone to show correlated complex spike activity on a millisecond time scale. Also, the Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone all send their axons to the same small cluster of output cells within the deep cerebellar nuclei. Finally, the axons of basket cells are much longer in the longitudinal direction than in the mediolateral direction, causing them to be confined largely to a single microzone. The consequence of all this structure is that cellular interactions within a microzone are much stronger than interactions between different microzones.|$|E

40|$|The hindpaw {{of the rat}} is {{normally}} innervated by the sciatic and saphenous nerves. In the present studies, the hindpaws of adult rats were partially deafferented by transection of the sciatic nerve for variable periods of time. The organization of the hindpaw representation in primary somatosensory (S-I) cortex was then studied with neurophysiological mapping techniques and compared to the organization seen in normal rats. The objective {{was to determine whether}} cutaneous responsiveness was recovered in the cortical area which lost normal cutaneous <b>inputs</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sciatic nerve, and, if recovery occurred, to characterize the time course and spatial extent of this recovery. Normal rats were found to have a topographically organized representation of the hindpaw in S-I cortex.
