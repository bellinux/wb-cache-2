25|$|A geocentric {{frame is}} useful for many {{everyday}} activities and most laboratory experiments, but is a less appropriate choice for solar-system mechanics and space travel. While a heliocentric frame is most useful in those cases, galactic and extra-galactic astronomy is <b>easier</b> <b>if</b> the sun is treated as neither stationary nor {{the center of the}} universe, but rotating around the center of our galaxy, and in turn our galaxy is also not at rest in the cosmic background.|$|E
25|$|It {{is easier}} to detect planets around low-mass stars, for two reasons: First, these stars are more {{affected}} by gravitational tug from planets. The second reason is that low-mass main-sequence stars generally rotate relatively slowly. Fast rotation makes spectral-line data less clear because half of the star quickly rotates away from observer's viewpoint while the other half approaches. Detecting planets around more massive stars is <b>easier</b> <b>if</b> the star has left the main sequence, because leaving the main sequence slows down the star's rotation.|$|E
25|$|The unit deploys {{throughout}} the world, {{and both the}} Army and United States government {{have the ability to}} deny the existence of the unit and any of its members to prevent the onset of international incidents. Their uniforms are commonly not standard Army issue, which makes denying their connection with the US Army <b>easier</b> <b>if</b> they are killed or captured. They also carry weapons that are not always standard issue, and the unit's personnel are familiar with weapons from around the world and can make themselves look like military personnel from other organizations. Unit members can and are sometimes also working as protection details for U.S. diplomats on visits overseas, as well as foreign dignitaries and State Department-designated VIPs on U.S. soil, in which cases they are attached to the Diplomatic Security Service and do carry the official DSS Special Agent badge.|$|E

25|$|Rootkits {{employ a}} variety of {{techniques}} to gain control of a system; the type of rootkit influences the choice of attack vector. The most common technique leverages security vulnerabilities to achieve surreptitious privilege escalation. Another approach is to use a Trojan horse, deceiving a computer user into trusting the rootkit's installation program as benignin this case, social engineering convinces a user that the rootkit is beneficial. The installation task is made <b>easier</b> <b>if</b> the principle of least privilege is not applied, since the rootkit then does not have to explicitly request elevated (administrator-level) privileges. Other classes of rootkits can be installed only by someone with physical access to the target system. Some rootkits may also be installed intentionally by the owner of the system or somebody authorized by the owner, e.g. for the purpose of employee monitoring, rendering such subversive techniques unnecessary. The installation of malicious rootkits is commercially driven, with a pay-per-install (PPI) compensation method typical for distribution.|$|E
25|$|The game {{comprises}} {{two main}} areas: Yasogami High School, {{and a number}} of labyrinths. In Yasogami High, the player can converse with characters, heal their party, develop items and equipment, and visit the Velvet Room where they can fuse new Personas. In labyrinths, the player's party explores while fighting enemies and finding treasures. As the player moves within the labyrinths, a map is filled out on the bottom screen, indicating how much of the labyrinth the player has explored; when a floor is fully explored, a treasure chest appears on that floor. The player also edits the map manually, drawing in the location of walls and adding icons representing landmarks, to make return trips <b>easier.</b> <b>If</b> a player does not want to map out the dungeons themselves, they can switch to an auto-mapping mode. The game features two types of enemies: Shadows, which appear randomly, and Fysis Oikein Eidolon (FOE), more challenging enemies that move about on the field as the player moves, which can be avoided with the right planning.|$|E
25|$|Czechoslovakia had an {{interest}} in stabilizing the situation, because the foreign ministry had to resolve problems with Poland and Germany {{and did not want to}} start negotiations before October 15. The Czechoslovak minister of foreign affairs was focused on building new relationships with Germany and Italy to negotiate guarantees for new borders. After the Munich Agreement all political subjects in Slovakia concluded that it is necessary to change the position of Slovakia within the state and declared autonomy (October 6, 1938). The new, autonomous government understood the definition of borders as a priority and the Slovak People's Party requested participation in the negotiations. The central government in Prague was aware that the delegation should be led by a Slovak and considered Milan Hodža or Imrich Karvaš. However, after the creation of an autonomous government, foreign minister František Chvalkovský proposed its representatives – Jozef Tiso or Ferdinand Ďurčanský. Both politicians refused with the justification that the role was in competition with the central government. When it was emphasized that it is mainly the interest of Slovakia, they accepted. Moreover, Jozef Tiso hoped that Hungarian partners would accept concessions <b>easier</b> <b>if</b> they did not negotiate with representatives of the central government. Under the pressure of the threat of internal destabilization of Czechoslovakia because of diverting actions and further radicalization of the situation in Hungary, Czechoslovakia agreed to begin negotiations on October 9.|$|E

To research his role, he watched more Commons debates.|$|E

A new WRC rule for 2007 allowed for Remote Service Zones to be set up away from the main Service Park at Rally HQ. For 15 minutes the cars could be refuelled, re-tyred, and have any necessary maintenance carried out, as long as the parts and tools to do so (except fuel and tyres) were already in the vehicle. For Grönholm this was a major relief. On the previous stage his car had developed an issue with the hydraulic flappy-paddle gearchanges on his steering wheel, which meant he had had to resort to shifting gears manually. The technicians were unsure why or how it had occurred and were hoping that their repairs would last until the car got back to Valence.
