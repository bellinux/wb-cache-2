5|$|In 1945, a B-29 bomber cost $782,000. It cost $32,000 {{to upgrade}} an {{aircraft}} to Silverplate configuration, so {{the total cost}} of a Silverplate bomber was $814,000.

In 1994, proposals were made to remodel and update the structure to meet modern building codes, with an <b>estimated</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> $16million. Work was to include replacing the concrete floors, structural upgrades, and restoring the original light corridors that penetrated all four floors of the building. In March 1995, plans were made to renovate the then-100-year-old structure. The estimated $22-million project was proposed due to the building failing to comply with the city codes for earthquakes and fires.|$|E

Since the ultimate decision is made by regulators, they need to understand the challenges and key issues in estimating a fair and reasonable <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital for energy utilities. The article introduces and discusses the key issues and challenges that regulators have to deal with when <b>estimating</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital. Unfortunately, there is no agreement among academics, regulators, bankers, and other practitioners on how to address the key issues and challenges in determining the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital in emerging economies.

The <b>estimated</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> construction, $182million, was considered too expensive, and the proposal was suspended in 2001.
