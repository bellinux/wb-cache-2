40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the official}} use of international currencies as reserve currency (store of value) and anchor currency (unit of account). Examining the {{role as a}} reserve currency we note that the US dollar is the main reserve currency even if it recorded a decline given the decrease {{of the value of}} the US <b>dollar</b> <b>reserve</b> holdings and the gradual diversification of the currencies used. Since 2010, the euro's share decreased continuously may be due to the Eurozone crisis and the euro's depreciation against the US dollar. Then we show that the US dollar dominates as an anchor currency, though it was temporary abandoned during crisis time, having more than a regional dimension. At the same time, the use of the euro in exchange rate arrangements appears mainly in the regions that have close links with the euro area. Over the last few years, we have witnessed a gentle orientation towards a multimonetary world, especially regarding the use of the international currencies as reserve currency given the diversification of the currencies in which central banks understand to hold international reserves and the increasing share of the nontraditional currencies in total foreign exchange reserves...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, the {{ownership}} of the banking sector in Latin America has changed hands from local shareholders to large foreign banks from Spain and the United States. It is also {{a fact that the}} foreign exchange market in these countries has been segmented through various kinds of restrictions, because the central bank is unable to function as a lender of last resort in a currency other than its own. The standing issue is whether in practice, a parent bank effectively takes the role of such lender of last resort in supporting its subsidiaries overseas. If that were to be the case, the question is if having a significant participation of foreign subsidiaries is a necessary condition for lifting such restrictions. The data on the compliance of domestic and foreign banks with the <b>dollar</b> <b>reserve</b> requirements in Mexico is used to try to address this question. The answer is a qualified yes. When there are weak domestic banks, it seems that subsidiaries fo foreign banks have a better access to funding in foreign exchange, specially in times of stress. However, when compared with strong domestic banks, the evidence suggests that these local entities can do as well or even better than the foreign subsidiaries. ...|$|E
40|$|Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), {{the reserve}} asset {{issued by the}} International Monetary Fund (IMF), have lately reappeared in the news. The G- 20 leaders, at their recent meeting in London, {{endorsed}} a proposal to issue $ 250 billion in SDRs to counteract the financial crisis, while {{the governor of the}} People's Bank of China has called for SDRs to gradually replace the dollar {{at the center of the}} international monetary system, a plan that would be facilitated by allowing countries to convert their <b>dollar</b> <b>reserve</b> holdings into SDRs. John Williamson reviews the history of the IMF's SDRs and provides an overview of these and other proposals that would increase this synthetic currency's role in the international monetary system. The SDR was originally created to resolve a recognized flaw in the structure of the postwar Bretton Woods monetary system, but the eventual breakdown of Bretton Woods and the subsequent evolution of the current dollar-centered system have relegated the SDR mostly to the minor role of serving as a unit of account for the IMF's transactions. Recent proposals would return the SDR to greater prominence and could help to create a financial system that is free from the imbalances that have plagued the world of late. ...|$|E
40|$|The world {{distribution}} of current account balances {{has been steadily}} drifting away from “normality” since 1997. This puzzling development has occurred in parallel with large scale accumulation of official foreign reserve assets in emerging Asia and commodity exporting countries, and a growing role of portfolio flows in financing the US external deficit. The theoretical toolbox {{that was used to}} understand “old puzzles” of international macroeconomics may still be relevant to address these new puzzles, {{to the extent that it}} focuses more specifically on liquidity aspects: uneven supply of liquid assets, borrowing constraints, and externalities related to financial infrastructures that foster market liquidity. The paper discusses how these various features have been introduced in the most recent literature on global imbalances. One aspect that may require further examination is the role of fi nancial market liquidity as a “public good externality”: in the absence of appropriate provision of such a public good in emerging economies, reserve accumulation may be seen as an attempt to import the “public services” benefi ts of holding liquid “risk-free” assets. This may in turn possibly result in a form of “congestion” if US <b>dollar</b> <b>reserve</b> accumulation outpaces the issuance of US Treasuries or equivalent securities. Large reserve holders have thus turned to a wider range of asset classes, including asset-backed securities whose liquidity has all but vanished in the course of recent fi nancial market turbulences. These developments could therefore affect the fi nancing conditions of the US current account deficit, and undermine some of its structural determinants. ...|$|E
50|$|The exact {{situation}} {{varies from}} country to country; for example, those with dollar pegs have greater <b>dollar</b> <b>reserves</b> and those with euro pegs have greater euro reserves. In 2009, Russia's foreign reserves in euro exceed <b>dollar</b> <b>reserves</b> for the first time; Russia held 47.5% (up from 42% in 2008) in euro and 41.5% (down from 47%) in dollar leading the Central Bank of Russia to announce the euro had become the reserve currency of Russia. The usage of the euro is particularly strong in eastern Europe, not surprisingly in those that have joined the EU, with 54.8% of all loans in Bulgaria, and 85.2% in Latvia before Eurozone accession, being issued in euro rather than the local currencies.The following table shows central banks allocated reserves in euros and US dollar.|$|R

40|$|Many {{have argued}} that the major source of the {{existing}} global macroeconomic imbalances are the twin deficits of the United States (US). However, there is still a debate about whether the global imbalances indeed pose a significant threat to the world economy. This matter is settled by arguing that the global imbalances acted as a "handmaiden" to the 2008 financial crisis. One way to reduce global imbalances is to reform the international monetary system and reduce the role of the US dollar as a reserve currency. Robert Triffin was one of those critical of this "exorbitant" privilege granted to the US, which makes it both a system maker and privilege taker. The Triffin Dilemma captures the fundamental instability that underlies the <b>dollar</b> <b>reserve</b> system. However, there are major obstacles to this proposal. Some analysts including Triffin cited the US security umbrella as the primary reason the US and its major allies would want to retain the role of the dollar in global trade and finance despite the underlying inequities in the system. This is related to the imbalance in global governance which is largely US-centric. The imbalance in global governance is also reflected in the dominance of the US financial system brought about by the "first-mover advantage". Because of the inertia brought about by the imbalance in global governance, economic arguments to reform the international monetary system are likely to be trumped by political reality. The paper analyzes whether current efforts in East Asia in terms of financial and monetary cooperation and rebalancing of economic growth could significantly mitigate the adverse impacts of a global system that will still be dominated by the US dollar in the foreseeable future. It also explains why the People`s Republic of China (PRC) is unlikely to make significant unilateral adjustments to reduce global macroeconomic imbalances. reserve currency, fiduciary system, global imbalances, Triffin Dilemma...|$|E
