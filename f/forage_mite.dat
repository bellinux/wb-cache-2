40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) {{was developed}} {{for the detection of}} specific antibodies against crude Psoroptes antigen. The diagnostic sensitivity was 93. 7 % in 191 sheep with clinical signs associated with mange. These animals originated from 29 flocks in which psoroptic mites were detected. All of 59 sheep infested with Psoroptes ovis were seropositive. Additionally, in 49 % of 70 clinically unaffected sheep originating from P. ovis-infested flocks, specific antibodies could be detected, suggesting that asymptomatic infestations can be diagnosed by serology. The specificity of the ELISA was 96. 5 % as determined with 254 sheep originating from 44 flocks without clinical mange. Cross-reactivity in a low range was detected with selected sera of sheep with clinical chorioptic or <b>forage</b> <b>mite</b> infestations. Four sheep seroconverted 2 weeks after experimental P. ovis infestation, i. e. 2 weeks before clinical signs became obvious. After successful doramectin treatment of 14 sheep with naturally acquired P. ovis infestation, the ELISA values declined slowly but remained positive in seven cases beyond 17 weeks.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{literature}} regarding {{the role of}} house dust and <b>forage</b> <b>mite</b> allergens in canine atopic dermatitis. The presence of immunoglobulin E (IgE) to these mites, especially to Dermatophagoides farinae, is common in both normal and atopic dogs. Exposure of dogs to the different mites is described both in the direct environment and in the coat of animals for house dust mites and in the food for forage mites. Allergens causing allergic disease in dogs seem {{to be different from}} those in humans. Dogs seem to react to high molecular weight allergens, compared to the low molecular weight group 1 and group 2 proteases that are commonly implicated in humans with atopic diseases. Despite numerous published studies dealing with this subject, a number of questions still need to be addressed to better understand the exact role of these mites in the pathogenesis of canine atopic dermatitis and {{to improve the quality of}} the allergens used in practice.

Honey bees are arguably the world's most iconic pollinator. The presence of honey bees in our landscapes has long invoked images of vitality, diligence, and cooperation. Unfortunately, {{the current state}} of honey bee health and productivity paints a rather different picture for this beneficial insect. The survival of honey bees, as well as the livelihoods of those who benefit from their labor (e. g., beekeepers, growers, and ranchers) is under threat from the culmination of a number of detractors to bee health. Exposure to pesticides, poor <b>forage,</b> <b>mite</b> parasites, and pathogens has resulted in heavy annual death of honey bee colonies in the U. S., Europe, {{and other parts of the}} world. Among the suspects thought to contribute to bee decline, the fungal pathogen, Nosema ceranae, is found at high prevalence in both healthy and declining/dead colonies. Since N. ceranae is thought to be a novel pathogen of the European honey bee, Apis mellifera, much remains unknown about its pathology at the individual and colony levels, as well as how infection may interact to form synergisms with other factors thought to be responsible for declining honey bee populations. Here, I review the breadth of research conducted on Nosema infection of honey bees in general. I give particular attention to observations on the detection of infection, cytopathology, viability and infectivity of spores, and incidence and geographic distribution. I rely on what is known about a similar and long-recognized pathogen of A. mellifera, N. apis, for context on the host-parasite relationship of Nosema infection of honey bees. As one part of my dissertation research, I applied background information about the effects of infection on the different castes to show how this may disrupt the social structure of a honey bee colony and contribute to its decline. The level of a honey bee colony or even a whole bee are complicated systems to study intracellular microbes such as Nosema that threaten honey bee health and productivity. Continuous cell lines have been lacking to further our understanding of the pathogenicity of Nosema infection in a simplified environment removed from the confounding effects of other factors such as poor nutrition or pesticides. For the second part of my dissertation research, I addressed this deficiency in honey bee research by developing an in vitro system derived from host cells that could be utilized for observing infection in a simplified environment. Whenever possible, I provide suggestions for future research that could broaden our understanding of this pathogen and ultimately improve honey bee health...|$|E
25|$|To {{the untrained}} eye, these mites are {{generally}} not a very noticeable problem for a strongly growing hive- as the bees may appear strong in number, and may even be very effective at <b>foraging.</b> However, the <b>mite</b> reproduction cycle occurs inside the capped pupae, and the mite population can surge {{as a result of}} colony growth. Careful observation of a colony can help identify signs of disease often spread by mites. When the hive population growth is reduced in preparation for winter or due to poor late summer <b>forage,</b> the <b>mite</b> population growth can overtake that of the bees and can then destroy the hive. It has been observed diseased colonies my slowly die off and be unable to survive through winter even when adequate food stores are present. Often a colony will simply abscond (leave as in a swarm, but leaving no population behind) under such conditions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Learning {{processes}} can be broadly categorized into associative and non-associative. Associative learning occurs {{through the}} pairing of two previously unrelated stimuli, whereas non-associative learning occurs {{in response to}} a single stimulus. How these two principal processes compare in the same learning task and how they contribute to the overall behavioural changes brought about by experience is poorly understood. We tackled this issue by scrutinizing associative and non-associative learning of prey, Western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis, by the predatory mite, Neoseiulus californicus. We compared the behaviour of thrips-experienced and -na predators, which, early in life, were exposed to either thrips with feeding (associative learning), thrips without feeding (non-associative learning), thrips traces on the surface (non-associative learning), spider mites with feeding (thrips-na) or spider mite traces on the surface (thrips-na). Results Thrips experience in early life, no matter whether associative or not, resulted in higher predation rates on thrips by adult females. In the no-choice experiment, associative thrips experience increased the predation rate on the first day, but shortened the longevity of food-stressed predators, a cost of learning. In the choice experiment, thrips experience, no matter whether associative or not, increased egg production, an adaptive benefit of learning. Conclusions Our study shows that both non-associative and associative learning forms operate in <b>foraging</b> predatory <b>mites,</b> N. californicus. The non-rewarded thrips prey experience produced a slightly weaker, but less costly, learning effect than the rewarded experience. We argue that in <b>foraging</b> predatory <b>mites</b> non-associative learning is an inevitable component of associative learning, rather than a separate process...|$|R
40|$|Many {{carnivorous}} arthropods can use chemical {{information from}} plants to locate their herbivorous prey. The composition of blends of herbivore-induced plant volatiles can vary with plant and herbivore species and thus carnivores {{are confronted with}} variable information {{about the presence of}} their prey. Such environmental variation is expected to favour learning. We investigated the learning ability of the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis, a specialized natural enemy of polyphagous spider mites. We reared mites on different plant species, and subsequently tested their preference for volatiles from lima bean plants infested with either the prey herbivore Tetranychus urticae or the nonprey caterpillar Spodoptera exigua in a Y-tube olfactometer. Predators reared on lima bean preferred the volatiles induced by T. urticae, whereas predators reared on cucumber did not. We also investigated the <b>foraging</b> behaviour of <b>mites</b> after a nonrewarding experience during the adult phase (i. e. food deprivation in the presence of S. exigua-induced volatiles from lima bean) or after a rewarding experience (i. e. feeding in the presence of T. urticae-induced volatiles). The rewarding experience had a much larger impact on the <b>foraging</b> responses. Predatory <b>mites</b> with multiple experiences (i. e. a nonrewarding experience followed by a rewarding experience) had the strongest preference for T. urticae-induced versus S. exigua-induced volatiles. We conclude that these learning abilities enable the predatory <b>mites</b> to <b>forage</b> in an environment where their prey can feed on a different plant species than the one on which the predator developed, and where nonprey caterpillars are also presen...|$|R
40|$|Solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) {{radiation}} is deleterious to plant-dwelling mites. Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) is a predominant predator of agriculturally important pest species of spider mite. However, phytoseiid mites {{are more vulnerable}} to UVB radiation than spider mites. Thus, the UVB radiation may influence decision making in <b>foraging</b> phytoseiid <b>mites</b> whether disperse or not. We tested the difference in impact and behavioral response among wavelengths of monochromatic UV radiation using a spectroscopic light source in N. californicus in the laboratory. We also examined whether the behavioral responses of N. californicus females to UV radiation varied based {{on the presence of}} prey (Tetranychus urticae Koch) eggs and residues (webs and excreta of T. urticae: foraging cue). The impact of UV radiation on the N. californicus egg hatchability varied drastically between wavelengths of ≤ 300 nm (0 %) and ≥ 310 nm (100 %). The N. californicus females escaped from UV radiation more quickly when they were irradiated with UV at shorter wavelength. Presence of T. urticae eggs had no effects arresting the escape of phytoseiid mites. In contrast, prey residues (including eggs) markedly detained N. californicus females from escaping under UV irradiation at ≥ 310 nm. However, N. californicus females quickly escaped when irradiated with UV at harmful 300 nm wavelength, regardless of prey cues. This indicates that the eyeless phytoseiid mite is capable of perceiving UV radiation, and whether escape or not is determined on the basis of harmful/harmless UV wavelength and presence/absence of foraging cues...|$|R
40|$|Little {{has been}} done to compare the {{relative}} importance of various mechanisms through which prey assess the potential risk from natural enemies. We used predator-naive spider mites (Tetranychus urticae, Tetranychidae) to (1) compare the responses of prey to chemical cues from enemy and non-enemy species and (2) investigate the source of these cues. In the laboratory, we observed the distribution of T. urticae in response to cues from nine mite species, including (1) predators of spider mites, (2) predators/parasites of other animals, and (3) fungivores/pollen-feeders. When given a choice over 24 h, spider <b>mites</b> <b>foraged</b> and oviposited in fewer numbers on leaf discs that were previously exposed to predatory or parasitic mites (including species incapable of attacking spider mites) than on clean leaf discs (unexposed to mites). Interestingly, previous exposure of leaf arenas to fungivores and pollen-feeders had no significant effect on spider mite distribution. We then observed the response of T. urticae to cues from two species of predator that had been reared on a diet of either spider mites or pollen. T. urticae showed stronger avoidance of leaf discs that were previously exposed to spider-mite-fed predators than of discs exposed to pollen-fed predators. Nevertheless, for one predator species (Amblyseius andersoni), T. urticae still preferred to forage and oviposit on clean (unexposed) discs than on discs exposed to pollen-fed predators. Protein-derived metabolic wastes of predatory or parasitic mites may provide a general cue about potential predation risk for T. urticae. However, T. urticae also avoided areas exposed to pollen-fed predators, suggesting there may be other sources of enemy recognition by the spider mites. We discuss the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that may influence the scope of information through which animals assess predation risk...|$|R
