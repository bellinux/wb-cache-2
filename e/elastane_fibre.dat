40|$|The {{woven fabrics}} {{structural}} mobility has some {{influence on the}} garment design and pattern construction. Deformation peculiarities during six textile fabrics extension were analysed in this work. Four of the tested fabrics had the elastane filaments in their structure. The method of parallelepiped shaped specimen uniaxial extension till fixed strain was used. The experiment was carrying out using a "Tinius Olsen HT 10 " tension machine. The specimens' deformation exceeds 14  %. The parallelepiped shape of specimen's was received by cut of its top and bottom edges with pitch of 16 degrees. The woven fabrics structure mobility was analyzed using strain-stress curves, numerical and graphical results. The results of this research work have shown that deformation peculiarities of the woven fabrics depend on their structural characteristics: density, thickness, wave and presence of elastane filaments. Taking into account the more considerable extensibility of <b>elastane</b> <b>fibre</b> the shearing phenomenon was not occurred finally during specimens' deformations. The results indicated that for the tested fabrics deformation till stated degree the force from 0. 6  N till 9. 4  N is necessary. [URL] </p...|$|E
5000|$|There are {{multiple}} patented technologies that concern hybrid grass, {{such as the}} following examples: SISGrass, developed by SIS Pitches, uses a specific technology to inject polyethylene fibres into the soil, AirFibr, a technology developed by Natural Grass, which uses natural cork as the softness element, and Fibrelastic, developed by Mansfield Sand, which uses <b>elastane</b> <b>fibres</b> as the softness element. and GrassMaster, developed by Desso, obtained a patent on hybrid grass system based on injected fibres.|$|R
