5|$|Monteverdi wrote six {{acknowledged}} operas for the Mantua court, {{of which}} only L'Orfeo survives with libretto and music intact. Four {{of the five}} lost Mantuan works were written after the composer had left {{the service of the}} Gonzagas in 1612 and was <b>ensconced</b> <b>in</b> Venice, but still retained contacts with Mantua. L'Arianna and Andromeda were completed and performed; the others were all abandoned incomplete.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} Beatles' flight to America Epstein was offered {{numerous}} samples of products by merchandisers who required a licence {{to be allowed}} to sell them such as clocks, pens, plastic wigs, bracelets, and games. Epstein rejected all of them; directing the merchandisers to Byrne instead, who was already in New York <b>ensconced</b> <b>in</b> The Drake Hotel on Park Avenue at 56th Street. Byrne rented expensive offices on Fifth Avenue, hiring two limousines (on 24-hour standby) and a helicopter to fly clients to and from the airport, insisting that only the presidents of merchandising companies were allowed to talk directly with him, or with his partner, Lord Eliot, who helped to promote the company name with use of his title. Eliot would later recall going to the Seltaeb office {{once or twice a week}} to draw $1,000 from petty cash.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} Beatles' {{trip to the}} United States, merchandisers pitched many {{products}} to Epstein, including Beatles clocks, pens, cigarette lighters, plastic wigs, bracelets, games, etc., but he rejected them all. This was because he had already allowed David Jacobs, the lawyer for NEMS, to give away 90 per cent of merchandising rights to one Nicky Byrne, in the UK. This was later deemed to be a disastrous mistake, as it left only 10 per cent for Epstein, NEMS and the Beatles. Byrne then took over Epstein's Stramsact merchandising in the UK and set up Seltaeb (Beatles spelled backwards), in the United States. While the Beatles were <b>ensconced</b> <b>in</b> the Plaza Hotel in New York, Epstein was further besieged by calls and visits from promoters, retailers, television commentators and hustlers.|$|E

5|$|Roger Mortimer, Isabella, and thirteen-year-old Prince Edward, {{accompanied}} by King Edward's half-brother Edmund of Woodstock, landed in Orwell on 24 September {{with a small}} force of men and met with no resistance. Instead, enemies of the Despensers moved rapidly to join them, including Edward's other half-brother, Thomas of Brotherton; Henry of Lancaster, who had inherited the earldom from his brother Thomas; {{and a range of}} senior clergy. <b>Ensconced</b> <b>in</b> the residence halls of the fortified and secure Tower of London, Edward attempted to garner support from within the capital. The city of London rose against his government, and on 2 October the King left London, taking the Despensers with him. London descended into anarchy, as mobs attacked Edward's remaining officials and associates, killing his former treasurer Walter Stapledon in St Paul's Cathedral, and taking the Tower and releasing the prisoners inside.|$|E
5|$|The Didact and his {{makeshift}} crew {{travel to}} an ancient Precursor planet, Charum Hakkor, where humans had once also settled. The Didact is disturbed to find {{that many of the}} Precursor structures on the planet have fallen into ruin; Precursor structures were thought to be completely indestructible. The Didact also discovers that a prisoner, <b>ensconced</b> <b>in</b> both Precursor and human containment methods, has escaped. They travel to the nearby planet of Faun Hakkor, another formerly human-settled world, to find it stripped of all sentient life, its ecosystem in peril. The Didact sponsors Bornstellar's first mutation, a vital part of Forerunner growth, imprinting himself upon Bornstellar. The Didact's memories, tactics and experiences are shared with Bornstellar, giving him insight into the context of the Forerunner-human war and the planets the crew had just visited.|$|E
5|$|For testing purposes, a {{new engine}} {{consisting}} of six Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engines blowing across the outer rim of an impeller was designed {{under the name}} PV-704, PV stood for Private Venture. The PV-704 was a stop-gap design built into a bunker-like building behind the Avro Experimental Test facility. It was intended to test various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with test data to show {{the viability of the}} concept. The original plan to initially test the Viper Engine Rig was to have continued into free flight testing. Unfortunately, testing was anything but smooth; the test model suffered from hazardous oil leaks, resulting in three fires. It eventually got to the point that staff were afraid of the machine, even when safely <b>ensconced</b> <b>in</b> a booth constructed of bullet-proof glass and quarter-inch-thick steel. A final, disastrous and nearly lethal engine test in 1956 which involved a Viper jet engine running wild, convinced Frost that a less dangerous test vehicle was necessary.|$|E

50|$|After {{the details}} of her {{involvement}} with Hanna became known to the public, Brown <b>ensconced</b> herself <b>in</b> staunch republican areas of north and west Belfast. According to Devenport, she became romantically involved with IRA associate Davy Adams during this period.|$|R
5|$|In June 1944, Eichelberger {{was summoned}} to Sixth Army {{headquarters}} by Krueger. The Battle of Biak, where the 41st Infantry Division had landed in May, was going badly, and the airfields that MacArthur had promised {{would be available to}} support the Battle of Saipan were not in American hands. Eichelberger found that the Japanese, who were present in larger numbers than originally reported, were <b>ensconced</b> <b>in</b> caves overlooking the airfield sites. While the Americans were better trained and equipped than at Buna, so too were the Japanese, who employed their new tactics of avoiding costly counterattacks and exacting the maximum toll for ground gained. After seeing the situation for himself, Eichelberger concluded that Fuller's 41st Infantry Division had not done too badly. Nonetheless, as at Buna, Eichelberger relieved a number of officers that he felt were not performing as the battle ground on. His orders were to supersede Fuller as task force commander rather than relieve him as division commander, but Fuller requested his own relief, and Krueger obliged him. On Eichelberger's recommendation, Fuller was replaced by Brigadier General Jens A. Doe. Krueger was unimpressed with Eichelberger's performance on Biak, concluding that Eichelberger's tactics were unimaginative, and no better than Fuller's, and may have delayed rather than expedited the capture of the island. On the other hand, MacArthur thought sufficiently highly of Eichelberger's performance to award him the Silver Star.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the Kansas Pacific Railroad laid its tracks west through Manhattan in 1866, the 11-year-old {{settlement}} was permanently <b>ensconced</b> <b>in</b> the tallgrass prairie. Manhattan's population has grown every decade since its founding.|$|E
25|$|Hobhouse died in Kensington in 1926. Her ashes were <b>ensconced</b> <b>in</b> a {{niche in}} the National Women's Monument at Bloemfontein, where she was {{regarded}} as a heroine. Her death went unreported in the Cornish press.|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{death is}} a release; for his last days have been very frightful. Your coming, Dr Thorne, will be a comfort to Lady Scatcherd."

25|$|Results still {{proved to}} be {{inconsistent}} however, with the New Year seeing Everton firmly <b>ensconced</b> <b>in</b> mid-table, although the Capital One Cup provided some solace, as the club reached the semi-finals where they would meet Manchester City; unfortunately, they would fall here. In the January window, Everton purchased striker Oumar Niasse from Lokomotiv Moscow for £13.5 million.|$|E
25|$|By 1873 {{the club}} was <b>ensconced</b> <b>in</b> plush {{quarters}} {{at the foot of}} Joseph Campau Street, the easternmost end of Detroit, and had become the center of all water sports. A half-dozen new clubs formed nearby, and most displayed their sailing and rowing trophies at Bidigaire's saloon up Joseph Campau. The Biddle House on East Jefferson and the Russell House, also attracted a thirsty boating set.|$|E
60|$|Words cannot {{express the}} offence thus given to Janet. Something swelled {{in her throat}} as if to suffocate her, but {{there could be no}} reply, and to burst out crying would only make him think her younger still; so as he turned to his mournful task, she <b>ensconced</b> herself <b>in</b> a high-backed chair, and watched him from under her dark brows.|$|R

Brackenbury paused under some trees, and {{as he did so}} he caught sight of a hansom cabman making him a sign that he was disengaged. The circumstance fell in so happily to the occasion that he at once raised his cane in answer, and had soon <b>ensconced</b> himself <b>in</b> the London gondola.|$|R
25|$|On {{the batting}} side, there were perhaps fewer stars {{than on the}} earlier tours, with Roger Blunt retired and Stewie Dempster captaining Leicestershire. In bowling too, Bill Merritt, the leading wicket-taker of the two {{previous}} visits, was now playing in the Lancashire League, and would then qualify for Northamptonshire, where the star wicketkeeper of 1927 and 1931, Ken James, was already <b>ensconced</b> <b>in</b> the side.|$|E
25|$|The five {{corporations}} {{listed in}} the indictments were Confidential Inc., Whisper Inc., Publishers Distributing Corp. of New York, Kable Publishing Inc. of Illinois and Hollywood Research Inc. of Los Angeles.

Illinois also refused {{to cooperate with the}} Attorney General. Brown eventually put Marjorie and Fred Meade on trial.|$|E
25|$|Lever Brothers {{had indeed}} been seriously damaged by the press, {{as well as by}} rises in the costs of raw materials, but Lever hesitated to use the court awarded cash to bolster the company.

His time travel occurs at desperate times in his life; he re-lives events past and future and becomes fatalistic (though not a defeatist) because he has seen when, how and why he will die.|$|E
25|$|Leith's men pushed {{along the}} walls toward the lesser breach where they {{assisted}} the Portuguese in breaking through. Still undefeated, Rey led his men in a house-to-house battle that finally ended {{when he and his}} remaining 1,300 troops took refuge in the La Mota Castle. Meanwhile, the Allied troops went berserk and sacked the city for three days in which the place was virtually destroyed. <b>Ensconced</b> <b>in</b> his hilltop castle, Rey held out against a 60-gun bombardment until 8 September when he finally ran up the white flag. Before being forced to surrender the survivors of his garrison, his soldiers inflicted over 5,000 casualties on their enemies, including Leith who was wounded.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategic}} withdrawal {{was completed}} on 8 October, though Prince William of Gloucester, retreating from Hoorn, fought a rearguard action against Daendels {{in the following}} days. By mid-October, the situation of before 19 September had been restored, the Anglo-Russians <b>ensconced</b> <b>in</b> their natural redoubt and the Franco-Batavians besieging them. The weather had taken {{a turn for the}} worse, and early winter gales made provisioning by sea difficult. The Duke of York was now {{faced with the prospect of}} a winter siege in a situation in which his troops might well face starvation (on 13 October provisions for only eleven days were still available). He therefore decided to approach Brune with a proposal for an honourable capitulation transmitted by general Knox on 14 October.|$|E
50|$|A {{period of}} intense civil unrest ensued, {{during which the}} members of the Committees of Public Safety and General Security were forced to seek refuge in the Convention.

50|$|The Ute tribe, <b>ensconced</b> protectively <b>in</b> Colorado's Rocky Mountains, {{were among}} the last {{remaining}} Native American horse nomads. In the centuries since their arrival in the Americas, horses had become so crucial to the Utes' survival that they had gained a sort of totemic significance among the Utes. As a federal Indian agent, Nathan Meeker embarked upon a program to replace the Ute lifestyle of hunting bison from horseback with plowshares and seeds.|$|R
