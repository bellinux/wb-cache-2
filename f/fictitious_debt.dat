5000|$|It was {{claimed that}} the [...] "victim" [...] company - the Tomskneft oil company - has not filed any {{complaint}} and says, on the contrary, that it has suffered no such fraud.An article A Vicious Sentence by Mikhail Fishman, in Kommersant-Vlast in 2006 claimed: [...] "This concerns the assets of Tomskneft-VNK, taken over by YUKOS. The management of VNK resisted the takeover; it used a technique that was widespread in the late 1990s - making up a <b>fictitious</b> <b>debt</b> for the company, so that VNK appeared to owe somebody $440 million. All the same, YUKOS succeeded in acquiring the controlling interest. It refused to pay the <b>fictitious</b> <b>debt,</b> and transferred the assets of VNK enterprises to offshore zones. When the state, a minority shareholder in VNK, called on YUKOS {{to account for the}} transfer, YUKOS explained that it was a safeguard against attacks on the company by the fictitious creditors. All the enterprises in question were returned to VNK ownership almost a year before the auction at which YUKOS bought out the state's remaining stake in the company - at a fair market price, as the state later acknowledged."Nevertheless, Tomskneft (contrary to its wishes and to common sense) has been declared a victim, the temporary transfer of assets has been defined as theft, and the lawyer who carried out the orders of the company's real owners has been identified as the mastermind of the operation." ...|$|E
50|$|In July 2014, the SLC {{was accused}} of using {{controversial}} tactics akin {{to those of the}} payday loans company Wonga after it was discovered that it had been sending out letters from what appeared to be an independent debt collection agency called Smith Lawson & Company. (In June 2014, Wonga had been ordered to pay £2.6 million in compensation for sending customers letters from <b>fictitious</b> <b>debt</b> recovery firms.). The SLC announced it was suspending the use of the letters, which it said had used the “secondary brand” (which small print {{at the bottom of the}} letters indicated was a trading name of the Student Loans Company) to avoid paying fees to a conventional debt collection agency.|$|E
60|$|On these grounds I do {{not blame}} the {{arrangement}} {{this day in}} question, as a preference given to the debt of individuals over the Company's debt. In my eye {{it is no more}} than the preference of a fiction over a chimera; but I blame the preference given to those <b>fictitious</b> private <b>debts</b> over the standing defence and the standing government. It is there the public is robbed. It is robbed in its army; it is robbed in its civil administration; it is robbed in its credit; it is robbed in its investment, which forms the commercial connection between that country and Europe. There is the robbery.|$|R
50|$|During {{the course}} of the 18th and 19th centuries the law of contract, the law of tort and the law of trusts emerged as {{discrete}} bodies of law within English private law. As many thought they covered the field, restitutionary claims as embodied in the common money counts were appended to the law of contract. The various claims were termed 'quasi-contractual'. This was because it was often necessary to plead that the defendant had promised to repay a debt, even though the promise was <b>fictitious</b> and the <b>debt</b> was imposed by the law. While restitutionary obligations were not enforced solely through these quasi-contractual claims, the law of quasi-contract constitutes the core of the modern law of unjust enrichment. A seminal case is Moses v Macferlan (1760) 2 Burr 1005.|$|R
40|$|European Union admits {{its lack}} of innovativeness. This holds even more of its ten new member-states from the Central and Eastern Europe, {{including}} Slovenia. Her {{economic and social development}} reasons for her lack of innovativeness can be summarized in a history of culture preferring (exaggerated) solidarity to entrepreneurship. It is centuries long. The attempt to create entrepreneurship by import of investors with written-off equipment in Kingdom of Yugoslavia times lacked time to demonstrate its success in 1930 s. Kingdom experienced a fictitious democracy. In the same period the liberalistic economy led to the big depression. Hitler won - with no democracy - all the wars against countries with democracy, in 1930 s. Yugoslavia, including Slovenia, was heavily destroyed in WWII, as well as lost most of the remaining entrepreneurs. In a synergy of all these reasons, people accepted solidarity and accelerated industrialization under Tito. Lack of systems thinking and innovation helped country succeed on a <b>fictitious</b> basis: international <b>debts</b> financed Yugoslavs’ living. This could not last. Slovenia went independent and supported innovation legally enough to enter European Union, but less so in real culture and economy. Thus, the so-called transition is not one from socialism to capitalism, but a more natural one - from pre-industrial via the early industrialization to the industrial era. Move to postindustrial era as the one of an innovative society is the next step. It is delayed a lot and causes danger of neocolonial exploitation.
