In November 2013, RZA gave an update on the album, saying: [...] "I got optimism off the summer tour we did in Europe. It was so healthy. We got a lot of time on the bus to talk, to argue, to laugh, to hug, to see fans loving us. And to see the potential of what we can do. To see the potential of the legacy of what we did.

[...] In November 2013, Method Man stated that Raekwon had not worked on the album at all, and Ghostface had only recorded two songs for the album so far.

It was reported that the alteration was made ahead of a possible return of the Superbike World Championship in 2015 after series officials raised concerns about the lack of run-off areas on the circuit. The change was heavily criticised by the sport's fan base on social media and certain drivers who felt it removed part of the challenge from Parabolica. The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile race director Charlie Whiting, however, defended the changes, revealing that drivers and the sport's governing body asked for alterations to be made for safety reasons but acknowledged the turn may not provide much of a challenge as it previously did. Others, including Romain Grosjean joined in Whiting's defence, with the Lotus driver believing the gravel trap's removal would enable drivers to find their limit more quickly because of the lack of fear of a large accident in the event of problems.|$|E

We’re {{going to get this}} settled once and for all Wednsday night. I’m going to get Mom in a nice quiet bar and start talkin’. I know she’ll say it’s o. k., {{especially}} with a few Old Fashion’s under her belt. But what about your mother now, honey? Are you sure she still feels the same? Aren’t parents a nuisance? Gosh weren’t they young once? Honey, I love you so much. You looked terrific Sunday. When I’m with you I just can’t take my eyes off you, darling. When you’re near me I can’t talk or think straight.

Wednsday [sic] morning about two o’clock I {{woke up with}} a terrific stomach ache and nausia [sic]. I had diarrehea [sic] {{for the rest of}} the night and that morning I went on sick call. It seems that I had a little fever so they slapped me in the hospital, so here I am. I feel swell now though, my fever is gone and I’m getting a good rest, the first I’ve had in nine months. I’m burned up though, I was {{supposed}} to solo this Saturday, now I probably won’t unless I can get out of this meat house real soon. Don’t worry honey, it’s nothing serious just that touchy stomach of mine. I think it’s a touch of tomaine [sic] poisoning. They ought to let me out tomorrow. They better I’ve <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> to do, what with a final exam in airplanes coming up. Did you like “Pin-Up Girl?” I haven’t seen it as yet. It’s supposed to be pretty good. I just talked to one of the “medics” here, he said that I’ll probably leave the hosp. tomorrow. It was just a plain case of the “G. I. ’s” from dirty silverware, or a gem I picked up. My temperature is normal and everything is coming out O. K., if you know what I mean. Ed Conway, my buddy, is having some trouble with his flying. He doesn’t think he’ll ever solo. Poor guy. He changed instructors and now has Mr. Balko, my instructor, but it doesn’t seem to help. Already three have been washed from my class, but that’s only the beginning. Please excuse this worse than usual writing honey, but I’m in bed and trying vainly to balance a pad on my knees. That sure sounds like a soft set-up Gardener has. Some guys get all the breaks, with a little brown nosing, I guess. Well honey, I’ve got to shave and clean up a bit. I love you, and still miss you. Give my love to Bob and tell her to take care of herself. I’ll bet she looks like something. Hope it’s a girl. Your Loving Son Judd [Transcription ends...|$|E
