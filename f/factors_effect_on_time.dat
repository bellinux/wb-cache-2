40|$|AbstractThe {{construction}} projects involve various risk factors which have various impacts on time objective {{that may lead}} to time-overrun. This study suggests and applies a new technique for minimizing risk <b>factors</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>time</b> using lean construction principles. The lean construction is implemented in this study using the last planner system through execution of an industrial project in Egypt. Evaluating the effect of using the new tool is described in terms of two measurements: Percent Expected Time-overrun (PET) and Percent Plan Completed (PPC). The most important risk factors are identified and assessed, while PET is quantified at the project start and during the project execution using a model for time-overrun quantification. The results showed that total project time is reduced by 15. 57 % due to decreasing PET values, while PPC values improved. This is due to minimizing and mitigating the effect of most of the risk factors in this project due to implementing lean construction techniques. The results proved that the quantification model is suitable for evaluating the effect of using lean construction techniques. In addition, the results showed that average value of PET due to factors affected by lean techniques represents 67 % from PET values due to all minimized risk factors...|$|E
