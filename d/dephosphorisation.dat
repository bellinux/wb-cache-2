The feedstock at the Domnarvet works had a phosphorus content of 1.8-2.0% and so the process was developed with one aim being <b>dephosphorisation.</b> The first production unit was installed in 1954 at Domnarvet Jernverk.|$|E
5000|$|The {{metal in}} the ladle is sent {{directly}} for {{basic oxygen steelmaking}} or to a pretreatment stage. High purity oxygen at a pressure of [...] is introduced at supersonic speed {{onto the surface of}} the iron bath through a water-cooled lance, which is suspended in the vessel and kept a few feet above the bath. Pretreatment of the blast furnace hot metal is done externally to reduce sulphur, silicon, and phosphorus before charging the hot metal into the converter. In external desulphurising pretreatment, a lance is lowered into the molten iron in the ladle and several hundred kilograms of powdered magnesium are added and the sulphur impurities are reduced to magnesium sulphide in a violent exothermic reaction. The sulfide is then raked off. Similar pretreatments are possible for external desiliconisation and external <b>dephosphorisation</b> using mill scale (iron oxide) and lime as fluxes. The decision to pretreat depends {{on the quality of the}} hot metal and the required final quality of the steel.|$|E

IMCT-L-P and IMCT-CPO 43 - models, have been developed by coupling with the developed thermodynamic model for calculating the mass action concentrations N-i of structural units or ion couples in the slags, i. e. the IMCT-N-i model, based on the IMCT. The developed IMCT-L-P and IMCT-CPO 43 - models have been verified with the experimental results from the literature and the predicted results by the summarised five L-P models and three CPO 43 - models.

The comprehensive effect of CaO + FetO, which can be described by the mass action concentration ratio N-FetO/N-CaO, controls <b>dephosphorisation</b> ability and potential of the slags. An exponentially growing relationship of lg L-P against slag oxidisation ability and slag basicity as the simplified complex basicity (% CaO) /[(%P 2 O 5) + (% Al 2 O 3) ] or optical basicity can be established for the slags in a temperature range from 1811 to 1927 K. However, a linearly increasing relationship of lg CPO 43 - against slag oxidisation ability and the aforementioned two kinds of slag basicity can be correlated for the slags in the lower temperature range from 1811 to 1828 K and the middle temperature range from 1870 to 1876 K; an inversely asymmetrical U type relationship of lg CPO 43 - against the aforementioned parameters can be observed for the slags in the higher temperature range from 1918 to 1927 K.

The developed IMCT-C-PO(4) 3 - model has been verified to be valid through comparing with the measured and the predicted ones by four reported C-PO(4) 3 - models from the literature. Besides the total phosphate capacity C-PO(4) 3 -, the respective phosphate capacity C-PO(4) 3 -, i of nine <b>dephosphorisation</b> products as P 2 O 5, 3 FeO center dot P 2 O 5, 4 FeO center dot P 2 O 5, 2 CaO center dot P 2 O 5, 3 CaO center dot P 2 O 5, 4 CaO center dot P 2 O 5, 2 MgO center dot P 2 O 5, 3 MgO center dot P 2 O 5 and 3 MnO center dot P 2 O 5 can also be accurately predicted by the developed IMCT-C-PO(4) 3 - model. The formed 3 CaO center dot P 2 O 5 accounts for 99. 20 % of <b>dephosphorisation</b> products comparing with the generated 4 CaO center dot P 2 O 5 for 0. 80 %.

40|$|Phosphorus is {{generally}} undesirable in steel. Decreasing availability of low phosphorus iron ores {{and the desire}} to recycle waste materials like basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS) slags is driving renewed interest in phosphorus removal. A number of phosphorus partition (LP) equations have been proposed in the literature for specific slag compositions and temperature ranges at equilibrium. These LP equations have been evaluated against the historic data on the phosphorus removal from an industrial top blown bottom stirred basic oxygen convertor. Further, the performance of these partition equations has been used to inform {{the development of a new}} LP model more suitable to the prevailing conditions in the Australian steelmaking industry. The new model has been used to isolate the key factors controlling <b>dephosphorisation,</b> namely lower temperature, higher basicity and higher oxygen potential. This LP model has allowed secondary factors influencing <b>dephosphorisation</b> to be assessed, including TiOx load, heat duration and stirring rate...|$|E
40|$|In a tough {{economic}} climate and faced with increasing environmental awareness, Japanese steel makers developed {{a number of}} processes in the early 1980 s to desiliconise and dephosphorise hot metal prior to decarburisation in the BOF. These processes used both CaO and Na 2 O based slags. <b>Dephosphorisation</b> has not been considered an issue in Australia due to the abundance of low phosphorus ores. The BOF has been capable of removing phosphorus without excessive impact on the productivity of the furnace. However, the availability of low phosphorus ores {{is not something that}} should be taken for granted, particularly, if the ability to use lower grade ores results in a large increase in useful domestic ore reserves. This paper summarises the technologies available for <b>dephosphorisation</b> of hot metal using both CaO and Na 2 O based slags. It can be seen that a reduction of in the phosphorus concentration of hot metal below 0. 010 % can be achieved prior to decarburisation using a relatively simple process and resulting in significant cost savings...|$|E

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} to examine the influence of slag evolution on BOF <b>dephosphorisation.</b> An experimental technique was developed where slag/metal emulsion samples {{were obtained from the}} BOF during processing. The observed evolution of slag composition was consistent with many previous studies, where {{in the first half of}} the blow slags high in (%SiO 2) and low in (%FeO) are generated. During the second half of the oxygen blow, (FeO) generation and lime dissolution improve the slag basicity and contribute to the transfer of phosphorus from metal to slag. Poor levels of phosphorus removal during the centre region of the blow were found to coincide with a minimum in the (%FeO) composition. By the end of blow, 70 % of the mass of phosphorus in the furnace is present in the slag, and the extent of phosphorus removal is proportional to the slag basicity and the (%FeO) concentration in the slag. By utilizing mass balance calculations to estimate the mass of slag in the furnace, it was shown that at tap, approximately 30 % of lime and 50 % of magnesia remain undissolved in a liquid slag saturated in both components. It was concluded that the mass of lime added to the furnace could be reduced without influencing the dissolved concentration of (%CaO), and therefore without deteriorating the extent of <b>dephosphorisation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Production of low {{phosphorus}} steel {{using the}} {{basic oxygen steelmaking}} process is conventionally achieved by maintaining a highly basic slag. This leads to high flux consumption, generates a large volume of slag and restricts recycling of the slag due to presence of free lime. The environmental impact goes further, since the calcined lime involves depletion of a mineral resource, consumption of fossil fuels and release of CO 2. However, recent studies indicate that adequate <b>dephosphorisation</b> is possible in the BOF even if the slag basicity is reduced from the current practice (3. 3 - 3. 6) {{to a level of}} 2. 7 - 2. 8. Phosphorus partitioning deviates considerably from equilibrium and post stirring of bath helps in lowering bath phosphorus. Induction furnace is widely used to produce structural grade steel.

40|$|The oolitic {{iron ore}} {{reserves}} in Lisakovsky, Northwest Kazakhstan represent a quite challenging deposit both from technological and from resource point of view. The difficulties in processing such type of ore are {{connected with the}} extremely fine dissemination of phosphorus and gangue minerals inside the oolitic formations. The goethite crystals are cemented in their structure by aluminosilicates with quartz and other gangue minerals and dissemination is so fine {{that they are not}} separable by physical methods. The laboratory tests performed in direction of <b>dephosphorisation</b> have shown that the combination of alkaline roasting followed by low intensity magnetic separation and acid leaching enables the obtaining of high grade iron concentrate. The magnetic separation performed ahead of leaching has been efficient by means of buffering the high pH via washing out the soluble salts and the excess of bases and applied after leaching has facilitated the removal of secondary liberated gangue minerals in the non-magnetic fraction. As a consequence, phosphorous content has been dropped to a more acceptable for the ferrous metallurgy levels while iron grade and recovery have reached respectively 61. 6 and 80. 8 percent.

40|$|Beneficiation routes {{aimed at}} <b>dephosphorisation</b> of oolitic gravity {{magnetic}} concentrate and involving {{a combination of}} roasting, re-grinding, magnetic separation and water and acid leaching are investigated. Roasting was carried out at 900 ºC for one hour without or with lime or sodium hydroxide as roasting additives. When additives were used, cement phases of Si-Al-Na-Ca-O type were detected {{as well as the}} mineral giuseppettite. During the thermal process sodium silicate is liquefied and the newly formed phases coat the oolites and penetrate inside the cracks. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy analysis has indicated that the zone surrounding the oolites consists of Na, Al and Si phases with part of phosphorus being captured there. As a result of the alkaline roasting, goethite is partly transformed to magnetite and this reduction is reinforced with an increase in sodium hydroxide dosage. Investigation of redistribution of phosphorous shows that it could be only partly separated if leaching is not accompanied by re-grinding and physical separation. The recommended dosage of the reductive agent for the final flowsheet is 8 % mass ratio to concentrate. Grinding to a mean size of 0. 040 mm, with water and acid leaching and double magnetic separation creates conditions to obtain a high-quality iron concentrate with 65. 97 % Fe and recovery of 92. 43 %, with simultaneous decrease in the phosphorus content from 0. 71 % to 0. 05 %.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} effect of sodium {{hydroxide}} and sodium carbonate used as additives during oxidizing roasting of oolitic limonite iron concentrate and more precisely upon the change in its magnetic susceptibility. Further, the efficiency of Alkali Roast Acid Leach (ARAL) technology for <b>dephosphorisation</b> of the concentrate is compared with the case when sodium hydroxide was added in alkali leach after roasting. The treatment without additives in roasting resulted in obtaining iron concentrate with 58 % iron and 0. 21 % phosphorus, while the ARAL approach yielded concentrate with 63 % iron and 0. 09 % phosphorus. The influence of combination of coke as reducing agent and sodium hydroxide in roasting at 900 °C is also investigated and results displayed in 3 D form. The combination of ARAL with reductive roasting, grinding of the clinker to 80 % - 0, 075 mm, flotation of the non-reacted coke and magnetic separation {{before and after the}} acid leach resulted in iron concentrate with 66 % iron and 0. 05 % phosphorus. The study has shown that the application of the ARAL approach with low addition of alkalis followed by 10 to 15 minute acid leaching at ambient temperature could substantially reduce phosphorus, thus offering the possibility for efficient treatment of high phosphorus iron ores.

40|$|Oxygen {{steelmaking}} is {{a mature}} technology with over {{fifty years of}} continuous process development. Over the last twenty years, there have been significant advances in lance technology (e. g. coherent jets), refractories (e. g. C-MgO linings) and process control (e. g. use of cameras to monitor slopping). However, two inter-related challenges have only been partially addressed, namely: a) how to minimise flux additions whilst still providing adequate protection to the refractory lining and meeting the required grade of steel (particularly, in regard to phosphorus); and b) how to lower blowing times without excessive slopping whilst still meeting the required grade of steel and ensuring process stability. These problems are not easily addressed through the traditional static models because by they reflect interrelated issues of a dynamic nature, for example, lowering the lance close to the bath may accelerate decarburisation, lowering the potential blowing time, but this may result in slopping under certain circumstances. Similarly, changing the sequence of flux additions to a furnace may {{reduce the risk of}} slopping but maybe also expose the refractory to attack early during the blow. 'Black box' modelling techniques (i. e. neural networks, fuzzy logic and multi-variate statistics) have been used to address the issues such as these and {{there is some evidence that}} these techniques can help in optimising the operation. These types of approaches tend to be quite specific to the operation being modelled and also rarely provide insight into the underlying physics and chemistry of the process. Several groups around the world have recently attempted to address this shortfall in understanding of Oxygen Steelmaking through the development of 'Grey box' process models i. e. models based on underlying scientific principles but with semi-empirical corrections. At Swinburne University of Technology, we have previously developed a two zone model of Oxygen Steelmaking that is focused on understanding how decarburisation is affected by lance height, blowing rate, flux dissolution and scrap melting. A schematic diagram outlining the basic components of the model are provided in Figure 1. The model has been successfully validated against the industrial results of Cicutti et al. but is limited in its wider application because it doesn't include slag generation, slopping behaviour and <b>dephosphorisation.</b> More recent work at Swinburne has made significant progress in developing models for predicting slag foaming behaviour and droplet generation, with the ultimate goal that these models are incorporated into a general process model of Oxygen Steelmaking...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is aimed}} at {{understanding}} the thermodynamic principles influencing the phosphorus partition between slag and steel during steelmaking, particularly during refining of high-phosphorus hot metal using the basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS) process. Mapping of the slag path {{has been carried out}} using a mass balance model based on input conditions and off-gas analysis, which has been validated by intermediate measurements of slag and metal composition in an industrial basic oxygen furnace (BOF). The slag composition is found to vary over a wide range of basicity (%CaO/%SiO 2) and iron oxide content. The partition of phosphorus increases with progress of refining but reduces during the intermediate period, corresponding to a decrease in iron oxide concentration and formation of “dry slag”. The phosphorus partition ratio increases again {{towards the end of the}} process. The equilibrium partition ratios for such conditions have been theoretically estimated using slag “model(s) ”, based on the estimated slag compositions. It is seen that the partition ratio of phosphorus remains within 45 % – 60 % of the equilibrium value, showing a gradual decrease with progress of the refining process. Equilibrium phosphorus partition ratios for slags containing low concentrations of MnO and Al 2 O 3 have been experimentally determined, over the ranges of basicity and iron oxide concentration approximately corresponding to that observed in the typical BOS process. It is seen that the equilibrium phosphorus partition ratio is practically independent of basicity greater than 2. 5 – 2. 6, over the entire range of temperature and FeOx concentration studied. Variation of the activity of P 2 O 5 with basicity and FeOx concentration has been investigated to explain the trends observed in the variation of phosphorus partition ratio. It is seen that the activity coefficient of P 2 O 5 is lowest, and hence most conducive for removal of phosphorus from steel, over certain finite ranges of basicity and iron oxide concentration. It follows that the efficiency of <b>dephosphorisation</b> is likely to be maximum if the basic oxygen steelmaking process is operated within these ranges. Simultaneous with this work, mathematical correlations have been developed for estimation of P 2 O 5 activity coefficient and phosphorus partition ratio as functions of slag composition. The correlations are compared with those proposed by earlier workers and are found to result in better predictions over certain composition ranges. QC 2010062...|$|E
