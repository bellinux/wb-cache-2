Stephen Harmison, England's out of form fast bowler, performed well, but could still not take a wicket and was upstaged by Plunkett.|$|E

25|$|Polish army of {{that period}} {{consisted}} - as before - of knights, burghers, and peasants, with obvious division of labor and specialization: cavalry, infantry, and fortified cities defenders. The knight, along with his lance belonged to his own chorągiew (or rota) of land, clan, or mercenary, and the best warriors were called to lead the chorągiews of the army. Szlachta of moderate means, able to arm and support the lance, enlisted to a chorągiew of a particular land, where knights had their estates. Poorer knights enlisted to the chorągiews created and maintained by magnates, or to a few mercenary royal chorągiews created under king's order by a particular, rich and famous commandander. Infantry {{was made up of}} peasants (one of five men of royal villages: four remaining in the village had to equip and arm the fifth). Burghers had to defend their cities, and different guilds were responsible for particular part of the walls' defense. They, as much richer than peasants, were able to <b>get</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> armours and weapons: light helmets, mail, or mail-plate armours; in addition they were taught how to fight, for which purpose the shot brotherhoods were created.|$|E

[...] It is one of the only three Family Guy episodes that has ever been given a [...] "Masterpiece" [...] (10/10) rating by IGN, the other being [...] "I Never Met the Dead Man" [...] and [...] "Da Boom", leading many to consider this episode as the greatest in Family Guy's history.

They praised Lenard, but thought that Stewart [...] "steals the show with an extraordinary performance". Chris Gregory, in his book Star Trek: Parallel Narratives, suggested that Bendii syndrome as seen in this episode [...] "has echoes of Alzheimer's disease". James Van Hise and Hal Schumer, in The Complete Trek: The Next Generation, compared the plot of [...] "Sarek" [...] to that of The Original Series episode [...] "Day of the Dove".

500|$|William Wong of Computer Shopper {{called it}} [...] "a great game that {{is backed by}} good {{graphics}} and sound, and will keep you going for hours"; he also praised its cutscenes. He concluded, [...] "If the [...] multiplayer pack {{is as good as}} the standalone version, Terra Nova could be a strike force to be reckoned with." [...] PC Gamer UKs James Flynn praised the game's graphics, sense of realism, and free-form missions; about the latter, he wrote, [...] "There's no right or wrong way to complete any of the missions in Terra Nova, {{and this is one of}} its strongest assets." [...] He noted that it was [...] "virtually impossible to recommend" [...] the game to those with lower-end computers, but he believed that it was also [...] "impossible to condemn Looking Glass for programming the game this way, because it feels so real, and its authenticity is what makes it so much fun". Daniel Jevons of Maximum approved of the graphics but disliked the focus on long-range combat and the use of the mouse to move a crosshair rather than the entire viewpoint. However, he concluded that the game [...] "has a degree of depth that most robot combat games lack, the plot is strangely involving and despite the initial control difficulties, with perseverance most competent gamers will soon be stomping around the battlefields". Michael E. Ryan of PC Magazine praised the game's artificial intelligence and called its graphical quality [...] "spectacular", but found its movement controls to be [...] "awkward". He concluded, [...] "Terra Nova is an exceptional game that combines frenetic, fast-paced action with real-time squad-level tactics. It doesn't <b>get</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than this".|$|E

2500|$|In mid-August, the Luftwaffe {{was ready}} to begin the main assault over the British mainland. The {{campaign}} opened on 13 August 1940, christened Adlertag (Eagle Day), by Hermann Göring. The entire day met with repeated German failures, in communication, intelligence, and coordination. The objective of the raids, Fighter Command's airfields, remained unscathed. Richthofen's Ju 87s were involved over the Portland area, and in actions against RAF Warmwell and RAF Middle Wallop. Cloudy skies were {{largely responsible for the}} failure of the raids. The campaign did not <b>get</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> for Richthofen, on 15 August, known as The Greatest Day. On 16 August, elements of StG 2 had success against RAF Tangmere, in which they destroyed 15 aircraft (seven Hawker Hurricanes and six Bristol Blenheim night fighters). Damage was done to buildings and workshops, but for a loss of nine Ju 87s and three severely damaged. Three days later, the Ju 87s suffered their greatest defeat. On 18 August, a large group of air battles led the day to be called [...] "The Hardest Day". On that day, Richthofen sent his units against airfields in southern England. Faulty intelligence meant all those hit by his units were unimportant. StG 77 struck at Fleet Air Arm bases, which {{had little to do with}} Fighter Command. In the process, the Geschwader took heavy losses.|$|E

This might mean that {{children}} are aware of syllables as units of speech early on, while they don’t show awareness of individual phonemes until school age. Another explanation is that individual sounds do not easily translate into beats, which makes clapping individual phonemes a much more difficult task than clapping syllables. One reason why phoneme awareness <b>gets</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> once children start school is because learning to read provides a visual aid as how to break up words into their smaller constituents.|$|R

The size of these economic datasets is often very small. Many models based on grey system theory could be adapted to various economic time series data.
