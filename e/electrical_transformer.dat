25|$|From {{the spring}} of 1996 until November 30, 1997 a popular {{attraction}} for tourists to the islands was the male albino 'White Raven'. He lived around Port Clements and would commonly be seen taking food handouts from locals and visitors alike. He died after making contact with an <b>electrical</b> <b>transformer.</b> The White Raven was preserved by former Port Clements residents, taxidermists Roger Britten Sr. and Jr., and is {{on display in the}} Port Clements Historical Society's museum.|$|E
25|$|A {{building}} at London South Bank University, which houses the institute's electrical engineering departments is named the Faraday Wing, {{due to its}} proximity to Faraday's birthplace in Newington Butts. A hall at Loughborough University was named after Faraday in 1960. Near the entrance to its dining hall is a bronze casting, which depicts the symbol of an <b>electrical</b> <b>transformer,</b> and inside there hangs a portrait, both in Faraday's honour. An eight-story {{building at}} the University of Edinburgh's science & engineering campus is named for Faraday, as is a recently built hall of accommodation at Brunel University, the main engineering building at Swansea University, and the instructional and experimental physics building at Northern Illinois University. The former UK Faraday Station in Antarctica was named after him.|$|E

40|$|Often, the {{electrical}} transforming stations {{are located in}} the proximity of inhabited areas. The <b>electrical</b> <b>transformers</b> from the stations generate noise that affects the residents of these areas. In this paper we will present the results obtained by identifying the sources of noise from the <b>electrical</b> <b>transformers</b> and their typical levels. We will also approach the methods of reducing the acoustic pollution which is generated as a result...|$|R

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1987, Berdella became {{friendly}} with a 20-year-old named Larry Wayne Pearson. This casual friendship began when Pearson entered his shop and explained to Berdella that, as a child, he had held an interest in both witchcraft and wizadry. Shortly thereafter, Pearson temporarily lodged with Berdella, and willingly performed chores around his home {{as a means of}} paying rent. According to Berdella, he did not initially intend to capture this individual, but formed the plan to do so on June 23 when, having bailed Pearson out of jail, the younger man began jokingly referring to his practice of robbing gay men in Wichita. That evening, Berdella ensured Pearson became intoxicated before injecting him with chlorpromazine and moving him down to his basement, where he bound Pearson's hands above his head, then linked the rope he had used for this purpose to a brick column, before injecting Pearson's larynx with drain cleaner. He then brought an <b>electrical</b> <b>transformer</b> to the basement.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the station, guests boarded a large, open-air aerial tram vehicle. There, a live guide aboard the tram informed {{them that they were}} being evacuated off of Manhattan Island and over to Roosevelt Island during Kong's attack. The tram's radio was tuned to the police emergency frequency so that guests could be informed of Kong's location in the city. The tram traveled above the streets of downtown New York City where guests could view Kong's path of destruction. There was a water geyser from a broken fire hydrant, broken steam pipes, crashed and overturned cars, and a subway train partly derailed from its elevated track. A police chopper described the scene around the tram over the radio, alerting that Kong was approaching the tramway and that he was grabbing a power pole. Kong's silhouette could briefly be seen as a spotlight shone on a building ahead of the tram. As the tram passed the power pole, it tipped over and its <b>electrical</b> <b>transformer</b> exploded, unleashing a shower of sparks and fire, which ignited the derailed elevated subway train.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Bryson's escape, Berdella was arrested on charges pertaining to the sexual assault of Christopher Bryson. He declined to allow officers inside his home, and the search warrant earlier requested was drafted to search his property. Corroborating Bryson's claims to have been restrained and tortured in a second floor bedroom, investigators discovered the bedroom {{on the second floor}} was found to have burnt ropes attached to the posts {{at the foot of the}} bed. Also in the room was an <b>electrical</b> <b>transformer,</b> plugged into a wall, and with wires leading to the bed. A metal tray containing syringes, small bottles apparently containing prescription drugs, swabs, and eye drops was also close to the bed. Also found in the room were a long iron pipe, various lengths of rope, and leather belts. Investigators also noted that although Bryson's restraints had been tied to posts at each corner of the bed, other posts on the bed had been extensively worn, suggesting that restraints had earlier been tied to these posts, and that the individual or individuals had struggled to free themselves.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1926, Allis-Chalmers {{acquired}} Nordyke Marmon & Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, a {{maker of}} flour-milling equipment. In 1927, it acquired the Pittsburgh Transformer Company, {{a maker of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>transformers.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{airport at}} Santa Maria {{was part of}} a larger complex of {{buildings}} and infrastructures constructed in the 20th century. Apart of the airport terminals and ground control facilities, the area later known as Aeroporto locally, included a residential barrio, the services and equipment to support local residences, roadways and many of first signals, public transport stops and <b>electrical</b> <b>transformer</b> stations. The development of this district was important in the development of the island, with many of the installations left by American troops after the Second World War (the early terminal, control tower, building of Clube Asas do Atlântico, gymnasium, cinemas and warehouses) and many of the semi-cylindrical troop-quarters retained after the withdraw of forces. Its North American influence and original purpose marks its differences to local construction; the urban design and buildings, just like many of the projected constructions by architect Keil do Amaral (the airport, residence of airport director, groups of residences and signalling) make the district distinct from the other areas of the island. The newer neighborhoods and recent buildings, are of an inferior architectural quality, and correspond to the blocks closer to the airport.|$|E

50|$|In 2012, Extended Power Uprate {{modifications}} were completed, {{increasing the}} electric output from approximately 853 MW to 1,002 MW.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the six main buildings there are several secondary buildings in the Rim Village Historic District. [...] Significant among these minor buildings is Comfort Station #4 (building 72). [...] It is an original building constructed in the early 1930s. [...] This building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 as Comfort Station No. 72 (NRHP #88002625).

2500|$|KD Station {{weathered}} {{a certain}} amount of adversity, including the opening of the Southern Hills Mall in 1980 and the general decline of the stockyards area. [...] However, in 2004, a fire that began in an outdoor <b>electrical</b> <b>transformer</b> caused extensive damage to the building; at about the same time, a major leak developed in the roof. [...] The owners declared themselves unable to maintain the building, and the city declared it unsafe and unfit for occupancy, forcing the nearly 20 businesses to relocate. [...] In 2006, teenaged arsonists used gasoline to start a fire on the fourth floor, further damaging the building.|$|E
50|$|Mineral oil is used {{extensively}} inside <b>electrical</b> <b>transformers</b> as a fluid dielectric and {{to assist in}} cooling.

2500|$|The eternal flame {{has been}} {{extinguished}} {{a few times}} by accident. [...] On December 10, 1963, a group of Catholic schoolchildren were sprinkling the temporary flame with holy water. The cap came off the bottle and water poured onto the flame, putting it out. A cemetery official quickly relit the flame by hand. In August 1967, an exceptionally heavy rain extinguished the permanent flame. A nearby <b>electrical</b> <b>transformer</b> flooded as well, depriving the spark igniter of power and preventing the flame from being relit. After the rain ended, a cemetery official relit the flame by hand. Two of the gravesite's flagstones {{had to be removed}} to access the transformer and repair it.|$|E
