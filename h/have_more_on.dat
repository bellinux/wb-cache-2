The smaller one chewed {{it a long}} time, and frothed much at the mouth. He {{appeared}} to swallow very little of it, but the larger one ate the whole up without difficulty. After {{more than two hours}} no effect whatever being perceptible in either animal, they were shot to get rid of them. These experiments, though not altogether complete, certainly establish {{the fact that it is}} a poison of no very great activity. The quantity made use of in the second experiment was too great to allow a fair deduction to be made as to its properties. When a fourth to a sixth of the quantity was employed in the third experiment the same effects followed, but with rather less rapidity; death resulting in the one case in ten, in the other in sixteen minutes, although the death in the latter case was perhaps hastened by the loss of blood. The symptoms more resemble those produced by nux vomica than by any other agent. No apparent drowsiness, spasms, slight at first, beginning in the neck, increasing in intensity, extending over the whole body, and finally stopping respiration and with it the action of the heart. Experiments first and fourth show that a moderate quantity, such as may be introduced on the point of an arrow, produced no sensible effect either on a goat or a rabbit, and it could scarcely be supposed that it would <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> a man than on the latter animal; and the fifth experiment proves that a full dose taken into the stomach produces no result within a reasonable time.|$|E

[...] However, by June 1917 newspapers reported that Plank's career was nearly over; he had struggled with arm problems and had left the team at one point due to a nervous breakdown. [...] He retired in October 1917, citing stomach difficulties brought on by the stress of baseball. His final game was a 1-0 11-inning complete game loss to Walter Johnson and the Washington Senators on August 6, 1917. Despite his announcement, the New York Yankees traded pitchers Urban Shocker and Nick Cullop, infielders Fritz Maisel and Joe Gedeon, catcher Les Nunamaker, and cash to the Browns for Plank and Del Pratt. Plank refused to report to New York, insisting he was retired.|$|E
5000|$|David Edelstein of New York {{praised the}} film's revisionist tone {{and said the}} film was [...] "strongly {{influenced}} {{by a lot of}} smart, feminist thinking". Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4. A.O. Scott of The New York Times praised Theron's performance and also wrote, [...] "Though it is an ambitious - at times mesmerizing - application of the latest cinematic technology, the movie tries to recapture some of the menace of the stories that used to be told to scare children rather than console them." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "Ravenna hates living in a world where men can feed on women's beauty and then toss them away. She's a fascist of feminism, and Theron's acting has the blood of operatic anger coursing through it." [...] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times said the film is, [...] "an absolute wonder to watch and creates a warrior princess for the ages. But what this revisionist fairy tale does not give us is a passionate love - its kisses are as chaste as the snow is white." [...] Rolling Stones Peter Travers called it [...] "a visual marvel" [...] while noting that Stewart [...] "morphs convincingly from a skittish girl into a determined warrior princess." [...] MSN news said that Stewart [...] "grows into her character, it seems, and eventually got this reviewer completely on her side. Colin Covert of the Minneapolis Star Tribune gave the film 4/4 stars. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian said that while the film is [...] "less jokey than the recent Mirror Mirror", [...] "this Twilightified fairytale has the same basic problem," [...] and that, [...] "The result is tangled and overblown." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle called it [...] "a slow, boring film that has no charm and is highlighted only by a handful of special effects and Charlize Theron's truly evil queen." [...] Michael O'Sullivan of the Washington Post also gave the film a negative review: [...] "Overlong, overcrowded, overstimulating and with an over-the-top performance by Charlize Theron as the evil queen Ravenna, the movie is a virtual orchard of toxic excess, starting with the unnecessarily sprawling cast of characters." [...] Lisa Kennedy of the Denver Post gave the film two out of four stars and said, [...] "Only Bob Hoskins as the blind seer Muir comes close to making us care. We can almost glean Snow White's heroic possibilities through his clouded eyes. As much as we'd like to, we certainly can't from Stewart's efforts." [...] Scott Foundas states that [...] "Stewart’s Snow White... pouts her lips, bats her bedroom eyes, and scarcely seems to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>on</b> her mind than who might take her to the senior prom—let alone the destiny of an entire kingdom." [...] Richard Roeper gave the movie a B+, calling it [...] "Vastly superior to Mirror, Mirror", and praising Theron and Stewart's performances.|$|E
