30|$|These results {{indicate}} that the computation time of the SOCP formulation is much shorter than that of the NLP models. In addition, we found that to obtain the lowest gas fuel cost, the <b>gas</b> <b>storages</b> of nodes 2, 5, 13, and 14 have to account for more gas supply. The mismatch in the gas suppliers’ generation schedule in the two formulations is primarily because the SOCP formulation transforms the initial NLP problem into a convex optimization problem, and the global optimal solution can be found. By contrast, the non-convex NLP problem only obtains the local optimal solution.|$|R
