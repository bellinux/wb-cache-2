5|$|Petre Vasiliu-Năsturel {{observes that}} from a heraldic point of view, on the French {{as well as the}} revolutionary Wallachian flag, the middle stripe {{represents}} a heraldic metal (argent and or respectively). Other writers believe that the tricolor was not an imitation of the French flag, instead embodying an old Romanian tradition. This theory is supported by a note from the revolutionary foreign minister to Emin Pasha: “the colors of the band that we the leaders wear, as well as all our followers, are not of modern origin. We have <b>had</b> <b>our</b> flags since an earlier time. When we received the tricolor insignia and bands we did not follow the spirit of imitation or fashion”.|$|E

500|$|While many of Rubber Souls {{prominent}} {{songs were}} {{the product of}} Lennon and McCartney's collaborative songwriting, it also featured distinct compositions from each, though they continued to share official credit. The song [...] "In My Life", of which each later claimed lead authorship, is considered a highlight of the entire Lennon–McCartney catalogue. Harrison called Rubber Soul his [...] "favourite album" [...] and Starr {{referred to it as}} [...] "the departure record". McCartney has said, [...] "We'd <b>had</b> <b>our</b> cute period, and now it was time to expand." [...] However, recording engineer Norman Smith later stated that the studio sessions revealed signs of growing conflict within the group – [...] "the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious", he wrote, and [...] "as far as Paul was concerned, George could do no right". In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Rubber Soul fifth among [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time", and AllMusic's Richie Unterberger describes it as [...] "one of the classic folk-rock records".|$|E

Parker met with De Silva in Manhattan, New York, where it was decided that he would draft his own script with Gore receiving sole screenwriting credit and Parker's colleague Alan Marshall being enlisted as a producer. Gore travelled to London, England, where he and Parker began work on a second draft script. Their new script became significantly darker than what De Silva had originally intended. De Silva said, [...] "I was really motivated and interested in the joy of what the school represented for these kids, and [...] was really much more interested in where the pain was in going to the school, and so we <b>had</b> <b>our</b> little conflicts based on that area." ...|$|E

500|$|Starbucks founder Howard Schultz {{reached out}} to Turlington to support her {{foundation}} Every Mother Counts, which seeks to make pregnancy and childbirth safe for mothers. David Legry, who served as Starbucks' editorial manager, helped shape the compilation after reading about Turlington's humanitarian work, and later worked with artists to select suitable songs. Turlington then recruited several artists, including: Carla Bruni, Sheryl Crow, Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, her friend Gwyneth Paltrow, and Martha Wainwright, {{to contribute to the}} project. She contacted all participating artists, and recalled: We already <b>had</b> <b>our</b> soundtrack, and I already had Martha Wainwright singing [...] "No Woman, No Cry," [...] which was great, but it got us all thinking that a compilation CD would be a great way to target women who are artists and also mothers and see what they're willing to contribute. So I wrote some letters and spoke to a few of the women that are on the CD, and threw the idea out and pretty much everybody that we went to is on this list and said yes and was really excited.|$|E
500|$|However, {{after the}} splendour of the premiere and the praise of some reviewers, when the Andersons {{departed}} {{on a tour}} of Britain to promote the film it was revealed that public interest was mediocre and box office revenue poor, as Gerry Anderson explains: [...] "When we got off the plane at the first destination we were told that the film was in trouble. Cinemas were apparently half-full. When we got to the next big city we got more news that made us even more depressed – box office figures were inexplicably low wherever we went." [...] Anderson proposes that the presence of Thunderbirds on television damaged the chances of its big-screen transfer, asserting, [...] "The only thing we could think was that at that time the audience was not used to seeing a feature film version of a television show. So people would see Thunderbirds and think, 'We've seen it on television.'" [...] Sylvia Anderson offers a similar explanation: [...] "Although we still <b>had</b> <b>our</b> loyal television fans, they remained just that – firmly seated in front of their television screens and not in the cinema." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} ship the game, Bungie began paring back their ambitions for the single- and {{multiplayer}} {{parts of the}} game. Chris Butcher commented, [...] "For Halo 2 we <b>had</b> <b>our</b> sights set very high on networking. ... Going from having no Internet multiplayer to developing a completely new online model was a big challenge to tackle all at once, {{and as a result}} we had to leave a lot of things undone {{in order to meet the}} ship date commitment that we made to our fans." [...] With only a year to go until release, Bungie went into the [...] "mother of all crunches" [...] in order to finish the game; in a 2007 interview, Jamie Griesemer, one of Halos design leads, said that this lack of a [...] "polish" [...] period near the end of the development cycle was the main reason for Halo 2s shortcomings. Butcher retrospectively described Halo 2s multiplayer mode as [...] "a pale shadow of what it could and should have been if we had gotten the timing of our schedule right"; the campaign mode's abrupt cliffhanger ending also resulted from the frenzy to ship on time.|$|E

500|$|By the {{standards}} of the Western front, the gains of the first two days were nothing short of spectacular. A great deal of ground was gained for relatively few casualties and a number of strategically significant points were captured, notably Vimy Ridge. Additionally, the offensive succeeded in drawing German troops away from the French offensive in the Aisne sector. In many respects, the battle might be deemed a victory for the British and their allies but these gains were offset by high casualties and the ultimate failure of the French offensive at the Aisne. By the end of the offensive, the British had suffered more than 150,000 casualties and gained little ground since the first day. Despite significant early gains, they were unable to effect a breakthrough and the situation reverted to stalemate. Although historians generally consider the battle a British victory, in the wider context of the front, it had very little impact on the strategic or tactical situation. Ludendorff later commented [...] "no doubt exceedingly important strategic objects lay behind the British attack but I {{have never been able to}} discover what they were". Ludendorff was also [...] "very depressed; <b>had</b> <b>our</b> principles of defensive tactics proved false and if so, what was to be done?" ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of the band's {{previous}} albums Almost There and Spoken For, MercyMe was given [...] "significantly" [...] more resources to develop their next record by their record label, INO Records. Although they decided not to alter their Christian approach to songwriting, live performances, and interviews, they opted to work with outside songwriters on the album, employed the London Symphony Orchestra to play strings on several tracks, and added a sixth member to the band, guitarist Barry Graul. Additionally, MercyMe wrote and recorded the music for Undone before they wrote any of the lyrics. Lead singer Bart Millard noted that by using this method, instead of his lyrics swaying the musical elements of the song, the music acted as [...] "a canvas with which to write [...] ". He elaborated that [...] "We’ve been making records for 10 years, so anything that sparks creativity... is very much welcomed". The title of the album was inspired by [...] "the unexpected twists and turns in the band's journey"; Millard commented that [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>our</b> plans for {{what we were going to}} do; but when the bigger picture happened, all of our plans came unraveled. We don’t know what tomorrow will hold. When you make your own plans, you suddenly find yourself undone; and that’s exactly where God wants us in the first place".|$|E
500|$|In August 1965, the Beatles {{released}} the McCartney composition [...] "Yesterday", featuring a string quartet. Included on the Help! LP, {{the song was}} the group's first recorded use of classical music elements and their first recording that involved only a single band member. [...] "Yesterday" [...] {{became one of the}} most covered songs in popular music history. Later that year, during recording sessions for the album Rubber Soul, McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant musical force in the band. Musicologist Ian MacDonald wrote, [...] "from ... would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter, but also as instrumentalist, arranger, producer, and de facto musical director of the Beatles." [...] Critics described Rubber Soul as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity of the band's music and lyrics. Considered a high point in the Beatles catalogue, both Lennon and McCartney said they had written the music for the song [...] "In My Life". McCartney said of the album, [...] "we'd <b>had</b> <b>our</b> cute period, and now it was time to expand." [...] Recording engineer Norman Smith stated that the Rubber Soul sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within the band: [...] "the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious... as far as Paul was concerned, George [...] could do no right—Paul was absolutely finicky." ...|$|E
