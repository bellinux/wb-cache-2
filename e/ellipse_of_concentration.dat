The advantage of the graphical approach is stressed. An example [...] the bushfire data [...] is analyzed using some sequentially trimmed Mahalanobis distances and the grand tour. The last approach provides much better insight into the shape {{and content of the}} analyzed cloud of data points. 1 THE PROBLEM When performing a statistical analysis one should be very careful not to permit the analysis be influenced by some outliers hidden in the data. The outliers may mask each other and be difficult to detect. There are many examples that a careless data analysis may yield quite wrong solutions.

In this study, a real-coded genetic algorithm was adopted to fitting a mixed Bingham distribution to orientation data by maximizing the log-likelihood function of the distribution. The maximization is a difficult problem, because the function has multimodality and singularity. It {{was found that the}} algorithm was effective for this problem. Given the orientations of dilational fractures, the present method determines not only the stress axes and stress ratio of each of the fracture groups but also the maximum non-dimensionalized fluid pressure {{at the time of their}} formation. In addition, the software calculates the 95 [*]% error <b>ellipses</b> <b>of</b> the <b>concentration</b> axes. The present method found that the orientations of ore veins of the Akenobe Mine, SW Japan, should be partitioned into three clusters. It is shown that two of the groups had distinctive Zn and Sn contents, and that the ore fluids had overpressures only slightly greater than the minimum principal stress at the time of the deposition of Zn- and Sn-rich veins. 混合ビンガム分布を最尤法で方向データにフィッティングする問題は,尤度関数が 10 次元を超える多次元の関数で,しかも多峰的関数であるために,非常に困難な問題である. 今回開発した実数値遺伝的アルゴリズムは,この問題を効率的に解くことができる. 岩脈群や鉱脈群に適用すると,各クラスターで 3 本の主応力軸と応力比が決まり,また,無次元化流体圧を制約することができる. 認定すべきクラスター数もわかる. 明延鉱山の鉱脈群に適用したところ,方向により 3 つのクラスターに分かれ,そのうち 2 つはZnが比較的豊富な鉱脈とSnが比較的豊富な鉱脈であった. つまり,応力の変化と鉱液の化学組成の変化が連動していた可能性がしめされた...|$|R

40|$|First, we fill in key gaps in Steiner's nice {{characterization}} of the most nearly circular ellipse which passes through the vertices of a convex quadrilateral, D. Steiner proved {{that there is only}} one pair of conjugate directions, M 1 and M 2, that belong to all <b>ellipses</b> <b>of</b> circumscription. Then he proves that if there is an ellipse, E, whose equal conjugate diameters possess the directional constants M 1 and M 2, then E must be an <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> circumscription which has minimal eccentricity. However, Steiner does not show the existence or uniqueness <b>of</b> such an <b>ellipse.</b> We prove that there is a unique <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> minimal eccentricity which passes through the vertices of D. We also show that there exists an ellipse which passes through the vertices of D and whose equal conjugate diameters possess the directional constants M 1 and M 2. We also show that there exists a unique <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> minimal area which passes through the vertices of D. Finally, we call a convex quadrilateral, D, bielliptic if the unique inscribed and circumscribed <b>ellipses</b> <b>of</b> minimal eccentricity have the same eccentricity. This generalizes the notion of bicentric quadrilaterals. In particular we show the existence of a bielliptic convex quadrilateral which is not bicentric.

40|$|We {{prove that}} {{there exists a}} unique <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> minimal eccentricity, E_{I}, inscribed in a parallelogram, D. We also prove that the {{smallest}} nonnegative angle between equal conjugate diameters of E_{I} equals the smallest nonnegative angle between the diagonals of D. We also prove that if E_{M} is the unique ellipse inscribed in a rectangle, R, which is tangent at the midpoints of the sides of R, then E_{M} is the unique <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> minimal eccentricity, maximal area, and maximal arc length inscribed in R. Let D be any convex quadrilateral. In previous papers, the author proved {{that there is a}} unique <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> minimal eccentricity, E_{I}, inscribed in D, and a unique <b>ellipse,</b> E_{O}, <b>of</b> minimal eccentricity circumscribed about D. We defined D to be bielliptic if E_{I} and E_{O} have the same eccentricity. In this paper we show that a parallelogram, D, is bielliptic if and only if the square of the length of one of the diagonals of D equals twice the square of the length of one of the sides of D.

40|$|This paper proposes {{two methods}} for {{analyzing}} error propagation in overlay analysis of vector polygons, an analytical and simulation method. First, for the analytical method, the error is derived {{based on the}} error propagation law in statistics. In the second method, error propagation of overlay is simulated based on the positional error of the original polygon vertices, assuming a given error distribution of the vertices. For both methods, several geometrical error measures for the derived polygons are defined: (i) error measures for the perimeter, area and center of gravity of a polygon, and (ii) the error intervals for the polygon vertices. A test is performed to compare {{the differences between the}} two methods and their applicability. The results indicate that there is no significant difference in estimating the propagated error between the two methods. However, these two methods are suitable for different cases. The analytical method is applicable when the error <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> any intersection point of the original polygons does not intersect with error <b>ellipses</b> <b>of</b> all the vertices of the original polygons, if the intersection point exists; or, in case of disjoint polygon boundaries, the error <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> any point on the boundary of one original polygon does not intersect with the error <b>ellipse</b> <b>of</b> any point on the boundary of the other original polygons. On the other hand, the simulation method is more generic, but more time consuming. Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatic...|$|R
