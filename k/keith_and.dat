40|$|This study explores how Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT) members’ self-conceptions change {{throughout}} the course of their involvement with the CPT. To address this issue, I produce an ethnographic life history account of two members of CPT, <b>Keith</b> Rempel <b>and</b> Lena Siegers. This thesis offers both a descriptive survey of CPT and a record of the life histories collected through ﬁeldwork with the organization. The thesis devotes special attention to how these CPT members understand their religious identities; speciﬁcally, their sense of being similar to or different from their families, friends and religious tradition—in this case, the Mennonite faith. Charles Taylor’s theories of identity formation form the basis of this investigation of <b>Keith’s</b> <b>and</b> Lena’s self-conceptions. Their understanding of their faith and how it motivates the work that they do in situations characterized by violence is also examined. There are two primary conclusions. First, while CPT connects with <b>Keith’s</b> <b>and</b> Lena’s identities, especially as Mennonites, involvement with CPT accentuates their actual and perceived difference from their families, friends and religious tradition. Second, work with CPT also strengthens <b>Keith’s</b> <b>and</b> Lena’s commitments to their faith, {{while at the same time}} making it more political...|$|R
5|$|Connections among Coolbrith's {{circle of}} friends {{resulted}} in a librarian job at San Francisco's Mercantile Library Association in 1898, and she moved back to Russian Hill in San Francisco. In January 1899, artist William <b>Keith</b> <b>and</b> poet Charles Keeler obtained for her a part-time position as librarian of the Bohemian Club, of which <b>Keith</b> <b>and</b> Keeler were members. Her first assignment was to edit Songs from Bohemia, a book of poems by Daniel O'Connell, Bohemian Club co-founder and journalist, following his death. Her salary was $50 each month, less than she had been earning in Oakland, but her duties were light enough {{that she was able}} to devote a greater proportion of her time to writing, and she signed on as sometime staff of Charles Fletcher Lummis's The Land of Sunshine magazine. As a personal project, she began to work on a history of California literature.|$|E
5|$|In 1885 the Great North re-timed the 10:10am Aberdeen {{service to}} reach Keith at 11:50am with through {{carriages}} that reached Elgin via Craigellachie at 1pm. This {{connected with a}} Highland service at both <b>Keith</b> <b>and</b> Elgin, until the Highland re-timed the train and broke the connection at Elgin. The Great North applied to the Board of Trade for an order for two connections a day at Elgin. This was refused, but in 1886 the Great North and Highland railways came to an agreement to pool receipts from the stations between Grange and Elgin and refer any disputes to an arbiter. The midday Highland train was re-timed {{to connect with the}} Great North at <b>Keith</b> <b>and</b> Elgin, and a service connected at Elgin with an Aberdeen train that had divided en route to travel via the coast and Craigellachie.|$|E

5|$|Although Purkinje {{fibers and}} {{the bundle of}} His were {{discovered}} {{as early as the}} 19th century, their specific role in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until Sunao Tawara published his monograph, titled Das Reizleitungssystem des Säugetierherzens, in 1906. Tawara's discovery of the atrioventricular node prompted Arthur <b>Keith</b> <b>and</b> Martin Flack to look for similar structures in the heart, leading to their discovery of the sinoatrial node several months later. These structures form the anatomical basis of the electrocardiogram, whose inventor, Willem Einthoven, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1924.|$|E

Once Keith sees the license plate number of the woman's car, he stops the investigation and files the photograph. Puzzled by his actions, Veronica finds the file and learns that Keith has continued his own personal investigation of Lilly's murder. Veronica discovers that the car belongs to her missing mother, Lianne, and begins to investigate the murder herself.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Johnson was apprenticed to George Keith, a London {{bookseller}} {{who specialized}} in publishing religious tracts such as Reflections on the Modern but Unchristian Practice of Innoculation. As Gerald Tyson, Johnson's major modern biographer, explains, it was unusual for the younger son of a family living in relative obscurity to move to London and to become a bookseller. Scholars have speculated that Johnson was indentured to Keith because the bookseller was associated with Liverpool Baptists. <b>Keith</b> <b>and</b> Johnson published several works together later in their careers, {{which suggests that the}} two remained on friendly terms after Johnson started his own business.|$|E

5|$|During the {{engagement}} between Streatham and Caroline, Lord <b>Keith</b> <b>and</b> Europe had fired sporadically at the French ship with little effect. Pulling {{away from his}} surrendered opponent, Féretier then fired on Lord Keith, whose captain, Peter Campbell, realised that his ship stood no chance against the frigate and turned eastward, running before the wind to escape despite suffering severe damage to Lord Keith rigging as he did so. William Gelston, captain of Europe, also attempted to flee, but his battered ship was in no condition to outrun the virtually untouched frigate, and he surrendered at 10:00. Lord Keith eventually arrived safely at Penang on 9 June. Casualties on the British ships were six killed and at least four wounded, while the French lost one killed and three wounded.|$|E
