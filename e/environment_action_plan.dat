The Region’s participation was supported by resolutions of the conferences, which were held in Sofia (1995) and Aahus (1998). In particular, in Aahus, the decision was made by CAR countries to begin drafting a regional environmental action plan (REAP), which was widely supported. The process of NEAP was an important stage, which was launched in the majority of the region’s countries. It allowed a shift from comprehensive and unrealistic programs to priority actions and extensive work with donors. At present, the countries of the region participate extensively in similar programs established for the NIS in 2002.The Regional <b>Environment</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> for Central Asia (REAP) has been developed with the assistance and under the guidance of the UNEP/UNDP.

PANA II echoes the approaches of the Johannesburg Summit of September 2002. Its aim is to influence public sector activities, but also to be taken up by civil society, leading to concrete results in the private sector. The plan is based on an evaluation of natural resources, which are viewed as assets and services to the environment, used by Man for various ends (production, space, protection, regulation) or for cultural and aesthetic purposes. Taking a decentralised approach, various Municipal Environmental Plans (PEM) have also been drawn up by local teams, with the help of participants from the municipe. These PEM therefore reflect the viewpoints and expectations of local people on common problems, {{as well as on the}} solutions found for them. This democratic process, which involved a number of meetings attended by more than 3, 000 local people, led to the design of a range of development programmes, supported by studies carried out at global level.

This article presents the recommendations of the workgroup regarding specific reprotoxic effects. Abnormal development of foetuses and infants, together with impairment of reproduction were considered to be critical effects. Where critical windows of exposure were concerned, quantitative analysis suggested the need for several types of toxicity reference value, as a function of exposure duration: reprotoxic effects may result from acute or chronic exposure at any time of life, whilst developmental effects may occur after exposure during the pregnancy or during the lactation period. The choice of a critical study is based on epidemiological or toxicological quality criteria. The working group recommends the use of the benchmark dose approach in estimating the critical dose.

However, there are five areas in which Dutch policy does not meet these agreements. These are: 1. child-friendly urban planning; 2. children's facilities for social interaction, play and sports; 3. regulations for construction and furniture materials; 4. reducing emissions from transport and industry; and 5. monitoring exposure of children to substances. For a number of subjects, e. g. indoor air quality and children's exposure to chemicals, research is still ongoing. Results of current projects will provide insight into these issues. These are the findings of a Dutch inventory as follow-up of the WHO Ministerial Conference on Environment and Health in 2004 in Budapest. Fifty-two European countries, including the Netherlands, entered into agreements on a number of subjects in the area of environment and health as related to children. Within this framework, WHO has developed the Children's Environment and Health Action Plan for Europe (CEHAPE). The Netherlands has signed the Ministerial Declaration and CEHAPE.

In static environments, standard value iteration techniques are used for computing the optimal policy. In dynamic environments, an algorithm is proposed for fast replanning, which updates a subset of state-action values computed for the static environment. As a test-bed, the goal scoring task in the RoboCup 4 -legged scenario is used. The algorithms are validated in the problem of planning kicks for scoring goals {{in the presence of}} opponent robots. The experimental results both in simulation and on real robots show that the instance-based action model boosts performance over using parameterized models as done previously, and also replanning significantly improves over original off-line planning.
