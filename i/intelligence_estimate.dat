25|$|Unlike the Germans, {{prior to}} the war the RAF and the USAAF (under the command of General Henry H. Arnold), {{developed}} strategic bomber forces. From 1942 onwards their bombers penetrated deep into Reich's territory in increasing numbers. This forced the Luftwaffe to substantially increase the fighter allocation to the Western Front in 1943, which in the Allied <b>intelligence</b> <b>estimate,</b> accounted for 60% of the total, with the Russian Front allocated 22% and the Mediterranean Front 18% of its fighters.|$|E

25|$|In August, a National <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Estimate,</b> {{produced}} by the CIA, predicted that the Communists, legitimized by the Geneva agreement, would take quick control of the North, and plan to take over all of Vietnam. The estimate went on that Diệm's government was opposed both by Communist and non-Communist elements. Pro-French factions were seen as preparing to overthrow it, while Viet Minh would take a longer view. Under command of the north, Viet Minh individuals and small units will stay {{in the south and}} create an underground, discredit the government, and undermine French-Vietnamese relations.|$|E
25|$|This {{led to the}} {{creation}} of the Air Force's Project Sign at the end of 1947, one of the earliest government studies to come to a secret extraterrestrial conclusion. In August 1948, Sign investigators wrote a top-secret <b>intelligence</b> <b>estimate</b> to that effect, but the Air Force Chief of Staff Hoyt Vandenberg ordered it destroyed. The existence of this suppressed report was revealed by several insiders who had read it, such as astronomer and USAF consultant J. Allen Hynek and Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt, the first head of the USAF's Project Blue Book.|$|E
25|$|Intellipedia {{was created}} to share {{information}} {{on some of the}} most difficult subjects facing U.S. intelligence and to bring cutting-edge technology into its ever-more-youthful workforce.

A number of projects are under way to explore the use of the Intellipedia for the creation of traditional Intelligence Community products. In the summer of 2006, Intellipedia was the main collaboration tool in constructing a National <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Estimate</b> on Nigeria.|$|E

25|$|Sign {{was officially}} {{inconclusive}} regarding {{the cause of}} the sightings. However, according to US Air Force Captain Edward J. Ruppelt (the first director of Project Blue Book), Sign's initial <b>intelligence</b> <b>estimate</b> (the so-called Estimate of the Situation) written in the late summer of 1948, concluded that the flying saucers were real craft, were not made by either the Soviet Union or United States, and were likely extraterrestrial in origin. (See also extraterrestrial hypothesis.) This estimate was forwarded to the Pentagon, but subsequently ordered destroyed by Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg, USAF Chief of Staff, citing a lack of physical proof. Vandenberg subsequently dismantled Project Sign.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s, {{the revelation}} of Iran's clandestine uranium {{enrichment}} program raised concerns {{that it might be}} intended for non-peaceful uses. The IAEA launched an investigation in 2003 after an Iranian dissident group revealed undeclared nuclear activities carried out by Iran. In 2006, because of Iran's noncompliance with its NPT obligations, the United Nations Security Council demanded that Iran suspend its enrichment programs. In 2007, the United States National <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Estimate</b> (NIE) stated that Iran halted an alleged active nuclear weapons program in fall 2003. In November 2011, the IAEA reported credible evidence that Iran had been conducting experiments aimed at designing a nuclear bomb until 2003, and that research may have continued on a smaller scale after that time.|$|E
25|$|On 13 May 1964, as Pathet Lao troops {{moved to}} isolate the Neutralist garrisons at Muong Phan and Muong Kheung, a revolt against Kong Le broke out within FAN. His armored commander, Colonel Sourideth, encircled Kong Le's {{headquarters}} with a dozen tanks. The next day, BP 4 went over to Deuane's Patriotic Neutralists. One company of the latter was fighting in an offensive against Royalist regiment Groupement Mobile 17 (Mobile Group 17). Kong Le withdrew FAN from the Plain in good order, except for an inconsequential loss of small arms. However, in June, his armored force of 23 vehicles had to be abandoned at Muong Kheung. However, the American Special National <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Estimate</b> of 5 August 1965 credited the Patriotic Neutralists as an ineffectual force of 2,600 men.|$|E

25|$|In addition, on July 9 AAF intelligence, {{with help}} from the FBI, {{secretly}} began an investigation of the best sightings, mostly from pilots and military personnel. Arnold's sighting, {{as well as that of}} the United Airline's crew, were included in the list of best sightings. Three weeks later they came to the conclusion that the saucer reports were not imaginary or adequately explained by natural phenomena; something real was flying around. This laid the groundwork for another <b>intelligence</b> <b>estimate</b> in September 1947 by Gen. Nathan Twining, commanding officer of the Air Materiel Command, which likewise concluded the saucers were real and urged a formal investigation by multiple government agencies. This in turn resulted in the formation of Project Sign at the end of 1947, the first publicly acknowledged USAF UFO investigation. Project Sign eventually evolved into Project Grudge, and then the better known Project Blue Book.|$|E
500|$|Dissent and {{criticism}} of Bush's {{leadership in the}} War on Terror increased as the war in Iraq continued. In 2006, a National <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Estimate</b> concluded that the Iraq War had become the [...] "cause célèbre for jihadists".|$|E
500|$|This {{case was}} blunted by a 1995 National <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Estimate</b> (NIE), which stated that no country besides the five major nuclear powers {{was capable of}} {{acquiring}} missiles that could reach Canada or the contiguous United States within the ensuing 15 years. Republican lawmakers intent on funding a defensive shield criticized the report and the Clinton administration for inaccurate assessments and distorted intelligence.

50|$|After 1941, G.50s {{played a}} minor {{role in the}} Regia Aeronautica. In June 1942, British <b>intelligence</b> <b>estimated</b> that 12 Gruppo had 26 G.50s (10 serviceable), while the {{backbone}} of 5a Squadra Aerea was 104 C.202s, 63 C.200s, 32 Z.1007 and 31 S.79s.|$|R
500|$|While {{the report}} was being prepared, in August 1957 the Soviets {{launched}} their R-7 Semyorka (SS-6) ICBM, and followed this up with the successful launch of Sputnik 1 in October. Over the next few months, a series of intelligence reviews resulted in ever increasing estimates of the Soviet missile force. National <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Estimate</b> (NIE) 11-10-57, issued in December 1957, stated that the Soviets would have perhaps 10 prototype missiles in service by mid-1958. But after Nikita Khrushchev claimed to be producing them [...] "like sausages", the numbers began to rapidly inflate. NIE 11-5-58, released in August 1958, suggested there would be 100 ICBMs in service by 1960, and 500 by 1961 or 1962 at the latest.|$|E
500|$|The {{findings}} of the commission generated mixed reactions among lawmakers, intelligence officers, and experts. [...] The intelligence community was privately angered by the harsh language the report used to describe their own assessments of the threat, although CIA Director George Tenet did not openly criticize it in public. [...] Congressional proponents of a national missile shield, especially Republicans, used the findings to further push their case that such a shield was necessary. However, some experts {{in and out of}} government questioned the usefulness of the report, saying that it made general speculations without reaching any definite conclusions. [...] Whereas the <b>intelligence</b> <b>estimate</b> focused on what was actually occurring, the commission focused on what might occur. [...] This was labeled in one article [...] "'hypothesis-based' threat assessment".|$|E
500|$|The {{project was}} created after the Central Intelligence Agency's 1957 National <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Estimate</b> 11-5-57, named [...] "Soviet Capabilities and Probable Programs in the Guided Missile Field", {{estimated}} that the Soviet Union {{would be capable of}} having a reconnaissance satellite in space by 1963. The United States Air Force issued General Operational Requirement-170 on 19 June 1958 ordering the development of a system that was capable of destroying a satellite. Then the United States Air Force and Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) commissioned studies by the Space Technology Laboratories and the Radio Corporation of America. The plan for development of the system formulated by the Air Force was shown to the National Security Council on 5 February 1960. On 17 March 1961, the Radio Corporation of America received a grant to develop Project SAINT.|$|E
