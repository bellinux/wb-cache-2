We examine PET filaments industrially extruded from recycled PET bottle flakes with different mechanical properties and profiles. On considering a volumetric fiber dosage at 1 %, we observe marked improvements in thermal resistance, mechanical strengths and ductility of RPETFRC, as compared to plain concrete. A comparative study with earlier literature results indicates that RPETFRC is also highly competitive over polypropylenefiber-reinforced concrete in terms of compressive strength and <b>fracture</b> <b>toughnes...</b>|$|E

40|$|The Vickers {{hardness}} of {{the bulk}} TaB and nano-TaC ceramics sintered at high pressure and high temperature were measured {{by using a}} diamond indentation method. Our tests gave a maximum Vickers hardness of 13. 9 â¯GPa for TaB, and 19. 2 â¯GPa for nano-TaC ceramics under a load of 29. 4 â¯N. The hardness of nano-TaC- 5 â¯wt% Co composites was also measured under the same load for comparison, which {{was found to be}} much lower than that of TaB and nano-TaC. The relative densities calculated by the Archimedes method are 13. 5 â¯g/cm 3 for TaB and 13. 6 â¯g/cm 3 for nano-TaC. The averaged fracture toughness is 6. 8 â¯Â±â¯ 0. 3 â¯MPaâ¯m 1 / 2 for TaB and 5. 0 â¯Â±â¯ 0. 2 â¯MPaâ¯m 1 / 2 for nano-TaC. Our results show that the hardness of the TaB may not be as high as previous reports. Keywords: TaB, TaC, High-pressure, Vickers hardness, <b>Fracture</b> <b>toughnes...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This study aims {{to predict}} the elastic-plastic {{fracture}} toughness of ductile material using Finite element modeling ‘for which we predict the variation of SZW and critical SZW under mix mode condition and we also use mix mode mixidity. In our findings significant variation in the magnitude of critical SZW on the two surfaces were noticed. This is differing in pure mode-I and mode-II. It is due to variation in mode mixidity at different plane levels. Insignificant variations of average critical SZW were observed upto 45 ° (mid thickness) i. e. 45 ° while, after 45 ° significant reduction in average critical SZW value were observed. In addition, the significant change in sharp crack front {{of the magnitude of}} critical SZW on two surfaces were observed. Whereas, these changes were varied at different planes. Besides this, the significant variation of sharp crack front (at mid plane) and deformed blunted crack front at critical load line displacement were also observed. In fine, the linear variation of critical SZW with initial blunted root radius were observed. It is concluded that the proposed method of SZW determination using large deformation FEM analysis can reasonably simulate the process of blunting of the crack tip and can predict the material’s SZW and J-integral value.

40|$|A design {{protocol}} utilizing {{common elements}} for bulk metallic glass formation has been employed to develop novel, low cost Fe-, and Ti- based bulk metallic glasses. A critical obstacle that was successfully overcome {{in this work}} is the omission of beryllium in these alloys. Beryllium is of vital importance in many bulk metallic glass forming systems, but it is expensive and poses considerable health risks. Bulk metallic glasses in these novel Fe-, and Ti-based systems exhibit extremely high mechanical strength and excellent thermal stability. Devitrification and cooling rate experiments were used to identify crystalline phase formation and assess activation energy for crystallization, {{as well as to}} explore and develop ductile BMG composites. To better control microstructure in these BMG composites, a novel processing technique, called semi-solid forging was developed, wherein the alloy melt is heated to above the melt temperature of the glass, but below the melt temperature of the ductile crystalline phase. Such an approach permits the maintenance of a glassy, or nanocrystalline matrix phase, while simultaneously coarsening and homogenizing the ductile, secondary phase. This processing approach leads to enhanced ductility in the alloys, which, to this point, has not been observed using conventional casting methods. The combination of novel, low-cost, alloy compositions with semi-solid forging has been successfully utilized to develop new high strength structural materials with enhanced ductility and toughness. Microstrutural and mechanical properties of these novel, toughened, BMG composites are presented. A comprehensive analysis of the relationship between deformation mechanisms and microstructure reveals that enhanced ductility is predicated on matching fundamental mechanical and microstructural length scales in a Ti-Ni-Si-Mo BMG composite. Under optimized microstructural conditions, a maximum compressive strength exceeding 2400 MPa with ̃ 30 % total strain to failure was achieved. Furthermore, a 400 % increase in fracture toughness over the monolithic glass, and tensile ductility of 3. 5 % were observed. The design of conventional, crystalline, high-performance structural materials is governed by optimizing combinations of mechanical properties such as strength, ductility, toughness, and elasticity. In general though, high strength comes at the expense of ductility. The development of ductile BMG composites represents the dawn of a new era in structural materials that couples ultra high strength with considerable ductility and enhanced <b>fracture</b> <b>toughnes...</b>|$|E
