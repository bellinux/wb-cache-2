5|$|<b>Folding</b> screen: The <b>folding</b> {{screen is}} a type of {{furniture}} consisting of several frames or panels. Screens date back to China during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty period (771–256 BC). These were initially one-panel screens in contrast to <b>folding</b> screens. <b>Folding</b> screens were invented during the Han Dynasty (206 BC - AD 220). Depictions of those <b>folding</b> screens have been found in Han Dynasty era tombs, such as one in Zhucheng, Shandong Province. During the Tang Dynasty, <b>folding</b> screens were considered ideal ornaments for many painters to display their paintings and calligraphy on. Many artists painted on paper or silk and applied it onto the <b>folding</b> screen. The landscape paintings on <b>folding</b> screens reached its height during the Song Dynasty (960–1279).|$|E
5|$|Although Kawasaki's theorem {{completely}} {{describes the}} <b>folding</b> patterns that have flat-folded states, {{it does not}} describe the <b>folding</b> process needed to reach that state. For some <b>folding</b> patterns, {{it may be necessary}} to curve or bend the paper while transforming it from a flat sheet to its flat-folded state, rather than keeping the rest of the paper flat and only changing the dihedral angles at each fold. For rigid origami (a type of <b>folding</b> that keeps the surface flat except at its folds, suitable for hinged panels of rigid material rather than flexible paper), additional conditions are needed on a <b>folding</b> pattern to allow it to move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.|$|E
5|$|The {{simulations}} run on Folding@home {{are used}} in conjunction with laboratory experiments, but researchers can use them to study how <b>folding</b> in vitro differs from <b>folding</b> in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of <b>folding,</b> misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011 Folding@home simulated protein <b>folding</b> inside a ribosomal exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the <b>folding</b> process. Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical denaturants to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, {{and it is difficult to}} experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence <b>folding</b> behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of ProteinL, and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.|$|E

40|$|We review <b>fold</b> usage on {{completed}} genomes {{to explore}} protein structure evolution. The patterns of {{presence or absence}} of <b>folds</b> on genomes gives us insights into the relationships between <b>folds,</b> the age of different <b>folds</b> and how we have arrived at the set of <b>folds</b> we see today. We examine the relationships between different measures which describe protein <b>fold</b> usage, such as the number of copies of a <b>fold</b> per genome, the number of families per <b>fold,</b> and the number of genomes a <b>fold</b> occurs on. We obtained these measures of <b>fold</b> usage by searching for the structural domains on 157 completed genome sequences from all three kingdoms of life. In our comparisons of these measures we found that bacteria have relatively more distinct <b>folds</b> on their genomes than archaea. Eukaryotes were found to have many more copies of a <b>fold</b> on their genomes. If we separate out the different <b>fold</b> classes, the alpha/beta class has relatively fewer distinct <b>folds</b> on large genomes, more copies of a <b>fold</b> on bacteria and more <b>folds</b> occurring in all three kingdoms simultaneously. These results possibly indicate that most alpha/beta <b>folds</b> originated earlier than other <b>folds.</b> The expected power law distribution is observed for copies of a <b>fold</b> per genome and we found a similar distribution for the number of families per <b>fold.</b> However, a more complicated distribution appears for <b>fold</b> occurrence across genomes, which strongly depends on <b>fold</b> class and kingdom. We also show {{that there is not a}} clear relationship between the three measures of <b>fold</b> usage. A <b>fold</b> which occurs on many genomes does not necessarily have many copies on each genome. Similarly, <b>folds</b> with many copies do not necessarily have many families or vice versa...|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of proteins' conformation or configuration space (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds, before 2010 simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales. General-purpose supercomputers have been used to simulate protein <b>folding,</b> but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong scaling of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult. Moreover, as protein <b>folding</b> is a stochastic process and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the <b>folding</b> process.|$|E

5|$|Proteins are an {{essential}} component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within biological cells. They often act as enzymes, performing biochemical reactions including cell signaling, molecular transportation, and cellular regulation. As structural elements, some proteins act {{as a type of}} skeleton for cells, and as antibodies, while other proteins participate in the immune system. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional three-dimensional structure, a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its amino acid sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein <b>folding</b> is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its native state. Thus, understanding protein <b>folding</b> is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a holy grail of computational biology. Despite <b>folding</b> occurring within a crowded cellular environment, it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may misfold, that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold misfolded proteins, they can subsequently aggregate and cause a variety of debilitating diseases. Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein <b>folding,</b> misfolding, and aggregation.|$|E
