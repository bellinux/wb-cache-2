25|$|The architects {{wanted the}} {{building}} to give Bloomington residents {{the feeling that the}} courthouse belonged to them. To encourage this feeling the entrances on all four sides of the building are identical, a way to welcome people from all directions. Wanting to balance the feeling of symmetry with a sense of power Reeves and Baile created an identical hierarchy in each facade through the use of an entrance arch, enhanced vertically by columns and topped off with a pediment. The exterior also makes use of many balustrades in the roof and other levels on the exterior. Also included are detailed egg-and-dart molding, and <b>hood</b> <b>molding.</b>|$|E
25|$|VAM's {{decision}} to focus all {{efforts on the}} new two-version Lerma model plus the loss of luxury accessories meant the discontinuation of Rally SST for 1982. The loss of the exemption of 500 units of automobile engines without emission certification forced the retirement of the Rally GT. The only model left for 1982 was the Rally AMX, with substantial differences from the previous two years. The taillight surrounding areas plus the headlight bezels and front <b>hood</b> <b>molding</b> were completely blacked out, the last two parts also having a horizontal red stripe passing from edge to edge. An all-new grille design with a horizontal bar {{at the same height}} of the bezels' division between the parking lights and headlights and a vertical bar at the very center; behind these was a set of smaller narrower horizontal lines. Both bumpers for the year were those of the AMC Eagle SX/4 Sport, being blacked out equipped with thick nerfing strips with central bright moldings and longer more aerodynamic bumper end caps with their respective bright molding. Unlike the previous two years, no decals or stickers of any kind were used. The standard wheel designs for the year were the eight spoke steel units with blacked out volcano hubcaps. Due to the impossibility of having the bullet-type door mirrors reproduced, the model switched to sporty design that was used in the 1978â€“1980 models. However, the remote controls for these mirrors while still available were moved to the option list. The Recaro-type seats received new patterns with a smaller bucket shape to allow an easier {{in and out of the}} car in the driver's side (due to the lack of a tilt steering column). The door panels were the same units as in 1981 except for the change in the fabric portion from plain to a pattern of vertical stripes and the removal of a fake chrome molding in place of a woodgrain unit. The six-bolt sports steering wheel was replaced by a leather-wrapped three-arm Nardi unit. VAM managed to find a local company to reproduce the center console, but it was reduced to the shifter and gauges portions, deleting the armrest with the rear ashtray. Despite the loss in accessories, two new options arrived for the year in the form of the AM FM stereo tape player radio and the rear wiper and washer. The car received two changes in the mid year, the first being a new wooden sports steering wheel and the second a new set of ten-round-spoke steel wheels. Mechanically, the only novelties for the year were wider gear ratios for the A998 automatic transmission and in the mid year a new head design with rounded internal intake ports and smaller spark plug outlets, still retaining the metal valve cover of the previous years. A different head gasket was used to bring the compression ratio from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1.|$|E

5000|$|Born near Tiffin, Ohio in 1830, Joseph R. Bartlett {{moved to}} Lower Sandusky (now Fremont) in 1833 with his family.

By the early 1870s, {{he and his wife}} Rachel had become sufficiently prosperous to erect a grand house on Park Avenue south of the Sandusky County Courthouse. [...] Choosing limestone for the foundation, weatherboarding for the walls, and an asphalt roof, the Bartletts arranged for the construction of an ornate house that mixed elements of the Italianate and Second Empire styles of architecture. [...] Many distinctive architectural elements characterize their house, including peaked dormers on the mansard roof, a large tower on one corner, ornate carvings on the porch, detailed <b>hood</b> <b>molding,</b> and an elaborate set of carvings and plaster work on the interior. Even the doorways are distinctive: few Fremont houses feature an entrance through a corner tower in the manner of the Bartlett House.|$|E

In place of <b>hood</b> <b>molds,</b> which were typical of the Italianate, each window has a heavy rusticated stone lintel. The metal cornice {{across the top of}} the facade is simpler in its decorative elements than earlier Italianate cornices.

On the second level of the two end bays are three-sectioned windows in the Palladian motif. The east and west facades are similar, both being four bays wide and having arched windows. On the east front, however, a five-sectioned oriel bay was placed on the first story which is partially blocked by a frame wing added circa 1912.

After {{approximately}} $5,000 had been spent to complete it, {{the building was}} dedicated on Thanksgiving Day 1886 by William Henry Elder, the Archbishop of Cincinnati. Built of brick on a brick foundation and highlighted with stone elements, the church is a three-story building with a composite roof that rises in a gable. Numerous details produce a distinctive Gothic Revival appearance, including the ogive-arched windows and their stone <b>hood</b> <b>molds</b> and the arched bay surrounding the entrance and transom. When these elements combine with non-Gothic components such as the steeple and the brackets under the cornice, {{the result is an}} architectural landmark in a street otherwise filled with houses.
