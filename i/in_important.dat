This includes his reluctance to resolve a dispute between Leonidas Polk, a personal friend, and Braxton Bragg, who was defeated <b>in</b> <b>important</b> battles and distrusted by his subordinates. He was similarly reluctant to relieve the capable but overcautious Joseph E. Johnston until, after numerous frustrations which he detailed in a March 1, 1865 letter to Col. James Phelan of Mississippi, he replaced him with John Bell Hood.|$|E

5|$|Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain is a 2014 {{historical}} drama film set {{amidst the}} Bhopal disaster {{that had occurred}} in India on 2–3 December 1984.

Benjamin Wallfisch composed the film's music. Kumar got {{the idea of making}} a film based on the Bhopal disaster after he read a book based on it. Shot over a period of 18 months, it was originally slated for a late 2010 release. However, the lack of responses from distributors kept on delaying the release.|$|E

Later that month, Fidel called into Hugo Chávez's radio show Aló Presidente. On April 21, Castro met Wu Guanzheng of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo, with Chávez visiting in August, and Morales in September. That month, the Non-Aligned Movement held its 14th Summit in Havana, there agreeing to appoint Castro as the organisation's president for a year's term.|$|E
5|$|Construction for the Independência (officially Estádio Raimundo Sampaio) {{started in}} 1947 in {{preparation}} for the 1950 FIFA World Cup, during which its first match was played. Originally the property of the State Government of Minas Gerais, ownership was transferred to Sete de Setembro FC in 1965, when the Mineirão was built, and the property passed to América in 1997, when it absorbed Sete de Setembro. Before the Mineirão, the stadium was the largest in Belo Horizonte — holding up to 30,000 people — and was preferred by Atlético over the older and smaller Antônio Carlos stadium. After the Mineirão's construction, however, Atlético did not use the Estádio do Horto (as it is also known) for decades, except for a brief spell in the late 1990s. The stadium was renovated in 2012, while the Mineirão was closed, having its capacity reduced to 23,018. In that year, Atlético announced a deal with BWA Arenas, the stadium manager. The club signed a contract to use the Independência as its home ground for 10 years, which has happened since then, except <b>in</b> <b>important</b> and high-attendance matches.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Ramesses XI in 1078BC, Smendes assumed {{authority}} over {{the northern part of}} Egypt, ruling from the city of Tanis. The south was effectively controlled by the High Priests of Amun at Thebes, who recognized Smendes in name only. During this time, Berber tribes from what was later to be called Libya had been settling in the western delta, and the chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy. Libyan princes took control of the delta under Shoshenq I in 945BC, founding the Libyan Berber, or Bubastite, dynasty that ruled for some 200 years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members <b>in</b> <b>important</b> priestly positions.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} {{out from her}} {{participation}} in the Revising Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian teaching that women were the source of sin, and that sex was sinful. Gage wrote that the double standard for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed {{from most of the}} women on the Revising Committee in that she did not feel that the Bible, once interpreted in a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined that the Church had acted against women's interests <b>in</b> <b>important</b> ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially troubling to Gage was the story of Adam and Eve.|$|E

On 2 November {{the battalion}} supported the final breakthrough by Allied forces that decided the outcome of the battle. Casualties were high during this time and three of its commanding officers were either killed or wounded between July and November 1942. Nevertheless, the battalion remained in the fighting and in March 1943, at Medenine it undertook a defensive role before switching to the offensive at Point 209 in the Tebaga Gap, where it was responsible for almost completely destroying a German panzer grenadier battalion. It was during this action that Second Lieutenant Moana-Nui-a-Kiwa Ngarimu performed the deeds that led to him being posthumously decorated with the Victoria Cross. The battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Bennett, also received the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership during the attack.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, King James became {{increasingly}} unpopular in England. He alienated otherwise supportive Tories with {{his attempts to}} relax the Penal Laws, and he issued the Declaration of Indulgence in 1687, which established some freedom of religion, a move opposed by the Anglican church hierarchy. He increased {{the power of the}} regular army, an action seen by many Parliamentarians as a threat to their authority, and placed Catholics <b>in</b> <b>important</b> military positions. James also attempted to place sympathizers in Parliament who he hoped would repeal the Test Act, which required a strict Anglican religious test for many civil offices. Some Whigs and Tories set aside their political differences when his son and potential successor James was born in June 1688, and they conspired to replace him with his Protestant son-in-law William, Prince of Orange. The Dutch prince had tried fruitlessly to get James to reconsider his policies; he agreed to an invasion, and the nearly bloodless revolution that followed in November and December 1688 established William and his wife Mary as co-rulers.|$|E
5|$|Modi {{became an}} RSS sambhag pracharak (regional organiser) in 1978, {{overseeing}} RSS {{activities in the}} areas of Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979 he {{went to work for the}} RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS's version of the history of the Emergency. He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985. In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi's planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers. After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members <b>in</b> <b>important</b> positions within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.|$|E
