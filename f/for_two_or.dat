5|$|Community ecology is {{the study}} of the {{interactions}} among a collections of species that inhabit the same geographic area.

Research in community ecology might measure species diversity in grasslands in relation to soil fertility. It might also include the analysis of predator-prey dynamics, competition among similar plant species, or mutualistic interactions between crabs and corals.|$|E

It may be related to services commonly being withdrawn after this period, rather than any physiological limitation to further progress. Children recover better in the immediate time frame and improve for longer periods.|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s, Edward was {{a regular}} habitué of Parisian brothels, most notably Le Chabanais, which was {{regarded}} as the top establishment in Paris where brothels were legal.

The typical lifespan is five years, but an age of over 18 years has been recorded for a wild tawny owl, and of over 27years for a captive bird.|$|E

5|$|A deck {{decompression}} chamber (DDC), or double-lock chamber is a two compartment {{pressure vessel}} for human occupation which has sufficient space in the main chamber <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more occupants, and a forechamber which can allow a person to be pressurised or decompressed while the main chamber remains under constant pressure. This allows an attendant to be locked in or out during treatment of the occupant(s) of the main chamber. There is usually also a medical lock, which serves a similar function but is much smaller. This is used to transfer medical material, food and specimens {{into and out of}} the main chamber while it is under pressure. Most {{deck decompression chamber}}s are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathig gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E
5|$|After World War II, a large, undeveloped hill {{owned by}} the {{university}} was used to house returning veterans in military-style campus housing.

There are also three small residence halls which feature open doubles. South Campus {{is also home to}} the Institute for Sensory Research, Tennity Ice Pavilion, Goldstein Student Center, Skytop Office Building and 621 Skytop Road (for administration), and the InnComplete Pub, a graduate student bar. Just north is the headquarters of SU Athletics, Manley Field House, located in the Manley Athletics Complex. Approximately 2,500 students live on the South Campus, which is connected to the main campus by frequent bus service.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{estimates}} that Yorktown, damaged in the Battle of the Coral Sea, would require {{several months of}} repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, her elevators were intact and her flight deck largely so.

5|$|<b>For</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three days, Rome {{remained}} {{without an}} emperor. By April 11, Macrinus had proclaimed himself emperor and assumed {{all of the}} imperial titles and powers, without waiting for the Senate. The army backed his claim as emperor and the Senate, so far away, was powerless to intervene. Macrinus never returned to Rome as emperor and remained based in Antioch {{for the duration of}} his reign. Macrinus was the first emperor to hail from the equestrian class, rather than the senatorial and also the first emperor of Mauretanian descent. He adopted the name of Severus, in honor of the Severan dynasty, and conferred the imperial title of Augusta to his wife Nonia Celsa and the title of Caesar and name of Antoninus to his son Diadumenianus in honor of the Antonine dynasty, thus making him second in command. At the time of Diadumenian's accession he was eight years old.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that, in 12 workers exposed <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm {{has been reported}}. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of {{the skin of the}} hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).|$|E
5|$|Jonathan T. Leete had captained the {{schooner}} Reaper, {{owned by}} James Frisbie, and crewed {{by a man}} of East Asian origin, John Canoe, commonly known as Jackalow, short for John Low or John Lord. After Jonathan gave up command of the Reaper, he and Jackalow worked on Jonathan's father's farm on Sachem's Head in Guilford, Connecticut, where Jackalow was regarded as family. At some point, while in New York, Jackalow had stolen $100 from Jonathan and fled to New Haven. He was returned to New York by the police, but Jonathan refused to testify against him and rehired him. Jonathan and his brother Elijah J. Leete subsequently bought the 30-ton sloop Spray, {{funded in part by}} a mortgage their father took out on his farm. Jonathan (the captain), Elijah, and Jackalow sailed the Spray together <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three years. By March 1860, Jackalow had sailed with Jonathan for four years.|$|E

5|$|Kieswetter {{was born}} in Johannesburg to an Afrikaner father, Wayne, and Scottish mother, Belinda.

Kieswetter was {{disappointed}} when he was asked to play club cricket <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three seasons before returning to play for the senior team; he never received an explanation and decided instead to pursue a cricket career in England, where he moved at the age of 18. He studied for his A-levels for a year at Millfield, where Mark Davis, a former Somerset bowler, spotted him. He was quickly signed by Somerset. At the 2006 Under-19s World Cup in Sri Lanka, he represented South Africa and won a Man of the Match award in a game against the United States for his innings of 80 off 66 balls.|$|E
5|$|Many {{writers in}} the early 20th century perpetuated a myth that Thespis ran only a month and was {{considered}} a failure. In fact, it remained open until 8 March. Of the nine London pantomimes that appeared during the 1871–72 holiday season, five closed before Thespis did. By its nature, the genre did not lend itself to long runs, and all nine had closed {{by the end of}} March. Moreover, the Gaiety normally only ran productions <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three weeks; the run of Thespis was extraordinary for the theatre.|$|E
5|$|Most farming {{was based}} on the lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, {{settlements}} of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers. They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset some of the problems of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective in heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for ploughing the lord's land on an annual basis and the much resented obligation to grind corn at the lord's mill.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the early}} modern population, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small hamlets and {{isolated}} dwellings. Most farming {{was based on the}} lowland fermtoun or highland baile, settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable <b>for</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> three plough teams. As the population expanded, some of these settlements were sub-divided to create new hamlets and more marginal land was settled, with sheilings (clusters of huts occupied while summer pasture was being used for grazing), becoming permanent settlements. The standard layout of a house throughout Scotland before agricultural improvement was a byre-dwelling or long house or blackhouse with humans and livestock sharing a common roof, often separated by only a partition wall, leading to the byre (barn) Contemporaries noted that cottages in the Highlands and Islands tended to be cruder, with single rooms, slit windows and earthen floors, often shared by a large family. In contrast, many Lowland cottages had distinct rooms and chambers, were clad with plaster or paint and even had glazed windows.|$|E
