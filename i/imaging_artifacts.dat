40|$|Objective. Real-time 3 -dimensional (3 D) {{ultrasound}} imaging {{has the potential}} to become a dominant imaging technique for minimally invasive surgery. One barrier to its widespread use is that surgical instruments generate <b>imaging</b> <b>artifacts,</b> which can obfuscate their location, orientation, and geometry and obscure nearby tissue. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify and describe the types of artifacts which could be produced by metallic instruments during interventions guided by 3 D ultrasound imag-ing. Methods. Three imaging studies were performed. First, <b>imaging</b> <b>artifacts</b> from stainless steel rods were identified in vitro and acoustically characterized. Second, 3 typical minimally invasive instruments were imaged (in vitro and in vivo), and their artifacts were analyzed. The third study compared the intensity of <b>imaging</b> <b>artifacts</b> (in vitro and in vivo) from stainless steel rods with rods composed of 3 dif-ferent materials and stainless steel rods with roughened and coated surfaces. Results. For the stainless steel rods, all observed artifacts are described and illustrated, and their physical origins are explained. Artifacts from the 3 minimally invasive instruments are characterized with the use of the artifacts observed with the rods. Finally, it is shown that artifacts can be greatly reduced through the use of alternate materials or by surface modification. Conclusions.

40|$|FCM {{is one of}} a {{conventional}} clustering method and has been generally applied for medical image segmentation.

The proposed algorithm is applied to both artificial synthesized image and real image.

40|$|Abstract—Three-dimensional {{ultrasound}} {{has been}} an effective imaging modality for diagnostics and is now an emerging modality for image-guided minimally-invasive interventions since it enables visualization of both instruments and tissue. Challenges to ultrasound-guided interventions arise, however, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the <b>imaging</b> <b>artifacts</b> created by the interventional instruments. Metallic instruments, in particular, are strong scatters and so produce a variety of artifacts.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Optimized fast spin-echo imaging was compared with fast spin-echo and HASTE imaging, for both image quality and ability to assess the zonal anatomy of the uterus, in 40 volunteers. In optimized fast spin-echo imaging, the imaging time was reduced using partial-Fourier reconstruction, reducing the echo spacing, and increasing the echo train length.
