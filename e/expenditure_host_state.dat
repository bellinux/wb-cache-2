40|$|A <b>host</b> <b>state</b> {{has become}} a victim of “fair and {{equitable}} treatment” investment standard offered to the foreign investment protection. Foreign investment dissatisfied with <b>host</b> <b>state</b> legitimate public measures affecting their investment demand FET protection alleging investment protection violation. Foreign investors strong pitching for FET standard protection subordinating every sovereign <b>host</b> <b>state</b> regulatory action is creating friction between the parties. While <b>host</b> <b>state</b> insists non-discriminatory police power inherited in FET regulation for public measures, in contrast, foreign investors demand absolute protection of foreign investment. Emerging and developing host country were early targets of foreign investment. A capital export from developed source state to emerging and developing <b>host</b> <b>state</b> is not anymore unidirectional but bidirectional. The investment from emerging and developing economies to developed countries are in rapid increase. Earlier emerging and developing host country were in voracious attack from established source state foreign investors. These suffering <b>host</b> <b>states</b> were fighting for their sovereign rights to regulate for public protection and interests, however, no to avail. Developed source state supporting implicitly for their investor’s investment protection became a victim of themselves. Rules applied to other became a loop to themselves whom they are now fighting to defend <b>host</b> <b>state</b> administrative rights for the public purpose. The absolute FET has become more fickle {{and in a way}} of balancing stage recognising outstanding and value of regulatory rights in FET. My dissertation explores on the same line that FET protection standard for foreign investors and their investment is reciprocal to <b>host</b> <b>state</b> just and equitable regulatory public measures. <b>Host</b> <b>state</b> non-discriminatory measures are non-compensable and legitimate of sovereign rights when public protection and security demands. This adduces long believed and practiced <b>host</b> <b>state</b> necessary steps of domestic law and order. It is evidence by Modern Model BIT, in arbitration practices and even developed source states opposing absolute FET standard protection. These methods proved that predatory nature of alleging FET violations are not only harming host country but also negativity in foreign investors and their investment. The future is not about only <b>host</b> <b>state</b> rights regulatory measures but also foreign investors and their investment self-regulatory measures like corporate social responsibility...|$|R
40|$|The United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) {{has begun}} to face {{increasingly}} serious challenges to its missions {{in the form of}} withdrawn <b>host</b> <b>state</b> consent. As these situations bring to light the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the UN’s peacekeeping structure, it has become apparent that the Department must enact changes in its policies in order to prevent withdrawal of <b>host</b> <b>state</b> consent in future missions. <b>Host</b> <b>state</b> challenges to consent not only threaten the lives of UN peacekeepers and jeopardize the investment that Member States have chosen to make in the <b>host</b> <b>state,</b> but they also fundamentally endanger the legitimacy of United Nations peacekeeping as a security tool of the international community; without <b>host</b> <b>state</b> consent, UN missions would be engaging in peace enforcement rather than peacekeeping. This policy brief sets out the primary challenges faced in acquiring and maintaining <b>host</b> <b>state</b> consent. It is essential that the following issues be addressed by DPKO policies in order to avoid crises of consent in United Nations peacekeeping missions: •	The failure to translate states’ official agreements into action on the ground due to a disconnect between the UN’s operational and strategic levels of interaction with the <b>host</b> <b>state</b> government; •	A decrease in UN influence over the host country government as the peacekeeping operation (PKO) progresses in its mandate; •	The sacrifice of key aspects of UN PKOs in order to acquire consent in instances of humanitarian necessity; and •	The political nature of the mission’s interaction with the <b>host</b> <b>state</b> government and the subordinate position of the PKO to the <b>host</b> <b>state</b> in consent-based peacekeeping. The above-stated obstacles are exhibited in three recent consent-based crises in the Sudan, Chad, and Eritrea. With these case studies in mind, this brief outlines the following policy recommendations that would strengthen DPKO’s capabilities for maintaining <b>host</b> <b>state</b> consent: •	Explicitly <b>stated</b> incentives for <b>host</b> states’ cooperation and consent; •	Supportive diplomatic structures to maintain the engagement and coordination of relevant actors and provide a unified front from which to demand continued consent; and •	Detailed, realistic contingency planning for situations where consent-based issues are likely to occur. The United Nations and its Member States have an interest in ensuring that peacekeeping operations are not placed at the mercy of <b>host</b> <b>state</b> governments. As such DPKO must work towards ensuring that it has a range of strategies for situations where the withdrawal of <b>host</b> <b>state</b> consent is an obstacle to the successful continuation of a peacekeeping mission...|$|R

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{strategic}} {{explanation for the}} USA's continued provision of military aid to <b>host</b> <b>states</b> with problems of terrorism, despite its poor empirical record. Using a game theoretic model, I demonstrate that US military aid creates a moral hazard problem. If <b>host</b> <b>states</b> are provided with the tools to pacify their territory only if terrorist campaigns are ongoing, but will lose this aid once the problem of terrorism ceases, <b>host</b> <b>states</b> {{have little incentive to}} accelerate the demise of terrorist groups. However, the model demonstrates that while military aid does not accomplish the US goal of disarming terrorists, military aid is effective at preventing <b>host</b> <b>states</b> from negotiating with terrorist organizations. The provision of military aid provides a disincentive for <b>host</b> <b>states</b> to reach a negotiated settlement with terrorist groups, and therefore prevents terrorist organizations from altering the status quo that is favorable to the USA. This suggests that while military aid may not be effective at actually disarming terrorist groups, it can be effective at keeping terrorist groups out of power. These hypotheses are tested using the Jones & Libicki (2008) data on terrorism from 1997 to 2006. The empirical results support the conclusions of the theoretical model. conflict, military aid, terrorism...|$|R

This article argues that the rules created by BITs are comparable with and stand parallel to the rules created by the domestic laws of <b>host</b> <b>States</b> and BIT arbitral tribunals should balance these rights when they conflict with each other. BIT arbitral tribunals act as de facto courts since they enforce rights that are assertable against the public at large and not against the <b>host</b> <b>State</b> alone.

40|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} in the mining and oil industries is invariably fostered through the signing of concession agreements between the <b>host</b> <b>State</b> and the investor. Such concessions may contain fiscal incentives, to encourage the flow of FDI. However, such concessions are also susceptible to alteration by the <b>host</b> <b>State,</b> once the investment has been sunk. This may include increasing taxes or outright nationalization. To avert this, investors will often insist on the insertion of stabilization clauses. These clauses constitute an undertaking {{on the part of}} the <b>host</b> <b>State,</b> that they will not take any administrative or legislative action that would adversely affect the rights of the investor. Such clauses are well recognized by arbitral tribunals and the unilateral abrogation of these clauses, will have pecuniary consequences. Not only will the <b>host</b> <b>State</b> have to pay damnum emergens but also lucrum cessans as part of the compensation package to the investor. Such a position promotes efficiency as per the efficient breach theory, by discouraging the State from terminating concession agreements unless they will make some money, even after compensating the investor for lost future profits. However, this ultimately renders stabilization clauses inflexible because they preclude the <b>host</b> <b>State</b> from pursuing legitimate public functions. Such a position, necessitates some form of contractual flexibility. However, the legitimate expectations of the investor also ought to the protected. The means of achieving this balance is by the inserting renegotiation clauses in the concession agreements...|$|R
