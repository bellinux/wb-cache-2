This study investigated the transactional associations between adolescents’ behavioral <b>engagement,</b> peer <b>status</b> (likeability and popularity), and (positive and negative) teacher–student relationships during secondary education. A large sample of adolescents was followed from Grade 7 to 11 (N = 1116; 49 % female; M age = 13. 79 years). Multivariate autoregressive cross-lagged modeling revealed only unidirectional effects from teacher–student relationships and peer status on students’ behavioral engagement. Positive teacher–student relationships were associated with more behavioral engagement over time, whereas negative teacher–student relationships, higher likeability and higher popularity were related to less behavioral engagement over time.

40|$|This paper investigates how a robot {{that can}} produce {{contingent}} listener response, i. e., backchannel, can deeply engage children as a storyteller. We propose a backchannel opportunity prediction (BOP) model trained from a dataset of children's dyad storytelling and listening activities. Using this dataset, we gain better understanding of what speaker cues children can decode to find backchannel timing, and what type of nonverbal behaviors they produce to indicate <b>engagement</b> <b>status</b> as a listener. Applying our BOP model, we conducted two studies, within- and between-subjects, using our social robot platform, Tega. Behavioral and self-reported analyses from the two studies consistently suggest that children are more engaged with a contingent backchanneling robot listener. Children perceived the contingent robot as more attentive and more interested in their story compared to a non-contingent robot. We find that children significantly gaze more at the contingent robot while storytelling and speak more with higher energy to a contingent robot...|$|E

Three research questions guided this investigation: 1) were there any differences between the clients who became engaged with services, {{and those who did}} not? 2) What were the significant predictors that differentiated both groups of clients? 3) Were those predictors mediated by whom the client saw during their initial contact with the agency? ^ The study sample included 453 black and Hispanic adult clients who accessed ambulatory and support services between calendar years 2003 and 2007. The Health Care Engagement Model adapted from the PRECEDE component of Green and Kreuter 2 ̆ 7 s (2005) program planning model, and the Needs component of Rosenstock (1974) Health Belief Model was developed, and used as the conceptual framework to guide the study. The HCEM consisted of four latent predictor domains (predisposing, enabling, reinforcing and health care needs), two contextual domains (initial point of entry and geographical accessibility) and the outcome variable <b>engagement</b> <b>status.</b> The results revealed that significant differences existed between engaged and non-engaged clients with respect to the predictor and contextual domains of the Health Care Engagement Model. Baron 2 ̆ 6 Kenny 2 ̆ 7 s (1986) steps for mediation analysis were used to examine whether the observed significant predictors were affected by whom clients saw during the initial contact with the agency. The result showed that prior use of support services, willingness to disclose and documentation of laboratory tests results were significantly mediated by whether clients saw an infectious disease specialist at the initial point of entry. However, after controlling for the initial contact, prior use of support services, willingness to disclose and documentation of laboratory test results remained significant. The results of the study showed the usefulness of the Health Care Engagement Model as predicting health care <b>engagement</b> <b>status</b> as well as a predictive tool to guide the development of new program initiatives or modification of existing HIV/AIDS programs that are specific to the unique needs of the individuals, organizations, and communities of interests. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} an attempt to explore how {{important}} points are highlighted in Persian academic lectures. More specifically, this paper was aimed to reach a taxonomy of importance markers based on (a) the discourse functions of importance markers, and (b) the relative position of the importance marker to the highlighted discourse. A mixed-methods (exploratory) approach and a corpus-driven method were used to extract importance markers from 60 lectures of the Persian SOKHAN corpus. In terms of discourse functions, importance marking was found to be done by a set of five discourse functions, i. e. discourse organization, audience <b>engagement,</b> subject <b>status,</b> topic treatment, and relating to exam. Among these, audience engagement was the first most frequently used discourse function. Additionally, in terms of the position of the highlighted discourse, eight patterns were found for anaphoric importance marking. Ten patterns were also found for cataphoric importance marking. Moreover, cataphoric importance markers were considerably more prevalent than anaphoric importance markers. Generally, the findings suggested that lecturers are more inclined to function interpersonally in Persian academic contexts. The paper ends with pedagogical implications...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project aims {{to clarify the}} factors that impact successful aging in Assisted Living facilities (ALFs) in Denton County, Texas. We hypothesize that social disengagement decreases physical and mental components of quality of life. This exploratory {{research project}} employed standardized questionnaires to assess residents in the following domains; HRQOL, social <b>engagement</b> <b>status,</b> level of cognition, depression, {{and the level of}} functioning. This study collected data from 75 participants living in five ALFs. The average of Physical Component Scale (PCS) and Mental Component Scale (MCS) was 35. 33, and 53. 62 respectively. None of the participants had five or more social contacts out of facilities, and two-third of them had two or less social contacts. On average, those participants who were more socially engaged had higher score of MCS compared with disengaged counterparts. The level of physical function significantly affects social engagement, when people with more disabilities {{are more likely to be}} socially disengaged. Social engagement and depression significantly impact MCS, when depression is a mediating factor between social engagement and mental component of quality of life. Considering the expansion in aging population in the United States within the next three decades, the demand for high quality long-term care will skyrocket consequently. This study reveals that external social engagement can sustain HRQOL of residents in assisted living facilities...|$|E

In a Virtual Reality environment that employs camera sensors to recognize human activities, we have to know when user intends to perform an action and when not. Without a proper algorithm for recognizing <b>engagement</b> <b>status,</b> any kind of activities could be interpreted as manipulating actions, called "Midas Touch" problem. Baseline approach for solving this problem is activating gesture recognition system using some focus gestures such as waiving or raising hand. However, a desirable natural user interface should be able to understand user's mental status automatically. In this paper, a novel multi-modal model for engagement detection, DAIA, is presented. using DAIA, the spectrum of mental status for performing an action is quantized in a finite number of engagement states. For this purpose, a Finite State Transducer (FST) is designed. This engagement framework shows how to integrate multi-modal information from user biometric data streams such as 2 D and 3 D imaging. FST is employed to make the state transition smoothly using combination of several boolean expressions. Our FST true detection rate is 92. 3 % in total for four different states.

Inclusion of participants was defined in terms of presence, voice and being heard. Transcripts of the audio-visual recordings of the proceedings were the main data of analysis. By focusing on the talk within these deliberative forums, the study looked at how the rules of <b>engagement</b> and <b>status</b> (ascribed and achieved) differences between participants can affect inclusion. The analysis did not reveal any substantial effects of ascribed characteristics on deliberation. Facilitation and the presence of expertise among the participants were found to influence inclusion and equality among participants. These findings suggest that organizers and facilitators of deliberative exercises have to be reflexive of their role as well as aware of the group dynamics. The results also address the larger questions within science and technology policy like the role of expertise and the public in decision making, the institutional design of participatory exercises, and their relation to the political culture and the policy process.

The current collective <b>engagement</b> <b>status</b> is a major concern and there are no indications that the major collective engagement stakeholders are taking strides or making strategic changes towards harmonious labour relations, especially in the mining sector. If the situation is left unattended, the Marikana experience will repeat itself. Critical to the change management process is a strategy review, improvement for better labour relations and creating a harmonious employee-employer environment in the mining sector. Empirical research was conducted to explore whether the key collective engagement stakeholders at Kumba Iron Ore Mine have a sound strategy for creating harmonious labour relations between employees and management. The qualitative research method was used with the semi-structured interview instrument for data collection. Participants included shop stewards, trade union officials, labour relations professionals, labour law experts and employer representatives. Data was analysed using ATLAS ti software, version 7. The outcome of the study was the identification of seven second-order themes, obtained from the perspective of different stakeholders. These are: structured and purposeful engagements; outcome-driven strategy; trustworthy collective engagement process; mutual desire for peaceful collective engagement process; objective approach; ideological differences; and considerate collective engagements. Recommendations are made to legislation, trade unions, and employers, where it is suggested that a collaborative approach in strategy setting is adopted to map out a more harmonious employment relations future for union-employer relations and partnerships...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a tentative grounded theory, which can provide some explanation {{of variation in}} behaviour around predictive genetic testing (PGT) for Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC), {{based on interviews with}} individuals (n = 55) from families with a clinical diagnosis of HNPCC, 12 of whom were followed through the PGT protocol. The theory is built around a core category of engagement, a newly constructed concept reflecting the degree of cognitive and emotional involvement with cancer risk in individuals from these families, and models the psychosocial process of engaging with cancer risk. The degree of engagement at the time of testing can explain variations in approaches and reactions to PGT. A series of social factors, many related to the experiences of family life, emerged as either facilitating or blocking the process of engaging with cancer risk; a series of psychological factors emerged as interacting in a recursive, dynamic manner {{with each other and with}} <b>engagement</b> <b>status.</b> The degree of engagement can change with the unfolding of time and events in family life. The theory of engagement (TE) provides an explanatory framework for understanding behaviour related to PGT for HNPCC, and can potentially be applied to research on risk perception in the social sciences more generally. In addition, the theory may have potential uses in the genetics clinic, in identifying individuals at risk of adverse reactions to PGT for cancer, thus enabling better targeting of genetic counselling resources...|$|E
40|$|We {{advocate}} for and introduce LEARNSense, {{a framework for}} learning analytics using commodity wearable devices to capture learner’s physical actions and accordingly infer learner context (e. g., student activities and <b>engagement</b> <b>status</b> in class). Our work is motivated by the observations that: (a) the fine-grained individual-specific learner actions are crucial to understand learners and their context information; (b) sensor data available on the latest wearable devices (e. g., wrist-worn and eye wear devices) can effectively recognize learner actions and help to infer learner context information; (c) the commodity wearable devices that are widely available on the market can provide a hassle-free and non-intrusive solution. Following the above observations and under the proposed framework, we design and implement a sensor-based learner context collector running on the wearable devices. The latest data mining and sensor data processing techniques are employed to detect different types of learner actions and context information. Furthermore, we detail {{all of the above}} efforts by offering a novel and exemplary use case: it successfully provides the accurate detection of student actions and infers the student engagement states in class. The specifically designed learner context collector has been implemented on the commodity wrist-worn device. Based on the collected and inferred learner information, the novel intervention and incentivizing feedback are introduced into the system service. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation with the real-world experiments, surveys and interviews demonstrates the effectiveness and impact of the proposed framework and this use case. The F 1 score for the student action classification tasks achieve 0. 9, and the system can effectively differentiate the defined three learner states.

40|$|Although {{substantial}} {{work has}} been done regarding the effectiveness of social emotional learning (SEL) programming at the elementary level, additional research is needed at the secondary level to investigate factors that impact program implementation and effectiveness within middle school contexts. These factors include classroom structures and teachers’ and students’ characteristics. In this dissertation, a mixed methods case study design was employed to investigate the roles teachers’ characteristics, beliefs, and attitudes play in the implementation of a school-wide SEL approach known as Developmental Designs (DD). This teaching approach specifically addresses the need for relationship- and community-building practices in middle school classrooms through teacher professional development. Classroom observations were matched with teacher interviews to place 24 middle school teachers, identifying as 60 % male, 78 % white, 18 % African American, and 5 % Latino, into one of four typologies: · low-implementing teachers with highly engaged classrooms · low-implementing teachers with low-engaged classrooms · high-implementing teachers with highly engaged classrooms · high-implementing teachers with low-engaged classrooms High-implementing teachers, regardless of whether they had a low- or highly engaged classroom, held beliefs that SEL was necessary to establish classroom climate for the normative academic and social development of students; whereas low-implementing teachers expressed a deficit-minded attitudes towards need for SEL initiatives. However, when typologies were collapsed by <b>engagement</b> <b>status</b> (observed highly engaged classroom vs. observed low-engaged classrooms), integrating SEL practices was more salient to teachers with highly engaged classrooms. Additionally, teachers with highly engaged classrooms demonstrated via interviews and observations that relationship building and proactive classroom management were priorities and professional strengths. The key emergent theme among teachers with highly engaged classrooms (regardless of implementation status) was classroom control. Low-implementing teachers with highly engaged classrooms demonstrated more authoritarianism during interviews and classroom observations, whereas high-implementing teachers with highly engaged classrooms were more constructivist in classroom structure, management, and philosophy. Student surveys (N= 325; 50 % Free/reduced priced lunch; identifying as 30 % white, 30 % African American, 17 % Latino, 11 % Asian, 9 % “Other”) substantiated certain qualitative thematic findings: students reported feeling more supported and socially efficacious with high-implementing teachers.

Three types of diversity were considered: ethnic diversity existing at the school level, relational diversity at the peer network level, and motivational diversity at the group level. Ethnic diversity was observed in the student body as well as among school teachers and staff. Relational diversity was measured by z-scores resulting from binomial tests reflecting how closely two pair of individuals were connected in the peer network. Finally, motivational diversity was measured as the dispersion (SD) around peer group mean engagement levels, thereby reflecting the diversity of engagement within each peer group. The results indicated that adolescents in this ethnically diverse middle school were overall highly engaged; their engagement patterns were comparable to previous findings from homogeneous samples consisting largely of European American adolescents. Also consistent with prior findings, the mean engagement levels of students 2 ̆ 7 peer group members were {{a significant predictor of}} changes in adolescents 2 ̆ 7 own engagement, which suggests peer influence on adolescents 2 ̆ 7 classroom engagement. Although previous literature suggests that individuals in diverse settings tend to be less well connected to one another, the adolescents in this ethnically diverse school were well connected with their peers. Unexpectedly, almost all students 2 ̆ 7 peer groups were ethnically diverse.

Functional <b>status,</b> <b>engagement</b> in care, and psychosocial well-being were measured by the Health Status Outcome Dimensions(HSOD) instrument. The HSOD is the foundation for developing a computer-based infrastructure for the analysis of health related outcomes. The consecutive, convenience sample of 308 subjects was drawn from five acute clinical populations: pulmonary; cerebrovascular, cardiac; gastrointestinal; and infection. Logistic and multiple regression analyses were used to test the relationships between control (patient and setting) variables, health status, and the dependent variables of type of problem identified, number of problems identified, and the time required to implement interventions ordered for the patient. In seven of ten models, control variables of facility, age, and/or severity of illness contributed to a model at p <. 01. In six of ten models, at least one health status measure significantly explained variation beyond the control variables, at p <. 01. Study results support using data gathered during the course of care, to evaluate the process of that care. Further work is needed to understand the effects of setting and provider variables on the use of health status data in care planning. Computer-based outcomes infrastructures are essential to support the collection and analysis of health status over time...|$|R
40|$|Irigaray&# 039;s {{critique}} of the phallocentric subject&# 039;s implicit dependence on the maternal-feminine "outside" is compelling. Her postulation of nonhierarchical sexual difference gives the relational world of woman specificity and Irigaray brings the subject&# 039;s worldview to earth as merely {{the relation of the}} male human to the world. But the focus of her transvaluation remains largely anthropocentric; and she maintains too many aspects of the privilege of the subject&# 039;s sovereignty as proper to male subjectivity. I suggest that, we need to extend Irigaray and to think sexual difference beyond the human. Drawing from Elizabeth Grosz, Gilles Deleuze, Henri Bergson and Jakob Von Uexküll, I argue that we need to think life beyond the constitution of the organism as the continuous enmeshment of different milieus. Sexual difference is a force of differentiation that articulates relationships between organisms and organs as crucial aspects of many milieus that make up the Earth. Along with the sexually differentiated aspects of milieus, there are rhythms of difference constitutive of milieus that are not sexed. The first section of the essay describes Irigaray&# 039;s conceptualization of sexual difference between humans. Then I turn to her <b>engagement</b> with the <b>status</b> of nonhuman animals in "Animal Compassion. " I suggest her approach in this essay is too anthropocentric and move to a discussion of Uexküll&# 039;s thinking on milieus as a way to extend the concepts of difference and sexual difference into posthuman contexts. The essay concludes by reading Irigaray&# 039;s concept of difference with Deleuze and Bergson...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between optimism, appraisal of injuries, coping processes, {{engagement with the}} rehabilitation program, and injury rehabilitation adherence, in injured athletes has not been extensively examined. These factors have been examined extensively individually {{and some of the}} factors have been extensively investigated together, but these factors have not been examined in detail as a complete process (Albinson & Petrie, 2003; Chang, 2002; Gustafsson & Skoog, 2012; Walker, Thatcher, & Lavallee, 2007) A group of 23 injured athletes participated in this research. Data collection was undertaken across a period of 8 weeks, with questionnaires being administered online through links sent out via email. The questionnaires were examining demographics, optimism, cognitive appraisal, coping, rehabilitation adherence, and rehabilitation engagement. The optimism, cognitive appraisal, and coping questionnaires were completed prior to or as soon as possible after the athletes first treatment session. The rehabilitation adherence and rehabilitation engagement questionnaires were completed {{at the end of each}} week for a period of eight weeks after the initial questionnaires were completed. Psychometric evaluations found an acceptable level of internal consistency for the measures. Correlation analysis found relationships between rehabilitation adherence and rehabilitation <b>engagement.</b> The initial <b>status</b> and rate of change for rehabilitation adherence and engagement were examined. Suggesting that; injured athletes that are high in rehabilitation adherence at the beginning of their rehabilitation treatment become less adherent at a slower rate than injured athletes who are initially low in adherence, athletes who are initially high in rehabilitation engagement become less engaged at a slower rate than injured athletes who initially are low in rehabilitation engagement, and that injured athletes who are becoming less adherent will become less engaged at a faster rate as time passes from when the injured athlete suffered their injury.

40|$|Svjesne da se više ne potvrđuju samo senzibilnošću, već i fizičkim i radnim sposobnostima, ne ostavljajući da se ovladava njihovim djelovanjem i njihovom sviješću, žene su dolazile u sukob sa starom ideologijom o odvojenim sferama, izazivajući povremene mizoginske provale, koje su se na osobit način očitovale u društvenom i kulturnom životu Dubrovnika krajem 17. i tijekom 18. stoljeća. The {{eighteenth century}} saw the {{affirmation}} of gender equality as a distinctive {{value of the}} civilized society of Europe. Education {{was no longer a}} privilege of the nobility, and young, accomplished ladies from the well-todo commoner families of Dubrovnik were not an exception. An active process of change could also be anticipated in the day-to-day lives of common working women, who contributed in their own way to the establishment of a new middle class. By doing so, they audaciously challenged the antiquated yet dominant ideology of gender difference, based on the centuries-long notion of «separate spheres,» according to which the role and nature of women were determined by the limits of their households. Literary men, preachers, and others in support of conservative views raised their voice against manifestations of women’s consciousness, their accusations often being imbued with bitter misogyny. Women and their emergence into the public scene were held to be the cause of all the adversities that befell the city of Dubrovnik- the loss of freedom, economic stagnation, pestilence, etc. In the mid-eighteenth century and particularly {{at the turn of the}} ninetheenth century, Dubrovnik witnessed two antithetical views relating to the issue of women’s position in society: one view saw a woman as a rational individual, creating her own secular attitude towards life, while the other, more traditional view envisaged a woman in the role of an obedient, compliant daughter and wife, an unpredictable creature that could easily be seduced and led astray. Although women’s legal and family <b>status,</b> <b>engagement</b> in public life, and education were deeply marked by traditional and institutional male domination, in these protests we feel the first expressions of the successive and mature emancipation of women...|$|R
40|$|HIV is a {{potentially}} fatal and highly stigmatized disease such that diagnosis {{with the disease}} is often met with high anxiety. Many people who test positive for HIV may not receive sufficient linkage to HIV care or do not remain engaged in continuous HIV medical care once they have entered care. While {{a considerable amount of}} research exists on referral, access, personal characteristics, and mental illness barriers associated with engagement in HIV medical care, far less attention has been given to psychosocial factors, specifically denial and perceived HIV stigma as important barriers to engaging in HIV medical care. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether denial and/or perceived HIV stigma are associated with engagement in HIV medical care for African-American people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Data were collected as part of a peer-based community health worker program (CHW), based in Washington DC, designed to link PLWHA to HIV medical care and services. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine whether the psychosocial variables were predictors of engagement in HIV medical care. Results indicated that disclosure is a major issue for this population, as 46 % of the participants had not disclosed their HIV status to others. Separate analyses were conducted for the total sample (n= 262) and with the disclosed sample (n= 120). Results in the total sample revealed that disclosure of HIV status was associated with <b>engagement</b> in HIV <b>status.</b> PLWHA who disclosed HIV status to others were 2. 2 times more likely to engage in HIV medical care than persons who had not disclosed HIV status. In the disclosed sample, gender, educational level and employment status were also associated with engagement in HIV medical care. Women and persons with low educational level and unemployed were less likely to engage in HIV medical care. Denial and perceived HIV stigma were not found to be independent predictors of engagement in HIV medical care when other covariates were included in the model. Disclosure of HIV status, gender and educational level were predictors of engagement in HIV medical care for this population. These obstacles to care may be amenable to disclosure and gender-specific interventions; and, therefore, warrant better understanding to improve outreach interventions to PLWHA who are not engaged in HIV medical care...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to examine how {{specialisation}} in diagnostic radiography has occurred. In particular, this research aims to examine the contemporary ethos of specialism in diagnostic radiography; how the higher status of technology has developed over patient-centredness; {{the impact of the}} working relationship between radiology and diagnostic radiography on this development; the relationship between gender and the nature of occupation in the development of diagnostic radiography. Qualitative data was collected using 31 semi-structured interviews that took the form of oral histories where possible. The time-span covered is 1932 - 2001. Findings show that a paradigm shift is required. Defining specialism and expert practice is difficult, as both are negotiated constructs that tend to have local meaning. Not all specialisms in diagnostic radiography increase professional autonomy and management has a key role to play in the development of radiography as a profession to enable full <b>engagement</b> with consultant <b>status.</b> To a great extent, diagnostic radiography and its associated specialisms is governed by an emphasis on technology rather than the patient. This emphasis has roots in power difference between radiologists and radiographers and within the hierarchy of radiography. Radiologists have controlled radiographers to provide a service to radiology rather than the patients, and, although this is still evident in some hospitals, it is changing. Task offloading from radiologists to radiographers confuses the notions of specialism and radiography is in danger of seeking professional development through emulating radiology rather than using radiographic caring skills and expanding practice with a humanistic and patient focused emphasis. Radiography emerged as a pioneering, elite profession that could originally be regarded as a specialism of nursing. Technology and medicine gradually reduced radiographic practice to have a technological and quantitative focus. There is now a demand to once again broaden radiographic practice to actively contribute to a patient-centred service in an autonomous, more qualitative and self-directed manner. A collection of oral histories has been a direct result of this research. Specialisms are a broad area of diagnostic radiography and rather than focus on technological areas of practice, a more holistic range of specialisms could be embraced to enable the profession to progress. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether the {{perceived}} quality of the student-teacher relationship in second grade predicted reading comprehension gains over the course of one year in a model that included variables known to effect reading comprehension: quality of classroom instruction, social economic <b>status,</b> <b>engagement,</b> and peer relatedness. Reading comprehension gains for 255 second grade students in a high socio-economic school district were obtained in a pre-post fashion from school records over a single academic year. Teachers' rated each student in their class on one occasion in terms of the degree of conflict and closeness in the student-teacher relationship, the quality of peer relatedness, and classroom engagement. The CLASS (Pianta, Paro, & Hamre, 2008), an observation system, was employed to measure several important classroom variables including emotional support, classroom organization, and instructional support, yielding a teacher competence score. Because the 255 students were nested within seven different elementary schools with 14 different teachers, a hierarchical linear model (HLM) was used with classroom engagement as a mediating variable. There were an insufficient number of teachers and elementary schools to use HLM so an alternative model that estimated the overall relationships among the variables and corrected the significance tests for the nesting of the students within classrooms, and the nesting of the classrooms (teachers) within schools was employed. The hypothesized model fit the data well (÷ 2 = 9. 17, (4), p <. 06, RMSEA =. 07, CFI =. 98). Significant direct paths were found for student-teacher closeness, peer relatedness, and fall reading scores on classroom engagement. Significant indirect paths were found from student-teacher closeness, peer relatedness, and fall reading scores to reading comprehension gains via classroom engagement. Finally, classroom engagement had a positive direct effect on reading comprehension. Teacher competence and conflict in student-teacher relations were unrelated to reading comprehension gains. Study findings have implications for future educational focus such as improving classroom engagement, fostering close student-teacher-relationships, enhancing peer relatedness, and training teachers. Future research should be conducted with larger and more diverse samples, and examine the student's perception of the student-teacher relationship...|$|R
