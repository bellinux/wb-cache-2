25|$|In the 1998–99 season Carlisle found {{themselves}} in their second successive relegation battle and needing to gain three points from {{the final game of}} the season at home to Plymouth Argyle. At 90 minutes the crowd at Scarborough (Carlisle's relegation rival) were already celebrating before the fourth official stated four minutes of extra time would be played at Brunton Park. In the last kick of the game goalkeeper Jimmy Glass, who had signed in an emergency loan deal from Swindon Town after the transfer deadline, scored from a corner kick which <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> in a last gasp effort to win the match.|$|E
500|$|The 1890 Australian team touring England was {{relatively}} inexperienced. [...] The team missed the all-round ability of George Giffen who {{had refused to}} tour, thinking it unlikely the tour would be a sporting or financial success. [...] The Australians won 13matches on tour, losing16 and drawing9. [...] Trott scored 1,211first-class runs (at 20.87 average) with a highest score of 186 against Cambridge University Past and Present, and captured 20wickets. [...] Disappointed by Trott's performances, Wisden felt that he [...] "...barely maintained the reputation he had so honestly gained during the tour of 1888 ... it cannot be said that <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> expectations".|$|E
500|$|In 1987, he {{was chosen}} to captain the England B team in a match against the full {{national}} team of Malta, but {{it was to be}} his only appearance in an England shirt, and he has subsequently been described {{as one of the best}} defenders of his era never to be selected for the full England team. Bruce later stated, [...] "I bumped into former England manager Bobby Robson in Benfica (sic). <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> me and said 'I should have capped you'. It was nice to hear but it still didn't get me one .... I'll always be a little disappointed I didn't get one." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 29, 1918, it was {{reported}} that Earl Randall, of Dundee, Oregon, a crewman on Dora, had been lost overboard during his course of duty and drowned. [...] The incident occurred on the Coquille River near Riverton while the vessel was steaming towards Coquille. [...] Randall was last seen walking through the engine room. [...] The next thing that was noticed was his cries for help as <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the surface of the river from underwater. [...] The vessel was reversed and a life ring was thrown, but it was too late. [...] Randall's body was recovered two hours later.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the very}} evening that Cromwell's raid ended, the leading troops of Goring's command {{destroyed}} part of Cromwell's own regiment near Faringdon. On 3 May Rupert and Maurice appeared {{with a force}} of all arms at Burford. Yet the [...] "Committee of Both Kingdoms", though aware on 29 May of Goring's move, only made up its mind to stop Fairfax on the 3rd, and did not send off orders till the 5th. These orders were {{to the effect that}} a detachment was to be sent to the relief of Taunton, and that the main army was to return. Fairfax gladly obeyed, even though a siege of Oxford, and not the enemy's field army, was the objective assigned him. But long before <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Thames valley, the situation was again changed.|$|E
2500|$|Klebold {{walked down}} the steps toward the cafeteria. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Kirklin, who was already wounded and lying on the ground, weakly calling for help. Klebold said, [...] "Sure. I'll help you," [...] then shot Kirklin in the face, {{critically}} wounding him. Daniel Rohrbough and Sean Graves had descended the staircase when Klebold and Harris' attention was diverted by the students on the grass; Graves—paralyzed beneath the waist—had crawled into {{the doorway of the}} cafeteria's west entrance and collapsed. Klebold shot Rohrbough, who was already fatally wounded by the shots previously fired by Harris, at close range through the upper left chest and then stepped over the injured Sean Graves to enter the cafeteria. Officials speculated that Klebold went to the cafeteria to check on the propane bombs. Harris shot down the steps at several students sitting near the cafeteria's entrance, severely wounding and partially paralyzing 17-year-old Anne-Marie Hochhalter as she tried to flee. Klebold came out of the cafeteria and went back up the stairs to join Harris.|$|E

2500|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home to play the Reds, dropping the opener 6-4 when Dee Gordon committed a costly error {{in the seventh inning}} with the game tied, leading to four runs scoring. The Dodgers wasted a fine start by Kershaw on June 15 as the Scott Elbert allowed a go-ahead eighth-inning single to Joey Votto and the Reds won 3-2. Scott Rolen got three hits and drove in three runs as the Reds finished off their sweep of the Dodgers 7-2. The slumping Dodgers were subsequently handled by Houston starter Brett Myers, who retired 17 consecutive batters at one point and made only 98 pitches in a 7-3 Astros win. The Dodgers home losing streak hit five when they were shut out by the Astros 7-0 on June 18. The game was doubly frustrating because starting catcher Rod Barajas suffered an ankle strain in the second inning and joined the multitude of Dodgers already on the disabled list. Manager Don Mattingly said after the game, [...] "We're frustrated, that's for sure, but you know what? We don't have time to be frustrated... This {{is not the time to}} feel sorry for ourselves." [...] The Dodgers avoided being swept by the last place Astros with a 1-0 victory on June 19, that ended the five-game losing streak. A solo homer by Dioner Navarro in the bottom of the 8th inning was all the Dodgers offense could muster, but it was enough as Hiroki Kuroda and two relievers pitched a shutout. In the next game, Clayton Kershaw was dominant, striking out 11 in a two-hit shutout of the Detroit Tigers. He also hit a two-run eighth-inning single to extended the Dodgers lead in the 4-0 win. Chad Billingsley's turn was next and he also pitched effectively, allowing just one run in 5 1/3 innings as the Dodgers won their third straight, 6-1, over the Tigers. Matt Kemp reached base all five times <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> bat in the series finale, with three hits (including a triple) and two walks but the Dodgers were done in by four home runs hit by the Tigers off of Ted Lilly in the 7-5 loss. The Los Angeles Angels came to town next for the next installment of the Freeway Series. In the opener, the Angels won a sloppy game with baserunning and fielding errors 8-3. [...] "I don't like the way it's going, thats for sure." [...] Manager Don Mattingly said after the Dodgers lost 6-1 in game 2. The Dodgers bounced back to take the series finale 3-2. Clayton Kershaw struck out eleven in the game and pitched his second straight complete game, the first Dodger to do so in 11 years. Tony Gwynn, Jr.'s RBI single in the bottom of the ninth won it for the Dodgers.|$|E
