5|$|Noé's dream {{project for}} many years, the {{production}} {{was made possible}} after the commercial success of his previous feature film, Irréversible (2002). Enter the Void was primarily financed by Wild Bunch, while Fidélité Films led the actual production. With a mix of professionals and newcomers, the film makes heavy use of imagery inspired by experimental cinema and psychedelic drug experiences. Principal photography took place on location <b>in</b> <b>Tokyo,</b> <b>and</b> involved many complicated crane shots. Co-producers included the visual effects studio BUF Compagnie, which also provided the computer-generated imagery. The film's soundtrack is a collage of electronic pop and experimental music.|$|E

He never did see the ambassador's daughter. Back at home, the Indians gave him his unconditional release. Berg continued on to the Philippines, Korea and Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Spider-Man 3 premiered on April 16, 2007 <b>in</b> <b>Tokyo,</b> <b>and</b> was {{released}} in the United States in both conventional and IMAX theaters on May 4, 2007.

However, it received mixed reviews; while the effects and action scenes were praised, aspects of the plot (such as Harry's butler knowing how his father really died and not telling him), {{and the use of}} three villains (especially the treatment of Venom) were criticized. A fourth film, titled Spider-Man 4, was set to be released on May 6, 2011, but was canceled in favor of the 2012 reboot The Amazing Spider-Man.|$|E

5|$|When he was five, Kanae and {{his mother}} joined Ichirō <b>in</b> <b>Tokyo</b> <b>and</b> settled in a {{tenement}} house in the San'ya area. His mother did sewing work to help support the family, and with her sister Tama provided maid service to the Mori household, and thus Kanae often met his younger cousin, Kaita Murayama, who, like Kanae, {{was to make a}} career in art. The painter Harada Naojirō, whom Ōgai had befriended when the two were studying in Germany, asked Kanae's mother, whom he had seen at the Mori household, to model for the painting Kannon Bodhisattva Riding the Dragon of 1890. Such occurrences may have contributed to attracting Kanae to art.|$|E
5|$|Arnold was {{disappointed}} with what XXIBomber Command had achieved, and wanted the Command {{to produce results}} quickly. In addition, Hansell's preference for precision bombing {{was no longer in}} accordance with the views of the Twentieth Air Force headquarters, which wanted a greater emphasis on area attacks. In late December 1944 Arnold decided to relieve Hansell of his command. Seeing LeMay's success in improving XXBomber Command's performance, Arnold thought LeMay could solve the problems at XXIBomber Command, and replaced Hansell with him. Hansell was informed of Arnold's decision on 6January, but remained in his position until mid-January. During this period, XXIBomber Command conducted unsuccessful precision bombing attacks on the Musashino aircraft plant <b>in</b> <b>Tokyo</b> <b>and</b> a Mitsubishi Aircraft Works factory in Nagoya on 9 and 14January respectively. The last attack planned by Hansell was more successful, however: a force of 77 B-29s crippled a Kawasaki Aircraft Industries factory near Akashi on 19January. During XXIBomber Command's first three months of operations, it lost an average of 4.1% of aircraft dispatched in each raid.|$|E

5|$|Japanese {{cities were}} highly {{vulnerable}} to damage from firebombing {{due to their}} design and the weak state of the country's civil defense organization. Urban areas were typically congested, and most buildings were constructed from highly flammable materials such as paper and wood. In addition, industrial and military facilities in urban areas were normally surrounded by densely populated residential buildings. Despite this vulnerability, few cities had full-time professional firefighters and most relied on volunteers. Such firefighting forces that did exist lacked modern equipment and used outdated tactics. Air raid drills had been held <b>in</b> <b>Tokyo</b> <b>and</b> Osaka since 1928, however, and from 1937 local governments were required to provide civilians with manuals that explained {{how to respond to}} air attacks. Few air-raid shelters and other air defense facilities for civilians and industry were constructed prior to the Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|Sony Pictures Entertainment built {{a promotional}} website, {{releasing}} many previews {{and launched a}} viral marketing campaign, among other moves. Tie-ins included a video game by Beenox. The film premiered on June 30 <b>in</b> <b>Tokyo,</b> <b>and</b> was released in the United States on July 3, ten years after release of Spider-Man (2002), in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D and released in home media in November 2012. The reboot received generally favorable reviews, with critics praising mostly Andrew Garfield's performance, the visual style, James Horner's musical score, and the realistic portrayal of the title character, but {{the introduction of the}} character, the Lizard, was criticized for being too surreal for the film. The film was a box office success, grossing over $757 million worldwide, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2012. The film's sequel, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, was released on May 2, 2014.|$|E
