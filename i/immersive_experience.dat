5|$|In April 2015, Activision {{announced}} a new entry in the series, titled Guitar Hero Live. The title was developed by Activision's internal studio FreeStyleGames, who previously had worked on the DJ Hero spinoff titles. FreeStyleGames were given free rein to reboot the Guitar Hero series for next-generation consoles. One of their first innovations was to drop the standard five-button guitar controller, ultimately designing a six-button guitar controller, with two rows of three buttons each, allowing them to mimic actual guitar fingering. Guitar Hero Live was released with both a career and an online mode. The career mode used full-motion video taken {{from the perspective of}} a lead guitarist underneath the note highway, to create an <b>immersive</b> <b>experience</b> to the player. The online mode, called GHTV, discarded the previous downloadable content approach and used a music video channel approach to stream playable songs to players, adding new songs to the catalog on a weekly basis. The game was released in October 2015.|$|E

5|$|The {{title is}} {{considered}} a reboot of the series; instead of using a five-button guitar-shaped game controller, the game shipped with a six-button controller, arranged in two rows of three aimed to provide more realistic fingering positions than the five-button controller. The game includes 42 songs on the game's disc, presented in sets using full motion video taken from the first-person perspective of the lead guitarist as the background visuals to create an <b>immersive</b> <b>experience.</b> Guitar Hero Live does not use traditional downloadable content to expand the game and is not backward compatible with previous songs from Guitar Hero games. Instead, the game includes the online Guitar Hero TV (GHTV) mode modeled after music video channels that players can jump {{in or out of}} at any time, playing through ongoing songs in a curated fashion. GHTV, through in-game rewards and microtransactions, supports the ability to play any song in the library, perform Premium shows where the newest tracks to GHTV will be found, or even unlock all features for a 24-hour period as part of a Party Pass. Two hundred songs were available at the release of the game, with more added over time, averaging about six new songs each week.|$|E

25|$|As {{technology}} {{continues to}} advance, {{more can be}} added onto the controller to give the player a more <b>immersive</b> <b>experience</b> when playing different games. There are some controllers that have presets so that the buttons are mapped a certain way to make playing certain games easier. Along with the presets, a player can sometimes custom map the buttons to better accommodate their play style. On keyboard and mouse, different actions in the game are already preset to keys on the keyboard. Most games allow the player to change that so that the actions are mapped to different keys that are more to their liking.

500|$|Following {{a five-year}} hiatus, as {{described}} below, Activision announced Guitar Hero Live for release in late 2015 on most seventh-generation and eighth-generation consoles.

The best-selling game of 1997, Riven sold 1.5million copies in one year. After the game's release, Robyn Miller left Cyan to form his own development studio, ending the professional partnership of the two brothers.

40|$|This {{evaluation}} of Immersive Learning at Ball State University was twofold: to examine both {{the profile of}} immersive learning students and to explore the relations between <b>immersive</b> learning <b>experiences</b> and self-determination factors {{during the course of}} a semester. These selfdetermination factors included autonomy, competence, and relatedness. A comprehensive profile of both demographic and academic characteristics of the immersive learning student was defined through this study. The relations between self-determination factors and level of immersion were investigated. No statistically significant differences in perceived levels of autonomy or competence were noted throughout the semester between the three groups (full immersion experiences, partial immersion experiences, and no immersion experiences). However, perceptions of relatedness differed between students who engaged in fully immersive learning opportunities and those who participated in partially <b>immersive</b> <b>experiences</b> and courses without immersion; fully <b>immersive</b> <b>experiences</b> reported lower perceptions of relatedness.

500|$|Roguelikes {{traditionally}} implement permadeath. Once {{a character}} dies, the player must {{begin a new}} game, which will regenerate the game's levels anew due to procedural generation. A [...] "save game" [...] feature will only provide suspension of gameplay and not a limitlessly recoverable state; the stored session is deleted upon resumption or character death. Players can circumvent this by backing up stored game data ("save scumming"), an act that is usually considered cheating; the developers of Rogue introduced the permadeath feature after introducing a save function, finding that players were repeatedly loading saved games to achieve the best results. According to Rogues Michael Toy, they saw their approach to permadeath not {{as a means to}} make the game painful or difficult but to put weight on every decision the player made as to create a more <b>immersive</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E
500|$|According to Martin, {{the fantasy}} genre rarely focuses on sex and sexuality, instead often {{treating}} sexuality in a juvenile way or neglecting it completely. Martin, however, considers sexuality an important {{driving force in}} human life {{that should not be}} excluded from the narrative. Providing sensory detail for an <b>immersive</b> <b>experience</b> is more important than plot advancement for Martin, who aims to let the readers experience the novels' sex scenes, [...] "whether it's a great transcendent, exciting, mind blowing sex, or whether it's disturbing, twisted, dark sex, or disappointing perfunctory sex." [...] Martin was fascinated by medieval contrasts where knights venerated their ladies with poems and wore their favors in tournaments while their armies mindlessly raped women in wartime. The non-existent concept of adolescence in the Middle Ages served as a model for Daenerys' sexual activity at the age of 13 in the books. The novels also allude to the incestuous practices in the Ptolemaic dynasty of Ancient Egypt to keep their bloodlines pure.|$|E
