50|$|After Professor Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology has {{introduced}} a basic configuration of VING in 2006 where he used a tip of atomic force microscope (AFM) to induce the deformation of a single vertical ZnO nanowire, the first development of VING is followed in 2007. The first VING utilizes the counter electrode with the periodic surface grating resembling the arrays of AFM tip as a moving electrode. Since the counter electrode is not in full contact with {{the tips of the}} piezoelectric nanowire, its motion in-plane or out-of-plane occurred by the external vibration induces the deformation of the piezoelectric nanostructure, leading to the generation of the electrical potential distribution inside each individual nanowire.

40|$|We discuss {{an effect}} of dc current and dc voltage (stopping bias) {{generation}} in a semiconductor superlattice subjected by an ac electric field and its phase-shifted n-th harmonic. In the low field limit, we find a simple dependence of dc voltage on a strength, frequency, and relative phase of mixing harmonics for an arbitrary even value of n. We show that the generated dc voltage has a maximum when a frequency of ac field is {{of the order of}} a scattering constant of electrons in a superlattice. This means that for typical semiconductor superlattices at room temperature operating in the THz frequency domain the effect is really observable. We also made a comparison of a recent paper describing {{an effect of}} a <b>directed</b> <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> in a semiconductor superlattice subjected by ac field and its second harmonic (n= 2) [K. Seeger, Appl. Phys. Lett. 76 (2000) 82] with our earlier findings describing the same effect [K. Alekseev et al., Europhys. Lett. 47 (1999) 595; cond-mat/ 9903092]. For the mixing of an ac field and its n-th harmonic with n>= 4, we found that additionally to the phase-shift controlling of the dc current, there is a frequency control. This frequency controlling of the dc current direction is absent in the case of n= 2. The found effect is that, both the dc current suppression and the dc current reversals exist for some particular values of ac field frequency. For typical semiconductor superlattices such an interesting behavior of the dc current should be observable also in the THz domain. Finally, we briefly review the history of the problem of the dc <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> at mixing of harmonics in semiconductors and semiconductor microstructures.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{characterization}} of Geoalkalibacter subterraneus is presented, which is a novel halophilic anode respiring bacterium (ARB) previously selected and identified in a potentiostatically controlled bioelectrochemical system (BES) inoculated with sediments from a salt plant. Pure culture electroactive biofilms of Glk. subterraneus were grown during chronoamperometric batch experiments at a graphite electrode poised at + 200 mV (vs. SCE) with 10 mM acetate as the electron donor. These biofilms exhibited the highest current density (4. 68 +/- 0. 54 A m(- 2)) reported on a planar material with a pure culture under saline conditions (3. 5 % NaCl). To investigate possible anodic electron transfer (ET) mechanisms, cyclic voltammetry (CV) of mature visible apparent reddish biofilms was performed under bioelectrocatalytic substrate consumption (turnover) {{and in the absence}} of the substrate (non-turnover). CV evidenced a well defined typical sigmoidal shape and a pair of clear redox couples under turnover and non-turnover conditions, respectively. Moreover, the calculation of their formal potentials indicated the presence of a common ET mechanism present in both CV conditions between - 427. 6 +/- 0. 5 (E-f,E- 2) and - 364. 8 +/- 4. 5 mV (E-f,E- 3). Confocal laser scanning microscopy inspection showed a biofilm structure composed of several layers of metabolically active bacteria that spread all over the electrode material within a biofilm up to 76 +/- 7 mu m thick. Such high value compared to the thickness values normally reported in the literature for pure culture electroactive bacteria justifies further investigations. Taken together, these results suggest that Glk. subterraneus performs a direct ET mechanism in contact with the electrode material.

This code, called RRTMGP, will be a completely restructured and modern version of the accurate RRTMG radiation code (Mlawer et al., 1997; Iacono et al., 2008) that has been implemented in many General Circulation Models (GCMs) including the Navy Global Environmental Model (NAVGEM), the NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM), and NOAA’s Global Forecast System (GFS).

40|$|Rotating {{biological}} contactors (RBCs) for {{wastewater treatment}} {{began in the}} 1970 s. Removal of organic matter has been targeted within organic loading rates of up to 120 g m− 2 d− 1 with an optimum at around 15 g m− 2 d− 1 for combined BOD and ammonia removal. Full nitrification is achievable under appropriate process conditions with oxidation rates of up to 6 g m− 2 d− 1 reported for municipal wastewater. The RBC process has been adapted for denitrification with reported removal rates of up to 14 g m− 2 d− 1 with nitrogen rich wastewaters. Different media types {{can be used to}} improve organic/nitrogen loading rates through selecting for different bacterial groups. The RBC has been applied with only limited success for enhanced biological phosphorus removal and attained up to 70 % total phosphorus removal. Compared to other biofilm processes, RBCs had 35 % lower energy costs than trickling filters but higher demand than wetland systems. However, the land footprint for the same treatment is lower than these alternatives. The RBC process has been used for removal of priority pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products. The RBC system has been shown to eliminate 99 % of faecal coliforms and the majority of other wastewater pathogens. Novel RBC reactors include systems for energy generation such as algae, methane production and microbial fuel cells for <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> <b>generation.</b> Issues such as scale up remain challenging for the future application of RBC technology and topics such as phosphorus removal and denitrification still require further research. High volumetric removal rate, solids retention, low footprint, hydraulic residence times are characteristics of RBCs.

We compared {{the results of the}} armchair with that of the zigzag carbon nanotubes for the same conditions (i. e. when the normalized current is plotted against the amplitude). Quantitatively they agree with each other except that the absolute value of the peaks of the current for zigzag is about 1. 1 times that of the armchair. We noticed that the current is negative similar to that observed in zigzag CNs describing the same effect. However {{it is interesting to note}} that graph of normalized current against omega tau showed that the armchair is greater than that of the zigzag for about 1. 1 times which is opposite. We also observed that when the phase shift theta lies between pi divided by 2 and 3 pi divided by 2 there is an inversion and the current becomes positive.

40|$|Electrical power {{generation}} from a moderate temperature thermal source {{by means of}} direct conversion of infrared radiation is important and highly desirable for energy harvesting from waste heat and micropower applications. Here, we demonstrate direct rectified {{power generation}} from an unbiased large-area nanoantenna-coupled tunnel diode rectifier, called a rectenna. Using a vacuum radiometric measurement technique with irradiation from a temperature-stabilized thermal source, a generated power density of 8 nW/cm$^ 2 $ is observed at a source temperature of 450 C for the unbiased rectenna across an optimized load resistance. The optimized load resistance for the peak power generation for each temperature coincides with the tunnel diode resistance at zero bias and corresponds to the impedance matching condition for a rectifying antenna. Current voltage measurements of a thermally illuminated large-area rectenna show current zero crossing shifts into the second quadrant indicating rectification. Photon-assisted tunneling in the unbiased rectenna is modeled as the mechanism for the large short-circuit photocurrents observed where the photon energy serves as an effective bias across the tunnel junction.
