5|$|With a {{molecular}} formula of C3H4Cl2F2O and a condensed structural formula of CHCl2CF2OCH3, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for methoxyflurane is 2,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoro-1-methoxyethane. It is a <b>halogenated</b> <b>ether</b> {{in form of}} a clear, colorless liquid, and its vapor has a strong fruity aroma. It is miscible with ethanol, acetone, chloroform, diethyl ether, and fixed oils. It is soluble in rubber.|$|E
50|$|Several {{compounds}} {{related to}} the <b>halogenated</b> <b>ether</b> anesthetics have similar convulsant effects rather than producing sedation, {{and this has been}} helpful in studying the mechanism of action of these drugs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Halogenated</b> <b>ethers</b> {{have the}} {{advantages}} of being non-flammable as well as less toxic than earlier general anesthetics. <b>Halogenated</b> <b>ethers</b> differ from other ethers because they contain at least one halogen atom in each molecule. Examples of <b>halogenated</b> <b>ethers</b> include the general anesthetics isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane. However, not all <b>halogenated</b> <b>ethers</b> have anesthetic effects, and some compounds such as flurothyl do the opposite and have stimulant and convulsant effects.|$|R
50|$|Newer {{intravenous}} anesthetics (such as propofol) {{have increased}} the options of anesthesiologists, but <b>halogenated</b> <b>ethers</b> remain a mainstay of general anesthesia.|$|R
50|$|All {{inhalation}} anesthetics {{in current}} clinical use are <b>halogenated</b> <b>ethers,</b> except for halothane (which is a halogenated hydrocarbon or haloalkane), nitrous oxide, and xenon.|$|R

50|$|What differentiates a <b>halogenated</b> <b>ether</b> {{from other}} types of ethers is the {{substitution}} (halogenation) {{of one or more}} hydrogen atoms with a halogen atom. Halogen atoms include fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.|$|E
50|$|Enflurane (2-chloro-1,1,2,-trifluoroethyl-difluoromethyl ether) is a <b>halogenated</b> <b>ether.</b> Developed by Ross Terrell in 1963, it {{was first}} used {{clinically}} in 1966.

50|$|Marketed {{under the}} trade names Metopryl and Neothyl, methoxypropane {{was used as}} an {{alternative}} to diethyl ether because of its greater potency. Its use as an anaesthetic has since been supplanted by modern <b>halogenated</b> <b>ethers</b> which are much less flammable.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common use of <b>halogenated</b> <b>ethers</b> has been in anesthesiology. The first widely used {{inhalation}} anesthetic was diethyl ether, which is a non-substituted (non-halogenated) ether.

50|$|As another example, in {{anesthesia}} (particularly IV anesthesia {{and general}} anesthesia) multiple agents {{are almost always}} required - including hypnotics or analgesic inducing/maintenance agents such as Versed or Diprivan, usually an opioid analgesic such as morphine or Demerol, a paralytic such as vecuronium, and in inhaled general anesthesia generally a <b>halogenated</b> <b>ether</b> anesthetic such as sevoflurane or desflurane.|$|E

Small amounts of trifluoroacetic acid can be formed from both halothane and isoflurane metabolism and possibly accounts for cross sensitization of patients between these agents.|$|R

5000|$|The {{possibility}} of anaesthesia by the inert gas argon in particular (even at 10 to 15 bar) {{suggests that the}} mechanism of action of volatile anaesthetics is an effect best described by physical chemistry, and not a chemical bonding action. However, the agent may bind to a receptor with a weak interaction [...] A physical interaction such as swelling of nerve cell membranes from gas solution in the lipid bilayer may be operative. Notably, the gases hydrogen, helium, and neon have not {{been found to have}} anaesthetic properties at any pressure. Helium at high pressures produces nervous irritation ("anti-anaesthesia"), suggesting that the anaesthetic mechanism(s) may be operated in reverse by this gas (i.e., nerve membrane compression). Also, some <b>halogenated</b> <b>ethers</b> (such as flurothyl) also possess this [...] "anti-anaesthetic" [...] effect, providing further evidence for this theory.|$|R

40|$|A {{molecular}} understanding of volatile anesthetic mechanisms of action will require structural descriptions of anesthetic-protein complexes. Previous work {{has demonstrated that}} the halogenated alkane volatile anesthetics halothane and chloroform bind to the hydrophobic core of the four-α-helix bundle (Aα 2 -L 38 M) 2 (Johansson et al., 2000, 2003). This study shows that the <b>halogenated</b> <b>ether</b> anesthetics isoflurane, sevoflurane, and enflurane are also bound to the hydrophobic core of the four-α-helix bundle, using isothermal titration calorimetry. Isoflurane and sevoflurane both bound to the four-α-helix bundle with Kd values of 140 ± 10 μM, whereas enflurane bound with a Kd value of 240 ± 10 μM. The ΔH° values associated with isoflurane, sevoflurane, and enflurane binding were – 7. 7 ± 0. 1 kcal/mol, − 8. 2 ± 0. 2 kcal/mol, and – 7. 2 ± 0. 1 kcal/mol, respectively. The ΔS° values accompanying isoflurane, sevoflurane, and enflurane binding were − 8. 5 cal/mol K, − 10. 4 cal/mol K, and − 8. 0 cal/mol K, respectively. The {{results indicate that the}} hydrophobic core of (Aα 2 -L 38 M) 2 is able to accommodate three modern ether anesthetics with Kd values that approximate their clinical EC 50 values. The ΔH° values point to the importance of polar interactions for volatile general anesthetic binding, and suggest that hydrogen bonding to the ether oxygens may be operative...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesSevoflurane is a <b>halogenated</b> {{fluorinated}} <b>ether</b> that undergoes hepatic biotransformation through cytochrome P 4502 E 1. <b>Halogenated</b> <b>ethers</b> undergoing biotransformation by P 4502 E 1 {{can produce}} {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS), weakening the antioxidant defense mechanism. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between the activity of erythrocyte antioxidant enzymes and sevoflurane. MethodsAnimals were divided in four groups: Group 1 – control: 100 % oxygen (1 L. min- 1 for 60 min during five consecutive days); Group 2 – 4. 0 % sevoflurane in 100 % oxygen (1 L. min- 1 for 60 minutes during five consecutive days); Group 3 – isoniazid (i. p.), 50 mg. kg- 1 /day for four consecutive days, followed by 100 % oxygen (1 L. min- 1 for 60 minutes during four consecutive days); Group 4 – intraperitoneal isoniazid, 50 mg. kg- 1 daily for four days, followed by 4. 0 % sevoflurane in 100 % oxygen (1 L. min- 1 for 60 minutes during five days). Twelve hours after the last exposure to sevoflurane, animals were sacrificed and their blood was collected through the portal vein for analysis of antioxidant enzymes. ResultsAn increase in the activity of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and a decrease in the activity of catalase were observed, especially in the group of animals pre-treated with isoniazid.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is the study of the {{treatment}} of flue gas issued from a process of biomass gasification in fluidized bed. The flue gas contains tar which should be selectively removed from the fuel components of interest (e. g. H- 2, CO and light hydrocarbons) to avoid condensation and deposits in internal combustion engine. The chosen flue gas treatment is the gas-liquid absorption using solvents, which present specific physicochemical properties (e. g. solubility, viscosity, volatility and chemical and thermal stability) in order to optimize the unit on energetic, technico-economic and environmental criteria. The rational choice of the proper solvent is essential for solving the tar issue. The preselection of the solvents is made using a Hansen parameter in order to evaluate the tar solubility and the saturation vapour pressure of the solvent is obtained using Antoine law. Among the nine families of screened solvents (alcohols, amines, ketones, <b>halogenates,</b> <b>ethers,</b> esters, hydrocarbons, sulphured and chlorinates), acids methyl esters arise as solvents of interest. Methyl oleate has then been selected and studied furthermore. Experimental liquid-vapour equilibrium data using bubbling point and absorption cell measurements and theoretical results obtained by the UNIFAC-Dortmund model confirm the high potential of this solvent and the good agreement between experimental and theoretical results...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis {{describes}} the efficient synthesis of several hypervalent iodine(III) compounds. Electron-rich diaryliodonium salts have been synthesized in a one-pot procedure, employing mCPBA as the oxidant. Both symmetric and unsymmetric diaryliodonium tosylates can be isolated in high yields. An in situ anion exchange also enables the synthesis of previously unobtainable diaryliodonium triflates. A large-scale protocol for the synthesis of a derivative of Koser’s reagent, that is an isolable intermediate in the diaryliodonium tosylate synthesis, is furthermore described. The large-scale synthesis is performed in neat TFE, which can be recovered and recycled. This is very desirable from an environmental point of view. One of the few described syntheses of enantiopure diaryliodonium salts is discussed. Three different enantiopure diaryliodonium salts bearing electron-rich substituents are synthesized in moderate to high yields. The synthesis of these three salts shows the challenge in the preparation of electron-rich substituted unsymmetric salts. The second part of the thesis describes the application of both symmetric and unsymmetric diaryliodonium salts in organic synthesis. A metal-free efficient and fast method for the synthesis of diaryl ethers from diaryliodonium salts has been developed. The substrate scope is wide as both the phenol and the diaryliodonium salt can be varied. Products such as <b>halogenated</b> <b>ethers,</b> ortho-substituted ethers and bulky ethers, that are difficult to obtain with metal-catalyzed procedures, are readily prepared.

40|$|Sevoflurane and {{isoflurane}} are volatile <b>halogenated</b> <b>ether</b> {{widely used}} in anesthesia. Both have comparable potency and easy titratability but sevoflurane has lower pungency and results in faster patient recovery. Isoflurane, however, is more affordable. The nephrotoxicity of sevoflurane is undisputed but studies on isoflurane nephrotoxicity are lacking. The objective {{of this paper is}} to determine the overall nephrotoxicity profile of sevoflurane and isoflurane in donor nephrectomy patients using the renal function markers - nuclear glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum creatinine, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, proteinuria, and glucosuria. A randomized comparative study of postoperative renal functions in donor nephrectomy patients who had received either low-flow (< 1 L/min) sevoflurane or isoflurane were analyzed. The renal parameters were repeated 72 hours post anesthesia. Forty-seven subjects (46 %) were randomized to receive isoflurane while fifty-five received sevoflurane (54 %). Between the two anesthetic groups, there was no significant difference in terms of serum creatinine, total GFR, or nuclear GFR. There was a statistically higher proportion of patients with urine protein-to-creatinine ratios of 0. 2 and above in the isoflurane group (64 % vs. 38 %), while more patients in the sevoflurane group had ratios above 0. 2 (62 % vs. 36 %, P < 0. 05). The type of anesthetic agent was not an independent predictor of increasing serum creatinine, total GFR and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio and nuclear GFR. In conclusion, the overall nephrotoxicity profile of sevoflurane and isoflurane-treated donor nephrectomy patients is minimal...|$|E

40|$|Barbiturates potentiate GABA actions at the GABA(A) {{receptor}} and act {{as central}} nervous system depressants that can induce effects ranging from sedation to general anesthesia. No structural information has been available about how barbiturates are recognized by their protein targets. For this reason, we tested whether these drugs were able to bind specifically to horse spleen apoferritin, a model protein that has previously been shown to bind many anesthetic agents with affinities that are closely correlated with anesthetic potency. Thiopental, pentobarbital, and phenobarbital were all found to bind to apoferritin with affinities ranging from 10 - 500 µM, approximately matching the concentrations required to produce anesthetic and GABAergic responses. X-ray crystal structures were determined for the complexes of apoferritin with thiopental and pentobarbital at resolutions of 1. 9 and 2. 0 Å, respectively. These structures reveal that the barbiturates bind to a cavity in the apoferritin shell that also binds haloalkanes, <b>halogenated</b> <b>ethers,</b> and propofol. Unlike these other general anesthetics, however, which rely entirely upon van der Waals interactions and the hydrophobic effect for recognition, the barbiturates are recognized in the apoferritin site using a mixture of both polar and nonpolar interactions. These results suggest that any protein binding site that is able to recognize {{and respond to the}} chemically and structurally diverse set of compounds used as general anesthetics is likely to include a versatile mixture of both polar and hydrophobic elements...|$|R

Laurencia, which is a species of marine red algae produces an astonishingly diverse array of halogenated acetogenic natural products, including 7 -, 8 - and 9 -membered medium-ring ethers, as well 11 - and 12 -membered ether-containing macrocycles. Part I of this thesis provides an alternative biogenesis to the long-standing Irie-Murai biogenesis for the <b>halogenated</b> medium-ring <b>ether</b> natural products. The Irie-Murai biogenesis proposes that diol containing compounds undergo an electrophilic bromoetherification reaction to produce the various compounds, whereas we instead postulate that the compounds arise from electrophilic bromonium ion-assisted ring-opening of an enantiopure epoxide. Some initial studies on a model system for the key bromonium ion-assisted epoxide ringopening reaction are described, including an interesting concentration effect. The synthesis of an enantioenriched epoxy-diene precursor to cyclisation is discussed, where a regioselective asymmetric homoallylic epoxidation reaction was required. Some initial unsuccessful cyclisation attempts are presented, as is a successful cyclisation in which bromine-containing 7 -, 8 - and 9 - membered ring-ethers were produced, which represent the core motifs of 5 structurally-diverse natural products. Initial studies to prepare the novel β,γ-epoxy-enyne motif which is found in our proposed biogenetic precursor are also described, culminating in the synthesis of a model system. Part II of this thesis {{is a continuation of}} on-going work within this group towards the total synthesis of the obtusallene family of natural products, the halogenated macrocyclic natural products mentioned above. The gram-scale optimisation of reactions involving late-stage intermediates in the total synthesis of obtusallenes II and IV is described. This includes improving the reproducibility of a biomimetic bromoetherification reaction, as well as providing insight into the mechanism of an interesting cyanation reaction which is a synthetically-useful adaptation of a known procedure. Also, an interesting diastereomer-dependent and catalyst-dependent ring-closing metathesis reaction is discussed. Synthetic routes to highly advanced macrocyclic intermediates in the synthesis of obtusallenes II and IV have now been firmly established. Imperial Users onl...|$|R
