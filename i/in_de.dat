5|$|Another {{educational}} work is De schematibus et tropis sacrae scripturae, which {{discusses the}} Bible's use of rhetoric. Bede {{was familiar with}} pagan authors such as Virgil, {{but it was not}} considered appropriate to teach biblical grammar from such texts, and <b>in</b> <b>De</b> schematibus... Bede argues for the superiority of Christian texts in understanding Christian literature. Similarly, his text on poetic metre uses only Christian poetry for examples.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} Bede wrote the Historia Ecclesiastica, {{there were two}} common ways of {{referring}} to dates. One was to use indictions, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD. There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year. The other approach was to use regnal years—the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion. This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date {{would have to be}} given in the regnal years of all the kings involved. Bede used both these approaches on occasion, but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the Anno Domini method invented by Dionysius Exiguus. Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it, and his promulgation of it <b>in</b> <b>De</b> Temporum Ratione, his work on chronology, is the main reason why it is now so widely used. Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle, contained <b>in</b> <b>De</b> Temporum Ratione, was developed from Dionysius Exiguus’ famous Easter table.|$|E

5|$|Completed between September and October 1941, Soeara Berbisa {{featured}} keroncong {{music and}} was shot partly in western Java.

5|$|Einstein was {{now without}} a {{permanent}} home, unsure {{where he would}} live and work, and equally worried {{about the fate of}} countless other scientists still in Germany.

In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside London, with photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein, published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} peace with Sviatoslav would not endure, the Byzantine emperor induced the Pecheneg khan Kurya to kill Sviatoslav before he reached Kiev. This was {{in line with the}} policy {{outlined}} by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus <b>in</b> <b>De</b> Administrando Imperio of fomenting strife between the Rus' and the Pechenegs. According to the Slavic chronicle, Sveneld attempted to warn Sviatoslav to avoid the Dnieper rapids, but the prince slighted his wise advice and was ambushed and slain by the Pechenegs when he tried to cross the cataracts near Khortitsa early in 972. The Primary Chronicle reports that his skull was made into a chalice by the Pecheneg khan.|$|E

5|$|French typefounders of the 16th century assiduously {{examined}} Manutius's work (and, it is thought, De Aetna in particular) as {{a source}} of inspiration. This examination extended to in some cases copying his first 'M' shown <b>in</b> <b>De</b> Aetna which had no serif pointing out of the letter at top right, a design considered very eccentric. (It has been suggested {{to be the result of}} defective casting, especially since Manutius' later fonts do not show it.) The Griffo font was only cut in a single size, so French punchcutters made modified versions of the design to suit different sizes, with a more delicate structure at larger sizes.|$|E
5|$|Heine's prose passage <b>in</b> <b>De</b> l'Allemagne {{tells of}} supernatural young women called the Wilis.

In another book, the Wilis are said to be jilted young women who have died and become vampires. This is assumed to be the reason that they hate men.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{the teachings}} of Galen {{continued}} to dominate the academic community and his doctrines were adopted as the official canon of the Church.

5|$|In early April 1993, the Armenian forces {{captured}} Kelbajar, a city {{outside the}} originally contested areas, causing international {{attention to the}} conflict.

On 5 May, the Bishkek Protocol was signed by {{the heads of the}} parliaments of Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, backed by Armenia, established de facto control of these lands.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{historical records}} of herbs are found from the Sumerian civilisation, {{where hundreds of}} medicinal plants including opium are listed on clay tablets. The Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt describes over 850 plant medicines, while Dioscorides documented over 1000 recipes for medicines using over 600 medicinal plants <b>in</b> <b>De</b> materia medica, forming the basis of pharmacopoeias for some 1500 years. Drug research makes use of ethnobotany to search for pharmacologically active substances in nature, and has in this way discovered hundreds of useful compounds. These include the common drugs aspirin, digoxin, quinine, and opium. The compounds found in plants are of many kinds, but most are in four major biochemical classes, the alkaloids, glycosides, polyphenols, and terpenes.|$|E
