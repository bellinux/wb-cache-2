50|$|Membrane {{proteins}} {{are inherently}} <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> design, {{in large part}} because it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> validate the designs experimentally for several reasons. Membrane proteins are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> purify. Their structure is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> characterize because they adopt their native conformation only {{in the presence of a}} membrane. Crystallization is inherently hard, and NMR studies of membrane proteins can fail because of their size.|$|R

5|$|In {{the months}} before departure, funds for the {{expedition}} became <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> acquire.

5|$|Certain {{bird species}} {{associate}} with the Central American squirrel monkey. The birds follow the monkeys {{in an attempt to}} prey on insects and small vertebrates that the monkeys flush out. At Corcovado National Park, bird species known to regularly follow squirrel monkeys include the double-toothed kite, the grey-headed tanager and the tawny-winged woodcreeper, but other woodcreepers and such species as motmots and trogons do so as well. This activity increases during the wet season, when arthropods are <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> find.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} game was generally positive. Reviews praised the game's formula, including its open-ended nature {{and its ability to}} immerse the player into the game. Criticism targeted the game's lack of documentation, which some reviewers found made it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> learn how to play the game. The in-game speed was also criticized for being too slow, which was a crucial issue in the game because time must pass for the player to earn income to purchase new facilities.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Hungarian {{mathematician}} Pál Turán {{was forced}} {{to work in a}} brick factory, pushing wagon loads of bricks from kilns to storage sites. The factory had tracks from each kiln to each storage site, and the wagons were <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> push at the points where tracks crossed each other. Turán was inspired by this situation to ask how the factory might be redesigned to minimize the number of crossings between these tracks.|$|E
5|$|Ebert was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for Maxivision 48, in which the movie projector runs at 48 frames per second, {{as compared to the}} usual 24 frames per second. He was opposed to the practice whereby theatres lower the intensity of their projector bulbs in order to extend the life of the bulb, arguing that this has little effect other than to make the film <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> see. Ebert was skeptical of the recent resurgence of 3D effects in film, which he found unrealistic and distracting.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, modules whose {{implementation}} is {{tangled with}} crosscutting concerns are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> reuse in different contexts. Crosscutting impedes reuse of components. The lack of interfaces between crosscutting concerns and other modules makes it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> represent and reason about the overall architecture of a system. As {{the concern is}} not modularized, the interactions between the concern and the top-level components of the system are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> represent explicitly. Hence, these concerns become <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> reason about because the dependencies between crosscutting concerns and components are not specified.|$|R
5|$|European nightjars hunt by sight, silhouetting {{their prey}} against the night sky. They tend to flycatch from a perch on moonlit nights, but fly {{continuously}} on darker nights when prey is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> see. Hunting frequency reduces {{in the middle}} of the night. Although they have very small bills, the mouth can be opened very wide as they catch insects. They have long sensitive bristles around the mouth, which may help to locate or funnel prey into the mouth. Indigestible parts of insects, such as the chitin exoskeleton, are regurgitated as pellets.|$|E

Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E
