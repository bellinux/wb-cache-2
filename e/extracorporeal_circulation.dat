25|$|UD {{requires}} {{the establishment of}} an <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>circulation</b> through its unique AV loop with two pre-existing arterial and central venous lines in ICU patients. When the saline indicator is injected into the AV loop, it is detected by the venous clamp-on sensor on the loop before it enters the patient’s heart's right atrium. After the indicator traverses the heart and lung, the concentration curve in the arterial line is recorded and displayed on the COstatus HCM101 Monitor. Cardiac output is calculated from the area of the concentration curve using the Stewart-Hamilton equation. UD is a non-invasive procedure, requiring only a connection to the AV loop and two lines from a patient. UD has been specialised for application in pediatric ICU patients and has been demonstrated to be relatively safe although invasive and reproducible.|$|E

They re-corded transient signals {{at the time of}} releasing common carotid cross clamps and inferred that these were due to microbubbles. Similar signals at other times were assumed also to be indicative of emboli, although of unproven constitution. They suggested that the usefulness of this technique might be extended to cardiac sources of embolism. We have recently concluded such a study. 2 Transcranial Doppler (TC 2 - 64 EME) was used to record middle cerebral artery flow velocity before, during, and immediately after bypass during coronary artery surgery. Continuously recorded velocities from the right MCA were averaged over 30 seconds and stored on an Apple 2 e micro-computer. The software also detected high-amplitude transients (more than twice the amplitude under steady-flow conditions) and recorded their number over each 30 -second period. High-amplitude signals were common at the time of aortic cannulation and at the inception of bypass, but were also recorded during stable bypass. In vitro studies by ourselves 3 and others 4 using model <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>circulations</b> show that the signal characteristic recorded during surgery can be attributed to microemboli.

As protease/antiprotease system, elastase and alpha 1 -antitrypsin were used. The concentration of active elastase in aqueous solutions decreased as function of contact time with the membrane, approaching saturation. A 40 % loss of elastase activity was obtained at pH 7. 4, which was not due to autolysis, which accounted for 5 % of the loss. The highest reduction was achieved at pH 9. 0 (25 % higher than at pH 7. 4). The saturation level of elastase decrease, calculated by means of the Einstein equation, was reached after more than 47 minutes. We speculate that a time reduction might be achieved either increasing the concentration of immobilized antiproteases, or increasing the rate of elastase movement across the membranes by hydraulic, osmotic, or temperature gradients.

By the adjustment of these parameters, cellulose fibers containing desired amounts of immobilized protamine (ranging from 1 to 20 mg of immobilized protamine per gram of dry fibers) were readily prepared. Heparin adsorption to the protamine-bound cellulose fibers was also examined. The adsorption isotherm followed a Langmuir adsorption model. The amount of heparin adsorbed was dependent on both the heparin concentration in the substrate solution and the protamine loading on the fibers.

Collectively, these events can result in the release of micromolar quantities of redox active iron and copper. Bleomycin-detectable iron and phenanthroline-detectable copper were found in two out of four mock bypass experiments. However, there was no correlation between the presence of chelatable iron and copper and the activation of neutrophils measured as elastase...|$|R
40|$|Hemodialysis {{treatment}} {{requires a}} patient’s blood circulation {{to be connected}} to artificial kidney <b>extracorporeal</b> (EC) <b>circulation</b> through a vascular access. In chronic patients, the vascular access is normally created by an artero-venous (AVF) fistula, where part of the peripheral arterial blood flows along a venous vessel. The connection is made by inserting two needles into the venous vessel. Blood is drawn to the EC along the arterial needle and is returned to the patient along the venous needle. In this study, we simulated the hemodynamics of vascular access with particular focus on the region downstream to the venous needle in order to analyze the influence of return flow (Qb) on blood circulation. A three dimensional CFD model of vascular access circulation was developed and various blood flow conditions were simulated. Simulation results predicted a critical circulation downstream to the needle tip due to the confluence between the return flow and the access flow. A vortex recirculation was evident in this region. Vortex extension appeared only for Qb values higher than 40 % of the access flow and was limited to a zone few centimetres from the needle tip in the downstream direction. CFD simulations allowed a detailed study of the complex hemodynamics in the vascular access region surrounding the inserted needle which would otherwise be difficult to measure experimentally...|$|R

In this study the biocompatibility of a covalently end-point-attached heparin coating was analyzed in different in-vitro and in-vivo-models considering coagulation and complement systems. Mechanism inhibiting the activation on HBS were examined. An in-vitro-model integrating a roller pump and an arterial blood filter was filled with human blood. After heparin coating of whole circuit as well as isolated coating of arterial filter blood coagulation was less activated, but only modifying all blood contacting surfaces reduced complement activation. To examine mechanism of reduced complement activation heparin coated and unmodified surfaces were simultaneously tested in an in-vitro-study with a closed tube-circuit ("Chandler-Loop") filled with human blood. Significantly increased binding of complement inhibitors C 1 Inhibitor and factor H on HBS lead to significantly reduced detection of activation specific complement proteins (iC 3 b and C 5 b- 9) demonstrating reduced complement activation. Analysis of alternative C 3 -convertase and soluble terminal complement complex in blood revealed decreased activation for HBS. In-vivo-experiments with adult sheep compared ECMO with HBS or with unmodified surfaces for 120 hrs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{present their}} 35 -year {{experience}} with intra-arterial chemotherapeutic regional perfusion of 1139 patients with melanomas, using an extracorporeal oxygenated circuit and heart-lung apparatus. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Intra-arterial chemotherapy produces improved responses in many tumors. By isolating and sustaining {{the area with}} <b>extracorporeal</b> oxygenated <b>circulation,</b> high doses can be delivered to the tumor area, limited only by local toxicity. Drug levels up to 10 times those achieved by systemic administration are obtained. METHODS: Techniques for hyperthermic perfusion were developed for limbs, pelvis, head, neck, and skin of the breast. Melphalan (Burroughs Wellcome, Research Triangle Park, NC) was used in 753 patients. Combinations with melphalan or other drugs were used in remaining cases at temperature of 38 to 40 C for 30 to 60 minutes. RESULTS: Chemotherapy perfusion followed by tumor excision or node dissection, was performed where indicated. The cumulative 10 -year survival for patients with localized melanomas was 70 %. For patients with local recurrences or satellites within 3 cm, survival was 61 %. For those with regionally confined intransit tumors, survival was 30 %; for those with regional node involvement, 38 %; for those with intransit and nodal metastases, 16 %; for those with distant metastases and perfusion [...] mainly to save functional limbs [...] survival was 7 %. Multiple perfusions were performed in 158 patients with recurrent disease on 366 occasions. Patients with indolent regionally confined melanomas were benefited by prolongation of useful life. CONCLUSIONS: Safe perfusion techniques are available for most anatomic regions. Increased chemotherapeutic doses are delivered to isolated areas limited only by local toxicity. Adjunct perfusion in poor prognosis stage I cases is useful in reducing local recurrence, and intransit or lymph node metastases. Regional perfusion reduces the need for major amputation.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the functional and metabolic consequences of imposing a chronic external coronary stenosis around the left anterior descending coronary artery for 4 days in an intact pig model. BackgroundA clinical condition termed hibernating myocardium has been described wherein {{as a result of}} chronic sustained or intermittent coronary hypoperfusion, heart muscle minimizes energy demands by decreasing mechanical function and thus avoids cell death. The use of chronic animal models to simulate this disorder may assist in establishing causative associations among determinants to explain this phenomenon. MethodsA hydraulic cuff occluder was placed around the left anterior descending coronary artery in eight pigs. Coronary flow velocity was reduced by a mean (±SE) of 49 ± 5 % of prestenotic values, as estimated by a Doppler velocity probe. After 4 days the pigs were prepared with <b>extracorporeal</b> coronary <b>circulation</b> and evaluated at flow conditions dictated by the cuff occluder. Substrate utilizations were described using equilibrium labeling with [U- 14 C]palmitate and [5 - 3 H]glucose. Results were compared with a combined group of 21 acute and chronic (4 day) sham animals. ResultsFour days of partial coronary stenosis significantly decreased regional systolic shortening by 54 %. Myocardial oxygen consumption was maintained at aerobic levels, and rest coronary flows were normal. Fatty acid oxidation was decreased by 43 % below composite sham values, and exogenous glucose utilization was increased severalfold. Alterations in myocardial metabolism were accompanied by a decline in tissue content of adenosine triphosphate. ConclusionsThese data suggest that chronic coronary stenosis in the absence of macroscarring imparts an impairment in mechanical function, whereas coronary flow and myocardial oxygen consumption are preserved at rest. The increases in glycolytic flux of exogenous glucose are similar to observations on glucose uptake assessed by fluorine- 18 2 -deoxy- 2 -fluoro-d-glucose in patients with advanced coronary artery disease. We speculate that intermittent episodes of ischemia and reperfusion are the cause of this phenomenon...|$|R
