40|$|Seasonal {{variation}} in seed bank size and species composition of five selected habitat types within the Tembe Elephant Park. South Africa, was investigated. At three-month intervals, soil samples were randomly collected from five different habitat types: a, Licuati forest; b, Licuati thicket; c, a bare or sparsely vegetated zone surrounding the forest edge, {{referred to as}} the forest/grassland ecotone; d, grassland; and e, open woodland. Most species in the seed bank flora were either grasses, sedges, or forbs, with hardly any evidence of woody species. The Licuati forest and thicket soils produced the lowest seed densities in all seasons.   Licuati forest and <b>grassland</b> <b>seed</b> banks showed a two-fold seasonal {{variation in}} size, those of the Licuati thicket and woodland a three-fold variation in size, whereas the forest/grassland ecotone maintained a relatively large seed bank all year round.

Seed availability is a potential limiting factor in vegetation recovery in such landscapes. To assess {{the quantity and quality}} of the seed rain of woody taxa, seed traps were placed in the major upland vegetation types: fire-maintained grassland, shrubland, and secondary forest. Within the grassland site, traps were placed under isolated trees, isolated male and female shrubs of Eurya chinensis, and in the open. Seeds were collected every 2 weeks for 2 years. The seed rain was highest under female shrubs in <b>grassland</b> (6455 <b>seeds</b> m - 2 year - 1), where it was almost entirely confined to their fruiting period.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{contribute}} to the understanding of how the response of communities (above and below ground) to environment degradation are reflected in seed banks and, how this knowledge can be used to suggest improved application of ecological restoration processes. Two study areas were selected, one at Buxton Climate Change Impacts Laboratory, a site near Buxton, and the other at Wardlow Hay-Cop, in Cressbrook Dale National Nature Reserve, both located in the Derbyshire, UK. This study is organized in the following four sections. I. Chapter 11 examines the impact of the long-term management and changes in precipitation on calcareous <b>grassland</b> <b>seed</b> banks. More than two decades of dereliction have had the largest effects followed by the effects of more than ten years of summer drought. Both changed species composition and, declined seed abundance. In addition, species richness decreased in dereliction. 3. Chapter III investigates the effects of the long-term nitrogen deposition on acid <b>grassland</b> <b>seed</b> banks. More than one decade of N deposition caused shifts in species composition. decrease richness, seed density and. the abundance of functional groups. Moreover, seed bank populations were unable to recover after more than 4 years of ceasing N deposition. 4. Chapter IV explores the effects of soil pH on seed persistence. Seed density, grasses seed abundance the probability that Hypericum pulchrum seeds persist declined as soil pH increased. 5. Chapter V investigates {{the extent to which the}} intraspecific trait variation in the same community differs between the components of mature plant population and seed bank, arising from a possible trade-off between investment in seed banks and vegetative growth. Seed bank were not representative of mature plant population. Overall, larger individuals invested more in sexual reproduction than the smaller and, per unit of total biornass, seed- originating individuals invested more in vegetative than in reproductive traits. Therefore, there is no evidence of the potential trade-off between investment in seed banks (via seed production) and vegetative growth in the calcareous grassland species at Buxton. We concluded that the potential of seed banks to assist the restoration is lower in calcareous than acid grass lands. Moreover, the relevance of seed banks is lower in those affected by dereliction and summer drought and, in acid grass lands affected by N deposition the potential is very limited. In addition, the genetic diversity of calcareous grassland species cannot be recovered by using seed banks. Therefore, the recovery of seed banks and above-ground vegetation should be integrated together into restoration programmes. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Forage herbs may be included in <b>grassland</b> <b>seed</b> mixtures to improve herbage mineral content, although there is limited information about mineral concentrations in forage herbs. To determine whether herbs have greater macro- and micromineral concentrations than forage legumes and grasses, we conducted a 2 -year experiment on a loamy-sand site in Denmark sown with a multi-species mixture comprised of three functional groups (grasses, legumes and herbs). Herb species included chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.), caraway (Carum carvi L.) and salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor L.). We also investigated the effect of slurry application on the macro- and micromineral concentration of grasses, legumes and herbs. In general, herbs had greater concentrations of the macrominerals P, Mg, K and S and the microminerals Zn and B than grasses and legumes.

Besides, the mixture of P. persimilis and N. californicus proved to be very effective. During samplings of the undersown crop of tall fescue in spring, predatory mites were recorded in low numbers. This is evidence that tall fescue can serve as a hibernation quarter for predatory mites. More studies are however needed to give more detailed answers to this thematic constellation...|$|E

The germination response to heat shock (80 °C – 5 min), smoke (60 min), the combination of both factors and no heat no smoke (control) was studied in six native species (two dominant grasses, two dominant shrubs and two annual fugitive herbs) of northwestern Patagonian <b>grasslands.</b> <b>Seeds</b> of the grasses Festuca pallescens and Stipa speciosa and the shrub Senecio bracteolatus (Asteraceae) germinated when they were exposed to heat shock, whereas seeds of the other shrub, Mulinum spinosum (Apiaceae), were killed by this fire cue. In grasses, probably the glume of caryopsis protected embryos from heat. Possibly, the seed size could explain the different responses of the two shrubs. Heat combined with smoke reduced seed germination for S. speciosa and S. bracteolatus. The heat could have scarified seeds and the longer exposure to smoke could have been toxic for embryos. The same treatment increased germination of the annual fugitive herb Boopis gracilis (Calyceraceae).

40|$|Open savannas and wet grasslands {{are present}} {{under the same}} {{seasonal}} macro-climate in central Brazil. However, in open savannas, temperatures during fires are higher than in wet grasslands. Grasses dominate both ecosystems and exhibit large variation in seed dormancy. We hypothesise that seeds of grass species from open savannas are more tolerant to heating than those of wet grasslands. Also, assuming that dormant seeds remain longer in the soil than non-dormant seeds - thus being more likely to burn - we expect that dormant seeds are more tolerant to heating than non-dormant seeds. We tested the effects of heating at 80 and 110 °C for 2. 5 and 5. 0 min on the survival of seeds of 14 species, seven from each community, containing dormant and non-dormant species. Seeds of most species survived at 80 °C, but seeds from open savannas maintained greater survival for 5 min than <b>seeds</b> from wet <b>grasslands.</b> <b>Seeds</b> of most species died at 110 °C, but dormant seeds survived more than non-dormant seeds.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} methods of reconstruction and different seed mixtures on {{the restoration of}} botanically valuable, semi-natural, species- rich grasslands on enlarged river dikes (embankments) was studied. If during the reconstruction a strip of the species-rich vegetation is kept unaffected it functions {{as a source of}} propagules. From this intact zone species disperse {{to other parts of the}} dike and the redevelopment of the vegetation is stimulated. When it is not possible to save part of the original vegetation, the upper soil layer can be put aside as complete sods or as topsoil and can be replaced as the new topsoil after the reconstruction. In this way the redevelopment of species-rich grasslands is promoted by the reestablishment of previously occurring species out of the propagules present in the replaced top soil. The application of the original subsoil or the use of imported clay as the new toplayer prevent a quick restoration of botanically valuable, semi-natural, species-rich <b>grasslands.</b> <b>Seed</b> mixtures applied influence the development of succession. Redevelopment of former river dike grasslands is quickest if D 1 LGM (i. e., standard seed mixture plus locally gathered seed mixture) is used as a seed mixture.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Grassland</b> <b>seed</b> {{banks are}} {{traditionally}} considered {{a source of}} new species in degraded communities. However, many {{recent studies have shown}} that the potential of the seed bank to restore many communities is rather limited. Two principal reasons for these limitations, loss of species from the seed bank or inability of the species to create any seed bank, are, however, usually not distinguished. This study aims to assess the role of seed bank composition and heterogeneity in the restoration of species-rich plant communities. It was carried out in mountain grasslands in the eastern part of the Krkonoše Mountains, Czech Republic. The composition of vegetation and seed bank were recorded and their relationship was assessed in 1. 5 m 1. 5 m plots placed in non-degraded and degraded parts of seven grasslands. Vegetation at currently managed sites is not degraded; degraded parts were without management (dominated by Holcus mollis, Bistorta major or Rumex alpinus). The degree of heterogeneity of seed bank and vegetation was tested as the relationship between subplot similarity, distance, and degradation stage. Degradation had significant effects on composition of both aboveground vegetation and seed bank and increased heterogeneity both in the vegetation and in the seed bank. Species absent from the vegetation of degraded plots were also absent from the seed bank of both degraded and non-degraded plots, indicating that the absence of species from the seed bank is not due to their loss during the degradation process but rather due to th...|$|E

We test the prediction that smaller distances between neighboring seeds in drill seeded grassland plantings would result in lower species diversity, greater weed abundance, and larger conspecific patch sizes than otherwise similar broadcast seeded plantings. A diverse <b>grassland</b> <b>seed</b> mix was either drill seeded, which places seeds in equally spaced rows, or broadcast seeded, which spreads seeds across the ground surface, into 24 plots in each of three sites in 2005. In summer 2007, we measured species abundance in a 1 m 2 quadrat in each plot and mapped common species within the quadrat by recording the most abundant species in each of 64 cells. Quadrat-scale diversity and weed abundance were similar between drilled and broadcast plots, suggesting that processes that limited establishment and controlled invasion were not affected by such fine-scale seed distribution. However, native warm-season (C 4) grasses were more abundant and occurred in less compact patches in drilled plots. This difference in C 4 grass abundance and distribution may result from increased germination or vegetative propagation of C 4 grasses in drilled plots. Our findings suggest that local plant density may control fine-scale heterogeneity and species composition in restored grasslands, processes {{that need to be}} further investigated to determine whether seed distributions can be manipulated to increase diversity in restored grasslands...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{relative}} importance of distance (geographical or ecological) as a consideration when collecting seeds for restoration projects, {{there is a need for}} more research on regional and ecotypic variation in a range of species. We used Lotus corniculatus L., a legume frequently included in <b>grassland</b> <b>seed</b> mixes, to investigate phenotypic variation between British accessions in a common garden experiment. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of seed origin on plant phenotype and fecundity and to determine whether there was any evidence of correlation with distance (geographical or ecological) in populations grown from seed collected from different locations. Regional differences were detected in plant size, growth habit, pubescence, leaf shape, and fecundity. Geographical distance between sites was shown to be positively correlated with an increased difference in seed yield. Differences in size, growth habit, and leaf shape between paired habitats of origin within region and also between “ecotypes” were evident. However, there was no correlation between ecological distance and any of the measured traits. These findings suggest that: 1. Differences in phenotype and fecundity between geographically separated populations of L. corniculatus may be sufficient to lead to differences in survival and fitness when seeds are sown in a restoration environment. 2. Although it is important to consider geographical location, the choice of habitat within region is also important because phenotypic variation between ecotypes may have long-term consequences for plant persistence. ...|$|E

Because beech is poorly adapted to fire, and is slow to regenerate, forest is normally replaced by scrub or <b>grassland.</b> <b>Seeding</b> was investigated {{as a means of}} restoring mountain beech (N. solandri var. cliffortioides) forest after fire destroyed 300 ha of forest at Mt. Thomas, Canterbury, in 1980. A mixture of mountain beech, Leptospermum scoparium and other small tree and shrub species was sown within a year of the fire in the presence and absence of pasture species as a cover crop, and fertiliser. Seeding of mountain beech and L. scoparium was successful, but other species were of limited success. Competition from pasture species inhibited establishment of all native species. Fertiliser increased L. scoparium plant numbers in the first year but had no other beneficial effect on establishment of native species. Leptospermum scoparium provided a dense shrub cover in plots where the native species were sown in the absence of pasture species, but mountain beech had begun to overtop the shrub canopy by 20 years after seeding. Browsing by insects or small animals in the first 2 years is suggested as the main cause of mortality in mountain beech. Mountain beech seeded at 1. 4 kg/ha resulted in about 1800 saplings/ha at age 20. It is suggested that seeding the wider burn area more than 2 years after the fire would have been unsuccessful because of competition from herbaceous species, especially Agrostis capillaris, which rapidly invaded the burnt area. A strategy is outlined for establishing mountain beech over large areas when limited quantities of seed are available...|$|R
40|$|Survival {{of seeds}} in the seed bank is {{important}} for the population dynamics of many plant species, yet the environmental factors that control seed survival at a landscape level remain poorly understood. These factors may include soil moisture, vegetation cover, soil type, and soil pathogens. Because many soil fungi respond to moisture and host species, fungi may mediate environmental drivers of seed survival. Here, I measure patterns of seed survival in California annual grassland plants across 15 species in three experiments. First, I surveyed seed survival for eight species at 18 grasslands and coastal sage scrub sites ranging across coastal and inland Santa Barbara County, California. Species differed in seed survival, and soil moisture and geographic location had the strongest influence on survival. Grasslands had higher survival than coastal sage scrub sites for some species. Second, I used a fungicide addition and exotic grass thatch removal experiment in the field to tease apart the relative impact of fungi, thatch, and their interaction in an invaded <b>grassland.</b> <b>Seed</b> survival was lower in the winter (wet season) than in the summer (dry season), but fungicide improved winter survival. Seed survival varied between species but did not depend on thatch. Third, I manipulated water and fungicide in the laboratory to directly examine the relationship between water, fungi, and survival. Seed survival declined from dry to single watered to continuously watered treatments. Fungicide slightly improved seed survival when seeds were watered once but not continually. Together, these experiments demonstrate an important role of soil moisture, potentially mediated by fungal pathogens, in driving seed survival...|$|E

S. Moore, and Dimocarps longan Lour.) for restoring these lands. The limited rate of seed dispersal of woody plants {{was the most important}} barrier for tree establishment at the study site.    Only 0. 3 % of the <b>grassland</b> <b>seed</b> rain comprised woody plant seeds, and only one seed each from two late successional tree species were recorded as dispersing into the grassland during an 18 month period.   Seedling emergence by woody plants was lower in the grassland (mean 0. 02 m - 2 yr - 1) than in adjacent forest (mean 6. 03 m - 2 y - 1).   Photosynthetically active radiation, air temperature and soil temperature at ground level were significantly higher for the grassland than the forest.   Herbivory had a more pronounced negative effect on the emergence of woody plants in the grassland than did fire.

The behaviour {{of the head and}} back fires was also monitored. Soil seed bank samples were collected immediately after burning and then every third month over a two-year period from 0. 25 m 2 blocks 50 mm deep. The same was done on unburnt grassland. At ground level, the back fire exceeded 100 °C, while the head fire had temperatures of less than 100 °C. The fire caused a flush of seedlings from the seed bank over the first season after the fire. The head fire stimulated seedling density significantly (P ≤ 0. 01) more than the back fire. The mean (head and back fire) seed bank density the first season following the fire, for burnt and unburnt grassland, was respectively 84. 6 and 52. 1 grass seedlings m− 2 for September, 50. 5 and 21. 9 grass seedlings m− 2 for December and 347 and 58 grass seedlings m− 2 for March.

However, soil disturbance generally has {{the greatest impact on}} biological properties, including both free and symbiotic fungal populations. Interest in more ecologically sustainable agricultural systems is rising with increasing recognition that agricultural intensification can adversely affect environmental quality. This paper discusses the effect of tillage system on some soil characteristics, such as pH, C, N and S levels, total and Olsen-P contents including some P forms associated with organic matter, glomalin contents and arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) parameters, such as root colonization, spore number and total and active hyphal length. Measurements were in the sixth year of an on-going tillage-rotation experiment conducted on an Ultisol under no-till (NT), reduced tillage (RT) and conventional tillage with stubble mixed into the soil (CTS) or stubble burnt (CTB). Soil was sampled at two dates; after wheat (Triticum aestivum) harvest (autumn) and 6 months after subsequent <b>grassland</b> <b>seeding</b> (spring). Higher C, N, S, total P and fulvic acid-P concentrations and pH occurred under NT and RT than under CTS and CTB after wheat harvest. However, results at the second sampling were not consistent. AM spore number and active hyphal length were highest under NT having the greatest incidence on AM root colonization and P concentration in shoots of the pasture. Glomalin concentration was higher under NT and RT than under CTS and CTB but no differences in calculated glomalin to total C (ca. 5 %) were found. It is concluded that a less disruptive effect of NT influences positively all soil characteristics and also increases P acquisition by the following crop in the rotation system...|$|R

40|$|Questions: In {{temperate}} <b>grasslands,</b> <b>seeds</b> {{of numerous}} dry-fruited plant species are dispersed via ingestion and subsequent defecation by grazing animals. Depending on the herbivore species and season, dung pats may contain a large assemblage of conspecific or heterospecific seeds competing for space, light and nutrients in the space-limited environment {{of an individual}} dung pat. In an environment rich in nutrients, such as herbivore dung, the outcome of inter- and intraspecific competition might differ from situations where nutrients are limiting. Additionally, dung pats being small and spatially isolated habitats with very specific conditions may also impact competitive interactions. Besides the plant-soil interactions on competition known from literature, the specific quality and structure of dung pats might provoke more complex interactions between different seed densities and species combinations. Methods: We conducted a greenhouse competition experiment using three common perennial grassland species. Agrostis stolonifera, Trifolium pratense and Trifolium repens were used in two-species combinations with different proportions of each species and in monocultures. Seeds were sown in three seed densities (50, 150 and 250 seeds) {{and the effects of}} cattle and horse dung on establishment, growth and flowering were tested. Results: Interactions, most probably attributable to interspecific competition, differed between species mixtures. Seeds sown in polycultures generally emerged sooner, but the resulting seedlings had lower relative growth rates compared with seeds sown in monocultures. Increased biomass was measured for each species when growing in polycultures while evidence for intraspecific competition was found in monocultures. T. pratense developed relatively more flowers when plants were growing in polycultures compared with monocultures. Few effects of seed densities were found, although higher seed densities led to lower establishment success in both monocultures and polycultures. Adding dung generally increased the time needed to emerge, relative growth rates and flowering, but decreased establishment success in monocultures. Conclusions: Both seed density and the presence of dung shape the post-dispersal fate of seeds. While high seed densities imply a cost due to lower germinability, the nutritive environment of dung acts as compensation, resulting in faster growth and an increased investment in reproductive tissues...|$|R
40|$|Grassland for {{livestock}} production {{is a major}} form of land use throughout Europe and its intensive management threatens biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in agricultural landscapes. Modest increases to conventional grassland biodiversity could have considerable positive impacts on the provision of ecosystem services, such as pollination, to surrounding habitats. Using a field-scale experiment in which <b>grassland</b> <b>seed</b> mixes and sward management were manipulated, complemented by surveys on working farms and phytometer experiments, the impact of conventional grassland diversity and management on the functional diversity and ecosystem service provision of pollinator communities were investigated. Increasing plant richness, {{by the addition of}} both legumes and forbs, was associated with significant enhancements in the functional diversity of grassland pollinator communities. This was associated with increased temporal stability of flower–visitor interactions at the community level. Visitation networks revealed pasture species Taraxacum sp. (Wigg.) (dandelion) and Cirsium arvense (Scop.) (creeping thistle) to have the highest pollinator visitation frequency and richness. Cichorium intybus (L.) (chichory) was highlighted as an important species having both high pollinator visitation and desirable agronomic properties. Increased sward richness was associated with an increase in the pollination of two phytometer species; Fragaria × ananassa (strawberry) and Silene dioica (red campion), but not Vicia faba (broad bean). Enhanced functional diversity, richness and abundance of the pollinator communities associated with more diverse neighbouring pastures were found to be potential mechanisms for improved pollination. Synthesis and applications. A modest increase in conventional grassland plant diversity with legumes and forbs, achievable with the expertise and resources available to most grassland farmers, could enhance pollinator functional diversity, richness and abundance. Moreover, our results suggest that this could improve pollination services and consequently surrounding crop yields (e. g. strawberry) and wildflower reproduction in agro-ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Bees {{and other}} flower-visiting insects are {{experiencing}} periods of food shortage, particularly in intensively managed agricultural landscapes in Europe. As {{part of the}} Danish project EcoServe ([URL] we therefore investigated whether increased richness of selected herbaceous species in organic hay fields acted as a floral resource thus enhancing abundance and biodiversity of pollinators. Moreover, we investigated if availability of floral resources was affected by cutting regime (timing and number of cuttings during the growing season) in 11 herbaceous species, which are often used in <b>grassland</b> <b>seed</b> mixtures. In a field survey, we visited 20 organic hay meadows of different age (3 - 100 years), and conducted surveys regularly throughout the flowering season to quantify diversity of insect-pollinated plants and pollinators. Our results showed that diversity of pollinators was significantly and positively related to diversity of plants, but that hay fields embedded in a complex landscape harbored a higher diversity of both plants and insects than hay fields in more homogeneous areas. Also, diversity of plants and insects increased in older hay meadows. In an experimental set-up, we tested the availability of flowers in plots of monocultures and a mixture of 11 herbaceous species under two cutting regimes: (1) plots were cut once every four weeks throughout the growing season, and (2) plots were cut {{only at the end}} of the flowering season. While the majority of species provided flowers for pollinators when plots were not cut during the flowering season, most plant species set few if any flowers if cut frequently. One exception was Trifolium repens, which was slightly stimulated by cutting. Thus, traditional grasslands which are frequently mowed are expected to be poor in flowers. Our results suggest that it is important to leave unmowed flower-rich areas in the fields throughout the flowering season to avoid periods of food shortage. The potential for unmowed hay fields to enhance diversity and abundance of pollinators, however, depend on the composition of the surrounding landscape and age of the field. ...|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, {{agricultural}} producers and conservation organizations and agencies have converted thousands of hectares of cropland to grassland in the Great Plains. Although high diversity seed mixes can {{cost up to}} five to ten {{times as much as}} low diversity seed mixes, little information is available on the ecological functions that may result from the added diversity. Restorations that maintain critical ecological functions and services may help maintain functional and resilient working landscapes. In this dissertation I assessed the effects of tallgrass prairie plant diversity and seeding density on the provision of ecological functions and services including: 1) resistance to invasive plant species, 2) abundance and diversity of predatory invertebrates, 3) herbivory levels on two perennial forbs, and 4) soil development. In the spring of 2006, twenty-four 55 m 2 -plots were planted to six replicates in each of four treatments: high diversity sites of 97 species typically planted by The Nature Conservancy planted at a lower seeding density, high diversity sites at twice this seeding rate, and low diversity sites using a Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Conservation Reserve Program mix (CP 25; 15 species), at low and high seeding densities. This study is among the first to compare the ecological functions provided by <b>grassland</b> <b>seed</b> mixes commonly used by practitioners. Increasing plant community diversity was found to be more important than increasing seeding density for enhancing resistance to invasion by unsown perennial forbs and legumes and in reducing inflorescence production by Bromus inermis. There was a significant positive relationship between plant community diversity and the abundance of coccinellid beetles, but the abundance of ants, carabid beetles, and spiders showed no significant response to diversity or seeding density. Seeding density had a positive effect on carabid beetle and spider species richness and Shannon-Weaver diversity. Year was the main significant effect for explaining levels of herbivory damage in Ratibida columnifera and Solidago canadensis and there was a significant negative relationship between diversity and levels of soil nitrate. Overall, results indicate increasing diversity may be more important than increasing seeding density for provision of the ecological functions studied. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{expansion}} {{of land use}} for agriculture is among {{the main reasons for}} the reduction of natural grasslands around the world, and {{little is known about the}} recovery potential of original native <b>grassland</b> vegetation from <b>seed</b> banks. The aim of this study was to assess the seed bank potential of grassland areas with or without history of cultivation in southern Brazil. Specifically, we aimed at evaluating if agricultural use allowed for the persistence of species typical of natural <b>grasslands</b> in soil <b>seed</b> banks. We analyzed seed banks in two areas with a history of cultivation and in two natural grasslands. Samples were collected in spring and autumn in order to assess transient and persistent components, and were characterized by density, richness, presence of exotic species and relationship between seed bank and established vegetation. Both richness and density were high; we found a total of 114 species and a mean density of 61, 796 seedlings/m 2 for all four areas in the spring sampling. In the natural grasslands, the dominant species of established vegetation were mostly absent from the soil seed bank. Our study indicates that the seed bank is of little relevance for the recovery of typical grassland vegetation after disturbance...|$|R
40|$|Recruitment of new {{seedlings}} {{into the}} vegetation {{is essential for}} maintaining species rich plant communities. Hence it is of pivotal importance to understand factors determining seedling recruitment. Here it is tested whether arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) promote seedling recruitment in perennial <b>grassland</b> communities. <b>Seeds</b> of four plant species (two grasses and two forbs) were added to patches within 1 -year old grassland microcosms that were inoculated with different AMF taxa or to control microcosms that were not inoculated. The seedlings grew larger and obtained more phosphorus when AMF were present. Moreover, the seedlings obtained different amounts of phosphorus in microcosms inoculated with different AMF taxa. The results indicate that AMF promote seedling establishment by integrating emerging seedlings into extensive hyphal networks and by supplying nutrients to the seedlings. AMF, thus, act as a symbiotic support system that promotes seedling establishment and reduces recruitment limitation in grassland...|$|R
5000|$|The {{black-headed bunting}} {{is found in}} flocks as it forages on <b>grasslands</b> for <b>seeds.</b> They breed in summer, {{building}} a nest in a low bush or on the ground. The nest is a cup made of dry grass and lined with hair. The clutch consists of four to six eggs. The eggs hatch after about 13 days and the chicks fledge after about 10 days. Its natural food consists of insects when feeding young, and otherwise seeds. In Bulgaria, {{the collapse of the}} drying cotton thistle (Onopordum acanthium) stems on which the birds build their nests has caused high mortality; this is thought to be an example of an ecological trap. In northern Iran, there is a region of range overlap with the red-headed bunting and natural hybrids are common although molecular data indicates that there is considerable genetic divergence between the two species.|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} biomass for {{bioenergy}} has increased rapidly in industrialized {{countries in the}} recent years. Biogenic energy carriers are known to reduce CO 2 emissions. However, the resource-inefficient production of biomass often caused negative impacts on the environment, e. g. biodiversity losses, nitrate leaching, and erosion. The detrimental effects evolved mainly from annual crops. Therefore, the aim of modern bioenergy cropping systems is to combine yield stability and environmental benefits by the establishment of mixed-cropping systems. A particular emphasis is on perennial crops which are perceived as environmentally superior to annual crops. Agroforestry systems represent such mixed perennial cropping systems and consist of a mix of trees and arable crops or grassland within the same area of land. Agroforestry practices vary across the globe and alley cropping {{is a type of}} agroforestry system which is well adapted to the temperate zone, {{with a high degree of}} mechanization. Trees are planted in rows and crops are planted in the alleyways, which facilitates their management by machinery. This study was conducted to examine a young alley cropping system of willows and two grassland mixtures for bioenergy provision under temperate climate conditions. The first part of the thesis identified possible competition effects between willows and the two grassland mixtures. Since light seemed to be the factor most affecting the yield performance of the understory in temperate agroforestry systems, a biennial in situ artificial shade experiment was established over a separate clover-grass stand to quantify the effects of shade. Data to possible below- and aboveground interactions among willows and the two grassland mixtures and their effects on productivity, sward composition, and quality were monitored along a tree-grassland interface within the alleys. In the second part, productivity of the alley cropping system was examined on a triennial time frame and compared to separate grassland and willow stands as controls. Three different conversion technologies (combustion of hay, integrated generation of solid fuel and biogas from biomass, whole crop digestion) were applied to grassland biomass as feedstock and analyzed for its energetic potential. The energetic potential of willow wood chips was calculated by applying combustion as conversion technique. Net energy balances of separate grassland stands, agroforestry and pure willow stands evaluated their energy efficiency. Results of the biennial artificial shade experiment showed that severe shade (80 % light reduction) halved grassland productivity on average compared to a non-shaded control. White clover as heliophilous plant responded sensitively to limited radiation and its dry matter contribution in the sward decreased with increasing shade, whereas non-leguminous forbs (mainly segetal species) benefited. Changes in nutritive quality could not be confirmed by this experiment. Through the study on interactions within the alleys of the young agroforestry system it was possible to outline changes of incident light, soil temperature and sward composition of clover-grass along the tree-grassland interface. Nearly no effects of trees on precipitation, soil moisture and understory productivity occurred along the interface during the biennial experiment. Considering the results of the productivity and the net energy yield alley cropping system had lower than pure grassland stands, irrespective of the <b>grassland</b> <b>seed</b> mixture or fertilization, but was higher than that for pure willow stands. The comparison of three different energetic conversion techniques for the grassland biomass showed highest net energy yields for hay combustion, whereas the integrated generation of solid fuel and biogas from biomass (IFBB) and whole crop digestion performed similarly. However, due to the low fuel quality of hay, its direct combustion cannot be recommended as a viable conversion technique, whereas IFBB fuels were of a similar quality to wood chip from willow. This work was funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research...|$|E
40|$|Roadside verge {{vegetation}} is a complex, unusual community, {{poorly understood}} and researched and a typical {{example of a}} “novel ecosystem”. The land has been altered by humans, the topsoil introduced from elsewhere, a seed mixture added and a management regime implemented. Vegetation is a cost effective, sustainable method for improving slope stability on steeper roadside slopes. On newly constructed roadside verges its rapid establishment prevents soil erosion and provides an aesthetic cover. The standard grass seed mixture sown includes grass species which are quick growing, vigorous and competitive. The belowground root system increases soil strength and the aboveground canopy reduces surface erosion, although soil compaction can restrict root and shoot growth. Morphological differences between grasses and wildflowers allow the root systems to utilise different soil strata and the aboveground canopy to fully exploit aboveground niches. Therefore maybe a species-rich <b>grassland</b> <b>seed</b> mixture should be sown to improve slope stability? The BIONICS Embankment at Nafferton Farm was used to investigate aspect and soil compaction on {{the establishment of a}} species-rich grassland. A second smaller Mesocosm experiment investigated the effects of aspect, soil compaction and cutting regimes on the aboveground composition and biomass, and the belowground rooting depths of two different seed mixtures. Also a survey of the plant communities and environmental characteristics of grass cuttings was carried out along the A 303 and A 38 in Wiltshire and Devon. On the BIONICS embankment 14 generalist plant species germinated from the seed mixture and arable and injurious weeds colonised. More wildflowers, e. g. Lotus corniculatus, grew on the south-facing slopes while more grasses and some herbs, e. g. Ranunculus repens, grew on the north-facing slopes. Ellenberg Indicator Values for fertility and moisture were higher on north-facing slopes, with light values greater on south-facing slopes. Lolium perenne, Medicago lupulina and Achillea millefolium were associated with the less compacted subsoil. In the Mesocosm experiment, L. perenne, Cynosurus cristatus, Phleum bertolonii, Daucus carota, Leucanthemum vulgare, Plantago lanceolata, Rumex acetosa and Sanguisorba minor were common. More wildflowers were found on the south-facing plots, such as L. vulgare and P. lanceolata, whereas the grasses L. perenne and C. cristatus preferred the north-facing plots. Frequent cutting increased species richness and diversity, favoured C. cristatus and L. 4 vulgare and reduced L. perenne and P. lanceolata. Grasses such as L. perenne and P. bertolonii were more reduced by compaction than the wildflowers such as Rhinanthus minor and Trifolium pratense. Plots sown with a mixture of grasses and wildflowers had greater above-ground biomass than the grasses-only plots and on the north-facing aspect had greater biomass than the flat and south-facing plots. Plots just sown with grasses had higher biomass on the flat plots. R. minor did not germinate well in the plots with high biomass but survived in regularly cut plots. Plant roots in the Mesocosms grew down the whole soil profile in all treatments (40 cm). The total root mass was greater in the grasses-only plots in comparison to the grass and wildflower plots. However, the grass roots were smaller and finer, whereas the wildflower roots were bigger, yet lighter. Although the grasses-only plots had greater root mass, these plots had lower aboveground biomass, while the grass and wildflower plots had lower root mass, but greater aboveground biomass. Bulk density (BD) and Penetrometer resistance (CI) was greater in the compacted treatment, although this did not reduce root mass, or reduce aboveground biomass. However, CI was greatest in the flat and south-facing plots where root mass was less, and CI was lower in the north-facing plots where root mass was greater. The roadside survey showed that natural colonisation could produce species-rich habitats over time with 116 species found. Arrhenatherum elatius was the commonest grass, Cirsium arvense and Senecio jacobaea were frequent and scrub encroachment was widespread. These roadside verges were not cut frequently enough to prevent succession into scrub and woodland. Centaurea nigra, L. vulgare and D. carota had higher cover on south-facing slopes, contributing to the higher diversity on this aspect. Signs of bareground and desiccation were greater on south-facing slopes. Grasses were more abundant on the north-facing slopes leading to mesotrophic communities on this aspect. Many sites had a unique and unusual combination of species that didn’t fit into the National Vegetation Classification (NVC). Roadside embankment construction does not hinder the establishment of a species-rich seed mixture, although a regular cutting regime is required of {{at least once a year}} to prevent scrub encroachment and to reduce the spread of injurious weeds. A grass and wildflower seed mixture containing a range of functional types will have greater aboveground biomass, with a denser canopy and heterogeneous root system, which will help to prevent surface erosion and runoff and increase soil strength.

30|$|Season of {{fire on the}} DRY plots {{may have}} been {{influenced}} by continuity of fuels and proximity to the Sacramento Valley, as well as the burning practices of the Nomlaki in the woodlands and grasslands. A common practice in these environments in California was to burn <b>grasslands</b> after <b>seeds</b> were collected, which normally took place in the summer (Lewis 1993, Stewart 2002, Anderson 2005). It is likely that the grasses would grow and set seed earlier in the year in the warmer, drier, lower elevations of the Sacramento Valley compared to our sample plots, as the perennial grasses of the time appear to have followed similar patterns of growth and drying as do the annuals of today (Biswell 1956). Thus, fires that spread from the grasslands into our DRY plots could then potentially be represented as growing season scars. Earlywood scars would likely have been most frequent in dry years, which also would potentially contribute to early seed set in grasses. This is similar to the finding of Norman and Taylor (2003) in northeastern California where early season fire scars were associated with unusually dry years.|$|R
