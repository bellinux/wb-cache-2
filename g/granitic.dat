5|$|Seychellum alluaudi is {{endemic to}} the <b>granitic</b> high {{islands in the}} inner group of the Seychelles, in the western Indian Ocean. It is found on the four largest <b>granitic</b> islands – Mahé, La Digue, Silhouette and Praslin – and lives in {{mountain}} streams that flow through rainforest.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} landforms in the Yosemite {{area are}} cut from the <b>granitic</b> rock of the Sierra Nevada Batholith (a {{batholith}} is a large mass of intrusive igneous rock that formed deep below the surface). About 5% of the park's landforms (mostly in its eastern margin near Mount Dana) are metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks. These rocks are called roof pendants because they were once {{the roof of the}} underlying <b>granitic</b> rock.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{categories}} of thorium minerals for thorium extraction: primary and secondary. Primary deposits occur in acidic <b>granitic</b> magmas and pegmatites. They are concentrated, but of small size. Secondary deposits occur at the mouths of rivers in <b>granitic</b> mountain regions. In these deposits, thorium is enriched along with other heavy minerals. Initial concentration varies {{with the type of}} deposit.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah {{has a very}} {{localised}} distribution, being {{restricted to}} Mount Kinabalu and neighbouring Mount Tambuyukon, both located in Kinabalu National Park, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Mount Kinabalu is a massive <b>granitic</b> dome structure that is geologically young and formed from the intrusion and uplift of a <b>granitic</b> batholith. At 4095.2m, it {{is by far the}} tallest mountain on the island of Borneo and one of the highest peaks in Southeast Asia. The lower slopes of the mountain are mainly composed of sandstone and shale, transformed from marine sand and mud about 35 million years ago. Intrusive ultramafic (serpentine) rock was uplifted with the core of the batholith and forms a collar around the mountain. It is on these ultramafic soils that the flora of Mount Kinabalu exhibits the greatest levels of endemicity and many of the area's rarest species can be found here.|$|E
5|$|Seychellum alluaudi is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} crab endemic to the Seychelles, and the only true freshwater crab in that country. It lives in rainforest streams on the archipelago's <b>granitic</b> high islands. Although it may be abundant, {{little is known about}} its biology. If its habitat were to decline in quality, S.alluaudi might become endangered, but it is currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The Wabigoon subprovince is a {{formerly}} active volcanic island chain, {{made up of}} metavolcanic-metasedimentary intrusions. These metamorphosed {{rocks are}} volcanically derived greenstone belts, and are surrounded and cut by <b>granitic</b> plutons and batholiths. The subprovince's greenstone belts consist of felsic volcanics, felsic batholiths and felsic plutons aged from 3,000 to 2,670 million years old.|$|E
5|$|The Wawa subprovince is a {{formerly}} active volcanic island chain, {{consisting of}} metamorphosed greenstone belts which {{are surrounded by}} and cut by <b>granitic</b> plutons and batholiths. These greenstone belts consist of felsic volcanics, felsic batholiths, felsic plutons and sediments aged from 2,700 to 2,670 million years old.|$|E
5|$|The {{uplifting}} {{and increased}} erosion exposed <b>granitic</b> {{rocks in the}} area to surface pressures, resulting in exfoliation (responsible for the rounded shape of the many domes in the park) and mass wasting following the numerous fracture joint planes (cracks; especially vertical ones) in the now solidified plutons. Pleistocene glaciers further accelerated this process and the larger ones transported the resulting talus and till from valley floors.|$|E
5|$|Based on outcrop analysis, the {{crystalline}} basement composed of <b>granitic</b> and monzonitic rocks, {{dates to the}} Cretaceous, the oldest dated sample being 91.2 ± 2 million years old. This rock, a granite, {{may be part of}} a plutonic basement. Younger basement rocks comprise Miocene marine sediments and volcanics pertaining to the Comondú Group. Andesite of Sierra Santa Lucía is found west-southwest of the Santa Rosalía Basin. The basaltic La Esperanza formation is also in the area.|$|E
5|$|Basement rock {{under the}} Mono–Inyo chain {{consists}} of the same <b>granitic</b> and metamorphic rock {{that make up the}} Sierra Nevada. Above that layer are basaltic grading to rhyolitic volcanic rocks that are 3.5 million to less than 760,000 years old. Volcanism occurred north of the chain, in the Bodie Hills, as far back as 28 million years. Nearly all the rock east of the Sierra Nevada in the Mono Basin area is volcanic in origin.|$|E
5|$|Compressive forces {{built up}} along {{the entire length of}} the broad {{continental}} shelf. The Sierran Arc, also called the Cordilleran Mesozoic magmatic arc, started to form from heat and pressure generated from the subduction. Compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop and <b>granitic</b> blobs of magma called plutons to rise in the Death Valley region and beyond, most notably creating the Sierra Nevada Batholith to the west. Thrust faulting was so severe that the continental shelf was shortened and some parts of older formations were moved on top of younger rock units.|$|E
5|$|Estimates for the Earth's crustal content {{range from}} 20 to 70 ppm by weight. In keeping with its name, lithium forms a minor part of igneous rocks, {{with the largest}} {{concentrations}} in granites. <b>Granitic</b> pegmatites also provide the greatest abundance of lithium-containing minerals, with spodumene and petalite being the most commercially viable sources. Another significant mineral of lithium is lepidolite. A newer source for lithium is hectorite clay, the only active development of which is through the Western Lithium Corporation in the United States. At 20mg lithium per kg of Earth's crust, lithium is the 25th most abundant element.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, {{the ground}} of Queen Maud Land is {{dominated}} by Precambrian gneiss, formed c.1 to 1.2Ga, before {{the creation of the}} supercontinent Gondwana. The mountains consist mostly of crystalline and <b>granitic</b> rocks, formed c.500 to 600Ma in the Pan-African orogeny during the assembly of Gondwana. In the farthest western parts of the territory, there are younger sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Research on the thickness of the ice has revealed that without the ice, the coast would be similar to those of Norway and Greenland, with deep fjords and islands.|$|E
5|$|Metagreywackes and metapelites {{from two}} areas {{traversing}} {{one of these}} aureoles near Yellowknife have been studied. Most of the Slave province rocks are <b>granitic</b> with metamorphosed Yellowknife metasedimentary and volcanic rocks. Isotopic ages of these rocks is around , {{the time of the}} Kenoran orogeny. Rocks comprising the Slave province represent a high grade of metamorphism, intrusion and basement remobilization typical of Archean terranes. Migmatites, batholithic intrusive and granulitic metamorphic rocks show foliation and compositional banding; the rocks are uniformly hard and so thoroughly deformed that little foliation exists. Most Yellowknife Supergroup metasediments are tightly folded (isoclinal) or occur in plunging anticlines.|$|E
5|$|The Algoman orogeny {{occurred}} 2800 to , and {{it marks}} {{the end of}} the crust-building Archean Eon. There were several episodes of continental collision, compression and subduction which resulted in mountain building during this time. Orogenic events are characterized by extensive metaphorism, <b>granitic</b> extrusions and unconformities. The Algoman orogeny added landmass along a border from South Dakota to the Lake Huron region; this boundary is the Great Lakes tectonic zone (GLTZ).|$|E
5|$|The NCVP is {{underlain}} by {{four large}} crustal fragments, namely Stikinia, Yukon-Tanana, Cassiar and Cache Creek. Stikinia comprises volcanic, plutonic and sedimentary rocks that {{were created in}} an island arc environment during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. Mélange and abyssal peridotites, formed largely in an ancient oceanic basin, are the primary rocks of the Cache Creek Terrane. These are also Paleozoic to Mesozoic in age and are intersected by younger <b>granitic</b> intrusions. Yukon-Tanana and Cassiar consist of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks derived from the North American continent. The rocks of these two terranes are displaced and autochthonous in nature.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountains}} {{are characteristic of}} the Great Basin's topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys. Oriented generally north to south, the Trout Creek Mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt, which came from an ancient volcano and other vents, on top of older metamorphic rocks. The {{southern end of the}} range, however, features many <b>granitic</b> outcrops. As a whole, the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by escarpments and canyons.|$|E
5|$|Cerro Blanco {{is part of}} the Central Volcanic Zone and {{is located}} at the {{southern}} limit of the Puna. It forms a volcanic unit together with the Aguada Alumbrera ignimbrite, at {{the eastern edge of the}} Cordillera de San Buenaventura. Rocks beneath this unit include dacitic–trachyandesitic volcanites 9–7 mya old and an igneous-metamorphic <b>granitic</b> basement containing orthogneiss, quartz of Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic age, containing paleozoic mafic to ultramafic volcanic inclusions. The Cordillera de San Buenaventura is formed from lava domes and volcanic complexes of intermediary composition of Upper Miocene–Quaternary age. During the Miocene-Pleistocene, the isotope and chemical composition of areal magmas has moved away from arc like magmas to distinctly water-poor and unoxidized petrologies. This finding is consistent with a hot mantle forming after delamination of the crust and migration of the arc.|$|E
5|$|Karnataka {{consists}} of four main types of geological formations— the Archean complex made up of Dharwad schists and <b>granitic</b> gneisses, the Proterozoic non-fossiliferous sedimentary formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series, the Deccan trappean and intertrappean deposits and the tertiary and recent laterites and alluvial deposits. Significantly, about 60% {{of the state is}} composed of the Archean complex which consist of gneisses, granites and charnockite rocks. Laterite cappings that are found in many districts over the Deccan Traps were formed after the cessation of volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil orders are found in Karnataka, viz. Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Spodosols, Alfisols, Ultisols, Oxisols, Aridisols, Vertisols, Andisols and Histosols. Depending on the agricultural capability of the soil, the soil types are divided into six types, viz. red, lateritic, black, alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{interior}} of the northern half of the island is taken up by a large granite batholith that was created by substantial magmatic activity around 58 million years ago in the Paleogene period. This comprises an outer ring of coarse granite and an inner core of finer grained granite, which was intruded later. This granite was intruded into the Late Proterozoic to Cambrian metasediments of the Dalradian Supergroup. Other Paleogene igneous rocks on Arran include extensive felsic and composite sills in the south of the island, and the central ring complex, an eroded caldera system surrounded by a near-continuous ring of <b>granitic</b> rocks.|$|E
5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is {{responsible}} for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on <b>granitic</b> rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the volcanoes' magma has changed significantly with time as they grow over the hotspot and migrate away. Volcanic activity 14.5to 3.0million years ago was predominately felsic, producing large volumes of rhyolite and trachyte lava. This {{can be explained by}} the presence of thick <b>granitic</b> structures under these volcanoes, which have been tectonically compressed from being near the North American Plate margin. A unique characteristic of the felsic lava flows is that although they were high in silica content, the flows were overly fluid in nature. This is because the peralkaline content of these felsic lavas decreased the viscosity of the flows a minimum of 10–30times over that of calc-alkaline felsic flows. Evidence for explosive volcanism exists in the form of pumice flows, bedded tuffs, intensely shattered basement rocks and the high content of coarse basement clasts in rhyolite breccias.|$|E
5|$|The <b>granitic</b> gneiss rocks {{throughout}} the entire coastline are home to large populations of invertebrates, fish and seaweed. These gneiss and the dunes form rich ecosystems, but are threatened by waterfront construction, holiday-makers and dune sports. Short-beaked common dolphins occur in large numbers in Northern Portugal. Dolphins show themselves by porpoising and bowriding along with boats just off the city of Póvoa de Varzim, where fishing activities occur. Alive or dead discarded fish while fishing can be easily caught by dolphins, which could help explain this relationship in the city's waters. Stranded whales and dolphins and found dead occur with some frequency, natural causes, rough seas events, incidents with ships or fishing boats can explain these events.|$|E
5|$|The plutons in {{the park}} are Jurassic and Cretaceous aged and are located toward the park's western margin {{where they can be}} seen from {{unimproved}} roads. One of these relatively small <b>granitic</b> plutons was emplaced 6787 Ma and spawned one of the more profitable precious metal deposits in the Death Valley area, giving rise to the town and mines of Skidoo. In the Death Valley area these solidified blobs of magma are located under much of the Owlshead Mountains and are found in the western end of the Panamint Mountains. Thrusted areas can be seen at Schwaub Peak {{in the southern part of}} the Funeral Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{section of}} the forest in the Wind River Range is the primary destination for mountain climbers. Nine of the highest 10 peaks in Wyoming are here, and the mountains are primarily of <b>granitic</b> rock with countless cliffs and sheer rock walls. The Cirque of the Towers is particularly popular as it has numerous peaks within a relatively short distance of each other. Two particular climbs on the peaks in the cirque are considered amongst the finest climbing adventures available in the U.S. The Absaroka Range also attracts climbers but not of a technical nature since the rocks are not considered solid enough for good anchoring points. For the tallest peaks in the Wind River Range, the entire summiting effort will take even experienced climbers many days due to the inaccessibility {{of the region and}} complexity of the climbing effort.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the oldest}} rocks in Oregon, {{some of the}} {{formations}} in these terranes date to the Triassic, nearly 250million years ago. Between 165 and 170million years ago, in the Jurassic, faulting consolidated the Klamath terranes offshore during what geologists call the Siskiyou orogeny. This three- to five-million-year episode of intense tectonic activity pushed sedimentary rocks deep enough into the mantle to melt them and then forced them to the surface as <b>granitic</b> plutons. Belts of plutons, which contain gold and other precious metals, run through the Klamaths and include the Ashland pluton, the Grayback batholith east of Oregon Caves National Monument, the Grants Pass pluton, the Gold Hill pluton, the Jacksonville pluton, and others. Miners have worked rich deposits of gold, silver, copper, nickel, and other metals in several districts of the Klamaths. Placer mining in the mid-19thcentury soon led to lode mining for gold. Aside from a mine in eastern Oregon, the Greenback Mine along Grave Creek, a Rogue tributary, was the most productive gold mine in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{has some}} of the most ancient rocks found in any U.S. National Park. The oldest rocks dated so far are 2,680 ± 12million years old, though even older rocks are {{believed}} to exist in the park. Formed during the Archean Eon (4 to 2.5billion years ago), these metamorphic rocks include gneiss, schist and amphibolites. Metamorphic rocks are the most common types found in the northern and southern sections of the Teton Range. 2,545million years ago, the metamorphic rocks were intruded by igneous <b>granitic</b> rocks, which are now visible in the central Tetons including Grand Teton and the nearby peaks. The light colored granites of the central Teton Range contrast with the darker metamorphic gneiss found on the flanks of Mount Moran to the north. Magma intrusions of diabase rocks 765million years ago left dikes that can be seen on the east face of Mount Moran and Middle Teton. Granite and pegmatite intrusions also worked their way into fissures in the older gneiss. Precambrian rocks in Jackson Hole are buried deep under comparatively recent Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary deposits, as well as Pleistocene glacial deposits.|$|E
5|$|Level Mountain basalt and {{andesite}} flows {{were presented}} in the 1926 Canada Department of Mines Summary Report, 1925, Part A. The andesites were described as porphyritic rocks with phenocrysts of feldspar of various size in a greyish or greenish matrix. Both hornblende and augite andesites were noted to have been represented under a microscope. The basalts were described as black rocks with basic plagioclase with or without olivine and were noted in many cases to contain a considerable percentage of brownish glass. Although there was not sufficient time available to study these flows in detail it was revealed at several points that the andesites formed the older and the basalts the younger flows. G. M. Dawson of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) was able to demonstrate that on the Stikine River {{there were at least}} four flows of basalt. The basalts and andesites were considered to be younger than all the rocks they were observed in contact with, namely <b>granitic</b> intrusives, porphyries and greenstones. More definite evidence as to their age was obtained by W. A. Johnston and F. A. Kerr of the GSC who placed them in the Tertiary {{with some of the most}} recent flows of the Stikine valley probably belonging to the Pleistocene.|$|E
25|$|The {{remnants}} of the Archean crust in the region can be found within various <b>granitic</b> complexes in the Eastern Pilbara. Xenoliths of 3.58 Ga gabbroic anorthosite were found within the Shaw <b>Granitic</b> Complex. The Warrawagine <b>Granitic</b> Complex contains 3.66–3.58 Ga biotite tonalite gneiss. Presence of 3.8–3.6 Ga detrital zircons also suggests crustal erosion 300 Ma prior to the oldest rocks found.|$|E
25|$|In {{the area}} of Barqueiros, there are {{derivative}} metamorphic rocks (clays, chiastolitic and interspersed schists) which resulted from <b>granitic</b> intrusions in the past. These granites pertain to the larger <b>granitic</b> region, consisting of granite or silicate cliffs with crystals of feldspar of a medium to fine quality.< Sedimentary formations, refer to primarily the modern deposits along {{the margins of the}} Douro, creating terraces, sands and other alluvial deposits.|$|E
25|$|Soils are in {{the valley}} are <b>granitic,</b> poor and well drained with a topsoil of clay, {{providing}} a good substrate for vines.|$|E
25|$|Radon {{exhausts}} naturally {{from the}} ground, particularly in certain regions, especially {{but not only}} regions with <b>granitic</b> soils. Not all <b>granitic</b> regions are prone to high emissions of radon, for instance while the rock which Aberdeen is on is very radium rich the rock lacks the cracks required for the radon to migrate. In other nearby areas of Scotland (to the north of Aberdeen) and in Cornwall/Devon the radon is very much able to leave the rock.|$|E
25|$|On June 25, 2008, Geodex Minerals Ltd., a gold venture firm, {{announced}} {{the results of}} a 2007 - early 2008 diamond drilling program {{on the west side of}} Mount Pleasant. Along with the development of the Sisson Brook tungsten-molybdenum-copper project north of Fredericton, the area surrounding the former Mount Pleasant mine has been a major focus of the company. Research is ongoing, and focuses on the two most likely candidates: the McDougall Brook <b>Granitic</b> suite (MBG) and the Mount Pleasant <b>Granitic</b> suite (MPG).|$|E
25|$|Fourthly, {{where the}} soil is <b>granitic</b> in origin, the heath is {{dominated}} by twiggy daisy-bush with sub-ordinate species such as common correa and shore westringia.|$|E
25|$|The {{freshwater}} crab genus Seychellum is {{endemic to}} the <b>granitic</b> Seychelles, and a further 26 species of crabs and five species of hermit crabs {{live on the}} islands.|$|E
25|$|Quercus agrifolia var. oxyadenia. Southwesternmost California (San Diego area), Baja California. Leaves {{that are}} {{tomentose}} abaxially, with densely interwoven hairs. It prefers <b>granitic</b> soils; hybrids with Q. kelloggii known.|$|E
