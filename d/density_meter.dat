50|$|A Gravitic <b>density</b> <b>meter</b> {{is a type}} of <b>density</b> <b>meter</b> used in {{multiple}} industries to measure the density of a slurry flowing through a pipe line. It consists of a flexible rubber hose that deflects when weight is flowing through the hose. A displacement measurement device, usually a high precision laser or load cell, is used to measure how much change has occurred in the system. By calculating the change of deflection of the hose, a gravitic <b>density</b> <b>meter</b> can be used to find the real time, continuous density.|$|E

5000|$|When a sugar {{solution}} {{is measured by}} refractometer or <b>density</b> <b>meter,</b> the °Bx or °P value obtained by entry into the appropriate table only represents the amount of dry solids dissolved in the sample if the dry solids are exclusively sucrose. This is seldom the case. Grape juice (must), for example, contains little sucrose but does contain glucose, fructose, acids and other substances. In such cases, the °Bx value clearly cannot be equated with the sucrose content, but it may represent a good approximation to the total sugar content. For example, an 11.0% by mass D-Glucose ("grape sugar") solution measured 10.9 °Bx using a hand held instrument. For these reasons, the sugar content of a solution obtained by use of refractometry with the ICUMSA table is often reported as [...] "Refractometric Dry Substance" [...] (RDS) which could {{be thought of as}} an equivalent sucrose content. Where it is desirable to know the actual dry solids content, empirical correction formulas can be developed based on calibrations with solutions similar to those being tested. For example, in sugar refining, dissolved solids can be accurately estimated from refractive index measurement corrected by an optical rotation (polarization) measurement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the problem of {{choosing}} vibration mode of the cylinder shell resonating <b>density</b> <b>meter,</b> this paper analysis the dynamics of the resonator by ANSYS. The modal analysis result shows that the transverse n= 2 and n= 3 all meet the requirement, the fluid-structure interaction result shows that the transverse n= 2 is more sensitive to the changing of fuel density than n= 3. Final analysis of the influence by temperature and pressure on the vibration frequency shows that the influence by pressure is very little which can be omitted, but the influence by temperature is remarkable and needs to be compensated. The conclusions and methods of finite element analysis can be used for resonant liquid <b>density</b> <b>meter</b> design...|$|E
