5|$|Anions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of the Black Creek {{drainage}} basin include sulfate and bicarbonate. The concentrations of aluminum {{in the mine}} pools {{in the area are}} typically very low or nonexistent. However, some mine waters in the watershed can have aluminum ion concentrations of over 70 milligrams per liter, forming 6 percent of total dissolved solids in the water, as measured by weight. The concentration of manganese ions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> can be over 100 milligrams per liter and calcium also occurs in groundwater in the watershed. Magnesium occurs in the non-polluted groundwater in the watershed in concentrations of 1 to 5 milligrams per liter and occurs in polluted groundwater at concentrations of 4 to 440 milligrams per liter.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{compared}} {{the effect on}} weight loss of either replacing diet beverages (DBs) with water or continuing to consume DBs (study 1 in healthy overweight and obese, n= 89 and study 2 in patients with type 2 diabetes, n= 81) adults during a 24 -wk weight-loss program (for study 1 and 2) and 18 month weight loss and weight maintenance plan (for study 3, n= 89). In study 1, compared with the DB group, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group had a greater decrease in weight (1. 2 kg more weight loss <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared with the DBs Group,P= 0. 015), BMI (0. 5 kg/m² more BMI reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> compared with <b>the</b> DBs Group,P= 0. 002), fasting insulin (1 mU/l more Fasting insulin reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> compared with <b>the</b> DBs Group,P< 0. 001), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (0. 2 more HOMA-IR reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> compared with <b>the</b> DBs Group, P< 0. 001) and 2 -h postprandial glucose(0. 305 mmol/l more 2 hpp reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> compared with <b>the</b> DBs Group,P< 0. 001). In study 2, weight (2. 5 kg more weight loss <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> compared with <b>the</b> DBs Group, P= 0. 005) and BMI (0. 9 kg/m² more BMI reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared with the DBs Group, P= 0. 005) decrease after 18 months <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared with the DBs group was significant. There was also a greater reduction in fasting insulin levels (1. 8 mU/l more Fasting insulin reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared with the DBs Group,P< 0. 001), better improvement in HOMA-IR (0. 5 more HOMA-IR reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared with the DBs Group, P< 0. 001), a greater decrease in 2 -h postprandial plasma glucose (0. 5 mmol/l more 2 hpp reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared with the DBs Group, P< 0. 001) and glycated hemoglobin (0. 2 more HbA 1 c reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared with the DBs Group, P= 0. 030) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared with the DBs over 18 months. In study 3, obese participants with Type 2 diabetes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group of study 2 had more weight loss (1. 16 kg more weight loss <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared with the DBs Group, P= 0. 006) and BMI (0. 5 kg/m² more BMI reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared with the DBs Group, P= 0. 006). Also reduction of fasting insulin (1. 6 mU/l more Fasting insulin reduction in water group compared with DBs Group,P< 0. 001), fasting plasma glucose (0. 3 mmol/l more Fasting plasma glucose reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared with the DBs Group, P= 0. 003), HOMA-IR (0. 7 more HOMA-IR reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared with the DBs Group, P= 0. 003) and 2 hour postprandial glucose (0. 3 mmol/l more 2 hpp reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared with the DBs Group, P= 0. 027) was greater <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group. By contrast, changes in waist circumference and lipid profiles {{were not significantly different}} between <b>the</b> two groups <b>in</b> these three studies. Replacement of DBs with <b>water</b> after <b>the</b> main meal <b>in</b> obese and overweight healthy and type 2 diabetic women who were regular users of DBs may cause greater weight reduction during 24 weeks and also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> longer period of an 18 month weight management program. In addition, replacement of DBs with water offers clinical benefits to improve insulin resistance. Generally, better improvements in energy and carbohydrate metabolism may occur when water rather than DBs is consumed over a weight loss program...|$|R
