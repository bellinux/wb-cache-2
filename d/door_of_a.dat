5|$|The {{officers}} of the Lodge are elected or appointed annually. Every Masonic Lodge has a Master, two Wardens, a secretary and a treasurer. There is also a Tyler, or outer guard, who is always present outside the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> working Lodge. Other offices vary between jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in {{the casual}} wards were worse {{than in the}} {{relieving}} rooms and deliberately designed to discourage vagrants, who were considered potential trouble-makers and probably disease-ridden. Vagrants who presented themselves at the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> workhouse were {{at the mercy of}} the porter, whose decision it was whether or not to allocate them a bed for the night in the casual ward. Those refused entry risked being sentenced to two weeks of hard labour if they were found begging or sleeping in the open and prosecuted for an offence under the Vagrancy Act 1824.|$|E
5|$|Laura {{makes the}} orphanage look {{as it did}} thirty years ago and {{attempts}} to contact the children's spirits by playing one of their old games. The spirits lead her to the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hidden underground room. Inside is Simón's corpse, wearing Tomás's mask. Laura finally realizes what happened: while searching for Simón the night he disappeared, Laura moved pieces of construction scaffolding, blocking {{the entrance to the}} secret room. The crashes that night were caused by Simón trying to get out. He fell and broke his neck.|$|E

5|$|The Playford family {{heritage}} can {{be traced}} back to 1759, when a baby boy was left at the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> house in Barnby Dun, Yorkshire, England, with a note to christen the child 'Thomas Playford'. The occupants of the house, who were to raise the child, were given instructions to receive money from a bank account for the deed. The child grew up to be a simple farmer in the village, and had a son in 1795 who he christened 'Thomas Playford'. The tradition of naming the firstborn son in the family in this way has continued since.|$|E
5|$|The gunfight {{was not the}} end of the conflict. On December 28, 1881, Virgil Earp was ambushed and maimed in {{a murder}} attempt by the Cowboys. On March 18, 1882, Cowboys fired from a dark alley through the glass <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> saloon, killing Morgan Earp. The {{suspects}} in both incidents furnished alibis supplied by other Cowboys and were not indicted. Wyatt Earp, newly appointed as Deputy U.S. Marshal in Cochise County, then took matters into his own hands in a personal vendetta. He was pursued by county sheriff Johnny Behan, who had received a warrant from Tucson for Wyatt's shooting of Frank Stilwell.|$|E
5|$|The next night, the ghouls {{leave the}} belfry and float into town {{accompanied}} by their straitjacketed, deformed minions. They {{knock on the}} <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> student. When he opens it, aroused from sleeping, they hold him down and carve out his heart while he tries in vain to scream. At Giles' apartment his visiting girlfriend, Olivia, is frightened by one of The Gentlemen outside Giles' window. The following morning in a campus classroom, Giles uses a series of overhead transparencies {{to explain to the}} others that The Gentlemen steal the townspeople's voices so no one can scream as they gather the hearts they need, and that folklore indicates that they have been vanquished before when a princess screamed: the only thing that will kill them is a live human voice.|$|E

25|$|His inheritance, {{multiplied by}} the {{favorable}} exchange rate the American dollar enjoyed in postwar Europe, allowed them to indulge in an extravagant expatriate lifestyle. Crosby's trust fund provided them with US$12,000 a year (or $ in today's dollars). Still, Crosby repeatedly overdrew his account at State Street Trust in Boston and at Morgan, Harjes, in Paris, which in blue-blood Boston was like writing graffiti on the front <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> church.|$|E
25|$|In July 1943, the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was {{dispatched}} to England and {{came under the}} command of the 3rd Parachute Brigade of the British 6th Airborne Division. The Battalion then spent the next year in training for airborne operations. Major differences between their previous American training and the new regime included jumping with only one parachute, and doing it {{through a hole in the}} floor of the aircraft, instead of through the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> C-47 Dakota.|$|E
25|$|According to some reports, Gelman started {{banging on}} the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> motorman's cab, {{demanding}} to be let in, at which point two police officers assigned to the manhunt arrived and subdued him after a struggle with Lozito's help. However, other accounts stated that Lozito engaged in a physical confrontation that subdued Gelman, while officers Terrance Howell and Tamara Taylor hid in the motorman's cab, and did not come out until Lozito had disarmed Gelman and pinned him on the ground.|$|E

25|$|As the killer's epithet implies, {{the victims}} usually were {{attacked}} with an axe, which often {{belonged to the}} victims themselves. In most cases, a panel on a back <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> home was removed by a chisel, which were both left on the floor near the door, followed by an attack on {{one or more of}} the residents with either an axe or straight razor. The crimes were not motivated by robbery, and the perpetrator never removed items from his victims' homes.|$|E
25|$|The traps of the bladderworts {{may have}} derived from {{pitchers}} that specialized in aquatic prey when flooded, like Sarracenia psittacina does today. Escaping prey in terrestrial pitchers {{have to climb}} or fly out of a trap, and both of these can be prevented by wax, gravity and narrow tubes. However, a flooded trap can be swum out of, so in Utricularia, a one-way lid may have developed to form the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> proto-bladder. Later, this may have become active by {{the evolution of a}} partial vacuum inside the bladder, tripped by prey brushing against trigger hairs {{on the door of the}} bladder.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the raid, the room was poorly illuminated. Sergeant Pat Gonzales entered the room first, {{followed}} by Sergeant Ervin Romans. As Romans entered, he was ambushed by Mixon, who shot him through the wall and <b>door</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bedroom he was hiding in, mortally wounding him. Gonzales was then shot and wounded in the shoulder, although he continued to lead the team inside the bedroom. None of the officers had yet managed to fire their weapons due to the poor lighting of the room. They were momentarily surprised by a woman who screamed loudly and fled from the bathroom.|$|E
