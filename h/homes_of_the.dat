5|$|Founded in 1844, Willamette University's {{library was}} started {{two years after}} the {{establishment}} of the school. The library grew to a size of 2,500 volumes in 1874.

5|$|Pipe {{organs are}} {{installed}} in churches, synagogues, concert halls, schools, other public buildings and in private properties.

5|$|Converting to evangelical Christianity in the 1880s, Sunday left {{baseball}} for the Christian ministry. He gradually developed his {{skills as a}} pulpit evangelist in the Midwest and then, during the early 20th century, he became the nation's most famous evangelist with his colloquial sermons and frenetic delivery. Sunday held widely reported campaigns in America's largest cities, and he attracted the largest crowds of any evangelist {{before the advent of}} electronic sound systems. He also made {{a great deal of money}} and was welcomed into the <b>homes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wealthy and influential. Sunday was a strong supporter of Prohibition, and his preaching likely played a significant role in the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919.|$|E

5|$|Vernacular {{architecture}} {{of this period}} continued to dependent on local materials and styles. Often built by groups of friends and family, the <b>homes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rural poor were usually of very simple construction. Contemporaries noted that cottages in the Highlands and Islands tended to be cruder, with single rooms, slit windows and earthen floors, often shared by a large family. In contrast many Lowland cottages had distinct rooms and chambers, were clad with plaster or paint and even had glazed windows. In the early 1800s urban settings also included traditional thatched houses, beside the larger, stone and slate roofed town houses of merchants and urban gentry.|$|E
5|$|While {{urban centres}} were rebuilt in local materials, {{including}} Aberdeen in granite and Glasgow in red sandstone, the <b>homes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rural poor remained basic, {{particularly in the}} Highlands. In the cities they were confined to the sprawl of suburban tenements {{like those of the}} Gorbals in Glasgow. One response to growing population was the creation of planned new towns, like those at Inverary and New Lanark. The nineteenth century also was the revival of the Scots Baronial style, pioneered at Walter Scott's Abbotsford House and confirmed in popularity by Queen Victoria's residence at Balmoral Castle. There was also a revival of Gothic styles in church architecture. Neo-classicism continued to be a major movement in the works of architects including William Henry Playfair and Alexander 'Greek' Thomson. The later part of the century also saw {{some of the most important}} architectural products of new engineering, including the iconic Forth Bridge.|$|E
5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{a disastrous}} factor for domestic psychiatry {{is that those}} who had committed the crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way. Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public {{has been reduced to}} making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of the <b>homes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not up to it, the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the three}} {{compounds}} built within the rova by successive Merina rulers bears distinct architectural styles that reflect the dramatic changes experienced in Imerina over {{the reign of the}} 19th century Kingdom of Madagascar, which saw the arrival and rapid expansion of European influence at the royal court. The site contains a blend of traditional Merina and European styles and construction methods. The predominant architectural features and layout of the royal city follow the traditional model of rova construction that predominated in the Highlands from the 15th century. Following tradition, the <b>homes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living are constructed of wood and vegetation (living materials), while the tombs of the dead are built in stone (cold, inert material). The selection of specific wood and plant materials used in construction, each of which were imbued with distinct symbolic meaning, reflected traditional social norms and spiritual beliefs. Since 1996, many of the buildings have undergone restoration using traditional materials and construction practices appropriate to the era in which the buildings were first erected.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{went through}} periods of {{enlargement}} and renovation following {{the fires of}} 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to {{the northern and southern}} walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapterhouse dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The <b>homes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in the chanonry and were destroyed by fire on three occasions: in 1270, 1390 and 1402. The two towers of the west front are mostly complete and were part of the first phase of construction. Only the precentor's manse is substantially intact; two others have been incorporated into private buildings. A protective wall of massive proportions surrounded the cathedral precinct, but only a small section has survived. The wall had four access gates, one of which—the Pans Port—still exists.|$|E
5|$|The vernacular {{architecture}} of Scotland, as elsewhere, {{made use of}} local materials and methods. The <b>homes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor were usually of very simple construction, and were built by groups of family and friends. Stone is plentiful throughout Scotland and was a common building material, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. As in English {{vernacular architecture}}, where wood was available, crucks (pairs of curved timbers) were often used to support the roof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the crucks were sometimes raised and supported on the walls. Walls were often built of stone, and could have gaps filled with turf, or plastered with clay. In some regions wattled walls filled in with turf were employed, sometimes on a stone base. Turf-filled walls were not long-lasting, {{and had to be}} rebuilt perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. Different regions used turfs, or thatch of broom, heather, straw or reeds for roofing.|$|E
