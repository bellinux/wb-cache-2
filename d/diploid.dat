If there are n <b>diploids</b> at time 0, then at a time x in the past, there will have been about ne (µ−λ) x <b>diploids.</b> The rate of hybridization at time 0 is βλ multiplied by the number of pairs of <b>diploids</b> whose mrca is after t, and is therefore the number of pairs within the approximately ne (λ−µ) t subtrees which have grown from the <b>diploids</b> that were present at time t.

40|$|Two loci (the {{incompatibility}} or mating type loci), a and b, {{govern the}} life cycle of Ustilago maydis, a fungal pathogen of corn. U. maydis <b>diploids</b> heterozygous at both a and b (a[unk] b[unk]) form mycelial colonies (Fuz+ phenotype), induce tumors, and produce teliospores able to undergo meiosis. We report here the isolation and characterization of nonmycelial (Fuz-) derivatives. These Fuz- <b>diploids</b> have allowed us to examine the requirement of a[unk] and b[unk] in maintenance of filamentous growth and tumor-inducing ability. The Fuz- <b>diploids</b> are of four classes: two are inferred to be homozygous for b (a[unk] b=); the other two are shown to be homozygous for a (a= b[unk]). These observations confirm the requirement for b[unk] and reveal the requirement for a[unk] in filamentous growth. U. maydis is thus like other basidiomycetes that have two loci governing growth of the dikaryotic filament. The mating behavior of the Fuz- <b>diploids</b> indicates that heterozygosity at a or b does not block mating. Although both a= b[unk] and a[unk] b= <b>diploids</b> are nonmycelial, they differ in that a[unk] b= <b>diploids</b> are nonpathogenic, whereas a= b[unk] <b>diploids</b> are pathogenic and produce teliospores able to undergo meiosis. These findings substantiate previous, more limited observations. They demonstrate that ability to induce tumors and produce normal teliospores requires different alleles at b but not at a...|$|R

5|$|Asplenium bradleyi, {{commonly}} known as Bradley's spleenwort or cliff spleenwort, is a rare epipetric fern of east-central North America. Named after Professor Frank Howe Bradley, who first collected it in Tennessee, it may be found infrequently {{throughout much of the}} Appalachian Mountains, the Ozarks, and the Ouachita Mountains, growing in small crevices on exposed sandstone cliffs. The species originated as a hybrid between mountain spleenwort (Asplenium montanum) and ebony spleenwort (Asplenium platyneuron); A.bradleyi originated when that sterile <b>diploid</b> hybrid underwent chromosome doubling to become a fertile tetraploid, a phenomenon known as allopolyploidy. Studies indicate that the present population of Bradley's spleenwort arose from several independent doublings of sterile <b>diploid</b> hybrids. A.bradleyi can also form sterile hybrids with several other spleenworts.|$|E

He produced an artificial autotetraploid grass from the <b>diploid</b> species Ehrharta erecta through treatment with the chromosome doubling agent colchicine. He was able to establish the plant in the field, and after 39 years of field trials was able to show that the autopolyploid was not as successful as its <b>diploid</b> parent in an unchanging environment.|$|E
5|$|In The American Species of Crepis, Babcock and Stebbins {{described}} {{the concept of}} the polyploid complex, and its role in plant evolution. Some genera, such as Crepis, have a complex of reproductive forms that center on sexually <b>diploid</b> populations that have also given rise to polyploid ones. Babcock and Stebbins also observed that allopolyploid types formed from the hybridization of two different species always have a wider distribution than <b>diploid</b> or autotetraploid species, and proposed that polyploids formed through hybridization have a greater potential to exploit varied environments, because they inherit all traits from both parents. They also showed that hybridization in the polyploid complex could provide a mechanism for genetic exchange between <b>diploid</b> species that were otherwise unable to breed. Their observations offered insight into species formation and knowledge of how all these complex processes could provide information on the history of a genus. This monograph was described by Swedish botanist Åke Gustafsson as the most important work on the formation of species during that period.|$|E
40|$|During {{the process}} of sporulation, a/α <b>diploids</b> degrade about 50 % of their {{vegetative}} proteins. This degradation is not sporulation specific, for asporogenous <b>diploids</b> of a/a mating type degrade their vegetative proteins in a fashion {{similar to that of}} their a/α counterparts. <b>Diploids</b> lacking carboxypeptidase Y activity, prc 1 /prc 1, show about 80 % of wild-type levels of protein degradation, but are unimpaired in the production of normal asci. <b>Diploids</b> lacking proteinase B activity, prb 1 /prb 1, show about 50 % of wild-type levels of protein degradation. The effect on degradation of the proteinase B deficiency is epistatic to the degradation deficit attributable to the carboxypeptidase Y deficiency. The prb 1 homozygotes undergo meiosis and produce spores, but the asci and, possibly, the spores are abnormal. <b>Diploids</b> homozygous for the pleiotropic pep 4 – 3 mutation show only 30 % of the wild-type levels of degradation when exposed to a sporulation regimen, and do not undergo meiosis or sporulation. Neither proteinase B nor carboxypeptidase Y is necessary for germination of spores. ——Approximately half of the colonies arising from a/a or α/α <b>diploids</b> exposed to the sporulation regiment that express an initially heterozygous drug-resistance marker (can 1) appear to arise from mating-type switches followed by meiosis and sporulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlterations {{in protein}} {{composition}} or dosage within chromatin may trigger changes in {{processes such as}} gene expression and DNA repair. Through transposon mutagenesis and targeted gene deletions in haploids and <b>diploids</b> of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified mutations that affect telomeric silencing in genes encoding telomere-associated Sir 4 p and Yku 80 p and chromatin remodeling ATPases Ies 2 p and Rsc 1 p. We found that sir 4 /SIR 4 heterozygous <b>diploids</b> efficiently silence the mating type locus HMR but not telomeres, and <b>diploids</b> heterozygous for yku 80 and ies 2 mutations are inefficient at DNA repair. In contrast, strains heterozygous for most chromatin remodeling ATPase mutations retain wild-type silencing and DNA repair levels. Thus, in <b>diploids,</b> chromatin structures required for DNA repair and telomeric silencing are sensitive to dosage changes...|$|R

Based on an extensive review of karyotype studies, the botanist Fernando Rivadavia suggested that the base chromosome number for the genus could be 2n = 20, a number that many Drosera species share including the widespread D.rotundifolia. Exceptions to this base number include the Australian, New Zealand and Southeast Asian Drosera, which have chromosome numbers ranging from 2n = 6 to 64.|$|E
5|$|Like most brown algae, Postelsia {{goes through}} {{alternation}} of generations, {{and is an}} annual species.

These spores develop, through mitosis, into small, multicellular haploid gametophytes, male and female. The male and female gametophytes create sperm and eggs, respectively. The sperm of the male reaches the female egg and fertilizes, resulting in a <b>diploid</b> zygote, which develops into a new sporophyte.|$|E
30|$|Tetraploids can artificially produce {{triploid}} progeny after fertilization through normal <b>diploids</b> (Refstie 1981). Hence, tetraploid breeding {{lines are}} beneficial to aquaculture {{because they provide}} a convenient approach to produce large numbers of sterile triploid fish through simple interploidy crosses between tetraploids and <b>diploids</b> (Chourrout et al. 1986). Successful production of triploids by crossing <b>diploids</b> and tetraploids has only been observed once in fish (Chourrout et al. 1986). Since the 1980 s, the interploidy technique has also been considered an important method for reproductive containment of genetically modified fish through the generation of sterile triploid transgenics using tetraploids and <b>diploids</b> (Nam et al. 2001 a).

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of A.gallica {{includes}} two diploidization–haploidization events.

The second event is more cryptic, and occurs before fruit body formation. In most basidiomycetous fungi, the hyphae of compatible mating types will fuse to form a two-nucleate, or dikaryotic stage; this stage is not observed in Armillaria species, which have cells that are mostly monokaryotic and <b>diploid.</b> Genetic analyses suggest that the dikaryotic mycelia undergo an extra haploidization event prior to fruit body formation to create a genetic mosaic. These regular and repeating haploidization events result in increased genetic diversity, which helps the fungus to adapt to unfavorable changes in environmental conditions, like drought.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Glucose {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an energy source for a long time, but it has recently been suggested that the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and downstream protein O-GlcNAcylation have important functions in mouse preimplantation development. Thus, whether or not O-GlcNAcylation was present and what functions O-GlcNAcylation has in pig preimplantation development were investigated in the present study. The expressions of mRNA of glutamine fructose- 6 -phosphate aminotransferase (Gfpt), O-GlcNAc transferase (Ogt) and O-GlcNAcase (Oga), which {{are involved in the}} HBP and O-GlcNAc cycling, were examined in pig parthenogenetic <b>diploids</b> at each preimplantation developmental stage. Gfpt and Ogt were detected in <b>diploids</b> at all stages. Though Oga was detected at all stages except the 4 -cell stage, OGA proteins were detected in <b>diploids</b> from the 2 -cell to blastocyst stage. Furthermore, O-GlcNAcylated proteins in MII oocytes and <b>diploids</b> were also detected by immunofluorescence at every stage. Inhibition of OGT by 4. 0 mM BADGP did not affect development up to the blastocyst stage, while inhibition of OGA by 300 µM PUGNAc decreased the proportion of <b>diploids</b> beyond the 4 -cell stage. Four-cell <b>diploids</b> cultured with PUGNAc until 48 h developed to the blastocyst stage after culture in a PUGNAc-free medium until 144 h after electrostimulation. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) phosphorylation, which indicates the onset of mRNA transcription, was detected in nuclei of <b>diploids</b> in the control group at 48 h but not in the PUGNAc-treated group. These results indicate that HBP and O-GlcNAcylation have important functions in pig preimplantation development and that inhibition of OGA is fatal for development.
