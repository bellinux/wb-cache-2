60|$|The Spindlewood {{property}} {{had long}} been critically situated. Sundry financial changes which were going, on in the country had depreciated its profits, and affected it unfavorably. All now depended upon the permanency of one commercial house. John had been passing through an interval of great anxiety. He could not tell Lillie his trouble. He had been for months past nervously watching all the <b>in-comings</b> and outgoings of his family, arranged {{on a scale of}} reckless expenditure, which he felt entirely powerless to control. Lillie's wishes were importunate. She was nervous and hysterical, wholly incapable of listening to reason; and the least attempt to bring her to change any of her arrangements, or to restrict any of her pleasures, brought tears and faintings and distresses and scenes of domestic confusion which he shrank from. He often tried to set before her the possibility that they might be obliged, for a time at least, to live in a different manner; but she always resisted every such supposition as so frightful, so dreadful, that he was utterly discouraged, and put off and off, hoping that the evil day never might arrive.|$|R

60|$|The {{consequences}} of this error were of no great importance. The housekeeper merely set herself to watch her master one day earlier than had been calculated on--a result which had been already provided for by the wise precautionary measure of forbidding Noel Vanstone all communication with North Shingles. Doubting, as Captain Wragge had foreseen, the sincerity of her master's desire to break off his connection with the Bygraves by going to St. Crux, Mrs. Lecount tested the truth or falsehood of the impression produced on her own mind by vigilantly watching for sign s of secret communication on one side or on the other. The close attention with which she had hitherto observed the out-goings and <b>in-comings</b> at North Shingles was now entirely transferred to her master. For {{the rest of that}} third day she never let him out of her sight; she never allowed any third person who came to the house, on any pretense whatever, a minute's chance of private communication with him. At intervals through the night she stole to the door of his room, to listen and assure herself that he was in bed; and before sunrise the next morning, the coast-guardsman going his rounds was surprised to see a lady who had risen as early as himself engaged over her work at one of the upper windows of Sea View.|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} {{accounting}} registering based upon historic cost {{is a sure}} and checkable value, written in a document that certifies a property right upon a certain good, a debt right or a debt. Historic costs’ evaluation consists in registering goods <b>in-comings</b> into the company’s patrimony at their buying cost, namely their historic cost, with no further modification although the real value changes. Fair value {{is the foundation of}} IFRS referential which displays basic principles, largely inspired by US GAAP, although they are not mentioned by them. Fair value evaluation is opposed to the principle of prudence, one of the main principles of French accounting law (also taken over by Romanian accounting standards) owing to which only possible losses are registered while potential profits are ignored. The issues that occur refer to the impact of the evaluation according to the fair value upon the accounting data of the company, namely upon the balance sheet and the results account drawn out {{on the basis of the}} fair value registrations. At the same time, the evaluation according to the fair value has determined a new foundation in displaying a company’s performance.

40|$|Unfortunately I, {{like the}} {{majority}} of average westerners, owe money. After a visit to one bank I took a complementary pen. When I got home I began to work out my monthly <b>in-comings</b> and outgoings, rent, travel, food etc [...] . {{with the intention of}} forming some kind of repayment plan. I got frustrated {{and looked down at the}} pen I was writing with; the branded blue pen from the bank. Printed on the spine of the pen was the phrase ‘Borrowed from my bank’. I decided to see how much ‘ink’ I could ‘borrow from my bank’. I started to fill in each square on A 3 graph paper until the ink ran out. I wanted to see if I could fill the page or not. In the same way I try to stretch my wages and manage debt each month. As the project progressed I started to use the ink to depict specific financial data related to particular financial institutions and their/our role in this recession.

2500|$|If one has {{a source}} of heat at {{temperature}} [...] and cooler heat sink at temperature , the maximum theoretically possible value for the ratio of work (or electric power) obtained to heat supplied is , given by a Carnot heat engine. If we take 6000K for {{the temperature of the}} sun and 300K for ambient conditions on earth, this comes to 95%. In 1981, Alexis de Vos and Herman Pauwels showed that this is achievable with a stack of an infinite number of cells with band gaps ranging from infinity (the first cells encountered by the incoming photons) to zero, with a voltage in each cell very close to the open-circuit voltage, equal to 95% of the band gap of that cell, and with 6000K blackbody radiation coming from all directions. However, the 95% efficiency thereby achieved means that the electric power is 95% of the net amount of light absorbed – the stack emits radiation as it has non-zero temperature, and this radiation has to be subtracted from the incoming radiation when calculating the amount of heat being transferred and the efficiency. They also considered the more relevant problem of maximizing the power output for a stack being illuminated from all directions by 6000K blackbody radiation. In this case, the voltages must be lowered to less than 95% of the band gap (the percentage is not constant over all the cells). They found that the maximum power was 86.8% of the amount of <b>in-coming</b> radiation. When the <b>in-coming</b> radiation comes only from an area of the sky the size of the sun, the efficiency limit drops to 68.7%.|$|E

6000|$|Another {{friendly}} pressure, {{and they}} parted. As Morton descended the pier {{to get into}} the boat, a hand placed in his a letter folded up in very small space. He looked round. The person who gave it seemed much muffled up; he pressed his finger upon his lip, and then disappeared among the crowd. The incident awakened Morton's curiosity; and when he found himself on board of a vessel bound for Rotterdam, and saw all his companions of the voyage busy making their own arrangements, he took an opportunity to open the billet thus mysteriously thrust upon him. It ran thus:--"Thy courage on the fatal day when Israel fled before his enemies, hath, in some measure, atoned for thy unhappy owning of the Erastian interest. These are not days for Ephraim to strive with Israel. --I know thy heart is with the daughter of the stranger. But turn from that folly; for in exile, and in flight, and even in death itself, shall my hand be heavy against that bloody and malignant house, and Providence hath given me the means of meting unto them with their own measure of ruin and confiscation. The resistance of their stronghold was the main cause of our being scattered at Bothwell Bridge, and I have bound it upon my soul to visit it upon them. Wherefore, think of her no more, but join with our brethren in banishment, whose hearts are still towards this miserable land to save and to relieve her. There is an honest remnant in Holland whose eyes are looking out for deliverance. Join thyself unto them like the true son of the stout and worthy Silas Morton, and thou wilt have good acceptance among them for his sake and for thine own working. Shouldst thou be found worthy again to labour in the vineyard, thou wilt at all times hear of my <b>in-comings</b> and out-goings, by enquiring after Quintin Mackell of Irongray, at the house of that singular Christian woman, Bessie Maclure, near to the place called the Howff, where Niel Blane entertaineth guests. So much from him who hopes to hear again from thee in brotherhood, resisting unto blood, and striving against sin. Meanwhile, possess thyself in patience. Keep thy sword girded, and thy lamp burning, as one that wakes in the night; for He who shall judge the Mount of Esau, and shall make false professors as straw, and malignants as stubble, will come in the fourth watch with garments dyed in blood, and the house of Jacob shall be for spoil, and the house of Joseph for fire.

All day they sped over the ice and snow in widening circles. When night came, they waited till the moon arose, and then continued the search. It was not till the forenoon of the following day that the unsuccessful searchers began to drop in one by one, worn-out and disheartened.|$|E

6000|$|A {{remarkable}} {{event of}} {{the third year of}} my Surveyorship--to adopt the tone of [...] "P. P. [...] "--was the election of General Taylor to the Presidency. It is essential, in order to form a complete estimate of the advantages of official life, to view the incumbent at the <b>in-coming</b> of a hostile administration. His position is then one of the most singularly irksome, and, in every contingency, disagreeable, that a wretched mortal can possibly occupy; with seldom an alternative of good on either hand, although what presents itself to him as the worst event may very probably be the best. But it is a strange experience, to a man of pride and sensibility, to know that his interests are within the control of individuals who neither love nor understand him, and by whom, since one or the other must needs happen, he would rather be injured than obliged. Strange, too, for one who has kept his calmness throughout the contest, to observe the bloodthirstiness that is developed in the hour of triumph, and to be conscious that he is himself among its objects! There are few uglier traits of human nature than this tendency--which I now witnessed in men no worse than their neighbours--to grow cruel, merely because they possessed the power of inflicting harm. If the guillotine, as applied to office-holders, were a literal fact, instead {{of one of the most}} apt of metaphors, it is my sincere belief that the active members of the victorious party were sufficiently excited to have chopped off all our heads, and have thanked Heaven for the opportunity! It appears to me--who have been a calm and curious observer, as well in victory as defeat--that this fierce and bitter spirit of malice and revenge has never distinguished the many triumphs of my own party as it now did that of the Whigs. The Democrats take the offices, as a general rule, because they need them, and because the practice of many years has made it the law of political warfare, which unless a different system be proclaimed, it was weakness and cowardice to murmur at. But the long habit of victory has made them generous. They know how to spare when they see occasion; and when they strike, the axe may be sharp indeed, but its edge is seldom poisoned with ill-will; nor is it their custom ignominiously to kick the head which they have just struck off.|$|E
