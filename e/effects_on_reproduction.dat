5000|$|Many {{drugs have}} {{effects on the}} human {{reproductive}} system: these may be desired (hormonal contraception), a minor unwanted side effect (many antidepressants) or a major public health problem (thalidomide).

50|$|Non-human {{animal studies}} have shown that {{exposure}} to environmental contaminants with estrogenic activity can accelerate the onset of puberty. A potential mechanism has been described in rats exposed to DDT or beta-estradiol in which GnRH pulsatile secretion was found to be increased. Oral exposure of female rats to xenoestrogens has been shown to cause pseudo precocious puberty (early vaginal opening and early first estrus). A study of dioxin in immature female rats induced early follicular development and phthalates are known to decrease the anogenital distance in newborn rats. Although this article focuses on the effects of xenoestrogens and reproductive function in females, numerous animal studies also implicate environmental estrogens' and androgens' adverse effects on the male reproduction system. Administration of estrogens to developing male animals reduces testicular weight and decreases sperm production. The small phallus size of male alligators has been linked to contamination of their natural Florida habitat with DDT. Data from animal research is abundant demonstrating the adverse <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>reproduction</b> of hormonally active compounds found in the environment.|$|E

30|$|Any {{particular}} pastoral {{system may}} be envisaged {{as a product of}} a number of interacting variables: the characteristics of the animals, the environment, and of the human culture. The physiological and behavioural characteristics of the different domestic animal species and breeds affect their suitability to different climatic, topographical and ecological environments (Kerven et al. 1996; Nardone et al. 2006; Temple 1984). Environmental and biological factors which can affect animal populations, especially through their <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>reproduction</b> and mortality, include: environmental temperature, humidity, daylight length, nutrition, water availability, disease, and heredity (Temple 1984). A better understanding of pastoral economies will stem from a consideration of all aspects influencing these systems (Popova 2006).|$|R

We found that female bluebirds {{were more likely to be}} seropositive than male bluebirds. Age and individual condition did not affect likelihood of being seropositive. Being seropositive for WNV was not associated with any negative <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>reproduction</b> or survival. However, female fecundity was higher in years after WNV compared to years before the arrival of WNV. The reproductive success of males who tested positive for WNV exposure was higher than that of males that were seronegative.

30|$|Environmental hormones, {{also called}} {{environmental}} endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), are mainly produced by various human activities and environment pollution. These hormones have similar structures to natural hormones, {{and they can}} easily interfere with the normal hormone function of human body [1]. Most of them have estrogen effects. Although the environmental concentrations of hormones are very low, their adverse <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>reproduction</b> of organisms is significant. Moreover, they can also cause strong biological effects: reduce the biological immune ability, damage the biological nervous system, and cause {{a serious threat to}} human’s health and safety. Some papers have reported that obesity, juvenile delinquency, attention, and out-of-control emotions, and other abnormal conditions are likely to have a relationship with environmental hormones [2 – 4].|$|R
40|$|Abstract Recent {{research}} on primates and other taxa {{has shown that}} the relationships individuals form with members of the same sex affect their reproductive success. Evidence showing that intersexual relationships also influence repro-duction, however, is more equivocal. Here, we show that male chimpanzees living in an exceptionally large commu-nity display long-term tendencies to associate with particu-lar females. These association patterns are likely to arise because individuals of both sexes selectively range in spe-cific areas of the communal territory, with males inheriting the ranging patterns of their mothers. These differentiated male–female socio-spatial relationships involved males of widely varying ranks, and their <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>reproduction</b> is as strong as that of male dominance rank, which in turn is as strong a predictor of reproductive success at Ngogo as i...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-An {{urgent need}} exists for {{incorporating}} heterocyclic compounds and (bio) transformation products in ecotoxicological test schemes and risk assessment of {{polycyclic aromatic compounds}} (PACs). The aim {{of the present study}} therefore was to determine the chronic effects of (heterocyclic) PACs on two terrestrial invertebrates, the springtail Folsomia candida and the enchytraeid Enchytraeus crypticus. The effects of 11 PACs were determined in chronic experiments using reproduction and survival as endpoints. The results demonstrated that as far as narcosis-induced mortality is concerned, effects of both homocyclic and heterocyclic PACs are well described by the relationship between estimated pore-water 50 % lethal concentrations and log K ow. In contrast, specific <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>reproduction</b> varied between species and between compounds as closely related as isomers, showing up as deviations from the relationship between pore-water 50 % effect concentrations and log K ow. These unpredictable specific <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>reproduction</b> force one to test the toxicity of these PACs to populations of soil invertebrates to obtain reliable effect concentrations for use in risk assessment of PACs...|$|E
