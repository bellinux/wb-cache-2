40|$|Abstract- Piecewise linear branch {{predictor}} {{has been}} demonstrated to have superior prediction accuracy; however, its huge hardware overhead prevents the predictor from being practical in the VLSI design. This paper presents two novel techniques targeting at reducing the hardware cost of the predictor, i. e., history skewed indexing and stack-based misprediction recovery. The former is designed {{to reduce the number}} of ahead-pipelined paths by introducing the history bits in the index of the weight table, while the latter employs stacks instead of arrays of registers to recover predictor states from misprediction. Experimental results show that history skewed indexing helps the predictor improve prediction accuracy by 5. 8 % at the same <b>harware</b> cost. Moreover, the combination of these techniques can achieve about 30 % area reduction with less than 3 % IPC loss compared with the original piecewise linear predictor. I...|$|E

40|$|Standardization {{activity}} of data communication in avionic systems started in 1968 {{for the purpose}} of total system integration and the elimination of heavy wire bundles carrying signals between various subassemblies. The growing complexity of avionic systems is straining the capabilities of MIL-STD- 1553 B (first issued in 1973), but a much greater challenge to it is posed by Ada, the standard language adopted for real-time, computer embedded-systems. Hardware implementation of Ada communication protocols in a contention/token bus or token ring network is proposed. However, during the transition period when the current command/response multiplex data bus is still flourishing and the development environment for distributed multi-computer Ada systems is as yet lacking, a temporary accomodation of the standard language with the standard bus could be very useful and even highly desirable. By concentrating all status informtion and decisions at the bus controller, it was found to be possible to construct an elegant and efficient <b>harware</b> impelementation of the Ada protocols at the bus interface.

The system uses colour ratios to hypothesise the location of beacons and then tests each hypothesis by comparing the image data with the predicted appearance of the beacon.

Experiments show the system to be robust and accurate. 1 Introduction Robot localisation is still a challenging problem: there are many partial solutions, but each has its drawbacks.

40|$|The {{last fifteen}} years has seen a vast {{proliferation}} of middleboxes to solve all manner of persistent limitations in the Internet protocol suite.

However, most smaller networks in homes, small businesses and the developing world are left without this level of support. Further, the management burden and limitations of middleboxes are apparent even in enterprise networks. We argue for a shift from using proprietary middlebox <b>harware</b> as the dominant tool for managing networks toward using open software running on end hosts. We show that functionality that seemingly must be in the network, such as NATs and traffic prioritization, can be more cheaply, flexibly, and securely provided by distributed software running on end hosts, working in concert with vastly simplified physical network hardware. ...|$|E

These processors typically use a few coarse grain threads that can {{be difficult for the}} programmer or compiler to exploit; however, Processing in Memory (PIM) is a technology that has been explored through a long series of supercomputer projects as a facilitator for a different multithreaded execution models. In the multithreading model explored by PIMs, the threads can have radically different characteristics.

The whole project idea is to try to capture basic principles of bio-computing system allowing massive parallelism. The model of computation is based on the concept of selfdeveloping network of compute nodes, the machine is a 2 -D cellular automaton grid whose evolution rule is fixed and implemented by simplified physical laws. A machine configuration represents idealized physical objects such as membrane or particle gas. A central object called blob is the <b>harware</b> image of a compute node. Based on published formal proof, this paper presents first an implementation of the blob object using the “programmable matter ” platform of Cellular Automaton simulation. Then it describes an implementation of Blob division, the machine implementation of compute node duplication. We used five different kinds of cellular automaton rules, all explained in separate boxes. The result obtained can be classified as a new specific form of self-reproducing cellular automaton. Unlike past examples of self-reproduction, it happens in parallel, since the number of time steps necessary is proportional to � (p), where p measures the information (number of bits) contained in the object to duplicate...|$|E

Be they ePub 3 e-books or apps for mobile devices, {{more and more of}} these digital works are created for commercial purposes and try to settle on the cultural industry market by adapting to the evolution of digital reading. This new generation of publishers is only discovering now the poetic potential of hypertext narratives and the endless possibilities that derive from the hybridisation of text, image, sound and video. Yet, they find themselves facing many obstacles throughout the design process. Psychologically, digital reading is often associated with disorientation, cognitive overload and discontinued ways of reading (as opposed to the immersive reading experience known with printed novels) (Gervais 1999  ; Baccino 2011). Economically, few examples of profitable models exist. Technically, many constraints emerge, on the one hand from the open and standardised ePub format, on the other from the ideology imposed by the software and <b>harware</b> industry. Bearing these elements in mind, publishers remain reluctant to offer hyperfictions to their readers and prefer investing in “traditional” models inherited from the print (i. e. models that still rely on pages, tables of content and linear reading) as well as fun, educational games, all of which tend to standardise new reading experiences...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundFractures of the {{proximal}} ulna are rare and usually managed surgically. Strong fixation of the <b>harware</b> {{is essential to}} obtain good outcomes. We report our experience with pre-contoured locking plate fixation of complex olecranon fractures and present a critical appraisal of the outcomes. HypothesisPre-contoured locking plates provide good outcomes, but their clinical tolerance may be limited in some instances. Materials and methodsFrom September 2009 to December 2011, 28 patients were managed using a pre-contoured locking compression plate (LCP®). Among them, 6 were excluded because of missing data, which left 22 patients (11 males and 11 females) {{with a mean age of}} 55. 7 years, including 12 who were employed. The fracture was on the dominant side in 11 patients. According to the Mayo Clinic classification, 15 fractures were type II and 7 type III. In addition to the ulnar fracture, a radial head fracture was present in 9 patients and a coronoid process fracture in 5 patients. Functional recovery was assessed using the Broberg-Morrey score and Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS). Radiographs were obtained to evaluate the quality of fracture reduction and fracture healing, as well as to look for ossifications and osteoarthritis. ResultsMean follow-up was 20 months. Flexion was 131 °, extension loss was 9. 5 °, pronation was 79 °, and supination was 80. 5 °. The mean Broberg-Morrey score was 96. 7 and the mean MEPS score 96. 6. Fracture healing occurred in all patients, within a mean of 10. 6 weeks. Evidence of early osteoarthritis was found in 6 patients, ossifications in 3 patients, and synostosis in 1 patient. An infection was successfully treated with lavage and antibiotic therapy in 1 patient. The fixation hardware was removed in 6 patients. No prognostic factors were identified. Discussion-conclusionOur hypothesis was confirmed. The outcomes are encouraging and comparable to those reported in the literature. The critical issue is the limited clinical tolerance of the plate with a high rate of posterior impingement requiring plate removal (27 %). Rigorous technique is essential during plate implantation.
