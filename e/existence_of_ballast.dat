50|$|The <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> the Amsterdamsche <b>Ballast</b> Maatschappij can be {{attributed}} to the Noordzeekanaal. Its original operations back in 1877 were simplicity itself: empty merchant ships going to sea obtained dune sand as ballast. In later years, the company also applied itself to dredging. In the first decade of the 20th century, the company began to grow under the direction of Charles de Vilder, a paver and roadworker based in Amsterdam. Ballast evolved from a sand supplier to a construction firm, and from 1928 onwards, also operated as a concrete manufacturer. The introduction of the first labour-saving excavator in 1927 marked the automation of sand extraction. After the Second World War, Ballast focused increasingly on dredging operations - and later, on civil engineering works too - abroad. The firm established its reputation within Dutch borders with the construction of the Afsluitdijk in 1932 and the Velser tunnels in 1957.|$|R
40|$|The {{foundation}} <b>of</b> <b>ballasted</b> railway {{is usually}} {{consisted of a}} graded layer of granular media <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> placed above naturally deposited subgrade. The ballast layer is responsible for limiting the vertical stress magnitudes applied to the weaker subgrade and also prevents the vertical and lateral train-induced sleeper movements. In recent years, the progressive use of faster and heavier trains has compromised the ability <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> to resist such movements due to the increased magnitude <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage (degradation). Therefore, accurate determination <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage is important. The amount <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage can be estimated by comparing the gradation (particle size distribution) curves of fresh and degraded ballast, using a ballast breakage index. However, the Australian railway authorities currently rely on the visual inspection for estimating ballast breakage. Despite {{the fact that the}} visual inspection is convenient, as it does not require transport <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> samples or testing, it is subjective and can lead to uneconomical maintenance cycles. In this paper, an attempt is made to utilise the digital imaging technique for gradation analysis and breakage estimation <b>of</b> <b>ballast.</b> The technique is fast and convenient, and can be applied to both the laboratory and field conditions, hence, can be used successfully to replace the visual inspection <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage...|$|R

In addition, most available methods do not represent true cyclic loading situations and rather provide oversimplified solutions based on static loading conditions.

40|$|A {{complete}} {{study was}} performed to develop correlations between electromagnetic and mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>ballast.</b> These correlations {{can be used to}} predict the deformation properties <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> and also its dynamic behavior under heavy axle load in different fouling and moisture conditions by GPR survey. By developing this technique and performing similar tests on different types <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> and fouling materials, a criterion can be developed to detect the railroad high risk areas and predict the engineering properties <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> by GPR surveys. This study was performed on granite ballast and breakdown fouling and has three phases: performing GPR survey on full-scale laboratory models with different amount of fouling and water content; performing box test with equivalent dynamic Heavy Axle Load (HAL) up to 2, 500, 000 cycles on the reconstituted samples of first phase; performing CIDC triaxial tests on the reconstituted samples of first phase. In these phases the effect of water content and fouling percentage on the electromagnetic, dynamic and static properties <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> was investigated and discussed quantitatively and qualitatively. In addition, existing correlations between electromagnetic and deformation properties <b>of</b> fouled <b>ballast</b> were studied in both time domain and frequency domain analyses from first and third phases.

40|$|Rail tracks undergo {{degradation}} {{owing to}} particle breakage and fouling <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> by various fines including coal and subgrade soil. As the ballast becomes fouled, its strength and drainage capacity are compromised, sometimes resulting in differential settlement and reduced track stability. This paper demonstrates a continuum mechanics based framework {{to evaluate the}} detrimental effect of fines on the strength, deformation and degradation <b>of</b> coal-fouled <b>ballast</b> under monotonic loading. An elastoplastic constitutive model that considers the effect of fines content and energy consumption associated with particle breakage during shearing is presented. This multiphase constitutive model is developed within a critical state framework based on a kinematic-type yield locus and a modified stress-dilatancy approach. A general formulation for the rate <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> breakage and coal particle breakage during triaxial shearing is presented and incorporated into the plastic flow rule to accurately predict the stress-strain response <b>of</b> coal-fouled <b>ballast</b> at various confining pressures. The behaviour <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> at various levels of fouling is analysed and validated by experimental data...|$|R

The test results showed that the FBG sensing system is fully capable of measuring the lateral displacement <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> under high-frequency cyclic loading. A comparison of strains obtained from FBGs installed at different depths along the ballast depth is made and the lateral strain profiles are measured. Moreover, an empirical model to convert the FBG strains to an equivalent lateral displacement <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> is proposed to effectively use this technology in real-time monitoring of track deformations...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ballast</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} {{commonly}} used construction materials in railway tracks. Under heavy train loads, ballast is subjected to a high stress level that is always associated with significant track deformation. Consequently, an accurate prediction of the mechanical behavior <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> under static and dynamic loading conditions is important for the stability of railway tracks. In this paper, the feasibility of using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for modeling the mechanical behavior <b>of</b> railway <b>ballast</b> under static loading is investigated. The database used {{for the development of the}} ANN model is obtained from selected literature and comprises a series of 29 large-scale drained triaxial compression tests conducted on three types <b>of</b> commonly used <b>ballast</b> (i. e., basalt, dolomite, and granite). Predictions from the ANN model are compared with the results of experimental tests and with those obtained from the hardening-soil constitutive model in PLAXIS finite-element code. The results indicate that the ANN model is able to accurately predict the stress–strain and volume change behavior <b>of</b> <b>ballast.</b> The plastic dilation and contraction <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> at various confining pressures and the strain-hardening and postpeak strain-softening behavior <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> are also well simulated.

40|$|For {{several hundred}} years, {{the design of}} railway tracks has {{practically}} remained unchanged. Traditionally, rail tracks are placed on a ballast layer due to several reasons, including economy, rapid drainage, and high load bearing capacity. The primary function <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> is to distributing dynamic track loads to sub-ballast and subgrade layers, while also providing lateral resistance and allowing for rapid drainage. Upon repeated trainloads, the ballast becomes fouled due to ballast degradation and the intrusion of fines which adversely affects the strength and deformation behaviour <b>of</b> <b>ballast.</b> This paper presents the use of three-dimensional discrete element method (DEM) in studying the shear behaviour <b>of</b> the fouled <b>ballast</b> subjected to direct shear loading. Irregularly shaped particles <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> were modelled by grouping many spherical balls together in appropriate sizes to simulate representative ballast aggregates. Fouled ballast was modelled by injecting a specified number of miniature spherical particles into the void spaces. The DEM simulation highlights that the peak shear stress <b>of</b> the <b>ballast</b> assembly decreases and the dilation <b>of</b> fouled <b>ballast</b> increases with an increase level of fouling. Additionally, the distributions of contact force chain and particle displacement vectors were captured during shearing progress, explaining the formation of shear band and the evolutions of volumetric change <b>of</b> fouled <b>ballast...</b>|$|R
