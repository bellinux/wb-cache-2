5|$|Beginning in the 1870s, {{entrepreneurs}} {{transformed the}} economy from small, craft-organized factories located {{inside the city}} limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.|$|E

5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining power because they have limited access to education, formal employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women who are able to work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E
5|$|Images {{of musical}} {{instruments}} begin {{to appear in}} Mesopotamian artifacts in 2800 BC or earlier. Beginning around 2000 BC, Sumerian and Babylonian cultures began delineating two distinct classes of musical instruments due to <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> and the evolving class system. Popular instruments, simple and playable by anyone, evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused on effectiveness and skill. Despite this development, very few musical instruments have been recovered in Mesopotamia. Scholars must rely on artifacts and cuneiform texts written in Sumerian or Akkadian to reconstruct {{the early history of}} musical instruments in Mesopotamia. Even the process of assigning names to these instruments is challenging since there is no clear distinction among various instruments and the words used to describe them.|$|E
5|$|The <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> for {{shooting}} the starship models was decided early on by effects cameramen Peter Daulton and Pat Sweeney. There was {{an equal amount}} of work if one crew did all the Enterprise shots and another did the Bird of Prey, Klingon cruiser and Excelsior shots, so the cameramen flipped to decide who worked on which models. Old and new techniques were applied to shooting the models. To make sure the vessels were seamlessly inserted into star fields in post-production, the crew filmed second passes in overexposed yellow light, which reduced light spillage onto the bluescreen backdrop. The yellow overcast was removed by filtration in the optical process, with the result being a clean edge around the ships.|$|E
40|$|Under what {{circumstances}} will married women perceive inequalities in the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labor</b> as unfair? This research develops and tests a model based on relative deprivation theory {{that suggests that}} gender ideology functions as a moderator variable in a process through which inequalities in the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labor</b> come {{to be seen as}} inequities. Using data from the National Survey of Families and Households, three empirical tests of the model provide evidence that inequalities in the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labor</b> are more strongly related to perceptions of inequity for egalitarian than for traditional wives, and that perceptions of inequity are more strongly related to perceived quality of the marital relationship for egalitarian than for traditional wives. The findings suggest that researchers studying the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labor</b> need to shift their focus away from analyses of objective inequalities and toward the study of perceived inequity. Gender-based inequality in the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labor</b> has become a key issue for scholars of marriage and the family. Research has found that althoug...|$|R

5|$|In many {{bacterial}} communities, {{natural or}} engineered (such as bioreactors), {{there is significant}} <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> in metabolism (Syntrophy), during which the waste products of some organisms are metabolites for others. In one such system, the methanogenic bioreactor, functional stability requires the presence of several syntrophic species (Syntrophobacterales and Synergistia) working together in order to turn raw resources into fully metabolized waste (methane). Using comparative gene studies and expression experiments with microarrays or proteomics researchers can piece together a metabolic network that goes beyond species boundaries. Such studies require detailed knowledge about which versions of which proteins are coded by which species and even by which strains of which species. Therefore, community genomic information is another fundamental tool (with metabolomics and proteomics) in the quest to determine how metabolites are transferred and transformed by a community.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Plains Aborigines were matrilineal/matrifocal societies. A man {{married into}} a woman's family after a {{courtship}} {{period during which}} the woman was free to reject as many men as she wished. In the age-grade communities, couples entered into marriage in their mid-30s when a man {{would no longer be}} required to perform military service or hunt heads on the battle-field. In the matriarchal system of the Siraya, it was also necessary for couples to abstain from marriage until their mid-30s, when the bride's father would be in his declining years and would not pose a challenge to the new male member of the household. It was not until the arrival of the Dutch Reformed Church in the 17th century that the marriage and child-birth taboos were abolished. There is some indication that many of the younger members of Sirayan society embraced the Dutch marriage customs as a means to circumvent the age-grade system in a push for greater village power. Almost all indigenous peoples in Taiwan have traditionally had a custom of sexual <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labor.</b> Women did the sewing, cooking and farming, while the men hunted and prepared for military activity and securing enemy heads in headhunting raids, which was a common practice in early Taiwan. Women were also often found in the office of priestesses or mediums to the gods.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the men of}} Ifaluk atoll, costly {{signalling}} {{theory can}} also explain why men torch fish. Torch fishing is a ritualized method of fishing on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch fishing requires significant time investments and involves {{a great deal of}} organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch fishing results in net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, torch fishing is a handicap that serves to signal men’s productivity. Torch fishing is the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers’ reputations during the torch fishing season. Several ritual behavioural and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participated {{on the first day of}} the fishing season. The community is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers. Second, torch fishers receive all of their meals at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working mates. With the distinct sexual <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>labor</b> on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. Torch fishing thus provides women with reliable information on the work ethic of prospective mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 The {{researcher}} 1) explored Thai employed wives' perceived {{fairness in}} the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labor</b> and child care, 2) investigated factors determining Thai's working wives' perception of fairness in the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labor</b> and child care, and 3) developed {{a model of}} the determinants of wives' perceived fairness in the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labor</b> and child care. In the model above, relationships were explored between perceived fairness and twenty independent variables. The data are based on a survey administered to 600 employed wives from three different kinds of workplaces in Bangkok, Thailand: Government sector (n= 214), quasi-government sector (n= 191) and private sector (n= 195). Employed wives were recruited by purposive sampling from each workplace. In addition qualitative interviews were used with a convenience sample of 30 employed wives selected by purposive sampling from the large sample of 600. The interview data suggest explanations for wives' perceived fairness in the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labor</b> and child care. Stepwise multiple regression was used to develop {{a model of the}} determinants predicting wives' perceived fairness in the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labor</b> and child care.
