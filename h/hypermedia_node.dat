40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} an {{approach}} that tries to blur the distinction between adaptive hypermedia and dynamic hypermedia. The approach aims at finding an optimal trade-off between resource reuse and flexibility: existing atomic pieces of data are collected and properly annotated; at the interaction time, the system dynamically builds the <b>nodes</b> of the <b>hypermedia</b> composing different pieces together. The proposed annotation formalism is illustrated and a rule-based system to compose <b>hypermedia</b> <b>nodes</b> exploiting different knowledge sources is presented. Finally, the advantages of this approach with respect to adaptation and dynamic generation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a model and}} tools to store and replay user experiences in mixed environments. The experience is stored {{as a set of}} <b>hypermedia</b> <b>nodes</b> and links, with the information that was displayed along with the video of the real world that was navigated. It uses a generic hypermedia model implemented as software components developed to handle mixed reality environments. The mechanisms for storing and replaying the experience are part of this model. The paper presents the goals of the system, the underlying hypermedia model, and the preliminary tools that we are developing...|$|R
50|$|Frames {{are always}} fixed-size, meaning {{scrolling}} is not needed. The frame model is spatial rather than character based, so that text, graphics and images may always be placed {{anywhere in the}} frame, even overlapping one another. Another way {{to say this is}} that empty space in the frame actually denotes space, not (as in many text editors) just the absence of content. Frames being fixed in size scrolling as a form of interaction is eliminated (as the designers felt that scrolling is suboptimal) opting instead for larger aggregates such as documents and programs to be structured as hierarchies (or more generally, lattices) of <b>hypermedia</b> <b>nodes.</b> This flexibility makes it possible to create a document, search, run programs from a tree of frames starting at any frame.|$|R
40|$|Interaction with an {{adaptive}} hypertext {{can be seen}} as a form of "goal-oriented" dialogue, where the user asks for information through a set of predefined queries and the system answers ensuring that the global communicative goal of the information process is achieved through a sequence of dialogue sections (<b>hypermedia</b> <b>nodes).</b> The system establishes what to say to the user at every turn of the dialogue based on the user model settings and on the interaction history. Planning on demand the information content of a hypertext node that responds to a particular link selection in a particular context requires a 'reactive' approach; this differs from common hypertext planning in that it applies local adjustment criteria to an overall plan and, in mixed-initiative situations, tries to fit together the system's and the user's points of view.

40|$|Interaction with an {{adaptive}} hypertext {{can be seen}} as a form of "goal-oriented" dialogue, where the user asks for information through a set of predefined queries and the system answers by ensuring that the global communicative goal of the information process is achieved through a sequence of dialogue sections (<b>hypermedia</b> <b>nodes).</b> This is a planning problem, in which the system tries to develop a coherent dialogue with the user, based on assumptions in the user model that are refined through link selection. Therefore, planning has to be reactive in order to relate link selection to activation of a process that allows generating and executing a "relevant" plan for that particular interaction context. In this paper I briefly describe an approach to dynamic hypermedia planning where these issues are taken into account. Submission to other conferences None Eligibility criteria I'm a third-year Ph.

Constitui-se em uma pesquisa de carÃter qualitativo, que se vale da anÃlise de conteÃdo como mÃtodo e de {{check-list}} como instrumento. Os dados se revelam a partir de duas aulas, das disciplinas de FÃsica e Literatura, construÃdas pelo Centro de ProduÃÃo, do Instituto UFC Virtual. O checklist se divide em trÃs categorias denominadas de: teias pedagÃgicas, usabilidade e nÃs hipermidiÃticos. Cada categoria segmenta-se em critÃrios avaliados em uma escala variando de 1 (completamente inadequada) a 5 (totalmente adequada). As aulas sÃo avaliadas em trÃs fases distintas: a aula desenvolvida pelo professor-autor, a revista pelo profissional da transiÃÃo didÃtica e a publicada no espaÃo virtual de aprendizagem, permitindo uma compreensÃo sobre a sua evoluÃÃo durante a produÃÃo. Os resultados mostram que: hÃ diretrizes definidas para uma aÃÃo conjunta e multidisciplinar de elaboraÃÃo dos materiais; a aÃÃo de cada sujeito nas diferentes fases, pode definir a adequaÃÃo ou inadequaÃÃo das unidades de aprendizagem; sÃo poucas as correlaÃÃes feitas entre os materiais e os AVAs e que existe uma deficiÃncia por parte dos profissionais no seu entendimento, acerca das potencilidades da usabilidade e dos nÃs hipermidiÃticos. Tais resultados ressaltam os papÃis dos sujeitos no percurso de construÃÃo dos materiais, evidenciando que ainda hÃ indefiniÃÃes sobre os elementos constitutivos dos materiais e sobre as mudanÃas necessÃrias para que os sujeitos os identifiquem, entendam e utilizem. This work {{tries to}} evaluate the development of teaching material for Distance Education in Network, in order to suggest new possibilities for its development. Is a qualitative research, which uses content analysis as method and checklist as tool. The data show from two classes, physics and literature, constituted by the Production Center, of the Virtual Institute UFC. The checklist {{is divided into three}} categories refered to as: educacional website, usability and <b>hypermedia</b> <b>nodes.</b> Each category is segmented into based on criteria rated on a scale ranging from 1 (completely inadequate) to 5 (totally appropriate). Classes are evaluated in three distinct phases: a lesson developed by the teacher-author, reviewed by professional of the didactic transition and published in a virtual learning environment, allowing an understanding of its evolution during production. The results show that: there are guidelines set for joint action and multidisciplinary development of materials; the action of each subject at different stages can define the adequacy or inadequacy of the learning units; are few the correlations made between the materials and AVAs; {{and that there is a}} deficiency, by the professionals in their understanding about the capabilities of the usability and of <b>hypermedia</b> <b>nodes.</b> These results highlight the roles of the subject in the course of drawing materials, showing that there are still many unknowns regarding the components of the materials,and on necessary changes to ensure that the subject identify, understand and use...|$|R

40|$|The PHIDIAS II HyperCAD system {{combines}} the functionality of CAD graphics, hypermedia, database management and knowledge-based computation {{in a single}}, highly integrated design environment. The CAD functionality includes both 3 -D and 2 -D vector graphics. The hypermedia includes support for text, raster images, video and sound. The database management enables persistent storage and interlinking of large collections of text, images, video, sound and vector graphics, i. e., thousands of vector graphic objects and drawings in a single database. Retrieval is provided both through use of “associative indexing” based on hyperlinks and through use of an advanced query language. The knowledge- based computation includes both inference and knowledgebased critiquing.   A highly unusual feature of PHIDIAS II is that it implements all of its functions using only hypermedia mechanisms. Complex vector graphic drawings and objects are represented as composite <b>hypermedia</b> <b>nodes.</b> Inference and critiquing are implemented through use of {{what are known as}} virtual structures [Halasz 1988], including virtual links and virtual nodes. These nodes and links are dynamic (computed) rather than static (constant). They are defined as expressions in the same language used for queries and are computed at display time. The implementation of different kinds of functions using a common set of mechanisms makes it easy to use them in combination, thus further augmenting the system's functionality.   PHIDIAS supports design by informing architects as they develop a solution's form. The idea is thus not to make the design process faster or cheaper but rather {{to improve the quality of}} the things designed. We believe that architects can create better buildings for their users if they have better information. This includes information about buildings of given types, user populations, historical and modern precedents, local site and climate conditions, the urban and natural context and its historical development, as well as local, state and federal regulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of architectural CAD systems implies a trend {{of using a}} comprehensive building model as the storage space for all relevant data about one design project. Instead {{of a set of}} drawing files, a building is represented as a collection of building object data and their relationships. In order to create and manipulate this complex organizational structure, we have to empower the CAD system with a more sophiSticated manipulating tool than it now possess. Hypermedia, as an associative way of organizing and presenting information, is able to support the practical requirements of designers. The thesis approaches the idea from two aspects: one is to represent a building model in a data structure, based on <b>hypermedIa</b> <b>nodes</b> and links. During this authoring process, we should create a hypermedia structure which can not only cope with the original building data structure but also provide the structural basis we can use in inquiring for buIlding data in the design process. The second aspect is to browse for building information in a model embedded in a hypermedia structure. The possibilities it provides can go far beyond the constraints of conventional organizational methods. The way we access building data can be greatly broadened. The flexibility and interactivity of hypermedia are leading us to better desIgn environments, with more machine power and intelligence being brought to architectural CAD systems. From the viewpoint of system analysis, the ideas and methods, together with the potential problems the thesis discusses will be of value to the real practice of creating and managing this kind of data structure in future architectural CAD systems. by Jian Zhao.

40|$|HySpirit is a {{retrieval}} {{engine for}} hypermedia retrieval integrating concepts from information retrieval (IR) and deductive databases. The logical view on IR models retrieval as uncertain inference, {{for which we}} use probabilistic reasoning. Since the expressiveness of classical IR models is not sufficient for hypermedia retrieval, HySpirit {{is based on a}} probabilistic version of Datalog. In <b>hypermedia</b> retrieval, different <b>nodes</b> may contain contradictory information; thus, we introduce probabilistic four-valued Datalog. In order to support fact queries as well as contentbased retrieval, HySpirit is based on an open world assumption, but allows for predicate-specific closed world assumptions. For performing efficient retrieval on large databases, our system provides access to external data. We demonstrate the application of HySpirit by giving examples for retrieval on images, structured documents and large databases. 1 Introduction Due to the advances in hardware, processing of multimed [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an object-oriented approach to specifying the user interface of a hypermedia application using the Abstract Data Views (ADVs) concept. We discuss ADVs {{in the context}} of an object-oriented hypermedia design method (OOHDM) showing how to specify the interface aspects of <b>hypermedia</b> objects including <b>nodes,</b> links and access structures such as indexes and guided tours using high-level abstraction and composition mechanisms such as aggregation and generalization/specialization. We state that (ADVs) make it possible to describe, in an abstract, implementationindependent way, a number of relationships including the media objects perceived by the user of the hypermedia application, the mode of interaction with these objects, and the interface transformations that occur while navigating through the hypermedia. In addition, we present ADVcharts and Configuration Diagrams as a design tool to specify both the interface and the static relationships between interface objects and n [...] ...|$|R
