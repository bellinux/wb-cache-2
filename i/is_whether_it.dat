5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, the object of the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> is reasonable, taking into consideration the object of the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute. The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|The colossal heads {{cannot be}} {{precisely}} dated. However, the San Lorenzo heads were buried by 900BC, indicating that their period of manufacture and use was earlier still. The heads from Tres Zapotes {{had been moved}} from their original context before they were investigated by archaeologists and the heads from La Venta were found partially exposed on the modern ground surface. The period of production of the colossal heads is therefore unknown, as <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> spanned a century or a millennium. Estimates of the time span during which colossal heads were produced vary from 50 to 200 years. The San Lorenzo heads {{are believed to be}} the oldest, and are the most skillfully executed. All of the stone heads have been assigned to the Preclassic period of Mesoamerican chronology, generally to the Early Preclassic (1500–1000BC), although the two Tres Zapotes heads and the La Cobata Head are attributed to the Middle Preclassic (1000–400BC).|$|E
5|$|Provincial, Territorial, Voivodeship or County (Polish: ziemski, Latin conventiones particulares, conventiones terrestrae). The {{names of}} these sejmiks varied {{depending}} on their administrative level and local traditions; Płaza lists powiat sejmiks (county sejmiks; sejmiki powiatowe), ziemia sejmiks (territorial sejmiks; sejmiki ziemskie), voivodeship sejmiks (sejmiki wojewódzkie) and provincial sejmiks (sejmiki prowincjonalne). A theoretical hierarchy that almost never existed in practice could be drawn starting from the powiat sejmiks, and moving upwards to ziemia, voivodeship, general (of several voivodeships) and provincial sejmiks ending with the final, national sejm. Almost all ziemias had their own sejmiks, but {{the importance of the}} sejmik varied based on whether the given ziemia was autonomous (that <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was part of a voivodeship). Powiat sejms were common in Lithuania, but were rare in the Crown of Poland, where instead voivodeship sejms were much more common. Some voivodeships could hold a single voivodeship sejmik, and others might be covered by more than one sejmik. The importance of the local sejmiks began to diminish with the formation of the national sejm. Thereafter the local sejmiks were relegated to dealing with local matters and electing deputies to the General Sejms. They rose in importance again {{in the second half of}} the 17th century, as the central Sejm grew weaker.|$|E

25|$|Waveplates are {{constructed}} {{out of a}} birefringent material (such as quartz or mica), for which the index of refraction is different for different orientations of light passing through it. The behavior of a waveplate (that <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> is a half-wave plate, a quarter-wave plate, etc.) depends on {{the thickness of the}} crystal, the wavelength of light, and the variation of the index of refraction. By appropriate choice of the relationship between these parameters, it is possible to introduce a controlled phase shift between the two polarization components of a light wave, thereby altering its polarization.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the mysteries}} about Leptictidium <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> moved by running or by jumping. Because {{there are very few}} {{completely}} bipedal mammals, it is difficult to find an appropriate living model to compare it with. If the kangaroo is used, it is probable that Leptictidium hopped along with its body tilted forward, using its tail as a counterweight. On the other hand, elephant shrews combine both types of locomotion; they usually move on four legs, but they can run on two legs to flee from a predator. Studies of the bone structure of Leptictidium have yielded contradicting information: its leg articulations appear too weak to have supported the shock of repeated jumps, but its long feet were obviously adapted for jumping rather than running.|$|E

500|$|However, for {{cellular}} automata {{with other}} neighborhoods {{in two or}} more dimensions, the problem of testing reversibility is undecidable, meaning that there cannot exist an algorithm that always halts and always correctly answers the problem. The proof of this fact by [...] {{is based on the}} previously known undecidability of tiling the plane by Wang tiles, sets of square tiles with markings on their edges that constrain which pairs of tiles can fit edge-to-edge. Kari defines a cellular automaton from a set of Wang tiles, such that the automaton fails to be injective if and only if the given tile set can tile the entire plane. His construction uses the von Neumann neighborhood, and cells with large numbers of states. In the same paper, Kari also showed that it is undecidable to test whether a given cellular automaton rule of two or more dimensions is surjective (that <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> has a Garden of Eden).|$|E

500|$|In July 1946, the Chiefs of Staff Committee {{recommended}} that Britain acquire nuclear weapons. They estimated that 200 bombs {{would be required}} by 1957. Despite this, and the research and construction of production facilities {{that had already been}} approved, there was still no official decision to proceed with making atomic bombs. Portal submitted a proposal to do so at the 8 January 1947 meeting of the Gen 163 Committee, a subcommittee of the Gen 75 Committee, which agreed to proceed with the development of atomic bombs. It also endorsed his proposal to place Penney, now the Chief Superintendent Armament Research (CSAR) at Fort Halstead in Kent, in charge of the bomb development effort, which was codenamed High Explosive Research.

500|$|The {{doctrine}} of wrongful delegation is sometimes {{said to be}} a reflection of the Latin maxim delegatus non potest delegare (a delegate cannot appoint another), which means that a body to which or person to whom power was delegated by Parliament cannot further delegate the power to another. Academics have submitted that the maxim does not state a rule of law, but is [...] "at most a rule of construction" [...] and in applying it to a statute [...] "there, of course must be a consideration of the language of the whole enactment and of its purposes and objects". Thus, in reality, there is no such principle as delegatus non potest delegare; the maxim plays no real part in the decision of cases but is sometimes used as a convenient label. Consequently, in most cases the courts have adopted such a construction as will best accord with the facts of modern governmental agencies. For statutory powers, the important question <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> is intended that a power conferred upon A may be exercised on A's authority by B. The maxim is merely the pencil with which the court is able to draw the line between authorized and unauthorized sub-delegation, and the courts must then ask whether statutory discretion remains {{in the hands of the}} proper authority, or whether some other person purports to exercise it. Thus where an Act said that an inspector of nuisances [...] "may procure any sample" [...] of goods for analysis, it was held that the inspector might validly send his assistant to buy a sample of coffee, as he had in no way authorized his assistant to exercise the discretion legally reposed in himself. Ultimately, the courts must decide the issue based on what Parliament has authorized according to what may be summarized as the language, scope and objects of the empowering statute.|$|E
