50|$|Orbital {{riveting}} machines have {{a spinning}} <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> (known as a peen) which is gradually {{lowered into the}} rivet which spreads the material of the rivet into a desired shape depending upon {{the design of the}} tool.

50|$|There are {{different}} types of <b>form</b> <b>tools.</b> Insert <b>form</b> <b>tools</b> {{are the most common}} for short- to medium-range jobs (50 to 20,000 pcs). Circular <b>form</b> <b>tools</b> are usually for longer jobs, since the tool wear can be ground off the tool tip many times as the tool is rotated in its holder. There is also a skiving tool {{that can be used for}} light finishing cuts. <b>Form</b> <b>tools</b> can be made of cobalt steel, carbide, or high-speed steel. Carbide requires additional care because it is very brittle and will chip if chatter occurs.|$|R
50|$|A <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> is precision-ground into {{a pattern}} that resembles the part to be <b>formed.</b> The <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> {{can be used as}} a single {{operation}} and therefore eliminate many other operations from the slides (front, rear and/or vertical) and the turret, such as box <b>tools.</b> A <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> turns one or more diameters while feeding into the work. Before the use of <b>form</b> <b>tools,</b> diameters were turned by multiple slide and turret operations, and thus took more work to make the part. For example, a <b>form</b> <b>tool</b> can turn many diameters and in addition can also cut off the part in a single operation and eliminate the need to index the turret. For single-spindle machines, bypassing the need to index the turret can dramatically increase hourly part production rates.|$|R

50|$|Impact {{riveting}} machines set the rivet {{by driving}} the rivet downwards, through the materials {{to be joined}} and on into a <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> (known as a rollset). This action causes {{the end of the}} rivet to roll over in the rollset which causes the end of the rivet to flare out and thus join the materials together. Impact riveting machines are very fast and a cycle time of 0.5 seconds is typical.|$|E

50|$|Wet layup forming {{combines}} fibre reinforcement and {{the matrix}} {{as they are}} placed on the <b>forming</b> <b>tool.</b> Reinforcing Fibre layers are placed in an open mould and then saturated with a wet resin by pouring it over the fabric and working it into the fabric. The mould is then left so that the resin will cure, usually at room temperature, though heat is sometimes used to ensure a proper cure. Sometimes a vacuum bag is used to compress a wet layup. Glass fibres are most commonly used for this process, the results are widely known as fibreglass, and is used to make common products like skis, canoes, kayaks and surf boards.|$|E
50|$|Due to the plastic-elastic {{characteristic}} of a metals it is typical that any deformation of sheet metal at room temperature will have both elastic and plastic deformation. After the metal work piece {{is removed from the}} tool or deformation implement that the elastic deformation will be released and only the plastic deformation remain. When a metal <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> is planned and designed to deform a work piece, the shape imparted by the tool will be a combination of elastic and plastic deformation, the release of the elastic deformation is the spring back often observed {{at the end of a}} metal forming process. The spring back has to be compensated to achieve an accurate result.Usually that is realized by overbending the material correspondent to the magnitude of the spring back.That means for the practical side of the bending process, the bending former enters deeper into the bending prism.|$|E
5000|$|A {{drawback}} {{when using}} <b>form</b> <b>tools</b> {{is that the}} feed into the work is usually slow, 0.0005" [...] to 0.0012" [...] per revolution depending on {{the width of the}} <b>tool.</b> Wide <b>form</b> <b>tools</b> create more heat and usually are problematic for chatter. Heat and chatter reduces <b>tool</b> life. Also, <b>form</b> <b>tools</b> wider than 2.5 times the smaller diameter of the part being turned have a greater risk of the part breaking off. [...] When turning longer lengths, a support from the turret can be used to increase turning length from 2.5 times to 5 times the smallest diameter of the part being turned, and this also can help reduce chatter. Despite the drawbacks, the elimination of extra operations often makes using <b>form</b> <b>tools</b> the most efficient option.|$|R

40|$|Sheet-bulk {{metal forming}} {{is a new}} {{production}} process capable of performing deep-drawing and massive forming steps in a single operation. However, due to the high forming forces of the forming process, continuous process control is {{required in order to}} detect wear on the <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> before production quality is impacted. To be able to measure the geometry of the <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> in the limited space of forming presses, a new inspection system is being developed within the SFB/TR 73 collaborative research center. In addition to the limited space, the process restricts the amount of time available for inspection. Existing areal optical measurement systems suffer from shadowing when measuring the tool's inner elements, as they cannot be placed in the limited space next to the tool, while tactile measurement systems cannot meet the time restrictions for measuring the areal geometries. The new inspection system uses the fringe projection optical measurement principle to capture areal geometry data from relevant parts of the <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> in short time. Highresolution image fibers are used to connect the system's compact sensor head to a base unit containing both camera and projector of the fringe projection system, which can be positioned outside of the moving parts of the press. To enable short measurement times, a high intensity laser source is used in the projector in combination with a digital micro-mirror device. Gradient index lenses are featured in the sensor head to allow for a very compact design {{that can be used in}} the narrow space above the <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> inside the press. The sensor head is attached to an extended arm, which also guides the image fibers to the base unit. A rotation stage offers the possibility to capture measurements of different functional elements on the circular <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> by changing the orientation of the sensor head next to the <b>forming</b> <b>tool.</b> During operation of the press, the arm can be travelled out of the moving parts of the forming press. To further reduce the measurement times of the fringe projection system, the inverse fringe projection principle has been adapted to the system to detect geometry deviations in a single camera image. Challenges arise from vibrations of both the forming machine and the positioning stages, which are transferred via the extended arm to the sensor head. Vibrations interfere with the analysis algorithms of both encoded and inverse fringe projection and thus impair measurement accuracy. To evaluate the impact of vibrations on the endoscopic system, results of measurements of simple geometries under the influence of vibrations are discussed. The effect of vibrations is imitated by displacing the measurement specimen during the measurement with a linear positioning stage. The concept of the new inspection system is presented within the scope of the TR 73 demonstrational sheet-bulk metal forming process. Finally, the capabilities of the endoscopic fringe projection system are shown by measurements of gearing structures on a <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> compared to a CAD-reference. © 2015 SPIE...|$|E
40|$|When {{designing}} the forming heads for production of profile-molded products {{must be considered}} patterns of manifestation of elastic recovery polymer melt {{and the degree of}} slip {{on the walls of the}} <b>forming</b> <b>tool.</b> The study aims to account for the influence of viscoelastic properties of polymer melts at changing the structure of the flow after the forming of the channel, which in turn leads to the need for change as a process of extrusion process parameters and structural dimensions of the <b>forming</b> <b>tool.</b> When designing extrusion dies the elastic properties of the melt, i. e. the ability of the melt to store an imposed de-formation elastically (memory fluid) are generally not considered. The elastic properties bring about effects, however, that are important for the design of the die. Neglecting the elasticity of a melt can lead to relatively large errors in the computation of the pressure loss, demonstration this with an example of flow of a high molecular and hence highly elastic PE-HD through a blow molding head. The effect of viscoelastisity on the results in even more pronounced in the computation of the extrudate swelling. Extrusion swelling phenomenon is expanding jet of polymer melt exits the <b>forming</b> <b>tool.</b> Expanding the jet may be due to two factors. The first is the manifestation of the elastic properties of the liquid. The second ? a restructuring velocity profile in the transition from the regime of fluid flow to Poiseuille flow with a free surface. Tanner showed that the expansion of the jet is the interaction of both mechanisms. In the production of polymer products by extrusion cross-section extruded polymer jet is increased compared to the channel cross-section profiling, which affects the final size and shape of the product. In technological practice, evaluate the effect of swelling ratio of extrudate diameter to the diameter of the forming channel. In the extrusion of complex profiles heterogeneity swelling of various elements of the intersection due to the fact that in different parts forming channels are different tensions that is the cause of viscoelastic deformation of various sizes. This may lead to a distortion of the profile up to a total inability to obtain the desired product configuration using a <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> with a specific configuration forming channels.
