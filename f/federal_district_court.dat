40|$|This Article {{proposes a}} Rule {{concerning}} the admission {{to practice law}} in <b>federal</b> <b>district</b> <b>courts</b> and is designed {{to account for the}} recent changes in the practice of law. The Rule is based on the theory that lawyers will act ethically by handling only those legal matters within their competence and that clients (consumers) will act intelligently when hiring a lawyer. The proposed Rule will not result in a system of perfect client representation by lawyers in <b>federal</b> <b>district</b> <b>courts,</b> but will provide the <b>federal</b> <b>district</b> <b>courts</b> with some assurance of lawyer competence. This Article first sets forth the various and chaotic rules concerning admission of lawyers to practice law before <b>federal</b> <b>district</b> <b>courts.</b> Second, an examination and criticism of previous federal bar admission proposals is given. Finally, this Article explains the basis for the proposed Rule...|$|R

5|$|Heffernan brought suit {{alleging that}} his {{demotion}} violated his First Amendment rights. The case took {{a decade to}} reach the Supreme Court.

50|$|A {{study of}} the <b>federal</b> <b>district</b> <b>courts</b> in the mid-1980s found that they had {{developed}} {{a broad range of}} approaches to filling in the critical gaps in the FRCP. These ranged from a single local rule in the Middle District of Georgia, to the 34 local rules of the Central District of California (which were loaded with so many subparts that they actually amounted to 434 local rules). The original version of the bill that became the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 included a clause that would have impliedly forced the federal judiciary to develop and adopt a truly comprehensive package of procedural rules that would be uniformly applied in all <b>federal</b> <b>district</b> <b>courts.</b> The draft bill encountered a frosty reception from judges and lawyers throughout the United States, as everyone feared that their own favorite local procedure might fall victim to such a standardization process. The final version of the bill was heavily watered down so that it merely required all <b>federal</b> <b>district</b> <b>courts</b> to appoint committees of local attorneys and judges to study the possibility of reorganizing and simplifying their local rules. In the end, most but not all <b>federal</b> <b>district</b> <b>courts</b> restructured their local rules to follow a uniform format promulgated by the Judicial Conference of the United States, but they continued to maintain most of their unique local idiosyncrasies.|$|R

5|$|The {{members of}} 2 Live Crew responded to these efforts by suing the Broward County sheriff in <b>federal</b> <b>district</b> <b>court.</b> The sheriff had {{previously}} told local retailers that selling the album {{could result in}} a prosecution for obscenity violations. While they were granted an injunction because law enforcement actions were an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech, the court ruled that the album was in fact obscene. However, an appellate court reversed the obscenity ruling, because simply playing the tape was insufficient evidence of the constitutional requirement that it had no artistic value.|$|E

5|$|Thompkins appealed his {{conviction}} {{on grounds that}} included suppression of his admission—that he had invoked and not waived his right to remain silent—and deficient representation related to improper jury instructions, but the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected Thompkins' Miranda claim.

5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland court ordered him to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible.
