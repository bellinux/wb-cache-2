As silent films became popular, theatre organs were installed in theatres to provide accompaniment for the films.|$|E

5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{seems to}} have been laid out on a single occasion and used for only a short time afterwards. It is thought that the mourners would have entered through the south side and assembled in the empty south-western area of the cemetery before proceeding to the shrine to carry out the burial rites. After interring the deceased in a grave they may <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> eastern entrance to leave the cemetery. Alternatively, different groups of people may <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> two entrances, perhaps reflecting {{the fact that some of}} the graves do not fit into the overall square plan and may therefore belong to a different group.|$|E

The highest recorded daily usage was 181,990 vehicles on 23 July 2004; since then traffic levels have decreased.

The total {{income for the}} financial year ended 31 March 2012 was £72,147,091, while the corresponding figure for the following financial year was £80,331,662. A 2016 report by Highways England suggested the crossing is used around 50 million times a year.|$|E
5|$|A {{very similar}} archway {{is found in}} Dieric Bouts's c. 1445 Mary Altarpiece, {{including}} spandrels with warriors. Art historians are unsure which was painted earlier– Christus's Nativity or Bouts's altarpiece. Equally, van der Weyden's arched triptychs were executed {{at roughly the same}} period, but art historians are more certain Rogier's archivolt design set the precedent. Unlike Bouts and van der Weyden, Christus appears to <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> device to encompass a single scene, incorporating all the main characters within the arch, instead of a linked series of scenes with separate archways.|$|E
5|$|Above the {{entrance}} to the chapel is an oriel that, until the 1880s, was a room on the first floor that formed part of a set of rooms that were occupied by Richard Whately, and later by John Henry Newman. Whately is said to <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> space as a larder and Newman is said to have used it for his private prayers — when the organ was installed in 1884, the space was used for the blower. The wall that once separated the room from the ante-chapel was removed, making it accessible from the chapel. The organ was built by J. W. Walker & Sons in 1988; in 1991 the space behind the organ was rebuilt as an oratory and memorial to Newman and the Oxford Movement. A new stained glass window designed by Vivienne Haig and realised by Douglas Hogg was completed and installed in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection {{of some of the}} Bill of Rights to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the Bill of Rights to state and local governments.

5|$|Although {{the assault}} {{is known to}} popular history as Pickett's Charge, overall command was given to James Longstreet, and Pickett {{was one of his}} {{division}}al commanders. Lee did tell Longstreet that Pickett's fresh division should lead the assault, so the name is appropriate, although some recent historians <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> name Pickett-Pettigrew-Trimble Assault (or, less frequently, Longstreet's Assault) to more fairly distribute the credit (or blame). With Hill sidelined, Pettigrew's and Trimble's divisions were delegated to Longstreet's authority as well. Thus, Pickett's name has been lent to a charge in which he commanded 3 out of the 11 brigades while under the supervision of his corps commander throughout. Pickett's men were almost exclusively from Virginia, with the other divisions consisting of troops from North Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. The supporting troops under Wilcox and Lang were from Alabama and Florida.|$|E
