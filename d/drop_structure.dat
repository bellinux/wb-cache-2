2500|$|Steelhead trout (coastal rainbow trout) (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) {{occurred}} historically in Adobe Creek {{based on}} a report touting the trout in the Sportsman Gazetteer in 1877. This very early report makes rumors that Adobe Creek's trout were introduced extremely unlikely since the first trout hatcheries in California did not propagate any trout until the 1870s, and much of their production was shipped to hatcheries out of state. A physical specimen was collected in 1893 by Stanford Biology Professor W. W. Thoburn {{and is in the}} California Academy of Sciences collection. In 1898 John Otterbein Snyder collected steelhead trout specimens in San Antonio Creek (now Adobe Creek). A 1909 land office brochure promoted Los Altos for its [...] "never-failing mountain trout stream, trout caught a few feet from kitchen doors". The reaches upstream from Hidden Villa have been judged excellent trout spawning habitat. Josephine Duveneck wrote, [...] "Before the era of concrete, fish used to swim up to spawn and native trout lured many a small boy to seek out the deeper pools carrying his home-made fishing pole and can of worms." [...] Local historian Florence Fava also reported that [...] "the creeks which lace the (Hidden Villa) property and join Adobe Creek were originally full of fish". Steelhead often were caught using large wet flies with 2x tippet during the early 1970s. [...] Locations that held spawning steelhead included the large cement pieces downstream from the Foothill Junior College paint shop outflow and cut banks just below Interstate 280. [...] According to the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), steelhead were caught by local fishermen during 1985, 1986 and 1987 in Mayfield Slough at the confluence of Matadero and Adobe Creeks. At least six steelhead were noted passing the tidal gates at Mayfield Slough in the Palo Alto Flood Basin in April 1987. There are many formidable obstacles to fish passage on Adobe Creek, including the culverts at the El Camino Real and Interstate 280 overpasses, a <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> at the Foothill College bridge and the long concrete trapezoidal channel structure from El Camino Real northward to Highway 101. Additional barriers occur at the O'Keefe Lane and Hidden Villa bridges, and the creek suffers from significant bank erosion, failing channel stabilization structures, and sedimentation. Finally, the trash rack at the tidal gate at the mouth of Mayfield Slough is an intermittent complete barrier to fish passage when it is closed.|$|E

50|$|A grouted sloping boulder <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> is {{the most}} {{versatile}} of drop structures. Able to accommodate both a broad floodplain or a narrow channel, they can also handle many different drop heights. Heights of these structures usually range from 1 ft to 10 ft.

50|$|Human {{activities}} {{have led to}} the loss of over 80 percent of suitable spawning habitat for fall-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River watersheds. Straightening of lower Marsh Creek for flood control steepened its gradient relative to its original meandering course, requiring construction of a 6 foot m waterfall <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> in 1958 below Marsh Creek Dam (4 miles from the creek mouth). The <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> and the Marsh Creek Reservoir dam (constructed in 1963) are complete barriers to anadromous fish migration. Below the dam and above the <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> barrier, there is approximately 7 mi suitable gravel quality, quantity, and vegetative cover to support Chinook salmon spawning. The presence of coastal rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) has not been established in fish surveys of Marsh Creek above the <b>drop</b> <b>structure.</b> In December 2010, American Rivers, the Natural Heritage Institute and the Contra Costa Water District (CCWD), constructed a $400,000 fish ladder that made passage of the <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> possible {{for the first time in}} 52 years, enabling Chinook salmon and steelhead to potentially use the next 7 mi of stream channel, up to the Marsh Creek Reservoir Dam, as well as the Sand Creek and Deer Creek tributaries. The Friends of Marsh Creek Watershed citizen salmon monitoring program had identified salmon congregating immediately below the <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> barrier prior to construction of the fish ladder. On December 2, 2012, Chinook salmon were videotaped above the fish ladder between Balfour and Central Avenue. By December 2016, Chinook salmon numbering in the hundreds used the fish ladder and returned to Marsh Creek to spawn.|$|E

5000|$|The {{vertical}} hard basin <b>drop</b> <b>structure,</b> {{also called}} a dissipation wall, {{is the basic}} type of <b>drop</b> <b>structure.</b> The vertical hard basin drop consists of a vertical [...] "cutoff wall", usually built of concrete, that is usually laid perpendicular to the stream flow; and an impact basin, not unlike a stream pool, to catch the discharged water. The purpose of the vertical hard basin drop is to force the water into a hydraulic jump (a small standing wave).

40|$|The city of Naples (Italy) is {{well known}} for its hilly landscape, along with a {{peculiar}} geology characterized by volcanic soils (i. e. tuf and pyroclastic rocks).

50|$|The Eastern Diversion {{starts at}} the Waiharakeke Stream, a {{tributary}} to the Whangaehu River, where the diversion starts. Water from here and 22 other intakes, including from the Waihianoa and Makahikato Streams, passes into the 8.4 km long underground Wahianoa Aqueduct.

50|$|Aside {{from the}} large mammals {{including}} mountain lions, coyotes, and bobcats (the last California grizzly bear in the Santa Ana Mountains was shot near Trabuco Canyon) the creek was once a productive habitat for steelhead trout.Its upper portions, which include numerous gravel beds and bars, stream pools, and cascades, are suitable habitat for the anadromous fish, which still exist as rainbow trout in upper Trabuco Creek. Because of extensive modifications—affecting the stability and water quality of the creek—steelhead no longer migrate to {{the upper reaches of}} the Trabuco Creek watershed. Conversely, steelhead were sighted in 2003 and 2005 along the creek. A project was proposed in 2005 to build a fish ladder into a concrete <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> in Trabuco Creek that blocks steelhead passage. $1.2 million was allocated by the California State Wildlife Conservation Board in 2005 to fund the project, but it has not been begun.|$|E

5000|$|The Marsh Creek {{watershed}} drains about 100 {{square miles}} of the eastern slopes of Mt. Diablo and the neighboring portions of the Black Hills. Its upper tributaries are intermittent and small perennial streams which flow northwesterly until the creek turns east at Marsh Creek Springs. The creek was dammed downstream from the Springs in the 1960s, forming Marsh Creek Reservoir. The dam is south of Brentwood and north of the intersection of Marsh Creek Road and Camino Diablo Road. Major tributaries are Briones, Dry, Deer and Sand Creeks. Briones Creek, which drains the undeveloped Briones Valley, flows into Marsh Creek at Marsh Creek Reservoir, which lies in Marsh Creek State Park (California). Dry, Deer, and Sand creeks all flow into Marsh Creek within the city limits of Brentwood. [...] The creek is largely channelized in the lower watershed, and includes a <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> {{near the city of}} Brentwood that appears to be a complete passage barrier.

50|$|However, {{there are}} {{significant}} barriers for anadromous steelhead to run up Stevens Creek to spawn. In a 1994 study, the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) found fish ladders at the Central Expressway and U.S. Route 101 often had insufficient flow and/or were clogged with debris and sediment. In addition, the <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> at L’Avenida Avenue was impassable in all five years of the study. In August, 2003 the Stevens & Permanente Creeks Watershed Council was officially formed to support stewardship of the watersheds. The SCVWD’s Fish and Aquatic Habitat Collaborative Effort (FAHCE), has recommended removal of the Denil-type fish ladders at Fremont Avenue, Evelyn Avenue, and Moffett Boulevard which tend to clog with debris and are now classified as partial barriers by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG). Adjacent to the fish ladder at Moffett Boulevard is a concrete <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> built in the 1980s which is another obstacle to salmonid passage. The existing concrete-lined channel extending further downstream to Highway 101 (a distance of 450 ft is flat and low flows cross it as a thin sheet of water over the concrete bottom. At least 6 in depth of flow is required for adequate fish passage. Although steehead continue to spawn in lower Stevens Creek, it is doubtful whether young trout can oversummer for {{one to two years}} in its drier, hotter lower reaches. In a 2004 report of factors limiting steelhead trout survival, the key recommendation was to improve access for spawning steelhead in the lower reaches of the creek (which gets very warm or even dry in summer) to the upper reaches of Stevens Creek which have perennial flows of colder water. In addition, if the Permanente Creek Diversion Channel could be modified to accommodate steelhead trout in-migration, then several miles of upper Permanente Creek, which currently holds a population of stream resident coastal rainbow trout, would be available for spawning. A NOAA/National Marine Fisheries Service report on the Stevens Creek steelhead trout population in April 2013 found a high density of spawning Redds below the Evelyn Avenue fish ladder and grade control structure, but that this barrier was forcing most of the steelhead to spawn in the undesirable lower reaches of the stream, and that it has been a significant barrier to upstream spawning runs for at least the past four years. Under the water district’s Fish and Aquatic Habitat Collaborative Effort (FAHCE), Stevens Creek has been identified as one of the prime steelhead habitats within Santa Clara County and plans are underway to remove three barriers to fish passage in the lower creek: at Moffett Boulevard, Evelyn Avenue and Fremont Avenue.|$|E
