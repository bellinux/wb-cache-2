The government reacted with three major pieces of legislation in 1574, 1579 and 1592. The kirk became a major element of the system of poor relief and justices of the peace were given responsibility for dealing with the issue. The 1574 act was modelled on the English act passed two years earlier and limited relief to the deserving poor of the old, sick and infirm, imposing draconian punishments on a long list of [...] "masterful beggars", including jugglers, palmisters and unlicensed tutors. Parish deacons, elders or other overseers were to draw up lists of deserving poor and each would be assessed. Those not belonging to the parish were to be sent back to their place of birth and might be put in the stocks or otherwise punished, probably actually increasing the level of vagrancy.

500|$|At {{the bottom}} of society were the [...] "masterless men" [...] and women (who lacked a clear social {{relationship}} with a social superior, such as service or apprenticeship) the unemployed and vagrants, whose numbers were swelled in times of economic downturn or hardship. Masterless women may have made {{up as much as}} 18 per cent of all households and particularly worried authorities. In rural society those that needed relief from extreme hardship tended from the lowest ranks of rural society, including cottars, labourers and servants. Most of those who took to the roads, around three quarters, were men. Most had a disability such as blindness, or claimed to have suffered a personal disaster such as fire or theft. Some were discharged soldiers and sailors, probably returning home or searching for work. Most tended to move around a restricted area, probably moving between a limited number of parishes in search of work and relief. For some this may have been tied to the agricultural calendar, and individuals may have moved in a circuit as different foodstuffs and work became available. Poor relief was more abundant in urban centres, particularly in the largest centres like Edinburgh. As a result, particularly <b>in</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>extreme</b> hardship the poor would gravitate to the burghs. They could form a large section of society, with roughly a quarter of population of Perth in 1584 being classified as poor. The poor in urban society were a diverse group, the largest numbers women and most of those were widows. In Aberdeen in the period 1695–1705 three-quarters of the poor who received relief were women and of those two thirds were widows. The remainder were made up of servants, casual labourers, journeymen artisans, beggars, vagrants and orphans.|$|E
500|$|In the Middle Ages Scotland {{had much}} more limited {{organisation}} for poor relief than England, lacking the religious confraternities of the major English cities. It possessed a few hospitals, bede houses and leper houses, which offered confinement rather than treatment. Because so many Scottish parishes had been impropriated for some religious foundation, {{perhaps as many as}} 87 per cent, funds were not available for local causes such as poor relief. Protestant reformers in the Book of Discipline (1560) proposed that part of the patrimony of the Catholic Church be used to support the poor, but this aim was never realised.

Poor rates were very slow to be set up in the burghs, with Edinburgh the first as a result of the outbreak of plague in 1584.

40|$|Knowledge <b>of</b> {{sea level}} <b>extremes</b> is {{important}} for coastal planning purposes. Temporal changes in the extremes may indicate changes in the forcing parameters, most probably the storm surges. Sea level extremes and their spatial and temporal variability in southern Europe are explored {{on the basis of}} 73 tide gauge records from 1940. This study uses all data available to infer risks at the coast caused by extreme sea levels. <b>Extreme</b> values <b>of</b> 250 cm are observed at the Atlantic coasts with smaller values in the Mediterranean where, {{with the exception of the}} Strait of Gibraltar and the Adriatic Sea, the extreme values are less than 60 cm. At the Adriatic Sea values of up to 200 cm are found. When the tidal contribution is removed the differences between the various areas reduce. The spatial distribution <b>of</b> the <b>extremes</b> <b>of</b> the tidal residuals is well represented by the hindcast of a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model forced by the atmospheric pressure and the wind, although the model underestimates the extremes. Higher return levels (200 – 300 cm for the 50 -year return level) are observed in the Atlantic stations due to the larger tides. In the Mediterranean, higher values are found in the northern Adriatic (between 150 and 200 cm) while in the rest of the domain they vary between 20 and 60 cm. The nonlinear interaction between tides and surges is negligible in the Mediterranean, thus the joint tides-surges distribution can be applied. The interannual and decadal variability <b>in</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>extremes</b> is caused by mean sea level changes. <br/...|$|R

Amongst a sundry of functions, the thyroid gland {{plays a key role}} in metabolism and consequently, hypothyroidism {{has been a}} common diagnosis for a decrease in performance in sled dogs. Research has indicated that a variety of environmental factors influence thyroid hormone production, of which, light exposure, climate, latitude, exercise and season demonstrate pronounced effects. Sled dogs are exposed to many of these variables and often display thyroid hormone levels that are clinically below normal ranges. Approach: This study took a cross-latitudinal naturalistic approach in determining the effects <b>of</b> day length, <b>time</b> <b>of</b> day, season, climate and exercise on thyroid hormone function in sled dogs. In the process, appropriate reference ranges for racing sled dogs were established that correlate with other studies involving working dogs. Results: There was a clear indication that thyroid hormones play an integral role in thermoregulation and are greatly affected by environmental cues. Unexpectedly, sled dogs in the sub Arctic were not more prone to hypothyroidism but in fact, had higher levels of most thyroid hormones than dogs residing at lower latitudes. Conclusion: An evolutionary adaptation may account for up-regulation <b>of</b> thyroid function <b>in</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> environmental <b>extremes.</b> Consequently, the normal range for most thyroid hormones in sled dogs is lower than clinical standards...|$|R
