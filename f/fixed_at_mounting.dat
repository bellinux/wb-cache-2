50|$|When Broken Is Easily <b>Fixed</b> was {{recorded}} <b>at</b> <b>Mount</b> Fairview and Unity Gain between January and February 2003 with producer Justin Koop.

50|$|The {{electrostatic}} pickup {{used in the}} Hohner Pianet N electric piano has a <b>fixed</b> plate <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> a 90 degree {{angle to}} the reed, while the fixed plates used in Wurlitzer electrostatic organs are parallel to the reed. The position of the fixed plate in the Pianet is such that the capacitance changes most dramatically when the reed is in the upper portion of its travel. The result is a large second-harmonic content in the resulting signal, similar to that produced by a fuzz box distortion pedal.|$|R
50|$|Like all elapids (members of {{the family}} Elapidae), Australian copperheads have hollow, <b>fixed</b> fangs <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> {{the front of the}} jaw. They are shy and {{retiring}} by nature, and prefer to escape rather than fight where escape is possible, and their venom is, by Australian standards, only moderately toxic (equal on a per-mg basis to that of the Indian cobra). Nevertheless, they deliver a substantial quantity of venom, and a copperhead bite left untreated can easily kill a healthy adult human. There is no specific copperhead antivenom; however, tiger snake antivenom is effective.|$|R

25|$|Saul's {{life and}} reign are {{described}} in the Hebrew Bible. He was anointed by the prophet Samuel and reigned from Gibeah. He fell on his sword (committing suicide) to avoid capture {{in the battle against}} the Philistines <b>at</b> <b>Mount</b> Gilboa, during which three of his sons were also killed. The succession to his throne was contested by Ish-bosheth, his only surviving son, and his son-in-law David, who eventually prevailed. A similar yet different account of Saul's life may be given in the Quran. Neither the length of Saul's reign, nor the extent of his territory are given in the Hebrew Bible; the former is traditionally <b>fixed</b> <b>at</b> twenty or twenty-two years, but there is no reliable evidence for these numbers.|$|R

50|$|After several minor attempts, in 2008 Metals X Limited, a Perth-based mining company, {{through its}} {{subsidiary}} Bluestone Mines Tasmania Pty Ltd, the operator of the Renison Bell, one of largest tin mines {{in the world}} today, decided to mine the remaining tin <b>at</b> <b>Mount</b> Bischoff to blend with ore at its Renison Bell operation. A large open cut operation taking in all the old historic workings was developed <b>at</b> <b>Mount</b> Bischoff for this purpose with the ore being trucked 80 km to the Renison Bell processing plant. At the time ore reserves <b>at</b> <b>Mount</b> Bischoff were estimated to be 845000 t grading at 1.20 percent tin. In 2009/10 198000 t of ore was mined <b>at</b> the <b>Mount</b> Bischoff open pit that produced 6267 t of tin in concentrate.

40|$|Although {{the labor}} of enslaved Africans and Black Americans played a large part {{in the history of}} colonial America, the {{presentation}} of slavery <b>at</b> George Washington’s <b>Mount</b> Vernon Estate and Gardens is, for the most part, incomplete and leaves visitors with an inaccurate impression of the reality of slavery. This research utilizes questionnaires completed by visitors on-site and field observations of various historical interpretations <b>at</b> <b>Mount</b> Vernon to answer two major research questions: (1) How is slavery portrayed <b>at</b> <b>Mount</b> Vernon? and (2) To what degree are visitors critical of the story of slavery told <b>at</b> <b>Mount</b> Vernon? The results indicated that the presentation of slavery is inconsistent and that the history of slaves <b>at</b> <b>Mount</b> Vernon is marginalized and easily avoided by most visitors. Most visitors, regardless of their racial background, are not overly critical of the presentation of slavery <b>at</b> <b>Mount</b> Vernon.

5|$|The parties {{reached a}} {{compromise}} which {{was recorded in}} the Kolozsmonostor Abbey on 6 July. They agreed that the tithe would be reduced by half.

The agreement abolished the ninth and prescribed that the peasants were only required {{to pay the rent}} to the landowners. The annual amount of the rent was <b>fixed</b> <b>at</b> 10 dinars, much lower than the rent from before the uprising. The noblemen also acknowledged the peasants' right to free movement, which could only be limited if a peasant failed to fulfill his obligations to the landowner.
