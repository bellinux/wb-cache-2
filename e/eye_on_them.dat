5|$|Savige's {{sixth and}} last {{campaign}} {{of the war}} was free of controversy about his command. Once again, he had a talented regular officer as chief of staff, Brigadier Ragnar Garrett, with whom he had worked in Greece during 1941 and more recently in New Guinea. Moreover, as a corps commander, tactical details could be left to subordinates, although Savige still had to keep a close <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> to ensure that they did not take unnecessary risks or incur needless casualties. Savige continued to tour the front lines wearing his scarlet cap band and flying his car flag. He also maintained his concern for, and rapport with, the ordinary soldiers under his command. The final campaign on Bougainville cost 516Australian lives. Some 8,500Japanese were killed while 9,800died of other causes, leaving 23,571still alive when the war ended. On 8September 1945, Savige accepted their surrender at Torokina.|$|E
5|$|Following the Irish War of Independence the Irish Free State {{was set up}} as an {{independent}} British Dominion covering most of the island of Ireland. After a brief civil war between the pro-Free State forces {{and members of the}} Irish Republican Army (IRA) who wanted any independent nation to cover the entire island the status of the Irish Free State was confirmed, and the IRA forced underground. The IRA had supporters in the United Kingdom, working openly as the Irish Self-Determination League (ISDL), and the Free State government shared the names of these supporters with the British authorities, who kept a close <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b> Between February and March they provided information on individuals that they said were part of widespread plots against the Irish Free State being prepared on British soil. On 11 March 1923 the police in Britain arrested IRA sympathisers living in Britain including Art O'Brien, the head of the ISDL. Sources disagree on numbers, giving either approximately eighty or approximately 100. The arrested men were placed on special trains and sent to Liverpool, where they were transferred to Dublin via a Royal Navy destroyer. It later transpired that not only were many British citizens (Art O'Brien himself had been born in England), at least six had never even been to Ireland before.|$|E
25|$|The story {{centers around}} three seamen who conduct shady {{business}} on board their vessel, Sandy Hook. The film starts {{with two of}} them, Tom Jansen (Helge Jordal) and Sverre (Hans Ola Sørlie), taking tourists on a polar bear safari. During this trip and at a later scene at a pub in Longyearbyen, where Tom's girlfriend, Eva Jelseth (Kjersti Holmen) is introduced, the viewers are briefed {{on the politics of}} Svalbard and the large Soviet presence. The third seaman, Lars (Sverre Anker Ousdal), presents plans to freight a bulldozer to the mainland from Sarstangen. They have been instructed to dump the bulldozer underway as part of an insurance fraud scheme, but have instead made arrangements to sell the vehicle on Greenland. While at port, Tom is called to visit Governor Bache (Jon Eikemo), who warns that he will be keeping an <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

25|$|Fremantle {{continued}} in the navy, becoming commander of the 1st Battle Squadron in May 1919. A {{large portion of the}} German fleet had by this point been interned at the Royal Navy's northern base at Scapa Flow, and Fremantle's task as commander of the First Battle Squadron was to keep a watchful <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b> The deadline for the signing of the Treaty of Versailles was by then approaching, and concerns had begun to circulate about the possibility of the disgruntled German sailors scuttling their ships, rather than agreeing to hand them over as stipulated in the terms of the treaty. Fremantle drew up orders for the ships to be seized on the expiration of the deadline for the signing of the treaty, and had them approved by his superior, Admiral Sir Charles Madden. The deadline, meanwhile, was extended from 21 June to 7pm on 23 June. Fremantle decided to take his squadron to sea to carry out exercises on 21 June, and return in the afternoon of 23 June to commence procedures for seizing the fleet. Unbeknownst to him, the German commander, Vice-Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, intended to order the scuttling of the fleet on 21 June, unaware that the deadline had been extended. As Fremantle steamed out of Scapa Flow on the morning of 21 June, Reuter was completing his preparations. The scuttling of the fleet began just before midday. When the British realised what was happening, a message was immediately despatched to Fremantle, who returned to Scapa Flow at full speed.|$|E
500|$|A link {{developed}} during the war with the King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC), whose Southern Rhodesian contingent—numbering a few hundred, chiefly in its 2nd and 3rd Battalions—was the largest on the Western Front. The connection with this particular corps began {{as the result of}} a chance conversation aboard the ship that took the first batch of Southern Rhodesians from Cape Town to Southampton in late 1914. The 16th Marquess of Winchester, who had links with Rhodesia dating back to the 1890s, was also aboard the ship, returning from a visit to the colony. Encountering Captain John Banks Brady, the officer of Irish origin who led the volunteers, the Marquess asked where his party was headed. Brady enthusiastically replied that they were going to war together in France. The Marquess suggested to Brady that since it might be difficult to prevent his men from being split up during the enlistment process, it might be a good idea for the Rhodesians to join the KRRC, where he could keep an <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> through his connections with the Winchester-based regiment. The Southern Rhodesian contingent duly mustered into the KRRC. A designated Rhodesian platoon, widely referred to thereafter as [...] "the Rhodesian Platoon", was formed under Brady at the KRRC training camp at Sheerness, on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent.|$|E
2500|$|Former R chief {{executive}} Peter Dawson had {{been critical of}} the quality of the BBC's television coverage in recent years, stating alongside its final renewal in 2010 that [...] "They know we've got our <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them.</b> You have to stay in practice and keep up with advances in technology." [...] The Guardian felt that the R was being [...] "pressured" [...] to negotiate a more lucrative broadcast deal, as the other three majors have in the United States, but also argued that viewer interest in golf could face further declines in the UK without widely available coverage.|$|E

2500|$|They soon realized, however, that Parker had the {{possibility}} of becoming quite a successful model. Soon thereafter, Parker would become the most successful model of the 1950s, helping push the Ford's agency to number one. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Fords represented top models Mary Jane Russell, Carmen Dell'Orefice, and Dovima. By 1954, the Fords were extremely successful and {{were living in a}} duplex apartment on Park Avenue. To make sure that their models were the most successful, the Fords provided hair dressers, dermatologists, and Eileen dispensed diet advice constantly. She allowed models to live with her to [...] "keep a close <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>them</b> so they'd stay out of trouble and make their early morning appointments." [...] Eleven (11) of Ford's busiest models were featured on the April 1955 issue of McCall's magazine (Parker, Leigh, Jean Patchett, Patsy Shally, Lillian Marcuson, Nan Rees, Leonie Vernet, Georgia Hamilton, Dolores Hawkins, Kathy Dennis, and Mary Jane Russell). Ford pushed for standardized hours and wages. She enforced rules about what models could and could not do (for example, showing “excessive amounts of bosom” in a photo was a no-no).|$|E
