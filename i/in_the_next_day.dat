5|$|On August 20, a {{tropical}} wave became discernible about 800miles (1300km) {{off the coast}} of Mexico, which <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> developed a large area of convection, or thunderstorms. Initially, conditions were unfavorable for development, due to strong upper-level wind shear. Tracking northwestward parallel to the Mexican coast, the system became better organized on August 22, though later that day its structure deteriorated. On August 23, a strong area of convection developed and persisted near a circulation center, despite strong wind shear. With banding features becoming more prominent, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression Eleven-E about 345miles (555km) south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} at Lukeville POE at 3 or 3:30 PM, the two agents interviewed Howard and Maureen Cotterman separately. Howard Cotterman {{offered to help}} the agents with the computer, but the offer was declined. At 6 PM, the two agents left with both laptops and one digital camera. The devices were taken to Tucson and delivered to John Owens, an ICE Computer Forensic Examiner at 11 PM that night. The camera was returned to the Cottermans as {{there was no evidence}} of contraband found. However, on April 8, Agent Owens' forensic examination turned up approximately 75 images of child pornography on Howard Cotterman's computer. Agent Owens called the Cottermans that night, asking Howard Cotterman for assistance opening the password protected files. Howard Cotterman agreed to come <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> but only his wife showed up to pick up the other laptop.|$|E

The Panyutyin division was placed on the left flank of Wohlgemuth's IV. (reserve) corps.

25|$|Görgei {{planned to}} attack <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> to advance with the III. corps towards Galánta via Vágsellye, while the II. corps protects its side by moving towards Alsószeli and Deáki. But {{already in the}} night of 20 June {{he learned that the}} enemy troops {{commanded}} by Wohlgemuth will attack, and the Panyutyin-division was also sent to help the IV. and the II. corps. So he understood that the relative balance of forces between the two armies (20,000 Hungarians with 80 cannons against 25,000 Austrians with 96 cannons) was about to be upset by the arrival of 12,000 Russians. So Görgei ordered Klapka to hold with any costs the bridge from Aszódpuszta, and József Nagysándor to force the crossing, with his troops, of the Vág river at Szered. The II. and III. corps had to wait the Austro-Russian attack and to repel it. The key of the Hungarian success was the arrival in time of the I. corps of Nagysándor, after accomplishing his initial tasks, to help the other two corps. Görgei believed that if Nagysándor's I. corps would make a successful attack, pushing the enemy back and cross the Vág river at Sempte, this would enable the counterattack of the II. and III. Hungarian corps, and the enemy instead of concentrating to capture the bridges from Aszódpuszta and Negyed to cut the retreat root of the Hungarians, will have to fight against the Hungarian attack from front, which with the help of Nagysándor's arriving troops, can threaten to encircle the main Austro-Russian troops north from Pered. So the only choice of Wohlgemuth would be the retreat, which would lead to the accomplishment of the Hungarian plans and to the victory. Görgei found also useful that his troops <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> had to fight with Russian troops too, because they could so measure the tsarists real battle value.|$|E
25|$|This defeat forced Wohlgemuth to {{lead his}} army not towards Komárom, where he planned to join the besieging Austrians, but to retreat towards Érsekújvár. Two days after the battle, on 21 April, the first Hungarian units entered in Komárom, ending the {{imperial}} blockade from the northern side of the fortress. On 24th Lieutenant General Balthasar von Simunich informed Lieutenant General Anton Csorich that the Hungarians had reconstructed the bridge across the Danube, and on it and on rafts started to cross the river. So he {{asked him to come}} with his troops at the latest in the morning of 25 April to Herkálypuszta, to help him against the Hungarian attack. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> in 26th, the Hungarian troops attacked the besieging imperial army from Komárom, which ended in the retreat of the Austrian army towards West, so the main purpose of the Spring Campaign - the liberation of the Western part of Hungary - was fulfilled.|$|E
