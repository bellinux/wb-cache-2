40|$|Fish are an {{important}} source of proteins and healthy lipids. However, they can accumulate nonpolar pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from their aquatic environment through absorption and/or adsorption. Human exposure to parent PAHs by fish consumption has not yet been determined. This study aims to assess the exposure of Malaysians to PAHs through fish ingestion and to estimate the lifetime cancer risk using the cancer risk assessment guidelines set by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and previous studies. <b>Giant</b> <b>sea</b> <b>perch</b> (barramundi) were collected from a fish farm on Langkawi Island. The mean concentration of 18 PAHs in the <b>giant</b> <b>sea</b> <b>perch</b> was 573. 66 ± 47. 56 ng g− 1 dry weight. The abundance of low-molecular-weight PAHs (63 %) was higher than that of high-molecular-weight PAHs (37 %), indicating that petrogenic inputs were higher than pyrogenic inputs. The average daily intake of the 18 PAHs through <b>giant</b> <b>sea</b> <b>perch</b> consumption was 294. 47 [ng/kg bwt/day]− 1. The lifetime cancer risks for the 18 PAHs were 1. 06 × 10 − 4, 4. 55 × 10 − 5, and 3. 69 × 10 − 6 when the frequencies of exposure were assumed as 365 days year− 1 for people who eat fish seven times a week, 156 days year− 1 for people who eat fish three times a week, and 52 days year− 1 for people who eat fish once a week, respectively. These results are within the acceptable criterion of the US EPA (10 − 6 to 10 − 4). The present study suggests that the consumption of <b>giant</b> <b>sea</b> <b>perch</b> does not pose a significant source of PAH exposure to Malaysians...|$|E
40|$|Lates calcarifer (Bloch), {{commonly}} known as <b>giant</b> <b>sea</b> <b>perch</b> or Asian seabass, is an economically important food fish in the tropical and subtropical regions in the Asia –Pacific. They are medium to large-sized bottom-living fishes occurring in coastal seas, estuaries and lagoons in depths between 10 and 50 m. They are highly esteemed food and sport fishes taken mainly by artisanal fishermen. Because of its relatively high market value, {{it has become an}} attractive commodity of both large to small-scale aquaculture enterprises. It is important as a commercial and subsistence food fish but also is a game fish. The most important commercial fish of Australia, and the most sought after game fish, generates millions of dollars per year in revenue for the sport fishing. Lates calcarifer, known as seabass in Asia and barramundi in Australia, is a euryhaline member of the family Centropomidae that is widely distributed in the Indo-West Pacific region from the Arabian Gulf to China, Taiwan Province of China, Papua New Guinea and northern Australia.

40|$|In coastal {{populations of}} {{invertebrates}} and fishes, {{the distribution of}} discrete subpopulations is influenced by adult and larval dispersal, {{as well as by}} the effects of habitat heterogeneity on site fidelity or connectivity. Here, we examine evidence for spatial structure of <b>sea</b> <b>perch,</b> Helicolenus percoides, populations among four fjords in the Fiordland region of southwestern New Zealand. We examine patterns in adult morphology, length-at-age, δ 13 C and δ 15 N of muscle tissue, and trace elemental composition of whole otoliths as proxies for population isolation among the four inner fjord regions. A multivariate analysis of morphometrics reveals significant differences among populations from each of the four sites, suggesting existence of four distinct subpopulations. These patterns are consistent with observed differences in δ 13 C and δ 15 N, and length-at-age estimates among the four subpopulations. Differences in whole otolith concentrations of Sr, Ba, Mg and Li, and high classification scores based on the whole otolith elemental fingerprint are also consistent with significant subdivision among areas. Patterns across all four markers are consistent with discrete subpopulation structure of adult <b>sea</b> <b>perch</b> among the four study sites.

40|$|We have {{identified}} an iridovirus CH- 1 from <b>sea</b> <b>perch</b> Lateolabrax sp. healthy externally and imported from China to Korea. In {{a comparison of}} the nucleotide sequences of the five different genomic regions, the CH- 1 appears to be closely related to the ISKNV, IVS- 1 and Ehime- 1 strains detected in China, Korea and Japan respectively. In quantitative comparison of the viral DNA, level of CH- 1 in tissue of imported fish was 10, 000 times lower than that of IVS- 1 strain presented in the infected rock bream Oplegnathus fascia-tus of moribund stage. It allowed us to speculate the possibility of the asymtomatic iridovirus infection in the culturing <b>sea</b> <b>perch.</b> Such possibility of asymptomatic infection was supported by result of no appear-ance of dead fish with typical symptoms of iridoviral disease in keeping experiment of the imported sea pearch in laboratory for more than three weeks.

40|$|Young of {{the year}} <b>giant</b> <b>sea</b> bass spend the first several months after planktonic {{settlement}} within recreational dive limits, where they are available for underwater study. After planktonic settlement, young {{of the year}} <b>giant</b> <b>sea</b> bass enter color phases where a pattern of black spots unique to individual fish appears distinct against a lighter background. To {{determine whether or not}} underwater photos of spot patterns might be used to identify and track individuals, several early-stage <b>giant</b> <b>sea</b> bass were captured and raised at public aquaria. Both sides of each fish were planned to be photographed monthly for a year from the capture date. The black spots of young of the year <b>giant</b> <b>sea</b> bass are so few and so distinct that computer programs developed to discern individuals of species with complicated spot patterns are not necessary for re-identification of individuals. Each of three fish that survived twelve months in captivity could be individually identified by eye using photographs of their spot patterns for a year after collection. Two other fish that expired after several months could also be individually distinguished through photographs.
