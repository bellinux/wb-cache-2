50|$|Other rift valleys are {{the result}} of bends or {{discontinuities}} in horizontally-moving (strike-slip) faults. When these bends or discontinuities are {{in the same direction as}} the relative motions along the fault, extension occurs. For example, for a right lateral-moving fault, a bend to the right will result in stretching and consequent subsidence in the area of the irregularity. In the view of many geologists today, the Dead Sea lies in a rift which results from a leftward discontinuity in the left lateral-moving Dead Sea Transform fault. Where a fault breaks into two strands, or two faults run close to each other, crustal extension may also occur between them, as a result of differences in their motions. Both types of <b>fault-caused</b> extension commonly occur on a small scale, producing such features as sag ponds or landslides.|$|E
40|$|The voltage-source-converter- (VSC-) based multiterminal VSC-HVDC power {{transmission}} system (VSC-MTDC) is an ideal approach to connect wind farm with power grid. Analyzing the characteristics of doubly fed induction generators {{as well as the}} basic principle and the control strategy of VSC-MTDC, a multiterminal DC voltage control strategy suitable for wind farm connected with VSC-MTDC is proposed. By use of PSCAD/EMTDC, the proposed control strategy is simulated, and simulation results show that using the proposed control strategy the conversion between constant power control mode and constant DC voltage control mode can be automatically implemented; thus the DC voltage stability control and reliable power output of wind farm can be ensured after the <b>fault-caused</b> outage of converter station controlled by constant DC voltage and under other faults. The simulation result shows that the model can fulfill multiterminal {{power transmission}} and fast response control...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{capturing}} the complete {{knowledge of a}} process plant, for making system is proposed. Provisions {{have been made to}} acquire the knowledge of the plant in a hybrid way, which describes the domain-specific, heuristic and the control knowledge. The domain knowledge includes structural and behavioral information about a plant. The heuristic knowledge includes hypotheses regarding fault-location and <b>fault-cause</b> about its structure, behaviour and function. The control knowledge not only contains the procedures for diagnosis, but also comprises of the information regarding the control mechanism about now to access different parts of the Knowledge Base (KB). In the proposed method, the KB for the entire plant is partitioned into a set of Functional Blocks (FBs) which reduces the problem of locating any malfunction to a manageable propotion. The method of knowledge representation is structured and hybrid. The structured organization of KB makes a diagnostic procedure easy, while the hybrid representation makes the KB general and flexible...|$|R
40|$|It {{is assumed}} that tests {{generated}} using the single stuck-at fault model will implicitly detect {{the vast majority of}} <b>fault-causing</b> defects within logic elements. This may not be the case. In this paper we characterize the possible shorts in the combinational cells in a standard cell library. The characterization includes errors on the cell outputs, errors on the cell inputs, and excessive quiescent current. The characterization provides input vectors to stimulate these errors. After characterizing the faults that occur due to possible electrical shorts, we compare the coverage of the logic faults using a single stuck-at test set and tests developed specifically to detect these shorts. We discuss the effectiveness of I DDQ testing for these faults. 1 Introduction A large percentage of the physical area of any complex CMOS logic chip is used to implement the individual logic gates; internal shorts in the logic gates may not be detected by single line stuck-at faults (SSA). The standard [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Under the {{direction}} of Dr. Mo-Yuen Chow.) Power distribution systems have been significantly affected by {{a wide range of}} <b>fault-causing</b> events; and the current outage restoration procedure may take from tens of minutes to hours. Effective outage cause identification can help to expedite the outage restoration and consequently improve the system reliability. Most current researches are based on system modeling and measurements such as voltage and current; besides, they usually target at a single feeder or a small system due to the difficulty of modeling the large-scale, nonlinear, and time-varying distribution system. In this research, various data mining approaches including statistical methods and artificial intelligence algorithms have been investigated and applied to Duke Energy distribution outage data in order to extract the outage pattern and identify the outage cause; by this means, the additional environmental information recorded in the data can be adopted in the fault diagnosis and the analysis range can be beyond the scope of a single feeder or a small system. Also, the affect of data imperfections such as data noise, data insufficiency, especially the data imbalance issue on the performance of outage cause identification have been investigated. In this work, logistic regression and artificial neural network are firstly compared on their capability in fault diagnosis; then an existing fuzzy classification algorithm is extended to E-algorithm to alleviate the effect of data imbalance; afterwards, the immune system based Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS) algorithm is investigated for its capability in fault diagnosis using real-world data; lastly, a hybrid algorithm based on E-algorithm and AIRS is proposed to embed the rule extraction capability while performing satisfactory fault cause identification...|$|R
