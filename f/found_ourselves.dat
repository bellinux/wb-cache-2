This what happened, in vain our poor fellows stood up and stretched out their arms; they could not reach far enough to bayonet these cavalrymen mounted on powerful horses, and the few shots fired in chaotic melee were just as fatal to our own men as to the English.

Although MercyMe had started as a rock band, they become associated with the adult contemporary genre after their single [...] "I Can Only Imagine" [...] became successful. In creating The Christmas Sessions, the band incorporated more elements from rock music and other genres; Millard described it as [...] "the most 'rock' album we've done" [...] and noted they did not concern themselves with the album's direction, saying [...] "we didn’t have to worry about which direction we went.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Tim Minear and [...] Vince Gilligan, and {{directed}} by Daniel Sackheim. Minear's original idea for the episode involved a convicted criminal {{who happened to be}} an atheist. While in prison, he would have heard the voice of God, commanding him to kill a truly evil man, and then he would have suddenly found himself mystically transferred out of the prison. Although the police would be after him, only Mulder would believe he was working for the greater good. Minear noted that [...] "I pitched it and I was going to do it, eventually, until we <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> at a point in the year where we needed a script really fast." [...] Executive producer Frank Spotnitz suggested to Minear that the [...] "convicted atheist" [...] should actually be Robert Modell from the third season episode [...] "Pusher".

[...] The fourth episode of the first series was controversial due to its depiction of the characters freely discussing their sex lives; in the left-wing New Statesman, Andrew Billen praised it as a homage to La Ronde and, despite the sex-talk, being [...] "intricately constructed as a farce". The right-wing tabloid Daily Mails critic wrote that the episode [...] "veered a little too close last night towards the category of 'adult entertainment', with all its connotations of sleaze and smut" [...] and [...] "we <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> immersed in their sex lives on a level of embarrassing intimacy which most people would share only with their doctor".

[...] "Some of us were miserable onstage," [...] said guitarist Joe Trohman. [...] "Others were just drunk." [...] A greatest hits compilation, Believers Never Die – Greatest Hits, followed in the fall, and following these events, the band {{decided to take a}} break.

Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later explained, [...] "There was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show {{that it was time to}} call it a day." [...] Because the show's producers felt that the show was nearing its end, many story arcs were ended in the season. The fourth episode, [...] "Millennium" [...] was written as a way to bring closure to the recently cancelled Carter-created series of the same name. The episode features Lance Henriksen reprising his role as Frank for the last time. The eleventh episode, [...] "Closure", features Mulder discovering what happened to his sister. The idea to close the story arc received mixed reactions from various production and crew members. However, many of the show's producers realized that the time had come to answer one of the show's biggest questions. Paul Rabwin noted that, [...] "It's been seven years. I don't think any of us are going to miss Samantha Mulder. That device and motivation were very strong in the early years of the show. But as the years have gone by, the speculation kind of melted away." [...] As the season progressed, however, the idea of producing another season emerged.

500|$|The writers {{felt this}} {{approach}} was similar to how Stan Lee reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with [...] "the Captain dealing {{with all sorts of}} the same things that the country [...] dealing with–Vietnam, Watergate and all that stuff–so he gets to have opinions on that", thus making the [...] "guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world that we live in." [...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we <b>found</b> <b>ourselves</b> going back to things like [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed by the Reagan Era followed by where we are today. In the comics it {{was a hell of a}} journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} discourses {{of friendship and}} belonging mobilised by girls who {{are not part of}} the dominant ‘cool’ group in one English primary school.

We argue that there are multiple dynamics in girls’ lives in which being ‘cool’ is only sometimes a dominant concern, and that there are some children for whom explicitly positioning themselves outside of the ‘cool’ group is both resistant and protective, providing a counter-discourse to the dominance of ‘coolness’. In this paper, which is based on observational and interview data in one school in the south of England, we focus on two main groupings of intermediate and lower status girls, as well as on one ‘wannabe’ ‘cool girl’. While belonging to a lower status group can bring disadvantages, for the girls we studied there were also benefits...|$|R
40|$|Computational {{neuroscience}} {{is concerned}} with answering two intertwined questions {{that are based on}} the assumption that spatio-temporal patterns of spikes form the universal language of the nervous system. First, what function does a specific neural circuitry perform in the elaboration of a behavior? Second, how do neural circuits process behaviorally-relevant information? Non-linear system analysis has proven instrumental in understanding the coding strategies of early neural processing in various sensory modalities. Yet, at higher levels of integration, it fails to help in deciphering the response of assemblies of neurons to complex naturalistic stimuli. If neural activity can be assumed to be primarily driven by the stimulus at early stages of processing, the intrinsic activity of neural circuits interacts with their high-dimensional input to transform it in a stochastic non-linear fashion at the cortical level. As a consequence, any attempt to fully understand the brain through a 2 ̆ 2 system analysis 2 ̆ 2 approach becomes illusory. However, it is increasingly advocated that neural noise plays a constructive role in neural processing, facilitating information transmission. This prompts to gain insight into the neural code by studying the stochasticity of neuronal activity, which is viewed as biologically relevant. Such an endeavor requires the design of guiding theoretical principles to assess the potential benefits of neural noise. In this context, meeting the requirements of biological relevance and computational tractability, while providing a stochastic description of neural activity, prescribes the adoption of the integrate-and-fire model. In this thesis, <b>founding</b> <b>ourselves</b> on the path-wise description of neuronal activity, we propose to further the stochastic analysis of the integrate-and fire model through a combination of numerical and theoretical techniques. To begin, we expand upon the path-wise construction of linear diffusions, which offers a natural setting to describe leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, as inhomogeneous Markov chains. Based on the theoretical analysis of the first-passage problem, we then explore the interplay between the internal neuronal noise and the statistics of injected perturbations at the single unit level, and examine its implications on the neural coding. At the population level, we also develop an exact event-driven implementation of a Markov network of perfect integrate-and-fire neurons with both time delayed instantaneous interactions and arbitrary topology. We hope our approach will provide new paradigms to understand how sensory inputs perturb neural intrinsic activity and accomplish the goal of developing a new technique for identifying relevant patterns of population activity. From a perturbative perspective, our study shows how injecting frozen noise in different flavors can help characterize internal neuronal noise, which is presumably functionally relevant to information processing. From a simulation perspective, our event-driven framework is amenable to scrutinize the stochastic behavior of simple recurrent motifs as well as temporal dynamics of large scale networks under spike-timing-dependent plasticity...|$|R

40|$|In {{the notion}} of design is hidden {{the notion of}} designer, just as inside {{the notion of the}} created world there is the notion of a creator. Designers tell stories of what they design, how they design, why they design and what it is to design. Along with their {{personal}} and existential stories, many designers offer explicit accounts of what it is to work (undertake socially significant tasks) and what it is to produce works (socially and possibly spiritually significant outcomes). These stories, from designers, offer general accounts of the uses of designing as a human project; they also offer insights into the larger possible significance of design as a social activity for an evolving society. As Ettore Sottsass asks: "And what else?". Neither I nor the others [as children] considered ourselves designers, artists, craftsmen, or engineers for the public, and even less in any way distinguished from the public: we were not looking for consumers or observers, nor did we seek any approval or disapproval beyond that we all <b>found</b> in <b>ourselves.</b> Whatever we did was rewarded by the very act of doing it, by the desire to do it; and anything that was done was, after all, part of one extraordinary sphere only: life.

Optimal stimulation was the same for both types of IgG preparations when measured after 2 h of incubation with 5 X 10 (4) cells/well and using cells maintained in a nongrowth, TSH-deficient medium for 7 days. At low IgG concentrations, the stimulatory activities of both preparations exhibited a linear dependence on concentration and similar Ka values (approximately 4 X 10 (- 8) M) despite the fact that 65 % of the Graves' serum IgG preparations had a significantly better ability to inhibit TSH binding to membrane preparations. The Ka value for TSH in the same assay was about 5 X 10 (- 12) M. Using this cell assay, 90 % of a series of hyperthyroid Graves' IgG preparations exhibited stimulating activity, a value comparable to the frequency of positive results <b>found</b> by <b>ourselves</b> and others using human thyroid cell and slice systems. In contrast, only 10 % of patients who were euthyroid 1 yr after antithyroid drug withdrawal (n = 21) exhibited stimulating activity, and no stimulating activity was detected in patients with nontoxic nodular goiter (n = 11), toxic adenoma (n = 5), or thyroid carcinoma (n = 6).

60|$|It must be {{a matter}} of pride to an English reader that this corner {{happened}} to be <b>found</b> among <b>ourselves.</b> Henry James came to London, however, more by a process of exhaustion than by deliberate choice, and plenty of chastening considerations for a Londoner will appear in his letters. If he elected to live among thick English wits rather than in any nimbler atmosphere, it was at first largely because English ways and manners lay more open to an explorer than the closer, compacter societies of the mainland. Gradually, as we know well, his affection was kindled into devoted loyalty. It remained true, none the less, that with much that is common ground among educated people of our time and place he was never really in touch. One has only to think of the part played, in the England he frequented, by school and college, by country-homes, by church and politics and professions, to understand how much of the ordinary consciousness was closed to him. Yet it is impossible to say that these limitations were imposed on him only because he was a stranger among strangers; they belonged to the conditions of his being from much further back. They were implied in his queer unanchored youth, in which he and his greatly gifted family had been able to grow in the free exercise of their talents without any of the foundations of settled life. Henry James's genius opened and flourished in the void. His ripe wisdom and culture seemed {{to have been able to}} dispense entirely with the mere training that most people require before they can feel secure in their critical outlook and sense of proportion. There could be no better proof of the fact that imagination, if only there is enough of it, will do the work of all the other faculties unaided. Whatever were the gaps in his knowledge--knowledge of life generally, and of the life of the mind in particular--his imagination covered them all. And so it was that without ever acquiring a thousand things that go to the making of a full experience and a sound taste, he yet enjoyed and possessed everything that it was in them to give.|$|R
40|$|During my 25 years {{experience}} {{working in the}} health services, I have seen numerous nursing documentation systems come and go. Some seemed well-founded and thorough, others less so. Never the less, they all vanished. Sometimes they were to cumbersome, other times the enthusiasts that kept them alive disappeared, and new enthusiasts with a different view on how nursing documentation should be done showed up. But all in all I have seen no lasting improvement in nursing documentation over these years. 2 years ago I participated in a project where we introduced the use of electronic care plans using the standardized languages NANDA and NIC. This improved documentation, and the effect is still lasting. Then, and still, I am not convinced that the cost justified the benefit.
