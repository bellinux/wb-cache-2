5|$|Winton's efforts did {{not come}} to public light until 1988, when his wife {{discovered}} papers in their loft, whereupon Winton began to publicly talk about his work, and he {{came to be known as}} the 'British Schindler', in comparison to Oskar Schindler.

5|$|When {{the group}} reached the village, Alder learned why <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> been spared. One of the Mingo chiefs, Succohanos, and his wife, Whinecheoh, were an aging couple {{who had lost}} their son, and planned to adopt Alder as a replacement. Alder was forced to run the gauntlet, as a rite of passage, and after he {{exhibited}} bravery during the trial, he was adopted and cared for by Whinecheoh. The Indian's other prisoner, Mrs. Martin, had been promised {{to a man in}} another village, and was taken away during Alder's adoption ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Evans and {{his agents}} set about aggressively {{collecting}} royalties from those using his designs. Furthermore, Evans significantly raised the license fees for {{his use of}} his patented technology, raising claims of extortion from those being asked to pay, and a great many cases ended up in court. The 1808 act had indemnified those who had adopted Evans's technologies from 1805 to 1808, but did not specify whether this indemnity was perpetual (as defendants argued) {{or whether it was}} only for the three years in question (as Evans argued). Evans by this stage of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> also established a poor reputation for himself amongst the milling community, and his abrasive and often petty pursuit of patent rights stiffened resistance. Several major legal cases questioned whether laws to extend private patents in this manner were even constitutional, but Evans ultimately prevailed in each case.|$|E

5|$|From 1992 to 1995 Reinfeldt was the {{chairman}} of the Moderate Youth League. He ousted the former chairman Ulf Kristersson at the controversial congress known as the Battle of Lycksele, securing 58 of the delegates' votes where Kristersson gained only 55. The congress was controversial because it was the culmination of a long ideological battle within the Moderate Youth League between the conservatives and the libertarians; Reinfeldt represented the conservatives and Kristersson the libertarians. Reinfeldt later stated that although the effects of that deep ideological division and battle in the party lingered on within the Moderate Youth League, he also felt that it was a defining moment in <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> <b>Had</b> he lost the battle he would most likely not be in politics today. From 1995 to 1997 he was chairman of the Democrat Youth Community of Europe.|$|E

25|$|Such work inevitably {{took its}} toll upon Father Dominic's health and from 1847 he insisted that <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> nearly run its course. He had preached {{numerous}} retreats, both alone and with Father Ignatius, both in England and Ireland. On 27 August 1849 Dominic was travelling from London to Woodchester when, at Pangbourne, he suffered a heart attack. On being taken to the Railway Tavern at Reading (later the Duke of Edinburgh Hotel, now demolished) he died after being given absolution.|$|E

25|$|Tradition {{has it that}} it was at {{the foot}} of Arthur's Seat, covered by the forest of Drumselch, that Scotland's 12th-century king David I {{encountered}} a stag while out hunting. Having fallen from his horse and about to be gored, he had a vision of a cross appearing between the animal's antlers, before it inexplicably turned away, leaving him unharmed. David, believing <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> been spared through divine intervention, founded Holyrood Abbey on the spot. The burgh arms of the Canongate display the head of the stag with the cross framed by its antlers.|$|E
25|$|A more {{organised}} form of alatrist henotheistic panentheism {{emerged in}} parallel to Hermetism. In the 1st century BC Cicero's friend Nigidius Figulus made {{an attempt to}} revive Pythagorean doctrines, an effort that was particularly successful under Apollonius of Tyana in the 1st century; within a century, supernatural powers were being ascribed to Apollonius, and accounts of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> similarities to those of Jesus. At least one major meeting place for followers of this neopythagoreanism was built in Rome itself, near Porta Maggiore, to a design similar to later Christian churches, though subterranean.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the tenth}} issue of his {{periodical}} The Moment could be published, Kierkegaard {{collapsed on the}} street. He stayed {{in the hospital for}} over a month and refused communion. At that time he regarded pastors as mere political officials, a niche in society who were clearly not representative of the divine. He said to Emil Boesen, a friend since childhood who kept a record of his conversations with Kierkegaard, that <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> been one of immense suffering, which may have seemed like vanity to others, but he did not think it so.|$|E

25|$|The {{onset of}} an {{intestinal}} illness which would plague Berlioz {{for the rest}} of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> now become apparent to him. During a visit to Baden-Baden, Edouard Bénazet commissioned a new opera from Berlioz, but due to the illness that opera was never written. Two years later, however, Berlioz instead began work on Béatrice et Bénédict, which Bénazet accepted; it was completed on 25 February 1862. As for Les Troyens, in 1860 the Théâtre Lyrique in Paris had agreed to stage it, only to reject it the following year. It was soon picked up again by the Paris Opéra.|$|E
25|$|Doherty {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} arrested for drug offences and those arising from drug use, such as {{driving under the}} influence, car theft, and driving with a suspended licence. He has pleaded guilty to possession of crack cocaine, heroin, cannabis and ketamine. His addictions have resulted in jail time and multiple trips to rehabilitation facilities. The influence of drugs on <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> already reached such an intensity at times, that in his younger days, Doherty worked as a drug dealer {{to pay for his}} drug habit, as he stated to author Peter Welsh in his biography. Doherty stated that he had been a rent boy, and that during that time he robbed one of his male clients.|$|E
25|$|Zhao Yun (died 229), {{courtesy}} name Zilong, was {{a military}} general {{who lived in the}} late Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period. Originally a subordinate of the northern warlord Gongsun Zan, Zhao Yun later came to serve another warlord, Liu Bei, and had since accompanied him on most of his military exploits, from the Battle of Changban (208) to the Hanzhong Campaign (217–219). He continued serving in the state of Shu Han – founded by Liu Bei in 221 – in the Three Kingdoms period and participated in the first of the Northern Expeditions until his death in 229. While many facts about Zhao Yun's life remain unclear due to limited information in historical sources, some aspects and activities in <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> been dramatised or exaggerated in folklore and fiction, most notably in Luo Guanzhong's historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, in which he was lauded {{as a member of the}} Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei.|$|E

25|$|Den was the {{original}} landlord of The Queen Victoria. He perhaps is best remembered for his stormy love-hate relationship with his alcoholic first wife Angie (Anita Dobson). After nearly 19 years of marriage, he finally handed divorce papers {{to her in the}} 1986 Christmas Day episode that was watched by a record-breaking 30.15 million viewers, {{more than half of the}} UK population at the time. He was also well known for his later involvement with the criminal gang known as The Firm that eventually led to an attempt on his life in 1989. For 14 years, it was believed that the Firm's attempt on <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> been successful, but he returned to Walford in September 2003. Seventeen months later, his character was killed off again, this time for good, at the hands of his manipulative second wife Chrissie (Tracy-Ann Oberman). Den's last appearance occurred one day before the 20th anniversary both the show and his character's first appearance.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{hostilities}} {{with the}} Ottomans had ceased momentarily in 1614 with the Iranian army at its acme, Abbas I sent in his troops against the Georgian kingdoms. This {{time he was}} aided by the Georgian nobleman, Giorgi Saakadze, an able fighter who had formerly enjoyed much influence {{in the service of}} Luarsab II of Kartli until a threat to <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> led him to defect to the shah. The Iranians drove both Teimuraz and Luarsab from their realms into the western Georgian kingdom of Imereti, and Abbas I replaced them with Georgian converts to Islam. Bagrat VII was installed in Kartli, while Kakheti was given to Teimuraz’s cousin Isa Khan. George III of Imereti, under the Ottoman protection, refused to give up the refugees and the shah retaliated by giving Kartli and Kakheti over to his troops for pillage. Then Luarsab chose to surrender, but rejected the shah's request to renounce Christianity. Abbas exiled him to Iran and had him strangled at Shiraz in 1622.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{increasing}} visibility through his books, LaVey {{was the subject}} of numerous articles in the news media throughout the world, including popular magazines such as Look, McCall's, Newsweek, and Time, and men's magazines. He also appeared on talk shows such as The Joe Pyne Show, Donahue and The Tonight Show, and in a feature-length documentary called Satanis in 1970. He would be credited for the mainstreaming of Satanism and witchcraft in the U.S. during the 1960s, 1970s and after. LaVey claimed that he had been appointed consultant to the film Rosemary's Baby, which revolved around a group of fictional Satanists, and that he also had a cameo appearance in the film as the Devil, however critics have argued that none of this was true. In an article published in Rolling Stone magazine in 1991, the journalist Lawrence Wright revealed that through his own investigative work, he found that many of LaVey's claims about <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>had</b> been untrue. Two official biographies have been written on LaVey, including The Devil's Avenger by Burton H. Wolfe, published in 1974 and The Secret Life of a Satanist by Blanche Barton, published in 1990.|$|E
