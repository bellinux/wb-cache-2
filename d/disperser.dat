5|$|The {{introduced}} common blackbird is, {{together with}} the native silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), the most widely distributed avian seed <b>disperser</b> in New Zealand. Introduced there along with the song thrush (Turdus philomelos) in 1862, it has spread throughout the country up to an elevation of , as well as outlying islands such as the Campbell and Kermadecs. It eats {{a wide range of}} native and exotic fruit, and makes a major contribution to the development of communities of naturalised woody weeds. These communities provide fruit more suited to non-endemic native birds and naturalised birds, than to endemic birds.|$|E
5|$|Bats play an {{important}} role in forest and cave ecology in Puerto Rico and help control mosquito populations.

5|$|The cabbage tree's year {{begins in}} autumn among the tight spike of unopened leaves {{projecting}} from {{the centre of}} each tuft of leaves. Some of the growing tips have changed from making leaves to producing inflorescences for the coming spring, and around these, two or three buds begin to produce leaves. The inflorescence and the leaf buds pass the winter protected by the enveloping spike of unopened leaves. Months later in spring or early summer, it bears its flowers {{on the outside of}} the tree, exposed to insects and birds. Flowering takes place over a period of four to six weeks, giving maximum exposure to pollinating insects. The flowers produce a sweet perfume which attracts large numbers of insects. The nectar produced by the flowers contains aromatic compounds, mainly esters and terpenes, which are particularly attractive to moths. Bees use the nectar to produce a light honey to feed their young and increase the size of the hive in the early summer. It takes about two months for the fruit to ripen, and by the end of summer a cabbage tree can have thousands of small fruits available for birds to eat and disperse. The strong framework of the inflorescence can easily bear the weight of heavy birds like the New Zealand pigeon, which was formerly the major <b>disperser</b> of the seeds. Each fruit contains three to six shiny, black seeds which are coated in a charcoal-like substance called phytomelan. The latter may serve to protect the seeds from the digestive process in the gut of a bird. The seeds are also rich in linoleic acid as a food source for the developing embryo plant, a compound which is also important in the egg-laying cycle of birds. Because it takes about two years for a particular stem to produce an inflorescence, cabbage trees tend to flower heavily in alternative years, with a bumper flowering every three to five years. Each inflorescence bears 5,000 to 10,000 flowers, so a large inflorescence may carry about 40,000 seeds, or one million seeds for the whole tree in a good flowering year—hundreds of millions for a healthy grove of trees.|$|E
25|$|In Hawaii {{the seeds}} are {{dispersed}} by frugivorous animals. By {{far the most}} important <b>disperser</b> in Hawaii is the feral pig, which eats the fallen fruit and passes the seeds intact. Feral pigs seek out the fruit and when P. tarminiana occurs with feral pigs in Hawaii, the seeds are abundant in pig droppings. Germination is not enhanced by gut passage but pigs disturb the ground making a more favourable environment for germination of P. tarminiana. Because their home range is typically one to two square miles, pigs contribute more to the peripheral expansion of P. tarminiana patches than long distance dispersal.|$|E
25|$|The diets of the {{starlings}} {{are usually}} dominated by fruits and insects. Many species are important dispersers of seeds in continents Asia and Africa, for example white sandalwood, Indian Banyan. In addition to trees {{they are also}} important dispersers of parasitic mistletoes. In South Africa, the red-winged starling is an important <b>disperser</b> of the introduced Acacia cyclops. Starlings have been observed feeding on fermenting over-ripe fruit, {{which led to the}} speculation that they might become intoxicated by the alcohol. Laboratory experiments on European starlings have found that they have disposal enzymes that allow them to break down alcohol very quickly. In addition to consuming fruits, many starlings will also consume nectar. The extent to which starlings are important pollinators is unknown, but at least some are, such as the slender-billed starling of alpine East Africa, which pollinates giant lobelias.|$|E
40|$|A large {{variety of}} food systems is treated in <b>dispersing</b> {{operations}} {{in order to}} generate a homogeneous <b>disperse</b> microstructure which allows to adjust structure-related quality characteristics of the final products. For fine <b>dispersing</b> of <b>disperse</b> structures like solid particles/biological cells, emulsion drops, gas cells and aggregates thereof, the volumetric power and energy inputs are the crucial integral processing parameters but are not sufficient in order to optimize the <b>dispersing</b> efficiency. The flow field characteristics are of additional importance. For most concentrated food systems containing a <b>disperse</b> phase, the <b>dispersing</b> flow field in any apparatus is laminar. However the ratio of shear and elongational laminar flow contributions influences the <b>dispersing</b> efficiency strongly. Beside <b>disperse</b> components most multiphase food systems contain also macromolecular stabilizing components in the continuous phase as well as surfactants at the interfaces. The various <b>disperse</b> and macromolecular components have in general different sensitivity to mechanical stresses acting in <b>dispersing</b> flows.

500|$|The species {{acts as an}} {{important}} seed <b>disperser</b> and pollinator, {{as well as a}} prey item for several carnivores.

Exudates are also obtained by gouging holes in the bark. The winter food supply consists almost entirely of plant exudates. The bastard myrobala (Terminalia belerica), a deciduous tree common in Southeast Asia, is a preferred source for exudates, but it has also been observed taking plant exudates from a number of families: Moraceae (Artocarpus), Magnoliaceae (Manglietia), Fabaceae (Acacia, Bauhinia), Lecythidaceae (Careya arborea), and Sterculiaceae (Pterospermum).

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Disperse</b> dyes {{are common}} sensitizers, {{but are not}} {{currently}} included in the European baseline series. OBJECTIVES: To justify {{the inclusion of a}} textile dye mix in the European baseline patch test series. METHODS: A survey of the reported frequencies of contact allergy to textile dyes and textile dye mixes was performed by searching PubMed ([URL] last accessed 14 December 2014). The results from a multicentre study performed within the European Environmental Contact Dermatitis Research Group (EECDRG) and published in 2014 formed the final basis for the recommendation. RESULTS: The EECDRG study performed in Europe and the United States showed that 2. 1 - 6. 9 % of consecutively tested dermatitis patients reacted to a 6. 6 % wt/wt textile dye mix consisting of eight <b>disperse</b> dyes. The clinical relevance was ascertained in > 30 % of the positive cases. A high frequency of simultaneous sensitivity to <b>Disperse</b> Orange 3 (DO 3) and p-phenylenediamine (PPD) was seen. Active sensitization to the mix was not noted. CONCLUSIONS: It is recommended to include a 6. 6 % textile dye mix consisting of eight <b>disperse</b> dyes in the European baseline series, even though one component, DO 3, may be superfluous, owing to its frequent cross-reactivity with PPD.

RESULTS: Of the above, 437 patients were allergic. The most common sensitizers were <b>Disperse</b> Blue (DB) dyes and <b>Disperse</b> Orange 3. Both the clinical aspect and the localization of the lesions were unusual in a fair percentage of cases, especially in DB-positive subjects.
