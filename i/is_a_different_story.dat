25|$|Bioarchaeology in Europe {{is not as}} {{affected}} by these repatriation issues as American bioarchaeology but regardless the ethical considerations associated with working with human remains are, and should, be considered. However, because much of European archaeology {{has been focused on}} classical roots, artifacts and art have been overemphasized and Roman and post-Roman skeletal remains were nearly completely neglected until the 1980s. Prehistoric archaeology in Europe <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story,</b> as biological remains began to be analyzed earlier than in classical archaeology.|$|E
25|$|He {{was never}} cut {{out to be}} an ODI player, never {{crossing}} 150 runs in a calendar year. He played his last ODI against the West Indies in 2006. His test career however, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story.</b> Since he made his debut in 2001, he played every year until 2010 with 2006 being the most fruitful in terms of runs scored. He made over 300 runs in 12 innings, but the team failed to win more than 2 matches(4 innings). Since then he has {{been in and out of}} the side, playing the odd match or two. He played his last game in 2010 in a losing effort against the Australians.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} Milan players {{who had played}} in the 2005 final were delighted with the victory after they lost two years previous. Kaká claimed victory was all the sweeter as a result: [...] "What {{happened}} then was strange, just six minutes when we played not so good and we paid for that." [...] Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso echoed his teammates sentiments: [...] "The defeat two years ago will stay me for a lifetime, but this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story.</b> It's our turn to celebrate now." [...] Striker Filippo Inzaghi, who missed the final in 2005, was delighted to have scored the goals that won the final for Milan: [...] "I've scored quite {{a few times in}} Europe, but scoring in the Champions League final is something special." [...] Milan President and owner Silvio Berlusconi was equally delighted about the success, adding that [...] "the fortune we lacked in Istanbul we had with us tonight." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of his retirement, Musial held or shared 17 major league records, 29 NL records, and nine All-Star Game records. Among those records, he ranked as the major league career leader in extra-base hits (1,377) and total bases (6,134). He also held NL career marks in {{categories}} such as hits (3,630), games played (3,026), doubles (725), and RBI (1,951). He finished his career with 475 home runs despite never having led the NL in the category. [...] Jerry Lansche speculates Musial would likely have become the second player, after Babe Ruth, with 2,000 RBI, and would have exceeded 500 career home runs had he not served in the military. [...] His lowest full season RBI output before the war was 72 (in 1942) and as he needed only 49 RBI to reach 2,000 for his full career, he certainly would have exceeded 2,000 RBI by playing without injury in 1945. [...] His home run production <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story</b> and it is highly unlikely he would have reached 500. [...] He did not hit more than 13 home runs in any season before he entered the navy and did not hit as many as 25 (the number he would have needed to become a 500 career homer club member) until 1948, 3 years after returning to baseball from World War II. [...] His career hit total was evenly split between 1,815 hits at home and 1,815 hits on the road. [...] Steven R. Bullock speculates that it is possible that without military service Musial might have continued playing to attempt to exceed Ty Cobb's career hit record of 4,191. [...] Even if Musial had hit safely 207 times (the average of his hits in the 2 years before and the 2 years after his service in the navy) in 1945, he still would have been 354 hits short of tying Ty. [...] His hit total in his last season at age 42 was only 86; even if he could have had 103 hits a season (the average of his last 5 seasons) {{he would have had to}} play to age 47 to attain the hits record.|$|E

Golovkin, who stated he would not attend the fight, was joined by his trainer Abel Sanchez and promoter Tom Loeffler. Golovkin joined him in the ring during the announcement to help promote their upcoming bout. Speaking through a translator, Álvarez said, [...] "Golovkin, you are next, my friend. The fight is done. I've never feared anyone, since I was 15 fighting as a professional. When I was born, fear was gone." [...] When Golovkin arrived in the ring, he said, [...] "I feel very excited. Right now <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story.</b> In September, it will be a different style -- a big drama show. I'm ready. Tonight, first congrats to Canelo and his team. Right now, I think everyone is excited for September. Canelo looked very good tonight, and 100 percent he is the biggest challenge of my career. Good luck to Canelo in September." ...|$|E

2500|$|From then on, [...] "sexiness is my brand" [...] she claimed. Thus, her {{performance}} style on stage changed {{to be more}} appropriate with dance-pop yet she claimed that her personality in her private life <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story</b> and unchanged. This new style brought many controversial opinions from the public. Some viewers objected to the innovation {{in the style of}} her music, but some had sympathy and support for her breakthrough move which has brought about a colorful style and a pioneering creative thinking in music industry. About this change, she told in the program Leo & U of the YanTV channel that this change stemmed from her changing her former conservative attitudes about her music career. She now wanted to share and bring her music closer to public tastes in order to lead them. In this genre, with seasoned experience and her powerful soprano C vocal, she is actually a pioneer in style of dance-pop music through her professional, powerful, technical, and emotional vocals and techniques. Despite being unhappy with the changes, the majority of audiences still highly value Thu Minh's career on her vocals and technical expertise.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} several {{locations}} where right whales have been observed regularly close to shore among western north Pacific in recent years, but to observe right whales purposely in commercial operations <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>story.</b> Expedition tours targeting Sea of Okhotsk, Kamchatka, and Commander islands region allows the highest possibilities to observe these whales, however, to encounter with North Pacific right whales during whale watching tours are extremely low, {{only a handful of}} operators around the world have had. One extraordinary case occurred in Japan. [...] "Nanki Marine Leisure Service", a whale-watching operator working off Kumano-nada sea had 2 different encounters of different animals in 2006, and another one in 2011. For sighting in 2011, it {{could be one of the}} most well-recorded observations ever in the history as some of aerial behaviors was observed for the first time such as keep following vessels over several hours, continuously displaying almost all-known surface behaviours of the species in a row. Several cameramen were on board both in 2006 and 2011, and Kenji Oda, a professional whale cameraman had two different encounters in 2006 and later. Bonin islands is the location with second-highest sighting rates during commercial tours, followed by Izu Islands.|$|E
