500|$|The MiG-1 was a low-wing {{monoplane}} with a tailwheel undercarriage {{of mixed}} construction. Due to shortages of light alloys, the rear fuselage {{was made from}} wood, but the front fuselage, from the propeller {{to the rear of}} the cockpit, was a welded steel tube truss covered by duralumin. The bulk of the wing was wooden, but the center section was all-metal with a steel I-section main spar. The wing used a Clark YH profile. It was evenly tapered with rounded tips and the outer wing panels had 5° of dihedral. All three landing gear wheels retracted hydraulically; the main units inwards into the wing center section. The cockpit was situated well aft, which seriously limited forward vision when landing and taxiing. The AM-37 engine was not yet available and the less powerful V-12 Mikulin AM-35A had to be substituted. It had six exhaust <b>ejectors,</b> one for each pair of cylinders, that provided some additional thrust. It drove a VISh-22Ye controllable-pitch propeller [...] in diameter.

40|$|The {{application}} of an <b>ejector</b> nozzle integrated with a reaction drive rotor configuration for a vertical takeoff and landing rotorcraft is considered in this research. The <b>ejector</b> nozzle is {{a device that}} imparts energy from a high speed airflow source to a lower speed secondary airflow inside a duct. The overall nozzle exhaust mass flow rate is increased through fluid entrainment, while the exhaust gas velocity is simultaneously decreased. The exhaust gas velocity is strongly correlated to the jet noise produced by the nozzle, making the <b>ejector</b> {{a good candidate for}} propulsion system noise reduction. <b>Ejector</b> nozzles are mechanically simple in that there are no moving parts. However, coupled fluid dynamic processes are involved, complicating analysis and design. Geometric definitions of the <b>ejector</b> nozzle are determined through a reduced fidelity, multi-disciplinary, representation of the rotary wing <b>ejector.</b> The resulting rotary wing <b>ejector</b> geometric sizing procedure relates standard vehicle and rotor design parameters to the <b>ejector.</b> Additionally, a rotary wing <b>ejector</b> performance procedure is developed to compare this rotor configuration to a conventional rotor. Performance characteristics and aerodynamic effects of the rotor and <b>ejector</b> nozzle are analytically studied. <b>Ejector</b> nozzle performance, in terms of exit velocities, is compared to the primary reaction drive nozzle; giving an indication of the potential for noise reduction. Computational fluid dynamics are paramount in predicting the aerodynamic effects of the <b>ejector</b> nozzle located at the rotor blade tip. Two-dimensional, steady-state, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models are implemented for sectional lift and drag predictions required for the rotor aerodynamic model associated with both the rotary wing <b>ejector</b> sizing and performance procedures. A three-dimensional, unsteady, RANS simulation of the rotary wing <b>ejector</b> is performed to study the aerodynamic interactions between the <b>ejector</b> nozzle and rotor. Overall performance comparisons are made between the two- and three-dimensional models of the rotary wing <b>ejector,</b> and a similar conventional rotor. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Daniel P.

2500|$|Cromwell's second {{objective}} was spiritual and moral reform. He aimed to restore liberty {{of conscience and}} promote both outward and inward godliness throughout England. During {{the early months of}} the Protectorate, a set of [...] "triers" [...] was established to assess the suitability of future parish ministers, and a related set of [...] "ejectors" [...] was set up to dismiss ministers and schoolmasters who were deemed unsuitable for office. The triers and the <b>ejectors</b> were intended to be at the vanguard of Cromwell's reform of parish worship. This second objective is also the context in which to see the constitutional experiment of the Major Generals that followed the dissolution of the first Protectorate Parliament. After a royalist uprising in March 1655, led by Sir John Penruddock, Cromwell (influenced by Lambert) divided England into military districts ruled by Army Major Generals who answered only to him. The 15 major generals and deputy major generals—called [...] "godly governors"—were central not only to national security, but Cromwell's crusade to reform the nation's morals. The generals not only supervised militia forces and security commissions, but collected taxes and ensured support for the government in the English and Welsh provinces. Commissioners for securing the peace of the commonwealth were appointed to work with them in every county. While a few of these commissioners were career politicians, most were zealous puritans who welcomed the major-generals with open arms and embraced their work with enthusiasm. However, the major-generals lasted less than a year. Many feared they threatened their reform efforts and authority. Their position was further harmed by a tax proposal by Major General John Desborough to provide financial backing for their work, which the second Protectorate parliament—instated in September 1656—voted down for fear of a permanent military state. Ultimately, however, Cromwell's failure to support his men, sacrificing them to his opponents, caused their demise. Their activities between November 1655 and September 1656 had, however, reopened the wounds of the 1640s and deepened antipathies to the regime.|$|E
