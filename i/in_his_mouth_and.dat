5|$|The {{release of}} Barbarella and Danger: Diabolik {{led to a}} minor trend of film adaptations of comic strips that {{emphasized}} mild sadomasochism and late 1960s fetish gear. Diabolik {{was the first of}} three European comic strip adaptations released in 1968, the other two being Piero Vivarelli's Satanik and Roger Vadim's Barbarella. These films were followed by Bruno Corbucci's Ms. Stiletto and Corrado Farina's Baba Yaga (1973). The look of Diabolik influenced the comic series. The film's audiences could see Diabolik's mouth because Law's mask was made of latex. This resulted in the comic's artists Enzo Facciolo and Sergio Zaniboni giving up on trying to shade <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> simply outlining it.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Gregory Banks, {{a convicted}} felon, filed {{a civil suit}} for $16 million in damages against Burge, three colleagues, and the City of Chicago for condoning {{brutality}} and torture. He {{said that he had}} falsely confessed in 1983 to murder after he was tortured by officers: they placed a plastic bag over his head, put a gun <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> performed other acts. He said that the officers allegedly abused eleven other suspects, using such measures as electro-shock. The suit was brought by the People's Law Office attorneys who had represented Andrew Wilson in the 1989 police brutality case. The suit described 23 incidents against black and Hispanic suspects between 19721985. The Bank's suit named Sergeant Peter Dignan as one of the officers involved in the abuses. In 1995 Dignan was promoted for meritorious service, even though the City of Chicago had settled out of court with Banks on his suit.|$|E

25|$|The {{shooting}} {{inside the}} house lasted for five minutes. A patrol officer nearby, Steve Leonard, heard the shots {{and headed to the}} scene, getting the address from multiple 911 dispatches. When he got to the house, he encountered an injured victim and immediately got between the victim and the house, as Huff was coming down the steps. Before the officer could complete his demand that Huff drop his weapon, Huff placed the gun <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> shot himself through the head.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, {{deprived}} of morphine for some days, he borrowed a shotgun on {{the pretext of}} killing a snake and {{shot himself in the}} chest. The wound was not fatal, and Marais therefore put the gun barrel <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> pulled the trigger. He did so on the farm Pelindaba, belonging to his friend Gustav Preller. For those who are familiar with the dark moods of certain of Marais' poems, there is a black irony here; in Zulu, Pelindaba means 'the end of the business' – although the more common interpretation is 'Place of great gatherings'.|$|E
25|$|The Alienist {{is a crime}} {{novel by}} Caleb Carr first {{published}} in 1994 and is the first book in the Kreizler series. It takes place in New York City in 1896, and includes appearances by many famous figures of New York society in that era, including Theodore Roosevelt and J. P. Morgan. The sequel to the novel is The Angel of Darkness. The story follows Roosevelt, then New York City police commissioner, and Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, as their investigative team attempts to solve gruesome murders through new methods including fingerprinting and psychology. The first murder victim investigated is a 13-year-old immigrant who has had his eyes removed, his genitals removed and stuffed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> other injuries. The investigators deal with various interest groups that wish {{to maintain the status}} quo regarding the poor immigrant population in New York City.|$|E

25|$|On 8 March 2000, 19-year-old {{secondary}} school student Ebrima Barry {{was murdered by}} firefighters in Brikama, West Coast Division. Barry's teacher, a Mr Paul, had called firefighters to the school after Barry had insulted him, in order to remove Barry from the classroom, as {{he was afraid of}} a physical altercation. However, the firefighters not only removed him from the school but took him to their station where they shaved his head, beat him, forced him to carry heavy bags of cement, stripped him naked, poured cement on him and finally put cement <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> forced him to swallow it. He was able to get home that night but died the next day from his injuries.

25|$|God's {{word came}} to Jeremiah {{to say that}} before God formed him in the womb, God knew him, sanctified him, and {{appointed}} him a prophet to the nations. Jeremiah protested {{that he could not}} speak, for he was a child, but God told him not to fear, for he would go wherever God would send him, say whatever God would command him to say, and God would be with him to deliver him. Then God touched Jeremiah's mouth and said that God had put words <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> set him over the nations to root out and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant. God asked Jeremiah what he saw, he replied that he saw the rod of an almond tree, and God said that he had seen well, for God watches over God's word to perform it.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears from}} {{the imagery of}} the Swedish runestones that the most popular Norse legend in the area was that of Sigurd the dragon slayer. He is {{depicted}} on several runestones, but {{the most famous of}} them is the Ramsund inscription. The inscription itself is of a common kind that tells of the building of a bridge, but the ornamentation shows Sigurd sitting in a pit thrusting his sword, forged by Regin, through the body of the dragon, which also forms the runic band in which the runes are engraved. In the left part of the inscription lies Regin, who is beheaded with all his smithying tools around him. To the right of Regin, Sigurd is sitting and he has just burnt his thumb on the dragon's heart that he is roasting. He is putting the thumb <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> begins to understand the language of the marsh-tits that are sitting in the tree. They warn him of Regin's schemes. Sigurd's horse Grani is also shown tethered to the tree.|$|E

In Parallel Lives Plutarch states that Demosthenes built an underground study where he practiced speaking and shaving one half of his head so that he could not go out in public. Plutarch also states that he had “an inarticulate and stammering pronunciation” that he got rid of by speaking with pebbles <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> by repeating verses when running or out of breath.

500|$|With {{the help}} of Kirstie McLellan Day, Fleury wrote his autobiography, Playing with Fire, which was {{released}} on October 16, 2009. In it, he alleged that he was sexually abused by Graham James {{over a period of}} two years. While he stated he [...] "doesn't want to become the poster boy for abuse by James", Fleury hoped that speaking out might make it easier for other childhood sexual abuse victims to come forward. He blamed the abuse for turning him into a [...] "raging, alcoholic lunatic", and claimed to have placed a loaded gun <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> contemplated suicide in 2004. He revealed that he had spent most of his income on alcohol, drugs, gambling and women. Fleury also claimed that he failed 13 consecutive drug tests while playing for the Rangers, but that the league did not want to suspend him because he was a leading scorer. The league disputed this, and stated that its substance abuse program functioned appropriately.|$|E
500|$|At 3:20p.m., the {{screwdriver}} {{slipped and}} the upper beryllium hemisphere fell, causing a [...] "prompt critical" [...] reaction and a burst of hard radiation.

500|$|Rupert was {{accordingly}} {{a prominent}} figure in Parliamentary propaganda. He faced numerous accusations of witchcraft, either personally or by proxy through his pet dog. Boy, sometimes called Pudel; {{a large white}} hunting poodle, accompanied Rupert everywhere from 1642 up until the dog's death at Marston Moor and was widely suspected of being a witch's familiar. There were numerous accounts of Boy's abilities; some suggested {{that he was the}} Devil in disguise, come to help Rupert. Pro-Royalist publications ultimately produced parodies of these, including one which listed Rupert's dog as being a [...] "Lapland Lady" [...] transformed into a white dog; Boy was able, apparently, to find hidden treasure, possessed invulnerability to attack, could catch bullets fired at Rupert <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> could prophesy as well as the 16th century soothsayer, Mother Shipton. Similar stories from the period relate to Rupert's pet monkey. [...] Like his dog, the monkey was featured in newsprint of the day and was also reputed to have shape shifting powers, being able to disguise itself behind enemy lines.|$|E
500|$|Handed {{complete}} {{managerial control}} following Mudie's resignation in May 1967, Matthews couldn't guide {{the club to}} success – instead, Port Vale were fined £4,000 in February/March 1968 and expelled from the Football League for financial irregularities. He was forced to use his name to plead with the other Football League clubs to re-elect the Vale, which they duly did. He stood down as manager in May 1968, and despite being owed £9,000 in salary and expenses, agreed to stay at Vale Park to continue his work with the youth team. A [...] "final settlement" [...] was reached in December 1970, Matthews was given £3,300, with the other £7,000 he was owed to be written off. Player Roy Sproson later said that [...] "he [...] trusted people who {{should never have been}} trusted and people took advantage of him. I am convinced a lot of people sponged off him and, all the while, the club were sliding." [...] The experience [...] "left a sour taste" [...] <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> was enough to convince him never to try his hand as management in English football again.|$|E

2500|$|In Hebrew, {{the word}} נָבִיא (nāvî), [...] "spokesperson", {{traditionally}} translates as [...] "prophet".

The meaning of navi is perhaps described in Deuteronomy 18:18, where God said, [...] "...and I will put My words <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him." [...] Thus, the navi was thought to be the [...] "mouth" [...] of God.

2500|$|According to Nihongi, {{during the}} reign of Emperor Sushun-Tennō, a warrior named Yorozu of the Tottori-be (...) , vassal of Mononobe no Moriya no Ōmuraji and {{commander}} of hundred soldiers, was suspected of plotting a rebellion against the Soga clan, who happened to just kill the man. Yorozu fled alone to hide in the countryside, but he was pursued by Imperial Court soldiers. He escaped them with great ingenuity until he got shot in the knee by an arrow. Though he claimed being innocent, loyal to the Emperor and ready to surrender, the soldiers still came for the kill. Despite his injury, Yorozu deflected their arrows (Yadomejutsu), and proceeded on cutting down more than 30 of them with his sword. Probably exhausted by this martial prowess, Yorozu destroyed his bow, threw his sword into a river (in a similar fashion as the knight Roland le Preux) and finally stabbed himself in the throat with a dagger (this way of committing suicide was quite common in China at the time of Spring and Autumn period). The local governor of Kawachi received the order to cut Yorozu's corpse to pieces and expose it in order to make an example, but the white dog of Yorozu fled with his head <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> brought it upon an ancient burial mound. Yorozu's dog then laid down close by and starved to death while mourning his master. The Imperial Court was moved by the dog's loyalty : ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{fulfilment}} of {{the promise}} of peaceful life, symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head (Leviticus Rabbah x., Midrash Teh. cxxxiii. 1), Aaron's death, {{as described in the}} Haggadah, was of a wonderful tranquility. Accompanied by Moses, his brother, and by Eleazar, his son, Aaron went to the summit of Mount Hor, where the rock suddenly opened before him and a beautiful cave lit by a lamp presented itself to his view. [...] "Take off thy priestly raiment and place it upon thy son Eleazar!" [...] said Moses; [...] "and then follow me." [...] Aaron did as commanded; and they entered the cave, where was prepared a bed around which angels stood. [...] "Go lie down upon thy bed, my brother," [...] Moses continued; and Aaron obeyed without a murmur. Then his soul departed as if by a kiss from God. The cave closed behind Moses as he left; and he went down the hill with Eleazar, with garments rent, and crying: [...] "Alas, Aaron, my brother! thou, the pillar of supplication of Israel!" [...] When the Israelites cried in bewilderment, [...] "Where is Aaron?" [...] angels were seen carrying Aaron's bier through the air. A voice was then heard saying: [...] "The law of truth was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> iniquity was not found on his lips: he walked with me in righteousness, and brought many back from sin" [...] (Malachi 2:6). He died, according to Seder Olam Rabbah ix., R. H. 2, 3a, on the first of Ab." [...] The pillar of cloud which proceeded in front of Israel's camp disappeared at Aaron's death (see Seder 'Olam, ix. and R. H. 2b-3a). The seeming contradiction between Numbers 20:22 et seq. and Deuteronomy 10:6 is solved by the rabbis in the following manner: Aaron's death on Mount Hor was marked by the defeat of the people in a war with the king of Arad, in consequence of which the Israelites fled, marching seven stations backward to Mosera, where they performed the rites of mourning for Aaron; wherefore it is said: [...] "There [...] died Aaron." ...|$|E
