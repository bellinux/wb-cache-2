The presented methodology allows {{to include in the}} analysis wind-based generation at all scales of implementation, starting from highly dispersed micro and small-scale units connected at LV, to medium-size wind parks connected at MV, to large-scale wind farms connected at HV. An advanced model of wind energy resources is applied to generate realistic input wind data at all scales of implementation, while newly developed and improved aggregate models are used for the correct representation of micro/small wind generation connected in parallel with <b>demand-responsive</b> <b>system</b> loads. The proposed methodology is specifically intended for the analysis of planning and operation of transmission systems. The approach is illustrated using a case study of an actual section of transmission network, where available measurements at wind parks and other sites are used for the validation of obtained results...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop a method of objectively comparing and optimizing the performance of demand-responsive transportation systems in heterogeneous environments. Demand-responsive transportation refers to modes of transportation that do not follow fixed routes or schedules, including taxis, paratransit, deviated-route services, ride sharing as well as other modes. Heterogeneous environments are transportation environments in which streets do not follow regular patterns, passenger behavior is difficult to model, and transit schedules and layouts are non-uniform. An example of a typical heterogeneous environment is a modern suburb with non-linear streets, low pedestrian activity, and infrequent or sparse transit service. The motivation for {{this research}} is to determine if demand-responsive transportation can be used to improve customer satisfaction and reduce operating costs in suburban and low-density urban areas where fixed-route transportation may be inefficient. This research extends existing comparison and optimization techniques that are designed to work in homogeneous environments. Homogeneous environments refer to transportation systems where the streets follow regular and repeating patterns, passengers are evenly distributed throughout the system, and the transit system is easily modeled. The performance of systems with these characteristics can be approximated with closed-form analytical expressions representing passenger travel times, vehicle distances traveled, and other performance indicators. However, in the low-density urban areas studied in this research, the street patterns and transit schedules are irregular and passenger behavior is difficult to model. In these areas, analytical solutions cannot be found. Instead, this research develops a simulation-based approach to compare and optimize performance in these heterogeneous environments. Using widely-available route-planning tools, open-source transit schedules, and detailed passenger data, it is possible to simulate the behavior of transit vehicles and passengers to such an exacting degree that analytical solutions are not needed. A major technical contribution {{of this research is}} the development of a demand-responsive transportation simulator to analyze performance of demand-responsive systems in heterogeneous environments. The simulator combines several open-source tools for route planning with a custom-built demand-responsive vehicle and passenger-itinerary optimizer to simulate individual vehicles and passengers within a large system. With knowledge of the street network, the transit schedule, passenger locations, and trip request times, the simulator will output exact passenger transit times, passenger travel distances, vehicle travel distance, and other performance indicators for a particular transportation setup in a given area. The simulator is used to develop a method of comparing various demand-responsive and fixed-route systems. By predefining a set of performance indicators, such as passenger travel time and operating cost, the simulator can be used to ascertain the performance of a wide array of transportation systems. Comparing the weighted cost of each type of system permits a transportation engineer or planner to determine what type of system will provide the best results in a given area. The simulator is extended to assist in optimization of the demand-responsive transportation system layout. A key problem that needs to be solved when implementing a <b>demand-responsive</b> <b>system</b> is to determine the size, shape, and location of the demand-responsive coverage areas, i. e., the areas in which passengers are eligible for demand-responsive transportation. Using a particle swarm optimization algorithm and the simulation-based comparison technique, the optimal size and shape for a demand-responsive coverage area can be determined. The efficacy of the comparison and optimization techniques is demonstrated within the city of Atlanta, GA. It is shown that for certain areas of the city of Atlanta, demand-responsive transportation is more efficient than the currently implemented fixed-route system. Depending on the objective of the transportation planner, passenger satisfaction as well as operating costs can be improved by implementing a <b>demand-responsive</b> <b>system</b> in certain low-density areas. The techniques introduced in this research, and the simulation tool developed to implement those techniques, provide a repeatable, accurate, and objective method with which to optimize and compare demand-responsive transportation systems in heterogeneous environments.

To do this they must have education and training that equips them for the labor market. One of the sources of the skilled workforce is the vocational education and training system. However, the government realizes that the system is not being able to appropriately respond to the needs of the labor market. A key issue, then, is what reforms/interventions are needed to improve the effectiveness of the system. Answering that question is far from easy and this paper attempts to provide some options for doing so. On the one hand India faces the future with its changing realities; on the other hand it must deal with the nature of its established traditions and structures. This paper has laid out some key reforms that must be undertaken in different areas to make the vocational education and vocational training systems more responsive to the needs of the labor market. The reform agenda is fairly comprehensive and all the reforms cannot be implemented immediately. Given this, the paper has laid out some of the critical reforms that need to be undertaken in the short-run (first phase) followed by others that can be undertaken over a period of 2 - 3 years. The first phase focuses on reforms aimed at improving the quality and labor market relevance of the existing system, while the medium-term agenda also includes moving forward on mobilizing additional resources for the system, especially once the quality has improved. However the background work needed to undertake reforms in the medium-term should also commence immediately. These reforms should be treated as a package. If only some are instituted, while others are not, it is unlikely that the objective of developing a truly <b>demand-responsive</b> <b>system</b> will be effectively met...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Data-oriented {{coordination}} languages rely on {{a shared}} space in which agents add, read and retrieve data. They are intuitively well suited for distributed transportation applications, where different actors evolve in a highly dynamic and very constrained environment. However, existing coordination languages can hardly be used for transportation ap-plications, because they cannot express agents complex interaction needs. Indeed, in transportation applications, the interaction needs of the agents are driven by their current context and by ambient conditions, expressed {{in the form of}} constraints on the values taken by variables. In this paper, we propose Lacios, a new data-oriented coordination language for de-signing and implementing distributed transportation applications, and we illustrate our proposal with two examples: a traveler information sys-tem and a <b>demand-responsive</b> transport <b>system.</b> Lacios allows agents to express complex interaction needs, including agents states, system ob-jects values, operators and functions, and is grounded on a model where the multi-agent system design is centered on the environment. ...|$|R

Such a system could provide services to the traveling public for journeys to work and to non-work destinations. Results from six focus group meetings and a computer-assisted telephone survey of commuters and non-commuters are reported. While about 60 % of those surveyed were willing to consider PDRT as an option, about 12 % reported that they were "very likely" to use PDRT (N= 1000). Many were willing to pay for the service and valued highly the flexibility in scheduling the service.

40|$|AbstractIn {{light of}} the need to make better use of {{existing}} transport infrastructure, <b>demand-responsive</b> transportation (DRT) <b>systems</b> are gaining traction internationally. However, many systems fail due to poor implementation, planning, and marketing. Being able to realistically simulate a system to evaluate its viability before implementation is important. This review investigates the application of agent-based simulation for studying DRT. We identify that existing simulations are strongly focused on the optimisation of trips, usually in favour of the operator, and rarely consider individual preferences and needs. Agent-based simulations, however, permit incorporation of the latter, as well as capture the interactions between operators and customers.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} Ph. D. Thesis is the design, {{development}} and testing of a 'well-engineered system' aimed at the demand-responsive traffic control of urban areas. Because of the author's background -software engineering-, a 'well-engineered system' means {{a system that is}} both efficient at performing its task {{in a wide range of}} conditions and also that has been built from the robust design's and ease-of-use's points of view. The work has proceed in four steps and, accordingly, this document has been divided in four parts that are briefly desc 1 ibed here. PART I is, mainly, an introduction to the subject. It introduces the concept of demand­ responsiveness in traffic control, providing a historical perspective from traditional fixed­ control systems to current modern <b>demand-responsive</b> <b>systems.</b> The part concludes with a study of areas where research and improvement is needed. All of these areas are considered in the following parts, where some solutions are proposed. PAR T II presents the design, {{development and}} preliminary tests of a demand­ responsive traffic control system, CARS V l, intended to operate in signalized urban areas: networks, arte 1 ials, and isolated intersections. A graphical user interface, X-Windows and DecWindows compliant, allows the user to specify network characteristics in a friendly and intuitive manner, without the need to be acquainted with the actual modeling. The system features an underlying simulation system and a prediction model based on real-time measured conditions, implements a centralized approach based on small variations, and has flexible detector positioning-and-number requirements. PART III presents the design of a simulation environment, named GETRAM, that solves the difficulties in testing CARS that were discussed at the end of the previous part. We have seen that these difficulties are inherent in the traffic engineer having to use diverse models in order to analyze a traffic network, and that there is the need for a system to salve it. GETRAM provides a unified framework integrating various types of traffic models and tools for traffic analysis, sharing a DataBase, a graphical editor and a mod le for results presentation. The traffic network can be partitioned into views, hierarchically organized polygons in the real world, so that, for example, a simulation model applies only to one of these restricted areas. Network statcs produced by one model can be used as a starting point by another modcl. I n order to ease the task of integrating a new model or analysis tool, a library of object-based high-level functions provide a view-aware access to the DataBase, maintaining consistency. Included in this Ph. D. thesis are the design of the whole environment -DataBase, G ETR AM API, and graphical editor - and the development of the DataBase and GETRAM API. PART IV starts from the <b>demand-responsive</b> traffic control <b>system</b> developed in PART II, CARS V l, and improves it in various respects. First, in order to ease the task of testing the system, it is integrated into the traffic modeling and analysis environment described in PART III. Second, certain parts that directly influence to the effectiveness of the system, such as control timing, adaptive control logics and communication with the controllers, are revised or totally redone. A suite of tests has been applied to the resulting system, CARS V 2, in the four scenarios desc 1 ibed in PART 11. Finally, to further testing the system and taking advantage of the fact of having real-world data available, it is compared against a vehicle-actuated control at an isolated junction. El objetivo de esta tesis es el diseño, desarrollo y test por simulación microscópica de un sistema autoadaptativo apto para cruces aislados, arterias y redes urbanas complejas. El sistema produce planes de control acíclicos y presenta unos requerimientos de tiempo real muy flexibles debidos a utilizar una nueva secuencia cíclica de tareas en la que se predice el estado del sistema a corto término antes de probar planes de control alternativos. Estas pruebas se realizan mediante un modelo interno de simulación que sigue un enfoque mesoscópico a base de paquetes de vehículos de velocidad variable, con el que se consigue modelizar la dinámica de colas de vehículos de forma más exacta que con los sistemas actualmente existentes. Esto da una ventaja, corroborada en los test, en condiciones de flujo altas, con lo que el sistema de controles es capaz de mantener una buena efectividad en un amplio rango de condiciones de tráfico. El sistema viene acompañado de un entorno de simulación y test que aporta un alto grado de integración y de facilidad de uso, a lo largo de todo el proceso de especificación de geometría, parámetros y ejecución de simulación se mantiene una vista de la red de tráfico altamente realista.

40|$|While {{conventional}} shared <b>demand-responsive</b> transportation (SDRT) <b>systems</b> mostly {{operate on}} a door-to-door policy, the usage of meeting points for the pick-up and drop-off of user groups can offer several advantages, like fewer stops and less total travelled mileage. Moreover, it offers the possibility to select only feasible and well-defined locations where a safe (de-) boarding is possible. This paper presents a three-step workflow for solving the SDRT problem with meeting points (SDRT-MP). Firstly, the customers are clustered into similar groups, then meeting (and divergence) points are determined for each cluster. Finally, a parallel neighbourhood search algorithm is applied to create the vehicle routes. Further, a simulation with realistic pick-up and drop-off locations based on map data is performed in order to demonstrate the impact of using meeting points for SDRT systems {{in contrast to the}} door-to-door service. Although the average passenger travel time is higher due to enhanced walking and waiting times, the experiment highlights a reduction of operator resources required to serve all customers.

40|$|<b>Demand-responsive</b> {{transport}} (DRT) <b>systems,</b> where users generate {{requests for}} transportation from a pickup {{point to a}} delivery point, are expected to increase in usage dramatically as the inconvenience of privately-owned cars in metropolitan areas becomes excessive. However, despite the increasing role of DRT systems, {{there are very few}} rigorous results characterizing achievable performance (in terms, e. g., of stability conditions). In this paper, our aim is to bridge this gap for a rather general model of DRT systems, which {{takes the form of a}} generalized Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem. The key strategy is to develop analytical bounds for the optimal cost of the Euclidean Stacker Crane Problem (ESCP), which represents a general static model for DRT systems. By leveraging such bounds, we characterize a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of DRT systems; the condition depends only on the workspace geometry, the stochastic distributions of pickup and delivery points, customers' arrival rate, and the number of vehicles. Our results exhibit some surprising features that are absent in traditional spatially-distributed queueing systems.

40|$|The {{environmental}} consequences of transportation are significant; and, vehicular sources account for onequarter {{to more than}} one-half of all nationwide emissions of pollutants including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and organic substances and carcinogens such as benzene, 1, 3 -butadiene, formaldehyde, toluene, xylene, and others. However, it is spurious to conclude that vehicular (primarily tailpipe) emissions are the only, or only significant, environmental consequence of transportation. And, to identify and assess these other consequences, the use of life-cycle analysis (LCA) methods is recommended. For example, when transportation is examined on this basis, significant {{environmental consequences}} are identified in other lifecycle stages including vehicle production and the extraction, production, and distribution of fuel. And, because of these life-cycle consequences, {{it is clear that}} “simple” solutions such as cleaner fuels and electric vehicles are inadequate to mitigate the environmental impacts of vehicular travel. There has been only limited research to-date that has modeled and optimized the operation of a transportation network or system where environmental impacts were considered among the optimization objectives. And, previous research has been limited primarily to consideration of criteria pollutants (tailpipe emissions) and/or to optimization of a single variable. More importantly, from the perspectives of decision theory and environmental sustainability, it is not the impacts (e. g., pollutant emissions) that should be optimized; but, rather, it is the consequences of the impacts (e. g., human health and ecological damage) that are important and should {{serve as the basis for}} optimization. And, available life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methodologies provide a means for identifying and assessing such consequences. This paper will develop and demonstrate a methodology for optimizing the operation (vehicle assignment, routing, and scheduling) of a public transit (<b>demand-responsive,</b> paratransit) <b>system</b> based on the joint optimization of cost, service, and environmental (consequence) objectives.

40|$|AbstractFixed daily trips such as {{trips to}} work/school have fixed departure/arrival times and {{destination}} points. The recurrent nature of fixed activities facilitates individuals on making more well-informed {{decisions about the}} transport mode selection. On the contrary, selecting a transportation mode for non-recurrent leisure trips, which can account for up to 60 % of trips in some cities (Transport for London, 2014), is a more complex task {{due to the fact}} that individuals have little knowledge about the alternative modal options. In this paper, we try to improve the operations of <b>demand-responsive</b> public transportation <b>systems</b> by increasing their service quality and their ridership related to joint-leisure-trips via timetable rescheduling.

In addition, traffic creates major health, environmental, and economical problems. Nonetheless, automobiles are crucial for {{the functions of the}} modern society. Most proposals for sustainable traffic solutions face major political opposition, economical consequences, or technical problems. Methods We performed a decision analysis in a poorly studied area, trip aggregation, and studied decisions from the perspective of two different stakeholders, the passenger and society. We modelled the impact and potential of composite traffic, a hypothetical large-scale <b>demand-responsive</b> public transport <b>system</b> for the Helsinki metropolitan area, where a centralised system would collect the information on all trip demands online, would merge the trips with the same origin and destination into public vehicles with eight or four seats, and then would transmit the trip instructions to the passengers' mobile phones.

40|$|The Stacker Crane Problem is NP-Hard and {{the best}} known {{approximation}} algorithm only provides a 9 / 5 approximation ratio. The objective {{of this paper is}} threefold. First, by embedding the problem within a stochastic framework, we present a novel algorithm for the SCP that: (i) is asymptotically optimal, i. e., it produces, almost surely, a solution approaching the optimal one as the number of pickups/deliveries goes to infinity; and (ii) has computational complexity O(n^ 2 +), where n is the number of pickup/delivery pairs and is an arbitrarily small positive constant. Second, we asymptotically characterize the length of the optimal SCP tour. Finally, we study a dynamic version of the SCP, whereby pickup and delivery requests arrive according to a Poisson process, and which serves as a model for large-scale <b>demand-responsive</b> transport (DRT) <b>systems.</b> For such a dynamic counterpart of the SCP, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of stable vehicle routing policies, which depends only on the workspace geometry, the stochastic distributions of pickup and delivery points, the arrival rate of requests, and the number of vehicles.

40|$|An aging {{population}} in the US, low-density urban sprawl and the accessibility needs of certain groups (particularly disabled and aged) increasingly point to more flexible <b>demand-responsive</b> transit <b>systems</b> in the future. This paper describes the important aspects of a consumer-oriented Personalized Demand Responsive Transit (PDRT) service. The system will provide services to the traveling public for journeys to work and for journeys to other destinations. A PDRT that responds to the travelers' needs and {{takes advantage of the}} emerging advanced public transportation technologies to increase efficiency may be successful and sustainable in the long term. To understand travelers' willingness to use and pay for PDRT, focus groups and a CATI (Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview) survey of automobile and transit travelers were conducted in the San Francisco Bay Area. The objective was to investigate service attributes that will attract travelers to PDRT. Specifically, we examine the factors that are likely to influence the decision to take "on-demand" PDRT (similar to a taxi service with a van making multiple pick-ups) and "fixed-schedule" PDRT (pick-ups and drop-offs are made at fixed but convenient locations). The results of six focus groups and the survey indicate that the idea of a personalized transit service may appeal to commuters as well as non-commuters. There is significant potential to attract travelers to PDRT; about 15 % (N= 1000) of those surveyed reported that they were "very likely" to use the PDRT service and another 47. 7 % (N= 1000) were willing to consider PDRT as an option. A majority of these PDRT pre-disposed were willing to pay between $ 5 -$ 10 for a 30 minute trip using fixed-schedule service (62 %; N= 627) and on-demand service (73. 0 %; N= 642). A majority of the PDRT predisposed were also willing to use the service despite an average 20 -minute wait time for pickup and 54. 5 % were willing to take PDRT despite it taking 15 to 20 minutes longer than their current commute or most frequent trip. Responses to attitudinal questions revealed a strong (positive) preference for flexibility in scheduling pick-up times, conducting criminal/driving background checks on all van drivers and being dropped off at the front door after dark (for safety reasons). The results show that a reasonably priced PDRT service that is reliable and meets customer expectations (of cost, travel time and wait time) can be successful. Respondents were quite realistic in their expectations about the PDRT service attributes, especially the longer travel times and wait times involved in using PDRT.

A widely-encountered type of PDP is the Stacker Crane Problem (SCP), where each commodity/customer is associated with a pickup location and a delivery location, and the objective is to find a minimum-length tour visiting all locations with the constraint that each pickup location and its associated delivery location are visited in consecutive order. The SCP is NP-Hard and the best known approximation algorithm only provides a 9 / 5 approximation ratio. The objective of this paper is threefold. First, by embedding the problem within a stochastic framework, we present a novel algorithm for the SCP that: (i) is asymptotically optimal, i. e., it produces, almost surely, a solution approaching the optimal one as the number of pickups/deliveries goes to infinity; and (ii) has computational complexity O(n 2 +ε), where n is the number of pickup/delivery pairs and ε is an arbitrarily small positive constant. Second, we asymptotically characterize the length of the optimal SCP tour. Finally, we study a dynamic version of the SCP, whereby pickup {{and delivery}} requests arrive according to a Poisson process, and which serves as a model for large-scale <b>demand-responsive</b> transport (DRT) <b>systems.</b> For such a dynamic counterpart of the SCP, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of stable vehicle routing policies, which depends only on the workspace geometry, the stochastic distributions of pickup and delivery points, the arrival rate of requests, and the number of vehicles. Our results leverage a novel connection between the Euclidean Bipartite Matching Problem and the theory of random permutations, and, for the dynamic setting, exhibit novel features that are absent in traditional spatially-distributed queueing systems.

40|$|The overall aim of {{the present}} thesis was to explore and characterise {{occupational}} participation and community mobility from an occupational perspective of health and well-being, and to elucidate potential barriers and facilitators for occupational participation and community mobility in older men and women. In Study I, questionnaires were sent {{to a sample of}} older citizens (75 +) in three Swedish mid-sized municipalities. This survey focused on actual and preferred travel opportunities and was returned by 957 persons (response rate 46 %). Although older people appreciated the existing travel opportunities, there was evidence of restricted community mobility for some sub-groups of older people, due to various perceived barriers. More efforts must be put into accessibility improvements including usability from the perspective of older people. In Study II nine focus group interviews with a total of 42 participants (20 men) were conducted, focusing on older peoples’ motives for, and experiences of, community mobility and occupational participation outside the home. The main category “Continuing mobility and occupational participation outside the home in old age is an act of negotiation” summarised the findings. This main category was abstracted from the generic categories “Occupational means and goals”, “Occupational and mobility adaptation” and “Occupational barriers and facilitators”, and their subcategories. Community mobility was identified as an important occupation that in itself also facilitated occupational participation outside the home. Individual community mobility seemed to be influenced by, for example, age and gender, as well as habits acquired over time. Furthermore, community mobility was negatively affected not only by physical barriers, but also by social and attitudinal barriers in the public environment. Study III identified and described older people’s viewpoints on community mobility and occupational participation in older age through a Q-methodology study conducted with 36 participants, including men and women, both drivers and non-drivers. Three viewpoints were found and assigned content-descriptive denominations; viz. : “Prefer being mobile by car”, “Prefer being mobile by public transport” and “Prefer flexible mobility”. Unfortunately, the existing <b>demand-responsive</b> Special Transportation <b>Systems</b> was not considered an attractive enough alternative by any of the participants. Thus, intermediate community mobility options are needed for those who no longer can drive or use public transport. In Study IV factors associated with community mobility, and decreased community mobility over time, for older men and women were described. Data were based on the Gender study “Aging in men and women: a longitudinal study of gender differences in health behaviour and health among elderly” and collected through surveys in 1994 and 2007. The base-line sample consisted of 605 twin-pairs, i. e., 1, 210 individuals, aged 69 - 88, and the follow-up of 357 individuals (165 men and 192 women), aged 83 - 97. This surveycovered health and health-related issues including community mobility and occupational participation. Continuing community mobility was cross-sectionally (at follow-up) and prospectively (from baseline to follow-up) associated with better self-reported subjective health rather than self-reported health conditions for both men and women. For men, community mobility was also cross-sectionally associated with few or non-existant depressive symptoms, while reduced community mobility was prospectively associated with higher age for women. Consequently, interventions aiming to enable community mobility must move beyond interventions directed towards health conditions and instead target subjective health and well-being...|$|R
