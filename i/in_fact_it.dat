5|$|Match Point (2005), a film by Woody Allen borrows many {{elements}} from the novel, <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> is {{loosely based on}} it. In the movie the name of Dostoyevsky is referred to in several occasions.|$|E
5|$|Ethernet {{standards}} require {{electrical isolation}} between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) {{and the network}} cable up to 1500VAC or 2250VDC for 60seconds. USB has no such requirement as it was designed for peripherals closely associated with a host computer, and <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> connects the peripheral and host grounds. This gives Ethernet a significant safety advantage over USB with peripherals such as cable and DSL modems connected to external wiring that can assume hazardous voltages under certain fault conditions.|$|E

5|$|Parachutes was {{recognised}} to have {{an alternative}} rock sound similar to English band Radiohead in their Bends era. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> {{has been suggested that}} the album's commercial success was due in part to a portion of Radiohead's audience being alienated by the band's experimental and more electronic-influenced Kid A album.|$|E
5|$|Squab pie is a {{traditional}} dish from South West England, with early records showing it was associated with Cornwall, Devon and Gloucestershire. Although the name suggests it contains squab (young domestic pigeon), <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> contains mutton and apples. The pie was eaten {{around the world in}} the 1900s, though outside South West England it generally did contain pigeon. It is no longer a popular dish, with less than 3% of British teenagers surveyed having eaten it.|$|E
5|$|TCDD and dioxin-like {{compounds}} act via {{a specific}} receptor {{present in all}} cells: the aryl hydrocarbon (AH) receptor. This receptor is a transcription factor which is involved in expression of genes; <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> {{has been shown that}} high doses of TCDD either increase or decrease the expression of several hundred genes in rats. Genes of enzymes activating the breakdown of foreign and often toxic compounds are classic examples of such genes. TCDD increases the enzymes breaking down, e.g., carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons such as benzo(a)pyrene.|$|E

5|$|The crucial {{property}} {{turns out}} to be treewidth, a measure of how tree-like the graph is. For a graph G of treewidth at most k and a graph H, the homomorphism problem can be solved in time |V(H)|O(k) with a standard dynamic programming approach. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> is enough to assume that the core of G has treewidth at most k. This holds even if the core is not known.|$|E
5|$|The expeditionary corps {{was made}} up of nine {{infantry}} regiments: Régiment d’Infanterie] says that this regiment left for the Morea (<b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> formed part of the replacements that arrived in 1830). The composition of the brigades is that given by A. Hugon, as it is the most precise.|$|E
5|$|Another factor behind Echmarcach's {{actions against}} Sitriuc could concern Knútr. Echmarcach's seizure of Dublin {{occurred}} {{only a year}} after the latter's death in 1035. There appears to be numismatic evidence, annalistic evidence, and charter evidence indicating that Knútr and Sitriuc had cooperated together in terms of trade and military operations in Wales. In contrast to this apparent congeniality, the relationship between Knútr and Echmarcach appears to have been less amiable. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> is possible that Echmarcach's meeting with Knútr may have bound him from taking action against Sitriuc, and that the confusion caused by Knútr's demise may have enabled Echmarcach to exploit the situation by seizing control of the Irish Sea region.|$|E

5|$|Banksia sessilis {{is highly}} {{susceptible}} to dieback {{caused by the}} introduced plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil-borne water mould that causes root rot; <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> is so reliably susceptible that it is considered a good indicator species {{for the presence of}} the disease. Most highly susceptible species quickly become locally extinct in infected areas, {{and in the absence of}} hosts the disease itself eventually dies out. However, B.sessilis, being an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open ground, often colonises old disease sites. The new colonies are themselves infected, and thus P.cinnamomi survives at these sites indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Cooperation did {{not long}} survive the war. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on {{subsequent}} administrations. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> was physically lost. When Wilson raised {{the matter in}} a Combined Policy Committee meeting in June, the American copy could not be found. The British sent Stimson a photocopy on 18 July 1945. Even then, Groves questioned the document's authenticity until the American copy was located years later in the papers of Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, Jr., Roosevelt's naval aide, apparently misfiled by someone unaware of what Tube Alloys was, who thought {{it had something to}} do with naval guns.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Mid-County Expressway, in 1996 the Interstate 476 designation was extended to include {{the entire length of the}} existing Northeast Extension, replacing PA 9. The Northeast Extension was built between 1955 and 1957 and was originally projected to continue past Clarks Summit to the New York border; however, I-81 was built between these two points instead. Since the extension, I-476 has been the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway in the United States (surpassing Interstate 495 in Massachusetts), but it may someday be surpassed in length by Interstate 369 in Texas. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> is longer than some mainline interstates (such as Interstate 83 in Maryland and Pennsylvania, Interstate 99 in Pennsylvania, Interstate 12 in Louisiana, Interstate 19 in Arizona, Interstate 97 in Maryland, and Interstate 2 in Texas). Additionally, its numbering is unusual, since auxiliary interstates beginning in even numbers are typically bypasses or loops rather than spurs.|$|E

5|$|In 1561, he {{finished}} his Historia General de las Indias and signed {{it over to the}} College of San Gregorio, stipulating that it could not be published until after forty years. <b>In</b> <b>fact</b> <b>it</b> was not published for 314 years, finally being done so in 1875. He also had to repeatedly defend himself against accusations of treason: someone, possibly Sepúlveda, denounced him to the Spanish Inquisition, but nothing came from the case. Las Casas also appeared as a witness {{in the case of the}} Inquisition against his friend Archbishop Bartolomé Carranza de Miranda, who had been falsely accused of heresy. In 1565 he wrote his last will, signing over his immense library to the college. Bartolomé de Las Casas died on July 18, 1566, in Madrid.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, an {{overwhelming}} majority of voters in the TID and MID service areas and San Francisco approved bond issues to finance {{the construction of a new}} dam. The irrigation districts hoped to complete the dam by 1966, but concerns that the dam would further impact decreasing populations of king salmon in the Tuolumne put a temporary stop to the project. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> was not until that year that the Federal Power Commission (now Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) licensed the irrigation districts to go ahead on New Don Pedro.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{historian}} Mark Humphries of Canada's Memorial University of Newfoundland {{stated that}} newly unearthed records confirmed {{that one of}} the side stories of the war, the mobilization of 96,000 Chinese laborers to work behind the British and French lines on World War I's western front, might have been the source of the pandemic. In the report, Humphries found archival evidence that a respiratory illness that struck northern China in November 1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the Spanish flu. However, a report published in 2016 in the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association found no evidence that the 1918 virus was imported to Europe from Chinese and Southeast Asian soldiers and workers. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> found evidence that the virus had been circulating in the European armies for months and potentially years before the 1918 pandemic.|$|E

5|$|In {{some cases}} the signal {{receiver}} is lured toward the mimic. This involves mimicry of a resource that is often vital to the prey's survival (or more precisely, the survival of its genes) such as nutrition or a mate. If the bait offered is of little value to prey {{they would not be}} expected to take such a risk. For example, in all known cases of sexual signal mimicry it is always the male sex that is deceived (<b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> has been suggested that females of some species have evolved mimicry as a strategy to avoid unwanted matings). In these cases the predator need not move about foraging for prey, but may simply stay still and allow prey to come to it.|$|E
5|$|Lessons had a {{significant}} effect on the development of children's literature in Britain and the United States. Maria Edgeworth, Sarah Trimmer, Jane Taylor, and Ellenor Fenn, to name a few of the most illustrious, were inspired to become children's authors because of Lessons and their works dominated children's literature for several generations. Lessons itself was reprinted for over a century. However, because of the disrepute that educational writings fell into, largely due to the low esteem awarded Barbauld, Trimmer, and others by contemporary male Romantic writers, Barbauld's Lessons has rarely been studied by scholars. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> has only been analysed in depth since the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Echmarcach's short reign in Dublin other than an attack on Skryne and Duleek, {{recorded}} by the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters in 1037. This strike could have been undertaken {{in the context of}} the Dubliner's gradual loss of power in Brega, and an attempt to regain authority of Skryne. Although there is no direct evidence that Echmarcach controlled Mann at this point in his career, Sitriuc does not appear to have taken refuge on the island after his expulsion from Dublin. This seems to suggest that the island was outwith Sitriuc's possession, and may indicate that Mann had fallen into the hands of Echmarcach sometime before. <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>it</b> is possible that Echmarcach may have used the island to launch his takeover of Dublin.|$|E
5000|$|Since most Alsace {{wines are}} varietally labeled, it {{is a common}} {{misunderstanding}} to believe [...] "Klevener de Heiligenstein" [...] to be a local variety. <b>In</b> <b>facts,</b> <b>it</b> is the only geographical designation within the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) Alsace.|$|R
