5|$|There {{have been}} several engine {{failures}} in the early service of the CFM56 family which were serious enough to either ground the fleet or require aspects of the engine to be redesigned. The engines have also suffered, periodically, from thrust instability events tentatively traced to Honeywell's <b>hydromechanical</b> unit.|$|E
5|$|Most {{variants}} of the CFM56 feature a single-annular combustor. An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is {{injected into the}} airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow. Other types of combustors include can combustors, where each combustion chamber is separate, and canannular which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a <b>Hydromechanical</b> Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine {{by means of an}} electrohydraulic servo valve that, in turn, drives a fuel metering valve, that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (FADEC).|$|E
25|$|The engine exhaust, exiting at {{the rear}} left, is cooled to reduce the thermal {{signature}} of the Leclerc. Transmission is a <b>hydromechanical</b> type with five forward and two reverse gears. Fuel tanks carry 1,300 litres and act as extra protection for the tank; two 200-litre external tanks can be fitted on {{the rear of the}} turret, but these have to be jettisoned before entering combat, since they limit turret rotation.|$|E
25|$|An uprated version, the 2300lbf (10.23kN) thrust FJ44-2A, was {{introduced}} in 1997. It has a larger 21.7 in (551mm) diameter fan, with two additional booster stages to increase core flow. Owing to stressing considerations, the centrifugal compressor is throttled-back aerodynamically to a lower HPC pressure ratio than the -1. Other features include an exhaust mixer and an electronic fuel control unit. The 2400lbf (10.68kN) thrust FJ44-2C {{is similar to the}} -2A, but incorporates an integrated <b>hydromechanical</b> fuel control unit.|$|E
25|$|The BMP-3 has a {{range of}} 600km, an {{altitude}} of operation of up to 3,000m and it is transportable by train, truck, sea, and air. The BMP-3 engine is a diesel four-stroke, liquid-cooled design. The transmission is a four-speed <b>hydromechanical</b> power unit, with power takeoff to its water jets. The suspension is independent, with a torsion bar and six hydraulic shock absorbers. Steering is by gear differential with hydrostatic drive. The track adjusting mechanism is remotely controlled from the driver's station, with tension force indication. The water-jet propulsion unit is single-stage, axial, auger-type.|$|E
25|$|Ti-67s - This is the Ti-67 {{with many}} other {{improvements}} {{in addition to all}} of the previous modifications. They include fitting the American Detroit Diesel 8V-71T engine developing 609hp, new semi-automatic <b>hydromechanical</b> transmission equipped with a torque converter, new air cleaners, Blazer explosive reactive armor added to the hull and turret, Cadillac-Gage-Textron gun stabilization system, installation of EL-OP Matador computerized fire control system, low-profile commander's cupola, IR detectors, Image-intensifier night vision equipment for the commander, gunner and driver, Spectronix fire detection and suppression system, new turret basket, extensive external stowage, modernized driver's station including replacement of tillers by a steering wheel, new final drives, new all-internal fuel system and improved suspension.|$|E
25|$|With 41 deposits, it {{was named}} 7X in November with first flight {{slipping}} from late 2004 to early 2005 and certification planned for mid-2006. With a simplified structure to reduce cost and weight, the optimised high-transonic wing improves by more than 10% the lift-to-drag ratio over the supercritical-section wing of the Falcon 50 shared by previous Falcons. The cabin is 2.4m (8ft) longer than the 900 and have a lower 6,000ft (1,800m) cabin altitude. the 6,100lb-thrust (21.7kN) PW307A was finally selected, among other risk-sharing partners: Honeywell for avionics architecture, auxiliary power unit, air management system; with Parker Hannifin for the power generation system and wheels brakes; and TRW Aeronautical Systems for the <b>hydromechanical</b> flap and airbrake systems.|$|E
25|$|The engine {{compartment}} {{is located in}} the rear of the vehicle and consists of: a 2V-06-02 water-cooled diesel engine developing 450hp, a main clutch, a gearbox, a final drives, and brakes. The suspension of the vehicle consists of five rubber-tyred road wheels on each side, a drive sprocket at the rear, an idler at the front, and four track-return rollers. The BMD-3 is fitted with a new <b>hydromechanical</b> transmission with hydrostatic steering mechanism. This adjustable suspension gives a ground clearance between 130 and 530mm with 450mm being the default. This hydropneumatic suspension allows the BMD-3 to decrease its height to be able to board transport aircraft like the Il-76M. The ground clearance is adjusted by the driver and it takes 10 seconds to lower or raise the suspension. The maximum road speed is 70km/h and the maximum off-road speed is 45km/h. The vehicle can achieve an operational range of up to 500km on paved roads and can climb up to 60% gradient and move on a 30% side slope. The ground pressure exerted by the BMD-3 is 0.48 kg/cm2 with standard tracks and 0.32kg/cm2 with broader tracks.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the YF-17, {{which had}} <b>hydromechanical</b> {{controls}} {{serving as a}} backup to the FBW, General Dynamics took the innovative step of eliminating mechanical linkages between the control stick and rudder pedals, and the flight control surfaces. The F-16 is entirely reliant on its electrical systems to relay flight commands, instead of traditional mechanically-linked controls, leading to the early moniker of [...] "the electric jet". The quadruplex design permits [...] "graceful degradation" [...] in flight control response in {{that the loss of}} one channel renders the FLCS a [...] "triplex" [...] system. The FLCC began as an analog system on the A/B variants, but has been supplanted by a digital computer system beginning with the F-16C/D Block 40. The F-16's controls suffered from a sensitivity to static electricity or electrostatic discharge (ESD). Up to 70–80% of the C/D models' electronics were vulnerable to ESD.|$|E
500|$|Airlines have {{reported}} 32 events involving sudden instability of thrust, {{at various points}} during flight, including high thrust settings during climb to altitude. The problem has been long-standing. In 1998, two 737 pilots reported that their engine throttles suddenly increased to full thrust during flight. A very recent investigation {{has led to the}} tentative conclusion that the problem originates in the <b>Hydromechanical</b> unit, and may involve an unacceptable level of fuel contamination (with water, or particulate matter, including biodegradable material that create solids in the fuel), or overuse of biocides to reduce bacterial growth. Boeing told Aviation Week and Space Technology that CFM International had revised its FADEC software. The new software [...] "...'reduces the duration and degree of thrust-instability events' by cycling the fuel monitoring valve (FMV) and the EHSV (electrohydraulic servo unit) to clean the EHSV spool." [...] This software fix is not intended to be a definitive solution to the problem; CFM claimed that no further reports have reached it after this change was made.|$|E
2500|$|With purely {{mechanical}} {{flight control}} systems, the aerodynamic {{forces on the}} control surfaces are transmitted through the mechanisms and are felt directly by the pilot, allowing tactile feedback of airspeed. With <b>hydromechanical</b> flight control systems, however, the load on the surfaces cannot be felt {{and there is a}} risk of overstressing the aircraft through excessive control surface movement. To overcome this problem, artificial feel systems can be used. For example, for the controls of the RAF's Avro Vulcan jet bomber and the RCAF's Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow supersonic interceptor (both 1950s-era designs), the required force feedback was achieved by a spring device. [...] The fulcrum of this device was moved in proportion to the square of the air speed (for the elevators) to give increased resistance at higher speeds. For the controls of the American Vought F-8 Crusader and the LTV A-7 Corsair II warplanes, a 'bob-weight' was used in the pitch axis of the control stick, giving force feedback that was proportional to the airplane's normal acceleration.|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{engine control}} (EEC): An EEC is {{essentially}} a <b>hydromechanical</b> fuel control but with added electrical components to prevent overheating or overspeeding the engine. If the electrical part of the control should fail, an EEC will revert to a standard <b>hydromechanical</b> fuel control.|$|E

50|$|Electronic {{automatic}} transmissions have been changing in design from purely <b>hydromechanical</b> controls to electronic controls {{since the late}} 1980s. Since then, development has been iterative and today designs exist from several stages of electronic automatic transmission control development. Transmission solenoids are a key component to these control units.|$|E

Has dual <b>hydromechanical</b> flight controls {{that can be}} operated from tandem cockpits, a more spacious lower cockpit to house a flight instructor, a wider pilot canopy, and new energy-absorbing crew seats. Serves as a trainer but can perform attack helicopter tasks.|$|E
50|$|Deep drawing {{has been}} {{classified}} into conventional and unconventional deep drawing. The main aim of any unconventional {{deep drawing process}} is to extend the formability limits of the process. Some of the unconventional processes include <b>hydromechanical</b> deep drawing, Hydroform process, Aquadraw process, Guerin process, Marform process and the hydraulic deep drawing process to name a few.|$|E
50|$|Speed control via a {{governor}} is {{another type of}} servomechanism. The steam engine uses mechanical governors; another early application was to govern the speed of water wheels. Prior to World War II the constant speed propeller was developed to control engine speed for maneuvering aircraft. Fuel controls for gas turbine engines employ either <b>hydromechanical</b> or electronic governing.|$|E

50|$|Stall was {{a common}} problem on early jet engines with simple {{aerodynamics}} and manual or mechanical fuel control units, but has been virtually eliminated by better design {{and the use of}} <b>hydromechanical</b> and electronic control systems such as Full Authority Digital Engine Controls. Modern compressors are carefully designed and controlled to avoid or limit stall within an engine's operating range.|$|E
