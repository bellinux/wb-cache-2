Although the concept of <b>gob</b> breathing is simple, its effect on spontaneous heating of coal in the <b>gob</b> area is not clear. In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to model the spontaneous heating of coal in longwall <b>gob</b> area under measured barometric pressure changes. A single longwall panel using a bleederless ventilation system was simulated. If there is no barometric pressure change, the intake airflow rate is equal to the return airflow rate. When the barometric pressure changes, these two airflow rates are no longer equal, and {{the difference between the two}} airflow rates represents the airflow rate the <b>gob</b> breathes in and out. The effect of inflow and outflow of gas on the potential spontaneous heating in the <b>gob</b> was investigated using the CFD model developed in our previous study.

40|$|Obliteration (<b>gobbing)</b> {{caused by}} water based {{lubricating}} fluids is studied experimentally {{by analyzing the}} flow through a small channel. Flow measurements, energy dispersive X-ray microscopy and photos show, {{that the rate of}} <b>gobbing</b> depends on which type of fluid that is being used. The explanation of the obliteration is chemical reactions between the fluids and surrounding material or dust in the fluids. In order to get {{a better understanding of the}} rheology of emulsions, the migration of visible spheres, with varying density, flowing downstreams through a vertical, rectangular channel, is studied. The results from the experiments show, that the equilibrium position of a sphere is a function of the density difference between the sphere and surrounding fluid. A density difference of 0. 5 per mille is enough to give stable positions. A theory is presented, which gives good agreement with the experimental results. Experiments have also been carried out in order to measure the effective viscosity of emulsions, flowing through a small horizontal channel. The viscosity is lower than the value obtained in a rotational viscosimeter. A theoretical explanation is proposed. An interesting example of two-phase flow is studied by means of a new prototype of a nozzle which lubricates a water jet with air. With this experimental nozzle, the dynamic pressure of the water jet increases 37 per cent. The explanation of this improvement is that some of the air forms a layer between the tube wall and the water, thus reducing friction between wall and water, giving a higher velocity of the water jet. With the results from the experimental nozzle in mind, five different full scale water cannon nozzles are designed, each with a certain method of air injection. The casting length, water flow and power consumption are measured and compared to a conventional nozzle. The performance is strongly dependent on the rate of water flow. For water flows of order 7 dm 3 /s, an increase in casting length of 12 per cent was achieved compared to a conventional nozzle. To achieve the same casting length, a conventional nozzle needs 39 per cent more power. Unfortunately the water flow with the new nozzle decreased with up to 48 per cent. For water flows of order 3 dm 3 /s, an increase in casting length of 93 per cent was achieved. To achieve the same casting length, a conventional nozzle needs 90 per cent more power. The water flow with the new nozzle decreased with 36 per cent. The final paper is an investigation of the lubrication between a plate and a rotating ball in normal approach. The normal velocity was varied between 0. 1 and 0. 5 m/s and the sliding velocity between 0 and 9. 2 m/s. The experiments show, that the viscosity is the most important lubricant parameter. The normal velocity, the pressure viscosity coefficient, and the shear strength proportionality constant do not affect the degree of lubrication. An increase of the sliding velocity gave a decrease of the degree of lubrication between 25 and 65 per cent depending on surface roughness and type of lubricant. The surface roughness is also of great importance in getting good lubrication. To avoid wear, one has to increase the viscosity from 8 to 145 mm 2 /S if the mean surface roughness, Ra, is increased from 0. 01 to 0. 14. Godkänd; 1987; 20070502 (ysko...|$|E

Commercial production of pipeline-quality <b>gob</b> well methane through wells drilled from the surface into the area above the <b>gob</b> can, if properly implemented, {{be the most effective}} means of reducing mine methane emissions. However, much of the gas produced from <b>gob</b> wells is vented because the quality of the gas is highly variable and is often below current natural gas pipeline specifications. Prior to the initiation of field-testing required to further understand the operational criteria for upgrading <b>gob</b> well gas, a preliminary evaluation and assessment was performed. An assessment of the methane gas in-place and producible methane resource at the Jim Walter Resources, Inc. No. 4 and No. 5 Mines established a potential 15 -year supply of 60 billion cubic feet of mien methane from <b>gob</b> wells, satisfying the resource criteria for the test site. To understand the effect of operating conditions on <b>gob</b> gas quality, <b>gob</b> wells producing pipeline quality (i. e., < 96 % hydrocarbons) gas at this site will be operated over a wide range of suction pressures. Parameters to be determined will include absolute methane quantity and methane concentration produced through the <b>gob</b> wells; working face, tailgate and bleeder entry methane levels in the mine; and the effect on the economics of production of <b>gob</b> wells at various levels of methane quality.

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{examined}} a pseudepigraphal gospel called the Gospel of Barnabas (<b>GOB).</b> This so called gospel {{has been an}} important part of the Muslim polemics against Christianity since the beginning of the 20 th century. Many Muslim scholars claim that it is the only true Gospel written by Jesus’ close disciple and apostle Barnabas. However, the majority of the Western scholars claim that it is really a medieval Islamic writing. My approach to the study of the <b>GOB</b> was quite theoretical; I used two different theories through which I tried to get new information on the <b>GOB.</b> The first theory is the counter-history theory developed by Amos Funkenstein and David Biale. Through this theory I examined the <b>GOB</b> itself and tried to analyse if it can be seen as a counter-history. With this theory I answered to the research question “what kind of text is the GOB?” The other theory is the power relations theory by James C. Scott. Through this theory I examined the historical situation of Moriscos in Spain and tried to see if it is reasonable to locate the origins of the <b>GOB</b> there. With power relations theory my aim was to answer to the research question “where and why was the <b>GOB</b> written?” Through the counter-history theory I found out that the author of the <b>GOB</b> has used mainly Christian sources to produce a different depiction of Jesus’ life. With the thematic analysis I discovered that the <b>GOB</b> redacts many important Christian dogmas with Islamic ideas and so produces an Islamic counter-history of the narratives of the canonical gospels. Hence, as an answer to the research question of what kind of text the <b>GOB</b> is, I would say that the <b>GOB</b> is an (polemical?) Islamic counter-history of the Christian idea of Jesus. Through the power relations theory I found out that the power relations between dominant Christians and subordinate Moriscos was a very fruitful context for a writing such as the <b>GOB</b> to emerge. The <b>GOB</b> can be seen as a disguised intellectual resistance, where the message and the messenger are hidden. It was probably written to influence the Christian majority. To the research question of where and why the <b>GOB</b> was written, I answer that it was probably written in Morisco Spain as an intellectual resistance...|$|R
