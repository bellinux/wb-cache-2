In an attempt to contribute to this debate, this study approaches the issue in a very specific socio-historical context, marked by recent accelerated industrialization {{in a small town in}} Northeast Brazil. Based on semi-structured interviews with leaders of four local NGOs, the way they perceive and value the risks introduced into the area and relations between industrialization and local development are analyzed. Findings show a strong adherence to the industrial plan by workers’ trade unions, whilst other NGOs are highly critical with <b>regard</b> <b>thereto,</b> but undertake no social or political activity regarding the issues they identify. This phenomenon is discussed in terms of the modus operandi of ideology and its strategies for symbolic construction, enabling a comprehensive reinterpretation of how capital also benefits, in its mobility, from local society’s fragility in organizing and protecting quality of life and public health...|$|R

40|$|In 1995 {{the ritual}} studies expert Ronald Grimes observed: ‘This generation’s {{intellectual}} task {{seems to be}} that of getting beyond Victor Turner’. 3 This was, however, roughly the same time that Victor Turner’s work was being discovered by a few theologians in South Africa who recognized the importance of concepts such as societas, communitas and liminality; they were also beginning to understand the significance of his notion of so-called social drama for in what was then a dramatically changing South African social context and along with that congregational contexts. Several theologians in general, especially practical theologians working in congregational studies, and some liturgists have since then also explored the value specifically of the concept of liminality for the church in South Africa and for South African society in general. In this article my aim will be to try and trace the path of the concept of liminality and its concomitant concepts in theological discourse in South Africa over the past two decades.

40|$|Spermidine synthase is {{currently}} {{considered as a}} promising drug target in the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, due to the vital role of spermidine in the activation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF 5 A) and cell proliferation. However, very limited information was available regarding the structure and mechanism of action of the protein {{at the start of}} this study. Structural and mechanistic insights of the P. falciparum spermidine synthase (PfSpdSyn) were obtained utilizing molecular dynamics simulations of a homology model based on the crystal structures of the Arabidopsis thaliana and Thermotoga maritima homologues. Our data are supported by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis of essential residues as well as by a crystal structure of the protein that became available recently. We provide, for the first time, dynamic evidence for the mechanism of the aminopropyltransferase action of PfSpdSyn. This characterization of the structural and mechanistic properties of the PfSpdSyn as well as the elucidation of the active site residues involved in substrate, product, and inhibitor interactions paves the way toward inhibitor selection or design of parasite-specific inhibitors.

40|$|There {{have been}} many recent changes {{in the field of}} tort law, but none as {{personal}} and important to each member of our society as the changes in tort liability theories for injuries associated with products and related services. It is difficult, if not impossible, to conceive of an individual in America today who is not exposed to some serious risk of injury from such a source, and, of course, the source is likewise exposed to a correlative liability. It is this latter exposure and the means of protecting against it {{that is the subject of}} this article. Although trial lawyers and judges are the natural objects of an article dealing with anything so fraught with litigation, it is hoped that the office practitioner will also find this of value in the way of preventive law practice. Certainly not every manufacturer that is sued on a products liability theory is a giant automobile manufacturer or chemical company in a distant location. There are many small and medium size manufacturers, not to mention wholesalers and retailers, whether in the form of sole proprietorships, partnerships, or corporations, that are subject to suits for products liability. One wonders how many of these entities are aware of the extent of their exposure and whether they are properly protected by insurance. Because of the broad nature of the exposure, the complexities of insurance coverages and resulting diversions in court decisions, the lawyer has a special obligation to educate himself as to the problems in this area and counsel his clients <b>in</b> <b>regard</b> <b>thereto.</b> One of the purposes of this article is to help prepare the lawyer for that task...|$|E

40|$|We have {{fabricated}} a symmetric electrochemical capacitor {{with high}} energy and power densities {{based on a}} composite of graphene foam (GF) with ~ 80 wt% of manganese oxide (MnO 2) deposited by hydrothermal synthesis. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements showed the presence of nanocrystalline MnO 2 on the GF, while scanning and transmission electron microscopies showed needle-like manganese oxide coated and anchored {{onto the surface of}} graphene. Electrochemical measurements of the composite electrode gave a specific capacitance of 240 Fg- 1 at a current density of 0. 1 Ag- 1 for symmetric supercapacitors using a two-electrode configuration. A maximum energy density of 8. 3 Whkg- 1 was obtained, with power density of 20 kWkg- 1 and no capacitance loss after 1000 cycles. GF is an excellent support for pseudo-capacitive oxide materials such as MnO 2, and the composite electrode provided a high energy density due to a combination of doublelayer and redox capacitance mechanisms.

40|$|A {{key benefit}} and {{evolutionary}} driver of group living is reduced predation risk. In white rhinos, groups comprise adult females, their calves {{and one to}} six unrelated subadults. Subadults benefit from group living through exposure to novel areas, and protection from territorial males (i. e. ‘buddy system’). In contrast, {{it is unclear whether}} mothers benefit from group living. To determine if they benefit, or if there is simply no cost, we recorded the vigilance of white rhino mothers in different-sized groups. We predicted that as group size increased, calves would have lower predation risk and mothers would reduce their vigilance. In contrast, we found that vigilance did not decrease as group size increased. Our findings thus indicate that decreased vigilance is not a benefit that white rhino mothers gain from living in groups. Also, costs of group formation are minimal for mothers as their large body size and ability to feed {{on a wide range of}} grasses reduces competition with other group members. As a result, we suggest that the benefits obtained by subadults, coupled with the lack of costs to adult females, are the main drivers of group formation in white rhinos.

40|$|This study {{undertook}} to derive share repurchase trends {{from a small}} sample of JSE-listed companies over the nine years, 1999 - 2008. The study also draws attention to the particular obstacles to be overcome when conducting research into the unique South African share repurchases environment. The study finds that 33 companies made 71 repurchase announcements (47 general and 24 specific) via the Securities Exchange News Service (SENS) over the period July 1999 until financial year-end in 2008. On average, 59, 0 % {{of the total number of}} shares (and 49, 3 % of the total value) repurchased under a general authority is not included in the 3 % SENS announcements. General share repurchases represent 47, 9 % of total repurchases in volume (and 60, 5 % in terms of value). The total number of shares repurchased (excluding share trust purchases) by the 33 companies shows that 56, 8 % were repurchased by subsidiaries and 17, 1 % were subsequent repurchases by companies from subsidiaries. (In value, these repurchases represent 53, 7 % and 17, 2 %, respectively.) This study therefore concludes that research based on only the 3 % SENS announcements of general share buy-backs results in significant understating of actual total share buy-back activities, and that the South African share repurchase environment presents unique challenges. The main obstacle for future South African research in this field however is the lack of comprehensive and accurate share repurchase data as supplied by South African financial data sources.

40|$|We {{report on}} the space charge {{spectroscopy}} studies performed on thermally treated melt-grown single crystal ZnO. The samples were annealed in different ambients at 700 C and also in oxygen ambient at different temperatures. A shallow donor with a thermal activation enthalpy of 27 meV was observed in the as-received samples by capacitance-temperature, CT scans. After annealing the samples, {{an increase in the}} shallow donor concentrations was observed. For the annealed samples, E 27 could not be detected and a new shallow donor with a thermal activation enthalpy of 35 meV was detected. For samples annealed above 650 C, an increase in acceptor concentration was observed which affected the low temperature capacitance. Deep level transient spectroscopy revealed the presence of five deep level defects, E 1, E 2, E 3, E 4, and E 5 in the as-received samples. Annealing of the samples at 650 C removes the E 4 and E 5 deep level defects, while E 2 also anneals-out at temperatures above 800 C. After annealing at 700 C, the T 2 deep level defect was observed in all other ambient conditions except in Ar. The emission properties of the E 3 deep level defect are observed to change with increase in annealing temperature beyond 800 C. For samples annealed beyond 800 C, a decrease in activation enthalpy with increase in annealing temperature has been observed which suggests an enhanced thermal ionization rate of E 3 with annealing.

40|$|Coprolites {{are often}} used in African archaeological sites as {{archives}} for proxies like pollen, which are trapped and preserved inside them. Investigating pollen taphonomy, here we aim to aid interpretations of local and regional vegetation changes by assessing dietary and other pollen sources of fresh hyaena scats from the Tswalu Kalahari Reserve (TKR, South Africa) and coprolites from Equus Cave (South Africa). Our hypothesis is that {{the inner and outer}} fractions of coprolites possibly reflect qualitative and quantitative differences of dispersal factors of pollen taxa during the stages of scat formation influenced by hyaena behaviour and pollen sticking to wet surfaces after defecation. We mechanically separated the inner and outer sections of each scat and coprolite and extracted pollen from both fractions for analyses. The results were associated with vegetation maps of TKR and compared with pollen in modern soils, as controls, and quantitatively analysed in order to test potential differences in quality and richness of pollen between the inner and outer parts of samples. Scats and coprolites seem to be less biased sensors of vegetation than surface soil samples. Further, the inner parts of coprolites and scats provide significantly greater diversity of low pollen-producers including entomophilous types than the outer sections which may typically be biased by wind-transported types and less productive due to pollen loss by weathering. The core fraction might therefore be useful for representing the under-represented taxa in pollen assemblages from the surroundings where hyenas roam. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
