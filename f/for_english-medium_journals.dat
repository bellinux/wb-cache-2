It remains unclear precisely which aspects of research article (RA) writing in English present these writers with the greatest challenge and just why they perceive this increase in difficulty. A structured questionnaire comprising thirty-seven questions about researchers’ publication experiences in scientific journals in English and in Spanish was designed and sent out to all (n = 8, 794) Spanish postdoctoral researchers at one research-only institution and four universities in Spain, yielding responses from 1, 717 researchers.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about what an {{apprentice}} scholar in a non-Anglophone context undergoes when writing a research article <b>for</b> publication in <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals.</b> This study highlights "a rich notion of agency" by examining a nonnative-English-speaking graduate student's engagement with his community of practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998) as he wrote {{the first draft of}} an article in chemistry. The primary data were the student's process logs, his developing text, and his Bulletin Board System message exchanges and post-hoc interviews. The study illustrates the apprentice scholar's engagement with the local research community, the laboratory data, his own experience/practice of writing research articles (RAs), and the global specialist research community. His engagement with the global specialist research community includes a critical orientation. The article also points out the value of providing EAP pedagogical support for the critical perspectives that students like Yuan adopt, and it calls for the training of EAP-qualified professionals in non-Anglophone contexts. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the growing phenomenon of <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> in non-Anglophone countries, few of which achieve considerable international visibility {{as measured by}} inclusion in SCI and SSCI lists. The study investigates this phenomenon in Serbia, where a similar rise in <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> is taking place, by exploring the views of editors of <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> published in Serbia. Editors have been chosen as informants for the study because of their influential position as shapers of the practices and policies of the journals they edit and because of their privileged access to journal-related information that is not publicly available. The participants were fifteen editors of <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> in Serbia {{in a range of}} disciplines. In addition to gathering bibliometric data about the participants’ journals, face-to-face interviews were conducted with five editors, and ten editors responded to a list of open-ended questions by email. This chapter reports and discusses two major themes: (i) the editors’ perspectives on the motivations behind the journals’ adoption of English and their related goals enabled by the use of English, and (ii) the editors views on the nature of their journals vis-à-vis the national/international dichotomy. It is shown that <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> in Serbia constitute a diverse category, with different histories, goals and practices related to the use of English. Editors’ perspectives show that the use of English as the medium of publication is motivated by a range of goals at different levels, from local institutional goals to goals related to international exchange, as well as by both ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors. In terms of the nature of <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> on the semiperiphery, it is argued that they should be understood as a translocal phenomenon due to the knowledge flows they enable between various local contexts as well as with higher-than-local levels. The chapter closes by discussing the implications of the findings about the roles <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> play in the local academic community, on the semiperiphery, and in global academic publishing...|$|R

40|$|The {{dominant}} position of English in international scholarship and increasing pressures on scholars worldwide to publish in English are now well documented (for example, Belcher 2007, Buckingham 2014, Canagarajah 2002, Curry and Lillis 2004, Ferguson et al. 2011, Flowerdew 1999 a, 1999 b, 2000, Hamel 2007,Hanauer and Englander 2013, Lillis and Curry 2006, 2010, Uzuner 2008). One of the less-explored {{consequences of this}} trend is the growth of <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> in non-Anglophone countries. While the extent of Anglicization of periodicals varies across countries and disciplinary areas, with the hard sciences more prone to Anglicization than the humanities, this trend seems to be pervasive and ongoing (see, for instance, Gibbs 1995, Lillis 2012, Lillis and Curry 2010, Pérez-Llantada et al. 2011, Swales 1997). As <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> are on the rise, those in local languages seem to be disappearing from the scene, as scholars increasingly publish in English rather than in their local languages. For instance, between 1999 and 2006, the numbers of papers in Spanish-language journals published in Spain decreased by half (Pérez-Llantada et al. 2011); similarly, the proportion of medical publications in Italian in the PubMed database fell by 60 per cent between 1986 and 2005, showing ‘the gradual peripheralization of Italian’ as the language of medical science (Giannoni 2008, p. 105). Giannoni (2008) also cites data showing that the entire output of Italian researchers in some areas (mathematics, food quality, chemistry) is now published in English, either in international journals or in Italian <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals.</b> As Moreno (2013) half-jokingly stated in a recent conference presentation commenting {{on the situation in}} Spain, discourse analysts must act fast if they wish to collect academic papers in local languages while they still exist, especially in hard science and technological areas...|$|R

Indeed Svartvik and Leech (156) include such a variety — international standard English or world standard English — in their model of Englishes.

Given growing pressure for academics {{from around the world to}} publish in certain <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals,</b> the journal submission guidelines offer important information for authors. Yet, while there is increasing awareness of the burden imposed on EAL scholars in having to write scientific articles in English, little attention has been paid to the language policies of the international journals.

Evidence from a longitudinal “text-ethnographic” study exploring how 50 psychology and education scholars in southern and central Europe {{are responding to}} such pressure indicates that individual linguistic and rhetorical competence alone are usually insufficient for securing publication in <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals.</b> Rather, scholars’ accounts demonstrate that participation in academic research networks functions as a key resource for publishing. This article examines the importance of networks and tracks how scholars gain access to and participate in them. We present ‘network histories’ that map out the network participation of four scholars, foregrounding several core dimensions: local and transnational, formal and informal, strong and weak, durable and temporary. Our findings suggest that strong, local, durable networks are crucial to enabling scholars’ participation in transnational networks, which support their publishing in both English and local languages. Findings contribute directly to our understandings about academic publishing in a global context and to broader debates about the efficacy of initiatives for increasing research collaboration such as those sponsored by the EU Framework Programmes. We conclude by briefly considering implications for supporting multilingual scholars’ publication and programmes aimed at increasing collaboration...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is an ethnography of aspirational mobilities emergent under {{contexts of}} profound material and social change. To explore the unprecedented expansion of educational aspirations in post market reform India, specifically surging parental desires <b>for</b> <b>English-medium</b> schooling, I conducted fieldwork at a low-fee private English-medium {{school and a}} neighboring state-funded Malayalam-medium school in the southern Indian state of Kerala. Further, to record state responses to non-elite educational aspirations, my fieldwork was distributed along diverse agencies that supported and regulated English learning in Kerala and across the country. ^ This dissertation makes two key arguments. Firstly, transitions from a previously austere socialist economy to a consumption saturated society has radically altered gendered everyday lives and unsettled entrenched social hierarchies. Negotiating these changes, non-elite mothers are reimagining possible futures for their children. Since social recognition and economic security was {{and continues to be}} entangled with higher education and English proficiencies, this has intensified desires <b>for</b> <b>English-medium</b> schooling from the earliest grades. ^ Secondly, intensifying non-elite desires for English learning reveals how educational systems in India are geared towards meeting the aspirations of privileged citizens. Analyzing the provision of English language learning in state-funded and private school systems, I argue that emergent emphases on conversational skills defines “knowing” English as predicated on the ability to socialize in English. While this shift benefits internationally mobile elite Indians, it marginalizes non-elite learning communities whose pedagogic resources are skewed towards literacy rather than orality skills. To conclude, aspirational mobilities in contemporary India are diverse and even oppositional, and dependent on aspirational locations as well as the resources that groups are able to mobilize. ...|$|R

In addition, non-native English writers seem to be having the problem in expressing their authorial identity which is needed to build one’s academic arguments. Therefore, this research was conducted to 1) explore whether linguistic disadvantage exists among native English writers or Thai writers in international publication, and 2) discover how the native English and Thai writers assert their identities through different rhetorical purposes of RAs. Eight university lecturers in Applied Linguistics (AL) from a few universities in Thailand were interviewed  to understand  their  views on the issues of  writing  for scholarly  publication  in  the  English  language. The findings revealed two salient emerging themes:  (1) the role of linguistic disadvantage and (2) variation in authorial identity between native English and Thai writers. The study has found that linguistic disadvantage exists among the Thai writers. The native English writers expressed their authorial identity overtly but the Thai writers deferred their authorial identity. It is suggested that teachers in Thailand emphasize more on the knowledge of linguistic aspect required in international publication and the effective use of linguistic realization of authorial identity in academic writing...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the implementation of}} the policy <b>for</b> <b>English-medium</b> education in government-run schools in Bhutan, a small multilingual developing country in the eastern Himalayas. It identifies factors influencing its effective implementation, plus policy and practice measures to improve learning outcomes for students. It takes as a theoretic framework an approach known as ‘content and language integrated learning’ (CLIL). This involves integration of language and subject teaching. The study addresses the following research question: How can implementation of Bhutan’s policy of English-medium education be enhanced? Data to address these questions were gathered through a literature review, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and classroom observations. The study also draws on personal experience. The findings reveal that implementation of Bhutan’s policy of English-medium government-run education could be significantly enhanced. Students are not attaining control over English at desired levels of schooling; classroom practices favour didactic teaching-learning approaches; teachers’ tend to teach toward terminal examinations and adhere to traditional teacher and student roles; and subject teachers do not consistently support students’ English language development. The study also found that many stakeholders, including policy-makers, teachers, curriculum developers and teacher trainers lack awareness of the concept of language-related disadvantage in education and approaches for more effective second language-medium teaching and learning. This includes a lack of language-sensitive classroom practices in both language and subject classes. These findings highlight the need for teachers to make different methodological choices inside classrooms. To do this, teachers should become skilled and confident in the use of classroom practices which support students’ English language learning. Key stakeholders, particularly policy-makers, teachers and teacher educators, must understand and accept the need for further policy and practice measures to support language-sensitive teaching-learning approaches <b>for</b> <b>English-medium</b> education in Bhutan. The implications of these findings for policy, practice and future research are further elucidated...|$|R

As English language teachers, we need {{to take the lead in}} designing a coherent referencing curriculum to enable our students to authoritatively quote and paraphrase so they are better equipped to achieve their academic goals. Ironically, our theoretical under-standings have far outstripped con-ventional approaches to teaching referencing. We now know, for instance, that English language learners by and large do not plagiarize deceitfully. We know that using bits and pieces of other texts may be integral to language learning. And we know that referenc-ing is tied to our ability to establish tex-tual authority. But how do we address these issues in class? Over semesters of discussion with students about the differences between their writing cultures and my U. S. academic one, I found that difficulties with referencing are con-nected to differences in how students read and write texts. In response, I developed a new approach to teaching referencing based on establishing tex-tual authority and separating writers’ voices. Because I teach composition as a theme-based course, my referencing lessons relate to theme-based reading and writing assignments. In this article, I first present a short discussion of key theoretical ideas that inform the approach, and then I describe five lessons, four of which are integrated into the course theme of “homelessness. ” There are many reasons why I use this theme.

By drawing on the concept of Communities of Practice (Lave and Wenger 1991; Wenger 1998), this thesis understands the international academic community as a community of practice. This thesis enquires the engagement of Indonesian scholars to the international academic communities through their publications in <b>English-medium</b> international <b>journals.</b> By adopting a mixed-method design as the methodological framework, which combines a questionnaire with 3 qualitative case studies, this thesis investigates the endeavour, the motives and the circumstances that affect these scholars’ ability to publish in <b>English-medium</b> international <b>journals.</b> The main findings of the study show that publication was constrained by: a.) shortages of material resources, such as online journals and; b.) lack of knowledge of specific strategies for research and the writing and publication for international journals. The strategies used include joint-publication, proofreading, and literature review research. Despite these findings most academics privileged publication in English/international journals compared to publication in national journals. Their motives were mainly scholarly recognition and career advancement rather than enriching the available theory in the disciplines. Another finding was that the participants who did achieve publication in international journals were those with active networks of overseas scholars; in particular, those engaged in joint-publication with Anglophone scholars were able to publish in higher-rank centre journals, while those who didn’t, published in regional journals in Asia. The implications of this research include the need for training in research publication strategies and the provision of material resources to support writing for international publication...|$|R

The Computational Linguistics Integrated in CALL for Irish (CLICI) research 1 presented in this dissertation aims to re-use existing CL resources and where suitable ones do not exist, to build its own modular, re-usable resources.

Irish is a compulsory subject in Irish primary schools but there are complex socio-cultural issues surrounding {{the teaching and learning}} of the language and in general CALL resources are not available for this group of learners.

The project followed a structured approach to CALL design and development, using the Analysis Design Development Implementation Evaluation (ADDIE) courseware lifecycle. The CLICI project consists of three components: a Lesson Generation Component (LGC), a Verb Conjugation Component (VCC) and a Writing Checker Component (WCC).

Besides, there is a higher elementary school for boys, an elementary school for girls, both under the control of panchayat union, and a government aided elementary school.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to create}} two corpora, one for college General English (GE) textbooks used in Taiwan, {{and the other}} <b>for</b> <b>English-medium</b> textbooks <b>for</b> business core courses, to form a basis of comparison. The operational measures for analysis involved vocabulary size, vocabulary levels (distribution among the British National Corpus 1 st– 14 th 1, 000 high-frequency word families) and text coverage. Coxhead’s (2000) Academic Word List containing 570 word families (AWL 570) was chosen {{as one of the}} base word lists. The two corpora were lexically compared using Nation and Heatley’s (2002) RANGE software. The results show that approximately 49 to 415 interdisciplinary academic words can be learned from a GE reading textbook as opposed to 421 – 537 academic words from a business textbook. The business textbooks used a smaller vocabulary than the GE textbooks (the former converging at the 4, 000 – 5, 000 word levels versus the latter spreading among the 3, 000 – 13, 000 word levels). Beyond the top 2, 000 -word level and the AWL 570, a GE textbook can supply students with 190 to 1, 327 new word families. It is hoped that the indices examined in this study will help English teachers {{to take into account the}} continuity of curriculum design while preparing General English and Business English teaching materials...|$|R

Between the early 1960s to the late 1970s, {{the number of students}} registering <b>for</b> primarily <b>English-medium</b> schools leapt from 50% to 90%, as more parents elected {{to send their children to}} English-medium schools. Attendance in Mandarin, Malay and Tamil-medium schools consequently dropped and schools began to close down. The Chinese-medium Nanyang University also made {{the switch to}} English as the medium of instruction despite meeting resistance, especially from the Chinese community.|$|R
