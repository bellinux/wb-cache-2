The visitation to cleaning stations by elasmobranchs was documented by direct observation and remote video capture at an oceanic reef in the Coral Sea and the outer Great Barrier Reef at time scales of hours to weeks. Cleaning was only observed at Osprey Reef and duration of occupancy was recorded for all elasmobranch clients. Strong tidal patterns were detected, with 49 % of sharks and 59 % of mantas engaging in cleaning interactions <b>on</b> <b>ebb</b> tides. Forty-four per cent of non-cleaned sharks were also observed <b>on</b> <b>ebb</b> tides. Some manta rays (n = 19) were individually identified through ventral skin pigmentation to determine site fidelity; three were seen more than once with repeat observations occurring within days. This was consistent among weeks and days within weeks, regardless of time of day. Hypotheses for tidal behaviour are discussed and we argue that these observations are critical in elucidating previously unknown behaviours in elasmobranch ecology.

40|$|The Peel-Harvey Estuary in {{south-western}} Australia {{became so}} eutrophic in the 1970 s and 1980 s that a radical approach was adopted {{in order to}} increase tidal exchange between this estuary and the ocean and thereby flush greater volumes of nutrients out to sea. This involved constructing a deep artificial (Dawesville) channel between the estuary and the ocean, at a location ca. 15 km south of the shallower and natural (Mandurah) channel. Samples of fish larvae were collected monthly throughout 1997 to determine whether the characteristics of the ichthyoplankton <b>on</b> flood and <b>ebb</b> tides differed within and between channels and whether they underwent the same types of intra-annual changes in the two channels. In both channels, the number of species and concentration of larvae were both significantly greater <b>on</b> flood than <b>ebb</b> tides and the species composition differed significantly between tides. The concentrations of larvae were at their greatest, by far, between early spring and early autumn. Flood and ebb tides in both channels were dominated by the goby Favonigobius lateralis, which was transported out <b>on</b> <b>ebb</b> tides as preflexion larvae and subsequently brought back on flood tides as postflexion larvae. The larvae of Hyperlophus vittatus, Pseudorhombus jenynsii and Rhabdosargus sarba, which spawn outside the estuary, were far more abundant <b>on</b> flood than <b>ebb</b> tides, whereas the reverse pertained with Atherinosoma elongata, Apogon rueppellii and Pseudogobius olorum, which spawn within the estuary. In contrast to the situation with the diversity and concentration of larvae, the species composition on both flood and ebb tides differed significantly between channels. However, the latter differences were small and mainly due to relatively greater numbers of larval F. lateralis <b>on</b> <b>ebb</b> tides in the Mandurah Channel and the very occasional occurrence of reef species on flood tides in the Dawesville Channel. During the year, the species composition underwent cyclical changes on both tides and in both channels, due to out of phase sequential monthly changes in the concentrations of certain species...|$|R
30|$|Increased tidal {{asymmetry}} {{coupled with}} wetland topography facilitated the inorganic and organic material export from Lower Beaver Pond {{in the interior}} of the wetland. During flood tide, high flows pushed water up and into the elevated region in the northern quadrat of Lower Beaver Pond. As the flood water receded, it left a pool of water that was isolated from the rest of Lower Beaver Pond by a sill, which prevented the pooled flood water from fully draining during ebb tide. The pooled flood water facilitated accumulation of inorganic material and the growth and accumulation of organic material. The pooled flood water and its accumulated inorganic and organic material was released back into the wetland during the next flood tide, when water was again pushed into the northern end of the pond and partially drained back into the wetland during ebb. The release of this pooled flood water back into the wetland produced a 40 % increase in the organic and inorganic material export from Lower Beaver Pond <b>on</b> <b>ebb</b> tide.

40|$|Most {{mangrove}} swamp/salt flat {{systems have}} tidal currents that are ebb dominated, however, some systems show only slight ebb dominance despite {{having a very}} large swamp volume relative to the creek volume. Cocoa Ck in northern Australia is such a system. Results are presented from a simple analytical model for flow in Cocoa creek together with detailed water level observations in the swamps. It {{was found that the}} primary factor reducing the ebb dominance of this system was the very low slope of the swamp surface. During rising tides, water floods as sheet flow; however, <b>on</b> <b>ebb</b> tides, the surface water slope in the swamp becomes greater than the swamp surface slope, with the result that areas of swamp closest to the main feeder creek (Cocoa Ck) dry before areas furthest from the creek. Thus, about an hour after ebb tide commences, there is a large quantity of water perched on the salt flats/mangroves, tens of centimetres higher than the water in the creek. This water cannot leave the swamp via sheet flow, but must leave through a very small and shallow creek which is also highly constricted by vegetation. This effectively increases the friction <b>on</b> <b>ebb</b> tides and results in a delay in water leaving the swamps and salt flats, reducing any tendency towards ebb dominance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Mussels and oysters are {{efficient}} filter feeds that prefer living phytoplankton {{but will}} also consume detritus when the former is in low supply. Many mussel and oyster producing {{areas of the world}} rely on external sources of phytoplankton brought into bays, sounds and estuaries from larger waterbodies on flood tides. Bivalve carrying capacity is frequently defined in terms of the biomass of cultured organisms that can optimally be maintained without depleting particular organic matter {{to the point where the}} cultures are adversely affected. This approach assumes that cultured stocks are sentinels of the health of the larger ecosystem. Water samples were collected <b>on</b> <b>ebb</b> and flood tides near the mouth of Totten Inlet to assess existing demands for phytoplankton and POM as an aid to determining the inlet’s bivalve carrying capacity.

40|$|The {{exchange}} of flow and scalars between an estuary and its perimeter controls the hydrodynamics in the estuary's fringes {{as well as}} along its axis. The flow and scalar fields in these two regions are coupled through tidally-driven lateral exchange. The physical processes that regulate this exchange operate on tidal timescales (hours, days) and respond to perturbations such as meteorological events and morphologic changes. The long-term, or residual, effects of this system of processes define the physical and ecological functioning of an estuary by controlling its morphology, salt field, and distribution of flows. In this dissertation research, field observations and theoretical analysis are used to {{explore the influence of}} an estuary's exchange with its perimeter on flow and scalar fields at tidal and residual timescales. In-situ measurements of flow velocity and water properties were collected in a macrotidal slough in the South San Francisco Bay lined by mudflats and recently connected to former salt ponds. The interplay between tidal flows, bathymetry, and the longitudinal salt gradient define the pattern of stratification and mixing during a tidal cycle. The mechanism of tidal straining combined with the longitudinal baroclinic pressure gradient typically work together to enhance stratification <b>on</b> <b>ebb</b> tides and break it down through active mixing on flood tides. In the presence of sharp bathymetric transitions, such as the shoal-channel interface, the typical dynamics can be overwhelmed by local exchange. On flood tides, baroclinically-driven lateral circulation between the channel and mudflats freshens the surface layer in the channel, and reduces its velocity, producing a sub-surface velocity maximum. The input of buoyancy and the velocity shear result in stable stratification. <b>On</b> <b>ebb</b> tides, outflow from the mudflats transports trapped, high-salinity water over the freshening bottom layer, producing strong lateral shear and unstable stratification near the channel-mudflat boundary. As the ebb tide progresses and the mudflat outflow decelerates, the water column becomes well-mixed, and exhibits increased turbulent motions that result from shear and buoyant production. In short, lateral exchange in this tidal channel has reversed the classical pattern of stratification at the mudflat-channel boundary. The transport of suspended sediment through an estuary is determined by an intricate system of physical, biological, and chemical processes. The physical transport dynamics are sometimes described by a balance of particle settling and turbulent resuspension, but in a tidal channel that exchanges with a complex perimeter, this balance is overly simple. Along the channel's axis, resuspension is the main mechanism elevating suspended sediment concentrations on the flood, and particle settling reduces concentrations when slack tide arrives. <b>On</b> the <b>ebb,</b> horizontal advection results in quickly recovering concentrations of sediment before turbulent stresses increase enough to suspend material from the bed. Tidal asymmetries reflect the role of the settling and scour lags, and make this balance an unsteady one where the net transport is landward. The tidal asymmetry reverses and increases in magnitude in response to wet weather as newly deposited material works its way down-estuary <b>on</b> successive <b>ebb</b> tides. In the presence of irregular bathymetry, such as near the channel-mudflat boundary and inside a breached salt pond, much of the sediment deposited in the shallows cannot be resuspended <b>on</b> the <b>ebb</b> due to strong friction opposing tidal forcing, resulting in net deposition. The combination of low concentrations of suspended sediment in the shallows <b>on</b> <b>ebb</b> tides with bathymetrically generated shear in local velocities produces the periodic occurrence of high sediment concentrations near the water surface and low concentrations near the bed. This establishes the importance of the role of lateral advection <b>on</b> <b>ebb</b> tides. The presence of complex bathymetry therefore requires that horizontal advection and unsteadiness be accounted for when describing the mechanisms driving transport of suspended sediment. Understanding dispersion of scalars, such as salt and sediment, in an estuary over long timescales is critical for estuarine physics as well as managing the influence of humans on the environment. An irregular shoreline and accompanying bathymetry result in tidal trapping, a dispersive mechanism that arises from differences in phasing of flow velocities and scalar concentrations between the estuary's axis and its perimeter, as well as the variations in mixing between these regions. Classical theories describing the residual effects of tidal trapping assume that exchange between the estuary and perimeter is diffusive, but this framework neglects the role of tidal advection, such as the filling and draining of side-embayments, and the branching of flows into channel networks. A new theoretical framework is developed to represent estuarine dispersion from tidal trapping driven by advective exchange. The new advective framework compares well to observations...|$|R
