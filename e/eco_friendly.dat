40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} {{work is to}} {{investigate}} new nanostructured materials, obtained by the electrospinning technique, in order to design 3 D arrangement of the electrodes, leading thus to improve the energy efficiency of energy production devices, such as microbial fuel cells (MFCs). The carbon nanofibers reveal {{to be the most}} promising material in the field of bio electrochemistry; in fact, up to now the best performing microbial fuel cells are fabricated using carbon and carbon based material electrodes. To further enhance the performances of bio anodes and bio cathodes, a set of properties are then required to be overcome, such as a proper surface morphology and chemistry, good biofilm adhesion and electron transfer, and a good electrical conductivity. This work aims to demonstrate that the electrospun nanofibers own all the necessary properties, revealing themselves as the most innovative and promising structures for anodes and cathodes for microbial fuel cells. The nanofibers ensure all the properties listed above; in particular, during my Ph. D. I have investigated and studied the carbon based nanofibers to be applied as cathode and as anode in these kind of the devices. In this thesis, it will be demonstrated that the nanostructured electrodes improve the efficiency devices thanks both to the low impedance and to the interaction with the microorganisms. The high micrometric porosity characteristics of the realized anodic material create the ideal habitat for the microorganism's proliferation. Moreover, different solution for the cathode material have been developed using ceramic nanofibers, such as MnxOy nanofibers and carbon nanofibers, in order to improve the performance of the devices. The layer made of these nanofibers, in fact, catalyzes the oxygen reduction reaction if the oxygen is used as terminal electron acceptor in the devices; thus these catalysts can substitute the platinum layer, which is the most used today, granting a cheaper and <b>eco</b> <b>friendlier</b> material...|$|R

The problem of this technique might be the right choice of microorganism able to grow and produce at low water activity. This work is a pilot study of three red yeast strains – Rhodotorula glutinis, Cystofilobasidium capitatum and Sporobomomyces roseus cultivated by semi-solid state fermentation (semi-SSF). Yeasts were cultivated in series of production media with gradual reduction of cultivation water content. Pasta and hydrolyzed pasta were used as source of sacharides, glucose served as the carbon source in control media. All studied strains we able to grow and produce observed lipidic metabolites also at low water contents. Production of carotenoids and sterols was higher in semi-solid media. Cystofilobasidium capitatum strain was identified as the best producer of carotenoids and biomass. This strain was cultivated on hydrolyzed pasta media with 40 % water content.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 76 - 87). Huge energy {{demand in the}} world has caused depletion in non - renewable energy sources, and global climate change due to the consumed fuel exhausts. Renewable energy sources are <b>eco</b> - <b>friendly</b> alternatives. Electrochemical energy storage systems (EESS) are useful tools to store the energy, which is harvested from the renewable sources. Lithium - ion batteries are currently the most popular EESS owing to their several advantages over other systems. However, for their use in high energy demanding applications like electric vehicles, new electrode materials with higher capacities are required. Here, we demonstrate two anode materials with high capacities, aluminum and silicon. We address problems regarding their commercial applications and offer solutions. To improve the properties of aluminum, we fabricate aluminum - copper thin films via sputtering, then we apply age hardening to the alloy. We observe that age hardening indeed increase stability of aluminum anodes. In the second work, we synthesize silicon nanoparticles via laser ablation, whose sizes are smaller than 20 nm, and embed them into carbon nanofibers (CNFs) via electrospinning. The electrochemical battery tests are conducted with only CNFs, CNFs with commercial Si nanoparticles and CNFs with laser ablased Si nanoparticles. The cyclic stability of these composites are observed along with their rate capabilities. by Ömer Ulaş Kudu. M. S...|$|R
40|$|Weed {{competition}} causes {{significant damage}} (up to 90 %) to crop yields. Weed control through chemical {{means in the}} form of herbicide is commonly used to kill weeds or inhibit their growth throughout the world. However, the use of herbicides has increased toxic residues dangerously, indiscriminately targeting organisms, the environment, and ground water and creating serious upheaval in the ecosystem. Studies were conducted through a series of experiments for five consecutive wet seasons with a variety of alternative biological solutions to control the weeds. These solutions are benign, harmless, pollution free, non - hazardous and <b>eco</b> - <b>friendly</b> and control the pre-emergence of weeds in the rain-fed, upland rice ecosystem whereas in the high rainfall coastal region of eastern India, control was effected through soil solarization. This is a method of heating the soil's surface by using transparent low-density polyethylene (LDPE film) sheets placed on the soil's surface to trap solar radiation. This raises the soil temperature to a level which is lethal for many soil borne pathogens and weed seeds, thus killing weeds before they even begin to grow. The rise in soil temperature due to solarization by using LDPE film was significantly correlated to the soil temperature under normal conditions (uncovered) and the cumulative solar radiation (Wm- 2) of that day but the effect of the air temperature was found to be insignificant. A quadratic relationship was developed between temperature difference (DT) and soil temperature (ST) and the cumulative solar radiation (SR) for that day. The use of transparent and black LDPE sheets reduces weed growth and increases rice yield. Higher yields were found in treatments using transparent LDPE films of 200 gauges and 400 gauges for 30 days followed by black LDPE film. However, lower yields were recorded from the fields which were covered with LDPE films (both 200 and 400 gauge) beyond 30 days...|$|R

One of the simplest and most direct applications of this energy is the conversion of solar radiation into heat, {{which can be used}} in water heating systems. A commonly used solar collector is the flat-plate. A lot of research has been conducted in order to analyse the flat-plate operation and improve its efficiency. Conventional methods of water heating with hot plates, gas burners, paraffin stoves, sawdust cookers, coal burners, firewood burners release C 02 into the atmosphere and other pollutants. This study presents an alternative way of heating water using solar radiation thus optimizing fully the solar renewable energy which is <b>eco</b> - <b>friendly.</b> Ogun State in Nigeria was used ss a case study. The solar radiation for the state was explored with an annual average of 4. 775 kWhlm 2 /day recorded. The designed system comprised storage tanks (Inlet and Outlet) and the collector unit which comprises wooden casing (35. 375 x 17. 25 cm), copper tube (9 meters long and 0. 5 mm in diameter), and aluminium foil (33 x 17 cm).

40|$|The {{persistent}} {{demand for}} sustainable and <b>eco</b> – <b>friendly</b> fibres {{able to achieve}} high performance materials drew the attention to bast fibres, which, in this regard, represent an attractive resource. They are characterised by their fineness, flexibility, and excellent tensile properties due to the cellulose volume fraction. In particular, the fibre of the Himalayan giant nettle plant (Girardinia diversifolia), which grows in Africa and Asia, simultaneously provides social and environmental benefits as well as attractive physical properties, making it an interesting fibre for high performance sustainable textiles. This research provides an unprecedented investigation on giant Himalayan nettle fibres, currently processed and used in the handicraft, performed in parallel with common European nettle fibre (Urtica dioica) already used in the textile industry. The morphological, physical, and mechanical characterisation of G. diversifolia fibres provide encouraging results, indicating a substantial superiority (in terms of physical and mechanical properties) of Himalayan nettle fibres compared to the most common textile bast fibres. Himalayan nettle fibres displayed higher tensile strength, tensile modulus, and elongation at break with respect to European nettle fibres. Furthermore, the Himalayan nettle fibre is the longest bast fibre known so far. Its moisture content results indicate effective dielectric insulating capacity. The values of moisture regain, inferior to cotton, show that the fibre physical characteristics are not affect by humidity. Treatment with increasing concentrations of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) {{was carried out in}} order to induce changes in the molecular structure, from Cellulose I to Cellulose II, of both Himalayan and European nettle fibres, and to assess how this variation could influence their physical and mechanical characteristics. This research has identified as best result the fibre versatility: the ability to obtain, with alkaline treatment, characteristics of the fibre able to meet different purposes. To make the fibre attractive for the textile industry, Himalayan nettle fibre has to be competitive demonstrating that it can work in technical textiles. The field of outdoor sportswear, where a high level of comfort is required, has been chosen to demonstrate the performance of the Himalayan nettle fibre hypothesising a multilayer fabric made of three Himalayan nettle nonwovens treated at three different concentrations of NaOH. Based on its superior fibre length and mechanical strength, Himalayan giant nettle fibre could be a very promising material for advanced nonwovens where high – performance materials are required...|$|R

The traditional lecture method had dominated it and therefore students had little involvement in the teaching and learning process. The study employed ideas from a Qualitative research design and an Action Research approach. Through action research, the concerned parties were able to participate actively and to evaluate the processes and experiences through reflections done at the end of every phase of the project. Eight Students of the certificate class of 2015 September intake and two (2) instructors in the pastry and bakery department participated in all aspects of the project to recycle organic kitchen refuse into briquettes. Interviews, observations and logs were the data collection tools used. From the data collected, participants appreciated the idea of learning through projects especially recycling organic kitchen refuse to make briquettes since briquette making improves the ecosystem and saves the trees. Briquettes are <b>eco</b> and healthy <b>friendly</b> since they do not produce smoke as they burn. During the project, learners worked as a group, shared responsibilities under their student leadership. Students also reviewed their own, colleagues and teachers’ roles in class. After receiving critiques, students were able to improve their work. Students also had an opportunity to evaluate the work of the teachers. This was in terms of their activity in class and ability to let students work on their own. Because of the experiences and reflections got from the project, it is necessary to note that involving learners in the teaching and learning process is necessary for effective learning. There is also need to consider learners’ prior knowledge before introducing new knowledge. This therefore means that the teaching and learning environment should have qualities that encourage learners to own, be responsible and appreciate their learning...|$|R
