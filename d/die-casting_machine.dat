40|$|Abstract. Mo 2 FeB 2 boride base cermets {{produced}} by a novel sintering technique, called reaction boronizing sintering through a liquid phase, have excellent mechanical properties and wear and corrosion-resistances. Hence, the cermets are applied to the injection molding <b>die-casting</b> <b>machine</b> parts and so on. Metal injection molding (MIM) is a suitable processing route for the mass production of complex shaped and high performance components. In general, {{it is difficult for}} the liquid phase sintered materials to be applied to the injection molding process because significant shrinkage and deformation occur during sintering. In this study, the MIM process was applied in the production of Mo 2 FeB 2 boride base cermets parts. We investigated that the effect of deoxidization and sintering temperature on mechanical properties and deformation of the cermets. As a result, deoxidization temperature of 1323 K and sintering temperature of 1518 K were suitable. The MIM products of the cermets showed allowable dimensional accuracy and the same mechanical properties as the press-sintered...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, the die-filling {{process in}} {{pressure}} die-casting {{is divided into}} three stages. This paper initiates the concept of a 'five-stage' process for one-shot pressure die-casting processes. The concept of a 'five-stage' process retains the familiar first and second stages, breaks down the third stage into two and adds a fifth 'residual stage'. It is shown that the maximum metal pressure developed {{at the end of the}} fourth stage represents the compressibility of the molten metal and the hydraulic oil. Equations for the dynamic pressures during the fourth stage are derived. There is still a lack of information on the bulk modulus of various molten metals. From the equations derived, an experimental method for the determination of the bulk modulus of molten metal is suggested.

40|$|The {{target of}} this project is to develop and test a local {{composite}} material allowing the material properties of aluminum housing in the bearing area to be harmonized with the thermal expansion behaviour of the drive shaft. By providing the bedplates with infiltrated ceramic hybrid preforms in the bearing area the integral expansion behaviour of the casting could be clearly reduced in comparison with conventional all-aluminum solutions. The efficiency of the composite material has been confirmed in various engine and non-engine tests. The fatigue investigations carried out using Porsche's typical test loads for high-performance engines yielded very successful results. First vehicle tests are going on without any problems. The infiltration of the composite material was done by squeeze casting. With the help of real-time-controlled <b>die-casting</b> <b>machines</b> {{it is possible to}} produce complete bedplates. The new composite materials result in increased tool wear during machining. This project has successfully demonstrated the basic feasibility of a local composite material for use in the crankshaft main bearing area.

40|$|Alloys of a {{specific}} microstructure exhibit a shear-rate history-dependent flow behaviour in the semi-solid state. Rheological studies {{have been carried out}} using various experimental techniques such as concentric cylinder rheometers of Couette or Searle type as well as capillary rheometers and parallel plate compression tests. With the Searle type rheometer and the capillary rheometer two different approaches of rheological measurement techniques are discussed and compared regarding advantages, potentials and its distinct characteristics. Experiments using the Searle type rheometer have been conducted under steady-state or oscillating conditions and have been used to verify time-dependency of step responses due to discontinuous or linear variances of the shear rate. These experiments provide all types of flow curve parameters as implemented in the numerical simulation. However the variances of the commonly used Couette and Searle type rheometers are limited to shear-rates which are significantly lower than that appearing in the technical thixo- or rheocasting processes. For that reason an additional experimental set-up with a horizontal slot capillary integrated in a shot-controlled high-pressure <b>die-casting</b> <b>machine</b> is used in order to examine flow properties at shear rate conditions similar to those in real thixocastin...|$|E

40|$|Shot sleeve is a {{very easily}} worn out part in a {{high-pressure}} <b>die-casting</b> <b>machine</b> due to serious dissolution of the area underneath the pouring hole. It is because during a normal pouring process, the high temperature molten aluminum will impact and dissolve that area of the shot sleeve by complex chemical and physical process. Rotation experiment was carried out to H 13 and four kinds of refractory metal samples. SEM and EDS pictures were taken in order to investigate the microstructure and the dissolution mechanism of these materials. This suggests a high strength niobium is an ideal material for that area of a shot sleeve. Comparison among the tested samples were conducted to suggest a better material than H 13 for shot sleeve. The result shows that niobium is the best dissolution resistance material in all the tested materials. Titanium is the worst one in all the refractory materials though, it is still 9 times better than H 13. A three-stage dissolution theory is proposed including reaction, washout and diffusion stage. The washout and diffusion stage are when the weight loss occurred significantly.

40|$|Molten metal {{processing}} is inherently energy intensive and roughly 25 % {{of the cost}} of die-cast products can be traced to some form of energy consumption [1]. The obvious major energy requirements are for melting and holding molten alloy in preparation for casting. The proper selection and maintenance of melting and holding equipment are clearly important factors in minimizing energy consumption in die-casting operations [2]. In addition to energy consumption, furnace selection also influences metal loss due to oxidation, metal quality, and maintenance requirements. Other important factors influencing energy consumption in a die-casting facility include geographic location, alloy(s) cast, starting form of alloy (solid or liquid), overall process flow, casting yield, scrap rate, cycle times, number of shifts per day, days of operation per month, type and size of die-casting form of alloy (solid or liquid), overall process flow, casting yield, scrap rate, cycle times, number of shifts per day, days of operation per month, type and size of <b>die-casting</b> <b>machine,</b> related equipment (robots, trim presses), and downstream processing (machining, plating, assembly, etc.).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study of the}} flow of molten metal in the shot sleeve of horizontal high-pressure <b>die-casting</b> <b>machines</b> during the injection process. The analysis of the wave of molten metal created by plunger motion can be of help in reducing porosity in manufactured parts caused by entrapment in the molten metal of a certain amount of the initial air in the die cavity and in the shot sleeve. The amount of trapped air can be reduced by selecting appropriate operating conditions during the injection process, which are mainly determined by the law of plunger motion, the initial shot sleeve filling fraction, and the geometrical characteristics of the shot sleeve. The proposed model, which considers the problem as two-dimensional, is based on the conservation equations of mass and momentum, and treats the free surface using a capturing method (Scalar Equation Method). Surface tension and solidification effects are neglected. Different approaches are considered to simulate plunger motion, in which either the plunger surface or the end wall of the sleeve moves and contracts a Cartesian grid. In the second case, a horizontal body force per unit mass is introduced and the plunger is assumed to be at rest. When numerical results for the wave profile were compared with those obtained using an analytical model based on the shallow-water approximation, and also with numerical results obtained from a CFD code specifically designed for free-surface flow modeling, a good degree of agreement was found.
