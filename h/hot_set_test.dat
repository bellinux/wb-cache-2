The studied property presents non linear variations according to the aging time under high temperatures. So {{it is very difficult}} to find a theoretical or experimental model of the properties evolution under thermal aging. For that reason, several factors have been considered such as aging time and applied temperature. The obtained results are very encouraging and pointed out that the fuzzy logic is a powerful tool to predict the insulation proprieties. In other words, the obtained results are in good accordance with the experimental results with an acceptable error margin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Resource-constrained mobile devices pose a {{challenge}} to the design of security mechanisms. Existing host-based malware detection solutions are often resource-intensive. We present a decentralized and resource-aware malware detection architecture for mobile devices. Our approach leverages two key ideas: social collaboration and the concept of a <b>hot</b> <b>set.</b> The <b>hot</b> <b>set</b> concept states that not all malware signatures are equally important. At any given time, some signatures (the <b>hot</b> <b>set)</b> {{are more likely to be}} matched than the others. We leverage this concept by only keeping the <b>hot</b> <b>set</b> of signatures in the main memory of a mobile device, and distributing the whole signature database among devices belonging to the social group of the device owner. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by implementing a proof-of-concept (Social-AV) based on an open source anti-malware software, ClamAV. Experiments show that Social-AV reduces the memory consumption to about 55 % of the amount consumed by ClamAV, while retaining the same detection capability.

40|$|A grand {{challenge}} of distributed query processing is {{to devise a}} self-organizing architecture which exploits all hardware resources optimally to manage the database <b>hot</b> <b>set,</b> minimize query response time, and maximize throughput without single point global coordination. The Data Cyclotron architecture [Goncalves and Kersten 2010] addresses this challenge using turbulent data movement through a storage ring built from distributed main memory and capitalizing on the functionality offered by modern remote-DMA network facilities. Queries assigned to individual nodes interact with the storage ring by picking up data fragments, which are continuously flowing around, that is, the <b>hot</b> <b>set.</b> The storage ring is steered by the Level Of Interest (LOI) attached to each data fragment, which represents the cumulative query interest as it passes around the ring multiple times. A fragment with LOI below a given threshold, inversely proportional to the ring load, is pulled out to free up resources. This threshold is dynamically adjusted in a fully distributed manner based on ring characteristics and locally observed query behavior. It optimizes resource utilization by keeping the average data access latency low. The approach is illustrated using an extensive and validated simulation study. The results underpin the fragment <b>hot</b> <b>set</b> management robustness in turbulent workload scenarios. A fully functional prototype of the proposed architecture has been implemented using modest extensions to MonetDB and runs within a multirack cluster equipped with Infiniband. Extensive experimentation using both microbenchmarks and high-volume workloads based on TPC-H demonstrates its feasibility.

40|$|Gene <b>set</b> <b>testing</b> {{has become}} an {{indispensable}} tool {{for the analysis of}} high-dimensional genomic data. An important motivation for <b>testing</b> gene <b>sets,</b> rather than individual genomic variables, is to improve statistical power by reducing the number of tested hypotheses. Given the dramatic growth in common gene <b>set</b> collections, however, <b>testing</b> is often performed with nearly as many gene sets as underlying genomic variables. To address the challenge to statistical power posed by large gene set collections, we have developed spectral gene set filtering (SGSF), a novel technique for independent filtering of gene set collections prior to gene <b>set</b> <b>testing.</b> The SGSF method uses as a filter statistic the p-value measuring the statistical significance of the association between each gene set and the sample principal components (PCs), taking into account the significance of the associated eigenvalues. Because this filter statistic is independent of standard gene <b>set</b> <b>test</b> statistics under the null hypothesis but dependent under the alternative, the proportion of enriched gene sets is increased without impacting the type I error rate.

40|$|Background: Analysis of {{microarray}} experiments {{often involves}} testing for the overrepresentation of pre-defined sets of genes among lists of genes deemed individually significant. Most popular gene <b>set</b> <b>testing</b> methods assume {{the independence of}} genes within each set, an assumption that is seriously violated, as extensive correlation between genes is a well-documented phenomenon. Results: We conducted a meta-analysis of over 200 datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus in order to demonstrate the practical impact of strong gene correlation patterns that are highly consistent across experiments. We show that a common independence assumption-based gene <b>set</b> <b>testing</b> procedure produces very high false positive rates when applied to data sets for which treatment groups have been randomized, and that gene sets with high internal correlation {{are more likely to}} be declared significant. A reanalysis of the same datasets using an array resampling approach properly controls false positive rates, leading to more parsimonious and highconfidence gene set findings, which should facilitate pathway-based interpretation of the microarray data. Conclusions: These findings call into question many of the gene <b>set</b> <b>testing</b> results in the literature and argue strongly for the adoption of resampling based gene <b>set</b> <b>testing</b> criteria in the peer reviewed biomedical literature.

40|$|In speech audiometry, one of {{the main}} goals is to {{determine}} speech discrimination. This is done to find out how well a person can discriminate between the different sounds that make up speech. There are several tests that have been created to test the speech discrimination ability of people. Most of the tests consist of a list of monosyllable words. The testing itself is relatively simple; the tester says a word, and the client must repeat what he hears. The beginning of World War II gave impetus to the study of speech in many institutions (Goetzinger, 1978). Many of the speech lists that were developed contained words that were selected for testing adult clients. This put children at a disadvantage when speech testing using these lists was performed. According to Rintelmann (1979), children do not approximate adult scores until 12 years of age. Because of this, there was a need to develop speech discrimination test lists for children under the lists of phonetically balanced words that were selected from the spoken vocabulary of kindergarteners. These words were called PBK- 50 words, and they were considered to be within the vocabulary of children who are six years of age or older. The PBK- 50 word lists were used as a test where the tester says a word, and the child repeats the word that he/she hears. The word that the child says, however, usually comes from the child's own particular set of expressive vocabulary words. Each child's expressive vocabulary iswords. This large set of words is considered to be an open-response set limited to the words which the child being <b>tested</b> knows. This <b>set</b> could be vast if the child knows and can say numerous words. What word the child repeats to the tester could be any one of a very large set ofSome researchers (Ross and Lerman, 1970; Martin, 1978) claim that verbal responses, which are used in open-response sets, may be limited by the child's language disorder, articulation defect, motivation, or a number of other factors. To bypass all of the difficulties involved with verbal responses, picture-pointing closed-response <b>set</b> <b>tests</b> were developed for young children. A closed-response set is where the client must choose his answer from a small number of choices. The set of words or pictures which are given to the client to choose from are predetermined by the creator of the set. Because answer choices are given to the client, it is assumed that there is a higher probability of guessing correctly than with an open-response <b>set</b> <b>test.</b> The guess factor on the closed-response <b>set</b> <b>test</b> {{is directly related to the}} number of responses given to choose from. The closed-response <b>set</b> <b>tests</b> are generally thought to be easier than open-response <b>set</b> <b>tests</b> (Hodgson, 1978). This is most likely due to the fact that more cues are given in the closed-response <b>set</b> <b>tests.</b> Not only does the client have a small number of words or pictures to choose from in a closed-response set, he also has the advantage of seeing the words or pictures before the tester says a word. Seeing the pictures may give the client clues not available in open-response tests. A possible problem with the closed-response <b>set</b> <b>tests</b> is that they may be testing more than speech discrimination. They may also be testing the child's ability to be able to recognize the picture that represents the word given by the examiner. Also, it is not at all clear if the echolalic type response required in an open <b>set</b> <b>test</b> is testing the same thing as a picture pointing task used in a closed <b>set</b> <b>test.</b> It appears that closed-response <b>set</b> <b>tests</b> are easier tasks for children. However, open-response <b>set</b> <b>tests</b> may be more appropriate for speech discrimination testing. It would seem appropriate to do a speech discrimination test using the same test in an open-response and in a closed-response set condition to find out if these two conditions are comparable in testing a child's speech discrimination ability. At the present time, the author knows of only one study (Hodgson, 1973) which has been performed comparing these two conditions using the same test. This indicates a need for further research into open-response versus closed-response <b>set</b> <b>testing</b> with young children. This study is an attempt to find out how well four year old children with normal hearing perform using an open-response set as compared to a closed-response set using the same test. Thesis (M.
