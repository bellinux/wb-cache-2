30|$|We {{employ a}} 6 -month rolling {{estimation}} window for parameter estimations and construct portfolios on a sub-sample periodical basis. To obtain the portfolio for <b>January</b> 2006 <b>to</b> December 2008, we use <b>January</b> 2003 <b>to</b> December 2005 data {{to construct the}} initial positions via the classical Roy safety-first optimization problem. For <b>January</b> 2009 <b>to</b> December 2011, we set the portfolio weights from <b>January</b> 2006 <b>to</b> December 2008 as initial positions. We then set the portfolio weights from <b>January</b> 2009 <b>to</b> December 2011 as initial positions to construct portfolios for <b>January</b> 2012 <b>to</b> December 2015. To reflect the true risk of the portfolio, we use <b>January</b> 2006 <b>to</b> December 2008 data as initial positions via the classical Roy safety-first optimization problem to construct portfolios for <b>January</b> 2009 <b>to</b> December 2015. Portfolio revision is made {{on a monthly basis}} since in reality they are related to low transaction, management and monitoring costs.|$|R
