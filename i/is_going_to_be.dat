5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea of who <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house.

40|$|The <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Ving {{construction}} occurs only 36 {{times in}} the 1, 000, 000 -word Great Britain component of the ICE corpus. Yet, its context of use <b>is</b> multifaceted. The <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> part may express intentionality (“When you go <b>to</b> Italy <b>are</b> you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing art”), expectation/probability (“And these little cartilages at the back actually move the vocal folds when they <b>'re</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> vibrating”) or something in between these two notions (“Could you just play the notes that I <b>'m</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing”). The be Ving part may encode a durative event (“You <b>'re</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transcribing all of this <b>are</b> you”; “are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> eating at your parents’ or here”), a repeated event (“And I said well I think Rebecca <b>'s</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> into her M Phil lectures”) or a punctual event (“And I <b>was</b> just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> telling people what <b>to</b> do which <b>was</b> fine”). This construction does not necessaritly express the notion of ‘progressive aspect’, as it may also encode non-durative events. Corpus data reveal that it is half as frequent as the will <b>be</b> Ving <b>to</b> future, occurs only in spoken data, and is typically associated with pronominal subjects denoting human agents...|$|R
5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators {{have to deal}} with a world that is {{interactive}} and unpredictable.

To solve this issue, the system relies on certain rules or artificial intelligence to select the most appropriate shots.|$|E

In contrast to this, Kubo has found he liked Rukia more in the illustrations in which her face expresses pain such as when she <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> executed in the manga.|$|E

Sailor Neptune <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a deep sleep {{at the end of}} the world, and Sailor Uranus would have had to steal the talismans from the Sailor Soldiers to revive her. However, both Ikuhara and producer Iriya Azuma left the series. Ikuhara's concepts were later used in Revolutionary Girl Utena.|$|R

He's not medically cleared, Mack has to go in and sort of change the medical records so that Jonas can keep on [...] We had a whole thing planned, it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good." [...] Jonas would eventually leave the army due to his injuries coupled with combat stress and reunite with Molly. Mack would take over the team but at the end of the series would also leave for a training post after Tiffy becomes pregnant with their third child. Bob would be badly injured in a parachuting accident and join the CIA as their Unit liaison. Ryan would take a demotion to regain control of The Unit whilst Bridget Sullivan would be killed on a mission halfway through the season. Charles Grey would take over as team leader with Sam McBride as his deputy training replacements for the personnel they have lost.|$|R

5|$|Unemployment {{had more}} than tripled by late November 2008, with over 7000 {{registered}} jobseekers (about 4% of the workforce) compared to just 2136 {{at the end of}} August 2008. As 80% of household debt is indexed and another 13% denominated in foreign currencies, debt payment <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more costly. Since October 2008, 14% of the workforce have experienced reductions in pay, and around 7% have had their working hours reduced.

5|$|Abi {{discovers that}} Ian's {{restaurant}} {{is on fire}} and goes inside to find Jane in a corridor on the floor struggling to breathe. A pipe falls onto Abi, knocking her unconscious, but Max and Steven soon find her and drag her out. She is taken to hospital with Lauren by her side in the ambulance. At the hospital Abi tells Steven he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a father. Steven declares his love for her and makes a promise that he will make their relationship work. Steven then goes into cardiac arrest and dies after being injured in the fire leaving Abi devastated. In an attempt to console Lauren but also partly out of jealousy that Lauren is getting all the attention, Abi tries to tell Lauren about her pregnancy, but Lauren angrily mistakes this as gloating about her own abortion. Upset at the accusation, Abi says that she wishes Lauren died instead and that she never deserved Steven. Abi attends Steven's funeral as sole mourner and declares her love. Unable to cope with Steven's death, Abi decides to leave Walford to visit Tanya in Devon, taking Steven's ashes with her. When Lauren finds out that Abi is leaving, she asks if she and Louie can come with her. Abi agrees and they leave Walford together.|$|E

5|$|For the {{construction}} of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce the noise levels in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and neoprene pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change that <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have the ceilings lined with absorbent fiberglass or mineral wool that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders. The Second Avenue Subway has the first stations to test this technology.|$|E
5|$|Lisa imagines she and all {{the other}} Springfield Elementary {{students}} are Hebrews in ancient Egypt, with the Pharaoh (Principal Skinner) making them build a pyramid. Only Moses (Milhouse) can liberate the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, supposedly incited by the burning bush, he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the sea, Lisa has an idea to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets to drain the sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, but the water fills the sea back up and swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, and then return to the shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if it <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many centuries, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna.|$|E
5|$|The Tamil text Sri Venkatachala Mahatyam relates Maya Sita to Vedavati, but {{her next}} birth is Padmavati, not Draupadi. After Ravana tries to molest Vedavati, she curses {{him that she}} would destroy his clan. She seeks the {{protection}} of Agni. Agni consoles her and gives her not only shelter but also {{the opportunity to take}} her vengeance. He disguises Vedavati as Sita, who <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> kidnapped by Ravana and hides the real Sita in his refuge. At the time of Agni Pariksha, Vedavati enters the fire and Agni accompanies Sita and Vedavati out in public. Rama is perplexed seeing the two Sitas. The real Sita informs Rama that Vedavati was abducted in her place and suffered the incarceration in Lanka. She demands Rama to marry Vedavati, however Rama refuses citing his vow to have only one wife in this birth. He promises that in Kali yuga (the present and final age), when he appear on earth as Venkateshwara, Vedavati will be born as Padmavati, whom he will marry. Unlike Sanskrit texts, Agni plans the whole thing and Sita conspires with him to protect herself, but also safeguards the surrogate Sita's interests.|$|E
