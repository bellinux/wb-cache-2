In October 1835 a Mr. Clark from Cobourg tipped {{out of the}} bark canoe ferrying him to Glenora and was buried without an inquest; a year earlier, a Rev. Mathew Miller from Cobourg had drowned after <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> February ice. The road itself was no better, barely adequate for horse and rider but unfit to run stagecoach lines.|$|E

General de Gaulle married Yvonne Vendroux on 6 April 1921 at the cathedral. The building experienced extensive damage during World War II, and was partially rebuilt, {{although much of the}} old altar and furnishings were not replaced.|$|E

5|$|Howard gets a {{call from}} her sister, who has {{recently}} found a tumor on her breast. The sister has just learned her husband has been having an affair. Although Howard is initially hesitant to confide in Felton, he eventually surprises her by offering genuine words of comfort. A drunken man dressed as Santa Claus (Cleve Wall) is arrested for threatening his wife and {{a crowd of people}} with a water pistol. Later, the detectives get a call that Santa Claus has escaped from custody in the department, and he is found after <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ceiling and landing on Munch's desk. Meanwhile, Pembleton and Bayliss discuss the Watson murder scene. Bayliss insists he has already gone over the information repeatedly, but Pembleton tells him he needs to think outside the box and approach it with from the mind-frame of a criminal. Later, Bayliss reexamines the information and realizes the killer brought Watson down a fire escape, offering a new lead in the case. As the new day dawns, Gee has the detectives assemble on the roof so he can spray them with a garden hose to cool them off.|$|E
25|$|The show opening {{features}} a truck <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ice. While real accidents with fatal outcomes might be mentioned, {{the show has}} never featured them and indeed, the show opening is a miniature model filmed inside a studio. A season 1 rumor that the sequence was staged using a real truck and dynamite caused discontent among the drivers.|$|E
25|$|Animal aerial {{locomotion}} can {{be divided}} into two categories—powered and unpowered. In unpowered modes of locomotion, the animal uses aerodynamics forces exerted on the body due to wind or <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> air. In powered flight, the animal uses muscular power to generate aerodynamic forces. Animals using unpowered aerial locomotion cannot maintain altitude and speed due to unopposed drag, while animals using powered flight can maintain steady, level flight as long as their muscles are capable of doing so.|$|E

25|$|As {{the siege}} {{took place in}} winter, the besiegers and besieged {{suffered}} severely from the cold weather. The city canal and Vledder Aa froze over several times, causing problems, such as soldiers and guns <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ice while attempting to cross. A surprise sally on January 24 by Norreys and his men proved decisive. They captured equipment, broke up many of the Spanish siege guns, and inflicted casualties of nearly 400 men (most of whom were captured).|$|E

Next morning, Baxter is fired from his job, and Eve finds the flowerpot empty at Psmith's cottage. Enlisting Freddie's help, she searches the place, but finds nothing; Psmith enters and explains his motives, his friendship with Mike and Phyllis. Cootes and Peavey appear, armed, and threaten to escape with the necklace, but Psmith takes advantage of Freddie's leg <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ceiling to overpower Cootes and retrieve the jewels.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} {{modelling}} a real world problem using differential equations is {{the determination of}} the velocity of a ball <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> air, considering only gravity and air resistance. The ball's acceleration towards the ground is the acceleration due to gravity minus the acceleration due to air resistance. Gravity is considered constant, and air resistance may be modeled as proportional to the ball's velocity. This means that the ball's acceleration, which is a derivative of its velocity, depends on the velocity (and the velocity depends on time). Finding the velocity as a function of time involves solving a differential equation and verifying its validity.|$|E
25|$|Belt press- This press {{utilizes}} {{a series}} of air-inflated pads along a wire mesh belt. Usually several meters long, fresh grapes are loaded onto {{the beginning of the}} belt where it is transferred by rollers through the series of pads that apply pressure, hold it for a time and release with the juice <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> screens into waiting press pans. Belt presses have been used by high volume wineries for whole-cluster pressing and sparkling wine production but it has not caught on in many wine regions due to concerns about the amount of oxidation it introduces to the wine as well as the large amount of suspended solids that get past the screens.|$|E

25|$|The video {{begins with}} Amy Lee {{dressed in a}} nightgown, barefoot and asleep in a bed within a building, dreaming of <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> air below a skyscraper. As the chorus begins, the band and Paul McCoy are {{performing}} in another room as Lee awakens and makes {{her way to the}} window. Lee climbs out of the window and climbs the building with the wind blowing her hair and dress until she reaches the window of the room where the band is performing. During the bridge, McCoy notices Lee and opens the window, which causes her to lose her balance, and she grabs the ledge. Throughout the bridge and final chorus, McCoy unsuccessfully attempts to pull Lee up, and she falls from his grasp down the building. However, she is then shown asleep in her bed again.|$|E
500|$|Terminal {{velocity}} of hail, or {{the speed at}} which hail is falling when it strikes the ground, varies. It is estimated that a hailstone of [...] in diameter falls at a rate of , while stones the size of [...] in diameter fall at a rate of [...] [...] Hailstone velocity is dependent {{on the size of the}} stone, friction with air it is <b>falling</b> <b>through,</b> <b>the</b> motion of wind it is falling through, collisions with raindrops or other hailstones, and melting as the stones fall through a warmer atmosphere. As hail stones are not perfect spheres it is [...] difficult to calculate their speed accurately.|$|E
500|$|A {{long shot}} of a Zero-X lifting body <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{atmosphere}} and exploding was the only special effects sequence filmed outside the building. Instead, it was mounted on a gantry at a nearby power station against a real sky backdrop and the team used Cordtex explosive strips, gunpowder, naphtha, magnesium and petroleum gel to create a [...] "fireball" [...] effect. Although it took months to construct, the studio's destruction of the Zero-X model was complete in two days. The effects shots for Thunderbirds Are Go later became so {{well known in the}} film industry that the work of Meddings and his team was consulted during pre-production on the 1986 James Cameron film, Aliens.|$|E

50|$|Because {{of the way}} ice dunes form, {{they are}} {{inherently}} weak and filled with cracks and air pockets. People who venture out onto the dunes sometimes will <b>fall</b> <b>through.</b> If <b>the</b> dune extends out over the water, persons who do this can <b>fall</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> dune and into the freezing water underneath; if this happens, hypothermia and death by drowning are urgent, immediate dangers.|$|R
500|$|Eyewitnesses saw Titanics stern rising {{high into}} the air as the ship tilted down in the water. It was said to have reached an angle of 30–45degrees, [...] "revolving {{apparently}} around a centre of gravity just astern of midships," [...] as Lawrence Beesley later put it. Many survivors described a great noise, which some attributed to the boilers exploding. Beesley described it as [...] "partly a groan, partly a rattle, and partly a smash, and it was not a sudden roar as an explosion would be: it went on successively for some seconds, possibly fifteen to twenty". He attributed it to [...] "the engines and machinery coming loose from their bolts and bearings, and <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> compartments, smashing everything in their way".|$|E
500|$|The nest {{is built}} in the {{understorey}} shrubs, relatively close to the ground. Nests have been recorded in prickly coprosma (Coprosma quadrifida), Cassinia, tea-trees (Melaleuca), eucalypts, and acacias, {{as well as in}} garden shrubs. The nest is a fragile, cup-shaped structure, swollen at the sides and narrower at the rim. The female builds the nest, but is often accompanied by the male as she gathers nesting material. Most nests are built of greenish material which varies with the location; in coastal areas grass is the primary material, while in mountain forests the nest is often covered with moss. One bird was recorded repeatedly flying between the nest and a koala [...] away and plucking the long hair near its ears to incorporate in the nest. The nests are very fine, with the eggs visible through the gauze-like walls, and they sometimes fall apart. They have been known to disintegrate with eggs and nestlings <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> bottom.|$|E
500|$|In envisaging how the mind's {{interior}} {{would be}} depicted, the filmmakers {{concentrated on the}} word electrochemical; Ralph Eggleston, the film's production designer, explained, [...] "It meant thinking of things as energy or energy-based, excitable." [...] Each emotion has a glowing, [...] "effervescent quality" [...] to them (particularly Joy), which was difficult to animate {{as it could be}} viewed as distracting. [...] "The characters are created with this energy because we are trying to represent what emotions would look like. They are made up of particles that actually move. Instead of being skin and solid, it is a massive collection of energy," [...] Docter remarked. The team worked for eight months on Joy's [...] "sparkly" [...] aura, but was prepared to delete it, as it would affect the film's budget. However, Lasseter requested that it be applied for each emotion. [...] "You could hear the core technical staff just hitting the ground, the budget <b>falling</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> roof," [...] recalled Eggleston.|$|E
