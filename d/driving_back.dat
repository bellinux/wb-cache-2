When the car loses power, Mulder realizes that nine minutes disappeared after the flash, a phenomenon reported by alien abductees.|$|E
5|$|Morgan placed marksmen at {{strategic}} positions, {{who then}} picked off virtually every {{officer in the}} advance company. Morgan and his men then charged, unaware that they were headed directly for Burgoyne's main army. While they succeeded in <b>driving</b> <b>back</b> the advance company, Fraser's leading edge arrived {{just in time to}} attack Morgan's left, scattering his men back into the woods. James Wilkinson, who had ridden forward to observe the fire, returned to the American camp for reinforcements. As the British company fell back toward the main column, the leading edge of that column opened fire, killing a number of their own men.|$|E

50|$|Martin Lister and {{his father}} Martin Lister were working for the Cold Storage company, driving a waste {{disposal}} lorry. They went to a slaughterhouse on Old Church Road, Romford. When they were entering through the gates to the yard, the father got out ahead and the son, <b>driving,</b> <b>backed</b> over him. McNair J awarded the father {{two thirds of the}} compensation to reflect the father’s contributory negligence. The insurers, who paid £1600 and costs, sued the son {{in the name of the}} company (which was not consulted) by right of subrogation to indemnify them for this sum.|$|R
5|$|Constantine's {{share of}} the Empire {{consisted}} of Britain, Gaul, and Spain. He therefore commanded {{one of the largest}} Roman armies, stationed along the important Rhine frontier. After his promotion to emperor, Constantine remained in Britain, <b>driving</b> <b>back</b> the tribes of the Picts and secured his control in the northwestern dioceses. He completed the reconstruction of military bases begun under his father's rule, and ordered the repair of the region's roadways. He soon left for Augusta Treverorum (Trier) in Gaul, the Tetrarchic capital of the northwestern Roman Empire. The Franks, after learning of Constantine's acclamation, invaded Gaul across the lower Rhine over the winter of 306–307AD. Constantine drove them back beyond the Rhine and captured two of their kings, Ascaric and Merogaisus. The kings and their soldiers were fed to the beasts of Trier's amphitheater in the adventus (arrival) celebrations that followed.|$|E
5|$|In 730, al-Jarrah {{returned}} to the offensive through Tiflis and the Darial Pass. Arab sources report that he reached {{as far as the}} Khazar capital, al-Bayda, on the Volga, but modern historians such as Khalid Yahya Blankinship consider this improbable. Soon after, he was forced back to Bardha'a to defend Arran from invasion by the Khazar general Tharmach. It is unclear whether the Khazars moved through the Darial Pass or the Caspian Gates, but they succeeded in outmanoeuvring al-Jarrah, bypassing the Arab forces and laying siege to Ardabil, the capital of Adharbayjan, where 30,000 Muslim troops and their families were gathered. News of this development forced al-Jarrah to hastily withdraw from Bardha'a and march south in a rapid march to Ardabil's rescue. Outside the city walls, after a three-day battle on 7–9 December 730, al-Jarrah's army of 25,000 was all but annihilated by the Khazars under Barjik, with al-Jarrah himself falling in the field. Command passed to al-Jarrah's brother al-Hajjaj, who was unable to prevent the sacking of Ardabil, or to check Khazar raids that reached as far as south as Mosul. The experienced general Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi was put in command and soon succeeded in <b>driving</b> <b>back</b> the invasion, while under the leadership of Marwan ibn Muhammad (the future Marwan II) the war was concluded in a nominal Arab victory in 737.|$|E
5|$|To gain good terrain for Operation Cobra, Bradley and Collins {{conceived}} {{a plan to}} {{push forward}} to the Saint-Lô–Periers road, along which VII and VIII Corps were securing jumping-off positions. On 18 July, {{at a cost of}} 5,000 casualties, the American 29th and 35th Infantry Divisions managed to gain the vital heights of Saint-Lô, <b>driving</b> <b>back</b> General der Fallschirmtruppen Eugen Meindl's II Parachute Corps. Meindl's paratroopers, together with the 352nd Infantry Division (which had been in action since its D-Day defense of Omaha Beach) were now in ruins, and the stage for the main offensive was set. Due to poor weather conditions that had also been hampering Goodwood and Atlantic, Bradley decided to postpone Cobra for a few days—a decision that worried Montgomery, as the British and Canadian operations had been launched to support a break-out attempt that was failing to materialize. By 24 July the skies had cleared enough for the start order to be given, and 1,600 Allied aircraft took off for Normandy. However, the weather closed in again over the battlefield. Under poor visibility conditions, more than 25 Americans were killed and 130 wounded in the bombing before the air support operation was postponed until the following day. Some enraged soldiers opened fire on their own aircraft, a not uncommon practice in Normandy when suffering from friendly fire.|$|E
