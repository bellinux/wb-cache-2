50|$|William Gadd of Gadd & Mason, from Manchester {{invented the}} spirally-guided gas holder in 1890. Instead {{of the use}} of {{external}} columns or guide frames, his design operated with spiral rails. The first commercial design was built in Northwich, Cheshire in the same year. By the end of the century, most towns in Britain had their own <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> and <b>gas</b> holders.|$|R
40|$|The favored {{method to}} prepare {{diamond-like}} (DLC) coatings is the radio frequency (r. f. / 13. 56 MHz) plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) working with hydrocarbon <b>gases.</b> <b>Working</b> <b>gas</b> pressures typically range from 0. 5 to 2 Pa. However, {{it is difficult}} to scale up r. F. deposition arrangements. Furthermore the costs for the necessary r. f. generators are rather high. To overcome these problems we used so called mediumfrequency (m. f.) discharges (some 10 to 300 kHz) for plasma generation. Both, harmonic a. c. and pulsed d. c. voltages were used to excite the plasma. DLC deposition could be carried out in the above mentioned pressure range as well as at higher pressures up to some 100 Pa. The quality of the films, especially with respect to wear and friction was {{the same as that of}} r. f. plasma prepared DLC films. Some examples and coating applications will be reported...|$|R

5000|$|Although the {{confrontation}} {{has come to}} be known as the [...] "Battle of Saltley Gate", the picketed depot was located in the adjacent ward of Nechells. Robert Kellaway said: [...] "Many commentators have discussed the mythology surrounding the [...] "The Battle of Saltley Gate" [...] yet its most obvious myth - its name - has often been overlooked. The confrontation actually took place at the gate for Nechells <b>gas</b> <b>works.</b> The Saltley <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> and its [...] "gates" [...] were on the other side of the Saltley Viaduct adjacent to the Nechells works. As local trade unionist Bill Shreeve declared, [...] "The press and the media kept insisting on calling it Saltley Gate and that's gone down in the history books."" [...] Don Perrygrove, a local union official, said: [...] "Next to Saltley <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> there's also a locality where there used to be a tollgate, and that is called [...] "Saltley Gate" [...] and when people were trying to close the <b>gas</b> <b>works...</b> they assumed that it was one and the same." ...|$|R
50|$|The 11th {{district}} {{has always been}} known for its industries. In the 19th century, Simmering generated and supplied the electricity for the Straßenbahnen (trams) of Vienna and also had a <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> to supply the city with town gas for its lights. The <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> produced natural <b>gas</b> from 1899 to 1978, but today serves as a distribution post for natural gas brought in. There were huge 70-meter tall gas tanks on the premises, called the Gasometer (featured in the James Bond film The Living Daylights). Reconstruction in 2001 converted the structures from containers to buildings that today house apartments, offices, a shopping centre, and a cinema. The towers of the Gasometer have ranked next to the Zentralfriedhof as a landmark of the 11th district.|$|R
50|$|By {{around the}} start of the 20th century, Wetherby had a mixed economy. The town had a large mill which {{employed}} many in the town. The trades which had kept Wetherby going in earlier decades still thrived, such as the cattle market and the towns many inns, which served travellers on the A1. The growth of the railways in the 19th century had lessened Wetherby's strategic position on the Great North Road. Wetherby by this time had rail links to Leeds, Harrogate and York and had its own <b>gas</b> <b>works,</b> producing town <b>gas.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1818 <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> {{were built}} on the north bank of the River Thames in St Ebbes, to supply the city with gas. St Ebbes {{expanded}} significantly in the 19th century, and by 1882 {{there was no room}} to expand the <b>gas</b> <b>works,</b> and new gasholders had to be {{built on the}} south bank of the river. A railway bridge (the Gasworks Bridge) was built across the river to connect the <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> to the Great Western Railway line. The <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> were closed in 1960.|$|R
5000|$|Tear [...] "gas" [...] {{consists}} of aerosolized solid compounds, not <b>gas.</b> Tear <b>gas</b> <b>works</b> by irritating mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, mouth and lungs, and causes crying, sneezing, coughing, difficulty breathing, {{pain in the}} eyes, and temporary blindness. With CS gas, symptoms of irritation typically appear after 20-60 seconds of exposure and commonly resolve within 30 minutes of leaving (or being removed from) the area. With pepper spray (also called [...] "oleoresin capsicum", capsaicinoid or OC gas), the onset of symptoms, including loss of motor control, is almost immediate. There can be considerable variation in tolerance and response, according to the National Research Council (US) Committee on Toxicology.|$|R

40|$|International audienceGas {{hydrates}} or {{clathrate hydrates}} are crystalline compounds formed {{by a combination}} of guest molecules and a network of water molecules. They are formed at under suitable condition of high pressure and low temperature. On the other hand, using some promoters it is possible to form the called semiclathrates at significantly lower pressure and higher temperature. Some small cages dodecahedral cavities are available in the structure of these solids and can encaged small gas molecules, such as CH 4, CO 2 and H 2 S. In recent years, research involving gas separation and gas storage process using semiclathrate formation have increased substantially. These processes require knowledge about phase diagram of the system containing the gas and the additive in aqueous solution. Several kinds of promoters have already been studied, but mostly for pure <b>gases.</b> <b>Works</b> involving the <b>gas</b> mixture are still rare. In this work we studied the equilibrium conditions for semiclathrate formation for two promoters: Tetrabutylphosphonium bromide (TBPB) and tributylphospine oxide (TBPO) are promising promoter...|$|R
