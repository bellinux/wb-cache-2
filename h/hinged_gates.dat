25|$|Sandstone slip gate piers {{are found}} at the bottom entry point to the Buchans field beside the {{pedestrian}} footpath. Such slip gates were built {{with a series of}} downward facing 'L'-shaped grooves {{on one side and a}} matching concavity on the other gatepost. Wood bars could then be inserted across and parallel, giving a gate without a hinge. These are sometimes still found in the countryside at large, but they are almost always adapted to carry metal <b>hinged</b> <b>gates.</b> In some areas wood rather than stone was used to construct this type of hinge-less gatepost.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hinged</b> <b>gates</b> are {{relatively}} complicated, and so expensive, to construct. Large gates require powered machinery to operate them, machinery {{that must be}} provided for each set of gates.|$|E

50|$|The {{revolver}} was a six-shot open-framed design, {{which was}} loaded via a <b>hinged</b> <b>gate</b> {{on the right}} side of the frame, through which empty cartridges were also ejected via an ejector rod running along the barrel.|$|R
50|$|A further {{advantage}} of the floating caisson is that, unlike the <b>hinged</b> <b>gate,</b> it does not need space within the dock {{to allow it to}} swing. This increases the useful length within the dock, or may permit a smaller and cheaper dock to be constructed.|$|R
50|$|A maillon, maillon rapide or {{quick link}} is a metal link, {{similar to a}} carabiner. Maillons have a {{threaded}} sleeve which tightens over a thread, {{as opposed to a}} hinged gate like a carabiner, making them stronger, but more difficult to use. Like carabiners, maillons are available in a range of shapes and thicknesses (i.e., strengths), and often offer greater versatility over carabiners as their different shapes and lack of <b>hinged</b> <b>gates</b> allow them to be used in multi-directional load situations.|$|E

50|$|These {{were the}} forerunner of both <b>hinged</b> <b>gates</b> and 'Slip Gates' and were merely wood spars or {{branches}} placed across a gap in a hedge or dyke with the spars {{held in place by}} the hedge or by the stones. Great care was required when replacing the spars to ensure that they were stock proof. especially as in times past footfall in the countryside was much greater with many more farm workers and also locals foraging for foods such as mushrooms, watercress, brambles, etc. 'Slaps' were still in use up until the mid 20th century.|$|E
40|$|The {{sport of}} equestrian cross country {{eventing}} has seen many serious and even fatal injuries due to rotational horse falls in recent years. The sport originally consisted of horse and rider teams jumping stationary, wood fences. However, {{in a move}} towards increasing safety for horses and riders, frangible and deformable safety devices have been emerging in the field. This thesis {{provides an overview of}} safety designs that are currently available and those that are on the horizon. Also, a path-finder method of evaluating and developing safety fence designs was outlined and applied to two distinct designs, a <b>hinged</b> <b>gate</b> and a collapsible table fence. A full size prototype of the <b>hinged</b> <b>gate</b> was constructed and tested in the field in two different locations. The collapsible table fence design was developed and then a geometric scale prototype was constructe...|$|R
50|$|The dam {{has five}} bay {{spillway}} controlled by 30.5 m wide, hydraulically operated fish-belly flap <b>gates.</b> <b>Hinge</b> anchors support the flap gates; with six <b>hinges</b> per <b>gate,</b> and four anchors per <b>hinge.</b> The fish-belly <b>gates</b> {{allow for a}} precise control of water level, reducing the dead area on the banks {{between high and low}} water levels. As at November 2010, the five gates have only been opened simultaneously once in the dam's history, during heavy flooding in 1976.|$|R
50|$|Distinctive {{interior}} {{features include}} the vestibule, lobby and information desk, center stairway, cashier’s office, and {{public and private}} collectors offices. From the main entry on the front facade, a small vestibule opens into the lobby. In the lobby are bulletin cases of glass and wood marked “Immigration” and “Customs,” and a wood building directory. A recessed area contains a wood-panel information desk with a <b>hinged</b> <b>gate.</b> In {{the wall behind the}} desk, a shallow, elaborately detailed closet was built into one of the original arches in the masonry bearing wall.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, bamboo poles {{were used}} for gates, the {{rigidity}} of which forced skiers to maneuver their entire body around each gate. The early 1980s, rigid poles were replaced by hard plastic poles, hinged at the base with a universal joint designed and patented by Peter Laehy and Stefan Dag in Aspen, CO. USA. Patent # 4,270,873. The <b>hinged</b> <b>gates</b> require, according to FIS rules, only that the skis and boots of the skier go around each gate. By 1989 most of the top technical skiers in the world had adopted the cross-block technique.|$|E
5000|$|Most locks {{are closed}} by chevron or mitre gates {{rather than by}} caissons. These are pairs of <b>hinged</b> <b>gates</b> that form a [...] "V" [...] shape, with the deeper water outside the V. Water {{pressure}} thus holds them closed. These gates can be opened and closed quickly, so they are used for canal locks, to change levels, and also for most freight docks. As the function of a freight dock is to enclose deep water, such gates point inwards. A graving or dry dock, in contrast, excludes water, and so their gates point outwards.|$|E
50|$|Slip gates are {{a form of}} gate which permits {{people and}} {{vehicles}} through an entrance but which blocks the passage of animals. Branches or worked wood crossbars or stangs were used, one field slip gate pier with 'L' shaped grooves and the opposing stile gatepost with square or circular concavities to receive {{the three or four}} horizontal crossbars. Most of these have long been converted to carry <b>hinged</b> <b>gates,</b> though one survives unaltered at the Museum of Scottish Rural Life, Kittochside on Wester Kittochside farm, East Kilbride, Scotland. They were sometimes made entirely of wood, such as oak, which is relatively long lasting.|$|E
50|$|Jalashwa {{features}} a well deck, which can house {{up to four}} LCM-8 mechanised landing craft that can be launched by flooding the well deck and lowering the <b>hinged</b> <b>gate</b> aft of the ship. She also has a flight deck for helicopter operations from which up to six medium helicopters can operate simultaneously. The deck {{can also be used}} to operate vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft like the Sea Harrier, in special circumstances. She is also capable of embarking over 1,000 troops, and is fully equipped with extensive medical facilities including four operation theatres, a 12-bed ward, a laboratory and a dental centre.|$|R
50|$|The normal {{construction}} is a half-round, rectangular, trapezoidal or V-shaped enclosure with a <b>hinged</b> <b>gate</b> trapped between its arms. When the gate is parked at {{either side of}} the enclosure, there is no gap to pass through. However, the gate can be pushed to give access to the small enclosure, then moved in the opposite direction to close the first opening and allow exit from the enclosure to the other side. The gate is usually self-closing, to the side away from the land where animals are kept. The self-closing may be by hinge geometry, or by a spring or weight.|$|R
50|$|The Model 25 {{logic is}} built on IBM SLT modules mounted on {{pluggable}} cards, which are plugged into printed circuit boards. The boards are mounted on <b>hinged</b> metal <b>gates,</b> and are interconnected by flat cables.|$|R
50|$|At {{the heart}} of his new dockyard, Dummer placed a stone-lined basin, giving access to what proved to be the first {{successful}} stepped stone dry dock in Europe. Previously the Navy Board had relied upon timber as the major building material for dry docks, which resulted in high maintenance costs and was also a fire risk. The docks Dummer designed were stronger with more secure foundations and stepped sides that made it easier for men to work beneath the hull of a docked vessel. These innovations also allowed rapid erection of staging and greater workforce mobility. He discarded the earlier three-sectioned <b>hinged</b> <b>gate,</b> which was labour-intensive in operation, and replaced it with the simpler and more mobile two-sectioned gate.|$|R

50|$|Most harness races {{start from}} behind a {{motorized}} starting gate. The horses line up behind a slow-moving, <b>hinged</b> <b>gate</b> mounted on a motor vehicle, which then leads them to the starting line. At the line, {{the wings of the}} gate are folded up and the vehicle accelerates away from the horses. Another kind of start is a standing start, where there are tapes or imaginary lines across the track behind which the horses either stand stationary or trot in circles in pairs in a specific pattern to hit the starting line as a group. This enables handicaps to be placed on horses (according to class) with several tapes, usually with 10 or 20 meters between tapes. Many European - and some Australian and New Zealand - races use a standing start.|$|R
50|$|A {{single track}} enters the shed {{at the western}} and eastern ends through new <b>hinged</b> double <b>gates</b> clad with colorbond. A new {{concrete}} floor has replaced the original timber floor. Original offices at each end have also been removed. Two new roller shutter doors {{are located in the}} southern and western sides.|$|R
50|$|At first shippers used {{lighters}} {{to ferry}} cargo out to anchored ships, {{but this was}} a slow process. By 1860 a gravity chute called an apron or slide chute was developed. It consisted of an A-frame on the bluff and an apron that could be adjusted to the height of the ships’ decks. Lumbermen sent down cargo from the bluff, which was as high as 150 feet, by the chute powered by gravity. A <b>hinged</b> <b>gate</b> covered with iron rode in the chute governed the speed of the wood. A primitive brake called a clapper provided additional control over the speed. It was a moveable plank tongue positioned on the outer end of the apron. It was the responsibility of the clapperman to regulate the speed by a lever. It was dangerous work; if the seaman slipped or the brakeman was slow, the lumber could kill or injure the crew member.|$|R
50|$|Gates {{were used}} to {{separate}} one space from another in traditional Korean architecture. This function made them symbols {{of the process of}} opening and closing spaces. As an object attached to a gate, the latch became imbued with this symbolism while also serving a practical function as a lock. The latch is a wooden bar that functions as a locking device on the inside of a <b>hinged</b> <b>gate</b> of a traditional-style building. It was often decorated with auspicious animals. A turtle-shaped hinge panel was traditional and very common, as the turtle is a symbol of long life and security. The basis for this association with security is the hard shell of a turtle, which it was believed would become a strong guard shielding a family from harm. Additionally, as turtles do not lose their grip on prey they have caught, a turtle-shaped latch implies that the door has been firmly shut.|$|R
50|$|The {{drawback}} with 'Slip Gates' was {{the wear}} and tare {{at the ends}} of the wood spars leading to failure of one or more when placed under stress, a problem not encountered with <b>hinged</b> frame-style <b>gates.</b> Some slip gate piers were adapted for use as standard field gates with holes cut through for a pair of hinges and a latch.|$|R
50|$|Previously the Navy Board had {{relied upon}} timber {{as the major}} {{building}} material, which resulted in high maintenance costs and was also a fire risk. The docks Dummer designed were stronger with more secure foundations and stepped sides that allowed shorter timbers {{to be used for}} shoring and made it much easier for shipwrights to reach the underside of the vessel. These innovations also allowed rapid erection of staging and greater workforce mobility. He discarded the earlier three-sectioned <b>hinged</b> <b>gate,</b> which was labour-intensive in operation, and replaced it with the simpler and more mobile two-sectioned gate. He wished to ensure that naval dockyards were efficient working units that maximised available space, as evidenced by the simplicity of his design layout for Plymouth. He introduced a centralised storage area and a logical positioning of buildings, and his double rope-house combined the previously separate tasks of spinning and laying while allowing the upper floor to be used for the repair of sails.|$|R
5000|$|Most harness races now {{start from}} behind a {{motorized}} starting gate, called a [...] "car start" [...] or [...] "auto start". This device consists of a car or pickup truck equipped with a <b>hinged</b> <b>gate</b> that resembles metal [...] "wings" [...] {{on each side of}} the vehicle. As the vehicle is driven down the center of the track, the wings are extended and the horses line up in order behind it. When the gate reaches the starting line, the starter retracts the wings, which fold inward toward the vehicle body. The vehicle then accelerates away from the horses and pulls off to the outside to let the racers proceed; it many cases, it then follows close behind the racers for officials to view the race and any potential infractions of rules. The modern starting gate uses a driver for steering the vehicle while the starter sits in the rear to concentrate on the actual horses positioning during the [...] "score up". The starter will also observe the race and call a false start if required.|$|R
50|$|Due to the secretive {{nature of}} the ninja, {{there is no way}} of knowing exactly when and where the shobo was invented (meaning no more precise than feudal Japan) and exactly how popular it was among the ninja. It is {{believed}} this was an improvised weapon, with common origins cited as bridle bits for horses and livestock, harness rings for reins, and metal <b>hinges</b> for <b>gates</b> and doors. How the weapon was formalized is still up for debate.|$|R
40|$|AbstractVoltage-gated sodium {{channels}} {{are members of}} a large family with similar pore structures. The mechanism of opening and closing is unknown, but structural studies suggest gating via bending of the inner pore helix at a glycine hinge. Here we provide functional evidence for this gating model for the bacterial sodium channel NaChBac. Mutation of glycine 219 to proline, which would strongly favor bending of the α helix, greatly enhances activation by shifting its voltage dependence − 51 mV and slowing deactivation by 2000 -fold. The mutation also slows voltage-dependent inactivation by 1200 -fold. The effects are specific because substitutions of proline at neighboring positions and substitutions of other amino acids at position 219 have much smaller functional effects. Our results fit a model in which concerted bending at glycine 219 in the S 6 segments of NaChBac serves as a <b>gating</b> <b>hinge.</b> This <b>gating</b> motion may be conserved in most members of this large ion channel protein family...|$|R
50|$|A pair {{of steel}} <b>gates</b> <b>hinged</b> from brick posts {{are located on}} the south eastern {{boundary}} of the school; these gates mark an entry {{that is no longer}} in use. A porphyry square-necked rubble wall runs along part of the southern boundary.|$|R
50|$|A {{swing check}} valve or tilting disc check valve is a check valve in which the disc, the movable part to block the flow, swings on a hinge or trunnion, either onto the seat to block reverse flow or off the seat to allow forward flow. The seat opening {{cross-section}} may be perpendicular to the centerline between the two ports or at an angle. Although {{swing check valve}}s can come in various sizes, large check valves are often swing check valves. The flapper valve in a flush-toilet mechanism {{is an example of}} this type of valve. Tank pressure holding it closed is overcome by manual lift of the flapper. It then remains open until the tank drains and the flapper falls due to gravity. Another variation of this mechanism is the clapper valve, used in applications such firefighting and fire life safety systems. A <b>hinged</b> <b>gate</b> only remains open in the inflowing direction. The clapper valve often also has a spring that keeps the gate shut when there is no forward pressure. Another example is the backwater valve (for sanitary drainage system) that protects against flooding caused by return flow of sewage waters. Such risk occurs most often in sanitary drainage systems connected to combined sewerage systems and in rainwater drainage systems. It may be caused by intense rainfall, thaw or flood.|$|R
5|$|Between the Octagon and {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} in the north wall was a barbican, of which little survives– {{just a piece of}} the west wall– although the structure was originally two storeys high. The surviving fabric includes a slot for a portcullis for the barbican's north gate, although there are no <b>hinges</b> for <b>gates.</b> The base of a garderobe demonstrates that second storey would have provided space for habitation, probably a guard room. Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican still standing and includes detail such as vaulting inside the passageway.|$|R
5000|$|Flap sluice gate: A fully {{automatic}} type, {{controlled by the}} pressure head across it; operation {{is similar to that}} of a check valve. It is a <b>gate</b> <b>hinged</b> at the top. When pressure is from one side, the gate is kept closed; a pressure from the other side opens the sluice when a threshold pressure is surpassed.|$|R

After a flood in 1961 and several {{near-miss}} floods, flood protection has been installed. The protection consists of 2, 916 feet of concrete flood walls, 8, 769 feet of levee, five rolling gates, four stoplog gaps, one <b>hinged</b> pedestrian <b>gate,</b> and one sandbag gap. The flood walls are over 14 feet tall. Construction was started on August 3, 1992 and was completed in early 1995.
