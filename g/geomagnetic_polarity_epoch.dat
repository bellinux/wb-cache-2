40|$|Bathymetry, seismic {{reflection}} profiles, magnetic data, and dredged basalt {{indicate that}} two centres of spreading have existed near {{the northern end}} of Juan de Fuca Ridge in the last 0. 7 m. y. (Brunhes <b>Geomagnetic</b> <b>Polarity</b> <b>Epoch).</b> A short-lived eastern branch functioned only {{in the early part of}} the Brunhes Epoch. More prolonged and recent activity has occurred on the western branch, and has involved extrusion of basalt, rifting, and uplift. The anomalous relief of {{the northern end of}} Juan de Fuca Ridge compared to the ridge further south is the result of a tectonic event which occurred 100, 000 - 350, 000 years ago. Prior to this, turbidites were deposited over most of the northern part of the ridge, which consisted of a series of basement ridges and valleys of subdued relief trending NNE parallel to the magnetic anomalies. During the event, the igneous basement together with the overlying turbidites was faulted, tilted, and uplifted along the primary structural trends. The basement relief was increased in places to more than 2 km. Subsequent turbidite deposition has been confined to valleys. The Sovanco Fracture Zone between Juan de Fuca and Explorer Ridges also suffered uplift. The tectonic disturbance may have resulted from an increase in spreading rate or the change in location of the axis of spreading on Juan de Fuca Ridge, or compressional interaction between Explorer sub-plate to the north and Sovanco Fracture Zone and the northern end of Juan de Fuca Ridge. Sovanco Fracture Zone, consisting of a WNW-trending basement ridge (Sovanco Ridge) with complex associated magnetic anomalies, may have originated as a strike-slip fault or fault-zone trending east-west about 5 m. y. ago. Location of present transform movement within the fracture zone is equivocal, but apparently trends NW. A specimen of basalt from the eastern end of Sovanco Ridge yielded a fission track age of < 309, 000 years. Basalts dredged from 13 locations on Juan de Fuca Ridge, Sovanco Ridge, and Heck and Heckle Seamount Chains on the western flank of Juan de Fuca Ridge are low-potassium tholeiites of the ocean ridge type. Twenty-seven representative specimens of fresh basalt, as well as 15 samples of glass selvages and altered basalt, were analyzed for 9 major elements by an atomic absorption technique set up by the author. The analyses are closely similar, showing no well-developed differentiation trend. They straddle the boundary between the olivine-normative and quartz-normative fields, and the basalts may have been derived by segregation from the mantle at a depth of about 15 km. A specimen from NE of the eastern spreading centre yielded a fission track age of 0. 95 ± 0. 53 m. y. which is in reasonable agreement with the age of 0. 7 - 0. 9 m. y. predicted by the magnetic anomaly time scale. Increasing thicknesses of Fe-Mn coatings on dredged basalts indicate that the two NW-trending seamount chains increase in age away from the crest of Juan de Fuca Ridge. The seamounts originated and grew to virtually their present sizes while still at or near the ridge crest. Reflection profiles across the continental slope indicate that it has formed by folding, reverse faulting, and uplift of strata of Cascadia Basin. Internal deformation has caused these sediments to behave as acoustical basement in the structures beneath the slope but their sedimentary nature has been confirmed by dredging. The presence of magnetic anomalies 5 - 8 m. y. old beneath the lower and middle continental slope indicates subduction. The magnetic basement dips below the slope at an angle of more than 10 °...|$|E

40|$|Since the 1960 's, the <b>geo{{magnetic}}</b> <b>polarity</b> time scale, {{which is}} based on marine magnetic anomalies, has become fundamentally important in geochronology. Despite the importance of marine magnetic anomaly records, there has been longstanding uncertainty about the meaning of the smallest anomalies observed in these records. Small amplitude, short wavelength anomalies are frequently observed in marine magnetic anomaly records across fast-spreading oceanic crust (> 50 mm/yr). The origin of these small-scale anomalies (referred to as `tiny wiggles') has remained controversial over the last 30 years. `Tiny wiggles' have been interpreted to represent either short-period polarity intervals or large-scale fluctuations in the ancient field intensity. We present palaeomagnetic evidence from a sedimentary record from the North Pacific Ocean, which demonstrates that two short, but clearly resolvable, polarity zones, in addition to a probable geomagnetic excursion, occur within Chron C 5 n. 2 n (9. 92 – 10. 95 Ma) where three `tiny wiggles' have been reported on marine magnetic anomaly profiles. Relative palaeointensity data indicate that the field collapsed prior to and during the reversals (and during the excursion) but that it recovered to higher field intensities within the polarity intervals before collapsing to low values at the succeeding polarity transition. This indicates that some `tiny wiggles' represent real short-period <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>polarity</b> intervals, while others may represent geomagnetic excursions. The existence of such short polarity intervals confirms the predictions of statistical analyses of geomagnetic reversal frequency and indicates that `tiny wiggles' represent the maximum resolution of <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>polarity</b> intervals in marine magnetic anomaly records...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} are twofold. First, the study tries to provide the most {{reliable}} chronology possible for two critical sections by correlating the magnetic polarity stratigraphy measured in these sediments with a newly revised <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>polarity</b> time scale. Second, this study attempts to examine in detail the nature of seven short events not included in the shipboard standard time scale, but for which abundant magnetostratigraphic evidence was obtained during the Leg. Data presented here force some modifications of the shipboard interpretations of the magnetostratigraphy of Sites 845 and 844 on the basis of new data generated using discrete samples and from a greater appreciation of the magnetostratigraphic signature of Miocene-age short events. Those short events can be classified into two groups: those that probably reflect short, full-polarity intervals and those that more likely represent an interval of diminished geomagnetic intensity. Three of the seven events documented here correspond well with three subtle features, as seen in marine magnetic profiles, that have been newly included in the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>polarity</b> time scale as short, full-polarity chrons. One of the seven events corresponds to a poorly defined feature of the marine magnetic record that has also been newly included in the <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>polarity</b> time scale, but which was considered of enigmatic origin. The three remaining events investigated here, although they have not been identified with features in the seafloor magnetic record, are suggested to be events of a similar nature, most likely times of anomalously low geomagnetic intensity. In addition to the Miocene magnetostratigraphic results given, several sets of averaged paleomagnetic inclinations are presented. Although these results clearly show the effects of a residual coring overprint, they demonstrate that paleomagnetic estimates of paleolatitudes can be made which are in good general agreement with ancient site positions calculated using hot spot-based plate reconstructions...|$|R
