5|$|Home Made Mince Pie is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a comedy of circumstances, in which the Gale family is going to host a dinner. The focus of the humor is in a mince pie that brandy is added to {{in an attempt to}} make it more appreciable, but three people each add brandy to the pie. Everyone becomes tipsy upon eating the pie, including the family cat, and the film concludes. No cast or staff credits for this film are known. The film was released on September 27, 1910, to mixed reviews in trade publications. Reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unbelievable</b> that one pie split eight ways would be able to impact everyone. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{a common}} {{criticism}} that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unbelievable</b> in story plots to have villains {{try to kill}} the heroes in such elaborate ways when they could use simple methods like shooting them.

500|$|After Shankly {{left school}} in 1928, {{he worked at}} a local mine {{alongside}} his brother Bob. He did this for two years until the pit closed and he faced unemployment. In his autobiography, he described {{the life of a}} miner at some length and mentioned many of the problems such as the sheer hard work, rats, the difficulties of eating and drinking at the coal face, but above all the filth: [...] "We were never really clean. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>unbelievable</b> how we survived. Going home to wash in a tub was the biggest thing. The first time I was in a bath was when I was 15".|$|E
500|$|For {{several years}} after he had turned 40, Miller {{concentrated}} on composing and playing his own music. He therefore reduced his recording and club appearances, as well as one-day associations. The stimulus for this change had built gradually from Miller's first studio recording in 1981: [...] "my recording activity increased {{and by the time}} that it got into 1986–87 I was on so many records <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unbelievable</b> until eventually it became rather overwhelming and stressful, so I had to cut back." [...] He did continue to record, often with musicians he had established relationships with: in 1996 he reunited with Williams to appear on what became the drummer's final recording, Young at Heart; further albums led by Kenny Garrett, Nelson, Reeves, and others were made in the period 1997–99.|$|E
500|$|Of Easy Jet's stamina {{and busy}} {{training}} regimen, Merrick said, [...] "I guess he ate at night; I don't know when else. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>unbelievable</b> {{the amount of}} energy he had". Training for the race track generally begins when a horse is a long yearling—between one and a half and two years of age. [...] Easy Jet was so easy to train that Merrick decided to oversee the training himself rather than send the horse away to a professional trainer. In a practice race at the ranch, Merrick matched the yearling against Jet Smooth. Although his elder brother had the advantage of previous race experience, Easy Jet won the 350-yard (320m) race. Easy Jet's performance prompted Merrick to enter him in a yearling race at Blue Ribbon Downs, which the colt won by more than a length.|$|E

500|$|Several {{employees}} of The Simpsons {{were impressed with}} Gaga's performance, who cited that her vocal range and ad-libbing skills were exceptional. Series creator Matt Groening stated: [...] "Since the very beginning, I’ve always wanted {{to have on the}} most iconic personalities of our time, and she's it." [...] In an interview with E! Online, Groening further commented on Gaga's appearance; [...] "The great thing about having Lady Gaga is that she came in a number of times and always with a different getup. Like she'd leave the room and come back in after a break in a completely new getup. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>unbelievable.</b> The only time that she ever took off her hat was when it was banging into the microphone." [...] Cast member Yeardley Smith said that she was shocked that Gaga had the time to make an appearance on the series.|$|E
500|$|Ruth {{made one}} final trip {{on behalf of}} American Legion Baseball, then entered Memorial Hospital, where he would die. He was never told he had cancer, but before his death, had surmised it. He was able to leave the {{hospital}} for a few short trips, including a final visit to Baltimore. On July 26, 1948, Ruth left the hospital to attend the premiere of the film The Babe Ruth Story. Shortly thereafter, Ruth returned to the hospital for the final time. He was barely able to speak. Ruth's condition gradually grew worse; only a few visitors were allowed to see him, one of whom was National League president and future Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick. [...] "Ruth was so thin <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unbelievable.</b> He had been such a big man and his arms were just skinny little bones, and his face was so haggard", Frick said years later.|$|E

I learned lots of things about the process, like rippling. One scene, some figures were standing on a hill and a big gust of wind came up and the shadows moved {{back and forth on}} the clothes and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unbelievable</b> in animation. I don't think I could get the feeling of cold on the screen without showing snow or an icicle on some guy's nose. The characters have weight and they move correctly." [...] After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters, and cars could be seen in the footage Bakshi had shot, they tried to incinerate the footage, telling Bakshi's first assistant director that [...] "if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again." ...|$|E

We're going to make a homespun version of it instead. We're just going to take it easy. I'll get in the pool and sing. Or let's go in the gym and do our parts.' That was Smiley Smile." [...] In interviews conducted over the next year, Brian intimated that he had run out of ideas [...] "in a conventional sense", and that he was [...] "about ready to die". He says: [...] "I decided not to try any more, and not try and do such great things ... And we had so much fun. The Smiley Smile era was so great, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unbelievable.</b> Personally, spiritually, everything, it was great. I didn't have any paranoia feelings." [...] Carl described the end product as [...] "a bunt instead of a grand slam".|$|E
500|$|Kahne {{appeared}} in victory lane {{in front of}} the crowd of 170,000 to celebrate his sixth win of the season earning him $305,889. Kahne was delighted with his victory and thanked the people who worked on his car's transmission and rear-end: [...] "We had a great car. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>unbelievable</b> all night. I slammed it into second gear at the end of pit road one time and I thought I had to break something. This isn't the special car. This car's been good two other times this year, but it went to waste. It's just an awesome team." [...] Second-place finisher Johnson said he finished the event where he ran in its duration: “I only made up ten points. But ten points is ten points.” Third-place finisher Burton was happy to recover from a tire issue from the previous race at Talladega Superspeedway. However, he was upset that he stalled his engine as he felt it cost him the chance of victory. Burton also said his late-race vibration was enough to scare him and was glad the race ended because of the amount of shudder coming from his car: [...] "I screamed, ‘We’ve got a wheel loose, we got a wheel loose’ and they said, {{we do not have a}} wheel loose, we know we got them tight." ...|$|E
500|$|In another {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, the actor spoke thoroughly of his departure, saying: [...] "It's {{not that one}} hadn't agreed to a reduction, but they hit you with a sledgehammer. It's done in such an insulting fashion. It could have been dealt with in a far more gracious way. It is cold and hard-nosed... The whole thing was so calculated <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unbelievable...</b> It's not even about the money." [...] Despite this, during contract negotiations, Braeden refused {{to say that he}} had departed fully, but did not know when a return would occur. However, within weeks, news broke that the actor and the series had managed a new contract. In a statement issued by CBS Daytime, they said: [...] "We're very happy that Eric will be remaining with The Young and the Restless. Victor Newman has been {{an important part of the}} Genoa City canvas for nearly 30 years, and we know our audience will be tuning in to see what his plans are next." [...] Onscreen, Braeden exited November 2, 2009, and made his return on January 15, 2010. That same year, the actor celebrated thirty years on the soap opera. In 2012, Braeden experienced further contract negotiations and speculation arose again that he would be leaving. Published reports said that Victor would be absent from the canvas for two weeks and that his contract expired that November. Two months later, it was announced that the actor had signed a new contract with The Young and the Restless, furthering his portrayal of Victor for an unspecified period of time. Braeden stated that he was [...] "very glad we got the negotiations successfully behind us".|$|E

UFC bantamweight champion TJ Dillashaw stated that he used Slack's article Killing the King: Renan Barao in preparation for his fight against then title holder Barao.

2500|$|On {{their opening}} drive, the Cowboys {{advanced}} to the Pittsburgh 38-yard line, with running back Tony Dorsett gaining 38 yards off 3 running plays.

Receiver Drew Pearson later explained [...] "We practiced that play for three weeks. It is designed for me to hit Billy Joe 15 to 17 yards downfield. We practiced the play so much <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unbelievable</b> we could fumble it. I expected the handoff a bit lower, but I should have had it.

2500|$|Allmendinger, leading with 70 laps to go, had a clasp {{from his}} {{seatbelt}} come loose {{and was forced}} to make a pitstop so his pit crew could refasten it, losing the lead.

Ryan Hunter-Reay had been in the lead during this caution flag, but when the caution ended, Kanaan, who ran in the top ten most of the race, slipped by Hunter-Reay to take the lead. Just when Kanaan led in the first turn, Dario Franchitti crashed with three laps left, causing another yellow caution flag that would last {{for the remainder of the}} race. Under the yellow flag, Kanaan finished the final 3 1/2 laps to win his first Indy 500, with Carlos Muñoz in second place and Hunter-Reay in third. The race featured more lead changes than any previous Indianapolis 500 with 68, twice the number of the previous record (34), set in 2012.
