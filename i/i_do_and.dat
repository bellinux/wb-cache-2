5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

Some routine examples: <b>I</b> <b>do</b> wrong, <b>and</b> wrong you, by doing something bad for you, by feeding you contaminated meat. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> wrong, <b>and</b> wrong you, by failing to do something good for you, by ignoring your S.

500|$|Nothing {{would have}} {{happened}} without the Pistols. It was like, [...] "Wow, I believe in this." [...] What they were saying was: [...] "It's a load of shite. I'm {{going to do what}} <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> I don't care what people think." [...] That was the key to it. People forget that, but it was the main ideology for me: we don't care what you think—you're shit anyway. It was the attitude that got people moving, as well as the music.|$|E
500|$|In {{more recent}} years, frontwoman Love {{stated that the}} album {{contains}} [...] "nothing melodic". In a 2011 interview for Hit So Hard (2011), a documentary on later Hole drummer Patty Schemel, Love referred to Pretty on the Inside as [...] "unlistenable", going on to say: [...] "That record was a calling card for rock critics and hardcorers, [...] 'This is what <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> I {{am not going to}} back down from it.

500|$|Adam's {{off-screen}} {{background was}} established to reflect that of his father; the character was highly self-motivated, studying at college and beginning a career in finance. In an interview with Soaps In Depth, Engen said, [...] "Luckily, I'm {{not going to be}} compared to anyone else...anything <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> anything I try to project, and [...] kind of ideas that I have to influence the character are okay". The actor stated his intent to portray Adam as a [...] "rich, three-dimensional character with ambitions, flaws, and the positive qualities of his mother Hope".|$|E

500|$|I {{needed to}} {{maintain}} a very strong relationship with Tommy [...] During that period, {{the beginning of their}} end, I had to stay away more than normal from her because she was going through a rough time. She felt that shutting her relationship with Tommy was also a cleansing of who she was. She felt that part of what she was dropping was the shmaltzy pop singer ballad kind of stuff he was adamant about. I had to make my exit and say 'Mariah, you need to redefine yourself, that's fine. I'm here doing what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> if and when you want to come back and do it again, I'm here.|$|E
500|$|Afterward, Johnson began celebrating {{his fourth}} {{consecutive}} Sprint Cup Series championship. During the celebration, Johnson was delighted with his performance, saying, [...] "The {{truth of it}} is, to do something that's never been done in this sport -- to love the sport like <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> respect it like I do -- and the greats: Petty, Earnhardt, Gordon ... to do something they've never done is so awesome. To win four championships in eight years, what this team has done ... I don't know where to start. It's unbelievable." [...] Burton, who finished second, commended Johnson's achievements saying, [...] "It’s hard to say he’s the best when you’re out there racing against him, {{but you have to}} put him on the list.” Martin, who finished second in points, said, ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Levine had {{stated that}} he {{believed}} Maroon 5 was reaching its peak and might make one more album before disbanding. He was quoted explaining: [...] "Eventually I {{want to focus on}} being a completely different person because I don't know if I want to do this into my 40s and 50s and beyond". But in 2010, he dispelled any rumors of the band breaking up, saying:"I love what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> think that, yes, it might be tiring and complicated at times [...] we don't have any plans on disbanding any time soon". He has also turned down {{the idea of having a}} solo career, stating that [...] "there will never be a solo record. I would sooner have another band".|$|E

500|$|On March 30, 2011, Sheindlin was {{admitted}} to the hospital after she fainted on the set of her show while handling a case. She was released the next day, and it was later learned that she suffered a mini-stroke. Regarding her retirement, Sheindlin has stated that it's up to her viewers and when they tire of watching the program, which she believes will inevitably happen one day. As of the present, however, Sheindlin has stated that fans still seem to be interested and taking something out of the court show. Sheindlin admits the court show is [...] "seductive" [...] and hard to give up. Sheindlin said, [...] "I'm not tired.

500|$|In a 2009 interview, Sevigny {{reflected}} on her career, {{and said she}} was content with the level of stardom she had maintained: [...] "When I was in my early 20s, I went out with a British pop star, Jarvis Cocker; of course, pop stars have much more celebrity, I think, than actors even. They're really hunted by their fans much more. I remember driving around these remote towns in Wales and kids running after us in the street. I was like, 'This is horrible!' And I saw the effect it had on him, and that's when I decided I never wanted to be a celebrity at that level, and I think that's why I've chosen to do the work that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> just kind of work with directors that I love and try and do work that means something to me." ...|$|E

When {{asked if he would}} rather play the 19,600-seat Fleet Theater or the 900-seat Somerville Theater – both in Boston, Paul replied, [...] "I prefer to keep it intimate. That way people can see the whites of your eyes. I'd love to write a hit song and have it on the radio like [...] "American Pie" [...] or something, but I'm just gonna do what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> take what I can and run with it, because it's a hard business to have even what I have.

500|$|On New Years Day 2012, a {{low quality}} snippet of [...] "Lovebird" [...] leaked {{under the title}} [...] "Love Birds". After the song leaked, Lewis {{expressed}} her frustration at the song being available for listening to on the Internet, stating: [...] "I'm sad {{that one of my}} songs leaked. As an artist that holds music dear to my heart I would've liked to share it with u [...] when it's ready. I hope that you feel it like <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> when it's time to be released you'll still support it in the right way. Thank u [...] for the love." [...] That same month, it was announced that the album was expected to be released on 26 March 2012. Record executive Simon Cowell later publicly give his support for Glassheart, saying to Lewis that, although there had been a lengthy wait of two years for new music, the album was [...] "sensational", and that Lewis had [...] "never sounded better." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{completing}} [...] "Make It Happen", Carey eagerly presented the final {{song on the}} set list, [...] "I'll Be There". The way the song was arranged, Carey took Michael Jackson's lead, while Trey Lorenz sang the second lead, originally sung by Jermaine Jackson. After performing the sung alongside a very simple arrangement and minimal instrumentals, the back-up singers began humming {{to the tune of}} [...] "Can't Let Go", leading Carey to present [...] "another final" [...] song for the show. Several days after the concert, Carey sat down with Melinda Newman from Billboard, telling her of the experience recording the show, as well as her view on it from a creative perspective. She said [...] "Unplugged taught me a lot about myself because I tend to nitpick everything <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> make it a bit too perfect because I'm a perfectionist. I'll always go over the raw stuff, and now I've {{gotten to the point where}} I understand the raw stuff is usually better." ...|$|E
500|$|Yeats had {{a life-long}} {{interest}} in mysticism, spiritualism, occultism and astrology. He read {{extensively on the}} subjects throughout his life, {{became a member of}} the paranormal research organisation [...] "The Ghost Club" [...] (in 1911) and was especially influenced by the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. As early as 1892, he wrote: [...] "If I had not made magic my constant study I could not have written a single word of my Blake book, nor would The Countess Kathleen ever have come to exist. The mystical life is the centre of all that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> all that I think and all that I write." [...] His mystical interests—also inspired by a study of Hinduism, under the Theosophist Mohini Chatterjee, and the occult—formed much of the basis of his late poetry. Some critics disparaged this aspect of Yeats's work; W. H. Auden called it the [...] "deplorable spectacle of a grown man occupied with the mumbo-jumbo of magic and the nonsense of India." ...|$|E

500|$|Once {{she became}} Secretary of State, Clinton's image seemed to improve {{dramatically}} among the American public and {{become one of}} a respected world figure. She gained consistently high approval ratings (by 2011, the highest of her career except during the Lewinsky scandal), and her favorable-unfavorable ratings during 2010 and 2011 were the highest of any active, nationally prominent American political figure. A 2012 Internet meme, [...] "Texts from Hillary", was based around a photograph of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone and imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It achieved viral popularity among younger, technically adept followers of politics. Clinton sought to explain her popularity by saying in early 2012, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who I am and what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now. She continued {{to do well in}} Gallup's most admired man and woman poll and in 2015 she was named the most admired woman by Americans for a record fourteenth straight time and twentieth time overall.|$|E

Prior to the performing the song, Beyoncé met with United Nations leader Ban Ki-moon. Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Jan Eliasson, announced Beyoncé's performance giving a short introduction about the singer: [...] "Tonight [...] brings more than her stunning talents; she brings inspiration to help another person, to help another human being". He further recalled a [...] "dark day {{in the history of}} the U.N." [...] when 22 humanitarian workers lost their lives in a terrorist attack in Iraq on August 19, 2003 adding that the event and the World Humanitarian Day both honor those lost lives and encourage others to join the effort. He further interviewed guests whose relatives lost their lives in the accident. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos also appeared encouraging everyone to log on to the website WHD-IWasHere.org by August 19 and commit to doing one good act to help someone in need further saying, [...] "I told Beyoncé: It's great that we have her, because she can reach millions of people. I could spend the rest of my life doing what <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> I wouldn't reach a 10th of that number. And she said: 'Don't sell yourself short.'.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Antestor {{changed their}} style {{into a more}} modern black metal, and {{released}} their first set of new songs since The Return of the Black Death in an EP called Det tapte liv ("The Lost Life"). Det tapte liv concentrated less on the black metal aspects of Antestor's style, instead focusing more on instrumental songs. [...] However, it hinted at what the band was preparing for their 2005 full-length, The Forsaken. The cover arts for both releases were once again done by Kristian Wåhlin, and the cover for the EP depicts the Borgund Stave Church. Hellhammer played all drums on both of these releases. In {{an interview with the}} Russian metal site Metal Library on January 7, 2007, Blomberg was asked what did his Mayhem colleagues and record company think about his participation in Antestor, and he said: [...] "To be honest, it was a big 'fuck off!' to them all. I will repeat again that I decide what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> I play not only in black metal groups." [...] The band also asked Hellhammer to play live for them, but Blomberg refused. Hellhammer also went to state: [...] "In my opinion, black metal today is just music. I will tell you that neither I nor other members of Mayhem never really were against religion or something else. We are primarily interested in music." [...] Ronny Hansen commented on Blomberg's appearance: ...|$|E
