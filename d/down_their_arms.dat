5|$|In 1945, he {{was arrested}} by Urząd Bezpieczeństwa, the Polish {{communist}} secret police. He decided to cooperate with communist authorities {{in order to protect}} former members of resistance and he called for ex-AK soldiers who had joined the anti-communist underground to lay <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> in accordance with the amnesties of 1945 and 1947.|$|E
5|$|Davos Seaworth and the Night's Watch loyalists, who are {{guarding}} Jon Snow's body {{within a}} chamber in the castle, prepare themselves for battle when Alliser Thorne {{and his allies}} begin {{to break down the}} door. As they are about to break through, the outer gates of the Castle are breached by the giant Wun Wun, followed by Tormund Giantsbane and an army of Wildlings, who have returned with Dolorous Edd. Outnumbered, the Night's Watchmen lay <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms,</b> and Alliser and the mutineers are dragged off to the cells under Edd's orders.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson {{had arrived}} in North Carolina in early September 1780 to recruit troops for the Loyalist militia and protect the flank of Lord Cornwallis' main force. Ferguson issued a {{challenge}} to the rebel militias to lay <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> or suffer the consequences. In response, the Patriot militias led by Benjamin Cleveland, James Johnston, William Campbell, John Sevier, Joseph McDowell and Isaac Shelby rallied for an attack on Ferguson.|$|E
60|$|As for Tom Myers and {{his brother}} George, they just sat <b>down</b> and put <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> on the railing, and clapped <b>their</b> faces <b>down</b> on <b>their</b> <b>arms.</b> They cried all over their coat-sleeves, but kept as quiet as they could about it. Whenever these two boys had to cry before any {{of the rest of}} the school-fellows, they had learned to keep very quiet about it.|$|R

60|$|Further on the {{precautions}} became still greater. On {{the advanced}} pickets {{the men were}} in two divisions, relieving each other every two hours. Half remained on guard with fixed bayonets, the other half lay <b>down</b> by <b>their</b> <b>arms.</b> The picket sentinels were doubled.|$|R
5|$|In late October 1813, Hurshid Pasha {{declared}} a general amnesty for the rebels that had survived, though Karađorđe and some senior Serbian religious leaders were specifically exempted. Many rebel leaders accepted Hurshid Pasha's offer of amnesty {{and agreed to}} lay <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms,</b> the most notable of these being Miloš Obrenović, the rebel commander in Užice. A large number of Serb refugees subsequently returned to their homes, as did many of the Muslims that had been displaced in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|The British {{soldiers}} marched out {{and laid}} <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> {{in between the}} French and American armies, while many civilians watched. At this time, the troops {{on the other side}} of the river in Gloucester also surrendered. The British soldiers had been issued new uniforms hours before the surrender and until prevented by General O'Hara some threw down their muskets with the apparent intention of smashing them. Others wept or appeared to be drunk. In all, 8,000 troops, 214 artillery pieces, thousands of muskets, 24 transport ships, wagons and horses were captured.|$|E
5|$|The regiments of the Bar Confederation, whose {{executive}} board {{had been forced}} to leave Austria (which previously supported them) after Austria joined the Prusso-Russian alliance, did not lay <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms.</b> Many fortresses in their command held out as long as possible; Wawel Castle in Kraków fell only at the end of April; Tyniec fortress held until the end of July 1772; Częstochowa, commanded by Kazimierz Pułaski, held until late August. In the end, the Bar Confederation was defeated, with its members either fleeing abroad or being deported to Siberia by the Russians.|$|E

An enraged Kikuchiyo charges the hut; he is shot, but kills the bandit chief before dying.|$|R
5000|$|According to Williams, {{referring}} to the British charge, [...] "the impetuosity with which they advanced, firing and huzzaing, threw the whole body of militia into such a panic that they generally threw <b>down</b> <b>their</b> loaded <b>arms</b> and fled in the utmost consternation. The unworthy example of the Virginians was almost instantly followed by the North Carolinians." ...|$|R

The attacker holds the opponents <b>arms</b> <b>down</b> with <b>their</b> own <b>arms</b> for the pin.|$|R
5|$|Abdul Aziz's younger brother, Ghazi Abdul Rashid, {{had been}} {{negotiating}} {{with a government}} mediator. He claimed that the remaining students were willing to leave the mosque and lay <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms,</b> provided the government would grant them amnesty and not fire on them. Government officials were sceptical that Abdul Rashid would honour this agreement. In {{a telephone interview from}} a live transmission of Geo TV, Ghazi Abdul Rashid denied all the charges against him and reiterated his innocence. He further negotiated with the government for his safe passage and a guarantee that no harm would come to his followers inside the mosque. He also received a promise that his ailing mother would receive medical care.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1942 as a company, {{the unit}} {{consisted}} mainly of Yugoslav Volksdeutsche and recruits from South Tyrol. Although focused on anti-partisan operations, it also saw {{action in the}} wake of the Italian surrender when it moved to disarm Italian troops in Tarvisio and protect ethnic German communities in Italy. In addition, at the end of the war it successfully fought to keep passes into Austria open, allowing German units to escape the Balkans and surrender to British forces. The remnants of the unit became some of the last Germans to lay <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> when they surrendered to the British 6th Armoured Division on 9 May 1945.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{participated in}} the Battle of Princeton on January 3, 1777. After an initial setback, Washington rallied the American troops and led them in a {{successful}} charge against the British forces. After making a brief stand, the British fell back, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them fire upon the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, and broke it down. The British subsequently put a white flag outside one of the windows. 194 British soldiers {{walked out of the}} building and laid <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms,</b> thus ending the battle in an American victory.|$|E
60|$|During supper {{the strangers}} made {{themselves}} very agreeable. After supper, {{two of the}} stoutest of them arose, as if {{to go into the}} bush for more firewood. Suddenly these threw themselves upon and seized Dan and his comrade, who were reclining quietly on the ground. Before either could make even an attempt at self-defence they were overpowered by the Canadians, and held forcibly <b>down,</b> while <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> were securely bound to their sides with strips of deerskin.|$|R
60|$|During {{the day the}} {{companies}} took turn at outpost duty, but when night fell the line was strengthened, half the men being under rifles, while the rest lay <b>down</b> with <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> by <b>their</b> side, ready to fall in at a moment's notice. A dropping fire was kept up on both sides, but this was rather {{for the purpose of}} showing that they were on the alert than with any idea of harming the invisible foe.|$|R
5000|$|While General George Meade {{reportedly}} shouted that [...] "it's all over" [...] {{upon hearing}} the surrender was signed, roughly 175,000 Confederates {{remained in the}} field, but were mostly starving and disillusioned. Many of these were scattered throughout the South in garrisons or guerilla bands while the rest were concentrated in three major Confederate commands. Just as Porter Alexander had predicted, as news spread of Lee's surrender other Confederate commanders realized that {{the strength of the}} Confederacy was gone, and decided to lay <b>down</b> <b>their</b> own <b>arms.</b>|$|R
5|$|It was mid-September before {{news of the}} {{declaration}} of independence spread to the outer islands, and many Indonesians far from the capital Jakarta did not believe it. As the news spread, most Indonesians came to regard themselves as pro-Republican, and a mood of revolution swept across the country. External power had shifted; it would be weeks before Allied Forces entered Indonesia, and the Dutch were too weakened by World War II. The Japanese, on the other hand, were required by the terms of the surrender to both lay <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> and maintain order; a contradiction that some resolved by handing weapons to Japanese-trained Indonesians.|$|E
5|$|The French assault {{began at}} the same time, but they were halted by the abatis, which was {{undamaged}} by the artillery fire. The French began to hack at the abatis and a Hessian sentry came out and asked who was there. When there was no response, the sentry opened fire as did other Hessians on the parapet. The French soldiers fired back, and then charged the redoubt. The Germans charged the Frenchmen climbing over the walls but the French fired a volley, driving them back. The Hessians then took a defensive position behind some barrels but threw <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> and surrendered when the French prepared a bayonet charge.|$|E
5|$|At {{the edge}} of town, the 55th Regiment {{received}} orders from Mawhood to fall back and join the 40th Regiment in town. The 40th had taken up a position just outside town, {{on the north side}} of a ravine. The 55th formed up to the left of the 40th. The 55th sent a platoon to flank the oncoming Americans, but it was cut to pieces. When Sullivan sent several regiments to scale the ravine, they fell back to a breastwork. After making a brief stand, the British fell back again, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Alexander Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them blast away at the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, broke it down, and the British put a white flag outside one of the windows. Exactly 194 British soldiers walked out of the building and laid <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E
50|$|This sees {{a wrestler}} lock their {{opponent}} in a cravate and pull <b>down</b> with <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> {{so that the}} opponent is forced to bend over. The wrestler then positions the opponent {{so that they are}} facing across the body of the wrestler and with their head in front of the wrestlers chest. The wrestler then falls backwards and pulls upwards with the cravate, forcing the opponent off their feet and into the air and over the wrestler, landing on their neck and shoulders. This move was innovated by Chris Hero.|$|R
60|$|Geraldine {{suggested}} that they had better wait for either Mr. Audley or Wilmet to come in, but for this they had no patience, and ran <b>down</b> with <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> full of the branches, and their tongues going with {{the description of the}} night's carols, singing them with their sweet young voices as they moved about the room. Fernando knew now what Christmas meant, but the joy and exhilaration of the two children, seemed to him strange for such a bygone event. He asked them if they would have any treat.|$|R

5|$|In Braavos, Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) kills The Waif (Faye Marsay) {{and adds}} {{her face to}} the hall, stating to Jaqen H'ghar (Tom Wlaschiha) that she is {{returning}} to Westeros, no longer intending to be a Faceless Man. At Riverrun, Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) unsuccessfully negotiates Sansa's request for help from the Blackfish (Clive Russell), and Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) returns Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) to the castle, with Edmure commanding they throw <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> and surrender to the Lannisters. In King's Landing, Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) learns of her impending trial, and that she {{will not be able to}} demand a trial by combat by royal decree of King Tommen Baratheon (Dean-Charles Chapman). In Meereen, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) arrives, in the midst of an attack on the city by the wise masters of Yunkai, Astapor and Volantis. In the Riverlands, Sandor Clegane (Rory McCann) tracks down the Brotherhood Without Banners, who attempt to convince Clegane to join them.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} Germanicus reached Pannonia, Severus was {{attacked}} in Moesia, but successfully repelled the rebels. By the time Germanicus arrived the rebels had withdrawn to mountain fortresses {{from which they}} launched raids. The Romans were tactically unsuited at countering raids, so Tiberius had to utilize his auxiliary forces and divided his army into small detachments to cover more ground. Tiberius {{appears to have been}} conducting a war of attrition against the rebels who were now occupying strong defensive positions. In addition, the Romans began working to drive the rebels out of the countryside offering forgiveness to any tribes that would lay <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms,</b> and a scorched earth policy was implemented through which Tiberius may have been hoping to starve the enemy out. While most of his detachments saw little action at the time, Germanicus did defeat the Mazaei, a Dalmatian tribe.|$|E
5|$|Events at Ulm {{were now}} {{reaching}} a conclusion. On 15 October Ney's troops successfully charged the Michelsberg encampments {{and on the}} 16th the French began to bombard Ulm itself. Austrian morale was at a low point and Mack {{began to realize that}} there was little hope of rescue. On 17 October Napoleon's emissary, Ségur, signed a convention with Mack in which the Austrians agreed to surrender on 25 October if no aid came by that date. Gradually, however, Mack heard of the capitulations at Heidenheim and Neresheim and agreed to surrender five days before schedule on 20 October. Fifteen hundred troops from the Austrian garrison managed to escape, {{but the vast majority of}} the Austrian force marched out on 21 October and laid <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> without incident, all with the Grande Armée drawn up in a vast semicircle observing the capitulation (see infobox picture). The officers were permitted to leave, pending their signatures on a parole in which they agreed not to take up arms against France until they were exchanged. More than ten general officers were included in this agreement, including Mack, Johann von Klenau, Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, Prince Liechtenstein, and Ignaz Gyulai.|$|E

Mesmer would often conclude his treatments by playing some music on a glass armonica.|$|R
50|$|According to Thucydides, Hippias {{ordered the}} Greeks to lay <b>down</b> <b>their</b> {{ceremonial}} <b>arms</b> {{and then had}} them searched, arresting any found with concealed weapons. This was later denied by Aristotle, who said that this story {{was created by the}} democratic government in order to impress upon the people how much of a tyrant Hippias was. Aristotle also mentions that Aristogeiton was tortured in order to give the names of the conspirators in the plot. Enraged that Hippias hadn't killed him, Aristogeiton offered more names to Hippias in exchange for his hand in pledge. When Hippias put his hand on Aristogeiton's, Aristogeiton berated him for giving his hand to his brother's murderer — at which point Hippias stabbed Aristogeiton in rage.|$|R

5|$|Eyre, after {{receiving}} reinforcements, pursued Kunwar Singh's forces to Singh's palace in Jagdispur. Many civilians who were besieged in Arrah, including Wake (still commanding the 50 {{men of the}} Bengal Military Police Battalion), volunteered to serve with him. Although Singh's forces were routed and the palace occupied by 12 August, Singh had fled. Eyre's force destroyed most {{of the town of}} Jagdispur including the palace (in the nearby jungle), Singh's brothers' houses and a Brahmin temple. Eyre was publicly censured by Governor General Canning in The London Gazette for the temple's destruction. The Siege of Arrah marked the beginning of Singh's fight against the East India Company. Following Arrah he fought on, first leading his irregular forces to Lucknow, then keeping them together during an organised retreat back to Jagdispur. Singh died in April 1858. His irregular forces continued to fight, repelling an expedition sent to destroy them, until they finally laid <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> in November 1858 as part of the general amnesty. Following the general amnesty, unrest continued, and peace was not officially declared until 8 July 1859.|$|E
5|$|In 424 BC, Perdiccas {{began to}} play a {{prominent}} role in the Peloponnesian War by aiding the Spartan general Brasidas in convincing Athenian allies in Thrace to defect and ally with Sparta. After failing to convince Perdiccas II to make peace with Arrhabaeus of Lynkestis (a small region of Upper Macedonia), Brasidas agreed to aid the Macedonian fight against Arrhabaeus, although he expressed his concerns about leaving his Chalcidian allies to their own devices against Athens, as well as the fearsome Illyrian reinforcements arriving on the side of Arrhabaeus. The massive combined force commanded by Arrhabaeus apparently caused the army of Perdiccas II to flee in haste before the battle began, which enraged the Spartans under Brasidas, who proceeded to snatch pieces of the Macedonian baggage train left unprotected. Subsequently, Perdiccas II not only made peace with Athens but switched sides, blocking Peloponnesian reinforcements from reaching Brasidas via Thessaly. The treaty offered Athens economic concessions, but it also guaranteed internal stability in Macedonia since Arrhabaeus and other domestic detractors were convinced to lay <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> and accept Perdiccas II as their suzerain lord.|$|E
5|$|Daphnomeles {{participated in}} the {{subsequent}} conflicts against Tsar Samuel, but his greatest feat was the capture of the Bulgarian leader Ibatzes in 1018, {{for which he is}} given a prominent position in Skylitzes's work. Following the defeat at the Battle of Kleidion in 1015, Bulgarian resistance began to collapse. By 1018, most Bulgarian commanders had surrendered, and only Ibatzes, who had retreated with his followers to the royal estate of Pronista, a naturally strong and defensible highland position, continued to resist. He rejected both bribes and threats from the Byzantines, and for 55 days, the Byzantine army under Emperor Basil II remained encamped at Deabolis nearby, waiting for his surrender. At that point, and as local crowds gathered to Ibatzes's palace for the feast of the Dormition, Daphnomeles, now strategos of nearby Achrida, on his own initiative, resolved to end the impasse. With only two escorts, he climbed the way to the estate, and announced himself to Ibatzes. Ibatzes, believing that Daphnomeles would not have come alone unless he intended to forge an alliance against Basil, retreated with the strategos to a secluded wooded glade in the gardens for a private discussion. There, Daphnomeles and his two hidden associates sprang on the Bulgarian general, blinded him, and carried him to the upper story of the palace, through the assembled crowds who were too stunned to react. When the Bulgarians recovered, they gathered underneath the building crying for revenge. Daphnomeles, however, addressed them and managed to convince them of the futility of further resistance, and to lay <b>down</b> <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> and seek the emperor's pardon.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of Thursday 25 July 1946, Mrs Jeanne Jugand, the 35-year-old {{neighbour}} of the Carterons, became concerned as {{she had not seen}} the family for several days. She went to their farm, which was 100 metres from her own house, and saw worrying signs through the window. Mrs Jugand's husband then alerted the mayor and the police in Ambrault. The prosecutor's office in Châteauroux requested the assistance of the judicial police in Limoges. Several senior police officers and inspectors were dispatched to the scene. A locksmith broke open the door. The scene inside resembled an execution. The bodies of Kléber Carteron, his wife Alphonsine, their son André and another boy, Claude Godard, a ward of the state, were found face <b>down</b> with <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> and legs bound, all executed with a bullet {{to the back of the}} head.

60|$|As {{twilight}} fell {{a number}} of the enemy took possession of the top of a hill some twelve hundred yards away on the right and opened fire, to which the three guns of the artillery replied with shrapnel-shell. The guns ceased firing when darkness came on, but the enemy kept up an occasional fire all night. A drink of lime-juice and water was served out to all the men, who then lay <b>down,</b> with <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> in readiness to repel an attack, by the little wall. All night the enemy kept on beating tom-toms and occasionally yelling, approaching at times comparatively close to the position. Knowing, however, that the sentries were out in front, the men for the most part slept quietly in spite of the noise and firing. As the Arabs could fire only at random but two men were hit during the night.|$|R
60|$|The {{uprising}} of the Protestants of Holland was {{watched with}} the greatest interest by the Huguenots of France. It was known {{that several of the}} most influential Huguenot nobles had met, at Valery and at Chatillon, to discuss with the Prince of Conde and Admiral Coligny the question of again taking up arms in defence of their liberties. It was rumoured that the opinion of the majority was that the Huguenot standard should be again unfurled, and that this time there should be no laying <b>down</b> of <b>their</b> <b>arms</b> until freedom of worship was guaranteed to all; but that the admiral had used all his powers to persuade them that the time had not yet come, and that it was better to bear trials and persecutions, for a time, in order that the world might see they had not appealed to arms until driven to it by the failure of all other hope of redress of their grievances.|$|R
