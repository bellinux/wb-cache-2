40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{analyzed}} the main mechanisms in inter-firm governance {{present in a}} modular consortium {{as well as in}} an automotive industry <b>industrial</b> <b>condominium,</b> operating in Brazil [...] The data collection was carried out through interviews (in loco) in both automakers and suppliers. Modular consortium and <b>industrial</b> <b>condominium</b> not only involve collaborative agreements in manufacturing with suppliers but also embrace managerial aspects such as: trust, long-term contracts, reciprocity, reputation, channels of interdependence and formal and informal mechanisms of control. These contemporary forms of governance have generated new ways of organizing production and coordination in operations, based on cooperation, integration and inter-firm process control. For such, governance based on company inter-relationship usually operates seeking cooperative agreements so that it would permit quick access to information and technological innovations. These governance approaches contain structures to support exchange, resource interdependence, mutual lines of communication, economies of scale for research and joint production...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the possible contributions from modularity and <b>industrial</b> <b>condominiums</b> towards enhancing environmental {{performance in the}} automotive industry. The research described {{in this study is}} underpinned by a review of journal articles and books on the topics of: modularity of production systems; green operations practices, and the automotive industry and sustainability. The methodology is based on theoretical analysis of the contribution of the modular production system characteristics used in the automotive industry for Green Operations Practices (GOP). The following GOPs were considered: green buildings, eco design, green supply chains, greener manufacturing, and reverse logistics. The results are theoretical in nature; however, due to the small number of studies that investigate the relationship between modularity and sustainability, this work is relevant to increase knowledge in academic circles and among practitioners {{in order to understand the}} possible environmental benefits from modular production systems...|$|R

This article discuss the major findings of a study conducted in a representative supply chain of the auto industry to verify the use of contracts and how they affect the relationships of the companies in question. Based on an intentional sampling approach, a case study was made of an automaker that uses the <b>industrial</b> <b>condominium</b> configuration, two first tier suppliers operating inside the condominium, and a first tier supplier operating outside the condominium (a conventional supplier). Additionally, a basic framework was built to guide and define the key content of the research, which considered two premises and eleven parameters in the companies in question. The results pointed to some key findings, such as the fact that, whereas the formal contract in the conventional arm’s length relation has a “commercial ” bias, in the condominium relations it has a “management ” bias...|$|E
40|$|Em decorrência do aumento da competitividade do setor automobilístico, montadoras vêm adotando novas configurações produtivas, visando a uma maior integração na cadeia produtiva e ganhos para os participantes. A configuração produtiva escolhida pela montadora é um fator crucial e determinante para sua competitividade e que está diretamente associado à capacidade da montadora de entender e atender às expectativas dos clientes. Com a emergência dessas novas configurações organizacionais na indústria automobilística, houve uma perspectiva de que os mesmos se tornassem dominantes no futuro da indústria. Porém, o que se tem visto é que a adoção dessas novas configurações não tem ocorrido na velocidade prevista. Isso levanta questões relacionadas à condição de adoção dessas configurações e dos ganhos esperados pela implantação da estratégia de modularização se comparados aos tradicionais esquemas produtivos. Portanto, considerando essas premissas, o objetivo desta pesquisa é o de estudar como as configurações de Consórcio Modular (CM) e Condomínio Industrial (CI) refletem as prioridades competitivas na indústria automobilística brasileira.

In {{result of}} the {{increase}} of the competitiveness of the automobile sector, assembly plants have been adopting new productive configurations, aiming at a bigger integration in the productive chain and profits for the participants. The productive configuration chosen by the assembly plants is a crucial and determinative factor for its competitiveness and this is directly associated with {{the capacity of the}} assembly plant to understand and {{to take care of the}} expectation of the customers. With the emergency of these new organizational confirations in the automobile industry, there was a perspective that they could become dominant in the future of the industry. However, it has been observed that the adoption of these new configurations has not occured in the foreseen speed. This raises questions related to the condition of adoption of these configurations and the profits hoped with the implantation of the strategy of modularization compared with the traditional productive projects.

It is intended, by this way, to contribute for the agreement of the dynamics of adoption of these configurations in the Brazilian automobile industry. These productive configurations are present are present in two plants studied in this research: General Motors - (RS) - CI and Volkswagen (RJ) - CM. The suppliers of the CI are installed in the land of the assembly plant and its surroundings and are responsible for the supply just-in-time of the systems.
