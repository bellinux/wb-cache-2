5|$|London Underground {{has owned}} {{a small number}} of {{departmental}} vehicles which were not ballast motor or pilot motor cars. Between 1935 and 1950, the District line had a weed-killing train, initially consisting of a 1905-built B stock <b>driving</b> <b>motor</b> car and a control trailer. The two cars were kept at Ealing Common depot, but the control trailer was scrapped in 1937 and replaced by a second motor car, to provide more power. Weed-killing duties were not carried out during the Second World War, and the vehicles were not refurbished subsequently. They were scrapped in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Live BBC {{television}} coverage at 08:15 {{the following morning}} showed that although the whole train had been derailed, the rear carriages were standing nearly vertically on the sleepers and ballast. Standard class, the front five carriages, were the worst affected, and the rear four first class carriages were in better condition. The leading carriage, a <b>driving</b> <b>motor</b> coach, had headed down the embankment, and turned end-for-end as it fell. It was lying on its side {{at the foot of}} the embankment. The second carriage had jack-knifed against the first, breaking the coupling, and so had not followed it down the bank. This second carriage came to rest some distance further along the track, at a steep angle with one end in the air. The middle part of the train toppled sideways down the embankment. All the partially friction stir welded carriages remained structurally intact, with damage mainly confined to the crumple zones at their ends. None of the windows broke, and lighting remained in all the carriages. Most injuries occurred in the front two carriages. The driver, who had stayed at the controls (but had little option to move once the accident had started and had no prior indication of derailment), was trapped for about an hour while specialist cutting equipment was used to free him from his cab. The other three members of the crew were in the rear first class section of the train.|$|E

The trains are maintained at the Victoria line's Northumberland Park Depot, with Bombardier staff on site for warranty parts replacement. They were originally intended to have all-motored axles as in the 1992 Stock, so that they would have enough traction and acceleration for faster running times; however, it was later decided that 75% of motored axles would be sufficient, which reduced project costs by around Â£10 million (about 3.5% of the overall cost). They have mechanical-only Scharfenberg couplers.|$|E

25|$|Following its {{decision}} to build the Tawa Flat deviation to replace the original ex-Wellington & Manawatu Railway North Island Main Trunk alignment out of Wellington, the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) decided to convert the remaining 10.49km of track between Wellington and Johnsonville into an electrified suburban branch line. Six two-car trains comprising one <b>driving</b> <b>motor</b> car and one driving trailer were ordered from English Electric in 1936 to work the future Johnsonville Line, which formally 'opened' as a branch line on 2 July 1938 with the new electric trains inaugurating the service. The new trains were allocated as the DM class (<b>driving</b> <b>motor</b> cars) and the D class (non-motored driving trailer).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{dynamic model}} of the single-mass {{nonlinear}} harmonic vibration system and the electrical characteristics of two <b>driving</b> <b>motors,</b> the state space equations of the rotate speed and phase for the two <b>driving</b> <b>motors</b> had been deduced, and the harmonic control synchronization condition for the two <b>driving</b> <b>motors</b> had been discussed also. Then, based on the M-T transformation, the control synchronization scheme for the two <b>driving</b> <b>motors</b> to realize the synchronous movement under the conditions that the nonlinear vibration system harmonic vibrated had been designed in the paper.

40|$|Abstract An {{electric}} motor {{is the one}} of the most important parts in robot systems, which mainly drives the wheel of mobile robots or the joint of manipulators. According to the requirement of motor performance, the controller type and parameters vary. For the wheel <b>driving</b> <b>motors,</b> a speed tracking controller is used, while a position tracking controller is required for the joint <b>driving</b> <b>motors.</b> Moreover, if the mechanical parameters are changed or a different motor is used, we might have to tune again the controller parameters. However, for the beginners who are not familiar about the controller design, it is hard to design pertinently. In this paper, we develop a nominal robust controller model for the velocity tracking of wheel <b>driving</b> <b>motors</b> and the position tracking of joint <b>driving</b> <b>motors</b> based on th...|$|R

25|$|L13A/B - Created in 1974, this {{locomotive}} {{consisted of}} two 1938 Stock <b>Driving</b> <b>Motor</b> cars coupled back to back.

These gave the locomotive a very long shoegear span, since all four bogies were fitted with shoe beams, enabling it to cross gaps in the current rail at very low speeds. The locomotive was built so that L14A/B, which had proved the usefulness of a long shunting locomotive, could be scrapped.|$|E

500|$|To provide {{services}} over the [...] extension, the CLR ordered 24 additional <b>driving</b> <b>motor</b> carriages from the Brush Company, which, when delivered in 1917, were first borrowed by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway {{for use in}} place of carriages ordered for its extension to Watford Junction. The new carriages were the first for tube-sized trains that were fully enclosed, without gated platforms at the rear, and were provided with hinged doors in the sides to speed-up passenger loading times. To operate with the new stock the CLR converted 48 existing carriages, providing a total of 72 carriages for twelve six-car trains. Modifications made while in use on the Watford extension meant that the new carriages were not compatible {{with the rest of}} the CLR's fleet and they became known as the Ealing stock.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel electronic differential design for highperformance electric vehicles (EVs) with independent <b>driving</b> <b>motors.</b> The {{aim of this}} design is to achieve neutral-steer in intense driving scenarios. The proposed method employs a closed-loop control system that constantly regulates the torque commands sent to the independent <b>driving</b> <b>motors.</b> These commands are generated to tune the torque difference between left and right <b>driving</b> <b>motors</b> at the amount that leads to neutral-steer. Real vehicle parameters and real tyre testing data are employed in extensive simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the new electronic differential works in principle and can endow the EV with a close-to-neutral steer characteristic, which is of great significance to high-performance vehicles in challenging driving conditions. Also, comparative simulations demonstrate how the proposed method can outperform competing methods in terms of steering performance in various scenarios, while maintaining the dynamic stability of the vehicle...|$|R

500|$|In the Singapore High Court case of Pillay, the Public Prosecutor appealed {{against a}} magistrate's {{decision}} that rules requiring {{people to pay}} a fee for a permit before <b>driving</b> <b>motor</b> vehicles into {{an area of the}} city designated as the [...] "restricted zone" [...] were ultra vires section 90(1) of the Road Traffic Act, the relevant part of which stated: [...] "The Minister may make rules... generally for the purpose of carrying this Act into effect...". The respondent submitted that {{the primary purpose of the}} rules was to impose a fee on vehicles entering the restricted zone, and that section 90(1) did not empower the Minister to do so. The Court disagreed, holding that the Act empowered the Minister to make rules to regulate road traffic, and the purpose of the rules in question was not fee collection but to alleviate traffic congestion within the restricted zone. The fee imposed was [...] "the means adopted to achieve the desired purpose and is merely incidental thereto". Law professor Thio Li-ann has commented that the Court's judgment, which appears to accept that an administrative measure need not relate directly to the purpose of a statute but may be incidental to it, [...] "effectively gives the public body a great latitude to manoeuvre and formulate means which may have only a bare nexus with the statutory purpose".|$|E
