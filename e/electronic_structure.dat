5|$|In {{the same}} year that Brønsted and Lowry {{published}} their theory, G. N. Lewis proposed an alternative theory of acid–base reactions. The Lewis theory is based on <b>electronic</b> <b>structure.</b> A Lewis base is defined as a compound that can donate an electron pair to a Lewis acid, a compound that can accept an electron pair. Lewis's proposal gives an explanation to the Brønsted–Lowry classification in terms of <b>electronic</b> <b>structure.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chemically, {{actinium}} {{is similar}} to lanthanum, which is explained by their similar ionic radii and <b>electronic</b> <b>structure.</b> Like lanthanum, actinium has oxidation of +3, but it is less reactive and has more pronounced basic properties. Among other trivalent actinides Ac3+ is least acidic, i.e. has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions.|$|E
5|$|Cerium has a {{variable}} <b>electronic</b> <b>structure.</b> The {{energy of the}} 4f electron is nearly {{the same as that}} of the outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and only a small amount of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valence states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. It appears that the valence changes from about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed.|$|E
40|$|By using a {{comprehensive}} form of scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we have revealed detailed quasi-particle <b>electronic</b> <b>structures</b> in transition metal dichalcogenides, including the quasi-particle gaps, critical point energy locations, and their {{origins in the}} Brillouin zones. We show that single layer WSe surprisingly has an indirect quasi-particle gap with the conduction band minimum located at the Q-point (instead of K), albeit the two states are nearly degenerate. We have further observed rich quasi-particle <b>electronic</b> <b>structures</b> of transition metal dichalcogenides {{as a function of}} atomic structures and spin-orbit couplings. Such a local probe for detailed <b>electronic</b> <b>structures</b> in conduction and valence bands will be ideal to investigate how <b>electronic</b> <b>structures</b> of transition metal dichalcogenides are influenced by variations of local environment...|$|R

5|$|Theoretical {{condensed}} matter physics {{involves the}} use of theoretical models to understand properties of states of matter. These include models to study the electronic properties of solids, such as the Drude model, the Band structure and the density functional theory. Theoretical models have also been developed to study the physics of phase transitions, such as the Ginzburg–Landau theory, critical exponents and the use of mathematical methods of quantum field theory and the renormalization group. Modern theoretical studies involve the use of numerical computation of <b>electronic</b> <b>structure</b> and mathematical tools to understand phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, topological phases, and gauge symmetries.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is {{an element}} in which the 5f {{electrons}} are the transition border between delocalized and localized; it is therefore {{considered one of the}} most complex elements. The anomalous behavior of plutonium is caused by its <b>electronic</b> <b>structure.</b> The energy difference between the 6d and 5f subshells is very low. The size of the 5f shell is just enough to allow the electrons to form bonds within the lattice, on the very boundary between localized and bonding behavior. The proximity of energy levels leads to multiple low-energy electron configurations with near equal energy levels. This leads to competing 5fn7s2 and 5fn−16d17s2 configurations, which causes the complexity of its chemical behavior. The highly directional nature of 5f orbitals is responsible for directional covalent bonds in molecules and complexes of plutonium.|$|E

40|$|Appendix missing. Complete copy {{held in the}} Manuscripts Reading Room, Cambridge University Library, {{classmark}} PhD. 33388. Functional heterojunctions {{in organic}} electronic devices are interfaces formed either between a conducting electrode and an organic semiconductor or between two different organic semiconductors in blended and multilayered structures. This thesis is primarily concerned with the energy level alignment and the interfacial <b>electronic</b> <b>structures</b> at functional heterojunctions encountered in electronic devices made with solution-processable semiconducting polymers. Investigations on the <b>electronic</b> <b>structures</b> across these heterointerfaces are performed with the combined use of electromodulation and photoemission spectroscopic techniques. Electromodulation and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopic techniques enable direct determination of the surface work functions of electrodes at the electrode/semiconducting polymer interfaces. We overcame the inherent problems faced by electromodulation spectroscopy, which undermine accurate determination of interfacial <b>electronic</b> <b>structures,</b> by performing electroabsorption (EA) measurements at reduced temperatures. We showed in this thesis that low-temperature EA spectroscopy is a surface sensitive technique that can determine the interface <b>electronic</b> <b>structures</b> in electrode/polymer semiconductor/electrode diodes. Using this technique, we demonstrated that the energy level alignments in these solution-processed organic electronic devices {{are determined by the}} surface work functions of passivated metals rather than by those of clean metals encountered in ultrahigh vacuum. This thesis also discloses our studies on the <b>electronic</b> <b>structures</b> in polymeric diodes with type II donor-acceptor heterojunctions using the EA spectroscopy. We showed that minimising meausurement temperature and attenuating EA illumination intensity enable accurate determinations of the <b>electronic</b> <b>structures</b> in these devices. We demonstrated that the <b>electronic</b> <b>structures</b> and the performance characteristics of multilayered polymer light-emitting diodes are also determined by the surface work functions of passivated metals. Our investigations confirm that electronic doping of the organic active layers, rather than minimisation of the Schottky barriers at electrode/polymer contacts, holds the key in realising high-performance organic light-emitting devices...|$|R
