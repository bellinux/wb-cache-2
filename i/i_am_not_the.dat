500|$|While Rand {{was working}} as a script reader for Paramount Pictures, her boss put her in touch with the Bobbs-Merrill Company. A {{recently}} hired editor, Archibald Ogden, liked the book, but two internal reviewers gave conflicting opinions. One said it was a great book that would never sell; the other said it was trash but would sell well. Ogden's boss, Bobbs-Merrill president D.L. Chambers, decided to reject the book. Ogden responded by wiring to the head office, [...] "If this is not the book for you, then <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> editor for you." [...] His strong stand won Rand the contract on December 10, 1941. She also got a $1,000 advance so she could work full-time to complete the novel by January 1, 1943.|$|E

500|$|Several of the show's crew praise Bumpass for his {{performance}} and similitude to the character. Kenny called Bumpass [...] "brilliant" [...] and said, [...] " [...] {{is sort of}} like Squidward". Staff writer Kent Osborne said, [...] "I remember thinking about how much Rodger talks and acts like Squidward. That's why it's such a good voice—he's so connected to it". However, Bumpass said, [...] "I'm not him and he's not me, but what I'm required to do for him and what I am enabled to do for him is what makes it like me.

500|$|Although {{he was a}} striker, Dickov {{was better}} known for his {{tenacity}} than his goal-scoring exploits. In a 2003 interview with the Independent on Sunday he provided a summary of his playing style: [...] "The ability to battle {{is one of the}} main parts of my game. I know my limits. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> sort who gets the ball and is then going to beat five or six players and stick it in the top corner from God knows where.

[...] Rio Ferdinand was mentioning his name as the biggest headache to deal with on the pitch. His combative approach resulted in Manchester City manager Joe Royle naming him [...] "The Wasp", and during his time at Leicester he was known as [...] "The Pest".|$|E
500|$|In his {{appearances}} on The Howard Stern Show, he was frequently challenged {{to defend his}} ratings. Ebert stood by his opinions with one notable exception– when Stern pointed out that Ebert had given The Godfather Part II a three-star rating in 1974, but had subsequently given The Godfather Part III {{three and a half}} stars. Ebert later added The Godfather Part II to his [...] "Great Movies" [...] list in October 2008 stating that his original review has often been cited as proof of his [...] "worthlessness" [...] but he still had not changed his mind and would not change a word of his original review. When reviewing the 2009 remake of The Last House on the Left, Ebert noted how he had given the controversial 1972 original three and a half stars and declined to make a comparison between the two versions: [...] "I wrote that original [...] "Last House" [...] review 37 years ago. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> same person.

30|$|It {{is clear}} from 41 and 42 that Huang (1988) and Huang et al.

In fact, Huang (1992 : 119) even analyzes V-DE constructions like i as having a similar structure to 41. In this analysis, Lisi in <b>i</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> syntactic subject of the de-part, either. Instead, the de-part involves a “Pro” and underlyingly Lisi is the “external object” of the Vʹ “ku-de Pro hen shangxin”.|$|R

2500|$|Describing why he {{continued}} using the Guns N' Roses name, instead of labeling the upcoming album an 'Axl Rose solo album', Rose stated [...] "It is something I lived by before {{these guys were}} in it.

I contemplated letting go of that, but it doesn't feel right in any way. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> person who chose to try to kill it and walked away. It's not an Axl Rose album, even if it's what I wanted it to be. Everybody is putting everything they've got into singing and building. Maybe I'm helping steer it to what it should be built like." [...] Also in the interview, Rose attributed the breakup of the old lineup to drug addictions and 'an effort from inside the band to destroy him', stating [...] "There was an effort to bring me down. It was a king-of-the-mountain thing," [...] and that he [...] "needed to take control to survive". Rose also described the dissolution as [...] "a divorce".|$|E
2500|$|Relations {{between new}} {{producer}} Freiberger and the Year One veterans were strained. Landau complained about stories he felt were light-weight or absurd {{when compared to}} the previous year's efforts. He wrote on the cover of a script: [...] "I'm not going out on a limb for this show because I'm not in accord with what you're (Freiberger) doing as a result... etc. I don't think I even want to do the promos—I don't want to push the show any more as I have in the past. It's not my idea of what the show should be. It's embarrassing to me if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> star of it and in the way I feel it should be. This year should be more important to it, not less important to it... I might as well work less hard in all of them." [...] Johnny Byrne said that Freiberger was a good man and good producer, but not good for Space: 1999. He had gotten them a second year after the cancellation, but the changes he made did not benefit the programme.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNADH-supported {{generation}} of H 2 O 2 by permeabilized rat heart mitochondria was partially prevented by the specific complex I-directed inhibitor, NADH-OH, and was significantly stimulated by ammonium. Ammonium {{did not affect}} H 2 O 2 production by complex I in coupled submitochondrial particles. The soluble mitochondrial matrix protein fraction catalyzed NADH-dependent H 2 O 2 production, which was greatly (∼ 10 -fold) stimulated by ammonium. We conclude that complex <b>I</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> major contributor to mitochondrial superoxide (hydrogen peroxide) generation {{and that there are}} specific ammonium-sensitive NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase(s) in the mitochondrial matrix which are responsible for mitochondrial H 2 O 2 production...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThat NK {{cell receptors}} engage fast-evolving MHC class I ligands {{suggests}} that they, too, evolve rapidly. To test this hypothesis, {{the structure and}} class I specificity of chimpanzee KIR and CD 94 :NKG 2 receptors were determined and compared to their human counterparts. The KIR families are divergent, with only three KIR conserved between chimpanzees and humans. By contrast, CD 94 :NKG 2 receptors are conserved. Whereas receptors for polymorphic class <b>I</b> <b>are</b> divergent, those for nonpolymorphic class <b>I</b> <b>are</b> conserved. Although chimpanzee and human NK cells exhibit identical receptor specificities for MHC-C, they are mediated by nonorthologous KIR. These results demonstrate the rapid evolution of NK cell receptor systems and imply that “catching up” with class <b>I</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only force driving this evolution...|$|R
