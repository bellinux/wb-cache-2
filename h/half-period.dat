40|$|Self-sustained {{oscillations}} in the propane oxidation over {{a nickel}} foil were studied in situ {{with the use}} of ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) coupled with on-line mass-spectrometry and gas chromatography (GC). Regular oscillations of a relaxation type were observed at 0. 5 mbar in the temperature range of 600 – 750 °C in oxygen-deficient conditions. CO, CO 2, H 2, H 2 O, and propylene were detected as products. CO selectivity in active <b>half-periods</b> achieved 98 % decreasing to 40 – 60 % in inactive <b>half-periods.</b> It has been found that the chemical state of the catalyst drastically changes together with the oscillations of the catalytic activity. According to the Ni 2 p and O 1 s core-level spectra measured in situ, the active catalyst surface is represented by metallic nickel, whereas it is covered with a layer of NiO with a thickness of at least 3 nm during the inactive <b>half-periods.</b> It means that the oscillations in the propane oxidation over nickel are originated from the reversible bulk oxidation of Ni to NiO. We suggest that the propane oxidation over the metallic Ni surface occurs via the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, whereas the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism prevails when the reaction proceeds over NiO. The switching between the metallic surface and the oxide shows a significant change in the catalytic activity. According to GC measurements the activity of metallic nickel is approximately 40 -fold higher than that of NiO...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of self-sustained reaction-rate oscillations {{in the catalytic}} oxidation of propane over a nickel foil has been studied in situ using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy coupled with online mass spectrometry and gas chromatography. Changes in the effective surface area and in the catalyst morphology under reaction conditions have been examined by scanning electron microscopy and a krypton adsorption technique. It is shown that the regular kinetic oscillations arise under oxygen-lean conditions. CO, CO 2, H 2, H 2 O, and propylene are detected as products. The conversion of propane oscillates in a range from 1 % to 23 %. During the <b>half-periods</b> with high activity, the main reaction pathway is the partial oxi- dation of propane: selectivity toward CO achieves 98 %. In contrast, during the <b>half-periods</b> with low activity, the reaction proceeds through three competitive pathways: the partial oxidation of propane, the total oxidation of propane, and the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The driving force for the self-sustained kinetic oscillations is the periodic reoxidation of nickel. According to the Ni 2 p and O 1 s core-level spectra measured in situ, the high-active catalyst surface is represented by metallic nickel, whereas during the inactive <b>half-periods</b> the catalyst surface {{is covered with a}} thick layer of NiO. The intensity of O 1 s spectra follows the oscillations of O 2 in the gas phase during the oxidation of propane. It is found that during the induction period before the regular oscillations appear, a rough and porous structure develops because of strong reconstruction of the catalyst surface. The thickness of the recon- structed layer is approximately 10 – 20 μm. This process is accompanied with at least an 80 -fold increase in the effective surface area compared with a clean, non-treated nickel foil, which undoubtedly leads to a drastic {{increase in the number of}} active sites. We believe that it is the main reason for the induction period always being observed before the appearance of self-sustained oscillations in the catalytic oxidation of light hydrocarbons over catalysts with a low specific surface area (single crystals, foils, or wires). Moreover, without such reconstruction, the oscillations cannot arise due to low activity of such catalysts...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} the symmetries of Darboux's equations (1882) on tori. We extend Ince's work (1940) by developing new infinite series expansions {{in terms of}} Jacobi elliptic functions around {{each of the four}} regular singular points of the Darboux equation which are located at the four <b>half-periods</b> of the torus. The symmetry group of the Darboux equation is given by the Coxeter group B_ 4 G_I_Γ G_II where the actions of G_I correspond to the sign changes of the parameters in the solutions of the equations, which have no effective changes on the equation itself, while the actions of G_II permute the four <b>half-periods</b> of the torus, which are described by a short-exact sequence. We are able to clarify the symmetries of the equation when ordered bases of the underlying torus change. Our results show that it is much more transparent to consider the symmetries of the Darboux equation on a torus than on the Riemann sphere CP^ 1 as was usually considered by earlier researchers such as Maier (2007). We list the symmetry tables of the Darboux equation in both the Jacobian form and Weierstrass form. A consolidated list of 192 solutions of the Darboux equation is also given. We then consider the symmetries of several classical equations (e. g. Lamé equation) all of which are special cases of the Darboux equation. Those terminating solutions of the Darboux equation generalize the classical Lamé polynomials. Comment: 27 pages, 6 tables. Some minor changes. One additional reference added.

40|$|The results {{obtained}} in part I are interpreted {{in terms of}} the viscosity field arising from independent processes of directional ordering for magnetic defects dispersed in the amorphous structure and interacting with the magnetization vector.

This difficulty is overcome by deriving a general relationship between the magnetic‐induction decay and the viscosity field kinetics for an arbitrary number of <b>half‐periods</b> of the square‐wave field. The agreement of our theory with the experimental results turns out to be quite satisfactory.

The integrable Schrödinger operators often have a singularity on the real line, which creates problems for their spectral analysis. A classical example is the Lamé operator L = −d^ 2 /dx^ 2 + m(m + 1) ℘(x), where ℘(z) is the classical Weierstrass elliptic function. We study the spectral properties of its complex regularisations of the form L = −d^ 2 /dx^ 2 + m(m + 1) ω^ 2 ℘(ωx + z_ 0), z_ 0 ∈ C, where ω {{is one of the}} <b>half-periods</b> of ℘(z). In several particular cases we show that all closed gaps lie on the infinite spectral arc. In the second part we develop a theory of complex exceptional orthogonal polynomials corresponding to integrable rational and trigonometric Schrödinger operators, which may have a singularity on the real line. In particular, we study the properties of the corresponding complex exceptional Hermite polynomials related to Darboux transformations of the harmonic oscillator, and exceptional Laurent orthogonal polynomials related to trigonometric monodromy-free operators...|$|R
