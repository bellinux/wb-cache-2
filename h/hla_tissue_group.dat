40|$|Celiac disease (CD) is {{strongly}} related to human leukocyte antigens (HLA) genes. The incidence of CD is very low in patients without the HLA-DQ 2. 5 and HLA-DQ 8 leukocyte antigens. This study presents two families with CD and shows that the disease might be familial. The determination of <b>HLA</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>groups</b> is important and family screening tests may lead to early diagnose of the disease. In both of the families, the patients’ siblings and fathers were asymptomatic, but diagnoses were made after family screening tests. <b>HLA</b> <b>tissue</b> typing was performed in all family members. The patients, siblings and fathers carried the HLADR 3 -DQA 1 * 0501 -DQB 1 * 0201 <b>tissue</b> <b>groups</b> in both two families while this <b>tissue</b> <b>group</b> was not present in the mothers. As CD {{is strongly}} related to certain HLA groups and has a genetic predisposition, all members of a family must be screened when a case of CD is diagnosed in any family member.

40|$|AbstractDendritic {{cells have}} been used {{effectively}} to select for human cytomegalovirus (CMV) -specific T cells for immunotherapy applications. The ability to process and present relevant major histocompatibility complex class I and II peptides to T cells makes them ideal for selecting CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells regardless of <b>HLA</b> <b>tissue</b> type. This study compared the generation of CMV-specific T cells by using dendritic cells loaded with either CMV pp 65 (495 – 503) peptide or CMV lysate or transduced with adenovirus encoding the pp 65 gene (Ad 5 pp 65 GFP) for the generation of CD 4 + and CD 8 + CMV-specific T cells in HLA-A 2 + and HLA-A 2 − donors. In HLA-A 2 + donors, CD 8 + tetramer+ T cells increased with all antigens but were greatest in peptide- and Ad 5 pp 65 GFP-stimulated T cells. The CD 4 +/CD 8 + ratio in the stimulated T-cell cultures proved {{to be dependent on}} the antigen used. CMV lysate-stimulated cells were primarily CD 4 +, whereas peptide- and Ad 5 pp 65 GFP-stimulated cultures were mostly CD 8 +. Analysis of cells from lysate-stimulated or gene-transduced-stimulated cultures showed expansion of CMV-specific CD 4 + T cells, indicating that major histocompatibility complex class II peptides were present in both antigens. Furthermore, CMV-specific T cells were generated from HLA-A 2 − donors by using Ad 5 pp 65 GFP transduction or CMV lysate stimulation and were able to recognize a pp 65 peptide restricted to the HLA-B 35 allele. These data indicate that either CMV lysate or adenovirus encoding CMV antigenic genes may be useful for the generation of both CD 4 + and CD 8 + CMV-specific T cells in donors irrespective of <b>HLA</b> <b>tissue</b> type and may be applicable to clinical immunotherapy...|$|R

METHODS: An ultra performance liquid chromatography and linear trap quadrupole-Orbitrap XL-mass spectrometry platform was used to analyze endogenous metabolites in the homogenate of central tumor tissue, adjacent tissue and distant tissue obtained from 10 HBV-related HCC patients. After pretreatment with Mzmine software, including peak detection, alignment and normalization, the acquired data were treated with Simca-P+software to establish multivariate statistical analysis based on a pattern recognition technique and characteristic metabolites highly correlated with changing trends in metabolic profiling were selected and further identified. RESULTS: Based on data acquired using Mzmine software, a principal component analysis model (R 2 X = 66. 9 %, Q 2 = 21. 7 %) with 6 principal components and an orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis model (R 2 X = 76. 5 %, R 2 Y = 93. 7 %, Q 2 = 68. 7 %) with 2 predicted principal components and 5 orthogonal principal components were established in the three <b>tissue</b> <b>groups.</b> Forty-nine ions were selected, 33 ions passed the 2 related samples nonparametric test (P < 0. 05) and 14 of these were further identified as characteristic metabolites that showed significant differences in levels between the central tumor <b>tissue</b> <b>group</b> and distant tumor <b>tissue</b> <b>group,</b> including 9 metabolites (L-phenylalanine, glycerophosphocholine, lysophosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylethanolamines and chenodeoxycholic acid glycine conjugate) which had been reported as serum metabolite biomarkers for HCC diagnosis in previous research, and 5 metabolites (beta-sitosterol, quinaldic acid, arachidyl carnitine, tetradecanal, and oleamide) which had not been reported before.
