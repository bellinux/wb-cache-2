The new party was formed in May 1917 and had around 20,000 members. It would soon change name and become the first Communist Party of Sweden. They launched a newspaper, Politiken, in which they wrote and published texts by other international communist leaders.|$|E
25|$|With the {{offensive}} already {{bogged down in}} unseasonably early wet weather, French (14 August 1917) claimed to Riddell (managing director of the News of the World, and likely to pass on French's views to Lloyd George) that Robertson was “anxious to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of the military power into his own hands, {{that he is a}} capable organiser but not a great soldier, and we are suffering from a lack of military genius”. Lloyd George suggested that all Robertson’s plans be submitted to a committee of French, Wilson and one other, although Wilson thought this “ridiculous and unworkable”.|$|E
25|$|Despite of the {{recently}} gained independence from Russia, the Russian military was still present in Helsinki but did not {{take part in the}} Civil War. The company had receivables worth of 3,000,000 marks from the Russian Navy. As it was impossible to get the payment from the local military council, Schwindt travelled to Petrograd. By help of admiral Maximov he succeeded to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> payment in rubles, but managed to change just one third of it into Finnish marks, which was then smuggled to Helsinki into a safe place. Schwindt had to leave {{the rest of the money}} to Petrograd, where he made deposit agreements with the local branches of Branobel and ASEA. After this Schwindt returned to Finland through Sortavala and joined to the White Guard. ASEA paid the saved amount to Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works, but the sum saved to Branobel, over 1.1 million rubles, was lost due to the revolution. The collected money enabled paying salaries of the white-collar personnel and dividend to the owners.|$|E

500|$|Theroux {{described}} approaching filming without entirely {{understanding what}} the plot was about: [...] "You <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> script, {{but he might}} as well withhold the scenes you're not in, because the whole turns out to be more mystifying than the parts. David welcomes questions, but he won't answer any of them... You work kind of half-blindfolded. If he were a first-time director and hadn't demonstrated any command of this method, I'd probably have reservations. But it obviously works for him." [...] Theroux noted that the only answer Lynch did provide was that he was certain that Theroux's character, a Hollywood director, was not autobiographical of Lynch. Watts stated that she tried to bluff Lynch by pretending she had the plot figured out, and that he delighted in the cast's frustration.|$|E
500|$|Christman {{contacted}} the Scientology critics based in Clearwater, and arranged flight transportation to Florida. She {{arrived at the}} airport in California to find that her flight was cancelled. Her former supervisor, Janet Weiland, was waiting for her close to the ticket counter, and tried to convince her to remain in the organization. Christman eventually got on a flight to Tampa, Florida, but was met at the gate when she arrived by agents of Scientology. Tampa police were notified, and escorted Christman safely away from the Scientologists. While a member of Scientology, Christman had given over $1 million to the organization; she used her inheritance money to pay for coursework. She commented to the St. Petersburg Times of Florida about the thought process she underwent after leaving the organization, [...] "When you get out and you <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> thing, you're like, 'What was I thinking?'. I know the people inside are brainwashed and they're laughing at me. But to me, the truth is, I'm free. I can do what I want. I can say what I want." ...|$|E
500|$|Barrons {{attained}} general officer {{status in}} 2008, {{when he was}} promoted to the substantive rank of major general and appointed Deputy Commanding General, Multi-National Corps – Iraq. He was posted to Baghdad, where he had responsibility for overseeing joint operations conducted by the multinational force and the Iraqi Army. Having served in Iraq, he returned to the UK to take up a staff post in April 2009 as chief of staff to the NATO Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), but the appointment was short-lived as, in October 2009, he deployed to Afghanistan at short notice to establish a force reintegration unit, {{part of an effort to}} persuade Taliban fighters to rejoin society by offering alternatives to fighting, such as jobs and training—a role for which he was hand-picked by U.S. Army General Stanley A. McChrystal, then commander of all troops in Afghanistan. Barrons defended the controversial scheme in interviews, saying that it was not [...] "about buying insurgents off the battlefield" [...] and that [...] "the idea is that you <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> community benefiting and turning against the insurgency". In a later interview, Barrons also said [...] "I am absolutely convinced it can be done, and that the time is right. This is an opportunity the Afghan people aren't going to get again.

500|$|Carter {{considered}} Revelation to {{be a good}} {{middle ground}} between Birthright and Conquest, and praised its story after moving beyond the conceit of its premise. Corriae was highly positive about the game: while finding the initial premise rather contrived, she greatly enjoyed the resultant drama and found the story better than that of Birthright and Conquest. She also praised the game for its gameplay and variety. Keller said the story of Revelation [...] "keeps players on their toes", while praised the gameplay for finding a middle ground between the two physical releases. She called it [...] "a fulfilling conclusion" [...] to Fates. While generally positive about the game as a whole, Sheridan was rather critical of the fact that players needed to buy Revelation as DLC to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> story. Gwaltney was less favorable than he was about Birthright and Conquest: while he enjoyed the early tension of a limited party, the ability to expand and strengthen the party sapped away the tension, while he found the story [...] "rather ho-hum and generic" [...] after the more impactful stories of the first two versions. Sullivan of IGN greatly enjoyed the combination of characters and gameplay from Birthright and Conquest, but shared her opinion of the central plot device with Corriae. Carsillo found Revelation the most satisfying due to the obscuring of key plot points in the other versions despite Birthright and Conquest offering greater character insight, along with positively noting its gameplay balance between the two physical releases.|$|E
