50|$|The red acouchi, Myoprocta acouchy, is {{a species}} of rodent in the acouchi genus, {{part of the family}} <b>Dasyproctidae,</b> from South America. It is found in the Guyanan subregion of the Amazon biome, {{including}} Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Brazil, east of the Rio Branco and mainly north of the Amazon, with a few records from south of the Amazon. In the past, some authors have applied the name M. acouchy to the green acouchi instead and used M. exilis for the red acouchi, but this is now obsolete.|$|E
50|$|There is much {{confusion}} in the nomenclature of this and related species; see agouti. In particular, the popular term agouti or common agouti normally refers to species of the distinct Dasyprocta genus (such as the Central American agouti, Dasyprocta punctata). Sometimes the word agouti is also used for a polyphyletic grouping uniting the families Cuniculidae and <b>Dasyproctidae,</b> which, besides the pacas and common agoutis, includes also the acouchis (Myoprocta). Cuniculus is the appropriate genus name instead of Agouti based on a 1998 ruling of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature as the Lowland Paca's genus.|$|E
50|$|The Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) is {{a species}} of agouti from the family <b>Dasyproctidae.</b> The main portion of its range is from Chiapas and the Yucatan Peninsula (southern Mexico), through Central America, to northwestern Ecuador, Colombia and far western Venezuela. A highly disjunct {{population}} is found in southeastern Peru, far southwestern Brazil, Bolivia, western Paraguay and far northwestern Argentina. The disjunct population has been treated as a separate species, the brown agouti (Dasyprocta variegata), but a major review of the geographic variation is necessary. The Central American agouti has also been introduced to Cuba, Bahamas, Jamaica, Hispaniola and the Cayman Islands.|$|E
50|$|These {{animals have}} no {{distinct}} breeding season, and females generally have about 1 to 3 young. The gestation period is 104 to 120 days. On average, it takes 20 weeks {{for the young}} to be weaned. They live in pairs or family groups of the parents and little ones. They need large areas for food, breeding, and territory. It is hard to keep the animal in captivity for that reason. Most animals in the family <b>Dasyproctidae</b> mate once or twice, and this is presumed to be true for this species as well. This species lives 15-20 yrs in captivity.|$|E
50|$|The green acouchi (Myoprocta pratti) is {{a species}} of rodent in the acouchi genus, {{part of the family}} <b>Dasyproctidae,</b> from South America. Its {{distribution}} is in western Amazonia, west of the Rios Negro and Madeira, in northwestern Brazil, northeastern Peru, eastern Ecuador, southeastern Colombia, and southern Venezuela. There is substantial variation within this range, and the Green Acouchi, as currently recognized, may contain more than one species. Because the application of the scientific name acouchy, currently in use for the Red Acouchi, has historically been disputed, the name Myoprocta acouchy has sometimes been used for this species instead of Myoprocta pratti. The species is named for Antwerp Edgar Pratt who was a British naturalist.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{consists}} of several parts which, while dealing with parasites of the agouti, are quite separate in themselves. A general historical account therefore, may be both disconnected and confusing. Wherever {{it is possible}} to do so, an account of previous work will be given before each undertaking. The family <b>Dasyproctidae</b> including about twenty three (23) species of agoutis and pacas is peculiar to the neotropical region. Two species of this family are found in Trinidad viz. Dasyorocta agouti and Coelogenys paca. The agouti, (Dasyprocta agouti) is found also in a few of the islands north of Trinidad but, {{with the possible exception of}} the one found in Tobago, the others were most likely introduced by man. On the mainland of South America, the agouti ranges from Mexico to Paraguay...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 30 animals {{of the genus}} Dasyprocta were cytogenetically studied. They belong to the {{following}} species: D. prymnolopha (N= 20), D. leporina (N= 6), D. fuliginosa (N= 1) and Dasyprocta sp. (N= 3) (<b>Dasyproctidae,</b> Hystricognathi). Cell suspensions were obtained by peripheral blood culture, besides bone marrow and spleen cells, from D. prymnolopha and D. leporina. The diploid number was 64 / 65 for all samples. The karyotypes showed similarity, and chromosomal polymorphism was not detected by Giemsa conventional staining and G banding. The constitutive heterochromatin distribution at the pericentromeric region of all the chromosomes was similar in all species. D. prymnolopha, D. leporina and Dasyprocta sp. presented variation in the heterochromatical block size {{at one of the}} homologues of the A 18 pair. D. fuliginosa presented the heterochromatin uniformly distributed in all chromosomes. There was not variation in the NORs pattern in the species studied...|$|E
40|$|Currently, two {{allopatric}} {{species of}} acouchies, genus Myoprocta (Rodentia: <b>Dasyproctidae)</b> are recognized. Nevertheless, there is morphological {{variability in the}} regions where the species are distributed that suggests either sympatry of two (or more) distinct species or else breakdowns in the characters {{that have been used}} to diagnose the species. We reviewed specimens of Myoprocta from Colombia and found that both reddish and greenish forms are sympatric in the Amazon basin of the country, including areas adjoining Ecuador and Peru. These records apparently refute the hypothesis of allopatry for these species in South America. However, the results of a principal components analysis showed little or no morphological separation between these two forms. In addition, a review of skulls throughout the geographic range of M. pratti shows high morphological variation. Although sympatry of reddish and greenish acouchies has been suggested for the Amazon region of Ecuador, our review found no evidence of this. In view of our findings, further revisionary work is needed to clarify the status of these forms...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a {{checklist}} of flying and non-flying mammal species which occur in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, delimiting species by vegetation domains and vulnerability. Records were based on specimens in museums, literature, and only eventually on photos (by camera traps). There are 151 mammal species reported or collected in the state, comprising 10 orders and 29 families. The richest orders were Chiroptera (61 spp.), Rodentia (35), Carnivora (18), and Didelphimorphia (16). The richest families were Phyllostomidae (33 species), Cricetidae (23), Didelphidae (16), Molossidae (13), Vespertilionidae (9), Felidae (7), and Dasypodidae (6). Cerrado was the richest domain (117 spp.) followed by Pantanal (110). According to the Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis (IBAMA) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 17 species are threatened; they are species of Felidae (n = 6), but also include Canidae (2), Didelphidae (2), Cervidae (1), Dasypodidae (1), <b>Dasyproctidae</b> (1), Mustelidae (1), Myrmecophagidae (1), Phyllostomidae (1), and Tapiridae (1) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{molecular}} phylogeny of the rodent superfamily Cavioidea was derived using two nuclear sequences (exon # 10 {{of the growth}} hormone receptor gene and intron # 1 of the transthyretin gene) and one mitochondrial gene (12 S rRNA). A combined analysis produced a highly derived and well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis that differed from traditional taxonomy primarily in the placement of two taxa. Kerodon, traditionally included within the subfamily Caviinae with guinea pigs and its relatives, is placed sister to the family Hydrochaeridae and closely aligned with the subfamily Dolichotinae. Inclusion of Hydrochaeris within the Caviidae renders the familial classification paraphyletic. Our data further support the taxonomic separation of the families Agoutidae and <b>Dasyproctidae.</b> Both the molecular and traditional morphological interpretations are assessed in testing an ecological constraints hypothesis regarding social behaviors. Whereas traditional taxonomy is consistent with an environmental constraints explanation for social behavior, the molecular data suggest that phylogenetic effects {{may be a more}} important factor in the evolution of social behavior in this group. Although lineage-specific rate heterogeneity was identified in all three molecular data sets, no significant support was obtained for the metabolic rate hypothesis. However, both nuclear genes displayed patterns in accordance with the generation time hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|Redescriptions {{are given}} of the mature oocysts of Eimeria aguti Carini 1935, E. cotiae Carini, 1935 and E. paraensis Carini, 1935, in the faeces of five {{specimens}} of the rodent Dasyprocta leporina (Rodentia: <b>Dasyproctidae)</b> {{from the state}} of Pará, North Brazil. New information is provided on the sporulation time of these parasites and the prepatent period in experimentally infected D. leporina. Some endogenous stages of E. cotiae are described in the epithelial cells of the ileum, and the absence of any oocysts in the gall-bladder contents of the infected animals indicates that the intestine is also the site of development of E. aguti and E. paraensis. Difficulties in separating E. cotiae and E. paraensis on morphology of the oocysts are discussed. The oocysts of both parasites share many structural features and have a wide size range. It is concluded that although it is at present best to maintain these names, the possibility exists that they were separately given to oocysts of smaller dimensions (E. cotiae) and larger dimensions (E. paraensis) of a single parasite. Location of an endogenous site of development for E. paraensis that is distinctly separate from that of E. cotiae might establish more definitely the separate specific status of the two parasites...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We updated the {{checklist}} of mammals from Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil based on primary records only. One hundred and sixty-six mammal species were listed as {{occurring in the}} state, 47 of them being medium to large, 47 small mammal and 73 bat species. The listed species are distributed in 31 families: Didelphidae (17 spp.), Dasypodidae (7 spp.), Myrmecophagidae (2 spp.), Cebidae (1 sp.), Callithrichidae (2 spp.), Aotidae (1 sp.), Pitheciidae (1 sp.), Atelidae (1 sp.), Leporidae (1 sp.), Felidae (7 spp.), Canidae (4 spp.), Mustelidae (5 spp.), Mephitidae (2 spp.), Procyonidae (2 spp.), Tapiridae (1 sp.), Tayassuidae (2 spp.), Cervidae (4 spp.), Sciuridae (1 sp.), Cricetidae (22 spp.), Erethizontidae (1 sp.), Caviidae (3 spp.), <b>Dasyproctidae</b> (1 sp.), Cuniculidae (1 sp.), Echimyidae (4 spp.), Phyllostomidae (41 spp.), Emballonuridae (2 spp.), Molossidae (16 spp.), Vespertilionidae (9 spp.), Mormoopidae (1 sp.), Noctilionidae (2 spp.), and Natalidade (1 sp.). These numbers represent an increase of fourteen species with primary records for the state {{in comparison with the}} previously published checklist. However, it is evident the scarcity of information at several regions of the state, and the need of implementation of regional zoological collections.

40|$|The red-rumped agouti is a small-sized wild rodent, {{belonging}} to the <b>Dasyproctidae</b> family, with great zootechnical potential, and it adapts well to captivity. In order {{to contribute to the}} species biology, this study describes the origin of the nerves forming the lumbosacral plexus. Twelve animals (six males and six females) were used, from previous experiments. The animals were fixed in a 10 % formaldehyde aqueous solution and eviscerated after 72 hours. Then, the major and minor psoas muscles were retracted, exposing the nerves forming the plexus. Cotton soaked with 20 -volume hydrogen peroxide was placed on these nerves, remaining for 12 hours straight for bleaching and subsequent dissection. The topographical relations of the lumbosacral plexus were grouped into tables and arranged in terms of simple percentage. In 7 cases (58. 34 %), the lumbosacral plexus in the red-rumped agouti stemmed from the ventral roots of the last 4 lumbar nerves and the first 3 sacral nerves (Type I – L 4 -S 3), in 4 animals (33. 33 %) it stemmed from L 5 -S 3 (Type II), and in 1 case (8. 33 %) it stemmed from L 5 -S 4 (Type III). The nerves participating of the lumbosacral plexus in the red-rumped agouti were: lateral femoral cutaneous, genitofemoral, femoral, obturator, sciatic, cranial gluteal, caudal gluteal, and pudendal nerve. The origin of the lumbosacral plexus and the spinal nerves making up this plexus in red-rumped agoutis were similar to that described in other rodents, such as rock cavy, lowland paca and spix's yellow-toothed cavy...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} flexibility, sutures are regions that {{experience}} greater strains than the surrounding rigid cranial bones. Cranial sutures {{differ in their}} degree of interdigitation or complexity. There is evidence indicating that a more convoluted suture better enables the absorption of high stresses coming from dynamic masticatory forces, and other functions. The Order Rodentia is an interesting clade to study this because of its taxa with diverse chewing modes. Due to repeated loading resulting from gnawing and grinding, energy absorption by the sutures might be a crucial factor in these mammals. Species within the infraorder Caviomorpha were chosen {{as a case study}} because of their ecomorphological and dietary diversity. This study compared five sutures from the rostrum and cranial vault across seven caviomorph families, and assessed their complexity by means of the relative length and fractal dimension. Across these rodents, cranial sutures are morphologically quite diverse. We found that the sutures connecting the rostrum with the vault were relatively more interdigitated than those in the cranial vault itself, especially premaxillofrontal sutures. Suture interdigitation was higher in species that display chisel-tooth digging and burrowing behaviors, especially in the families Ctenomyidae and Octodontidae, than those in families <b>Dasyproctidae</b> and Cuniculidae, which have more gracile masticatory systems. The reconstruction of the ancestral character state, on family and species phylogeny, points toward low suture interdigitation (i. e., low length ratio) as a likely ancestral state for interfrontal, premaxillofrontal and maxillofrontal sutures. Interspecific differences in suture morphology shown here might represent adaptations to different mechanical demands (i. e., soft vs. tough foods) or behaviors (e. g., chisel-tooth digging), which evolved in close association with the diverse environments occupied by caviomorph rodents...|$|E
40|$|Nicaragua’s Cosigüina Peninsula, {{located at}} the northwestern tip of the country, {{is one of the}} most poorly studied biotic regions in Central America. The {{peninsula}} has been occupied for millennia because the climate of the region supported human habitation and because of its strategic position along the rich Pacific coast. The combination of long-term occupancy by humans and the cataclysmic eruptions of Volcán Cosigüina have produced a heavily impacted landscape. During the 1960 s, the University of Kansas conducted multiyear field surveys of the terrestrial mammals on the peninsula and the adjacent mainland to quantify species diversity, relationships, abundances, habitat use, and reproduction. The mammalian fauna of the peninsula contains at least 39 species of terrestrial mammals, which includes 7 orders and 17 families. These include Didelphimorphia (2 species) — Didelphidae, 2; Chiroptera (22) —Emballonuridae, 2; Noctilionidae, 1; Mormoopidae, 1; Phyllostomidae, 12; Vespertilionidae, 3; Molossidae, 3; Carnivora (4) —Procyonidae, 1; Mustelidae, 1; Felidae, 2; Perissodactyla (1) —Tapiridae, 1; Artiodactyla (1) —Cervidae, 1; Rodentia (8) —Sciuridae, 1; Heteromyidae, 1; Muridae, 5; <b>Dasyproctidae,</b> 1; Lagomorpha (1) —Leporidae, 1. We provide new information on distributions, systematics, morphometrics, and natural history of the species of terrestrial mammals on the Cosigüina Peninsula, including a number of new records for the peninsula. We document that diversity and abundances of mammals can be substantial in a heavily impacted landscape. In comparison with five other mammalian faunas in Nicaragua, the Cosigüina fauna is most similar in size and diversity with those from elsewhere in the Pacific lowlands. The fauna from the Cordillera los Maribios, which is composed of the volcanic peaks along the eastern edge of the Pacific Lowlands, has the lowest number of species recorded for any of the six faunas with only 21 species recorded; however, this fauna may be under sampled or the unstable environments offered by these active volcanoes may not support a large or diverse mammalian fauna. The mammalian faunas from the remaining two physiographic regions of Nicaragua—Central Highlands and Atlantic Lowlands—have larger, more diverse faunas than that of the Cosigüina Peninsula and elsewhere in the Pacific lowlands. Three reserves in Nicaragua’s Sistema Nacional de Áreas Protegidas now protect more than one-fourth of the peninsula...|$|E

Analisou-se os métodos de pesquisa utilizados pela etnografia/etnologia, assim como, a documentação visual existente e as informações disponíveis -ou que podem ser friccionadas - nas interfaces: cultura/ambiente, e arte/ciência. Uma contribuição no presente trabalho consiste em uma revisão crítica dessas informações obtidas em trabalhos anteriores, através da ótica da inter-ação metodológica. Vislumbra-se o espaço dos museus a ser explorado; quando propõe aproxima-los das coleções que comporta com a gema de aspectos observáveis e relacionáveis, por intermédio dos meios audiovisuais.

Abstract: The work's {{goal is to}} investigate, using sonorized diapositives, informations {{related to}} an indicator, a referent from nature (the Edentata, the Perissodactyla, the Dasyoproctidae and the Cebidae), present in the material culture of the great Kayapó Indian nation. As {{a description of the}} project we are able to say that this investigation reflects the interest in the Indian codes for visual communication, and in the knowledge that these people have on the animal species wich compose the regional environment where they live. At the same time it reflects the preoccupation with the extinction of these species and of the Indians groups. The methods of research utilized by ethnography / ethnology were analysed as well as the existing visual documentation and the information available within culture / environment and art/science interfaces. One important part of the present work consists in a critical revision of the informations obtained in the previous analysis, in order to meet a methodological interaction. The museum has much to be explored, for this it must bring near the collections it contains, in search of a better profit, obtained from observable relating clues wich are to be supplied the very resources available...|$|E
40|$|The Yucatán Peninsula, as {{encompassed}} in {{this series}} of papers, includes the Mexican states of Campeche and Yucatán, and the Federal Territory of Quintana Roo. This region is a low-lying plain that rises gently in elevation {{from north to south}}. It is surrounded on three sides by water and bounded on the south by British Honduras (i. e. Belize), Guatemala, and the Mexican state of Tabasco. The vegetation of the peninsula increases in height from north to south and from the coast inland. Generally, forest to the north is xerophilic, but that of {{the southern part of the}} peninsula is tall, quasi rainforest. Although the mammalian fauna of the Yucatán Peninsula is unique in many ways, there has been no comprehensive account of mammals of the region since Gaumer 2 ̆ 7 s (1917) 2 ̆ 2 Monografía de los mamíferos de Yucatán. 2 ̆ 2 In an earlier paper of this series (Jones, et al., 1973), the chiropteran fauna of the peninsular region was treated. The present report deals exclusively with rodents, 20 native species of which (and two that have been introduced) presently are known from the Yucatán Peninsula. These 22 species represent 16 genera of seven families as follows: Sciuridae, two; Geomyidae, one; Heteromyidae, two; Cricetidae, 12; Muridae, two (introduced); <b>Dasyproctidae,</b> two; and Erethizontidae, one. One genus (Otonyctomys) is endemic to the peninsula, as are four species (Sciurus yucatanicus, Heteromys gaumeri, Peromyscus yucatanicus, and Reithrodontomys spectabilisi and a number of subspecies. This report is based principally upon material housed in the Museum of Natural History at the University of Kansas. In the summer of 1962, two field parties from Kansas visited the region, one consisting of W. E. Duellman and six students enrolled in a field course in vertebrate zoology, and the other including the senior author and four students working on a survey of terrestrial vertebrates and their ectoparasites under the aegis of a contract (DA- 49 - 193 MD- 2215) from the U. S. Army Research and Development Command. Also, Percy L. Clifton, field representative of the Museum of Natural History, collected mammals on the peninsula from mid-December 1962 until June 1963. Collections from which specimens were examined are: Museum of Natural History at The University of Kansas, the American Museum of Natural History, the British Museum (Natural History), the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, the Museum, Texas Tech University, and the National Museum of Natural History. Most localities mentioned in text are plotted in a map. Ectoparasites obtained from our material from the Yucatán Peninsula have been reported by Emerson (1971), Genoways (1973), Lawlor (1965, 1969), Loomis (1969), and Price and Emerson (1971) ...|$|E
