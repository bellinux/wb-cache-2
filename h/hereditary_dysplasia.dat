We used blood samples for genetic analysis. Results: Although {{there is a clear}} clinical picture of the dysplasia, the radiological signs are more reliable for making the diagnosis.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Hereditary</b> {{collagen}} <b>dysplasias</b> {{comprise a}} complex group of connective-tissue disorders {{that result in}} the reduced tensile strength of affected tissues. These processes are called cutaneous asthenia in the skin of dogs and cats. We report here {{the case of a}} crossbred male cat, aged 6 months, that presented with two skin wounds in the region of the right thorax and right iliac tuberosity. The skin of these regions and of the animal’s dorsum was hyperextensible, smooth to the touch, and easily torn with minor trauma. Microscopic examination of skin samples revealed reduced dermal connective tissue consisting of shortened and fragmented collagen fibers. Normal fibers were intermingled with altered fibers. Ultrastructural changes in collagen fibers included disorientation of fibrils within the same bundle, marked spacing differences, and variation in the diameter of transverse sections. The fibrils maintained the transverse striations characteristic of normal collagen...|$|R
5|$|OCD {{occurs in}} 15 to 30 people per 100,000 {{in the general}} {{population}} each year. Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active adolescents. Because their bones are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents {{can be attributed to the}} bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. Franz König coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an inflammation of the bone–cartilage interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, osteonecrosis, accessory ossification center, osteochondrosis, and <b>hereditary</b> epiphyseal <b>dysplasia.</b> Some authors have used the terms osteochondrosis dissecans and osteochondral fragments as synonyms for OCD.|$|R
40|$|Matrilin- 3 {{belongs to}} the matrilin family of {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) proteins and is primarily expressed in cartilage. Mutations in the gene encoding human matrilin- 3 (MATN- 3) lead to autosomal dominant skeletal disorders, such as multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), which is characterized by short stature and early-onset osteoarthritis, and bilateral <b>hereditary</b> microepiphyseal <b>dysplasia,</b> a variant form of MED characterized by pain in the hip and knee joints. To assess the function of matrilin- 3 during skeletal development, we have generated Matn- 3 null mice. Homozygous mutant mice appear normal, are fertile, and show no obvious skeletal malformations. Histological and ultrastructural analyses reveal endochondral bone formation indistinguishable from that of wild-type animals. Northern blot, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analyses indicated no compensatory upregulation of any other member of the matrilin family. Altogether, our findings suggest functional redundancy among matrilins and demonstrate that the phenotypes of MED disorders are not caused {{by the absence of}} matrilin- 3 in cartilage ECM...|$|R
