5|$|During a Friday night performance, Tony is drunk as {{he comes}} {{backstage}} during the interim between his part in Acts IV and V. Felicity is angry that Tony, a recovering alcoholic, got drunk again; she has had to issue several refunds because of his drunken behaviour on stage. She sends him into the shower to sober up, and summons Jim. He is unsure whether he knows the lines well <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> onstage in Tony's place, but Laura encourages {{him to take the}} chance. As she hands him a prop dagger, he sees blood all over the dagger and her hands. Tony comes out of the shower and wants to finish the performance, so Jim allows him to go. Laura berates Jim for his lack of ambition. She is left alone in the dressing room and hears noises coming from the shower; but when she goes to look, it is empty. A scream is then heard from the stage.|$|E
5|$|On lap 21, Rosberg made a {{pit stop}} for the {{intermediate}} tyres, leaving only Ricciardo and Hamilton {{at the front of}} the field on the full wet tyres. Ricciardo made the switch on lap 24, but Hamilton stayed out, opting to remain on the wet tyre until the track dried out <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> straight to slicks. In the meantime, Verstappen had fought his way back into the top ten, after having started 21st. In the subsequent laps, Ricciardo was able to reduce the gap to Hamilton in the lead, edging as close as half a second by lap 28. Behind the leading pair, Rosberg was third ahead of Pérez and Vettel. The pivotal moment of the race followed on lap 31, when Hamilton changed to slick tyres. When Ricciardo followed suit a lap later, his pit crew were not ready for him and had the wrong tyres, resulting in a long stop, handing the lead to Hamilton, who stayed narrowly ahead of him. Sergio Pérez was another driver who benefited during the second round of stops, emerging in third. Rosberg was left in sixth after both Vettel and Alonso also came out ahead of him after the switch to dry tyres. On lap 34, Ricciardo made an attempt to repass Hamilton on track, but Hamilton successfully defended his position.|$|E

25|$|Exodus says {{each day}} one omer of manna was {{gathered}} per family member (about 3.64 litres), and may imply this was {{regardless of how}} much effort was put into gathering it; a midrash attributed to Rabbi Tanhuma remarks that although some were diligent <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the fields to gather manna, others just lay down lazily and caught it with their outstretched hands. The Talmud states that this factor was used to solve disputes about the ownership of slaves, since the number of omers of manna each household could gather would indicate {{how many people were}} legitimately part of the household; the omers of manna for stolen slaves could be gathered only by legitimate owners, and therefore legitimate owners would have spare omers of manna.|$|E
25|$|Steve Marriott {{was born}} on 30 January 1947 at East Ham Memorial Hospital, Plashet, East Ham, (London, E7), England to parents Kay and Bill Marriott who lived at Strone Road, Manor Park. Born three weeks {{premature}} and weighing just , he developed jaundice and was kept in hospital four weeks before being well <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> home. Marriott came from a working-class background and attended Monega Junior School. His father Bill worked as a printer and later owned a jellied eels stall, called 'Bill's Eels', outside the Ruskin Arms hotel. For a short time he also sold pie and mash. Kay worked at the Tate & Lyle factory in Silvertown. Bill was an accomplished pub pianist and the life and soul of many an 'East End' night. Bill bought Marriott a ukulele and harmonica which Marriott taught himself to play. Marriott showed an early interest in singing and performing, busking at local bus-stops for extra pocket money and winning talent contests during the family's annual holiday to Jaywick Holiday camp near Clacton-on-Sea.|$|E
25|$|Radulovics' final {{major event}} was the European Championship in 2004, as she retired from {{international}} handball after the tournament. Although she dreamed about winning {{the gold medal}} in front of home crowd, Radulovics had to be content herself with a bronze after Hungary lost to Norway in the semifinals and beat Russia in the third place match. The Hungarian team set off with a three match winning run, with that they easily won their preliminary group. Radulovics played in terrific form, especially against Austria, hitting the back of the net 13 times. During the main round phase Hungary continued to play top quality handball, but suffered a one-goal defeat against Denmark, which cost them the top spot of the group and as a result, they had to face prime title candidates and eventually winners Norway in the semifinal. Radulovics scored ten goals against the Hammerseng-led Scandinavians, but it was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the finals, since {{the rest of the team}} slightly underperformed and Hungary suffered a heavy loss (29–44).|$|E

25|$|After the Pacification of Ghent {{the entire}} Habsburg Netherlands had risen against Philip II of Spain. When the new Governor-General, Philip's {{half-brother}} Don Juan, {{arrived in the}} country in November, 1576, he initially feigned readiness to cooperate with the States-General, but soon there was a rupture, and the war was resumed. From January, 1578 on, the reinforcements that were sent to Don Juan by way of the Spanish Road had made him strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on the offensive. Almost immediately, he gained a stunning victory in the Battle of Gembloux. This motivated foreign powers to intervene on behalf of the States-General. Queen Elizabeth of England sent money and troops, as did the Duke of Anjou. These reinforcements formed the backbone of a reconstituted States Army that took up formation in a reinforced encampment at Rijmenam during July, 1578. The nominal commander of this force was the Count of Boussu. It consisted mainly of English mercenaries under Sir John Norris and Sir Richard Bingham, Scottish mercenaries under Robert Stuart, and French Huguenots under François de la Noue. On the eve of the battle it was waiting for further reinforcements from the Count Palatine, who was waiting near Zutphen for the arrival of a subsidy that Queen Elizabeth had promised, but not yet paid. Without those considerable reinforcements it counted about 18,000-foot and 2,000 horse.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as a Rifle Platoon Commander of Company H, Third Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 27 October 1952. With his platoon subjected to an intense mortar and artillery bombardment while preparing to assault a vitally important hill position on the main line of resistance which had been overrun by a numerically superior enemy force on the preceding night, Second Lieutenant O'Brien leaped from his trench when the attack signal was given and, shouting for his men to follow raced across an exposed saddle and up the enemy-held hill through a virtual hail of deadly small-arms, artillery and weapon fire. Although shot through the arm and thrown to the ground by hostile automatic-weapons fire as he neared the well-entrenched enemy position, he bravely regained his feet, waved his men onward and continued to spearhead the assault, pausing only long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the aid of a wounded Marine. Encountering the enemy at close range, he proceeded to hurl hand grenades into the bunkers and, utilizing his carbine to best advantage in savage hand-to-hand combat, succeeded in killing at least three of the enemy. Struck down by the concussion of grenades on three occasions during the subsequent action, he steadfastly refused to be evacuated for medical treatment and continued to lead his platoon in the assault for a period of nearly four hours, repeatedly encouraging his men and maintaining superb direction of the unit. With the attack halted, he set up a defense with his remaining forces to prepare for a counterattack, personally checking each position, attending to the wounded and expediting their evacuation. When a relief of the position was effected by another unit, he remained to cover the withdrawal and to assure that no wounded were left behind. By his exceptionally daring and forceful leadership in the face of overwhelming odds, Second Lieutenant O'Brien served as a constant source of inspiration to all who observed him and was greatly instrumental in the recapture of a strategic position on the main line of resistance. His indomitable determination and valiant fighting spirit reflect the highest credit upon himself and enhance the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E

It just feels different, and I think it demonstrates that Nintendo is reluctant to sail into the murky waters beyond Wind Waker." [...] The American newspaper The New York Times enjoyed Phantom Hourglass for the most part, but complained about the timer in the Temple of the Ocean King as unnecessary and gimmicky, remarking that the game's dungeons are only [...] "fun to go through once, but none of them are fun <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through 20 times".

500|$|After Reading went {{four games}} without a win {{starting}} on 24 January 1976, a late goal from Friday ended this run on 25 February, {{in a home}} match against Hartlepool United; twelve minutes from time, he collected a pass from Stewart Henderson and neatly placed the ball past the goalkeeper {{from the edge of}} the penalty area.
