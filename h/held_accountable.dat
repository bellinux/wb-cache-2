5|$|Because of {{the sudden}} large {{increase}} in the number of reported deaths in Hunan in a matter of hours, Chinese government officials accused local officials of covering up damage and casualty details. The Ministry of Civil Affairs sent a team to Hunan to investigate the allegations, and issued a notice stating that anyone found to be covering up any damage details would be <b>held</b> <b>accountable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 610 Office's {{intelligence}} collection efforts are bolstered through he cultivation of paid civilian informants. 610 Offices at local levels {{have been found}} to offer substantial monetary rewards for information leading to the capture of Falun Gong practitioners, and 24-hour hotlines have been created for civilians to report on Falun Gong-related activity. In some locales, 'responsibility measures' are enacted whereby workplaces, schools, neighborhood committees and families are <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> for monitoring and reporting on Falun Gong practitioners within their ranks.|$|E
5|$|Focused on hockey, {{exposed to}} drugs and alcohol and {{frequently}} getting into fights, James {{paid little attention to}} her education and nearly dropped out of school. A vice-principal at Valley Park Middle School, Ross Dixon, encouraged her to pay greater attention to her studies, allowing her to graduate from Overlea High School, now named Marc Garneau Collegiate Institute, and move onto Seneca College in Toronto. James struggled academically in her first year at Seneca, partially because she had rarely been <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> for failing in her studies in the past, and partly because she was playing two sports at both the college and community level while working part-time jobs to help pay the family's bills. Seneca's hockey coach Lee Trempe had several arguments with James before she began to take her studies seriously.|$|E

5|$|Prime Minister Harper's apology {{excluded}} Newfoundland and Labrador as it {{was argued}} {{that the government should}} not be <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> for pre-Confederation actions. Residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador were located in St. Anthony, Cartwright, North West River, Nain and Makkovik. These schools were run by the International Grenfell Association and the German Monrovian Missionaries. The government argued that because these schools were not created {{under the auspices of the}} Indian Act, they were not true residential schools. More than 1000 survivors disagreed and filed a class action lawsuit against the government for compensation in 2007. By the time the suit was settled in 2016, almost a decade later, dozens of plaintiffs had died. It was expected that up to 900 former students would be compensated.|$|E
5|$|Some Weiquan {{lawyers have}} {{advocated}} {{for the rights}} of HIV/AIDS victims who contracted the virus as a result of state-sponsored blood drives. In the 1990s, government officials in central China, and especially in Henan, encouraged rural citizens to sell blood plasma in order to supplement their incomes. Gross mismanagement of the process resulted in hundreds of thousands of individuals being infected with HIV. According to activists, victims have not been compensated, and no government officials were <b>held</b> <b>accountable.</b> Authorities continue to suppress information about the epidemic, which is particularly sensitive in light of the involvement of Li Changchun, the Communist Party Propaganda head and formerly Party chief in Henan.|$|E
5|$|The show {{planned a}} {{dramatic}} stunt which {{would lead to}} the discovery of Callum's body. The scene featured Carla Connor (Alison King) causing a car accident, colliding with Tyrone Dobbs' (Alan Halsall) pick-up truck which smashes into the Platt's home. This causes the floor to give way and a recovery team unearthing Callum's body. Producers decided to conclude the story without Kylie being <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> for the murder. Instead they used a character that had been recently killed off, Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard), who had publicly feuded with Callum. When Sarah confesses the truth to Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley), he decides to frame Tony for the crime–a scheme which proved successful.|$|E

5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and the jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not be <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> for her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, but the jury did not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. She concluded that she saw the murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Kronan {{was a hard}} {{blow for}} Sweden during the Scanian War. Besides being {{the largest and most}} heavily armed ship in the Swedish Navy, she had been an {{important}} status symbol for the monarchy of the young Charles XI. Along with Kronan, the navy lost a sizeable proportion of its best manpower, acting supreme commander Lorentz Creutz, numerous high-ranking fleet officers, and the chief of the navy medical staff. A commission was set up to investigate whether any individuals could be held responsible for the Swedish fiasco at the Battle of Öland and other major defeats during the war. Although no one was officially <b>held</b> <b>accountable,</b> Creutz has been blamed by many historians for the sinking of Kronan because of his naval and command inexperience. Recent research has provided a more nuanced picture, and points to Sweden's general lack of a well-developed naval organization and officer corps at the time.|$|E
5|$|With the {{accession}} of ElizabethI in November 1558, Robert Dudley {{came into}} great favour and was made Master of the Horse. Ambrose Dudley received {{the post of}} Master of the Ordnance, though he pressed his influential brother to delay the appointment somewhat, {{so that he could}} not be <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> for his predecessor's embezzlement of funds. When their attainder had been lifted in 1558, the Dudley brothers had renounced any rights to their father's possessions or titles. Yet on 25 and 26December 1561 Ambrose Dudley was created Baron Lisle and Earl of Warwick, and the next year received {{a large portion of the}} lands confiscated from the Duke of Northumberland. Warwick Castlewhich the Queen visited on her 1572 summer progressbecame his seat, while the neighbouring Kenilworth Castle became that of Robert Dudley. Like their father, Ambrose and Robert Dudley adopted the bear and ragged staff, the heraldic device of the medieval Earls of Warwick.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{external and internal}} accountability of foreign ESL teachers in China through a comparison with Chinese local ESL teachers. A cross-sectional survey design was used. Two research questions were developed from a literature review to examine foreign ESL teachers' perceptions toward external accountability and internal accountability. Questionnaires from forty-five ESL teachers and eighty-one Chinese local ESL teachers were collected through an on-line survey. Data of teachers' perceptions towards four constructs: external accountability (outside expectations), external accountability (school management), internal accountability (professional duty), and internal accountability (feelings about work), were analyzed. The findings showed that foreign teachers perceived that they were <b>held</b> externally <b>accountable</b> with regard to outside expectations, {{and they were not}} <b>held</b> externally <b>accountable</b> for school management. In terms of internal accountability, foreign teachers perceived that they <b>held</b> themselves highly <b>accountable</b> in both the construct of professional duty and the construct of feelings about work...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates why {{entrepreneurs}} experience stigma after firm {{failure and}} what can be done to reduce it. We use attribution theory as an overarching theoretical framework and hypothesize that entrepreneurs are <b>held</b> more <b>accountable</b> than employees for their unemployment after firm failure irrespective of the circumstances causing the failure. To test this hypothesis we conduct a between group, 2 x 2 full factorial experiment where the cause of the failure is manipulated. We find that entrepreneurs are <b>held</b> more <b>accountable</b> for firm failure irrespective of the circumstances causing the failure and that respondents who view failure as an inherent risk of firm ownership are less likely to stigmatize failed entrepreneurs...|$|R
