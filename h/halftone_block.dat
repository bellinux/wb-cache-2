40|$|Cluster dot {{dithering}} is {{very useful}} halftoning for multifunction printers with electrophotographic printing process. However, {{there is an}} inevitable trade-off between spatial resolution and grey tone levels: sharpness and smoothness. In addition, it tends to produce undesired artifacts when printed images such as newspapers and magazines are copied. In this paper, we propose efficient, locally-content adaptive, and clustered dot halftoning, which improves image sharpness, increases text readability, suppresses artifacts, and maintain smoothness in scanned images from printed documents or natural images. We first split an image into 5 x 5 pixel blocks, and then each block is processed in raster scan order. Each pixel in the current processed block is classify into one of three categories {{by the process of}} non-smooth detection and halftone extraction. The disconnected characteristic of halftones is then used to separate halftone pixels from edge pixels. An adaptive approach to generate halftone images is used in each different type of block. Edge-enhanced cluster dot dithering is applied to edge blocks to reproduce sharp edges and also minimize block artifacts. The scaled and weighted factors are then used to determine the number and the position of black dots in the current processing block. To get the proper weighting and scaling values, we use average lightness and minimum square error from dithered images of several step inputs. Unlike edge block, preprocessing is performed before halftoning in halftone and complex blocks to recover the original continuous image from a halftone image. For <b>halftone</b> <b>block,</b> we estimate halftone resolution from the gradients at halftone pixels by three pairs one-dimensional derivative masks with different size, and then apply the average filter, which is chosen by the estimate of halftone resolution, to each pixel. For complex block, we group all pixels by virtual edge lines and then compute the average value of pixels in each group. The virtual edge lines are determined by edge direction and edge pixels along the edge direction, and these edge lines are used to separate a complex block into two or more groups which have different grey values in the original continuous-tone image. We use only one screen in an entire image to minimize block artifacts that appear when switching between different approaches at boundaries of different types of blocks. The proposed method is suitable for hardware implementation because it requires a small amount of memory and simple operations. Our experiments show that text readability and edge sharpness are enhanced while image smoothness are reproduced. ...|$|E

50|$|Frederic E. Ives {{is usually}} {{credited}} with the first commercially successful process that was compatible with ordinary letterpress printing, so that <b>halftone</b> <b>blocks</b> could be printed along with blocks of text in books, periodicals and newspapers. His process came into widespread use during the 1890s, largely replacing the hand-engraved wood and metal blocks that had previously served to provide illustrations.|$|R

Albert Reed specialised {{in the production of}} paper suitable for <b>halftone</b> <b>blocks</b> for which there was considerable demand at the time and by 1903 he owned seven mills. Under his leadership the business expanded rapidly securing an order to supply newsprint for the Daily Mirror in 1904. Reed was importing paper from a mill in Canada by 1911.|$|R

Ray and Sons was {{primarily}} {{set up as}} an initiative to remedy the lack of good quality printing of illustrations in Calcutta {{in spite of the}} existence of advanced printing presses in the early 1890s. Upendrakishore, a versatile genius, excelling in the fields of children’s literature, music, painting and printing technology could not therefore have first grade illustrations published for his Children’s Ramayan. A lack of skill in graphic arts and photo-processes resulted in ruined print illustrations. ‘At that time, only a few local firms like Thacker and Spincks (of Thacker's Indian Directory) took commercial orders for <b>halftone</b> <b>blocks</b> but they were very costly. Being of an inventive and mechanical turn of mind, Upendrakishore ordered the necessary equipment from A.W. Penrose & Co., of 109 Farringdon Street, London, and began to study the technical nature of the subject. These studies led him to investigate the theoretical basis of the process camera and arrive at conclusions which standardises the hitherto empirical practices at process work.’ [...] ‘A camera and various pieces of half-tone equipment arrived from Britain … bybullock cart; soon after that, they moved out of 13 Cornwallis Street to a house not far away which Upendrakisore had made into a studio. The money for this came from selling most of his share in the zamindari at his ancestral home in Mymensingh to his foster brother Narendrakisore, {{who was in charge of}} it following his father Harikisore’s death,’ records Andrew Robinson ...|$|R
40|$|A {{particularly}} effective method for analyzing document images, that consist {{of large numbers}} of bi-nary pixels, is to generate reduced images whose pixels represent enhancements of textural densities in the full-resolution image. These reduced images are generated using an integrated combination of filter-ing and subsampling. Previously reported methods used thresholding over a square grid, and cascaded these threshold reduction operations. Here, the approach is generalized to a sequence of arbitrary filter-ing/subsample operations, with emphasis on several particular filtering operations that respond to salient textural qualities of document images, such as <b>halftones,</b> lines or <b>blocks</b> of text, and horizontal or vertical rules. As with threshold reductions, these generalized “textured reductions ” are performed with no regard for connected components. Consequently, the results are typically robust to noise processes that can vitiate analysis based on connected components. Examples of image analysis and segmentation operations using textured reductions are given. Some properties can be determined very quickly; for example, the existence or absence of halftone regions in a full page image can be established in about 10 milliseconds...|$|R
