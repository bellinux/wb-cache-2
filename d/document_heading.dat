40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the prevalence of catecholamine excess and phaeochromocytomas in a well-defined population of people with hereditary head and neck paragangliomas. We studied in a prospective follow-up protocol all consecutive patients referred to the Department of Endocrinology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands with <b>documented</b> <b>head</b> and neck paragangliomas and either a positive family history for paragangliomas or a proven SDHD gene mutation. Initial analysis included medical history, physical examination and the measurement of excretion of catecholamines in two 24 -h urine collections. In the case of documented catecholamine excess iodinated meta-iodobenzylguanidine (123 I-MIBG) scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging were done. Between 1988 and 2003, 40 consecutive patients (20 male and 20 female) with <b>documented</b> <b>head</b> and neck paragangliomas were screened. Biochemical screening revealed urinary catecholamine excess in 15 patients (37. 5 %). In nine of these 15 patients a lesion was found by 123 I-MIBG scintigraphy. Exact localization by magnetic resonance imaging revealed phaeochromocytomas in seven of the 15 patients. One of the nine patients had an extra-adrenal paraganglioma. Histopathological examination in a subset of tumors displayed loss of heterozygosity of the wild-type SDHD allele in all cases. The prevalence of catecholamine excess (37. 5 %) and phaeochromocytomas (20. 0 %) is high in patients with familial head and neck paragangliomas. Therefore, patients with hereditary head and neck paragangliomas require lifelong follow up by biochemical testing for catecholamine exces...|$|R

500|$|At {{some point}} during his illness Edward wrote a draft <b>document</b> <b>headed</b> [...] "My devise for the Succession". Due to his ardent Protestantism Edward did not want his Catholic sister Mary to succeed, {{but he was also}} preoccupied with male {{succession}} and with legitimacy, which in Mary's and Elizabeth's case was questionable as a result of Henry VIII's legislation. In the first version of his [...] "devise", written before he knew he was mortally ill, Edward bypassed his half-sisters and provided for the succession of male heirs only. Around the end of May or early June Edward's condition worsened dramatically and he corrected his draft such that Lady Jane Grey herself, not just her putative sons, could inherit the Crown. To what extent Edward's document—especially this last change—was influenced by Northumberland, his confidant John Gates, or still other members of the Privy Chamber like Edward's tutor John Cheke or Secretary William Petre, is unclear.|$|R

The panel found that Christie’s conduct was dishonourable, and that in his zeal to pursue the case on behalf of his clients, Christie had overlooked his professional responsibilities.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a formal}} and iconographic {{study of a}} distinctive engraved motif found on Cupisnique style vessels that were excavated {{in what is now}} northern Peru. The Cupisnique style was developed approximately between 1200 – 200 B. C. E., and was mainly centered in the Jequetepeque and the Chicama Valleys in the northern coastal region of Peru. This study includes an analysis of two ceramic vessels {{in the collection of the}} Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (henceforth VMFA). The purpose of this dissertation is to document and analyze the Cupisnique engraved head motifs and to argue that these motifs reflect the influence of early Formative Ecuador ceramics on the later coastal Cupisnique as well as on the highland Chavín style. In addition to the two VMFA vessels, this study documents and analyzes an additional one hundred seventy seven (177) Cupisnique ceramics vessels that were also engraved with head motifs. These belong to various museums and private collections in South and North America. This study also presents a catalog of all <b>documented</b> <b>head</b> motifs, including those captured on photographs and in original drawings. The Cupisnique head motifs are classified by individual elements, and iconographies of Cupisnique head motifs are presented based on the origin and influence of the motifs...|$|R

Charlemagne, however, in his quality of [...] "Patricius", wanted to be considered as the highest court of appeal in criminal cases in the States of the Church.

This {{is followed by a}} hand-written list of fifty-two men, mostly in alphabetical order. Some of these men have letters after their names - W or M or P or RIP. The letters RIP are well known - Rest in Peace - but less obvious might be W for ‘wounded’, M for ‘missing’ and P for ‘prisoner of war’. The other <b>document,</b> <b>headed</b> by an image of the Crucifixion in a military cemetery, begins ‘From this parish the following gave their lives for King and Country during the war 1914 to …’. Then there are 4 hand-written names, followed by the date on which they died.Hand-written and clearly maintained {{over the course of the}} war, these historic documents are a record of the commitment and ultimate sacrifice of local men at a time of national emergency. They also bear witness to the strength and solidarity of the women on the home front who prayed as a community for the safe return of their husbands, sons and brothers. However we now know that the list of the dead was incomplete, one man, listed on the Roll of Honour as 'wounded and missing', had in fact been killed in action.|$|R
