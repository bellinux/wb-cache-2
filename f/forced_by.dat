40|$|Although {{airborne}} mineral aerosols {{are traditionally}} considered a natural {{component of the}} earth-atmosphere climate system, an examination of dust production mechanisms and dust source regions reveals that a significant fraction of the dust loading {{could be due to}} human activities. We find that the global mean direct solar radiative <b>forcing</b> <b>by</b> anthropogenically generated mineral aerosols may be comparable to the direct solar radiative <b>forcing</b> <b>by</b> other anthropogenic aerosols. The net regional <b>forcing</b> <b>by</b> mineral aerosols can greatly exceed the regional <b>forcing</b> <b>by</b> sulfate aerosol and can even be comparable to the net <b>forcing</b> <b>by</b> clouds. An improved understanding of the radiative forcing due to mineral aerosols requires better knowledge of the regional patterns of dust production rates and dust optical depths, more comprehensive measurements of dust microphysical and optical characteristics, as well as a comprehensive assessment of the role of dust aerosols on infrared radiative forcing...|$|R

5|$|Danzig was saved, but {{the next}} year the {{strengthened}} in the Ducal Prussia Swedish army took Brodnica, and early in 1629 defeated the Polish units at Górzno. Gustavus Adolphus from his Baltic coast position laid an economic siege against the Commonwealth and ravaged what he had conquered. At this point allied forces under Albrecht von Wallenstein were brought in {{to help keep the}} Swedes in check. <b>Forced</b> <b>by</b> the combined Polish-Austrian action Gustavus had to withdraw from Kwidzyn to Malbork, in process being defeated and almost taken prisoner by Koniecpolski at the Battle of Trzciana.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the ACC {{experienced}} {{a season of}} unusual parity and fielded an NCAA-record number of ten bowl-eligible teams. Six of those possessed identical 4–4 conference records, and the remaining four had 5–3 conference records. Among the eligible teams, N.C. State (6–6) possessed the only non-winning overall record and was therefore <b>forced</b> <b>by</b> NCAA rules to find an at-large berth outside of the ACC tie-in games.|$|E

Although Latino Review was later asked to remove their review, numerous other websites and blogs published their own critiques of the script.|$|E

5|$|In September 1989 the Navy {{announced}} that it had determined that Hartwig intentionally caused the explosion. The victim's family members, many in the media, and the United States Congress rejected the Navy's findings. Sandia National Laboratories, acting on a request from the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, determined that the explosion {{could have been an}} accident caused by overramming the powder bags into the gun's breech during the loading process. <b>Forced</b> <b>by</b> the revelation to reopen its investigation, the Navy inexplicably, according to Thompson, placed Miceli in charge of the new inquiry.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to terraforming, optimizing individual base performance and building secret projects, players may also benefit their factions through social engineering, probe teams, and diplomacy. Social engineering modifies the ideologically based bonuses and penalties <b>forced</b> <b>by</b> the player's choice of faction. Probe teams can sabotage and steal information, units, technology, and energy from enemy bases, while diplomacy lets the player create coalitions with other factions. It also allows the trade or transfer of units, bases, technology and energy. The Planetary Council, {{similar to the}} United Nations Security Council, takes Planet-wide actions and determines population victories.|$|E
