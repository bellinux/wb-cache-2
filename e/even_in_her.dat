5|$|Although {{women were}} on a lower social tier than men (according to Confucian ethics), they enjoyed many social and legal {{privileges}} and wielded considerable power {{at home and in}} their own small businesses. As Song society became more and more prosperous and parents on the bride's side of the family provided larger dowries for her marriage, women naturally gained many new legal rights in ownership of property. Under certain circumstances, an unmarried daughter without brothers, or a surviving mother without sons, could inherit one-half of her father's share of undivided family property. There were many notable and well-educated women, and it was a common practice for women to educate their sons during their earliest youth. The mother of the scientist, general, diplomat, and statesman Shen Kuo taught him essentials of military strategy. There were also exceptional women writers and poets, such as Li Qingzhao (1084–1151), who became famous <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lifetime.|$|E
5|$|In {{later life}} she {{converted}} to Buddhism and remained single thereafter, largely {{retiring from the}} world. <b>Even</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> eighties, however, she was still active in the literary world, entertaining female artists such as Huang Yuanjie and Yi Lin at her home on the West Lake {{after the collapse of}} the Ming Dynasty. With her Buddhist friend Yang Jiangzi (the sister of Xue's fellow courtesan Liu Yin), she made pilgrimages to sacred sites such as Mount Lu and Mount Emei. The date of her death is uncertain; some sources suggest that she may have lived into the 1650s whilst others put her death in the late 1630s or early 1640s. Qian Qianyi mentions her death in a work published in 1652, so it is evident that she must have died before this date.|$|E

She was influenced by her family and her older brother Dan and was later approached by her school's coach, Julie Grim, who later became her mentor, and who convinced her to play the game. She played for the North Tartan AAU team that won nationals and earned the Sporting News Top Student Athletes in the Country among other awards.|$|E

25|$|Saint Cloud, {{where she}} was less watched and {{confined}} than in Paris (where her jailers followed her every step, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> bedroom). Mirabeau retained a close connection with the queen, and drew up many state papers for her. In return, the king used money from Austria to pay his debts secretly {{and give him a}} monthly subsidy of six thousand francs, with promises of a million or more. Some historians argue Mirabeau was not the traitor that many believed him to be because he continued to uphold his political beliefs and tried to make possible a bridge between the king and the revolutionaries.|$|E
25|$|On 6 October 1789, {{the royal}} family was forced by a Parisian mob mostly {{composed}} of women to move from Versailles to the Tuileries Palace in Paris, where they spent {{the next three years}} as prisoners under the daily surveillance of the national guards who did not spare any humiliation to {{the royal family}}; at that time Marie Antoinette was always surrounded by guards, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> bedroom at night and these guards were present when the Queen was allowed to see her children. The family lived a secluded life, and Marie Antoinette dedicated most of her time to her two children under the daily surveillance of the national guards who kept her hands behind her back and searched everybody from the Queen to the children to see if any letters were smuggled to the royal prisoner. On 21 June 1791, the family tried to escape in {{what is known as the}} Flight to Varennes, but the attempt failed. After the family was recognized, they were brought back to Paris. When the Tuileries Palace was stormed by an armed mob on 10 August 1792, the royal family sought refuge at the Legislative Assembly.|$|E

[...] "She's almost too good: It's not until she's left {{a scene that}} you realize the movie isn't working."

500|$|Historians {{agree with}} the suspicions of her Household that the Munshi {{influenced}} the Queen's opinions on Indian issues, biasing her against Hindus and favouring Muslims.

500|$|Minnie began {{painting}} in late 1999 or 2000, {{when she was}} almost 80. When asked why she had not begun earlier (painting and batik works had been created at Utopia for over 20years), her daughter Barbara Weir reported Minnie's answer as being that [...] "no-one had asked her". By the 2000s, she was reported as living at Alparra, the largest of Utopia's communities, or at Urultja (also Irrultja, again in the Sandover region). Sprightly and outgoing, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> eighties she could outrun younger women chasing goannas for bushfood, and she continued to create art works until two days before her death on 18 March 2006. She was outlived by all her sisters except Maggie Pwerle, mother of artists Gloria and Kathleen Petyarre (or Pitjara).|$|E
500|$|Bush's musical {{aesthetic}} is eclectic, and {{is known}} to employ varied influences and meld disparate styles, often within a single song or {{over the course of}} an album. <b>Even</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> earliest works, with piano the primary instrument, she wove together many diverse influences, drawing on classical music, glam rock, and a wide range of ethnic and folk sources. This would continue throughout her career. By the time of Never for Ever, Bush had begun to make prominent use of the Fairlight CMI synthesizer, which allowed her to sample and manipulate sounds, expanding her sonic palette. She has been compared with other [...] "'arty' 1970s and '80s British pop rock artists" [...] such as Roxy Music and Peter Gabriel. The Guardian called Bush [...] "the queen of art-pop." ...|$|E

The Royal Navy were fully aware that the ship's protection flaws still remained, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> revised design, so Hood was intended for the duties of a battlecruiser and she served in the battlecruiser squadrons through most of her career. Late in her career, Hood was outclassed by the armour and protective arrangement of World War II-era fast battleships, but few available [...] "big gun" [...] vessels could match Bismarcks speed, and in 1941 the Admiralty included Hood among the ships sent to engage the German battleship.|$|E

500|$|Tradition names {{her mother}} as Cleïs, though ancient {{scholars}} may simply have guessed this name, assuming that Sappho's daughter Cleïs {{was named after}} her. [...] Sappho's father's name is less certain. [...] Ten names are known for Sappho's father from the ancient testimonia; this proliferation of possible names suggests {{that he was not}} explicitly named in any of Sappho's poetry. [...] The earliest and most commonly attested name for Sappho's father is Scamandronymus. [...] In Ovid's Heroides, Sappho's father died when she was seven. [...] Sappho's father is not mentioned in any of her surviving works, but Campbell suggests that this detail may have been based on a now-lost poem. Sappho's own name is found in numerous variant spellings, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> own Aeolian dialect; the form that appears in her own extant poetry is Psappho.|$|E
500|$|By the 1830s, the Sherwoods {{had become}} more prosperous and the family decided {{to travel to the}} continent. The texts that Sherwood wrote {{following}} this trip reflect her exposure to French culture in particular. She also embarked on a large and complex Old Testament project at this time, for which she learned Hebrew. To assist her, her husband assembled, over the course of ten years, a large Hebrew-English concordance. Unfortunately, Sherwood's autobiography provides scant details regarding the last forty-odd years of her life. [...] However, we do know that <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> seventies, Sherwood wrote for four or five hours a day; many of these books were co-authored with Sherwood's daughter, Sophia. [...] According to M. Nancy Cutt, a Sherwood scholar, this joint authorship led to a [...] "watery sentimentality" [...] not evident in Sherwood's earlier works as well as a greater emphasis on issues of class.|$|E
500|$|In Sherrybaby, Gyllenhaal {{played a}} young drug-addicted thief {{trying to put}} her life in order after prison so she can {{reconcile}} with her daughter. During promotion of the film, she noted of her portrayal of the character: [...] "I think she's in such dire straights [...] that all she has are these kind of naive, fierce hope. And while I was playing the part I was looking for pleasure and hope in everything, even in these really bleak things. And {{so it was really}} mostly after I finished the movie that I felt pain." [...] Her performance in the film was well received: David Germain of the Associated Press wrote, [...] "Gyllenhaal humanizes her so deeply and richly... that Sherry elicits sympathy <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> darkest and weakest moments", and Dennis Harvey of Variety called her performance [...] "naturalistic". For her work, Gyllenhaal earned her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and won the Best Actress category award at the 2006 Stockholm International Film Festival.|$|E

[...] Because she does not pursue a romantic interest in Batman, [...] "Batgirl is a female Batman can actually regard as a brilliant peer and a partner in the war on crime, the same way he would a male." [...] Historian Peter Sanderson observed that while [...] "Barbara Gordon initially conformed to hackneyed stereotypes as a dowdy librarian... her transformation into Batgirl could be seen in retrospect {{as a symbol of the}} emerging female empowerment movement of the 1960s.

[...] In response to a question asking if the magic presented in the Harry Potter series should be considered in the same light as some New Age practices warned against in the document, Fleetwood stated, [...] "If I have understood well the intentions of Harry Potter's author, they help children to see the difference between good and evil.
