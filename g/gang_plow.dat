Since the land west of Utah Lake lacks any major streams, they built a pumphouse at the lake's edge, dug irrigation ditches, and installed a series of pumps to water the farmland. A large boarding house was constructed to house up to 250 workers. In 1911 the boarding house filled with workmen from surrounding towns, recruited to clear and plow the land and plant apple and peach seedlings. A steam tractor pulling a massive <b>gang</b> <b>plow</b> was used {{to break up the}} soil.|$|E
5000|$|Two American brothers, Thaddeus and Jerome Harper, {{traveled}} from Harpers Ferry, Virginia, via California, to British Columbia in the Cariboo Gold Rush. They mined in Yale, {{and lived in}} Victoria for a time. At one point, they were accused of supporting the rebel Confederacy and plotting against the nearby North. One account suggests that {{they were asked to}} leave the border area of British Columbia. Some miners worked their way up the Fraser River seeking gold and found the remote plateau. Unsuccessful in their search for gold, the Harpers settled on {{the west bank of the}} Fraser River in 1863 and installed a <b>gang</b> <b>plow.</b> Thus the Gang Ranch began its long operation.|$|E
40|$|The {{guide to}} the “Cornhusker State” is full of many {{interesting}} photographs {{of the people and}} places of Nebraska. They portray a largely agrarian state of hard-working farmers. There is an interesting essay on the unicameral legislature of Nebraska. The guide sticks pretty close to the series format. Eight cities are given detailed descriptions. There are 13 detailed tours of the state. SOME of us in Nebraska {{know what it is to}} have made the first wagon track across an unbroken sea of grass into a new land, with no guide but the sun, the distant hilltops, and our own resolution. I remember more than one such road. We had to find our way, discover our own fords, devise our own gully crossings, and leave a trail which others could follow and improve. This book is another road starter. It is the first attempt to put into one compact handy volume the story of Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s land and its people and a guide to every part of the State. It is the first Nebraska Baedeker. Its preparation has called into the Federal service more than one hundred writers, researchers, draftsmen, and photographers, for a period exceeding two years. In the course of their work they have handled thousands of books, newspapers, and manuscripts, and have traveled Nebraska from the black prairie soil along the Missouri to the pine tree ridges beyond the sandhills. The Superintendent and staff of the Nebraska State Historical Society have had the privilege of assisting in an advisory and critical capacity. Contents FOREWORD, By Addison E.

40|$|<b>Gang</b> <b>plowing</b> is {{one method}} {{used by the}} Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) to {{increase}} the productivity of snowplow operations. However, these gains in productivity often {{come at the expense}} of increased driver stress. These higher stress levels are the result of the low visibility caused by localized snow clouds created by the lead snowplow, and by anxious drivers trying to pass between the moving plows. To improve the <b>gang</b> <b>plowing</b> process, a DGPS-based <b>gang</b> <b>plowing</b> system has been developed. This system uses advanced technology to allow a trailing snowplow to automatically follow a lead snowplow at an operator-specified lateral and longitudinal offset. The system is designed to improve both safety and productivity. This report covers three areas. First, to improve driver visibility, an implementation of the virtual mirror to the left side of the trailing plow is described. Second, the lateral and longitudinal performance of a two-vehicle gang on Minnesota Trunk Highway 101 is described. Third, a system architecture for gangs of more than two vehicles is proposed, and its potential performance is documented through simulation. Finally, recommendations for further research and other potential applications are provided. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|R

[...] "I'm doing what I can to achieve it, sir," [...] he said. [...] "In fact, I'm staking somewhat heavily.

5000|$|The Avery {{company made}} many {{traction}} engines, {{such as the}} 1907 steam tractor model. At that time steam was the only form {{of power and the}} tractor resembled a miniature locomotive. In 1909, Avery began manufacturing gasoline tractors. They shortly gained a reputation for producing huge tractors, including the very large for its day [...] Avery steam traction engines, weighing 25 ST each. Large tractors were needed across the prairie from North Dakota to Texas to turn the virgin sod, often with roots as thick as a man's thumb, into tillable soil. Even teams of 16 horses were not strong enough to pull <b>gang</b> <b>plows</b> through the dense bunch grasses whose roots grew as deep as 6 ft into the earth. The first small steam traction engines, adapted from the design of stationary engines used to thresh wheat and gin cotton, weren’t strong enough and broke down repeatedly.|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} driver assistive {{system which}} utilizes dual frequency, carrier phase real time kinematic (RTK) differential {{global positioning system}} (DGPS), high accuracy digital geospatial databases, advanced automotive radar, and a driver interface with visual, haptic, and audible components has been used to assist specialty vehicle operators perform their tasks under these low visibility conditions. The system is able to provide a driver with high fidelity representations of the local geospatial landscape through a custom designed Head Up Display (HUD). Lane boundaries, turn lanes, intersections, mailboxes, and other elements of the geospatial landscape, including those sensed by automotive radar, are projected onto the HUD in the proper perspective. This allows a driver to safely guide his or her vehicle in low to zero visibility conditions in a desired lane while avoiding collisions. Four areas of research, are described herein: driver assistive displays, the integration of a geospatial database for improved radar processing, snowplow dynamics for slippery conditions, and a virtual bumper based collision avoidance/gang <b>plowing</b> system. (<b>Gang</b> <b>plowing</b> is the “flying in formation ” of snowplows as a means to rapidly clear multilane roads.) Results from this research have vastly improved the performance and reliability of the driver assistive system...|$|R
50|$|According to {{an article}} in the 1 January 1890 issue of the Los Angeles Times, the Baker works then {{occupied}} some 25,000 sq ft and provided employment to 75 men. A large variety of manufacturing was being done. The foundry was making iron and brass castings to fit nearly all kinds of machinery for mining and milling purposes, besides pumping plants for large and small water-works, and steam plants for all the variety of uses to which steam was put. They manufactured their own boilers. They were also manufacturing oil-boring tools and rigs, and constructing elevators—both passenger and freight—in all varieties: hydraulic steam or hand. It was claimed by the newspaper that Baker had installed nearly all the first class passenger elevators in Southern California. The article said they manufacture street-cars and did other railroad work to order and claimed to make the best <b>gang</b> <b>plows</b> and road and field rollers that could be obtained anywhere. They also installed heating and ventilating plants for public buildings, both steam, hot water and hot air. And they did architectural iron-work. Milo S. Baker was then President, J.E. Sills was Vice-President and Treasurer, and Fred L. Baker (Milo’s son) was Secretary and Plant Superintendent.|$|R

25|$|Slavery is {{more common}} when the labour done is {{relatively}} simple and thus easy to supervise, such as large-scale growing of a single crop. It {{is much more difficult}} and costly to check that slaves are doing their best and with good quality when they are doing complex tasks. Therefore, slavery was seen as the most efficient method of production for large-scale crops like sugar and cotton, whose output was based on economies of scale. This enabled a gang system of labour to be prominent on large plantations where field hands were monitored and worked with factory-like precision. Each work gang was based on an internal division of labour that not only assigned every member of the gang to a precise task but simultaneously made their own performance dependent on the actions of the others. The hoe hands chopped out the weeds that surrounded the cotton plants as well as excessive sprouts. The <b>plow</b> <b>gangs</b> followed behind, stirring the soil near the rows of cotton plants and tossing it back around the plants. Thus, the gang system worked like an early version of the assembly line later to be found in factories.|$|R
