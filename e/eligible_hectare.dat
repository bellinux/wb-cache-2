40|$|The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union (EU) was {{established}} to maintain balance between farming industries and the environment {{as well as to}} provide economic sustainability in rural areas. EU Regulations for agricultural and rural development, adopted by countries upon their admission to the EU, allow payments to farmers for each <b>eligible</b> <b>hectare</b> of agricultural land (CAP reform), under different payment schemes. Remote sensing data is currently used as an efficient tool in determining areas potentially eligible for payments, through land cover identification and mapping. Launched in August 2008, RapidEye consists of five constellation multispectral sensors with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 6. 5 m and a daily overpass. The satellite has a predicted lifespan of 7 years and with the target application of the sensor being agriculture; contains a high potential for the application of agricultural monitoring, necessary to some new Member States, such as Bulgaria and Romania. Analysis of RapidEye imagery, combined with local ancillary data over pre-selected test zones lead to determination and classification of land cover features which have potential or no potential to be eligible under the Single Area Payment Scheme (SAPS). This classification was completed using object oriented analysis and was run concurrently alongside a pixel based (self-organizing maps) analysis for comparison. JRC. DG.

50|$|The Verderers and Commoners' Defence Association {{has fought}} back. The Single Payment Scheme helped some Commoners significantly. Those that put animals out and could claim <b>eligible</b> <b>hectares</b> could claim up to £850 for each cow per year, and £900 {{for a pair}} of ponies. If they also {{registered}} for the stewardship scheme, they could make more. So with just 10 cattle and 40 ponies, a Commoner who qualified for both these schemes could make over £30,000 a year and more if they put out pigs: well over the national average earnings. They were also helped to access other EU funds for farming equipment. Planning permission has also now been relaxed for Commoners.|$|R
40|$|This report {{analyses}} {{the use of}} IACS {{and other}} datasets for reporting and accounting Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and removals in the land use sector. The land use sector comprises land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) as well as agriculture, jointly referred to as agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU). Decision 529 / 2013 /EU of the European Council and the Parliament of 21 May 2013 brings the LULUCF sector in the EU emission accounting obligations. These new accounting obligations for EU member states are phased in over a period extending to 2022. This Report, as part of work performed by the JRC for DG Climate Action under an Administrative Arrangement (AA), aims at exploring the usefulness for cropland management (CM) and grazing land management (GM) accounting of the vast amount of data already regularly collected on the EU level {{in the context of}} environmental and agricultural policies. One of the most promising datasets to meet LULUCF reporting obligations is the “Integrated Administration and Control System” (IACS) that has been set up by all member states to manage the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy, and its GIS, “the Land Parcel Identification System” (LPIS). The data the LPIS holds are geo-referenced polygons of land parcels (units of management or production), and information on the type of land cover, as a minimum in terms of broad categories such as arable land, grassland, permanent crops, and broad families of crops, with their area (<b>eligible</b> <b>hectares).</b> The LPIS is a pan-EU database that provides very detailed and accurate information on the status of agricultural land cover at any given time since 2005. The potential of the LPIS to efficiently track land use changes is derived from its pan-European semantic definition of agricultural land cover types, and the mandatory adequate update cycle of the dataset. This study assessed other potential datasets, including Eurostat “Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey” (LUCAS); the Farm Structure Surveys (FSS); the Farm Accountancy Data Network; CORINE Land Cover.

40|$|A major {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse the evolutionary patterns of regional linkages and disparities across the EU space, especially those related to rural and peripheral/remote regions. In particular, this report assesses the economy-wide effects, in terms of GDP and employment, induced, at the European level, by the 2007 - 2011 CAP payments and by the possible future scenarios concerning the next programming period (2014 - 2020). A multiregional closed I-O approach applied at a NUTS- 3 level is adopted. Particular attention focuses on the (re-) distributive effects produced by spatial and sectoral relationships. In defining regional policy, the knowledge of spillover effects is particularly strategic in that it can assist policy makers in better calibrating allocation of funds among regions and evaluating distribution of final policy effects more correctly. With reference to the next programming period, three main scenarios are analysed. Two are based on different and extreme shares of funds apportioned to basic payments. They are in turn divided into sub-scenarios based on three different criteria of regional distribution of funds devoted to basic payments: utilized agricultural area, agricultural value added and historical payments. A third scenario assumes the suppression of the actual framework based on two pillars and the transfer of all available funds to rural development policy. Results indicate that intersectoral and interregional linkages, which characterise the EU economic space, redirect a large part of effects, for any policy framework and scenario considered, from rural regions and from primary and secondary sectors (representing the main targets of policy) to urban and tertiary sectors, respectively. Moreover, they reveal that the best option for MSs in allocating basic payments among regions would be a criterion based on <b>eligible</b> <b>hectares,</b> which is the general principle on which the new CAP is based, since it would produce higher and more balanced distribution of effects among all regions. They also suggest that a total rethinking of the CAP by introducing only a single co-financed policy would lead to higher contribution to reduction in differences between rural and urban regions. Finally, the analysis shows that the policy decision taken for the 2014 - 2020 programming period to redistribute funds in favour of poorer regions not only is fair from an equity point of view but can also produce economic advantages for the regions directly penalised by a fund reallocation...|$|R
