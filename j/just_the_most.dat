5|$|Under the Plantagenets, England was transformed, {{although}} {{this was only}} partly intentional. The Plantagenet kings were often forced to negotiate compromises such as Magna Carta. These constrained royal power in return for financial and military support. The king was no longer <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> powerful man in the nation, holding the prerogative of judgement, feudal tribute and warfare. He now had defined duties to the realm, underpinned by a sophisticated justice system. A distinct national identity was shaped by conflict with the French, Scots, Welsh and Irish, {{and the establishment of}} English as the primary language.|$|E
5|$|While the Potomac River forts {{were being}} built, {{planning}} and surveying was ordered for an enormous new ring of forts {{to protect the}} city. Unlike the fortifications under construction, the new forts would defend the city in all directions, not <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> direct route through Arlington. In mid-July, this work was interrupted by the First Battle of Bull Run. As the Army of Northeastern Virginia marched south to Manassas, the soldiers previously assigned to construction duties marched instead to battle. In {{the days that followed}} the Union defeat at Bull Run, panicked efforts were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack. The makeshift trenches and earthworks that resulted were largely confined to Arlington and the direct approaches to Washington.|$|E

25|$|Years {{after the}} war, {{memories}} faded {{and in the}} public mind it became popular to assume that the few pillboxes and other concrete objects that could easily be seen were all that was done to defend Britain; that their purpose was just to bolster morale and that {{there would have been no}} realistic hope of resisting a German assault. Even the Home Guard came to be seen as something of a joke, as exemplified by the BBC sitcom Dad's Army. However, what can be seen today are <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> visible and robust remains of a massive programme of fortification undertaken in a very short period.|$|E

500|$|The {{granting}} of armorial bearings (coat of arms) within the United Kingdom {{is the sole}} prerogative of the British monarch. However, the monarch has delegated this power to two authorities; the Lord Lyon, with jurisdiction over Scotland and the College of Arms over England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Under the latter's jurisdiction, the right to arms is acquired exclusively either by proving descent in an unbroken male-line from someone registered as so entitled or by a new grant from the King of Arms. These {{are the most common}} way of gaining this right, however technically arms can also be gained: {{by a grant from the}} Crown, by prescription (meaning in use since time immemorial), by succeeding to an office or by marriage. The descent of arms follow strongly the Law of heraldic arms, which is a branch of English law, interpreted by civil lawyers in the Court of Chivalry. Sir Edward Coke in his Commentary upon Littleton (1628) wrote that [...] "gentry and armes is the nature of gavelkinde, for they descend to all the sonnes." [...] Arms in England, therefore descend to all of the male lines, and not <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> senior alone (unlike in Scotland).|$|E

It basically said don't talk to your girlfriend about it when you're at home in bed." [...] The Mail on Sunday wrote of Russell [...] " [...] has a mind like a steel trap and the organisational skills of Winston Churchill." [...] Reflecting in 1999, Greengrass admitted: [...] "In retrospect {{a lot of the}} things we did were ridiculous. We sit in [...] meetings today and we're like 'It's on the Internet.

500|$|Before the Clash began {{recording}} {{their second}} album, CBS requested that they adopt a cleaner sound {{than its predecessor}} {{in order to reach}} American audiences. Sandy Pearlman, known for his work with Blue Öyster Cult, was hired to produce the record. Simonon later recalled, [...] "ecording that album was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> boring situation ever. It was just so nitpicking, such a contrast to the first album... it ruined any spontaneity." [...] Strummer agreed that [...] "it wasn't our easiest session." [...] Although some listeners complained about its relatively mainstream production style, Give 'Em Enough Rope received largely positive reviews upon its November release. It hit number 2 in the UK, but it was not the American breakthrough CBS had hoped for, reaching only number 128 on the Billboard chart. The album's first UK single, the hard rocking [...] "Tommy Gun", rose to number 19, the highest chart position for a Clash single to date. In support of the album, the band toured the UK supported by the Slits and the Innocents. The series of concerts—there were more than thirty, from Edinburgh to Portsmouth—was promoted as the Sort It Out Tour. The band subsequently undertook its first, largely successful tour of North America in February 1979.|$|E

[...] He also confirmed Jamie King as the tour director and Brian Friedman as the choreographer. The following month, Friedman {{announced that he had}} pulled out of the tour due to scheduling conflicts with his own reality series. In a video interview posted on Spears's official website, she said, [...] "The Femme Fatale Tour will hopefully just be outrageously spectacular.

This {{is one of the most}} excited I've been about a project in a really long time, so I can't wait." [...] The script of the show was created by Jamie King, and was inspired by the concept of the femme fatale and femme fatales throughout the ages. Rudolph stated that the idea for the show was to have Spears as an [...] "international woman of mystery". The setlist was composed mostly of songs from Femme Fatale, but also included hits from her previous albums, as Spears explained, [...] "The fans really like a lot of the old songs, because that's what they are used to. So it's just about finding the balance, and how many songs I wanna incorporate from the past and from the present." ...|$|E
500|$|Paige {{transferred}} to the New York production of Sunset Boulevard to make her Broadway debut at the Minskoff Theatre on 12 September 1996, staying with the show until it closed on 22 March 1997. On the Sunset Boulevard set in Broadway, the staircase steps had to be raised six inches (15cm) {{in order to accommodate}} Paige's short stature, or it would have been hard to see her behind the banister. [...] Paige was welcomed to the Broadway stage with a long standing ovation from the audience, and received largely positive reviews for her New York performance as Norma Desmond: [...] "The lush sound and the sheer power of her voice are, to put it simply, incredible", wrote one critic, whilst another said [...] "Her voice has great range, remarkable clarity and emotional force". Paige was the first Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard to sing one of the show's key songs, [...] "With One Look", which she did first at Lloyd Webber's wedding to Madeleine Gurdon, although at the time the song was called [...] "Just One Glance". Lloyd Webber noted, regarding Paige's performance of one of the show's other prominent songs, [...] "As If We Never Said Goodbye", that it was [...] "as good, if not the best, of anything I've ever heard of mine". [...] Regarding the key lyric in the song, [...] "This world's waited long enough. I've come home at last", Paige had sought to change the way the melody was sung, despite being fully aware of Lloyd-Webber's fastidious tendencies. To her, the moment was not exploited to its fullest potential, so she approached the show's musical director, David Caddick, and expressed her wish to hold the word [...] "home", to which he agreed. Although she had been disappointed when she hoped to perform on Broadway in Evita, Cats and Chess, Paige stated of her debut there, [...] "It was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> perfect time to go with that particular show". After Sunset Boulevard finished, she suffered from depression, commenting that the show's closing [...] "was the most terrible feeling.... I'd felt I'd lost something so very important to me.
