40|$|The {{interplay between}} geology and biology has shaped the Earth during billions of years. Microbe-mineral {{interactions}} are prime {{examples of this}} interplay and underscore the importance of microorganisms in making Earth a suitable environment for all forms of life. The present thesis takes an interdisciplinary approach to obtain an integrated understanding of microbe-mineral interactions. More specifically it addresses how the composition and distribution of biogenic weathering agents (siderophores) differ with regard to soil horizon and mineral type in situ, what siderophore type soil microorganisms produces under laboratory conditions, what role microbial surface attachment plays in mineral weathering reactions and what central roles and applications siderophores have in the environment. Podzol, the third most abundant soil in Europe, and most abundant in Scandinavia, was chosen for a field experiment, where three minerals (apatite, biotite and oligoclase) were inserted in the organic, eluvial and upper <b>illuvial</b> <b>soil</b> horizons. The study started with {{an investigation of the}} siderophore composition in the bulk soil profile and on the mineral surfaces (paper I), which was followed by a study of the siderophore producing capabilities of microorganisms isolated from the soil profile under laboratory conditions (paper II). Subsequently, a study was done on the impact of microbial surface attachment on biotite dissolution (paper III). Finally, the roles of siderophores in nature and their potential applications were reviewed (paper IV). The major findings were that the concentration of hydroxamate siderophores in the soil attached to the mineral surfaces was greater than those in the surrounding bulk soil, indicating that the minerals stimulate the microbial communities attached to their surfaces to produce more siderophores than the microorganisms in the bulk soil. Each mineral had a unique assemblage of hydroxamate siderophores, that makes the mineral type one of the main factors affecting siderophore composition in the natural environment. Siderophore production varied between the microbial species originating from different soil horizons, suggesting that the metabolic properties of microbes in deep soil horizons function differently from those at upper soil horizons. Microbial surface attachment enhanced the biotite dissolution, showing that attached microbes has a greater influence on weathering reactions in soil than planktonic populations. In conclusion, our findings reflected that the complicated relationship between microorganisms and mineral surfaces reinforces the central theme of biogeochemistry that the mineral controls the biological activity in the natural environments. However, the importance of these relationships to the biogeochemical systems requires further investigation. At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 2 : In press. Paper 3 : In press.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Potato is an {{extremely}} valuable food species, as well as fodder crop and industrial plant. Potato is ranked among the primary world crops, due to its great ecological plasticity, falling after wheat, rice and maize, while the highest productions can be obtained in temperate areas. The Huedin micro-area is geographically situated in the Huedin depression, on the Transylvanian side of the Apuseni Mountains, at a 550 - 700 altitude. The geomorphological characterization includes dimly-inclined mounds to hills of different expositions. It accounts for a surface of over 8000 ha, out of which homogenous ecologic territories favourable for potato cultivation of over 40 bonitation points cover a surface of 1710 ha. The average ponderate grade of micro-area bonitation is 52 points and accounts for an average soil production potential of 26 tons potato tubers/ha. From a pedological point of view, the brown soils area, respectively luvisol, brown clay <b>illuvial</b> <b>soils,</b> namely the preluvisol and pseudorendsines, namely the calcareous Phaeozem. The paper aims at describing the main soil types, typical preluvisol, namely the brown clay illuvial one and the typical Luvisol, respectively the brown lluvial soil, which are favourable for potato cultivation in the Huedin micro-area, both for seeding potato and consumption...|$|R
5000|$|Loess {{deposits}} {{with lime}} nodules {{are found in}} the <b>illuvial</b> horizons of <b>soils</b> that formed on loess and loess-like loams. In the soil profile, the nodules stand out as bright spots with a clear and rounded shape. The size of spots is 1-2 cm in diameter, which is comparable to the size of an eye, and, more specifically, to that of the species of birds known as White-eye. Thus, the name [...] "White-eye" [...] for loess with lime nodules may have been derived from their comparison to these birds. Unlike other forms of carbonate nodules, which are often found in more solid rock, loess deposits with lime nodules are soft and crumbly, or loose. The German word for loose is Loess; it was first used in about 1821 in reference to the Rhine River loess.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the study of the process of {{vertical}} migration of phosphogypsum components according to the soil profile. The qualitative and quantitative identification of main biogenic elements (phosphorus, sulphur, calcium etc) and heavy metals in lysimetric solutions from various horizons while getting on the surface of soil solutions containing phosphogypsum components is carried out by means of designed laboratory and experimental complex. The mineral hard soil fraction is also analysed. According to the results of the X-ray diffractometrical researches, the carbonates with heavy metals in their structure, caused by the ion-exchange with Са 2 +, were found in the mineral structure of the <b>illuvial</b> horizon <b>soil</b> samples. The results of experimental modeling indicate significant changes in the chemical parameters of groundwater, which are obtained by passing water with phosphogypsum particles on a model soil profile, which makes it easy to track the input data. In {{the upper part of the}} profile after 1 000 hours and for the first speed of the infiltration process, the constant moisture level was 25, 6 %, after the second speed of infiltration, it rose to 29. 1 %. Noted that the highest concentration of biogenic elements (calcium, sulfur, potassium) was found in lysimetric solutions obtained from the humus and eluvial horizons. In addition, it is determined that iron is present up to 5 %, nickel – within the range of 1 – 3 %, and copper – up to 1 %. It should be noted that the biochemical transformations of silicon influence the fractional distribution of heavy metals, which can be fixed by sorption-sedimentation mechanisms in silica, oligo and polysilicon compounds, as well as in crystalline lattice structures of clay minerals, quartz, etc. The model of soil and geochemical situation was formed according to the soil profile under the influence of the phosphogypsum within the three-dimensional surface, developed with the help of the stochastic reconstructions based on the images of the scan electron microscopes...|$|R
40|$|The sombric {{horizon is}} a {{diagnostic}} subsurface horizon {{defined in the}} soil classification system of the United States (Soil Taxonomy) and FAO (WRB), used to classify the soil at different categorical levels. The sombric horizon has a soil color darker than the overlying surface(s) horizon(s), and must show illuvial humus accumulation features, though they are not associated with aluminum (Al), as in the spodic horizon, nor associated with sodium (Na), as in the natric horizon. There are also criteria to distinguish it from buried A horizons. However, since the first references and proposed concept of the sombric horizon in African soils made by Sys and co-workers in the 1960 s, and adopted by the Soil Taxonomy edition of 1975, few modifications {{have been made to}} its definition. Moreover, the pedogenic process involved in illuvial humus accumulation in these horizons remains inadequately clarified, making the distinction between the sombric and spodic or buried A horizon difficult and unclear. This review reports the historical evolution of the sombric horizon concept, its definition and inconsistencies under different soil classification systems, and the current hypothesis, together with its fragilities, proposed to explain the <b>soil</b> <b>illuvial</b> humus accumulation. Although it is recognized that further research is necessary, alternative criteria are proposed for the definition of the sombric horizon in the Brazilian System of Soil Classification...|$|R
40|$|Silica {{cemented}} pedogenic horizons {{known as}} duripans occur on relict landforms in climates having limited leaching potential. Under {{the influence of}} tephra, incipient silica cementation may also occur in late Quaternary soils. The source of silica for cementation in Holocene soils is rapidly weatherable volcanic glass. In response to wetting and drying cycles volcanic glass weathers to form sand-size composite particles composed of silt, clay and redeposited silica. A portion of the hydrolyzed silica is eluviated as monosilicic acid which accumulates as the wetting front evaporates. Illuvial silica augments existing composite particles eventually forming a continuously cemented duripan. In actively forming late Quaternary soils, the cementation process is a complex interaction between illuvial silica, clay and calcium carbonate and the soil matrix. Surface reactions between monosilicic acid and <b>illuvial</b> clay or <b>soil</b> matrix particles provide nucleation sites for polymerization of silica concentrated by evaporation. The resulting opaline silica bonds adjacent soil grains without necessarily plugging intervening pore spaces. In contrast, calcium carbonate preferentially precipitates in large pores and interped voids. Cementation occurs by the plugging of progressively smaller pores with relatively pure calcite rather than by heterogeneous bonding of mineral grains. In illuvial zones containing both silica and calcium carbonate, cementation may occur rapidly because the former holds small soil particles in place while the latter plugs large pores. The mineralogy of silica cement is determined by identification of varying amounts of crystal order using X-ray diffraction. Opal-A is recently polymerized, noncrystalline, highly hydrated silica gel. The more prevalent, partly crystalline opal-CT forms where surface reaction with clays create crystal orientation, where silica gel dehydrates or when silica precipitates from soil solutions having high concentrations...|$|R
