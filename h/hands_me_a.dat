6000|$|Worst of all, {{she listened}} {{to what he said}} in the night. Corp had a habit of talking in his sleep. He was usually taking tickets at such times, and it had been her custom to stop him violently; but now she changed her tactics: she {{encouraged}} him. [...] "I would be lying in my bed," [...] he said to Tommy, [...] "dreaming that a man had fallen into the Slugs, and instead o' trying to save him I cried out, 'Tickets there, all tickets ready,' and first he <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> glove and neist he <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> boot and havers o' that kind sich as onybody dreams. But in the middle o' my dream it comes ower me that I had better waken up to see what Gavinia's doing, and I open my een, and there she is, sitting up, hearkening avidly to my every word, and putting sly questions to me about the glove." ...|$|E

They would be too delighted to light on the spirits and bacca to think of digging up the floor underneath. There they lie, till I take them down to the Marden. They put them into the eel tank, and next morning off she sails." ...|$|E

[...] Poe protested this assignment, {{reflecting}} in a column in 1980: [...] "I am stunned. I am indignant. Law is my love. I know nothing about writing...With considerable disinclination I take up my new duties." [...] McCeney's intention as that Poe operate the paper while studying for the bar exam.|$|E
5000|$|She {{moved on}} to Yale, where she earned an M.S. in Physics, and later became the first African-American woman in history to earn a Ph.D in astronomy. In 2015, Isler gave a talk on {{intersectionality}} in STEM industries and education, noting that:"...according to Dr. Jamie Alexander's archive of African-American women in physics, only 18 black women in the United States had ever earned a Ph.D. in a physics-related discipline, and that {{the first black woman}} to graduate with a Ph.D. in an astronomy-related field did so just one year before my birth." [...] She was often the only African-American in her classes, and endured years of backhanded comments. In an NPR interview, Isler recalled an exchange with her classmates during her first year at Yale."So there are plates everywhere," [...] she recalls. Everyone seemed full and content. [...] "And all of a sudden, this kid in my class <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> pile of his dirty plates" [...] — the student is a white male — [...] "he just kind of hands them to me and says, 'Here, now go and do what you're really here to do.'"In 2014, Isler published her doctoral dissertation, In Like a Lamb, Out Like a Lion: Probing the Disk-Jet Connection in Fermi Gamma-Ray Bright Blazars, which earned the Roger Doxsey Dissertation Prize from the American Astronomical Society.|$|E
5000|$|After James Curley {{sold the}} paper to G. Bowie McCeney, McCeney served as editor for six months before {{appointing}} Gertrude Poe editor in 1939. Poe had previously worked in McCeneys office and had recently graduated from American Universitys law school when she was hired as the Leaders editor rather than joining McCeneys firm as an attorney. [...] "He McCeney <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> copy the Leader with a grin and says, My career as an editor just ended. Yours is just beginning." [...] Poe served as the Leaders editor until 1980, while McCeney remained the papers publisher until 1978. In 1946 the papers name was changed to The News Leader, after merging with the Bowie Register and The College Park News, two other papers owned by McCeney. From 1939 until the late 1950s, the Leader was a [...] "one woman show," [...] with Poe serving as advertising salesperson, graphic designer, copywriter, proofreader, and distributor as well as editor. Under Poes leadership {{the focus of the}} paper shifted from national to local news, and increasingly catered to the local military population based at nearby Fort Meade. In addition, the paper made a strong effort to focus on positive news in the city. In 1992 Poe was quoted in an interview stating: [...] "Maybe I was a little lopsided...I still think the media in general focuses too much on the bad news...There are so many good people. That exposure in the paper means so much to them and their stories can inspire others." ...|$|E

5000|$|Although Aimless Love was Prine's first release not to chart, it {{received}} positive reviews upon release and remains highly regarded. In 1985, Don Shewey of Rolling Stone magazine wrote that Aimless Love showed that [...] "John Prine, the elegant pop songwriter, {{is still in}} top form." [...] Writing for Allmusic, critic William Ruhlman wrote of the album [...] "On this label debut, he is under no commercial pressures, but that seems to make him more low-key, less striking... his new sweetness, which is as winning as, if less impressive than, his witty older songs." [...] Prine biographer Eddie Huffman called Prine's vocals [...] "the best of his career to date" [...] and lauded the song [...] "Unwed Fathers" [...] as possibly [...] "the best since his debut, a character song that held its own with 'Sam Stone'..." [...] "Prine fan Bob Dylan held Prine's [...] "People Puttin' People Down" [...] in such high regard that he covered the song in concert, with Prine explaining in the Great Days anthology: [...] "I {{came out to the}} parking lot after the show, and there was the usual crowd. This mailman walked up to me and whispers, 'You want to hear a tape of Bob Dylan doing one of your songs?' I said, 'Sure!' He <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> tape from Rome, Italy, with Dylan doing about 30 Dylan songs and 'People Puttin' People Down'. Great version too. Incredible. So I saw Dylan last year and told him about this tape. And he goes, 'Where did you get it? Where'd you get it?' I told him a mailman gave it to me. I'm sure he believed that." ...|$|E

My nurse confirms my fear, saying, “Dr. Willson, the next available appointment with the pediatric gastroenterologist will be in 10 weeks. ” My nurse then <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> copy of the consen-sus guidelines on diagnosing and managing constipation developed by Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC). I base my management on these recommendations and hand the parent education notes to the mother. I tell her that the pediatric gastroenterologist wants me to start her son on this treatment while he is awaiting his appointment...|$|E
40|$|APO&# 8217;s North American editor, Joanna Mareth, writes from New York [...] . Photo: Joanna Mareth I&# 8217;M TEMPTED {{to stay in}} today. Not because I&# 8217;m {{afraid of}} another {{terrorist}} attack or unwilling to revisit the events of last year, but because there&# 8217;s so much television to watch. Channels 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9 are broadcasting uninterrupted coverage, without commercial breaks, beginning at 7 am. PBS, HBO, Cinemax, Showtime, Discovery, and A&E are all airing documentaries about {{various aspects of the}} attacks. New York cable station CUNY will be honoring the press with a special tribute to the news professionals behind the tributes. Thankfully, Animal Planet didn&# 8217;t feel the need {{to get in on the}} action. They&# 8217;re showing repeats of the Crocodile Hunter all day. Then there&# 8217;s the mountain of special edition newspapers, magazines, and supermarket tabloids, on the shelves for weeks already. And the radio stations playing inspirational music and asking popstars for wisdom. A day glued to the TV might be the most fitting tribute, since that&# 8217;s how most people &# 8211; myself included &# 8211; experienced September 11. But though I&# 8217;m sure a lot of the coverage will be moving and thoughtful, I don&# 8217;t think I can stand to watch any of it. In all these programs &# 8211; America Remembers or The Day that Changed America or Rebuilding America &# 8211; the names are similar and so is the task. Television will do what it does best: package for us &# 8211; in neat one and two-hour blocks &# 8211; a narrative and a bit of historical perspective. But this is a funny time for perspective. The conventional wisdom is that not that much has changed, and it&# 8217;s hard to disagree. Osama bin Laden is still at large. Anthrax remains unsolved. The war spirit that pushed Bush&# 8217;s approval ratings into the stratosphere has subsided, and we&# 8217;re left with the familiar feeling that our leader is in over his head. I suppose we should be grateful that additional terrorist gains have been few, unless you count the sidelining of nearly the entire American domestic political agenda. It seems that we are not yet entitled to the luxury of perspective. At Walden Pond (outside Boston), a place I like to go for solitude, there&# 8217;s a line from Thoreau inscribed at the site of his one-room cottage: &# 8220;I have my horizon, bounded by woods, all to myself,&# 8221; he said. The idea of guarding my own horizon is very much on my mind today. Last year, I read newspapers and watched CNN compulsively, looking for answers, hungry for stories. This year, I&# 8217;m exhausted by the media blitz. Which is why I decided to tune out the television and ignore the stacks of newspapers and head to New York today. To try out another tree metaphor: I wanted to look at the trees and try not to think too much about the forest. From the subway stop at City Hall, I head downtown to Ground Zero. It&# 8217;s a crisp, sunny day, and glass skyscrapers mirror the white cumulus clouds that are riding low and moving quickly across blue sky. It&# 8217;s not quite as perfect as the glorious late summer weather of last year; occasionally fierce gusts of wind kick up, blowing dust into everyone&# 8217;s faces. As I walk along Broadway, I&# 8217;m struck by how relatively quiet it is. I&# 8217;m aware of a stepped-up police presence, but there aren&# 8217;t that many people around. Then it dawns on me: I&# 8217;m walking in the wrong direction. Little Italy is only a few blocks up. Beyond that, the Empire State Building looms over midtown. I realize there are probably few people as directionally-challenged as I am, but for me The Twin Towers were always downtown anchors, beautiful in their obtrusiveness. I feel like even more of a dolt when I finally get to what is unmistakably the right place. There are literally thousands of people here, spilling off the sidewalks and bottle necking through police barricades. Many are wearing American flag t-shirts and carrying small flags (which are being hawked for $ 1. 00). Three men in bright orange jumpsuits that say &# 8220;Mexico&# 8221; are carrying a floral wreath overhead. Someone <b>hands</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> free CD: Amazing Grace as sung by the Antrim Mennonite Choir. Later I will be serenaded by the Antrim Mennonite Choir. In front of Trinity Church tens of thousands of origami cranes are strung up in delicate garlands. Another CD is pressed into my hand; this one is by the American Bible Society. Everybody is taking pictures. I needn&# 8217;t have worried that it would be insensitive to pull out my small, disposable camera, and soon I&# 8217;m snapping away too. 	 At Bowling Green Park, a raucous brass band is playing gospel music to an assembling crowd, some of whom are up on their feet and clapping along. I&# 8217;m actually having a good time, though I&# 8217;m not sure I should be. On the one hand, it&# 8217;s moving to see so many people here, doing exactly what they need to do, what they want to do, to reflect and remember. People are praying and crying and singing and clapping and handing out origami. Then again, I don&# 8217;t think I&# 8217;d want to be here now if I&# 8217;d been here then. This is New York putting on a brave face for the world, and non-New Yorkers showing their solidarity with the city. I hope people with personal connections to the Trade Center found comfort in more sombre memorials around the city. From my conversations with friends and strangers over the last few days, I get the sense that a lot of New Yorkers were relieved to get on with business as usual today. A day of remembrance seems in some ways odd, since no one here can imagine forgetting. A lot of things have changed since September 11; they had to. People are more fearful, but they&# 8217;re also more tuned in, to each other and the world. I&# 8217;m glad I was here &# 8211; and I&# 8217;m curious to see what tomorrow&# 8217;s papers will have to say about today&# 8217;s events...|$|E
