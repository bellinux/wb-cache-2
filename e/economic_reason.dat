25|$|Meanwhile, diving {{stores were}} finding a purely <b>economic</b> <b>reason</b> to offer nitrox: {{not only was}} an entire new course and {{certification}} needed to use it, but instead of cheap or free tank fills with compressed air, dive shops found they could charge premium amounts of money for custom-gas blending of nitrox to their ordinary, moderately experienced divers. With the new dive computers which could be programmed {{to allow for the}} longer bottom-times and shorter residual nitrogen times that nitrox gave, the incentive for the sport diver to use the gas increased. An intersection of economics and scientific validity had occurred.|$|E

2500|$|Quoting Harvard {{economics}} professor N.

[...] Most economists would agree that although increasing returns to scale might mean that certain industry could settle in a geographical area without any strong <b>economic</b> <b>reason</b> derived from comparative advantage, this is not a reason to argue against free trade because the absolute level of output enjoyed by both [...] "winner" [...] and [...] "loser" [...] will increase with the [...] "winner" [...] gaining more than the [...] "loser" [...] but both gaining more than before in an absolute level.|$|E

An unconscious hedonist, utterly unmoral and materialistic, he sought the greatest possible happiness for himself, and found it in drink.|$|E
