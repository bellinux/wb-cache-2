In Catalonia, there is an unparalleled large bilingual European non-state speech community. The teaching of Catalan is mandatory in all schools, but it is possible to use Spanish for studying in the public education system of Catalonia in two situations – <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> assigned to a class chooses to use Spanish, or during the learning process of one or more recently arrived immigrant students.

25|$|When Black is {{only one}} rank weaker (also known as one stone weaker, due to the close {{relationship}} between ranks and the handicap system), Black is given the advantage of playing Black, perhaps without komi, but without any mandatory White passes. For rank differences from two through nine stones, the appropriate number of handicap stones are used. Beyond nine stones, the difference in strength between the players is usually considered great enough that the game is more a lesson where White teaches Black than a competition. Thus, nine stones is the nominal upper limit on handicap stones regardless {{of the difference in}} rank (although higher numbers of stones, up to 41 stones in some cases, may be given <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> wants a greater challenge).|$|E
500|$|Owing to the {{suppression}} by Serbia of Apis's confession {{and of the}} Salonika trial transcripts historians did not initially link Malobabić closely to the Sarajevo attack. [...] Apis's confession, however, states that [...] "I engaged Malobabić to organize the assassination {{on the occasion of}} the announced arrival of Franz Ferdinand to Sarajevo." [...] At the Salonika trial, Colonel Ljubomir Vulović (head of the Serbian Frontiers Service) testified: [...] 'In 1914 on occasion of my official trip from Loznica to Belgrade, I received a letter at the General Staff [...] noting that agents of Malobabić would come and a teacher whose name I don't recall (Danilo Ilić was a teacher but it is unclear <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> in question was Ilić as Ilić can be placed in Brod but not Loznica) so I could sent [...] them into Bosnia.' Because of that 'I went to Loznica and either that day or very soon afterwards sent Rade and that teacher into Bosnia.' [...] Soon thereafter occurred the Sarajevo assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand." [...] On the eve of his execution, Malobabić told a priest: [...] "They ordered me to go to Sarajevo when that assassination was to take place, and when everything was over, they ordered me to come back and fulfill other missions, and then there was the outbreak of the war." [...] Vladimir Dedijer in The Road to Sarajevo presented additional testimonial evidence that Malobabić arrived in Sarajevo on the eve of the Sarajevo attack and gave the final go ahead for the operation to Danilo Ilić. This meshes with Dedijer's theory that Djuro Ŝarac had given instructions to Ilić on 16 June cancelling the assassination. [...] Soon after their confessions, Serbia executed Malobabić, Vulović, and Apis on false charges. Serbia published no clarifications of their confessions with regards to the Sarajevo attack.|$|E

2500|$|Hakuin's {{emphasis}} on koan practice {{had a strong}} influence in the Japanese Rinzai-school. In the system developed by his followers, students are assigned koans by their teacher and then meditate on them. Once they have broken through, they must demonstrate their insight in private interview with the teacher. [...] <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> feels the student has indeed attained a satisfactory insight into the koan, then another is assigned. Hakuin's main {{role in the development}} of this koan system was most likely the selection and creation of koans to be used. In this he didn't limit himself to the classic koan collections inherited from China; he himself originated one of the best-known koans, [...] "You know the sound of two hands clapping; tell me, what is the sound of one hand?". [...] Hakuin preferred this new koan to the most commonly assigned first koan from the Chinese tradition, the Mu koan. He believed his [...] "Sound of One Hand" [...] to be more effective in generating the great doubt, and remarked that [...] "its superiority to the former methods is like the difference between cloud and mud".|$|E

2500|$|Dapu (打譜) is the transcribing of old tablature into a playable form. Since qin tablature {{does not}} {{indicate}} note value, tempo or rhythm, the player must work it out for him/herself. Normally, qin players will learn the rhythm of a piece through a teacher or master. They sit facing one another, with the student copying the master. The tablature will only be consulted <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> is not sure of how to play a certain part. Because of this, traditional qinpu do not indicate them (though {{near the end of}} the Qing dynasty, a handful of qinpu had started to employ various rhythm indicating devices, such as dots). If one did not have a teacher, then one had to work out the rhythm by themselves. But it would be a mistake to assume that qin music is devoid of rhythm and melody. By the 20th century, there had been attempts to try to replace the [...] "jianzi pu" [...] notation, but so far, it has been unsuccessful; since the 20th century, qin music is generally printed with staff notation above the qin tablature. Because qin tablature is so useful, logical, easy, and the fastest way (once the performer knows how to read the notation) of learning a piece, it is invaluable to the qin player and cannot totally be replaced (just as staff notation cannot be replaced for Western instruments, because they developed a notation system that suited the instruments well).|$|E

Cases are continually occurring, and <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> will keep it constantly in mind, that when a particular case comes before the whole school, the object is an influence upon the whole, and not the punishment or reform of the guilty individual, he will insensibly so shape his measures, as to produce the desired result.|$|E

There may, alas! be some cases, where the use of the Scriptures is altogether forbidden in school.

60|$|Where {{the teacher}} has not {{sufficient}} confidence that the general sense of propriety among his pupils will preserve good order and decorum during the exercise, it may be better for him to read a prayer, selected from books of devotion, or prepared by himself expressly for the occasion. By this plan his school will be, during the exercise, under his own observation as at other times. It may, in some schools, where the number is small, or the prevailing habits of seriousness and order are good, be well to allow the older scholars to read the prayer in rotation, taking especial care {{that it does not}} degenerate into a mere reading exercise; but that it is understood, both by readers and hearers, to be a solemn act of religious worship. In a word, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> is really honest and sincere in his wish to lead his pupils to the worship of God, he will find no serious difficulty in preventing the abuses and avoiding the dangers which some might fear, and in accomplishing vast good, both in promoting the prosperity of the school, and {{in the formation of the}} highest and best traits a individual character.|$|E
60|$|Instead of {{deciding}} {{the question of}} the frequency of this general permission, the teacher may, if he pleases, leave it to the pupils to decide. It is often useful to leave the decision of such a question to them. On this subject, however, I shall speak in another place. It is only necessary, here, to say, that this point may be safely left to them, since the time is so small which is to be thus appropriated. Even if they vote to have the general permission to whisper every half hour, it will make but eight minutes in the forenoon. There being six half hours in the forenoon, and one of them ending at the close of school, and another at the recess, only four of these rests, as a military man would call them, would be necessary; and four, of two minutes each, would make eight minutes. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> thinks that evil would result from the interruption of the studies so often, he may offer the pupils three minutes rest every hour, instead of two minutes every half hour, and let them take their choice; or he may decide the case altogether himself.|$|E
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> then, will confine {{himself to}} such a portion of time, as is, in fact, all he can {{advantageously}} employ, there will be much left which can be devoted to his own private employment,--more than is usual in the other employments of life. In most of these other employments, {{there is not the}} same necessity for limiting the hours which a man may devote to his business. A merchant, for example, may be employed nearly all the day, at his counting-room, and so may a mechanic. A physician may spend all his waking-hours in visiting patients, and feel little more than healthy fatigue. The reason is that in all these employments, and in fact in most of the employments of life, {{there is so much to}} diversify, so many little incidents constantly occurring to animate and relieve, and so much bodily exercise, which alternates with, and suspends the fatigues of the mind, that the labors may be much longer continued, and with less cessation, and yet the health not suffer. But the teacher, while engaged in his work, has his mind continually on the stretch. There is little to relieve, little respite, and he is almost entirely deprived of bodily exercise. He must, consequently, limit his hours of attending to his business, or his health will soon sink under labors which Providence never intended the human mind to bear.|$|E
