25|$|Nevirapine is an inducer of {{cytochrome}} P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. It {{may reduce}} levels of several co-administered drugs including the antiretrovirals <b>efavirenz,</b> indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir, {{as well as}} clarithromycin, ketoconazole, forms of hormonal contraception, and methadone.|$|E
25|$|Nevirapine in triple {{combination}} therapy {{has been shown}} to suppress viral load effectively when used as initial antiretroviral therapy (i.e., in antiretroviral-naive patients). Some clinical trials have demonstrated comparable HIV suppression with nevirapine-based regimens to that achieved with protease inhibitors (PIs) or <b>efavirenz.</b>|$|E
25|$|If HIV {{treatment}} {{has to be}} started while a patient is still on TB treatment, then {{the advice of a}} specialist HIV pharmacist should be sought. In general, there is no significant interactions with the NRTI's. Nevirapine should not be used with rifampicin. <b>Efavirenz</b> may be used, but dose used depends on the patient's weight (600nbsp&mg daily if weight less than 50nbsp&kg; 800nbsp&mg daily if weight greater than 50nbsp&kg). <b>Efavirenz</b> levels should be checked early after starting treatment (unfortunately, this is not a service routinely offered in the US, but is readily available in the UK). The protease inhibitors should be avoided if at all possible: patients on rifamycins and protease inhibitors have an increased risk of treatment failure or relapse.|$|E
25|$|Four {{drugs in}} the class of NNRTIs have been {{approved}} by regulatory authorities. These are the first generation NNRTIs nevirapine, delavirdine and <b>efavirenz</b> and the next generation NNRTI etravirine. Several other NNRTIs underwent clinical development but were discontinued due to unfavourable pharmacokinetic, efficacy and/or safety factors.|$|E
25|$|Resistance to {{nevirapine}} develops rapidly if {{viral replication}} {{is not completely}} suppressed. The most common mutations observed after nevirapine treatment are Y181C and K103N, which are also observed with other NNRTIs. As all NNRTIs bind within the same pocket, viral strains which are resistant to nevirapine are usually also resistant to the other NNRTIs, <b>efavirenz</b> and delavirdine. However, second generation NNRTIs like rilpivirine and etravirine are effective in treatment for HIV strains resistant to nevirapine and other first generation drugs in that same class.|$|E
25|$|Mesuximide {{increases}} plasma {{levels of}} phenobarbital in primidone users, both primidone and phenobarbital accelerate the metabolism of carbamazepine via CYP3A4, and lamotrigine's apparent clearance is increased by primidone. In {{addition to being}} an inducer of CYP3A4, {{it is also an}} inducer of CYP1A2, which causes it to interact with substrates such as fluvoxamine, clozapine, olanzapine, and tricyclic antidepressants. It also interacts with CYP2B6 substrates such as bupropion, <b>efavirenz,</b> promethazine, selegiline, and sertraline; CYP2C8 substrates such as amiodarone, paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone; and CYP2C9 substrates such as bosentan, celecoxib, dapsone, fluoxetine, glimepiride, glipizide, losartan, montelukast, nateglinide, paclitaxel, phenytoin, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, warfarin, and zafirlukast. It also interacts with estrogens.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of {{atorvastatin}} {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This {{is less likely to}} happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, <b>efavirenz,</b> nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.|$|E
2500|$|Non-Nucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitors (NNRTI) inhibit {{reverse transcriptase}} by binding to an allosteric {{site of the}} enzyme; NNRTIs act as non-competitive inhibitors of reverse transcriptase. [...] NNRTIs affect the handling of substrate (nucleotides) by reverse transcriptase by binding near the active site. [...] NNRTIs can be further classified into 1st generation and 2nd generation NNRTIs. 1st generation NNRTIs include nevirapine and <b>efavirenz.</b> 2nd generation NNRTIs are etravirine and rilpivirine. HIV-2 is naturally resistant to NNRTIs.|$|E
2500|$|Alkynes {{occur in}} some pharmaceuticals, {{including}} the contraceptive noretynodrel. A carbon–carbon triple bond is {{also present in}} marketed drugs such as the antiretroviral <b>Efavirenz</b> and the antifungal Terbinafine. Molecules called ene-diynes feature a ring containing an alkene ("ene") between two alkyne groups ("diyne"). These compounds, e.g. calicheamicin, {{are some of the}} most aggressive antitumor drugs known, so much so that the ene-diyne subunit is sometimes referred to as a [...] "warhead". Ene-diynes undergo rearrangement via the Bergman cyclization, generating highly reactive radical intermediates that attack DNA within the tumor.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Efavirenz</b> {{is safe to}} {{use during}} the first {{trimester}} of pregnancy. [...] <b>Efavirenz</b> passes into breast milk and breast-fed infants may be exposed to <b>efavirenz.</b>|$|E
50|$|As most NNRTIs bind {{within the}} same pocket, viral strains which are {{resistant}} to <b>efavirenz</b> are usually also resistant to the other NNRTIs, nevirapine and delavirdine. The most common mutation observed after <b>efavirenz</b> treatment is K103N, which is also observed with other NNRTIs. Nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and <b>efavirenz</b> have different binding targets, so cross-resistance is unlikely; {{the same is true}} with regard to <b>efavirenz</b> and protease inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|In {{combination}} studies {{there were}} synergistic antiviral effects observed between emtricitabine and <b>efavirenz,</b> <b>efavirenz</b> and tenofovir, and emtricitabine and tenofovir.|$|E
50|$|<b>Efavirenz</b> {{is broken}} {{down in the}} liver by enzymes that belong to the {{cytochrome}} P450 system, which include both CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. <b>Efavirenz</b> is a substrate of these enzymes and can decrease the metabolism of other drugs that require the same enzymes. However, <b>efavirenz</b> also induces these enzymes, which means the enzyme activity is enhanced and the metabolism of other drugs broken down by CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 can be increased. People who are taking both <b>efavirenz</b> and other drugs metabolized by the same enzymes might need the dose of their drugs to be increased or decreased.|$|E
50|$|As of 2016, <b>efavirenz</b> was marketed {{in various}} jurisdictions under the brand names Adiva, Avifanz, Efamat, Efatec, Efavir, <b>Efavirenz,</b> Efcure, Eferven, Efrin, Erige, Estiva, Evirenz, Filginase, Stocrin, Sulfina V, Sustiva, Virorrever, and Zuletel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Efavirenz</b> is {{chemically}} {{described as}} (S)-6-chloro-(cyclopropylethynyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-3,1-benzoxazin-2-one. Its empirical formula is C14H9ClF3NO2. <b>Efavirenz</b> {{is a white}} to slightly pink crystalline powder with a molecular mass of 315.68 g/mol. It is practically insoluble in water (<10 µg/mL).|$|E
50|$|Another trial {{comparing}} dolutegravir to <b>efavirenz,</b> SINGLE, was {{the first}} trial to show statistical superiority to an efavirenz/FTC/TDF coformulated regimen for treatment naive patients. After 48 weeks of treatment, 88% of the dolutegravir group had HIV RNA levels < 50 copies / mL versus 81% of the <b>efavirenz</b> group. This has led one commentator to predict that it may replace <b>efavirenz</b> as the first line choice for initial therapy as {{it can also be}} formulated in one pill, once-a-day regimens.|$|E
50|$|<b>Efavirenz</b> has {{the trade}} names Sustiva and Stocrin.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Efavirenz</b> (brand name Sustiva, and a {{component}} of the combination drug Atripla) is classified as a category D drug by the US Food and Drug Administration indicating there are risks associated with its use during pregnancy. In a study analyzing the use of the drug in pregnant women, 2.3% of births were associated with birth defects. However, a systematic review of the safety of <b>efavirenz</b> use in humans during the first trimester found no increase in birth defects among women using the drug. Given the uncertain potential for risk the U.S. DHHS recommends against using <b>efavirenz</b> in the first trimester of pregnancy or in women who may become pregnant. They instead recommend a protease inhibitor based regimen with lopinavir or atazanavir. However, to simplify regimens and provide a uniform recommendation for HIV-infected individuals during pregnancy, the WHO continues to recommend <b>efavirenz</b> as a first line agent for HIV positive women. [...] Women using <b>efavirenz</b> prior to their pregnancy may continue with the drug as it is more dangerous to stop or change medications during pregnancy because this can result in improper control of the viral load.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Efavirenz,</b> an {{antiretroviral}} drug, produces psychiatric {{side effects}} {{thought to be}} mediated by 5-HT2A.|$|E
50|$|<b>Efavirenz</b> {{may cause}} convulsions in adult and {{pediatric}} populations {{who have a}} history of seizures.|$|E
50|$|Use of <b>efavirenz</b> {{can produce}} a false {{positive}} result in some urine tests for marijuana.|$|E
50|$|One {{group of}} drugs that <b>efavirenz</b> affects is {{protease}} inhibitors, which are used for HIV/AIDS. <b>Efavirenz</b> will lower the blood levels of most protease inhibitors, including aprenavir, atazanavir, and indinavir. At lowered levels, protease inhibitors may not be effective in people taking both drugs, which means {{the virus that causes}} HIV/AIDS won’t be stopped from replicating and may become resistant to the protease inhibitor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Efavirenz</b> was {{approved}} by the FDA on September 21, 1998, making it the 14th approved antiretroviral drug.|$|E
50|$|As of 2016, the {{combination}} of <b>efavirenz,</b> tenofovir, and lamivudine was marketed under the brand name Eflaten.|$|E
50|$|Efavirenz/lamivudine/tenofovir is a fixed dose {{combination}} {{medication for}} the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It combines <b>efavirenz,</b> lamivudine, and tenofovir.|$|E
5000|$|Zinc-acetylides {{are used}} in the HIV-1 reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitor <b>Efavirenz</b> as well as in Merck’s ephedrine derivatives [...]|$|E
50|$|<b>Efavirenz</b> {{also affects}} {{antifungal}} drugs, {{which are used}} for fungal infections such as urinary tract infections. Similar to the effect seen with protease inhibitors, <b>efavirenz</b> lowers the blood levels of antifungal drugs like voriconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and posaconazole. As a result of lowered levels, antifungal drugs may not be effective in people taking both drugs, {{which means that the}} fungi that cause the infection may become resistant to the antifungal.|$|E
50|$|Brazil {{carried out}} such a {{compulsory}} licensing threat {{for the first}} time in May 2007, on <b>efavirenz,</b> produced by Merck.|$|E
50|$|<b>Efavirenz</b> may {{lengthen}} the QT interval {{so should}} not be used in people with or at risk of Torsades de Pointes.|$|E
50|$|CYP3A4 activators, which {{decrease}} {{the amount of}} felodipine available per dose, include phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, barbiturates, <b>efavirenz,</b> nevirapine, and Saint John's wort.|$|E
50|$|<b>Efavirenz</b> is not {{effective}} against HIV-2, as {{the pocket of}} the HIV-2 reverse transcriptase has a different structure, which confers intrinsic resistance to the NNRTI class.|$|E

5000|$|As of 2016 the {{mechanism}} of efavirenz' neuropsychiatric adverse effects was not clear. [...] <b>Efavirenz</b> appears to have neurotoxicity, possibly by interfering with mitochondrial function, which may in turn possibly be caused by inhibiting creatine kinase but also possibly by disrupting mitochondrial membranes or by interfering with nitric oxide signalling. [...] Some neuropsychiatric adverse effects may be mediated through cannabinoid receptors, or through activity at the 5-HT2A receptor, but <b>efavirenz</b> interacts with many CNS receptors, {{so this is not}} clear. [...] The neuropsychiatric adverse effects are dose-dependent.|$|E
50|$|As of 2016, the {{combination}} of <b>efavirenz,</b> tenofovir, and emtricitabine was marketed in various jurisdictions under the brand names Atripla, Atroiza, Citenvir, Oditec, Teevir, Trustiva, Viraday, and Vonavir.|$|E
