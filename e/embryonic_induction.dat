40|$|AbstractPrevious {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the outer cornea can undergo transdifferentiation to form a lens in the tadpole larva of Xenopus laevis following removal of the original lens. This transformation appears to require an interaction with the neural retina. In the present study, we carried out a series of experiments to determine if the matured tadpole eye can also elicit lens formation in embryonic ectoderm. Labeled embryonic ectoderm was removed from the presumptive lens-forming region, or from the belly region (ventral ectoderm), at various stages of development (stages 11 - 19, gastrula to neural tube stages) and implanted into the eye cavity (posterior chamber) of advanced stage 52 - 55 tadpoles. After 3 days, we examined the tadpoles and their implanted tissues for lens cell formation using lens-specific antibodies. Implanted presumptive lens ectoderm differentiated lens cells in a large number of cases. The percentage of cases forming lens cells and the extent of morphological differentiation increased with increasing age of the implanted tissue. Implanted ventral ectoderm also formed lens cells, although at a reduced frequency and with limited morphological differentiation. These results indicate that the environment of the matured tadpole eye cavity stimulates lens cell formation in both presumptive lens and nonlens ectoderm. The development of the implanted tissues was compared to that found in previous studies where these tissues were cultured as explants or transplanted to lens-forming regions during early development and subjected to various periods of <b>embryonic</b> lens <b>induction.</b> Together, these findings suggest that the process of embryonic lens formation is related to that involved in transdifferentiation of the tadpole cornea during "lens regeneration. " However, the inductive effect of the matured tadpole eye is qualitatively {{different from that of the}} early period of <b>embryonic</b> lens <b>induction</b> and, while more intense, may be more closely related to that which takes place via the optic vesicle during the later phase of <b>embryonic</b> lens <b>induction...</b>|$|R

Interactions at their mutual boundary forms meso-endoderm. This is “meso-endoderm induction”, not just “mesoderm induction”. 2) The dorso-ventral polarity of the yolk mass implies a dorsally situated inducing centre. 3) Accumulation of cells into one, two, three or many cell masses [problastopores] along the circumference of the meso-endoderm results in as many axes, implying a self-organizing capacity of meso-endoderm. 4) Induction of the meso-endoderm is slow, spreading cell to cell through the animal moiety from the boundary of the vegetal yolk mass towards the animal pole. 5) Interaction between mesoderm and ectoderm is a separate step leading to cranio-caudal differentiation of the archenteron roof. 6) The initial invaginating endoderm and mesoderm, representing the future pharynx endoderm and prechordal plate mesoderm, first contacts the most posterior presumptive neurectoderm after having passed the still uninvaginated trunk mesoderm. At that moment an antero-posterior level neural induction actually starts. 7) The ectoderm contraction wave coincides spatially and temporally with the induced neural plate. 8) Two successive homoiogenetic waves of inductive activity pass through the presumptive neurectoderm in the anterior direction, the first one, “activation”, givin...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{neural crest}} is a {{population}} of highly migratory and multipotent cells, which arises from {{the border of the}} neural plate in vertebrate embryos. In the last few years, the molecular actors of neural crest early development have been intensively studied, notably by using the frog embryo, as a prime model for the analysis of the earliest <b>embryonic</b> <b>inductions.</b> In addition, tremendous {{progress has been made in}} understanding the molecular and cellular basis of Xenopus cranial neural crest migration, by combining in vitro and in vivo analysis. In this review, we examine how the action of previously known neural crest-inducing signals [bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), wingless-int (Wnt), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ] is controlled by newly discovered modulators during early neural plate border patterning and neural crest specification. This regulation controls the induction of key transcription factors that cooperate to pattern the premigratory neural crest progenitors. These data are discussed in the perspective of the gene regulatory network that controls neural and neural crest patterning. We then address recent findings on noncanonical Wnt signaling regulation, cell polarization, and collective cell migration which highlight how cranial neural crest cells populate their target tissue, the branchial arches, in vivo. More than ever, the neural crest stands as a powerful and attractive model to decipher complex vertebrate regulatory circuits in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Few {{directed}} searches {{have been}} undertaken {{to identify the}} genes involved in vertebrate lens formation. In the frog Xenopus, the larval cornea can undergo a process of transdifferentiation {{to form a new}} lens once the original lens is removed. Based on preliminary evidence, we have shown that this process shares many elements of a common molecular/genetic pathway to that involved in embryonic lens development. A subtracted cDNA library, enriched for genes expressed during cornea-lens transdifferentiation, was prepared. The similarities/identities of specific clones isolated from the subtracted cDNA library define an expression profile of cells undergoing cornea-lens transdifferentiation (2 ̆ 2 lens regeneration 2 ̆ 2) and corneal wound healing (the latter representing a consequence of the surgery required to trigger transdifferentiation). Screens were undertaken to search for genes expressed during both transdifferentiation and embryonic lens development. Significantly, new genes were recovered that are also expressed during embryonic lens development. The expression of these genes, as well as others known to be expressed during embryonic development in Xenopus, can be correlated with different periods of <b>embryonic</b> lens <b>induction</b> and development, in an attempt to define these events in a molecular context. This information is considered in light of our current working model of <b>embryonic</b> lens <b>induction,</b> in which specific tissue properties and phases of induction have been previously defined in an experimental context.

[...] Together with his colleagues, he discovered Chordin, a protein secreted by dorsal cells that binds Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) growth factors facilitating their transport to the ventral side of the embryo, where Chordin is digested by a protease called Tolloid, so that BMPs can signal again. [...] This flow of growth factors determines dorsal (back) to ventral (belly) cell and tissue differentiations in many bilateral animals, such as fruit flies, spiders, early chordates and mammals. The Chordin/BMP/Tolloid biochemical pathway is regulated by feedback inhibitors and cross-talk with other signaling pathways.

40|$|Embryonic {{stem cells}} (ESCs) and induced {{pluripotent}} stem cells (iPSCs) have the potential to differentiate into various types of cells including skeletal muscle cells. The approach of converting ESCs/iPSCs into skeletal muscle cells offers hope for patients afflicted with the skeletal muscle diseases such as the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Patient-derived iPSCs are an especially ideal cell source to obtain an unlimited number of myogenic cells that escape immune rejection after engraftment.

40|$|Exposure {{of insect}} larvae to {{sublethal}} concentrations of crystal toxins {{from the soil}} bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt toxins) causes the induction of immune and metabolic responses that can be transmitted to offspring by epigenetic inheritance mechanisms.

A laboratory culture of Helicoverpa armigera was induced by a sublethal bacterial suspension containing crystal toxin Cry 1 Ac in one generation and maintained {{in the presence of}} toxin, acquiring significant levels of tolerance to the toxin within 12 generations of continuous exposure. Comparing tolerant and susceptible insects, we show that the induction of larval immune response and the coincident alteration of development-related metabolic activities by elicitors in the larval gut (larval induction) differs from the elevated immune status transmitted by epigenetic mechanisms (<b>embryonic</b> <b>induction).</b> Because the damaging effects of larval induction processes are higher compared to <b>embryonic</b> <b>induction,</b> it is likely that overall developmental penalties depend on the relative contribution of the two induction processes.

40|$|Background: Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI) due to {{coronary artery}} disease {{remains one of the}} leading causes of premature death. Replacement of infarcted heart tissue with regenerating myocardium from endogenous progenitor pools or exogenously introduced stem cells remains a therapeutic ideal. Their impracticality mainly lies in their low efficiency in cardiogenic differentiation (CD). Our recent studies with an acute MI animal model have already demonstrated the therapeutic effect of the MeOH extract of Geum japonicum (EGJ), providing clear evidence of myocardial regeneration. Methods and Findings: The present study further isolated the active component contained in EGJ using bioassay-guided isolation and investigated its efficacy in the treatment of infarcted heart in animal MI models. We demonstrated that substantial repair of infarcted heart in animal MI models by EGJ can be mimicked by the isolated candidate compound (cardiogenin) in MI animal models. Clear evidence of newly regenerated endogenous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived cardiomyocytes was observed throughout the infarct zone, accompanied by significantly improved functional performance of the heart. Transplantation of MSCs pretreated with EGJ or cardiogenin into a MI animal model also resulted in substantial regeneration of functional myocardium, implying that the activated MSCs carry all the necessary blueprints for myocardial regeneration.

Here, we examine the role of different Axin domains in the effects on axis formation and β-catenin levels. We find that the regulators of G-protein signaling domain (major APC-binding site) and GSK 3 β-binding site are required, whereas the COOH-terminal sequences, including a protein phosphatase 2 A binding site and the DIX domain, are not essential. Some forms of Axin lacking the β-catenin binding site can still interact indirectly with β-catenin and regulate β-catenin levels and axis formation. Thus in normal embryonic cells, interaction with APC and GSK 3 β is critical for the ability of Axin to regulate signaling via β-catenin. Myc-tagged Axin is localized in a characteristic pattern of intracellular spots {{as well as at the}} plasma membrane. NH 2 -terminal sequences were required for targeting to either of these sites, whereas COOH-terminal sequences increased localization at the spots.

40|$|Friedreich ataxia is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease caused by a GAA triplet repeat expansion in the first intron of the frataxin gene, which results in reduced expression levels of the corresponding protein. Despite numerous animal and cellular models, therapeutic options that mechanistically address impaired frataxin expression are lacking. Here, we have developed a new mammalian cell model employing the Cre/loxP recombination system to induce a homozygous or heterozygous frataxin knockout in mouse <b>embryonic</b> fibroblasts. <b>Induction</b> of Cre-mediated disruption by tamoxifen was successfully tested on RNA and protein levels. After loss of frataxin protein, cell division, aconitase activity and oxygen consumption rates {{were found to be}} decreased, while ROS production was increased in the homozygous state. By contrast, in the heterozygous state no such changes were observed. A time-resolved analysis revealed the loss of aconitase activity as an initial event after induction of complete frataxin deficiency, followed by secondarily elevated ROS production and a late increase in iron content. Initial impairments of oxygen consumption and ATP production were found to be compensated in the late state and seemed to play a minor role in Friedreich ataxia pathophysiology. In conclusion and as predicted from its proposed role in iron sulfur cluster (ISC) biosynthesis, disruption of frataxin primarily causes impaired function of ISC-containing enzymes, whereas other consequences, including elevated ROS production and iron accumulation, appear secondary. These parameters and the robustness of the newly established system may additionally be used for a time-resolved study of pharmacological candidates in a HTS manner...|$|R

In this context, using the ubiquitous CMV-CreERT 2 transgenic mice, we have tested and validated two procedures to achieve recombination just before and just after birth. The efficiency of recombination was evaluated in the brain, which is known to be more problematic to target. For the late gestation treatment with tamoxifen, different protocols of complementary administration of progesterone and estrogen were tested. However, delayed delivery and/or mortality of pups due to difficult delivery were always observed. To circumvent this problem, pups were collected from tamoxifen-treated pregnant dams by caesarian section at E 18. 5 and given to foster mothers. For postnatal treatment, different dosages of tamoxifen were administered by intragastric injection to the pups during 3 or 4 days after birth. The efficiency of these treatments was analyzed at P 7 using a transgenic reporter line. They were also validated with the Hoxa 5 conditional allele.

40|$|A {{reexamination of}} the {{expression}} of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) during {{the development of the}} chicken embryo was carried out using more sensitive immunocytochemical techniques than had been used previously. While the previously determined sequence of CAM expression was confirmed, neural CAM (N-CAM) was also detected on endodermal structures such as the lung epithelium, gut epithelium, and pancreas and on budding structures such as the pancreatic duct and gall bladder. It was also found on ectodermal derivatives of the skin. In most of these sites, N-CAM expression was transient, but in the chicken embryo lung, the epithelium remained positive for N-CAM and liver CAM (L-CAM) into adult life. Thus, at one time or another, both of these primary CAMs can be expressed on derivatives of all three germ layers. At sites of <b>embryonic</b> <b>induction,</b> epithelial cells expressing both L-CAM and N-CAM, or L-CAM only, were apposed to mesenchymal cells expressing N-CAM. Examples included epiblast (NL) and notochord (N); endodermal epithelium (NL) and lung mesenchyme (N); Wolffian duct (NL) and mesonephric mesenchyme (N); apical ectodermal ridge (NL) and limb mesenchyme (N); and feather placode (L) and dermal condensation (N). The cumulative observations indicate that cell surface modulation of the primary CAMs at induction sites can be classified into two modes. In mode I, expression of N-CAM (or both CAMs) in mesenchyme decreases to low amounts at the cell surface, and then N-CAM is reexpressed. In mode II, one or the other CAM disappears from epithelia expressing both CAMs. As a result of the primary processes of development, collectives of cells linked by N-CAM and undergoing modulation mode I are brought into the proximity of collectives of cells linked by L-CAM plus N-CAM or by L-CAM undergoing modulation mode II.

Antibodies to gap junction protein were shown to block gap junction communication for the whole of the induction time, but did not prevent successful induction of muscle gene activation. The outcome was the same whether communication between inducing vegetal cells and responding animal cells was blocked by introducing antibodies into vegetal cells alone or into animal cells alone. We conclude that gap junctions are not required for this example of <b>embryonic</b> <b>induction...</b>|$|E

Here we report that in Xenopus expression of Pax- 6 results in lens formation in a cell autonomous manner. In animal cap experiments, Pax- 6 induced expression of the lens-specific marker bB 1 -crystallin without inducing the general neural marker NCAM. Ectopic Pax- 6 expression also resulted in the formation of ectopic lenses in whole embryos as well as in animal cap explants indicating that in vertebrates, as well as Drosophila (Halder, G., Callaerts, P., and Gehring, W. J. (1995) Science 267, 1788 – 1792), Pax- 6 can direct the development of major components of the eye. Interestingly, ectopic lenses formed in whole embryos without association with neural tissue. Treatments giving rise to anterior neural tissue in animal cap explants resulted in the expression of both bB 1 -crystalli...|$|E
40|$|The {{interplay between}} bone {{morphogenetic}} proteins (BMPs) and their antagonists governs developmental and cellular processes {{as diverse as}} establishment of the <b>embryonic</b> dorsal-ventral axis, <b>induction</b> of neural tissue, formation of joints in the skeletal system and neurogenesis in the adult brain. So far, the three-dimensional structures of BMP antagonists and the structural basis for inactivation have remained unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the antagonist Noggin bound to BMP- 7, which shows that Noggin inhibits BMP signalling by blocking the molecular interfaces of the binding epitopes for both type I and type II receptors. The BMP- 7 -binding affinity of site-specific variants of Noggin is correlated with alterations in bone formation and apoptosis in chick limb development, showing that Noggin functions by sequestering its ligand in an inactive complex. The scaffold of Noggin contains a cystine (the oxidized form of cysteine) knot topology {{similar to that of}} BMPs; thus, ligand and antagonist seem to have evolved from a common ancestral gene...|$|R
40|$|Differentiation {{induction}} {{of neural}} stem cells (NSCs) into oligodendrocytes during embryogenesis {{is the result}} of a complex interaction between local induction factors and intracellular transcription factors. At the early stage of differentiation, in particular, the helix-loop-helix transcription factors Olig 1 and Olig 2 have been shown to be essential for oligodendrocyte lineage determination. In view of the possible application of NSCs as a source for remyelinating cell transplants in demyetinating diseases (e. g., multiple sclerosis), in vitro procedures need to be developed to drive the otigodendrocyte differentiation process. Mere culture in medium supplemented with major <b>embryonic</b> oligodendrogenic <b>induction</b> factors, such as Sonic hedgehog, results in oligodendrocyte differentiation of only about 10 % of NSCs. We previously showed that induction of Ofig 1 expression by gene transfection could indeed initiate the first stage of oligodendrocyte differentiation in NSCs, but appeared to be unable to generate fully mature, functional oligodendrocytes. In this study, we transfected NSCs isolated from the embryonic mouse brain with the Olig 2 gene and found that the introduced overexpression of Olig 2 could induce the development of fully mature oligodendrocytes expressing the transcription factor Nkx 2. 2 and all major myelin-specific proteins. Moreover, Olig 2 -transfected NSCs, in contrast to nontransfected NSCs, developed into actively remyelinating oligodendrocytes; after transplantation into the corpus callosum of long-term cuprizone-fed mice, an animal model for demyelination. Our results show that transfection of genes encoding for oligodendrogenic transcription factors can be an efficient way to induce the differentiation of NSCs into functional oligodendrocytes...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a report}} of some new {{observations}} on cartilage and bone induction in post-foetal life. Several hundred <b>embryonic</b> and post-foetal <b>induction</b> systems have been described {{in the literature on}} cell and organ differentiation (Jacobson 1966), but few have advanced present knowledge of skeletal tissue morphogenesis, and none has noted the two separate pathways of development in transplants of articular cartilage. Urist and McLean (1952) observed that full-thickness transplants of homogenous articular cartilage from young rats induced formation of bone tissue in the anterior chamber of the eye. Using the same laboratory technique, experiments to be presented in this communication will demonstrate that the gliding surface of articular cartilage induces only fibrous tissue or hyaline cartilage formation, whereas the epiphysial surface of a growing young rat will induce bone formation. The transplants will consist of cells and matrix labelled with radioactive isotopes in young and old, living and dead, split-thickness and full-thickness isogenous articular cartilage. The results will suggest that modulating 3 H-thymidine-labelled chondrocytes may act as inducing cells, and that 3 H-glycine-labelled or S-labelled cartilage matrix may act as inducing surfaces for osteogenesis.
