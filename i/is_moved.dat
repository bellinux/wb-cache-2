5|$|Although the Madonna's throne {{is in the}} mid-ground, {{her head}} is level with the {{standing}} figures in the foreground, who are closer in perspective. The apse in which she sits adds to the illusion of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach {{can be seen in}} the later Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne <b>is</b> <b>moved</b> back, and the donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E
5|$|An {{infinite}} loop may occur if the exit {{conditions for the}} loop are not defined correctly. Once L exceeds R, the search has failed and must convey {{the failure of the}} search. In addition, the loop must be exited when the target element is found, {{or in the case of}} an implementation where this check <b>is</b> <b>moved</b> to the end, checks for whether the search was successful or failed at the end must be in place. Bentley found that, in his assignment of binary search, most of the programmers who implemented binary search incorrectly made an error defining the exit conditions.|$|E

5|$|Frogs {{that live}} in or visit water have adaptations that improve their {{swimming}} abilities. The hind limbs are heavily muscled and strong. The webbing between the toes of the hind feet increases {{the area of the}} foot and helps propel the frog powerfully through the water. Members of the family Pipidae are wholly aquatic and show the most marked specialization. They have inflexible vertebral columns, flattened, streamlined bodies, lateral line systems, and powerful hind limbs with large webbed feet. Tadpoles mostly have large tail fins which provide thrust when the tail <b>is</b> <b>moved</b> from side to side.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015 in the U.S., the PancakeBot pancake machine {{received}} over $141,000 on Kickstarter. Its target donation request on {{the website}} was $50,000. PancakeBot can produce custom pancakes in various designs, which is performed {{by the use of}} pancake batter in a bottle that <b>is</b> <b>moved</b> by a programmable machine arm atop the griddle. The machine utilizes custom software to accomplish this.|$|E
5|$|Naming {{groups of}} organisms {{in a way}} that is clear and widely agreed is important, as some {{disputes}} in paleontology have been based just on misunderstandings over names. Linnaean taxonomy is commonly used for classifying living organisms, but runs into difficulties when dealing with newly discovered organisms that are significantly different from known ones. For example: it is hard to decide at what level to place a new higher-level grouping, e.g. genus or family or order; this is important since the Linnaean rules for naming groups are tied to their levels, and hence if a group <b>is</b> <b>moved</b> to a different level it must be renamed.|$|E

5|$|Night falls, and Captain Magenta detects {{an unusual}} signal in the Cloudbase Radar Room. Rhapsody Angel is {{launched}} {{to investigate and}} finds that the readings are emanating from a spinning Mysteron spacecraft, which obliterates her interceptor in mid-air. To prevent civilian casualties on the ground, Cloudbase <b>is</b> <b>moved</b> into Himalayan airspace on its horizontal thrusters, while its personnel prepare for the inevitable final confrontation. When more spacecraft appear on the radar, Captain Scarlet volunteers to challenge the Mysterons in Destiny's place, but crash-lands on the Cloudbase flight deck after his interceptor is damaged.|$|E
5|$|One {{application}} of this principle arises in a film projector. In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each frame of film stops for {{a fraction of a second}} in front of the projector lens, and then much more quickly the film <b>is</b> <b>moved</b> to the next frame. This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an actuator that pulls the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film's motion while the frame is projected.|$|E

5|$|The LCRV {{is one of}} {{the most}} densely {{populated}} areas along the river, and there are numerous towns including Bullhead City, Arizona, Needles, California, and Lake Havasu City, Arizona. Here, many diversions draw from the river, providing water for both local uses and distant regions including the Salt River Valley of Arizona and metropolitan Southern California. The last major U.S. diversion is at Imperial Dam, where over 90percent of the river's remaining flow <b>is</b> <b>moved</b> into the All-American Canal to irrigate California's Imperial Valley, the most productive winter agricultural region in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the series, Sasuke {{is shown}} as silent {{character}} who seeks to become stronger {{by any means}} in order to kill his older brother, Itachi Uchiha, for betraying and murdering their entire clan. Nevertheless, Sasuke <b>is</b> <b>moved</b> when Naruto Uzumaki wants him {{to make peace with}} the village. As a result, Sasuke considers Naruto his only friend. By the end of the series, Sasuke becomes more kindhearted, but decides not to return to his home, choosing instead to redeem himself and search for an enemy threatening the peace in Konohagakure.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the epic}} poem Mahabharata, Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, {{but on the}} {{condition}} that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield, and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna <b>is</b> <b>moved</b> and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his Gandiv (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E

5|$|Crisis Core is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} {{game in which}} the player controls Zack Fair. The player moves Zack through and between open areas, allowing him to talk with non-player characters, interact with the environment, and engage monsters in battle. At save points, the player may opt {{to take one of}} the available side missions, and if so, Zack <b>is</b> <b>moved</b> to a special area to complete the mission, which usually involves defeating one or more monsters. If the mission is successfully completed, the player is rewarded with beneficial items, and often new missions become available. Whether the player is successful in the side mission or not, upon completion, Zack is returned to the save point in the main game.|$|E
5|$|During an altercation on {{a crowded}} subway platform, John Lange (Vincent D'Onofrio) falls against a moving train and is pinned at waist level between a subway car and {{the edge of the}} platform. Detectives Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) arrive to {{investigate}} and are told the man's spinal cord is severed. Although Lange is not feeling much pain, emergency personnel tell the detectives he has less than an hour to live and will die as soon as he <b>is</b> <b>moved.</b> Bayliss questions Larry Biedron (Bruce MacVittie), who was involved with the altercation that led to Lange's fall. Biedron says he was bumped from behind with Lange, but witnesses give conflicting reports: Some say that Biedron pushed Lange, some that Lange pushed Biedron, and others say that it was an accident. Pembleton tries to talk to Lange, who becomes uncooperative and angry when told he will die.|$|E
5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove and solid particles, {{before it is}} released from the chimney. Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from the filters contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning <b>is</b> <b>moved</b> by converyor to a bunker. Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes ferrous metal from the ash for recycling. The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in the construction industry.|$|E
50|$|In the {{horizontal}} columns a card may <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> {{to any other}} card in the column {{as long as it}} is in descending numerical sequence. For example, a six of hearts may <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> to a seven of any suit. However, a sequence of cards can only <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> if they <b>are</b> all of the same suit in numerical descending order. For example, a six and seven of hearts may <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> to an eight of any suit, but a six of hearts and seven of clubs cannot <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> together. Moving the top card in a column allows the topmost hidden card to be turned over. This card then enters into the play. Other cards can be placed on it, and it can <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> to other cards in a sequence or to an empty column.|$|R
