25|$|There {{has also}} been some {{secondary}} migration of Somalis to the UK from the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark. According to refugee expert Jill Rutter, in some locations, secondary migrants make {{up the majority of}} the Somali community. An academic article published in 2011 suggests that, since 2000, between 10,000 and 20,000 Somalis in the Netherlands have moved to the UK. The driving forces behind this secondary migration included: a desire to reunite with family and friends; a rise in Dutch opposition to Muslim immigration; Somali opposition to <b>housing</b> <b>policies</b> which forced them to live scattered in small groups all over various cities rather than in a larger agglomerated community; a restrictive socio-economic environment which, among other things, made it difficult for new arrivals to find work; and the comparative ease of starting a business and acquiring the means to get off social welfare in the UK. Research into this relocation also suggests that some Somali migrants in the Netherlands did not intend to end up there as a final destination. Their journeys may have been interrupted in the Netherlands, or they may have had little choice about their destination. As a result, some secondary migration {{can be seen in the}} context of the desire to complete an intended migration to the UK.|$|E

The city, he said, had violent 'no-go' areas, where [...] "you can expect to be mugged," [...] created through drug abuse and hopelessness, and populated by people who [...] "don't work, have no money, and rarely leave the houses that they find themselves living in before dark." [...] Ronson highlighted a city of contrasts, where [...] "expensive canal-side cafes are springing up faster than you can count them: the joke around town is that you can sip cappuccino all day and gaze out at the corpses floating past."

La Jolla had a history of restrictive <b>housing</b> <b>policies,</b> often specified in deeds and ownership documents. In La Jolla Shores and La Jolla Hermosa, only people with pure European ancestry could own property; this excluded Jews, who were not considered white. Such [...] "restrictive covenants" [...] were once fairly common throughout the United States; the 1948 Supreme Court case Shelley v. Kraemer ruled them to be unenforceable, and Congress outlawed them twenty years later via the Fair Housing Act (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968). However, realtors and property owners in La Jolla continued to use more subtle ways of preventing or discouraging Jews from owning property there. Revelle stated the issue bluntly: [...] "You can't have a university without having Jewish professors. The Real Estate Broker's Association and their supporters in La Jolla had to make up their minds whether they wanted a university or an anti-Semitic covenant. You couldn't have both." [...] The issue was overcome; La Jolla now boasts a thriving Jewish population, and there are four synagogues in La Jolla.|$|E
2500|$|As Secretary, Cisneros {{attacked}} head on fair <b>housing</b> <b>policies.</b> [...] “Fair housing,” he told Guy Gugliotta of the Washington Post, “is so {{vital that}} we cannot accomplish {{any of the}} other goals without it.” [...] He unveiled a plan for HUD to provide $70 million in housing vouchers enabling low-income Americans to rent living space in the communities of their choice, an idea that brought Cisneros criticism in affluent circles in his native Texas and elsewhere. [...] When it came to justice in home loans, Cisneros, through his agency, stood firm to lenders by letting them know that HUD would no longer tolerate unfairly denying minorities access to home loans, and aggressively penalized lenders who broke fair lending laws. [...] The department also made it easier for alleged victims of fair housing to file complaints. During Cisneros's four-year term, the agency's decisions in favor of victims of housing discrimination resulted in the awarding of a total of $80 million in damages, compared with $13 million in the previous four years. Cisneros greatly eased the bureaucracy to deal with fair housing issues much swifter. [...] "The train started to run on time," [...] with complaints being heard much faster, said John Relman of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. [...] "It's hard to find somebody in that position who could be more supportive of fair housing than Henry Cisneros." ...|$|E

However, he fails to support his argument with credible evidence. My comments point out the most egregious of Crump's claims.

2500|$|San Diego has {{historically}} been a destination for Filipino immigrants, and {{has contributed to the}} growth of its population. The first documentation of Filipinos arriving in San Diego, while part of the United States, occurred in 1903 when Filipino students arrived at State Normal School; they were followed as early as 1908 by Filipino Sailors serving in the United States Navy. Due to discriminatory <b>housing</b> <b>policies</b> of the time, the majority of Filipinos in San Diego lived downtown, around Market Street, then known as [...] "Skids Row". Prior to World War II, due to anti-miscegenation laws, multi-racial marriages with Hispanic and Latino women were common, particularly with Mexicans. In the 1940s and 1950s, Filipino Americans were the largest population of Asians within the city of San Diego, with a population around five hundred. After World War II, the majority of Filipino Americans in San Diego were associated with the U.S. Navy in one form or another, even in the late 1970s and early 1980s more than half of Filipino babies born in the greater San Diego area were born at Balboa Naval Hospital. In the 1970s, the typical Filipino family consisted of a husband whose employment was connected to the military, and a wife who was a nurse. Many Filipino American veterans, after completing active duty, would move out of San Diego, to the suburbs of Chula Vista and National City.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that the {{discourse}} of globalization has dominated <b>housing</b> <b>policy</b> in Britain in the last decade. This proposition is supported by a description of recent <b>housing</b> <b>policy</b> concerns and a tracing of their roots in the globalization discourse.

This paper then questions whether there is a viable alternative to the neo-liberal approach of recent <b>housing</b> <b>policy.</b> It is argued that the traditional social democratic approach is ill-suited to the environment created by globalization. However, the paper concludes with an outline of an alternative policy approach which focuses on key issues which globalization brings to the fore, such as risk, social solidarity, and the pursuit of control and self-esteem. It is argued that, taken together, these issues could constitute a new <b>policy</b> model. <b>Housing</b> <b>policy,</b> globalization,...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on <b>housing</b> <b>policy</b> in Canada since 1945 with a {{particular}} emphasis on the period since 1986 when the federal government began its withdrawal from <b>housing</b> <b>policy.</b> The paper applies existing theories of policy change, namely innovation, convergence, policy learning, and policy inheritance to the five phases of <b>housing</b> <b>policy</b> that have occurred in postwar Canada. It also incorporates two surveys of provincial <b>housing</b> <b>policy</b> conducted by the authors in 1994 and 1997 to assess the changes that have occurred since the federal government withdrawal in 1996. The analysis suggests that within a broader model of the policy process which deals with both periods of change and non-change, the theories of change can explain previous periods of activism, but the model can also explain the current period which can best be described by inertia. This inertia is understandable because the preceding conditions for change which existed in the earlier phases of <b>housing</b> <b>policy</b> are largely absent today. ...|$|R
