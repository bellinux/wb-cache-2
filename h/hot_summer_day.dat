5|$|Longstanding racial {{tensions}} between {{whites and blacks}} exploded in five days of violence that started on July 27, 1919. On that <b>hot</b> <b>summer</b> <b>day,</b> on a segregated Chicago beach, a white man was throwing rocks at black swimmers in the water at a beach on the South Side which resulted in Eugene Williams' death. Tensions escalated when a white police officer not only failed to arrest the white man responsible for Williams' death, but arrested a black man instead. Objections by black observers were met with violence by whites. Attacks between white and black mobs erupted swiftly. At one point, a white mob threatened Provident Hospital, many of whose patients were African American. The police successfully held them off.|$|E
5|$|The {{uprising}} {{was launched}} on the <b>hot</b> <b>summer</b> <b>day</b> of 2 August 1943 (Monday, a regular {{day of rest}} from gassing), {{when a group of}} Germans and 40 Ukrainians drove off to the River Bug to swim. The conspirators silently unlocked the door to the arsenal near the train tracks, with a key that had been duplicated earlier. They had stolen 20–25 rifles, 20 hand grenades, and several pistols, and delivered them in a cart to the gravel work detail. At 3:45p.m., 700 Jews launched an insurgency that lasted for 30 minutes. They set buildings ablaze, exploded a tank of petrol, and set fire to the surrounding structures. A group of armed Jews attacked the main gate, and others attempted to climb the fence. Machine-gun fire from about 25 Germans and 60 Ukrainian Trawnikis resulted in near-total slaughter. Lajcher was killed along with most of the insurgents. About 200 Jews escaped from the camp. Half of them were killed after a chase in cars and on horses. The Jews did not cut the phone wires, and Stangl called in hundreds of German reinforcements, who arrived from four different towns and set up roadblocks along the way. Partisans of the Armia Krajowa (Polish: Home Army) transported some of the surviving escapees across the river and others like Sperling ran 30 kilometres (19 miles) and were then helped and fed by Polish villagers. Of those who broke through, around 70 are known to have survived {{until the end of the}} war, including the future authors of published Treblinka memoirs: Richard Glazar, Chil Rajchman, Jankiel Wiernik, and Samuel Willenberg.|$|E

This was interpreted as a hostile move by the Ethiopians, and eleven were hospitalized after the resulting fracas.|$|E

500|$|Two music videos, both {{directed}} by David LaChapelle, were shot {{for the song}} and its accompanying remix. The videos introduced a less demure image of Carey, one that received negative backlash from critics. She appears in the video with a lighter hair color than she had sported in the past, and wearing a series of revealing ensembles. Reviewers disregarded Carey's newer image, primarily her double-handkerchief bra, and likened her to younger pop singers such as Britney Spears, which they felt cheapened the singer. The video begins with Cameo driving all over a racetrack, while Carey, dressed in revealing clothing, is shown singing in various [...] "car girl" [...] positions at the track on a <b>hot</b> <b>summer</b> <b>day.</b> She flags down cars as the [...] "flag girl" [...] and dances as a [...] "tire girl" [...] in a kaleidoscope-inspired sequence, before jumping out of a pop out cake to the roars of the crowd below. [...] Several other scenes of Carey in a pink jumpsuit while riding {{on top of a}} race-car are shown, during which Cameo continues the race. A video was also made for the remix and retains most of the shots of the original. In it, Ludacris and Shawnna can be seen rapping together as they ride in an old car, while Da Brat and Twenty II rap together in a more modern car without a hood.|$|E
500|$|After sailing {{back to the}} United States, Saratoga loaded 1,200 {{passengers}} at Hoboken, New Jersey, on 30 July, a <b>hot</b> <b>summer</b> <b>day.</b> In {{preparation for}} sailing for France the next day, the transport sailed to an anchorage at Tompkinsville, Staten Island. Among the passengers on board were nurses of [...] the Army's Base Hospital No. 8. To escape the sweltering heat aboard the ship, many of the nurses on board returned to their cabins after lunch and removed their heavy wool uniforms. While at anchor at about 13:30, Saratoga was rammed in the port quarter by [...] of the Panama Steamship Company after her engine room misunderstood a command from the bridge. The force of the impact buckled plating from Saratogas rail down to the waterline, leaving a [...] hole. Saratoga began to list almost immediately, and the abandon ship signal was given soon after. The passengers, including nurses {{in various states of}} undress, reported to their assigned lifeboats and evacuated the ship in an orderly fashion. The close proximity to shore, and the large number of smaller craft in the vicinity, allowed all on board to be rescued without loss of life or injury. Panama had only superficial damage; Saratoga raised anchor and was towed near the Morse Dry Dock & Repair Company where she was allowed to settle in the mud. The erstwhile Saratoga passengers were collected from the various rescue craft and were loaded onto , where they sailed for France on 6 August.|$|E

2500|$|Nageire, meaning [...] "thrown in", is {{associated}} with the legendary story of a samurai. The legend states that a samurai, bored on a <b>hot</b> <b>summer</b> <b>day,</b> threw plant material into the small opening of a tall, deep vase on the opposite corner of the room. Thus this style was named Nageire. This Ikebana form utilizes fresh and spontaneous designs that adhere only loosely to the classical principles of triangular structure and color harmony. Therefore, Nageire is less formal than Rikka, which was developing around the same time. Nageire was also practiced and around the time that Chabana and Shoka were developing.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{though the}} Cessna 206H is {{certified}} as a six-seat aircraft in its country of origin, the Canadian aviation regulator, Transport Canada has certified it to carry only five people in Canada. [...] This {{is due to}} concerns about passenger egress through the rear clamshell door with the flaps extended. [...] Cessna addressed one part of this problem early on, after a flight-test aircraft was damaged when the pilot extended the flaps while taxiing, and his passenger had the clamshell door open (for ventilation; it was a <b>hot</b> <b>summer</b> <b>day).</b> [...] A switch {{was added to the}} flap actuation circuit which disabled the flaps when the doors were open. [...] The other {{part of the problem is}} that if the flaps are already down, the passenger must perform the complicated procedure of opening the front part as far as possible (about [...] ) then open the rear door and restow the rear door handle. This then gives enough clearance to open the rear part of the door.|$|E

Mélisande lies down on the marble rim of the well and tries to see to the bottom. Her hair loosens and falls into the water. Pelléas notices how extraordinarily long it is. He remembers that Golaud first met Mélisande beside a spring and asks if he tried to kiss her at that time but she does not answer. Mélisande plays with the ring Golaud gave her, throwing it up into the air until it slips from her fingers into the well. Pelléas tells her not to be concerned but she is not reassured. He also notes that the clock was striking twelve as the ring dropped into the well. Mélisande asks him what she should tell Golaud. He replies, [...] "the truth." ...|$|E
