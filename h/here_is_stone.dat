50|$|The railway {{revolution}} substantially {{reduced the}} {{traffic on the}} rivers and canals, but at Weston there was an extended life. The mill at King's Mill was a useful source of power and was relatively close to the gypsum quarries at Chellaston and Aston on Trent. Because of this a circuitous route was devised that must have involved considerable effort. The <b>stone</b> once quarried <b>was</b> loaded onto a purpose built tramway so that the <b>stone</b> could <b>be</b> pulled to the canal near Aston. From <b>here</b> the <b>stone</b> <b>was</b> loaded into canal barges and moved the short distance to Weston Cliff where it was again unloaded and craned onto river barges that took the stone again on the short trip to King's Mill. <b>Here</b> the <b>stone</b> <b>was</b> again unloaded, ground into plaster and then sent back by the same circuitous route via the river barges to Weston Cliff and then the product was taken to Pegg's works on the canal at Derby. There was a £400 pound a year charge for {{the power of the}} mill, but the rest of this effort was achieved with animal and human effort.|$|R

6000|$|Opposite {{the most}} {{prominent}} of these spurs the river (16,800 feet above the sea) runs west, forming marshes, which were full of Zannichellia palustris and Ranunculus aquatilis, both English and Siberian plants: the waters contained many shells, of a species of Lymnaea;* [This is the most alpine living shell in the world; my specimens being from nearly 17,000 feet elevation; it is the Lymnaea Hookeri, Reeve ("Proceedings of the Zoological Society," [...] No. 204).] and the soil near the edge, which was covered with tufts of short grass, was whitened with effloresced carbonate of soda. <b>Here</b> <b>were</b> some square <b>stone</b> enclosures two feet high, used as pens, and for pitching tents in; within them I gathered some unripe barley.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{differential}} {{feature of}} this work {{was the use of}} a type of glass that is little used as fine aggregate in concrete – flat glass powder. This study involved an analysis of the influence of the incorporation of waste glass from the grinding and polishing operations of the glass heat treatment process on the void content, water absorption (W/A) and specific gravity of Portland cement concrete. The coarse and fine aggregates used <b>here</b> <b>were</b> crushed <b>stone</b> and sand, respectively. The concrete was produced using 5 %, 10 % and 20 % of waste glass in place of sand, and water-to-cement (w/c) ratios of 0. 50, 0. 55 and 0. 58. The test specimens were cured for 28 days. The results indicated a reduction in the void content when the percentage of waste glass increased to w/c ratios of 0. 55 and 0. 58. The reduction of the void content reduced the concrete’s W/A and increased its specific gravity. The waste glass used in this study shows a promising potential for use as fine aggregate in Portland cement concrete. However, other variables must be taken into consideration in the subsequent publications...|$|R
