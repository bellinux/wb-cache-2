40|$|Many {{commercial}} buildings, including data centers, {{hotels and}} hospitals, have a simultaneous {{heating and cooling}} demand depending on the season, occupation and auxiliary equipment.

The electrical equipment in data centers produce heat, which must be removed to prevent the <b>equipment</b> <b>temperature</b> from rising to a certain level.

System simulations are carried out to determine the feasibility of the system for a 12 -month period. In addition, energy, environmental and economic analyses are carried out to show the benefits of this alternative technology when compared to the conventional system currently installed in the facility. Primary energy savings of ~ 28 % to ~ 61 %, a payback period of 3 to 4. 5 years and a decrease in the environmental impact value by ~ 36 % makes this system an attractive option.

40|$|SLR 2000 is {{a system}} concept for an autonomous, {{unmanned}} satellite laser ranging station with a single shot range precision of one centimeter or better. The goal {{of the program is}} to provide 24 hour tracking coverage and to reduce both capitalization and operating and maintenance costs by an order of magnitude relative to current outlays. The dominant cost driver in present systems is the onsite manpower required to operate the system, to service and maintain the complex subsystems (most notably the laser), and to ensure that the transmitted laser beam is not a hazard to onsite personnel or overflying aircraft. In performing initial tradeoff studies of the SLR 2000 system, preference was given to simple hardware over complex and to passive techniques over active resulting in the concept described here. The SLR 2000 system consists of an optical head mounted to a concrete pier which in turn contains a single rack of electronic <b>equipment.</b> <b>Temperature</b> inside the pier and instrument is controlled by a small heat pump.

40|$|Cloud {{providers}} {{have made}} significant strides {{in reducing the}} cooling capital and operational costs of their datacenters, for example, by leveraging outside air (“free”) cooling where possible. Despite these advances, cooling costs still repre-sent a significant expense mainly because cloud providers typically provision their cooling infrastructure for the worst-case scenario (i. e., very high load and outside temperature at the same time). Thus, in this paper, we propose to reduce cooling costs by underprovisioning the cooling infrastruc-ture. When the cooling is underprovisioned, there might be (rare) periods when the cooling infrastructure cannot cool down the IT equipment enough. During these periods, we can either (1) reduce the processing capacity and potentially degrade the quality of service, or (2) let the IT <b>equipment</b> <b>temperature</b> increase {{in exchange for a}} controlled degra-dation in reliability. To determine the ideal amount of un-derprovisioning, we introduce CoolProvision, an optimiza-tion and simulation framework for selecting the cheapest provisioning within performance constraints defined by the provider. CoolProvision leverages an abstract trace of the ex-pected workload, as well as cooling, performance, power, reliability, and cost models to explore the space of potential provisionings. Using data from a real small free-cooled data-center, our results suggest that CoolProvision can reduce the cost of cooling by up to 55 %. We extrapolate our experience and results to larger cloud datacenters as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{is to examine the}} impact that common installation practices and age-induced equipment degradation may have on the installed performance of natural gas furnaces, as measured by steady-state efficiency and AFUE. PARR identified twelve furnaces of various ages and efficiencies that were operating in residential homes in the Des Moines Iowa metropolitan area and worked with a local HVAC contractor to retrieve them and test them for steady-state efficiency and AFUE in the lab. Prior to removal, system airflow, static pressure, <b>equipment</b> <b>temperature</b> rise, and flue loss measurements were recorded for each furnace. After removal from the field the furnaces were transported to the Gas Technology Institute (GTI) laboratory, where PARR conducted steady-state efficiency and AFUE testing. The test results show that steady-state efficiency in the field was 6. 4 % lower than that measured for the same furnaces under standard conditions in the lab, which included tuning the furnace input and air flow rate. Comparing AFUE measured under ASHRAE standard conditions with the label value shows no reduction in efficiency for the furnaces in this study over their 15 to 24 years of operation when tuned to standard conditions. Further analysis of the data showed no significant correlation between efficiency change and the age or the rated efficiency of the furnace...|$|E
