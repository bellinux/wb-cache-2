The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of two different vaccination strategies in a specialized <b>fattening</b> <b>herd</b> affected by actinobacillosis. Methods The study was conducted in a specialized <b>fattening</b> <b>herd</b> employing age segregated rearing in eight units. The herd suffered from infections caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 2, confirmed by necropsy and serology. The study included 54 batches of pigs grouped into five periods. Batches of pigs of the second period were vaccinated against actinobacillosis twice, and pigs in the fourth period were vaccinated three times. Batches of pigs of the first, third and fifth period were not vaccinated. Concentrations of serum antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae and serum amyloid A (SAA) were analysed and production data were recorded. Results Despite vaccinating, medical treatments were required to reduce the impact of the disease. The mean incidence of individual treatments for respiratory diseases during the rearing period ranged from 0 to 4. 7 ± 1. 8 %, and was greatest during the triple vaccination period (period IV; p A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 2 {{in the absence of a}} SAA-response. The {{prevalence of}} pleuritis decreased from 25. 4 ± 6. 5 % in the first period to 5. 0 ± 3. 7 % in the fifth period (p Conclusions The vaccine did not effectively prevent clinical expression of A. pleuropneumoniae infections, but seroconversion to A. pleuropneumoniae in the absence of a SAA-response in a large number pigs indicated that the vaccine had activated the immune system. Further, the prevalence of pleuritis decreased with time. This indicates that vaccinations together with intensified medical treatments of affected pigs could be useful in reducing the impact of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 2 infections. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} use of PCR to detect DNA from Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, the {{etiological}} agent of enzootic porcine pneumonia. A primer set was designed for the amplification of a 649 -bp fragment of the 16 S rRNA gene from M hyopneumoniae. The PCR product was identified by ethidium bromide staining after gel electrophoresis and by Southern hybridization with an M. hyopneumoniae-specific oligonucleotide probe. No amplification was observed from any other porcine bacteria tested, including several closely related mycoplasmas. It was also possible to demonstrate the presence of M. hyopneumoniae in bronchial lavage samples and lung tissue samples from experimentally infected pigs. Furthermore, the PCR system was used for analysis of nasal samples obtained from pigs in a <b>fattening</b> <b>herd.</b> By this method, {{we were able to}} detect M. hyopneumoniae in nose swabs from naturally infected pigs.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the metabolic profile of cattle fed with or without zearalenone (ZEN) and sterigmatocystin (STC) -contaminated diets using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics approach. Urinary samples were collected from individual animals (n = 6 per herd) from fattening female Japanese Black (JB) cattle herds (23 months old, 550 – 600 kg). Herd 1 had persistently high urinary ZEN and STC concentrations due to the presence of contaminated rice straw. Herd 2, the second female JB <b>fattening</b> <b>herd</b> (23 months old, 550 – 600 kg), received the same dietary feed as Herd 1, with non-contaminated rice straw. Urine samples were collected from Herd 1, two weeks after the contaminated rice straw was replaced with uncontaminated rice straw (Herd 1 N). Identified metabolites were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and ANOVA. The PCA revealed that the effects on cattle metabolites depended on ZEN and STC concentrations. The contamination of cattle feed with multiple mycotoxins may alter systemic metabolic processes, including metabolites associated with ATP generation, amino acids, glycine-conjugates, organic acids, and purine bases. The results obtained from Herd 1 N indicate that a two-week remedy period was not sufficient to improve the levels of urinary metabolites, suggesting that chronic contamination with mycotoxins may have long-term harmful effects on the systemic metabolism of cattle...|$|E
40|$|Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is a {{major cause}} of {{respiratory}} disease in pigs, causing animal suffering and substantial economic losses. The aim of this thesis was to obtain more knowledge on the protective immunity to infections with A. pleuropneumoniae and to evaluate potential strategies in preventing and combating A. pleuropneumoniae infections. Investigations regarding the role of maternal immunity {{for the protection of the}} offspring and the subsequent effect on the epidemiology on herd level demonstrated that the levels of serum antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae in sows were reflected in colostral levels. The colostral levels were in turn reflected in the levels of serum antibodies in the offspring and piglets with high levels of antibodies also had detectable levels of antibodies for a longer time compared to the offspring to sows with low levels of antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae. An inoculation of naïve pigs with A. pleuropneumoniae induced acute-phase protein responses. The response to the inoculation was clearly affected by the antimicrobial treatment administered at the onset of clinical signs of respiratory disease. The response of these pigs to a second inoculation was also influenced by the treatments carried out after the first inoculation. Enrofloxacin was superior in reducing clinical signs but left pigs unprotected at the second inoculation. Tetracycline demonstrated a similar treatment efficacy as enrofloxacin but pigs were protected at challenge as were the penicillin treated pigs. Penicillin was on the other hand not efficient in curing diseased pigs. The pigs that were protected from disease at the second inoculation had all developed serum antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae following the first inoculation and an acute-phase response was not induced following the second inoculation. The results therefore indicate that antibodies mirror protection against disease well. Vaccinations against actinobacillosis in a <b>fattening</b> <b>herd</b> did not provide protection against clinical disease. However, in combination with intensified treatments of pigs with signs of respiratory disease, pleurisy registrations at slaughter decreased over time although the growth rate was unaffected...|$|E

Ten groups of pigs with acute respiratory disease {{during the months}} September to October 1991 and seven groups of pigs with acute diarrhoea during the months February to March 1992 were investigated. On arrival in the <b>fattening</b> <b>herds,</b> more of the pigs were negative for antibodies against H 1 N 1 -influenza virus and against PRCV during September to October (61 and 50 per cent, respectively) than in February to March (51 and 33 per cent, respectively).

40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) as an infectious agent for humans {{has increased in}} recent years in Germany. Although {{it is well known that}} the prevalence of MRSA in pig farms is high, risk factors for the presence of MRSA in <b>herds</b> of <b>fattening</b> pigs are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate available data from previous studies on MRSA in fattening pigs in a meta-analysis to answer the question: What are the factors associated with the occurrence of MRSA in fattening pig herds?The studies on MRSA in pigs that were identified by literature research were heterogeneous with respect to the risk factors investigated and the type of herds focused on. Therefore we decided to carry out a pooling analysis on herd level rather than a typical meta-analysis. Eligible herd data were identified based on the published literature and communication with the authors. The final data set covered 400 <b>fattening</b> pig <b>herds</b> from 10 different studies and 12 risk factors. The prevalence of MRSA in the 400 <b>fattening</b> pig <b>herds</b> was 53. 5 %. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). The resulting multivariate model confirmed previously identified risk factors for MRSA in pig herds (herd size and herd type). It also identified further risk factors: group treatment of fattening pigs with antimicrobial drugs (OR= 1. 79) and housing <b>fattening</b> pig <b>herds</b> on at least partially slatted floors (OR= 2. 39) compared to plain floor. In contrast, according to the model, <b>fattening</b> pig <b>herds</b> on farms keeping other livestock along with pigs were less likely to harbor MRSA (OR= 0. 54).

40|$|With {{large sums}} of capital {{invested}} in fattening and breeding facilities, coupled with the uncertainty of pigmeat prices, the survey has confirmed that the modern pig farmer must maintain high levels of efficiency. The key factors to profitability are:- 1. Pigs produced per sow per year. This will depend both on the number raised per litter {{and the number of}} litters per sow per year. These are largely factors of management – ensuring sows are mated at the correct time, providing optimum farrowing facilities and keeping sow and piglet health at a high level. 2. Quantity of food for breeding stock. The amount of food will influence both the type and number of weaners. Analysis of the survey results shows that higher meal supplementation alone will increase the number of piglets per litter. The cost of this though may not be justified in itself and improved sow management may give a greater financial return. Individual sow feeders will decrease the use of meal by controlling sow intake to her requirement yet will not decrease efficiency. The decrease in meal cost can be quite significant and hence will reduce the direct cost of the weaner. 3. Efficiency of fattening stock. The type of weaner produced by the breeding herd has the largest bearing on the efficiency of food conversion and rate of growth in the <b>fattening</b> <b>herd.</b> Although the effect of housing and disease is not so great (except in the extremes) they can also increase the profitability of the unit quite substantially especially when the food cost is so high. 4. Cost of food. A comparison of extensive and intensive systems is outside the scope of this survey and indeed difficult at any time especially when one involves appreciating capital and the other depreciating capital. The farmer who has the lower cost structure and maintains stock performance can best cope with the unstable market. This does not mean that increased performance associated with a higher feed cost is not justified economically. Profits in pig production depend very much on efficiency levels. Farmers should keep records of stock performance and feed costs. They are simple to record and will at least provide some guide to assess efficiency...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{effects of}} farming practice scenarios aiming to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and subsequent alternative land use on {{environmental impacts of}} a beef cattle production system using the life cycle assessment approach. The baseline scenario includes a standard cow-calf herd with finishing heifers based on grazing, and a standard bull-fattening herd using a diet mainly based on maize silage, corresponding to current farm characteristics and management by beef farmers in France. Alternative scenarios were developed with changes in farming practices. Some scenarios modified grassland management (S 1 : decreasing mineral N fertiliser on permanent grassland; S 2 : decreasing grass losses during grazing) or herd management (S 3 : underfeeding of heifers in winter; S 4 : fattening female calves instead of being reared at a moderate growth rate; S 5 : increasing longevity of cows from 7 to 9 years; S 6 : advancing first calving age from 3 to 2 years). Other scenarios replaced protein sources (S 7 : partially replacing a protein supplement by lucerne hay for the cow-calf herd; S 8 : replacing soya bean meal with rapeseed meal for the <b>fattening</b> <b>herd)</b> or increased n- 3 fatty acid content using extruded linseed (S 9). The combination of compatible scenarios S 1, S 2, S 5, S 6 and S 8 was also studied (S 10). The impacts, such as climate change (CC, not including CO 2 emissions/sequestration of land use and land-use change, LULUC), CC/LULUC (including CO 2 emissions of LULUC), cumulative energy demand, eutrophication (EP), acidification and land occupation (LO) were expressed per kg of carcass mass and per ha of land occupied. Compared with the baseline, the most promising practice to reduce impacts per kg carcass mass was S 10 (all reduced by 13 % to 28 %), followed by S 6 (by 8 % to 10 %). For other scenarios, impact reduction did not exceed 5 %, except for EP (up to 11 %) and LO (up to 10 %). Effects of changes in farming practices (the scenarios) on environmental impacts varied according to impact category and functional unit. For some scenarios (S 2, S 4, S 6 and S 10), permanent grassland area and LO per kg of carcass decreased by 12 % to 23 % and 9 % to 19 %, respectively. If the 'excess' permanent grassland was converted to fast-growing conifer forest to sequester carbon in tree and soil biomass, CC/LULUC per kg of carcass could be reduced by 20 %, 25 %, 27 % and 48 % for scenarios S 2, S 4, S 6 and S 10, respectively. These results illustrate the potential of farming practices and forest as an alternative land use to contribute to short-and mid-term GHG mitigation of beef cattle production systems...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this field}} study was to compare in two APP-problem herds the {{efficiency}} and profitability of a single-dose -injection of Tulathromycin with the usual feed medication of Amoxicillin resp. Tetracycline for metaphylaxis after weaning resp. starting fattening. The clinical trial was conducted from October 2007 to May 2008 in a farrow to wean herd (two series of 686 weaned piglets) and in an independent <b>fattening</b> <b>herd</b> (one series of 603 pigs), both with the repeated occurrence of acute Pleuropneumonia by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP). After weaning resp. herd addition for fattening pigs were separated to different pens or stable rows for alternative metaphylaxis of Tulathromycin by a single i. m. -injection or of Amoxicillin-Trihydrat (weaned piglets) resp. of Tetracycline-HCL (fattening pigs) by oral feed medication of 7 days {{on the basis of}} preceding resistograms. With consideration for the farm owners only every 6 th or 10 th pig served as a non treated control (risk of losses). For space and feeding reasons (oral medications) these controls had to be housed in the same pens as the Tulathromycin medicated pigs. Objectives of this trial were kind and frequency of diseases and losses, growing performance (daily weight gain) and frequency of unsaleable pigs at delivery for fattening resp. slaughtering, as well as costs for drug treatments during the total growing period and for the growing delay. In addition, a sample of 280 weaned pigs was bleeded four times until delivery in order to control associations of C-Reactive-Proteine (CRP) and herd health resp. efficiency of metaphylaxis. Respiratory diseases and losses did not occur during their effective period. Afterwards the incidence of sporadically diseased pigs with different symptoms varied over time between 0 % an 19 % in weaned pigs resp. 1. 5 % and 6 % in fattening pigs without significant group differences. Losses in weaned pigs ranged from 0 to 5. 1 % and in fattening pigs significantly (p< 0. 05) from 1. 2 % resp. 1. 6 % (metaphylactic treatments) and 9. 3 % (untreated controls). At {{the end of the first}} weaner series, in the 7 th week, only the Amoxicillin-group was affected by an acute APP-infection with 93. 5 % of diseased pigs. CRP-serum values of the first weaner series with an acute APP-outbreak differed extremely between groups and dates, particularly between first and follow up dates. Consecutive studies should clarify, if high values, as observed in our study and in contrast to others, are associated with a powerful immunity resp. with an efficient metaphylaxis (Tulathromycingroup), and if low values indicate the onset of the incubation of an infectious disease (Amoxicillin-group). In the first series of weaned pigs daily weight gains were significantly higher in the Tulathromycin-treated group (p< 0, 05) than in the APP-diseased Amoxicillin-group (0, 433 kg vs. 0, 388 kg) but not in the control group. In the second series of weaners and in fattening pigs groups did not differ in the growing performance. Due to the APP-infection in the first series of weaners, the rate of unsaleable pigs at delivery was significantly higher (p< 0, 001) in the Amoxicillin-group (24, 9 %) as compared to the Tulathromycin-group (5, 9 %) and the untreated controls (10, 9 %). Costs for metaphylaxis and additional medications per pig over time (drugs and treatments by stock´s person), and daily costs per unsaleable pigs after delivery were in case of the APP-infection much lower with Tulathromycin than with Amoxicillin as a metaphylaxis. In the second series of weaners and in fattenting pigs, each without APP-infection, oral Amoxicillinresp. Tetracycline-metaphylaxis was less expensive in total than the Tulathromycinmetaphylaxis by single dose injection. This is mainly due to higher drug volumes and working expenditure for the i. m. application. Further studies under field conditions should prove if total costs of Tulathromycin-metaphylaxis in case of extremely exposed APP-fattening herds may adjust or even reverse these costs. The good health and growing performance of non treated controls which were housed commonly with the Tulathromycin treated pigs might be the result of the antimicrobial caused decrease in germ pressure and its consecutive lower risk of infection. With reservation of the specific herd situations in this field study we conclude that in extremely APP-exposed weaned piglets the parenteral metaphylaxis of Tulathromycin with a single i. m. injection might be more efficient and less expensive during the growing period than oral medication of Amoxicillin over 7 days...|$|E

Data originated from 2806 batches (a group of stock calves homogeneous for GT, ori- gin, finishing <b>herd,</b> <b>fattening</b> period, and diets), and concerned 188, 891 animals of 10 GT herded in 44 farms of the Veneto region. For each batch, average body weight (BW) at arrival and at sale, duration of the fattening period, losses due to injury or death, purchase and sell price were collected, and average daily gain (ADG) and net sale gain (NSG) per head, per day of fat- tening, and per kg of BW gain were computed. Charolais and Limousine young bulls accounted for nearly 50 % and 20 %, respectively, of all ani- mals, and over 90 % of calves originated from France.

40|$|During {{a period}} of {{one and a half}} year, 384 feed samples and 330 serum samples were {{analysed}} for ochratoxin A. In the same time, 391 feed samples and 234 serum samples were analysed for zearalenone. On average, 17, 7  % (n= 68) of the feed samples and 55, 2  % (n= 182) of the serum samples were ochratoxin A positiv. Zearalenone was found in 74, 4  % (n= 291) of the feed samples and in 6, 0  % (n= 14) of the serum samples. Those results showed that an individual determination of the recovery rate for each feed sample is very important for the real value. If ochratoxin A was traced in the feed, it can also be found in the sera of pigs fed with this feed. Due to the different detectibility limits with 0, 1  ppb in sera and 1  ppb in feed, even smallest amounts can be analysed in the blood serum. If zearalenone intoxication is suspected, the feedstuff analysis is to prefer because the half time period of zearalenone in blood is very short. In this study different influences on the intoxication levels could be shown: Seasonality: The frequency of intoxication increases with the time of feed storage. Because of the varing climatic circumstances, the values differ from year to year. Farm type: More frequently, the serum samples of <b>fattening</b> <b>herds</b> were more often ochratoxin A positiv than the samples of sow herds. Zearalenone was found more frequently in feed of <b>fattening</b> <b>herds</b> than in sow herds. Storing type: Compared to indoor silo or storage on the floor, the ochratoxin A contamination of the feed in outdoor silos was lower. The highest ochratoxin A-contamination rate was found by storage in sacks or on the floor. The highest zearalenone contamination rate was found in feed stored in outdoor silo. Feedstuff derivation: In comparison to pigs which got home mixed feed, pigs supplied with purchased feed showed serologically more ochratoxin A positiv results. There was no different in the zearalenone contamination of purchased feed and home mixed feed. Straw bedding: The analysis of straw often showed high values of both mycotoxins. Therefore, an analysis of the straw seams to be necessary if an intoxication with mycotoxins is suspected. This study demonstrates that samples accidentially taken for the field study are more frequently ochratoxin A contaminated than toxin-suspected samples. It showed further more, that in toxin-suspected feed samples zearalenone was more frequently detected than in the samples of the field study. The results demonstrate, that the clinical diagnosis of an ochratoxin A intoxication is more difficult than the diagnosis of the zearalenone syndrome...|$|R

The performances of the serological method were evaluated by choosing microbiological method as reference. Correlations were practiced by comparing results of optical densities of samples with cut-off values corresponding to 4 different antibody concentrations. Forty-eight different possibilities have thus been created depending on the percentage of positive samples above the cut-off value and in function of arithmetic and geometric means. The results have shown that negative predictive values ranged from 52. 8 and 100 % and that the relative sensitivity varied between 4. 5 and 100 %. One classification model appeared better than the others due to maximization of Kappa, negative predictive and relative sensitivity values: batch considered positive when at least 50 % of samples were characterized by an optical density higher than OD 20 % (optical density corresponding to an antibody concentration of 20 %). The present experiment showed the importance of good classification of individual serological results in order to strengthen the on-farm bacteriological surveillance of herds. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{continuing}} {{expansion of}} high incidence areas of bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) in Great Britain (GB) raises {{a number of}} questions concerning the determinants of infection at the herd level that are driving spread of the disease. Here, we develop risk factor models to quantify the importance of herd sizes, cattle imports from Ireland, history of bTB, badgers and cattle restocking in determining bTB incidence. We compare the significance of these different risk factors in high and low incidence areas (as determined by parish testing intervals). Results Large <b>herds</b> and <b>fattening</b> <b>herds</b> are more likely to breakdown in all areas. In areas with lower perceived risk (longer testing intervals), the risk of breaking down is largely determined by the number of animals that a herd buys in from high incidence areas. In contrast, in higher perceived risk areas (shorter testing intervals), the risk of breakdown is defined by the history of disease and the probability of badger occurrence. Despite differences in the management of bTB across different countries of GB (England, Wales and Scotland), we found no significant differences in bTB risk at the national level after these other factors had been taken into account. Conclusions This paper demonstrates that different types of farm are at risk of breakdown and that the most important risk factors vary according to bTB incidence in an area. The results suggest that significant gains in bTB control could be made by targeting herds in low incidence areas that import the greatest number of cattle from high incidence areas. </p...|$|R

40|$|Campylobacter spp., Salmonella enterica, and Yersinia enterocolitica {{are common}} causes of {{foodborne}} infections in humans with pork {{as a potential}} source. Monitoring programs at farm level are, to date, only implemented for S. enterica, while epidemiological knowledge {{of the other two}} pathogens is still lacking. This study aimed to assess the pathogen load (in the pigs' environment) in <b>fattening</b> pig <b>herds,</b> their simultaneous occurrence, and the occurrence of Campylobacter spp. and Y. enterocolitica in herds in different Salmonella risk categories. In 50 <b>fattening</b> pig <b>herds</b> in northern Germany, four pooled fecal samples and 10 swab samples from the pigs' direct environment (pen walls, nipple drinkers), indirect environment (hallways, drive boards), and flies and rodent droppings were collected from each herd and submitted for cultural examination. Campylobacter spp. were detected in 38. 1 % of fecal, 32. 7 % of direct environment, 5. 3 % of indirect environment, and 4. 6 % of flies/pests samples collected, and Y. enterocolitica in 17. 1, 8. 1, 1. 2, and 3. 1 % and S. enterica in 11. 2, 7. 7, 4. 1, and 1. 5 %, respectively. For Campylobacter spp., Y. enterocolitica, and S. enterica, 80, 48, and 32 % of herds were positive, respectively; 22 herds were positive for both Campylobacter spp. and Y. enterocolitica, 12 for Campylobacter spp. and S. enterica, and 7 for Y. enterocolitica and S. enterica. There was no significant association between the pathogens at herd level. Campylobacter spp. and Y. enterocolitica were found more often in samples from the low Salmonella risk category (odds ratio, 0. 51; confidence interval, 0. 36 to 0. 73, and 0. 3, 0. 17 to 0. 57), and this was also the case for Y. enterocolitica at herd level (odds ratio, 0. 08; confidence interval, 0. 02 to 0. 3). This study provides evidence that the pigs' environment should be accounted for when implementing control measures on farms against Campylobacter spp. and Y. enterocolitica. An extrapolation from the current Salmonella monitoring to the other two pathogens does not seem feasible...|$|R
40|$|In Italy {{nearly two}} thirds of the beef bulls are reared in {{northern}} regions by specialized intensive fatteners that import stock calves from other European countries, mainly from France. Usually they feed them until slaughter with total mixed rations based on maize silage and concentrates. The increase of feed and animal purchase costs, the growing requirements for environmental sustainability and the expected detrimental changes in Common Agricultural Policy for intensive systems are currently endangering the viability of this sector. This study aimed to analyse the effects of management factors such as beef breed, body weight (BW) at arrival and diets on performance traits, nutrient excretion and net sale gain (NSG), taken as economic indicator, computed as (beef value at sale – beef value at purchase) and expressed per day of fattening (€/d). Seventeen specialized <b>fattening</b> <b>herds</b> were visited monthly during 1 year to collect performance data and diets formulation and composition. The data were analyzed using ANOVA with herd, breed and classes of management factors as fixed effects. The fattening period for beef cattle lasted on average 229 d, with an average BW at purchase and at sale of 370 and 671 kg, respectively. The average NSG computed per day of fattening was 2. 44 €/d, with a large variation due to herd and breed. Feed intake averaged 9. 75 kg DM, and the average gain to feed ratio was 7. 5. Diets were characterised by an average crude protein and phosphorus content of 141 g/kg DM and 3. 78 g/kg DM, respectively, the ratio between NSC and NDF averaged 1. 4, and average self-sufficiency was 33 % on daily DM intake. During the production cycle the intake, the retention and excretion of nitrogen averaged 0. 22, 0. 04 and 0. 18 kg/d, respectively, and those of phosphorous averaged 0. 04, 0. 01 and 0. 03 kg/d, respectively.

40|$|Livestock {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an important contributor to environmental impact of human activity. The beef sector of Veneto Region (Italy) represents a main player in the national beef production, but knowledge on its overall impact lacks. This study aimed to survey the environmental footprint of intensive beef sector in Veneto Region through a gate-to-gate Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. The study considered 1 kg of body weight (BW) as functional unit and the batch (a group of animals homogenous for breed, diet, fattening period, and finishing herd) as system boundary. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission (kgCO 2 -eq), acidification (gSO 2 -eq) and eutrophication (gPO 4 -eq) were taken as impact categories. The study involved 328 batches and 16 specialized beef <b>fattening</b> <b>herds.</b> Information about breed (mainly Charolaise, Limousine and French and Irish crosses), sex, fattening period (226 ± 17 d), initial and final BW (365 ± 47, 686 ± 82 kg, respectively), composition of Total Mixed Ration (TMR), dry matter intake (10. 2 ± 1. 2 kg DM/d) and growth rate (1. 43 ± 0. 20 kg/d) were recorded or computed for each batch. Data on materials used (plastic, fuel, electricity), and dedicated-to-feed-herd crop production were collected for the year 2013 in each herd. Off-farm emissions have been acquired from literature data and software (Simapro 7. 3. 3 – Ecoinvent database v. 2. 2). Different methods {{were used to assess}} the impact categories resulting in a range of possible values. The impact on GHG emissions category ranged from 7. 3 ± 1. 2 to 8. 7 ± 1. 4 kg CO 2 eq/kg BW, on acidification was 206 ± 52 g SO 2 eq/kg BW, while on eutrophication 41. 2 ± 10. 5 g PO 4 eq/kg BW. Impact categories were analysed according to a mixed model with breed, arrival season and BW, neutral detergent fibre (NDF), and average daily gain (ADG) classes (calculated as mean± 0. 5 SD within each breed) as fixed effects and herd as random effect. Breed, ADG and NDF classes influenced (P< 0. 01) all impact categories, while arrival season influenced only GHG emission and eutrophication categories. The environmental footprint of this specialized system seems lower than values reported for other beef fattening systems. However, high variation was observed among estimates obtained using different methods, suggesting the need to standardize the approaches used for LCA analysis. Moreover, {{further research is needed to}} extend the system boundary for including the production of stock calves in the country of origin...|$|R

40|$|Salmonella in {{pigs and}} derived pork is a {{significant}} food safety concern in Ireland. During commercial pig production, it is proposed {{that a number of}} risk factors including commercial feed can introduce Salmonella to <b>fattening</b> pig <b>herds</b> and may thereby cause human infections via consumption of contaminated pork. The objective of this work was to carry out an in-depth study on ten high Salmonella sero-prevalence pig farms to firstly identify which production stages were the principal harbours of Salmonella infection and secondly, to assess the occurrence of Salmonella in feed throughout the different production stages on these farms and thereby assess potential risks as well as epidemiological relationships. Isolates were characterized by serotyping, antibiotic resistance profiling, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multiple locus VNTR analysis (MLVA). Eleven serotypes were recovered, with a monophasic variant of Typhimurium (4,[5], 12 :i:) accounting for 41. 1 % of all isolates recovered. Five Salmonella 4,[5], 12 :i:- isolates were recovered from the commercial feed mills supplying our pig farms. Typing of all isolates resulted in two common distinct MLVA profiles for both mills and farms. The Salmonella 4,[5], 12 :i:- variant that predominated in the pigs and feed is an emerging strain in Europe and are of increasing food safety concern. The objective of the final {{study was to determine the}} survival characteristics of Salmonella 4,[5], 12 :i:- strains. The thermal inactivation of the five feed strains at 55, 60 and 65 °C was investigated using an immersed heating coil apparatus. The ability of the five strains to survive during storage on weaner pig feed premixed with Sodium Butyrate was also assessed over 28 day storage. The key findings in this study is the confirmation of monophasic Salmonella Typhimurium occurrence in new geographical settings and the indication of its possible role in the transmission of Salmonella from contaminated feed ingredients and feed to pigs...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} gather further information about the sources of infection with Campylobacter spp. and their qualitative and quantitative importance in pig production. For statistical analysis, 1, 040 results from the bacteriological examination for Campylobacter spp. were evaluated with questionnaires from four farrowing and twelve fattening units. The prevalence was determined via faeces and swab samples with regard to certain farm production parameters. Thereby 30. 8 % of the sows and 80. 9 % of their piglets were carriers of Campylobacter spp [...] In the fattening unit, the prevalence at the beginning of the fattening period was 89. 2 % and at the end 64. 7 %. As a result of the small sample size in the farrowing unit it was not possible to perform a risk analysis which yielded significant conclusions. In the fattening stage, the following risk factors had a significant effect (p≤ 0. 05) on Campylobacter spp. prevalence: sampling time, number of <b>fattening</b> places per <b>herd,</b> mixed farming, floor space design, feed origin, antibacterial and anthelmintic treatment.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} fatty acid composition in meat of Cika and Simmental bulls from two different <b>fattening</b> technologies. The <b>herd</b> of 39 young bulls was housed during the winter time and fed the same total mixed ration diet (TMR) based on corn and grass silage with a limited amount of concentrates. In the spring bulls of both breeds were divided into two subgroups. Bulls in the first subgroup (10 Cika, 9 Simmental; S-INT) were fattened indoors with the semi-intensive TMR. Bulls in the second subgroup (10 Cika, 10 Simmental; G+S-INT) were put on all-day grazing in the pasture. After grazing period bulls were housed under the same conditions as the first subgroup. Samples of M. longissimus dorsi were collected from the right carcass side to determine the total fat content and the fatty acid composition. The breed significantly influenced fatty acid composition in meat. The beef of Simmental bulls resulted in higher percentage of PUFA and lower percentage of SFA and MUFA. Higher percentage of n- 3 and n- 6 PUFA was determined in meat of Simmental bulls but the n- 6 /n- 3 ratio was lower in Cika bulls meat. The fattening technology had less effect on FA composition in meat.

Aim {{of the study was}} to investi-gate management and investment costs of runs on German farms. 20 pig farms of a special brand for animal friendly husbandry were investigated with a questionnaire and more detailed investigations were carried out on 10 farms. Furthermore, data were evaluated from a questionnaire of ca. 800 organic cattle farms and from farm visits of ca. 100 farms. Cattle: Nearly half of organic dairy farms had access to outdoor runs. However, the percentage was lower in stanchion barns than in loose housing systems. Furthermore, the percentage was lower for young stock, fattening bulls or calves. Outdoor runs were normally not covered. All runs were paved (normally with concrete). Runs were cleaned 3 – 7 times a week (normally by tractor). Slurry was produced in most cases because runs were not bedded. In many runs, elements like drinkers, roughage sup-ply, or cow brushes were available. Investment costs ranged between 250 and 300 € per cow. Pigs: Nearly half of organic pig farms have outdoor runs for fattening pigs. All runs of the brand program were bedded. This is less common in organic farms. Many runs were covered. Drinkers were available in all runs. Runs were cleaned 1 – 2 times a week by tractor. Calculated investment costs amounted to 130 and 190 € per <b>fattening</b> pig for <b>herd</b> sizes of 100 and 400 pigs.

50|$|Routine {{applications}} of anthelmintic drug seem {{to appeal to}} pig farmers for reasons of convenience (Nansen and Roepstorff, 1999). However, merely resorting to anthelmintic treatment could result in little or no improvement due to continuous reinfection. The use of anthelmintics therefore needs to be complemented by higher quality farm hygiene and more effective farm management practices if one strives to reduce the roundworm infection pressure on the farm.There are numerous aspects of farm management that can {{have a major impact}} on the epidemiology of A. suum. Undoubtedly, the type of production system, stable infrastructure and different management factors like the application of a quarantine for imported pigs, all-in-all-out practice, early weaning, and the efficiency of cleaning protocols will affect Ascaris epidemiology. The type of production system that is in use will be a key factor regarding the infection intensity on a farm (Nansen and Roepstorff, 1999). For obvious reasons, there is a higher diversity of parasite species and higher infection intensity on traditional farms and where pigs have access to outdoor facilities when compared to intensive indoor systems (Lai et al., 2011; Roepstorff and Nansen, 1994). Reducing contact of pigs with their own faecal deposits or from pigs from previous rounds is important. Consequentially, housing of pigs on slatted floors seems to reduce the chance of parasite infestation compared to solid or partially slatted floors (Roepstorff and Jorsal, 1990; Sanchez-Vazquez et al., 2010; Tielen et al., 1978). Increased risk is associated with bedding being present in the pens. The use of bedding material may provide extra refugia that promote egg embryonation and hamper the effectiveness of repeated cleaning and disinfection measures. Evidently, the stocking density in the pig house will also be important (Tielen et al., 1978), as chances of pens containing pigs with patent infections will increase. Positioning the water supply in the dung area instead of in the lying area or the feeding troughs seems to be associated with a decreased prevalence of A. suum (Roepstorff et al., 1999). Water spillage in areas where eggs are present will enhance the chances for survival of the eggs due to constant humidity. Despite the extremely rigid eggshell, eggs do not embryonate when relative humidity is low, for instance in the dry resting areas in pig pens, or when floor temperatures are lower than 15 °C. Additionally, pig urine also seems to exhibit a strong inhibitory effect on the development of A. suum eggs (Nilsson, 1982). Once in the environment, the eggs will embryonate until the infective larvae are present inside the egg. Only then, the egg is infective for a new host. In a Danish study it was shown that A. suum eggs could embryonate on a pasture within 4-6 weeks during a normal Danish summer (Roepstorff and Murrell, 1997). These results were supported by experiments in laboratory conditions, during which it was observed that, although motile larvae were noticed from 4 weeks post-incubation, an incubation period of at least 6 weeks at room temperature was needed for eggs to become infective in mice (Geenen et al., 1999). When environmental factors like temperature, oxygen availability and relative humidity are suboptimal, the time for larvae to become infective increases (Nilsson, 1982). This is reflected by the fact that white spot levels seem to vary within farms depending on the season. Presumably, the rising temperatures in spring and summer allow the eggs that have overwintered in the stables to massively develop into the infective larval stage, leading to heavier infective environments and subsequently higher liver condemnation rates in summer and early autumn (Lai et al., 2011; Menzies et al., 1994; Nilsson, 1982; Sanchez-Vazquez et al., 2012).In intensive indoor systems, the presence of a breeding stock on a farm seems to be associated with a lower chance of A. suum being present on the farm. More often than not, farmers are unaware of the parasite status of the pigs that are bought from external producers. Therefore, importing pigs from piglet producers evidently increases the risk of introducing new infections into the <b>herd.</b> Farmers with <b>fattening</b> <b>herds</b> are advised to buy piglets from larger piglet producers with good management and hygiene (Joachim et al., 2001b) and that were preferably treated prior to delivery. Whether weaners need to be treated at the beginning of fattening or not is open for discussion. However, if their worm-free status cannot be warranted, incoming pigs should be treated upon arrival, hereby reducing the risk of introducing the infection into their herd. Once A. suum is present on the farm, it is easily dispersed over the whole farm through moving animals and dirty materials and boots. Even flies have shown to carry A. suum eggs (Forster et al., 2009).Other management practices like the use of the all-in-all-out system, and early weaning are linked to lower prevalence of A. suum (Joachim et al., 2001b; Roepstorff and Jorsal, 1990; Roepstorff et al., 1999; Tielen et al., 1978). In the all-in-all-out production system, pigs are moved into and out of facilities in distinct groups with the hope that, by preventing the commingling of groups, the spread of disease is reduced. This practice also allows for a period of thorough cleaning and disinfecting between subsequent groups of animals. Early weaning of piglets (3-5 weeks) also seems to be associated with a reduced risk of A. suum infection (Roepstorff et al., 1999). However it is likely that this can be attributed to the fact that both these parameters are associated with other factors that are more important for parasite survival, like for instance, the use of more traditional rearing methods or poorer general pen hygiene.Frequent cleaning of the pens, preferably after each round, is indispensable to destroy or reduce the amount of eggs in the environment. Clearly, the presence of rough and uneven surfaces would provide a good microenvironment for egg development and have an impact on the efficiency of cleaning protocols. Joachim et al., (2001) indicated that in older pens, the prevalence of Ascaris infections was significantly higher (63,0%) than in the new pens (27,9%). Moreover, Nilsson (1982) found high number of eggs (up to 3,000 EPG) in the crevices of the floor between the slatted dung area and the resting area of the pen. Approximately half of these eggs appeared to be embryonated. In a study by Beloeil et al., (2003) 31% of the farms surveyed had residual dung in the fattening pens when restocking them with new fattening pigs, a practice, favouring the transmission of A. suum eggs. Even though careful cleaning of the pens with high-pressure water will remove most of the residual dung, it seems ineffective to completely remove all infective eggs (Nilsson, 1982). The use of disinfectants is very effective against bacteria, but is rather ineffective against A. suum eggs. Instead, steam cleaning and drying of the pens is a highly recommended management practice for killing roundworm eggs. These are, however, hard to comply with in practice.Looking to the future, the percentage of Ascaris-favourable production systems is expected to rise due to increasing consumer demand for drug free, biologically grown, free-range pork and the forthcoming implementation of new regulations for increased pig wellbeing. In Denmark for example, sprinkler systems should be applied in the pens of growing pigs and sows to accommodate a daily shower. Moreover, sows should not be tethered and housed in groups in enriched environments (bedding, wallowing) for part of the gestation (Roepstorff et al., 2011a; Thamsborg et al., 2010). As a result, the number of eggs surviving in the pens will increase and with it, the prevalence of Ascaris and other pig parasites (Haugegaard, 2010). Good diagnostic assessments will be necessary to evaluate how these changes in farm management will affect parasite epidemiology.|$|R
