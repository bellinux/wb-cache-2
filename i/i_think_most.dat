500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta, and {{directed}} by Ken Kwapis. [...] "Company Picnic" [...] was the 100th overall episode of The Office, and show creator Greg Daniels said he was especially proud the series made it to that landmark because he felt it meant he did not disappoint Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who created the original British version of the show. Daniels said, [...] "I remember interviewing with them seven years ago, and this (100th episode) was certainly the goal, so I'm very pleased that we got to 100 episodes in a strong fashion. I think the show {{is in a very}} good place right now." [...] Steve Carell said he was especially pleased with the landmark because when the show began, people had doubts it would live up to the original series and were skeptical about its mockumentary style: [...] "It's sort of remarkable, especially with this show because I don't think anybody felt it would go past the pilot. ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> everyone was kind of dubious about our chances of pulling it off." [...] Likewise, Ben Silverman, co-chairman of NBC Entertainment and an Office executive producer, said, [...] "It's a thrill that we got to 100 episodes, and probably incredibly surprising looking back at the process it took. But the reality is, we believed in it." ...|$|E

He had that sort of air of command about him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2008, the duo drew {{criticism}} {{from the office of}} Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin after they told listeners that the election had been postponed and that Democrats should cast their votes on November 5 (the day after Election Day). Galvin's spokesperson said the show was doing a disservice to voters and warned them that they could be violating a state law against interfering with elections. In response, Gerry Callahan stated [...] "Obviously it was a joke and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> listeners understood it was a joke".|$|E
2500|$|Laudrup's {{departure}} from Barcelona {{was a huge}} blow for the fans and his teammates alike. Reflecting on his time at Barcelona, he commented, [...] "I think we played some very good football, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> of all we demonstrated that even without getting the ten {{best players in the}} world, you can have the best team. Because everybody talked about Begiristain, Bakero, Guardiola, Stoichkov, and Koeman, but when we started none of us was a best player, then we became maybe {{the best team in the}} world, together with AC Milan in that period." ...|$|E

What then happens when CEOs go into the boardroom, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> of my colleagues around the table know, is that they tend to generate some excitement by directors themselves. Directors are really starting, in some regard, to go back to basics. One CEO said to me about a week ago, 'Being a board member is starting to be fun again,' and that is not something this particular CEO, who is on a lot of large-cap boards, would have said a year ago." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2011, Santorum said {{he would}} {{continue}} to [...] "fight very strongly against libertarian influence within the Republican Party and the conservative movement." [...] In an interview with NPR in the summer of 2005, Santorum discussed what he called the [...] "libertarianish right", saying [...] "they have this idea that people should be left alone, be able to do whatever they want to do. Government should keep our taxes down and keep our regulation low and that we shouldn't get involved in the bedroom, we shouldn't get involved in cultural issues, you know, people should do whatever they want. Well, that is not how traditional conservatives view the world, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> conservatives understand that individuals can't go it alone...." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Kramer {{delivered}} {{the final of}} four drafts of a novel that he wrote about the fast lifestyle of gay men of Fire Island and Manhattan. In Faggots, the primary character was modeled on himself, {{a man who is}} unable to find love while encountering the drugs and emotionless sex in the trendy bars and discos. He stated his inspiration for the novel: [...] "I wanted to be in love. Almost everybody I knew felt the same way. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> people, at some level, wanted what I was looking for, whether they pooh-poohed it or said that we can't live like the straight people or whatever excuses they gave." [...] Kramer researched the book, talking to many men, and visiting various establishments. As he interviewed people, he heard a common question: [...] "Are you writing a negative book? Are you going to make it positive? ... I began to think, 'My God, people must really be conflicted about the lives they're leading.' And that was true. I think people were guilty about all the promiscuity and all the partying." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unlike his {{predecessors}} Len Hutton, Peter May and Ted Dexter Smith rode [...] "... {{the side with}} a loose rein, believing it knew where it was going and need only an occasional tug to keep it on the right course. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> players appreciated this and his openness as a person brought a better response on the field". He thought that any bowler good enough to play for England knew what field suited him best, and generally let his men play in their own style, though this resulted in slow over rates as he did not chivvy them along. Even the truculent fast bowler John Snow [...] "...thought he was very astute in his handling of players..." [...] and recalled [...] "...Mike Smith adding {{a few words of}} congratulations in his thoroughly open, absent-minded-professor sort of way". E.W. Swanton reported that [...] "Smith, though outwardly unconventional and in manner casual to a degree, succeeds as a captain for the conventional reasons. He is thoughtful for his players, unselfish, does not 'fuss' them or panic, shows a grasp of the situation which they deem generally sensible, and not least gives an inspiring personal lead in the field".|$|E
2500|$|La Russa {{says it is}} {{important}} that relievers know their roles and the situations which they will be called into a game. He added, [...] "Sure, games can get away from you in the seventh and eighth, but those last three outs in the ninth are the toughest. You want the guy who can handle that pressure. That, to me, is most important." [...] Oakland general manager Billy Beane said there would be too much media criticism if a pitcher other than the closer lost the game in the ninth." [...] Managerial moves are immediately questioned with millions of fans having access to ESPN, the MLB Network, and other cable channels. Former manager Jim Fregosi said managers do not like to be second-guessed. [...] "Even if you know the odds, it's more comfortable being wrong {{when you go to the}} closer", said Beane. [...] He noted the incremental increase gained by a closer in a three-run save situation [...] "is worth it because losing is so painful in that situation." [...] Baseball announcer Chris Wheeler noted that there is pressure on managers to pitch closers in the ninth inning when they were paid big money to pitch in that role. Former general manager Pat Gillick said closers become one-inning pitchers as managers began copying the practice of having setup pitchers enter before closers. [...] "There are just too many specialists, guys who can only pitch one inning and only pitch certain innings and throw only 20 pitches. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>most</b> pitchers are capable of pitching more", said Gillick.|$|E
