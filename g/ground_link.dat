50|$|Slider-crank chain {{inversion}} {{arises when}} the connecting rod, or coupler, of a slider-crank linkage becomes the <b>ground</b> <b>link,</b> so the slider is connected {{directly to the}} crank.

50|$|All scope probes {{contain some}} {{facility}} for grounding (earthing) the probe to the circuit's reference voltage. This is usually accomplished by connecting {{a very short}} pigtail wire from the probe head to ground. Inductance in the ground wire can lead to distortion in the observed signal, so this wire is kept as short as possible. Some probes use a small ground foot instead of any wire, allowing the <b>ground</b> <b>link</b> to be as short as 10 mm.|$|E
50|$|Peaucellier-Lipkin {{linkages}} (PLLs) {{may have}} several inversions. A typical example {{is shown in}} the opposite figure, in which a rocker-slider four-bar serves as the input driver.

50|$|Planar {{quadrilateral}} linkage, RRRR or 4R linkages {{have four}} rotating joints. One link {{of the chain}} is usually fixed, and is called the <b>ground</b> <b>link,</b> fixed link, or the frame. The two links {{connected to the frame}} are called the grounded links and are generally the input and output links of the system, sometimes called the input link and output link. The last link is the floating link, which is also called a coupler or connecting rod because it connects an input to the output.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after Opennet started up, on 26 February 1996 {{the first}} {{commercial}} Yugoslav ISP, Beotel, established a 512 kbit/s satellite link with the Norwegian ISP Taide.net.

It started with a 2 Mbit/s digital <b>ground</b> <b>link</b> with Amsterdam and remains the largest and strongest ISP in Serbia.

50|$|This {{formulation}} of the input-output synthesis of a four-bar linkage is an inversion of finite-position synthesis, where {{the movement of the}} output crank relative to the input crank is specified by the designer. From this viewpoint the <b>ground</b> <b>link</b> OC is a crank that satisfies the specified finite positions of the movement of the output crank relative to the input crank, and Burmester's results show that its existence guarantees the presence of at least one coupler link. Furthermore, Burmester's results show that there may be as many as three of these coupler links that provide the desired input-output relationship.|$|E
50|$|Between 1967 and 1974 he was Director of Programmes and Planning at the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO) in Paris, {{which was}} merged in 1975 {{to form the}} European Space Agency (ESA). In early 1975, the Programmes and Planning {{department}} was split into a department for the Communication Satellite Programme (for MAROTS, the maritime navigation satellite, and Orbital Test Satellite, OTS), and a department for Science and Meteosat. Meteosat-1 had been first launched in November 1977, and was controlled by EUMETSAT from 1983 in Darmstadt, Germany. The <b>ground</b> <b>link</b> was to the Fucino Space Centre in Italy, currently run by Telespazio.

5000|$|Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are {{the primary}} {{inertial}} system for maintaining current position (navigation) and orientation in missiles and aircraft. They are complex machines {{with one or more}} rotating Gyroscopes that can rotate freely in 3 degrees of motion within a complex gimbal system. IMUs are [...] "spun up" [...] and calibrated prior to launch. A minimum of 3 separate IMUs are in place within most complex systems. In addition to relative position, the IMUs contain accelerometers which can measure acceleration in all axes. The position data, combined with acceleration data provide the necessary inputs to [...] "track" [...] motion of a vehicle. IMUs have a tendency to [...] "drift", due to friction and accuracy. Error correction to address this drift can be provided via <b>ground</b> <b>link</b> telemetry, GPS, radar, optical celestial navigation and other navigation aids. When targeting another (moving) vehicle, relative vectors become paramount. In this situation, navigation aids which provide updates of position relative to the target are more important. In addition to the current position, inertial navigation systems also typically estimate a predicted position for future computing cycles. See also Inertial navigation system.|$|E

This method, known as the rigid conductor process (RCP), involves the mounting of a preformed, sintered, and tested superconductor material onto an appropriate, rigid substrate with an epoxy adhesive which also serves to encapsulate the element from the ambient environment.
