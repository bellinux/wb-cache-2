5|$|To {{deal with}} this {{shortage}} of educational opportunities, Scott Weiner et al. suggest that countries with developed emergency medical systems should focus on training the trainers. This, he believes, is a sustainable approach to promote the development of emergency medicine worldwide. It works by sending developed country health care workers to equip {{a small group of}} trainees with the necessary skills to then go on and teach the concepts to others. As such, it may be able to leverage the insights of developed emergency medical systems while remaining sustainable, as the newly trained trainers continue to spread the knowledge. The Tuscan Emergency Medicine Initiative is an example, with physicians from other specialties currently working in emergency departments being taught <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> a new group of emergency medical specialists.|$|E

As a solely graduate-level program, this is based on the principle that people need to learn primary subject matter well before they can learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> it to others.

As Dave Connell, one of Sesame Streets {{original}} producers, has stated, {{it was difficult}} to find adults who could identify a preschooler's interest level. Fifteen writers a year worked on the show's scripts, but very few lasted longer than one season. Norman Stiles, head writer in 1987, reported that most writers would [...] "burn out" [...] after writing about a dozen scripts. According to Gikow, Sesame Street went against the convention of hiring teachers to write for the show, as most educational television programs did at the time. Instead, Cooney and the producers felt that {{it would be easier to}} teach writers how to interpret curriculum than to teach educators how to write comedy. As Stone stated, [...] "Writing for children is not so easy". Long-time writer Tony Geiss agreed, stating in 2009, [...] "It's not an easy show to write. You have to know the characters and the format and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> and be funny at the same time, which is a big, ambidextrous stunt".|$|E

2500|$|Validity, efficacy, and {{predictive}} power. Many {{contend that}} overuse and misuse {{of these tests}} harms teaching and learning by narrowing the curriculum. According to the group FairTest, when standardized tests are the primary factor in accountability, schools use the tests to narrowly define curriculum and focus instruction. Accountability creates an immense pressure to perform and {{this can lead to}} the misuse and misinterpretation of standardized tests. FairTest says that negative consequences of test misuse include narrowing the curriculum, teaching to the test, pushing students out of school, driving teachers out of the profession, and undermining student engagement and school climate. Critics say that [...] "teaching to the test" [...] disfavors higher-order learning. While it is possible to use a standardized test without letting its contents determine curriculum and instruction, frequently, what is not tested is not taught, and how the subject is tested often becomes a model for <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> the subject.|$|E

[...] Rawlinson argues that the literary references in the text are structured to mirror a 1707 Cambridge University pamphlet entitled A Method of Instructing Pupils (a guide on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> Philosophy).

2500|$|Dewey’s passions for teaching—a natural {{love for}} working with young children, a natural {{propensity}} to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social {{issues related to the}} profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with others—are not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills. [...] Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which “work automatically, unconsciously” (Dewey, 1904, p.15). [...] According to Dewey, teacher education programs must turn away from focusing on producing proficient practitioners because such practical skills related to instruction and discipline (e.g. creating and delivering lesson plans, classroom management, implementation of an assortment of content-specific methods) can be learned over time during their everyday school work with their students (Dewey, PST, 2010). [...] As Dewey notes, [...] "The teacher who leaves the professional school with power in managing a class of children may appear to superior advantage the first day, the first week, the first month, or even the first year, as compared with some other teacher who has a much more vital command of the psychology, logic and ethics of development. [...] But later ‘progress’ may with such consist only in perfecting and refining skill already possessed. [...] Such persons seem to know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach,</b> but they are not students of teaching. [...] Even though they go on studying books of pedagogy, reading teachers’ journals, attending teachers’ institutes, etc., yet the root of the matter is not in them, unless they continue to be students of subject-matter, and students of mind-activity. [...] Unless a teacher is such a student, he may continue to improve in the mechanics of school management, but he cannot grow as a teacher, an inspirer and director of soul-life" [...] (Dewey, 1904, p.15). [...] For Dewey, teacher education should focus not on producing persons who know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> as soon as they leave the program; rather, teacher education should be concerned with producing professional students of education who have the propensity to inquire about the subjects they teach, the methods used, and the activity of the mind as it gives and receives knowledge. [...] According to Dewey, such a student is not superficially engaging with these materials, rather, the professional student of education has a genuine passion to inquire about the subjects of education, knowing that doing so ultimately leads to acquisitions of the skills related to teaching. [...] Such students of education aspire for the intellectual growth within the profession that can only be achieved by immersing one’s self in the lifelong pursuit of the intelligence, skills and character Dewey linked to the profession.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pedagogy}} of cognitivism {{prevalent in}} the early 1970s and early 1980s also promotes the idea of process over product, {{but it is a}} more scientific approach to composition studies and is opposed to moderate expressivism in many ways. Abstractly speaking, cognitivists believe that thinking exists in the mind apart from language and are concerned with understanding how language—or writing—is developed from mental processes of the mind. Cognitivists are primarily concerned with the goals of a writer, the decisions made during the writing process by the mind. Andrea Lunsford addresses the importance of understanding the cognitive mental faculties involved during composition, claiming {{that the best way to}} facilitate the writing process is through workshops and discussion rather than lecture-based instruction. [...] Researchers like cognitivist Sondra Perl conduct extensive studies of the composing process and the stages through which a writer goes in order to better understand <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> writing. Cognitivists Linda Flower and John Hayes see an exigency in composition studies to understand how and why a writer makes the choices they do during the writing process. Their research led them to claim that writing is a non-linear, hierarchal, goal-driven process. In addition, they concentrate their study of composition on the protocol of the writing process, including planning, translating, embedding, and reviewing. While like expressivists in their greater concern with the process of writing than with the final product, distinguishing them from the essay-driven pedagogy of current-traditional rhetoric, cognitivism proposes a more scientific approach by studying universal cognitive faculties of the mind in order to better understand the composition process.|$|E
