40|$|Small scaled Russian {{exploratory}} fishing for krill in the Southern Ocean {{began in the}} late 1960 s. During the 1970 s the fisheries increased and annual catches of krill have exhibited a number of fluctuations since the beginning of commercial harvesting. Some of these changes have resulted from developments in technology and products whilst others have their origins in global economics and politics. The largest catches were reported in season 1981 - 1982 with more than 500 000 tonnes. Since 1989, the catches have been on a much lower level. The current krill fishery starts in December and ends usually in August-September. Although krill fishing is permitted {{in many parts of the}} Southern Ocean, the current fishery is concentrated around the South Shetland Islands and Bransfield Strait, the South Orkneys and South Georgia. These areas are located in CCAMLR (Commission on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living resources) statistical subareas 48. 1 to 48. 3. Norway participated with three vessels in the 2014 / 15 season and landed 146, 968 tonnes, followed by China with 35, 427 tonnes and South Korea with 23, 342 tonnes.

40|$|Aquafeed {{production}} faces {{global issues}} related to availability of feed ingredients. Feed manufacturers require greater flexibility {{in order to develop}} nutritional and cost-effective formulations that take into account nutrient content and availability of ingredients. The search for appropriate ingredients requires detailed screening of their potential nutritional value and variability at the industrial level. In vitro digestion of feedstuffs by enzymes extracted from the target species has been correlated with apparent protein digestibility (APD) in fish and shrimp species. The present study verified the relationship between APD and in vitro degree of protein hydrolysis (DH) with Litopenaeus vannamei hepatopancreas enzymes in several different ingredients (n = 26) : blood meals, casein, corn gluten meal, crab meal, distiller`s dried grains with solubles, feather meal, fish <b>meals,</b> gelatin, <b>krill</b> <b>meals,</b> poultry by-product meal, soybean meals, squid meals and wheat gluten. The relationship between APD and DH was further verified in diets formulated with these ingredients at 30 % inclusion into a reference diet. APD was determined in vivo (30. 1 +/- 0. 5 degrees C, 32. 2 +/- 0. 4 %.) with juvenile L vannamei (9 to 12 g) after placement of test ingredients into a reference diet (35 g kg(- 1) CP: 8. 03 g kg(- 1) lipid; 2. 01 kcal g(- 1)) with chromic oxide as the inert marker. In vitro DH was assessed in ingredients and diets with standardized hepatopancreas enzymes extracted from pond-reared shrimp. The DH of ingredients was determined under different assay conditions to check for the most suitable in vitro protocol for APD prediction: different batches of enzyme extracts (HPf 5 or HPf 6), temperatures (25 or 30 degrees C) and enzyme activity (azocasein) : crude protein ratios (4 U: 80 mg CP or 4 U: 40 mg CP). DH was not affected by ingredient proximate composition. APD was significantly correlated to DH in regressions considering either ingredients or diets. The relationships between APD and DH of the ingredients could be suitably adjusted to a Rational Function (y = (a + bx) /(1 + cx + dx 2), n = 26. Best in vitro APD predictions were obtained at 25 degrees C, 4 U: 80 mg CP both for ingredients (R(2) = 0. 86 : P = 0. 001) and test diets (R(2) = 0. 96; P = 0. 007). The regression model including all 26 ingredients generated higher prediction residuals (i. e., predicted APD - determined APD) for corn gluten meal, feather meal. poultry by-product <b>meal</b> and <b>krill</b> flour. The remaining test ingredients presented mean prediction residuals of 3. 5 points. A model including only ingredients with APD> 80 % showed higher prediction precision (R(2) = 0. 98 : P = 0. 000004; n = 20) with average residual of 1. 8 points. Predictive models including only ingredients from the same origin (e. g., marine-based, R(2) = 0. 98; P = 0. 033) also displayed low residuals. Since in vitro techniques have been usually validated through regressions against in vivo APD, the DH predictive capacity may depend on the consistency of the in vivo methodology. Regressions between APD and DH suggested a close relationship between peptide bond breakage by hepatopancreas digestive proteases and the apparent nitrogen assimilation in shrimp, and this may be a useful tool to provide rapid nutritional information.

40|$|Salmonids are {{considered}} as fatty fish {{and a healthy}} food. They are characterized by {{a high proportion of}} n- 3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n- 3 LCPUFA). There is great interest in producing high-quality salmonids with a reduced use of fish-based materials and a challenge to adjust feeds towards more sustainable. This thesis investigated the effects of sesamin, linseed oil (LO), rapeseed oil (RO),krill oil (KO), <b>krill</b> meal(KM), mussel <b>meal</b> (MM), and zygomycete meal (ZM) (Rhizopus oryzae) on fish performance, fatty acid profiles, carotenoids, cytochrome P 450 (CYP 450) and, colour properties and oxidation in the white muscle of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). No negative effects on fish performance were found when KM, KO, MM, ZM and sesamin were included in the fish feeds. The FA profile was modified significantly by these feed compounds. LO and RO increased the α-linolenic acid (ALA) level and decreased the n- 3 LCPUFA portion. Sesamin significantly decreased the ALA level and slightly increased the DHA level in some groups of Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout. Stripped-LO showed different effects on the portion of EPA and ALA compared to the LO group. The sesamin content in fish liver was consistent with its level in feeds, while the content in white muscle was similar across all groups. KO, KM and MM contributed a high portion of n- 3 LCPUFA and under 3. 5 mg/kg astaxanthin to the white muscle of Arctic charr, enhancing a* value. Some groups {{with a high level of}} astaxanthin showed high level of oxidation products (thiobarbituric reactive substances). Sesamin and ZM significantly affected the level or activity of CYP 450. The results of this thesis reveal the different effects of the non-fish-based materials on the fatty acid profile and colour properties in salmonids, suggesting that these feed compounds can be used to improve fish quality with an optimised formula. Results also indicate that new feed raw materials need further evaluation before the full application in commercial fish feeds...|$|R
40|$|<b>Krill</b> <b>meal</b> (KM) is a {{potential}} feed ingredient that can replace fish meal (FM) in aquaculture. To better understand the efficacy of <b>krill</b> <b>meal,</b> a 200 -day feeding trial was conducted with Russian sturgeons (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii). Four extruded diets in which KM replaced 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, or 30 % of FM in the formulation were fed to 481 g sturgeons for 200 d. Russian sturgeons that were fed diets containing KM grew as fast as or even better than fish fed with FM control diet. No differences were observed in terms of dorsal muscle composition in the fish fed with diets including KM and those fed with FM control diet. Meanwhile, the fluoride concentrations in the dorsal muscle, liver, and kidney, as well as swim bladder in all dietary groups were below detectable limit. In the gills, skin, vertebral bone and dorsal scutes, the fluoride content from the KM groups progressively increased with dietary fluoride concentration. In conclusion, KM can partially substitute for FM in the diets of Russian sturgeon without affecting normal growth performance...|$|E

40|$|Litopenaeus vannamei or Pacific white shrimp is {{the most}} widely farmed {{crustacean}} in the world. Shrimp are commonly fed feed containing 30 - 40 % soybean meal or other plant-based feeds that are more economically and environmentally sustainable than animal-based feed. However, plant-based pellets are less palatable and less chemically attractive compared to animal material. Based on that, current research and practice includes the addition of specific marine animal meals {{in order to enhance}} palatability and attractability of plant-based shrimp feed. Yet, it is not sustainable or economically achievable to continue relying on marine animal meal. In the herein study, the effect of proprietary chemical mixtures designed by our research group as feed additives was examined based on their attractability and palatability in comparison to <b>krill</b> <b>meal,</b> a highly attractive and palatable supplement for shrimp feed. In palatability assays, total amount of pellets was measured before and after one-hour and three-hour periods of feeding in group-housed animals. In attractability assays, responses of shrimp were measured {{based on the number of}} probes and grabs on the source (airstone) of the stimulus being released. Each diet-set used contained different concentrations of <b>krill</b> <b>meal</b> and synthetic chemical mixtures. Results demonstrated these chemical mixtures enhance attractability and palatability of soybean based feed in L. vannamei when compared to <b>krill</b> <b>meal.</b> Furthermore, the addition of a proprietary mixture (= “premix”) improved responses in the attractability assays when compared to stimuli that did not contain the premix. Overall, results support the hypothesis that synthetic chemical mixtures can improve palatability and attractability of soybean meal based shrimp feed.

40|$|The short-tailed shearwater Puffinus tenuirostris {{is one of}} the world’s most {{abundant}} seabirds, with a population of around 23 million breeding birds. Despite this abundance we have a limited understanding of their role in the marine ecosystem. This is largely due to the many uncertainties surrounding the trophic interactions, resource requirements and foraging ecology of this wide ranging pelagic seabird. I studied the movement of adults during the short trip (ST) and long trip (LT) component of their dual foraging strategy to determine how they use their marine habitat. ST were primarily confined to neritic (continental shelf) waters 30 to 100 km from their colony, and maximum depth gauges revealed that birds reached a depth of 21 ± 13 m (SD). Analysis of the time spent in area by 39 individuals performing ST revealed that 18 birds employed area restricted searches within circles of a diameter of 14 ± 3 km (SE). Prey returns from area restricted search flights were predominated by bony fish, whereas prey diversity increased for non-area restricted search flights, with more krill and cephalopods. Thus, direct flights were performed when birds were exploiting prey patches dominated by fish, in contrast to the more varied diet returned when birds covered greater distances. LT flights were highly variable ranging from 11 - 32 days duration, and reaching 912 – 6, 952 km from the colony. Foraging trips of extended duration enabled birds to exploit temperate waters further away from the colony, as well as sub Antarctic and Antarctic waters. A wider range of search patterns were performed on LT, as birds either: (1) showed no signs of area restricted search; (2) concentrated area restricted search directly at small scales of within circles of 33 ± 11 km (SE) diameter; or, (3) adopted a hierarchical mode of foraging, where large scales of area restricted search are first performed, followed by nested searches at smaller scales. This variation in foraging behaviour indicates that a range of foraging tactics are employed by the short-tailed shearwater. LT to sub Antarctic and Antarctic waters commonly involved a period of commuting travel to regions with elevated chlorophyll a associated with ocean fronts, where search effort was increased. How adults allocated time and energy during the entire chick-rearing period was investigated via the simultaneous assessment of adult attendance, adult mass change, the rate of energy delivery to chicks, and chick survival. Adults who reared chicks to good condition spent 80 % of the 90 day chick rearing period performing five - six LT of 13 ± 3 days (SE) duration. The remaining 20 % of time involved 14 ± 3 ST (SE) of one to three days duration. Comparison with chicks of moderate and poor condition revealed that, despite extensive variation in the day to day rate of provisioning, a small change in the proportion of time spent performing ST and LT over the entire chick rearing period can spell the difference between breeding success and failure. By allocating all of the food collected on ST to chicks birds depleted stored energy reserves, which were replenished on LT. Of the total energy required by chicks from hatching to adult abandonment 75 % was delivered from LT in the form of energy rich stomach oil, with the remainder being supplied in ST meals of raw prey. The advantages of the dual foraging strategy to both adult and chick was demonstrated by considering the daily food requirements of chicks and the likely energy flow from alternate feeding regimes. Under regimes of all ST or all LT, energy flow to chicks could not meet chick energy requirements. This highlights that LT of more than seven days duration are required to accumulate stomach oil. Oil boosts the energy value of meals beyond that achievable in continuous ST foraging. Under continuous ST the estimated rate of food consumption achieved by adults would not sustain both adult and chick requirements. Therefore the dual strategy enables short-tailed shearwaters to overcome many of the constraints of central-place foraging. Comparisons between years and short-tailed shearwater colonies revealed extensive variation in the dietary composition of meals returned to chicks, as well as the rate of food delivery. A year of increased ST foraging resulted in an increase in feeding frequency, but not provisioning rate, as smaller meals were returned. In this same year ST meals also contained a high % mass of low energy neritic prey (Australian krill Nyctiphanes australis and cephalopods). These factors reduced the rate of energy flow to chicks compared to other years where fewer ST meals of increased mass contained mostly higher energy fish (jack mackerel Trachurus declivis and anchovy Engraulis australis). While the rate of chick growth at different ages varied between years, a similar peak mass was gained in all three years. These findings demonstrate considerable flexibility in the dual foraging strategy of the short-tailed shearwater, providing evidence that adults are able to maintain a suitable rate of energy flow to chicks in years of varied neritic foraging conditions. This is achieved by modifying the time spent performing ST, and the volume of oil returned from LT, likely in response to changing prey availability. A review of the use of seabirds in fisheries management identified the most commonly used indicators (species and parameters) in environmental, ecological and fisheries management. For the short-tailed shearwater the most useful parameters for identifying the size of pelagic fish stocks in neritic waters include the size and dietary composition of meals returned on ST. The varied importance of pilchard Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis australis in the diet between years suggest that their occurrence in the diet meals present a potential indicator of the availability of pre-recruits into the South Australian pilchard fishery. The occurrence of Australian <b>Krill</b> in ST <b>meals</b> may also provide a means of investigating the ecological role of upwelling events in neritic waters. The usefulness of provisioning parameters as indicators of prey availability are likely to be limited in this species, due to the extent of flexibility and plasticity in the short-tailed shearwaters provisioning strategy. Documenting the extent of flexibility in the foraging strategy, and quantifying the value of the ST and LT component of the dual foraging strategy has provided an insight into the habitat utilisation and prey requirements of this species. This demonstrates that despite the various constraints incurred in sourcing and transporting prey over long distances, dual foraging presents the most optimal foraging strategy for the delivery of energy to adult and chick. The sheer abundance of this species is evidence that the separation of their foraging and breeding grounds over 3000 km is a beneficial strategy. An opportunistic diet, and flexibility in foraging suggests that the short-tailed shearwater is more resilient to changes in prey availability than other seabirds in their community. However, we have highlighted that breeding success is sensitive to small changes in the time spent foraging in near and distant waters. Sourcing prey over large spatial scales also exposes birds to feeding conditions over a broader area, increasing their exposure to the potential effects of current and future climate change. For these reasons the short-tailed shearwater presents a valuable indicator species for short and long-term monitoring programs of both neritic and oceanic ecosystems. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|A {{series of}} three feeding trials was {{conducted}} to {{determine the influence of}} different marine protein sources on growth, survival and thyroid hormone (T 3 and T 4) levels in barramundi larvae. Experimental diets including various proportions of fish meal, squid powder, mussel meal and <b>krill</b> <b>meal</b> were assessed in 14 -day feeding trials. The suitability and appropriate inclusion levels of these protein sources for microbound diet formulations were assessed in an integrated manner, relating protein quality indices (amino acid profile and digestibility) to larval performance indices (growth, survival and thyroid hormone level) to elucidate mechanisms underlying the nutritional regulation of growth promotion in Lates calcarifer. Larvae fed diets containing a combination of fish meal and squid powder showed greater growth than larvae fed diets containing either mussel meal or <b>krill</b> <b>meal.</b> Larvae fed diets containing a 9 : 1 ratio of fish meal to squid powder, on a gross protein basis, had a higher final mean dry weight than those fed all other diets except the diet containing an 80 : 20 ratio of fish meal to squid powder, which had an intermediate value. Fish meal and squid powder were found to have a high nutritional value as protein sources for L. calcarifer larvae, by virtue of a synergistically favourable amino acid profile, moderate to high digestibility and low water solubility. The digestibility of squid powder was found to be significantly higher than that of fish meal, indicating that further development of this diet may benefit from processing techniques to increase fish meal digestibility. Thyroxine (T 4) levels were found to relate strongly to growth, but did not relate specifically to any particular dietary composition, indicating that T 4 is an appropriate indicator of growth performance in L. calcarifer larvae, though may not directly and quantitatively mediate nutritional growth promotion. © 2006 Elsevier B.

One sequence was flavored with 10 % <b>krill</b> <b>meal</b> (Euphausia sp.). Training success of fish fed the GFF- 00 diet flavored with krill reached 12 %ª compared to 11. 6 %ª (p < 0. 05) for diets without <b>krill</b> <b>meal.</b> A second experiment was set up with 969, 1. 5 g fish, trained with GFF with 39. 8 % success. After the feed training period, 2. 2 g fish were then fed a sequence of moist pellets containing 80 %, 60 % and 45 % GFF. Fish trained to feed on moist pellets with 45 % ground fish were pooled and stocked into nine 25 L cages. Fish were weaned to dry pellets without ground fish flesh (GFF- 00) using three diet sequences: 1) dry pellets; 2) moist pellets; and 3) dry pellets flavored with 4 % cod liver oil; all three diets contained 30, 10 and 0 % GFF. The three sequences yielded, respectively 30. 8 %ª, 23. 6 %ª, and 24. 7 %ª (p < 0. 05) fish feeding on GFF- 00. There were no apparent beneficial effects of increasing moisture or addition of cod liver oil as flavor enhancers in the weaning diets. This study revealed the feasibility of training peacock bass to accept dry pellets, but feeding young fish ground fish flesh {{seemed to be a}} major bottleneck in improving feed training success...|$|E
40|$|Reduction of the {{environmental}} impact of feed products is of paramount importance for salmon farming. This article explores the potential to compare three thermodynamically based ecological indicators. The environmental impact of partial replacement of fish meal (FM) and fish oil with alternative ingredients was investigated using energy, classical exergy and eco-exergy analysis. Seven hypothetical feeds were formulated: one with high levels of FM and fish oil, four feeds based on plant ingredients, one containing <b>krill</b> <b>meal,</b> and one based on algae-derived products. Analysis included cultivation of crops and algae, fishing for fish and krill, industrial processing of these ingredients and production of complete fish feed. Because most harvested products are refined in multiple product outputs that have good value to society, two scenarios were compared. In the base case scenario, no allocation of co-products was used and all {{the environmental}} costs were ascribed to one specific co-product. Co-product allocation by mass was used in the second scenario; this is considered to be the preferred scenario because it accurately reflects the individual contributions of the co-products to {{the environmental impact of}} the feed products. For this scenario, the total energy consumption for a fish-based diet was 14, 500 MJ, which was similar to a krill diet (15, 600 MJ), about 15 – 31 % higher than plant-based diets, and 9 % higher than an algae diet. Substituting FM and fish oil with alternative ingredients resulted in minor changes in total classical exergy degradation (2 – 16 % difference). The calculations based on energy only consider the energy conservation based on the First Law of Thermodynamics, whereas those based on classical exergy also takes the Second Law of Thermodynamics into account; energy that can do work is distinguished from energy that is lost as heat to the environment. The calculations based on eco-exergy consider the total loss of work energy in the environment including the work energy associated with the information embodied in the genomes of organisms. The diet based on fishery-derived ingredients was the highest total work energy consumer compared with plant-based diets (24 – 30 % greater), the diet containing <b>krill</b> <b>meal</b> (25 % greater), and the algae diet (four times higher). Thus, reducing FM and fish oil levels in fish feed can contribute significantly to more sustainable aquaculture. In particular, algae-derived products in aquafeeds could drastically decrease environmental costs in the future...|$|E
40|$|Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) may be {{the largest}} biomass of a single species {{worldwide}} and is a promising ingredient for use in fish feeds. Krill have a balanced amino acid profile, and krill lipids are rich in phospholipids with {{a high concentration of}} n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, krill are highly palatable to fish. The limitations in availability of fish meal worldwide, and the increasing decline in pelagic fish populations increase fish meal prices. Use of krill in fish feed must be funded on science-based, sustainable krill harvest. The main objective of this thesis was to enhance understanding of Antarctic krill as a feed ingredient for salmonids. The sub objectives were to increase knowledge regarding: 1) nutritional effects of krill shell in fish feeds; 2) response to different dietary levels of <b>krill</b> <b>meal</b> in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar); and 3) uptake and accumulation of fluoride in salmonids reared in fresh or salt water. Atlantic salmon reared in salt water, fed whole <b>krill</b> <b>meal</b> (WKM) at the expense of fish meal, grew at a lower rate during the first feeding period compared to fish fed fish meal or partly deshelled <b>krill</b> <b>meal</b> (PDKM). In a second experiment, increasing levels of a PDKM:pea protein concentrate (PPC) mixture (3. 5 : 1) in diets for Atlantic salmon showed an optimum growth rate at a PDKM/PPC level of 400 g kg– 1. In both experiments there were larger differences in growth rates and/or weight gain between the krill fed fish and the fish meal control group during {{the early part of the}} experiment compared to the total feeding period. Complete replacement of fish meal with WKM in diets for Atlantic salmon, reared in salt water, tended to reduce lipid digestibility compared to a replacement with PDKM. Increasing dietary level of a PDKM/PPC mixture, on the other hand, gave a linear increase in lipid digestibility. Salmon fed WKM or an increased level of PDKM/PPC had lower digestibility of several amino acids compared to those fed fish meal as the sole protein source. The high dietary copper level in the WKM and PDKM were excreted through the salmon faeces. There was no increase in copper accumulation in liver or whole body of salmon fed these diets. Histological changes in the kidney where observed in salmon fed diets with WKM or PDKM. These changes were described as mild to moderate degeneration, apoptosis and/or necrosis of renal tubule cells. Similarly, feeding increasing levels of a PDKM/PPC mixture to salmon produced dose dependent histological changes in the kidney. Despite the low dietary bioavailability of fluoride in salt water reared fish, we hypothized that the high dietary fluoride level in the krill meals caused the observed kidney changes. This was based on findings in other animals. High dietary fluoride fed to salmon reared in freshwater did, however, not induce similar kidney changes as seen in the krill fed salmon reared in salt water. Freshwater reared salmon fed diets with a fluoride level at 3, 500 mg kg– 1 from sodium fluoride (NaF), however, had crystalline material within distal tubules and/or collecting ducts in the kidney, which probably are small ureterolithiasis (commonly called kidney stones). Dietary fluoride in the form of NaF was quickly absorbed and reached a peak in plasma fluoride at three hours in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Trout fed fluoride from krill shell did not show the same clear peak in plasma concentration, and the estimated cumulative absorption of fluoride was reduced by nearly that half compared to the NaF fed fish. Supplementation of dietary calcium nearly prevented the fluoride uptake in fish fed the NaF diet, while adding calcium to the diets with krill shell reduced the uptake to nearly the half. Atlantic salmon reared in freshwater and fed a low-fluoride control diet or two diets with fluoride levels of 150 or 350 mg kg– 1 with krill shells as fluoride source had higher faecal excretion of fluoride compared to salmon fed fluoride levels of 1, 500 and 3, 500 mg kg– 1 from NaF. Salmon fed the two krill shell diets showed no difference in fluoride accumulation in whole body, bone, muscle, liver, or kidney compared to the low-fluoride control fed fish. Fish fed the NaF diets showed increased fluoride accumulation in both liver and kidney, and especially in the bones. The major implications of this research for practical feed production are that when using a high inclusion of kill in diets for Atlantic salmon, a partly deshelled <b>krill</b> <b>meal</b> is preferred to avoid possible negative effects of the shell fraction on growth rates and nutrient digestibility. Diets containing 150 and 350 mg fluoride kg– 1 from krill did not cause any histological changes in gills, liver or kidneys of Atlantic salmon reared in freshwater. The high concentration of calcium and magnesium in salt water is probably the main cause for the strong limitation in fluoride uptake in salmon...|$|E

The experimental system was stocked with 11 -day-old larvae, which were co-fed micro-diets and live food from 11 dph to 17 dph then micro-diets only until 28 dph. Survival from 11 dph to 28 dph was similar for all treatments, {{with an average}} of 33 %. At the end of the trial, the Gemma larvae were significantly longer and heavier than larvae fed the other diets. Significant differences were observed in fatty acid composition of the diets and larvae between treatments. The Gemma larvae incorporated the lowest amount of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA). However, they had the highest DHA/EPA and ARA/EPA ratios, which is in agreement with the concept that the proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids could be of greater importance than their absolute amount. Results from the enzyme analysis suggest that fishmeal is suitable as the main protein source for Florida pompano larvae compared to <b>krill</b> <b>meal.</b> This study gives new insights on Florida pompano early nutritional requirements and demonstrated the full functionality of the pancreas at 16 days post hatch, opening possibilities of an earlier weaning time...|$|E

However, the aquaculture industry has expanded greatly in recent decades, increasing demand for fishmeal (FM) and fish oil (FO) for fish feed, while {{the supply of}} fish raw materials has remained static or declined. This has created a need for alternative sustainable raw materials for fish feeds. This thesis examined the effect of replacing FM or FO with alternative plant (vegetable oils (VO), sesamin), microbial (zygomycete-, yeast fungi) and marine (krill, mussel) raw materials on growth performance, lipid content, fatty acid composition, lipid classes and fish metabolism in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). There was a significant negative effect on growth performance when sesamin, zygomycete fungi and extracted yeast were included in fish diets. Replacement of FM or FO with alternative materials affected the lipid profile in fish tissues, e. g. compared with the control, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) level was higher in fish fed <b>krill</b> <b>meal</b> and mussel meal and lower in fish fed VO, but unaffected in fish fed extracted and non-extracted yeast and sesamin.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. The {{purpose of}} this work was to develop {{effective}} technologies for commercial aquaculture of the Hawaiian limpet Cellana spp., known as opihi in Hawaiʻi. In this dissertation, {{our aim was to}} complete the life cycle of the yellow foot opihi Cellana sandwicensis. The first objective was to learn how to collect and develop an appropriate handling technique to maintain wild opihi to be used in feeding trials and also for breeding stock. The first collection trial showed a 58 % mortality, presumably due to injuries to animals while removing them from the rock. There was additional mortality of 42 % during transfer from one tank to another because they clung tightly onto the tank's wall. We were eventually able to achieve a minimum collection mortality of 30 % by being careful, however, it may be overestimated due to varying collection conditions. A holding system using plastic liners and soft plastic container led to zero mortalities due to handling in the subsequent trials. The next objective was to develop a commercial feed available for opihi. The analysis of the stomach contents found that benthic diatoms were the preferred feed in the wild and experimental feed trials on benthic ditoms called "biofilm" grown in the laboratory found that the opihi fed well at 0. 47 % dry matter/body weight/day (DM/BW/day) and survived well on it. Biofilm was the key to feed consumption when it was incorporated into artificial feed. While biofilm worked well as a maintenance diet, it is a natural feed that needed to be cultured and was unreliable over the long term. We found that a commercial preparation of the algae Porphyra commonly known as Nori was as attractive as biofilm and was an effective replacement for biofilm as a feeding stimulant. A formulated diet of fishmeal, soybean meal and <b>krill</b> <b>meal</b> including Porphyra produced the best growth rates (0. 44 ± 0. 37 %/day) and feed intake (0. 73 ± 0. 53 % DM/BW/day) over 10 weeks. Addition of <b>krill</b> <b>meal</b> combined with Porphyra into the diet produced a higher feeding rate (about 5 times) and promoted a significantly higher growth rate than those diets without <b>krill</b> <b>meal.</b> Among the experimental dietary protein levels from 21 % to 50 % and carbohydrate levels ranging from 18 % to 37 % diets were tested. Weight gain and specific growth rates of opihi increased with increasing dietary protein from 21 % diet and reached to maximum at the 35 % diet, and significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased at the 50 %. The fastest growth rates of animals were obtained with 27 % (0. 27 % day- 1) and 32 % (0. 26 % day- 1) and werer significantly higher than 18 % and 37 % carbohydrate diets. We conclude that about 35 % protein and 32 % carbohydrate levels could be used for opihi and could be a model for aquatic herbivores. Monthly measurement of gonadosomatic index (GSI) and histology analysis of the gonad of the animals found that the peak spawning season for opihi occurs from November to December and seems to extend to January. The non-reproductive season is proposed to take place from late February to early September, followed by a final maturation phase which occurs in October. This finding provided an important exogenous key factor for developing an affective induction of opihi gonad maturation in the laboratory. Final maturation was successfully induced by adding ARA (arachidonic acid) into the diet at an ARA/EPA (ecosapentaenoic acid) ratio of 0. 70. The GSI values of opihi reached to final maturation stage of 24. 5 % and 23. 7 % for 0. 24 % ARA and 0. 39 % ARA diets respectively, and were significantly higher than GSI of opihi (6. 11 %) that were fed with the control diet without supplementation of ARA after 75 days. Poor reproductive performance was obtained when the animals were exposed to the wrong natural photoperiod. Another trial using salmon gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue (sGnRHa) at dose of 250 ng/g BW, at 7 day intervals during the reproductive photoperiod produced final maturation after 3 injections. Spawning induction by using sGnRHa at dose of 1, 000 ng/g BW was an effective technique than hydrogen peroxide (0. 6 x 10 - 2 %) and was considered the most practical method because no mortality occurred after spawning. Embryonic and larval development of C. sandwicensis occurred rapidly. The larvae hatched in 12 - 14 hr after fertilization and subsequently achieved metamorphic competence at two days old. Larval rearing was attempted to test the survival and possible settlement and metamorphosis on different diatoms and pelagic algae but failed at Day 9. We speculate that larval mortality after Day 9 could be caused by unsuitable benthic diatoms. This led to the incomplete life cycle of the opihi in the laboratory, due to mortality of the settled larvae. More work is needed to determine if our maturation methods are truly effective, on spawning techniques to improve seed production and larval rearing in order to complete the life cycle of opihi to make sustainable aquaculture of opihi possible in the future...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the first}} {{experiment}} {{the effects of}} rotifer enrichment and feeding frequency on larval performance of red porgy Pagrus pagrus were studied. Larvae (2 days post-hatching= 2 dph) were fed s-type rotifers (∼ 20 rotifers/mL) enriched {{with one of the}} four different treatment media: Rotifer Diet (microalgae Nannochloropsis oculata and Tetraselmis chuii), DHA Protein Selco, Algamac 3000 (Schizochytrium sp.) and Algamac+ARA (arachidonic acid). Larvae were fed daily at full ration or twice daily at half ration. Larval growth and survival (mean= 22. 8 %) were satisfactory through 16 dph under all treatments; however, resistance to hyposaline challenge (Survival Activity Index=SAI) was positively correlated (P< 0. 01) with DHA concentration of rotifers, and SAI appeared highest in the Algamac+ARA treatment. In the second experiment the effects of Artemia enrichment on larval performance were compared from 18 dph through pre-metamorphosis (33 dph). Larvae were fed Artemia (0. 5 – 3. 0 /mL) enriched with two different media Algamac 3000 and DC DHA Selco, or unenriched Artemia (control). Both media improved DHA levels in Artemia and growth and survival (36. 7 – 54. 6 %) of larvae, while larvae fed unenriched Artemia showed poor growth and survival (5. 2 %). In the third experiment a University of North Carolina Wilmington microbound diet (MBD) and two commercial microdiets (Gemma Micro and Otohime) were evaluated.

Beginning 16 dph, live feeds and microdiets were co-fed to three treatment groups of larvae: (1) Gemma, (2) MBD, and (3) Otohime.

40|$|Introduction of {{formulated}} diet particles for larval culture will simplify hatchery protocols {{and promote}} consistent survival, while decreasing total operating costs. The blue swimmer crab, Portunus pelagicus, is a commercially important species with substantial aquaculture potentials in the Indo-Pacific region. Feeding trials aimed at investigating protein nutrition of P. pelagicus larvae were undertaken with the megalopae instar. Microbound diets (MBD) with four different dietary protein sources (fish meal, squid meal, <b>krill</b> <b>meal</b> and soybean meal) were formulated and fed to newly molted megalopae until they metamorphosed {{to the first}} crab stage. Thirty megalopae were reared individually for each dietary treatment, {{with the addition of}} two control treatments of megalopae fed live Artemia nauplii and an unfed treatment. Survival was high for all fed treatments (73. 3 - 93. 3 %), while total mortality was recorded for the unfed control. Megalopae fed the fish meal based MBD demonstrated higher survival than that of megalopea fed live Artemia, suggesting that MBD have the potential to completely replace live food for the culture of P. pelagicus megalopae without adversely affecting their survival. These results also suggest that P. pelagicus megalopae are able to adapt to a range of dietary protein sources. For megalopae fed live Artemia nauplii, mean development time was significantly shorter (4. 0 ± 0. 4  days) and the mean carapace width and dry weight of newly settled first stage crabs were significantly greater, (3. 1 ± 0. 0  mm, 1. 3 ± 0. 1  mg, respectively) than megalopae in all other fed treatments. Among MBD treatments, no significant difference in mean development time was detected, however, the mean carapace width of crabs that metamorphosed from megalopae fed fish meal based MBD (2. 8 ± 0. 0  mm) was larger than those fed squid meal based MBD (2. 6 ± 0. 0  mm) and the mean dry weight of individuals fed fish meal based MBD (0. 87 ± 0. 04  mg) was also significantly heavier than those fed soybean meal based MBD (0. 72 ± 0. 04  mg). The outcome of this research provides valuable information regarding protein requirements of P. pelagicus megalopae and will aid in optimising formulated diet particles for potential use in commercial hatcheries. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|Diets of many cultured fishes require high {{inclusion}} of fishmeal and fish oil. With {{the growth of}} aquaculture worldwide, demand for fishmeal and fish oil has increased resulting in higher prices of these ingredients due to increased demand but relatively static supplies. A promising source of alternative protein and lipid is the waste from seafood processing. This project evaluated four different types of seafood processing wastes as potential feed ingredients for the red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) and hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis x M. chysops). Viscera and skeletal remains from filleted channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), black drum (Pogonias cromis), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and krill (Euphausia superba) were evaluated with red drum and hybrid striped bass by determining nutrient and energy digestibility. Catfish, black drum, and tuna waste products were blended with soybean meal in a 40 : 60 ratio. All diets were subjected to dry extrusion, and then dried to produce stable ingredients. Diets used for the digestibility trial were formulated to contain 40 % crude protein, 10 % lipid and 1 % chromic oxide as a marker, with each ingredient substituted in a reference diet at a 30 : 70 ratio. The yellowfin tuna fillet waste also was evaluated in a comparative feeding trial with juvenile red drum. In that trial, experimental diets with the tuna by-product meal replaced menhaden fishmeal on an equal protein basis at levels of 5, 10, 20, 40 or 60 %. Diets were formulated to contain 40 % crude protein and 12 % lipid. Juvenile red drum were fed the various diets for 7 weeks in 38 -L aquaria linked as a brackish (6 + 1 ppt) water recirculating system. Apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) values for crude protein, crude lipid, and energy from krill and catfish meal were similar for red drum while the black drum meal had decisively lower values. <b>Krill</b> <b>meal</b> had higher ADC values for organic matter and energy than catfish meal and black drum meal in hybrid striped bass. ADC values of crude protein, and crude lipid were similar for krill, catfish, and black drum ingredients.

40|$|Formulated ‘artificial’ diets {{have the}} {{potential}} to overcome inherent nutritional and financial drawbacks associated with live foods used for larvae fish culture. Artificial formulations also provide a vehicle for accurate manipulation of nutritional constituents, enabling investigations into the nutrient requirements of fish larvae. In order to develop species-specific larval food formulations, optimal macronutrient requirements and appropriate nutrient sources must be established. The nutritional value of a food ingredient is determined by its nutritional profile and nutrient availability, and therefore nutrient digestibility {{is an essential part of}} the evaluation of novel food ingredients. Since the proteolytic capacity of barramundi larvae is limited, optimal sources of dietary protein must be established to optimise both their amino acid profile, and protein digestibility. An integrated approach was therefore adopted in this study to evaluate protein sources for barramundi larvae in terms of their amino acid profile and digestibility and in their capacity to support optimal growth and survival when incorporated into food formulations. Furthermore, the endocrinal mediation of the nutritional control of growth is investigated through thyroid hormone analysis, and nutritional effects on digestive physiology are examined through pepsin development. The thyrotropic hormone system is a major regulatory mechanism for the control of growth in teleosts. Thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine, T 3 and L-thyroxine, T 4) mediate extrinsic processes, such as nutrition, to regulate growth in juvenile and adult fish, and are regulated by nutritional quality and quantity. While thyroid hormones regulate growth, survival, development and metamorphosis in fish larvae, data are lacking on an endocrine-nutrition link at the larval stage. By applying an endocrinal approach to the nutritional control of growth, we may achieve a better understanding of the underlying processes governing the physiological status of fish. The research described in this thesis was therefore designed to clarify the quantitative and qualitative protein requirement of barramundi, Lates calcarifer, larvae, and to investigate possible nutritional links to thyroid hormone concentration. Dietary protein and energy contents were initially manipulated in larval food formulations to determine baseline macronutrient inclusion levels. Barramundi larvae (14 days after hatch, DAH) were fed microbound diets (MBD), varying in gross dietary protein (45, 50 and 55 %) and energy (18 and 21 MJ. kg- 1) for a period of 14 days. All fish were then sacrificed, measured for total length and a sub-sample taken for dry weight analysis. Carcass T 3 and T 4 were measured by radioimmunoassay, following chloroform/NH 3 OH extraction. In following experiments, marine animal meals (fish meal, squid powder, Artemia meal, mussel meal, prawn meal and <b>krill</b> <b>meal)</b> were evaluated for their suitability for inclusion into MBD for barramundi larvae. Each of these meals was included in dietary formulations to a total of 50 % gross protein. These formulations were evaluated in terms of growth and survival of barramundi larvae, amino acid composition of protein sources, protein digestibility and resulting carcass thyroid hormone levels. To improve the limited digestibility of fish meal, subsequent experiments incorporated fish meal hydrolysates and acid-denatured fish meal into MBD for evaluation in growth trials with barramundi larvae. An optimal diet was found to contain at least 21 MJ. kg- 1 dietary energy and derived its protein from a combination of fish meal and squid powder (9 : 1 ratio). The limited digestibility of fish meal was improved approximately two-fold by acid denaturation, and the moderate inclusion of denatured fish meal into food formulations improved larval growth significantly, while the entire replacement of untreated fish meal with denatured fish meal did not improve growth above that of diets containing intact fish meal. The reasons for this are unclear, though carcass pepsin level was depressed for larvae fed the formulation containing no intact fish meal, indicating that larvae may adapt to less digestible protein sources. The high leaching rates typically attributed to MBD are assumed to be responsible for the poor growth and/or survival of larvae fed diets containing autolysates and hydrolysates in this study. Thyroid hormone levels had no direct correlation to dietary energy level, protein source or protein inclusion level, though T 4 correlated with growth independently of these nutritional manipulations. This finding indicates that T 4 is important in the growth process of barramundi larvae, but is not directly mediated by specific nutritional inputs. This study developed a microbound diet which supported up to 58 % survival and significant growth in barramundi larvae from 14 - 28 DAH. The diet that supported the best rates of growth and survival contained 21 MJ. kg- 1 utilisable dietary energy and at least 50 % dietary protein, comprised of a 9 : 1 ratio of fish meal to squid powder. This study utilised integrated methodology to improve diet composition to increase growth and survival in barramundi larvae fed MBD, and to investigate the underlying mechanisms behind growth promotion. Growth trials remain the most conclusive way to determine optimal nutrient requirements for formulated foods, however, biochemical composition and physical properties can be used to narrow-down the wide range of nutrient sources available. Digestibility is of critical importance to the study of protein sources in food formulations for fish larvae, and a major area for the improvement of native animal meal protein sources. The diet developed in this study is a critical step in the development of species-specific weaning and larval diets for barramundi. Amino acid profiles for optimal growth have been refined, and the digestibility of fish meal has been increased to improve larval growth, thus potentiating early weaning protocols and diminishing Artemia requirements. The development of co-feeding and weaning protocols with this diet is expected to increase growth through optimised amino acid profile and increased energy and fatty acid availability, while reducing costs in barramundi hatcheries through reduced Artemia requirements...|$|E
