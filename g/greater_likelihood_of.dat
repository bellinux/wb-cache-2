5|$|When {{there is}} more pollen applied to the stigma, more seeds are {{produced}} in the fruits and the fruits are larger with <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> maturation, an effect called xenia. Competitively grown specimens are therefore often hand-pollinated to maximize the number of seeds in the fruit, which increases the fruit size; this pollination requires skilled technique. Seedlessness is known to occur in certain cultivars of C.pepo.|$|E

5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine does not {{necessarily}} mean better sexual function; for example, people with injuries in the sacral region {{are less likely to be}} able to orgasm than those with injuries higher on the spine. Women with injuries above the sacral level have a <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{relative}} brightness (it {{is about a}} fifth as bright as Pluto), Makemake was not discovered until after many much fainter Kuiper belt objects. Most searches for minor planets are conducted relatively close to the ecliptic (the region of the sky that the Sun, Moon and planets appear to lie in, as seen from Earth), due to the <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> finding objects there. It probably escaped detection during the earlier surveys due to {{its relative}}ly high orbital inclination, {{and the fact that}} it was at its farthest distance from the ecliptic at the time of its discovery, in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E

40|$|We {{suggest that}} {{interactions}} with strangers at work influence the <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> depressive disorders, as {{they serve as}} an environmental stressor, which are {{a necessary condition for}} the onset of depression according to diathesis-stress models of depression. We examined a large dataset (N =  76, 563 in K =  196 occupations) from the German pension insurance program and the Occupational Information Network dataset on occupational characteristics. We used a multilevel framework with individuals and occupations as levels of analysis. We found that occupational environments influence employees' risks of depression. In line with the quotation that 'hell is other people' frequent conflictual contacts were related to <b>greater</b> <b>likelihoods</b> <b>of</b> depression in both males and females (OR =  1. 14, p<. 05). However, interactions with the public were related to <b>greater</b> <b>likelihoods</b> <b>of</b> depression for males but lower <b>likelihoods</b> <b>of</b> depression for females (ORintercation =  1. 21, p<. 01). We theorize that some occupations may involve interpersonal experiences with negative emotional tones that make functional coping difficult and increase the risk of depression. In other occupations, these experiences have neutral tones and allow for functional coping strategies. Functional strategies are more often found in women than in men...|$|R

Once out of the cage many enjoy running along their owners' arms, investigating pockets, or just sitting on the owner's lap and grooming. Some mice also tolerate gentle petting. Care must be taken as mice have poor eyesight and may try to lean too far over an edge and fall. Care must especially be taken when being handled by small children as they may be overly rough. Fancy mice very rarely bite except when hurt or very frightened. Biting behavior may result from improper handling, as mice are generally considered non-aggressive.

25|$|Laboratory {{evidence}} of increased inflammation combined with demographic features (male sex, age {{less than six}} months or greater than eight years) and incomplete response to IVIG therapy create a profile of a high-risk patient with Kawasaki disease. The likelihood that an aneurysm will resolve appears to be determined in large measure by its initial size, in which the smaller aneurysms have a <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> regression. Other factors are positively associated with the regression of aneurysms, including being younger than a year old at the onset of Kawasaki disease, fusiform rather than saccular aneurysm morphology, and an aneurysm location in a distal coronary segment. The highest rate of progression to stenosis occurs among those who develop large aneurysms. The worst prognosis occurs in children with giant aneurysms. This severe outcome may require further treatment such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, coronary artery stenting, bypass grafting, and even cardiac transplantation.|$|E
25|$|Smoking {{has also}} {{been linked to the}} {{development}} of cervical cancer. Smoking can increase the risk in women a few different ways, which can be by direct and indirect methods of inducing cervical cancer. A direct way of contracting this cancer is a smoker has a higher chance of CIN3 occurring which has the potential of forming cervical cancer. When CIN3 lesions lead to cancer, most of them have the assistance of the HPV virus, but that is not always the case, which is why it can be considered a direct link to cervical cancer. Heavy smoking and long-term smoking seem to have more of a risk of getting the CIN3 lesions than lighter smoking or not smoking at all. Although smoking has been linked to cervical cancer, it aids in the development of HPV which {{is the leading cause of}} this type of cancer. Also, not only does it aid in the development of HPV, but also if the woman is already HPV-positive, she is at an even <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> contracting cervical cancer.|$|E

25|$|A {{total of}} 890 Meteors {{were lost in}} RAF service (145 of these crashes {{occurring}} in 1953 alone), resulting {{in the deaths of}} 450 pilots. Contributory factors in the number of crashes were the poor brakes, failure of the landing gear, the high fuel consumption and consequent short flight endurance (less than one hour), causing pilots to run out of fuel, and difficult handling with one engine out due to the widely set engines. The casualty rate was exacerbated by the lack of ejection seats in early series Meteors; the ground-breaking high speed that the aircraft was capable of meant that, during the bailing out process, pilots were typically subject to high g forces hindering movement and the effect of slipstream winds; there was also a <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> the pilot striking the horizontal tailplane. Ejection seats would be fitted in the later F.8, FR.9, PR.10 and some experimental Meteors. The difficulty of bailing out of the Meteor has been noted by pilots during development, reporting several contributing design factors such as the limited size and relative position of the cockpit {{to the rest of the}} aircraft, and difficulty in using the two-lever jettisonable hood mechanism.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{study by}} Jenifer L. Bratter and Rosalind B. King {{conducted}} {{on behalf of}} the Education Resources Information Center examined whether crossing racial boundaries increased the risk of divorce. Using the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth (Cycle VI), the likelihood of divorce for interracial couples to that of same-race couples was compared. Comparisons across marriage cohorts revealed that, overall, interracial couples have higher rates of divorce, particularly for those that married during the late 1980s. The authors found that gender plays a significant role in interracial divorce dynamics: According to the adjusted models predicting divorce as of the 10th year of marriage, interracial marriages that are the most vulnerable involve White females and non-White males relative to White/White couples. White wife/Black husband marriages {{are twice as likely to}} divorce by the 10th year of marriage compared to White/White couples, while White wife/Asian husband marriages are 59% more likely to end in divorce compared to White/White unions. Conversely, White men/non-White women couples show either very little or no differences in divorce rates. Asian wife/White husband marriages show only 4% <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> divorce by the 10th year of marriage than White/White couples. In the case of Black wife/White husband marriages, divorce by the 10th year of marriage is 44% less likely than among White/White unions. Intermarriages that did not cross a racial barrier, which was the case for White/Hispanic White couples, showed statistically similar likelihoods of divorcing as White/White marriages.|$|E
25|$|When {{males are}} fully mature {{they leave their}} webs {{to search for a}} {{suitable}} female, often using web characteristics to identify potential mates. Females are most likely to mate directly after their final molt at the beginning of adulthood and later in adulthood when they are feeding. There are often multiple males attempting to court the same female and thus competition for territory on the web occurs but is rarely physical as smaller males surrender area to larger ones. When males approach females they are often feeding, allowing the males to get closer without an aggressive response and also meaning the female is not moving. On approach the male makes himself known by tapping on a web strand to ensure the female is amenable before proceeding to mate. When met with aggression males will stop approaching and remain in the same location until the female relaxes or they retreat. Females engage in multiple mating but there is no benefit to the offspring as a result of this, however the energy cost of repelling a male is higher than that of allowing him to copulate. As a result of this sperm competition occurs through males altering the duration of mating as well as the frequency, longer mating is proportional to a <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> success. Sexual cannibalism is uncommon in Nephila as a result of male mating behaviours. By copulating when females are immobile after molting or inactive due to feeding the males increase their chances of survival. Males also approach {{on the opposite side of}} the web to the female making it more difficult to be caught. Sexual cannibalism does still occur and generally is more common in larger males and from older females.|$|E
