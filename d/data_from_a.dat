5|$|Mobile device {{forensics}} is a sub-branch {{of digital}} forensics relating to recovery of digital evidence or <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mobile device.

SMS <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mobile device investigation helped to exonerate Patrick Lumumba {{in the murder of}} Meredith Kercher.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June24, eventually emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on July7. An {{area of low pressure}} became discernible, and with <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> reconnaissance aircraft, {{the system was}} upgraded to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on July8. The depression failed to organize appreciably as it tracked west to west-northwest, moving ashore South Padre Island, Texas with winds of 35mph (55km/h) by 14:00UTC that day. The depression degenerated into a remnant low by 06:00UTC on July9 and dissipated over northern Mexico a day later.|$|E
5|$|After {{nearly two}} weeks of inactivity, an area of {{disturbed}} weather developed in the Bay of Campeche and quickly became better organized. It was designated Tropical Depression Two {{on the evening of}} June 28, and, two hours later, <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicated that it had strengthened into a tropical storm, at which point the system was named Bret. This {{was the first time that}} two tropical storms had formed in June since the 1986 season, and only the thirteenth time since 1851.|$|E

5|$|Both {{direct and}} {{indirect}} ways {{have been found to}} indicate the presence of a wake depression. The most direct is through the use of surface observations. Prior to the development of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, it was difficult to locate wake lows. With the advent of mesoscale networks, wake lows have become easier to detect. On weather satellite and weather radar imagery, wake lows and heat bursts normally occur on the rear side of a precipitation area. However, within larger precipitation areas, they can be located within the area showing a minimum of returns. When using velocity <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> WSR-88D doppler radar, high winds on the back edge of reflectivity data can give away the location of a wake low.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{relatively}} unfavorable vertical {{wind shear}} impacting Colin, deep thunderstorm activity developed atop its center of circulation. <b>Data</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> reconnaissance aircraft {{during the afternoon}} hours of August5 revealed that the system reached a peak intensity with winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1005mbar (29.68inHg). A few computer models, namely the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model (HWRF), predicted that Colin would briefly attain hurricane status.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent {{analyses}} {{called the}} original landing zone estimate into question: Scott, who was flying the aircraft manually because of Cooper's speed and altitude demands, later determined that his flight path was significantly farther east than initially assumed. Additional <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> variety of sources—in particular Continental Airlines pilot Tom Bohan, who was flying four minutes behind Flight 305—indicated {{that the wind}} direction factored into drop zone calculations had been wrong, possibly {{by as much as}} 80 degrees. This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual drop zone was probably south-southeast of the original estimate, in the drainage area of the Washougal River.|$|E
5|$|The ATA Secure Erase {{command is}} {{designed}} to remove all user <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> drive. With an SSD without integrated encryption, this command will put the drive back to its original out-of-box state. This will initially restore its performance to the highest possible level and the best (lowest number) possible write amplification, {{but as soon as}} the drive starts garbage collecting again the performance and write amplification will start returning to the former levels. Many tools use the ATA Secure Erase command to reset the drive and provide a user interface as well. One free tool that is commonly referenced in the industry is called HDDErase. Gparted and Ubuntu live CDs provide a bootable Linux system of disk utilities including secure erase.|$|E
5|$|The next NASA {{astronaut}} {{to stay on}} Mir was Michael Foale. Foale and Russian {{mission specialist}} Elena Kondakova boarded Mir from Atlantis on mission STS-84. The STS-84 crew transferred 249 items between the two spacecraft, along with water, experiment samples, supplies and hardware. One of the first items transferred to Mir was an Elektron oxygen-generating unit. Atlantis was stopped three times while backing away during the undocking sequence on May 21. The aim was to collect <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> European sensor device designed for future rendezvous of ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) with the International Space Station.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Cindy {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} wave that departed the western coast of Africa on August8, 1993. Over the following days, the wave tracked steadily west-northwestward across the tropical Atlantic while retaining a distinct cloud pattern on satellite images. Although initial <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> reconnaissance aircraft mission on August13 indicated that the system lacked a defined wind circulation, a second mission at 12:00UTC the next day revealed an improvement in its structure at the lower levels of the atmosphere. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) thus classified the system as a tropical depressiona tropical cyclone with sustained winds of less than 39mph (62km/h)and initiated public advisories on it soon thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The sensor {{transmitters}} would relay {{their data}} to the second element of the system, an orbiting EC-121R aircraft of the Air Force's 553rd Reconnaissance Wing, based at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base. The EC-121s would then relay the collected information via a radio link at 2200 to 2300 MHz to Nakhon Phanom. At Task Force Alpha, {{the last of the}} three components in the system, the intelligence <b>data</b> (<b>from</b> <b>a</b> variety of sources, not just the sensors) would be entered, collated, retrieved, and stored by two IBM 360/40 (later two 360/65) computers. Technicians at the center controlled the system from a variety of video displays that were also linked to the computers.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Debra was {{the second}} of two {{tropical}} storms to hit the United States in the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season. The fourth named storm of the season, Debra developed from the interaction between a high-altitude cold low and a lower tropical wave in the Gulf of Mexico. Forming on August 25, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Debra based on <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Hurricane Hunter aircraft. As Debra approached the coast, it attained peak winds of 60mph (95km/h). The storm made landfall {{on the coast of}} Louisiana, east of the Texas border. Two deaths were caused by the storm. Debra weakened as it moved inland and ultimately dissipated on August29 over Arkansas.|$|E
