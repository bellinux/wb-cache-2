2500|$|The final painting, Old Age, is {{an image}} of death. The man has grown old; he has survived the trials of life. The waters have calmed; the river flows into the waters of eternity. The figurehead and {{hourglass}} are missing from the battered boat; the withered old voyager has {{reached the end of}} earthly time. In the distance, angels are descending from heaven, while the guardian angel hovers close, <b>gesturing</b> <b>toward</b> the others. The man is once again joyous with the knowledge that faith has sustained him through life. The landscape is practically gone, just a few rough rocks represent the edge of the earthly world, and dark water stretches onward. Cole describes the scene: [...] "The chains of corporeal existence are falling away; and already the mind has glimpses of Immortal Life." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{argument}} {{has been made}} that Albert Brooks, who was 11 years old when Einstein died, has dealt with the trauma of his father's passing through vignettes in his movies. For example, early in Defending Your Life (1991), Brooks’s recently deceased character, Albert, finds himself in an afterlife nightclub, watching a terrible comedian. “How’d you die?” the comic asks him; Albert replies, “Onstage, like you.” Later, Meryl Streep's character invites Albert to leave with her. “I can’t,” he says, <b>gesturing</b> <b>toward</b> the stage. “That’s my father.” ...|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} taken from the grandstands behind home plate, off to the third base side. One can clearly see Ruth's gesture, {{although}} it is hard to determine the angle of his pointing. Some contend Ruth's extended arm is pointing more to the left field direction, toward the Cubs bench, which would be consistent with his (continued) <b>gesturing</b> <b>toward</b> the bench while rounding the bases after the hit. Others who have studied the film closely assert that in addition to the broader gestures, Ruth did make a quick finger point in the direction of Cubs pitcher Charlie Root, or center field just as Root was winding up.|$|E

Someone near the apex of the bridge lowers a rope to the outstretched arms of the crew below. In addition to the shops and diners, there are inns, temples, private residences, and official buildings varying in grandeur and style, from huts to mansions with grand front- and backyards.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the use of sensory modalities relative to a partner’s behavior in gesture sequences during captive chimpanzee play at the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute. We hypothesized that chimpanzees would use visual <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> attentive recipients and auditory/tactile <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> inattentive recipients. We also hypothesized that gesture sequences would be more prevalent toward unresponsive rather than responsive recipients. The chimpanzees used significantly more auditory/tactile rather than visual gestures first in sequences with both attentive and inattentive recipients. They rarely used visual <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> inattentive recipients. Auditory/tactile gestures were effective with and used with both attentive and inattentive recipients. Recipients responded significantly more to single gestures than to first gestures in sequences. Sequences often indicated that recipients {{did not respond to}} initial gestures, whereas effective single gestures made more gestures unnecessary. The chimpanzees thus gestured appropriately relative to a recipient’s behavior and modified their interactions according to contextual social cues...|$|R

5000|$|The play explores {{themes of}} mixed race as both an {{aesthetic}} challenge {{and a social}} concern, <b>gesturing</b> <b>toward</b> a poetics of social justice for the “mulatto millennium” as well as art as both social memory and cultural production. Influenced by Euripides' play The Bacchae, the entire play is held {{in the ruins of}} a museum of Greek antiquities, and has characters inspired by the Socratic dialogues (Phaedo, Crito, Meno, Apollodorus, and Ion) written by Plato, which attempts to determine the definition of virtue and the meaning of art. TALK also delves heavily in theoretical arguments regarding the reading of performativity as interdisciplinary concepts [...] by examining the works of André Breton, Clay Felker, Mark Van Doren, Jonas Mekas, James Baldwin, Wayne Shorter, Jack Kerouac, Maya Deren and Robert Giroux (among others) [...] with clips from an alleged unfinished experimental film ( [...] heavily influenced by the French New Wave and Maya Deren's expressionism) 1made by Aymes, shown and narrated by Phaedo, one of his collaborators.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This study {{examined}} the use of sensory modalities relative to a partner’s behavior in gesture sequences during captive chimpanzee play at the Chim-panzee and Human Communication Institute. We hypoth-esized that chimpanzees would use visual <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> attentive recipients and auditory/tactile <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> inattentive recipients. We also hypothesized that gesture sequences would be more prevalent toward unresponsive rather than responsive recipients. The chimpanzees used significantly more auditory/tactile rather than visual ges-tures first in sequences with both attentive and inattentive recipients. They rarely used visual <b>gestures</b> <b>toward</b> inat-tentive recipients. Auditory/tactile gestures were effective with and used with both attentive and inattentive recipients. Recipients responded significantly more to single gestures than to first gestures in sequences. Sequences often indi-cated that recipients {{did not respond to}} initial gestures, whereas effective single gestures made more gestures unnecessary. The chimpanzees thus gestured appropriately relative to a recipient’s behavior and modified their inter-actions according to contextual social cues...|$|R

5000|$|While {{making his}} entrance, Ottman tripped over {{a piece of}} lumber that was framing the set, causing him to fall forward through the wall with his helmet falling off and sliding across the floor. His face accidentally exposed, he {{scrambled}} to put the helmet back on as Vicious, restraining laughter, exclaimed [...] "Oh, God!" [...] Ottman donned the helmet and got back on his feet, shifting his weight and dusting his hands off {{in an attempt to}} shrug off the gaffe while Harlem Heat's Kole asked, [...] "Who is this motherfucker?" [...] and Smith exclaimed [...] "He fell flat on his arse!". Both of these comments were audible to the live audience and television viewers, but were bleeped in future showings of the footage by WWE. Ottman then began <b>gesturing</b> <b>toward</b> his would-be opponents several seconds before a menacing gravelly off-screen voice (provided by Ole Anderson) started to threaten Sid and Vader. Sid Vicious reacted in rage to Shockmaster, and the broadcast focused on Vicious {{for the duration of the}} voiceover. The announcers said nothing as the segment ended.|$|E
50|$|When an {{observer}} first views this painting {{the eye is}} immediately drawn to {{the figure in the}} bottom right corner wearing a blue and black headdress facing left with a profile view. This figure (which covers about one fourth of the canvas) is watching others carry pots on their heads. These silhouette-type figures are also <b>gesturing</b> <b>toward</b> a glowing star in the top left corner, or they are holding hands while looking towards a city in the top right corner. All are moving to an elevated position in the painting, the city in the top right corner is composed of two big buildings where there are two entertainers in front; one is playing the piano while the other seems to be preparing to sing because there are music notes around him. Then, behind these two big buildings there’s a big round yellow circular object protruding from the side, surrounded by two blue/turquoise concentric circles. It has a face, and someone on a bended knee appearing to be acting on top of it. The turquoise colored circle bigger than the previous one has a face coming out towards the inside. Further up there’s someone painting on top of the blue circle with the words art above enclosed within the blue circle. A symbolic palette and brush are painted within that same blue circle, the star in the top left corner has rays of squiggly blue, green, and black streaks that radiate diagonally. The star is inside of a yellow circle shining down on the people gesturing towards it, this picture reflects what Jones was trying to convey to her audience.|$|E

30|$|The {{diagonal}} connecting true and not-true reveals {{their common}} {{concern with the}} limits of representation. At the positive (“true”) end of the diagonal, the limits imply that we cannot speak the truth. At the negative (“not-true”) end, they paradoxically perform the positive function of <b>gesturing</b> <b>toward</b> that which cannot be spoken. Elusive negativity, precisely because of its doubly negative position, opens onto the flux that cannot be represented in itself (Hayles [1991] 1997).|$|E
