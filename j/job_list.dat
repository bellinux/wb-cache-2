5000|$|When a login session ends, via {{explicit}} logout or network disconnection, all processes, including background processes, will {{by default}} be terminated, {{to prevent them}} from becoming orphan processes. Concretely, when the user exits the launching shell process, as part of shutdown it sends a hangup signal (SIGHUP) to all its jobs, to terminate all the processes in the corresponding process group. To have processes continue to run, one can either not end the session, or end the session without terminating the processes. A terminal multiplexer can be used to leave a session running but detach a virtual terminal from it, leaving processes running as child processes of the session; the user can then reattach session later. Or, termination can be prevented by either starting the process via the nohup command (telling the process to ignore SIGHUP), or by subsequently running [...] with the job id, which either removes the job from the <b>job</b> <b>list</b> entirely, or simply prevents SIGHUP from being sent. In the latter case when the session ends, the child processes are not terminated, either because they are not sent SIGHUP or because they ignore it, and thus become orphan processes, which are then adopted by the init process (the kernel sets the init process as their parent), and they continue running without a session, now called daemons.|$|E

The worst case performance ratiosoftheLS algorithm are analyzed. The objective {{function is to}} minimize the maximum completion time of all machines, i. e. the makespan. If the <b>job</b> <b>list</b> has a nondecreasing release times, then 2 − 1 m is the tight bound of the worst case performance ratio of the LS algorithm. If the <b>job</b> <b>list</b> has non-increasing processing times, we show that 2 − 1 2 m is an upper bound of the worst case performance ratio of the LS algorithm. Furthermore if the <b>job</b> <b>list</b> has non-decreasing release times and the <b>job</b> <b>list</b> has non-increasing processing times we prove that the LS algorithm has worst case performance ratio not greater than 3...|$|E

All job requests are saved in a “linked list” containing its first time that it was originally entered as job request and a basic description. One reason to use the linked list is to provide primary benefit of limiting memory waste as insertion, and removal of data constantly takes place. ICM processes job requests in order, from head to tail which means in our case that we used a first-in-first-out (FIFO) job selection process. We will explain details about experimental system settings in the following section.|$|E

40|$|Execution of {{simulation}} programs requires {{large amounts}} of CPU resources. Parallel Independent Replications (PIR) is one method of reducing simulation run time by enabling time-based parallelization of simulations on multiple distributed machines. Existing PIR systems are targeted for Unix machines. A Windows-based program for distributing executables and their associated input and output files to idle Windows PCs is developed. Wintel PCs dominate desktop computing, therefore, providing hours of unused CPU cycles that can be exploited to accelerate simulation. The new REMOTE++ program uses standard remote shell (rsh) and remote copy (rcp) services to enable remote program execution and the transfer of input and output files. The remote computer needs only a standard rsh /rcp daemon available from independent software vendors. A single master computer maintains a <b>job</b> <b>list</b> and host list and distributes jobs (from the <b>job</b> <b>list)</b> to remote hosts (from the host list). Execution results are on the master computer {{at the completion of}} a remote execution. Status from remote executions is maintained in a log file on the master computer. The REMOTE++ program builds on a previous REMOTE version and improves reliability and performance. The REMOTE++ program was used to investigate run time trends needed for steady state simulation of an M/M/ 1 queue at utilizations approaching 1. 0. It was found that as the utilization approaches 100 % the simulation time grows increasingly longer. The REMOTE++ program is open source and freely available from the authors...|$|E

40|$|In {{the vast}} {{optimization}} field, many computer-aided techniques were proposed and {{tested in the}} last decades. The artificial intelligence meta-heuristics constitute the widest part of such techniques, which proved to be adequate to (near) optimally solve big difficult instances, as the most real optimization problems are. Among them, the agent-based techniques are the most recent ones and they {{reported in the literature}} very good results compared to many other optimization methods. Such methods are: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Wasp Behavior Model (WBM) and negotiation techniques. In this paper a research study on ACO applicability to Job Shop Scheduling Problems (JSSP) is reported and a waiting time-based pheromone updating formula is proposed. This is tested on a simple JSSP case study using <b>job</b> <b>list</b> representation. The results show that ACO is able to optimally solve JSS optimization problems.

The total service time duration differences of the outcome drilling site clusters were minimized to a given accepted difference level by iteratively shifting jobs from the cluster, which has maximum total service time duration. The distance matrix of each drilling site locations cluster was modified by adding the ‘office location’ and replacing ‘big M’ values for main diagonal distances of each outcome cluster and, sent through the Hungarian method. The graphical representations of obtained sub routes were taken {{as a guide for}} designing of the shortest path of each clustered drilling sites.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{experiments}} with the manufacturing efficiency by layout change of a factory {{by means of}} agent-based autonomous production scheduling, using the virtual factory on a multi-agent simulation system. As infrastructure software for agent based simulation, the artisoc(c) is used. In this virtual factory, three types of agents are equipped. Users can alter a configuration such as input new jobs, adjusting a machine setting, etc, with monitoring conditions of agents. As a result, by adjustment of the agent's behavior with shop floor detail, the assembly schedule becomes more effective. The experiment is carried out to show that local negotiations contribute to global optimization when resources in the factory are effectively distributed and shared. In this paper, the effectiveness of job-list cleanup method is shown. In addition, the scheduling influence is simulated by the communication range of agents. A part agent chooses a machine, by {{the length of a}} <b>job</b> <b>list</b> and the conveyance cost. But the communication cost between agents increases with the size of the communication range. From experimental results, when extending the communication range simply, the conclusion is reached that optimization did not necessarily result in progress...|$|E
