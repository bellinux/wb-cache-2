500|$|In an interview, Khaled Hosseini explains, [...] "I {{was searching}} for English {{translations}} of poems about Kabul, {{for use in a}} scene where a character bemoans leaving his beloved city, when I found this particular verse. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> found not only the right line for the scene, but also an evocative title in the phrase 'a thousand splendid suns,' which appears in the next-to-last stanza." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{turning point}} for Mashinini came when she thought about how {{clothing}} produced in her factory was being used. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> personally helped to make these uniforms used for the slaughter of my people ... I felt horrified", she wrote in her autobiography. She resolved that union organising would always touch on larger political issues.|$|E
2500|$|I thought I {{had made}} it up. Then, rereading The Voyage of the Dawn Treader by C. S. Lewis, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{probably}} gotten it from the island of Terebinthia in that book. However, Lewis probably got that name from the Terebinth tree in the Bible, so both of us pinched from somewhere else, probably unconsciously." ...|$|E
5000|$|On July 27, 2005, Malar Balasubramaniam's {{brother and}} sister {{received}} an email from her. Parts of this email read, [...] "Once <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> won't succeed the way I wanted to in life and decided to end it, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> couldn't leave you two alone with Amma" [...] ("Amma" [...] means [...] "mother") and [...] "I'm sorry for what I did to Amma, I am, but I'm glad she's not here to hurt us anymore." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{next two}} records, The Spotlight Kid (simply {{credited}} to [...] "Captain Beefheart") and Clear Spot (credited to [...] "Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band"), were both released in 1972. The atmosphere of The Spotlight Kid is, {{according to one}} critic, [...] "definitely relaxed and fun, maybe one step up from a jam". And though [...] "things do sound maybe {{just a little too}} blasé", [...] "Beefheart at his worst still has something more than most groups at their best." [...] The music is simpler and slower than on the group's two previous releases, the uncompromisingly original Trout Mask Replica and the frenetic Lick My Decals Off, Baby. This was in part an attempt by Van Vliet to become a more appealing commercial proposition as the band had made virtually no money during the previous two years—at the time of recording, the band members were subsisting on welfare food handouts and remittances from their parents. Van Vliet offered that he [...] "got tired of scaring people with what I was doing... <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to give them something to hang their hat on, so I started working more of a beat into the music". Magic Band members have also said that the slower performances were due in part to Van Vliet's inability to fit his lyrics with the instrumental backing of the faster material on the earlier albums, a problem that was exacerbated in that he almost never rehearsed with the group. In the period leading up to the recording the band lived communally, first at a compound near Ben Lomond, California and then in northern California near Trinidad. The situation saw a return to the physical violence and psychological manipulation that had taken place during the band's previous communal residence while composing and rehearsing Trout Mask Replica. According to John French, the worst of this was directed toward Harkleroad. In his autobiography Harkleroad recalls being thrown into a dumpster, an act he interpreted as having metaphorical intent.|$|E

60|$|I was {{trembling}} with excitement {{as we went}} on, believing the time for our dangerous venture to be near at hand, and I prayed most fervently that the tempest which was seemingly gathering upon us, would burst before midnight. Then came a cold chill to my heart, as <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not had time to gather the skiffs as Hiram advised, because of having been occupied with showing him the best hiding places.|$|E
60|$|At {{about ten}} o'clock {{next morning we}} topped the scantily-timbered ridge which walls in the Lame Deer Agency, and looked down upon the tents of the troops. A company of cavalry {{drilling}} on the open field to the north gave evidence of active service, and as I studied the mingled huts and tepees of the village, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> arrived in time to witness {{some part of the}} latest staging of the red man's final stand.|$|E

60|$|Lying there <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come to {{love the}} silence, the loneliness, the serenity, even the tragedy of this valley of shadows. Death Valley was one place that could never be popular with men. It had been set apart for the hardy diggers for earthen treasure, and for the wanderers of the wastelands--men who go forth to seek and to find and to face their souls. Perhaps most of them found death. But there was a death in life. Desert {{travelers}} learned the secret that men lived {{too much in the}} world--that in silence and loneliness and desolation there was something infinite, something hidden from the crowd.|$|E

Our eyes met as she drove past and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> found my long-sought ideal. I rushed back to town and hunted up Pete Manderson at the club. Pete is a donkey but he has his ways of being useful. He told me who she was. Her name is Stephanie Gardiner; she is his cousin {{from the south and}} is visiting his mother. And, Freda, I am to dine at the Mandersons' tonight. I shall meet her." ...|$|E

He often walked about there in the evenings. It was a curious fad which he had. We called a cab, and he told the driver where to pull up. When I {{was sitting next to}} him, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a stick in my hand. I really had forgotten that it was Luke's. Whilst I toyed with it, I noticed that the top came out, and that a sharp dagger was concealed inside the body of the stick.|$|E

5000|$|.....in 1992 {{everything}} changed and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was living in}} a war in which sex was used as part of a war strategy to humiliate women and thereby cause the destruction of an ethnic group. 20,000 women were systematically raped in Bosnia during the war." ...|$|R

60|$|Throughout the {{afternoon}} the fight, kept on, {{the little black}} boats coming and going. I saw a mast totter and fall {{on one of the}} ships. I saw the flag shot away from the fort, and reappear again. But now the puffs came from her walls slowly and more slowly, so that my heart sank with the setting sun. And presently it grew too dark to see aught save the red flashes. Slowly, reluctantly, the noise died down until at last a great silence reigned, broken only now and again by voices in the streets below me. It was not until then that <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been all day without food--that I was alone in the dark of a great house.|$|E
60|$|In {{that hour}} I {{experienced}} {{a sense of}} desolation and a pain to which I {{find it difficult to}} give expression. It seemed to me as if she had gone out of my life for all time--as if no reparation that I could ever make would suffice to win her back after what had passed between us that morning. Already wounded in her pride by what Mademoiselle de Marsac had told her of our relations, my behaviour in the rose garden had completed the work of turning into hatred the tender feelings that but yesterday she had all but confessed for me. That she hated me now, I was well assured. My reflections as I walked had borne it in upon me how rash, how mad had been my desperate action, and with bitterness <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> destroyed the last chance of ever mending matters.|$|E
60|$|As I slowly {{recalled}} my collegiate {{studies and}} paleontological readings in Bowen's textbooks, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> looked upon {{nothing less than}} a diplodocus of the Upper Jurassic; but how infinitely different was the true, live thing from the crude restorations of Hatcher and Holland! I had had the idea that the diplodocus was a land-animal, but evidently it is partially amphibious. I have seen several since my first encounter, and in each case the creature took to the sea for concealment {{as soon as it was}} disturbed. With the exception of its gigantic tail, it has no weapon of defense; but with this appendage it can lash so terrific a blow as to lay low even a giant cave-bear, stunned and broken. It is a stupid, simple, gentle beast--one of the few within Caspak which such a description might even remotely fit.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> think <b>that</b> up to <b>that</b> moment <b>I</b> {{had never}} {{experienced}} such a thrill as passed through me when <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was navigating these historic waters.
