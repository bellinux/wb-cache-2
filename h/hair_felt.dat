6000|$|Maisie glanced away {{over the}} apron of the cab--gazed a minute {{at the green}} expanse of the Regent's Park and, at this moment {{colouring}} {{to the roots of}} her <b>hair,</b> <b>felt</b> the full, hot rush of an emotion more mature than any she had yet known. It consisted of an odd unexpected shame at placing in an inferior light, to so perfect a gentleman and so charming a person as Sir Claude, so very near a relative as Mr. Farange. She remembered, however, her friend's telling her that no one was seriously afraid of her father, and she turned round with a small toss of her head. [...] "Oh I dare say I can manage him!" ...|$|E

It {{was one of the}} first times in a Western film where the villain would be played by the lead actor.|$|R
6000|$|This silent spot {{tradition}} old Had peopled {{with the}} spectral dead. For {{the roots of}} the speaker's <b>hair</b> <b>felt</b> cold And stiff, as with tremulous lips he told That a hellish shape at midnight led [...] 150 The ghost of a youth with hoary hair, And sate on the seat beside him there, Till a naked child came wandering by, When the fiend would change to a lady fair! A fearful tale! The truth was worse: [...] 155 For here a sister and a brother Had solemnized a monstrous curse, Meeting in this fair solitude: For beneath yon very sky, Had they resigned to one another [...] 160 Body and soul. The multitude: Tracking them to the secret wood, Tore limb from limb their innocent child, And stabbed and trampled on its mother; But the youth, for God's most holy grace, [...] 165 A priest saved to burn in the market-place.|$|E
60|$|Macheson {{thought of}} his friend's words later in the afternoon, when {{he stood on the}} {{slightly}} raised platform of the fashionable room where his lectures were given. Not a chair was empty. Macheson, as he entered, gazed long and steadily into those rows of tired, distinguished-looking faces, and felt in the atmosphere the delicate wave of perfume shaken from their clothes--the indescribable effect of femininity. There were men there, too, mostly as escorts, correctly dressed, bored, vacuous, from intent rather than lack of intelligence. Macheson himself, carelessly dressed from design, his fine figure ill-clad, with untidy boots and shock <b>hair,</b> <b>felt</b> his anger slowly rising as he marked the stir which his coming had caused. He to be the showman of such a crowd! It was maddening! That day he spoke to them without even the ghost of a smile parting his lips. He sought to create no sympathy. He cracked his whip with the cool deliberation of a Russian executioner.|$|E
6000|$|They {{walked slowly}} {{back to the}} fire. He made for her a seat out of the dry branches, and, {{throwing}} himself down at her feet, lay his head {{in her lap and}} gave himself up to the dreamy delight of the passing hour. Their voices rose and fell, tender or animated as they spoke of their love and of their future. She, with a few skilful words spoken from time to time, guided his thoughts, and he let his happiness flow in a stream of talk passionate and tender, grave or menacing, according to the mood which she evoked. He spoke to her of his own island, where the gloomy forests and the muddy rivers were unknown. He spoke of its terraced fields, of the murmuring clear rills of sparkling water that flowed down the sides of great mountains, bringing life to the land and joy to its tillers. And he spoke also of the mountain peak that rising lonely above the belt of trees knew the secrets of the passing clouds, and was the dwelling-place of the mysterious spirit of his race, of the guardian genius of his house. He spoke of vast horizons swept by fierce winds that whistled high above the summits of burning mountains. He spoke of his forefathers that conquered ages ago the island of which he was to be the future ruler. And then as, in her interest, she brought her face nearer to his, he, touching lightly the thick tresses of her long <b>hair,</b> <b>felt</b> a sudden impulse to speak to her of the sea he loved so well; and he told her of its never-ceasing voice, to which he had listened as a child, wondering at its hidden meaning that no living man has penetrated yet; of its enchanting glitter; of its senseless and capricious fury; how its surface was for ever changing, and yet always enticing, while its depths were for ever the same, cold and cruel, and full of the wisdom of destroyed life. He told her how it held men slaves of its charm for a lifetime, and then, regardless of their devotion, swallowed them up, angry at their fear of its mystery, which it would never disclose, not even to those that loved it most. While he talked, Nina's head had been gradually sinking lower, and her face almost touched his now. Her hair was over his eyes, her breath was on his forehead, her arms were about his body. No two beings could be closer to each other, yet she guessed rather than understood the meaning of his last words that came out after a slight hesitation in a faint murmur, dying out imperceptibly into a profound and significant silence: [...] "The sea, O Nina, is like a woman's heart." ...|$|E

40|$|Background : The {{aspect of}} hair {{depends on the}} spatial {{organization}} of the hair shafts and on their chemical, physical and structural integrity. Some genetic disorders and exogenous influences may affect it. Aims : In vivo objective assessments are welcome in order to compare the consequences of hair damages and to assess the kinetics of the changes occurring in time after damaging or attempting to repair the hair structure. Method : Ultrasound shear wave propagation measured on hair is introduced as an objective non-invasive method with in vitro and in vivo applications. Results : With multiple measurements made on the scalp of 72 Caucasians, <b>hair</b> <b>felting</b> following damage appeared {{to be associated with}} an increase in the coefficient of variation of the shear wave velocity measurements. Maximum hydration of hair locks increased the shear wave velocity in vitro and decreased the intraindividual range of data. The relevance of the method and reproducibility of data was influenced by the experimentalist skill. Conclusion : Ultrasound shear wave propagation on hair is influenced by the physical integrity of the hair shafts and on their three-dimensional arrangement...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally it {{was made}} from rabbit <b>hair</b> <b>felt,</b> but now is usually made from other materials, such as tweed, straw, wool and wool/nylon blends. The hat reached its zenith of common {{popularity}} in the 1960s; the lower head clearance in American automobiles made it impractical to wear a hat with a tall crown while driving. It faded from popularity in the 1970s when any type of men's headwear went out of fashion, and men's fashion instead began focusing on highly maintained hairstyles.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the term [...] "Buffalo Soldier" [...] is theorized as given to black troops by Native Americans, who thought African Americans' <b>hair</b> <b>felt</b> and looked like a buffalo's pelt.

The Buffalo Soldier's duties were settling railroad disputes, building telegraph lines, repairing and building forts, helping settlers {{find a place to}} live, and protecting the settlers from Native Americans attacks.|$|E

40|$|Renal cell carcinoma, which {{accounts}} for 85 % of all kidney cancers, is among the ten leading malignancies in industrialized countries. To identify occupational risk factors for cancer, a multi-site case-control {{study was conducted in}} Montreal; renal cell carcinoma was one of the sites. A total of 142 cases of renal cell cancer and 2, 433 controls were interviewed in this study. Complete occupation histories were obtained, and a team of industrial hygienists and chemists estimated each subject's exposure to a list of industrial substances. Statistical analyses were carried out to estimate the association between renal cell cancer and each non-occupational and occupational variable. Among non-occupational variables collected and analysed, increased risks were observed for highest level of body mass index (BMI) and a previous history of hypertension. Negative associations were found for tea and coffee consumption. Increased risks were found in the following industries: printing related service, laundries, military, wholesale and retail trade industries. Increased risks were found in the following occupations: managers, plumbers, welders, printers, nursery workers, and aircraft mechanics. Exposure to the following substances significantly increased the risks for renal cell carcinoma: <b>hair</b> dust, <b>felt</b> dust, styrene-butadiene rubber, ozone, hydrogen sulphide, inorganic acid solution, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, jet fuel, aviation gasoline, jet fuel engine emissions, ink, chromium compounds, and ultraviolet radiation. The above findings were not adjusted for mutual confounding. After adjustment for known risk factors using multivariate logistic regression models, one non-occupational and several occupational risk factors were associated with renal cell carcinoma. These were: high BMI, asbestos, <b>hair</b> dust, <b>felt</b> dust, styrene-butadiene rubber, ozone, exposed to any of jet fuel, aviation gasoline, and jet fuel engine emission, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and ultraviole...|$|R

60|$|Opposite to this lady, {{and with}} her face fully tamed to me, was a kindly-looking, fat motherly woman, with light-coloured hair, {{not in the best}} order. She was hot and scarlet with exercise, being perhaps too stout for the steep steps of the fortress; and in one hand she held a handkerchief, with which from time to time she wiped her brow. In the other hand she held one of the {{extremities}} of my friend's property, feeling--good, careful soul!--what was the texture of the cloth. As she did so, I could see a glance of approbation pass across her warm features. I liked that lady's face, in spite of her untidy <b>hair,</b> and <b>felt</b> that had she been alone my friend would not have been injured.|$|R
60|$|Tito, {{instead of}} meeting Romola's glance, {{closed his eyes}} and rubbed his hands over his face and <b>hair.</b> He <b>felt</b> he was {{behaving}} unlike himself, but he would make amends to-morrow. The terrible resurrection of secret fears, which, if Romola had known them, would have alienated her from him for ever, caused him to feel an alienation already begun between them--caused him to feel a certain repulsion towards a woman from whose mind he was in danger. The feeling had taken hold of him unawares, and he was vexed with himself for behaving in this new cold way to her. He could not suddenly command any affectionate looks or words; he could only exert himself to say what might serve as an excuse.|$|R

It revived him, and, turning round, he plunged his head into a bucket that a man held up for him. Then he took a long breath or two, pressed the water from his <b>hair,</b> and <b>felt</b> himself again. The women at the other window had by this time been brought down.

Katherine Farmar praised Mamahara's realistic secondary cast, neither detracting from the main couple, nor making it seem as though the couple exist in a vacuum, and not being simple plot devices to generate conflict. She also enjoyed the [...] "bold" [...] artwork. Katherine Dacey regards their consensual and comparatively tame relationship to be refreshing from other licensed titles available in English, but found that at times the dialogue was unrealistic.

5000|$|Until about 1930, most {{progress}} was empirical, that is, each hairdresser tended {{to use a}} method which he had found to be useful. By then, although some academic work had been done {{on the subject of}} <b>hair,</b> Calvete <b>felt</b> that more research should be done on the chemistry of hair, and engaged a chemist by the name of Bari-Woollss, who specialized in the subject. He carried out controlled experiments on known factors such as the effect of heat, water/steam and alkalinity and experimented on variations of the winding process, such as the type of hair, the tension or tightness of winding, the flatness of winding, the overlap and pitch.
