50|$|A gland is {{a general}} type of {{stuffing}} box, used to seal a rotating or reciprocating shaft against a fluid. The most common example is in {{the head of a}} tap (faucet) where the gland is usually packed with string which has been soaked in tallow or similar grease. The gland nut allows the packing material to be compressed to form a watertight seal and prevent water leaking up the shaft when the tap is turned on. The gland at the rotating shaft of a centrifugal pump may be packed in a similar way and graphite grease used to accommodate continuous operation. The linear seal around the piston rod of a <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> steam <b>piston</b> is also known as a gland, particularly in marine applications. Likewise the shaft of a handpump or wind pump is sealed with a gland where the shaft exits the borehole.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis work {{presents}} a network model {{to simulate the}} periodic behavior of a <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> free <b>piston</b> type Stirling engine. Each component of the engine is considered independently and its equivalent electrical circuit derived. When assembled in a global electrical network, a global model of the engine is established. Its steady behavior {{can be obtained by}} the analysis of the transfer function for one phase from the piston to the expansion chamber. It is then possible to simulate the dynamic (steady state stroke and operation frequency) as well as the thermodynamic performances (output power and efficiency) for given mean pressure, heat source and heat sink temperatures. The motion amplitude especially can be determined by the spring-mass properties of the moving parts and the main nonlinear effects which are taken into account in the model. The thermodynamic features of the model have then been validated using the classical isothermal Schmidt analysis for a given stroke. A three-phase low temperature differential <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> free membrane architecture has been built and tested. The experimental results are compared with the model and a satisfactory agreement is obtained. The stroke and operating frequency are predicted with less than 2 % error whereas the output power discrepancy is of about 30 %. Finally, some optimization routes are suggested to improve the design and maximize the performances aiming at waste heat recovery applications...|$|R

Introduction: The following tests were made on the {{compressed air}} plant in the Engineering Laboratory of the Kansas State Agricultural College. The plant is equipped as follows: a vertical engine the make and rated horse power of which are unknown, belted, through a main shaft, to a <b>double</b> <b>acting,</b> horizontal, <b>piston</b> compressor manufactured by the Ingersoll-Sergeant Drill company, and rated at from 8 to 13 horse power depending on the revolution, piston compressor manufactured by the Ingersoll-Sergeant Drill Company, and rated at from 8 to 13 horse power depending on the revolutions per minute and the receiver pressure. A Westinghouse engine with two 6 x 8 single acting cylinders {{was connected to the}} air receiver and used as an air motor. The object of the tests was to determine 1 st the efficiency of the plant, or the ratio of the developed brake horse power of the motor to the indicated horse power of the engine; 2 nd the efficiency between the engine and compressor cylinders, and between the compressor cylinder and the brake on the motor; 2 rd the horse power lost in heating the air and the cooling water. A series of three tests was conducted, the duration of each of which was one hour. Indicator cards were taken on the engine and compressor every five minutes throughout the test; as there was no means of taking cards on the air motor, a rope brake was constructed and used instead. Every five minutes, {{at the same time that}} the indicator cards instead. Every five minutes, at the same time that the indicator cards were taken, the speeds of the engine compressor and motor were noted, and at the same time, the initial and final temperatures of the air and cooling water, and the readings of the scale of the rope brake on the motor were taken. All water which passed through the water jacket of the compressor was carefully weighed and recorder, so that the total weight of water which passed through the jacket during the test was known...|$|R

The most simple solution to transforming the action of the beam into a rotating motion was to connect the beam to a wheel by a crank, but because another party had patent rights on the use of the crank, Watt was obliged to come up with another solution. He adopted the epicyclic sun and planet gear system suggested by an employee William Murdoch, only later reverting, once the patent rights had expired, to the more familiar crank seen on most engines today. The main wheel attached to the crank was large and heavy, serving as a flywheel which, once set in motion, by its momentum maintained a constant power and smoothed the action of the alternating strokes. To its rotating central shaft, belts and gears could be attached to drive a great variety of machinery.|$|E

The four working space (FWS) model was built to observe the behaviour of the whole engine. The drive dynamics and vehicle inertia effects are simulated. To reduce calculation time, only three volumes are used in each working space and the gas temperature are fixed (no energy equation).
