5|$|Magnetometers detect minute {{deviations}} in the Earth's {{magnetic field}} caused by iron artifacts, kilns, {{some types of}} stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt — the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners {{as early as the}} late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean <b>floor.</b> <b>When</b> newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, 2012 the Czech {{police arrested}} Randy Blythe {{for his actions}} during a 2010 concert in Prague.

Blythe pushed the teen who then hit {{his head on the}} <b>floor</b> <b>when</b> he fell and later died of the injury. Lamb of God canceled their upcoming tour but resumed touring 38 days later when Blythe was released on bail. Blythe was indicted on the charges in December 2012. According to a verdict delivered by the Municipal Court in Prague on March 5, 2013, Blythe had thrown Nosek off the stage and had moral responsibility for the fan's death but he was not criminally liable. The decision was appealed, and upheld by the Prague High Court in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|The eighth {{match was}} between A.J. Styles and Tetsuya Naito.

Styles later applied the Calf Killer, forcing Naito {{to grab the}} rope to break the hold. After another Styles Clash attempt, Naito countered by throwing Styles over the top rope to the <b>floor.</b> <b>When</b> Styles returned to the ring after a 19 count (NJPW employs a 20 count in their matches), Naito attempted a top-rope huracanrana. Styles blocked it, converting it to a Styles Clash from the second rope before pinning Naito for another Bullet Club victory at 14 minutes and 25 seconds.|$|E

5|$|While separated, {{they meet}} the {{inhabitants}} of the mansion—Maurice (Ed Asner) and Lyda (Lily Tomlin). The ghosts soon turn the agents against each other. Scully is told that Mulder will kill her. Scully meets back up with Mulder, only for him to pull out a gun and shoot her. Scully, completely confused, loses consciousness, and the perspective shifts. It is revealed that Lyda is actually the one carrying out these actions and, through her ghostly ability to create apparitions, causes Scully to see Mulder instead. Meanwhile, Mulder comes upon a bleeding Scully lying on the <b>floor.</b> <b>When</b> he leans over her to try to help her, she shoots Mulder in the stomach. Again, the audience sees that it is Lyda pretending to be Scully, manipulating Mulder.|$|E

5|$|On February 23, 1991, {{at about}} 8:23 PM, a fire {{began on the}} 22nd floor of the {{building}}. It was a Saturday night and {{there were only three}} people in the building at the time, an engineer and two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the floor. The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. Smoke detectors did not cover the entire floor {{and by the time the}} fire alarm went off the fire was already well established. After the fire alarm sounded in the building the engineer went up to the 22nd floor to investigate. When the elevator reached the 22nd floor the engineer found heavy smoke and heat that prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return to the lobby. The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby to recall the elevator using fire safety controls there. The second security guard was on the 30th <b>floor</b> <b>when</b> the alarm went off and used the stairwell to get to the ground floor.|$|E
