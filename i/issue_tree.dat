40|$|Data {{compression}} {{has been}} widely applied in many data processing areas. Compression methods use variable-size codes with the shorter codes assigned to symbols or groups of symbols that appear in the data frequently. Fibonacci coding, {{as a representative of}} these codes, is used for compressing small numbers. Time consumption of a decompression algorithm is not usually as important as the time of a compression algorithm. However, efficiency of the decompression may be a critical issue in some cases. For example, a real-time compression of tree data structures follows this <b>issue.</b> <b>Tree's</b> pages are decompressed during every reading from a secondary storage into the main memory. In this case, the efficiency of a decompression algorithm is extremely important. We have developed a Fast Fibonacci decompression for this purpose. Our approach is up to 3. 5 × faster than the original implementation...|$|R

50|$|Protection {{engineers}} define dependability as {{the tendency}} of the protection system to operate correctly for in-zone faults. They define security as the tendency not to operate for out-of-zone faults. Both dependability and security are reliability <b>issues.</b> Fault <b>tree</b> analysis is one tool with which a protection engineer can compare the relative reliability of proposed protection schemes. Quantifying protection reliability is important for making the best decisions on improving a protection system, managing dependability versus security tradeoffs, and getting the best results for the least money. A quantitative understanding is essential in the competitive utility industry.|$|R

40|$|This article {{develops}} {{a new approach}} for constructing causal maps called the Collective Causal Mapping Methodology (CCMM). This methodology collects information asynchronously {{from a group of}} dispersed and diverse subject-matter experts via Web technologies. Through three rounds of data collection, analysis, mapping, and interpretation, CCMM constructs a parsimonious collective causal map. The article illustrates the CCMM by constructing a causal map as a teaching tool for the field of operations management. Causal maps are an essential tool for managers who seek to improve complex systems in the areas of quality, strategy, and information systems. These causal maps are known by many names, including Ishikawa (fishbone) diagrams, cause-and-effect diagrams, impact wheels, <b>issue</b> <b>trees,</b> strategy maps, and risk-assessment mapping tools. Causal maps can be used by managers to focus attention on the root causes of a problem, find critical control points, guide risk management and risk mitigation efforts, formulate and communicate strategy, and teach the fundamental causal relationships in a complex system. Only two basic methods for creating causal maps are available to managers today-brainstorming and interviews. However, these methods are limited, particularly when the subject-matter experts cannot easily meet in the same place at the same time. Managers working with complex systems across large, geographically dispersed organizations can employ the CCMM presented here to efficiently and effectively construct causal maps to facilitate improving their systems...|$|R

In this paper we investigate the effect of six methods of pruning on ensembles of trees generated by Error-Correcting Output Code (ECOC).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the variety of}} management practices for the Butter tree (locally called Chiuri) in Makawanpur district, Nepal. Chiuri is a highly valued multipurpose species which has been customarily used and managed by local communities on state forest lands and on unregistered and registered private lands. As {{a result of their}} high value of the trees to local people, in the early 1990 s the District Forest Officer <b>issued</b> <b>tree</b> certificates for the trees on state forest lands to their ancestral users. In addition to this pseudo-legitimisation of private access to and use of Chiuri trees on state forest lands, private tree tenure rights exist for (un) registered private lands. As a result of the specific tree tenure conditions, the local pattern of management practices for Chiuri is different from the usual tree management patterns under different land tenure regimes. Often, on state and community forest lands indigenous tree management practices are restricted to socially-oriented control measures on resource extraction, whereas on private lands biologically-oriented management practices may also take place. The most intensive tree management practices usually occur on well-established private lands. In contrast, the management practices for Chiuri trees on state forest lands involve both socially-oriented and biologically-oriented management practices and the tree management itself is more intensive on the unregistered than on the registered private lands. The Chiuri management practices {{have a positive effect on}} forest conservation, and so the example of Chiuri user certificates on state forest lands provides an interesting alternative to the Nepalese strategy of stimulating community management as a means of forest protection...|$|R
