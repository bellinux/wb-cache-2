25|$|In late August 1989, {{while working}} as an {{engineer}} on the <b>jack-up</b> barge GSF Galveston Key in the North Sea, Chris Gibson and another witness saw an unfamiliar isosceles triangle-shaped delta aircraft, apparently refueling from a Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker and accompanied {{by a pair of}} F-111 fighter-bombers.

25|$|A single viaduct segment located {{over each}} column {{was cast in}} place using forms. Pairs of precast span segments, {{fabricated}} in Stockton, California, were barged to the location and lifted into place with a specialized cantilever lift. (Cantilever lifts, counterweights and other equipment and materials were lifted either by a barge crane or by a <b>jack-up</b> crane located between adjacent columns.) Once in the proper location, the opposing segments could then be joined with through tendons (cables within conduits that are tensioned with jacks), forming a balanced cantilever over the column. Eventually, the gap in spans between columns was closed, forming a tendon-reinforced beam.|$|E
2500|$|The {{four days}} lifting was {{completed}} on 17 August 1987, at 11:30p.m. thanks to 108 hydraulic cylinders synchronised with {{a network of}} 14 NUM 760FCNCs.

40|$|When working {{offshore}} on {{a floating}} vessel, the vessel will {{be subjected to}} wave induced motions and with a moving crane tip, a suspended load can start to swing. When the motions of the load become too large, the operation is interrupted. Alternatives such as <b>jack-ups,</b> function as a fixed platform to which the crane is attached, therefore eliminating the effect of waves on the workability of the vessel. Within the offshore wind industry, <b>jack-ups</b> are used for installation and maintenance of wind turbines. However, due to their slow transit speed and time-consuming jacking process, an alternative is suggested with which wind turbine maintenance can be performed. In this thesis study, the mechanical feasibility of a motion compensated crane for wind turbine maintenance is assessed by comparing three different crane concepts...|$|R

2500|$|The trench was dredged {{primarily}} {{by a series}} of specialised vessels, in several stages and with different equipment. [...] Much of the main trench for the Lee Tunnel was excavated by the backhoe dredger [...] "Zenne". Two barges were used to transport the dredged material 19km (12mi) downriver and from there to a disposal site four miles offshore. The cutter dredger [...] "Vlaanderen XIX" [...] removed the underlying fluvioglacial material. A second cutter dredger, [...] "Vlaanderen XV", was deployed to breach the casting basin perimeter, or [...] "bund". [...] A rock layer was encountered on part of the trench line, which was dealt with by the <b>jack-up</b> platform [...] "Zeebouwer". The [...] "Big Boss" [...] vessel was employed to remove the rock. This backhoe dredger was equipped with a [...] "Backhoover" [...] (in effect, a [...] "mini" [...] precision dredger). This system proved extremely effective in removing very thin layers of recently deposited material immediately prior to immersion of the tunnel elements.|$|E
50|$|Liftboats are {{commonly}} used to perform maintenance on oil and gas well platforms. The liftboat usually moves on location on a side of the platform where no obstructions or pipelines are observed, lowers its legs and jacks {{up out of the}} water. Because the pads of the liftboat are sitting on a muddy, unstable seafloor, most liftboats practice a safety measure called a preload, where the boat <b>jacks-up</b> the absolute minimum to clear hull from the tips of the significant wave heights, fills its holds with water for weight and allows the boat to settle in the mud for several hours before dumping the water and jacking up to work height.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review the {{worldwide}} historical structural failure data in the 1990 s on offshore structures, and compare this with the present risk analyses of Norwegian offshore structures.

The accident data is given for fixed platforms, <b>jack-ups</b> and for floating platforms. Estimates of risk level in annual frequencies and PLL values are given for each platform type. The paper concludes that: · The risk connected to marine operations and structures give a significant contribution to the total risk. · The historical risk to marine operations and structures is significant higher than the results from risk analyses. · Neither component nor system based reliability analyses of structures give adequate descriptions of the real risk connected to structures. · Human errors are probably the dominating cause of accidents connected to structural failure...|$|R

40|$|Drilling in {{challenging}} environments with different drilling hazards {{cause a lot}} of non-productive time (NPT), ie time where the rig is not drilling. Much of the challenging environments are in water depth demanding the use of floating drilling facilities. The result of NPT and high rig costs {{is a lot of money}} spent on nothing productive. To solve the challenges associated with challenging environments and high percentage of non-productive time, there is in particular one drilling method many operators have been looking at for the last decade, and that is managed pressure drilling (MPD), with its different variations. Even though there are several challenges associated with combining MPD and floaters and bringing them in to some geological areas, the involved parties in the industry seem to be determined to solve the challenges and take the technology into the future. Due to its experience with MPD from <b>jack-ups</b> and platforms, the operator BG Group is now looking towards utilizing MPD from floaters in several of their assets around the globe. The scope of this thesis is to look into the technology existing today and the experience gained up to date with MPD from floaters in various locations, which then could be useful for BG Group. The specific challenges for MPD from floaters, such as variations in drilling fluid temperature, surge and swab due to heave motions and riser margin, should be analyzed from a risk perspective. The proven benefits of performing MPD which gives a more accurate pressure control during the drilling operation and earlier detection of influx and losses suggests that MPD from floaters should be taken into use. The risks for bad weather conditions and possibilities of riser disconnect should be included in an overall risk analysis. Looking at the operations performed up to date on floaters, it is clear that a thorough planning process is crucial for a successful operation. Close collaboration in the planning process between operator, service companies and rig contractor with regard to equipment, procedures, HSE and last, but not least personnel training is of great importance...|$|R
30|$|The {{dominating}} role of OEMs {{is related}} {{to the fact that the}} installation of wind turbines is followed by a guarantee period (typically 3 – 5  years), during which the OEMs are usually responsible for the O&M activities. In other words, a few large OEMs dominate the market, e.g. Siemens and MHI Vestas, together with a few less dominating larger utilities, e.g. DONG Energy, Vattenfall and E.ON. However, a large amount of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) participate in the offshore wind park industry (VMI and Deloitte 2014). This typically means a blend of relatively few larger actors and many SMEs that perform activities on wind parks, from construction and installation to O&M. These independent service providers (ISPs) can be divided into two main categories. One of the categories is concerned with the maritime logistics to and from the offshore wind farms, and the other is focused on providing technically qualified manpower and equipment to undertake O&M-related activities. After the guarantee period, the wind park owner is likely to take over the O&M, and thereafter, these activities are typically undertaken by the wind park owner himself and/or outsourced to the ISPs. For the time being, the O&M market is primarily oligopolistic (Siemens and MHI Vestas), often with restricted opportunities for SMEs to participate. The main objective of the O&M activities is to ensure that the turbines run as smoothly as possible and have high performance in terms of electricity production during the lifetime operation. It provides higher yield for return on investments (Crown Estate 2012). The early wind parks could be reached quickly by using boats originally used for fishing, and the few technically relatively simple wind turbines were easy to access and maintain. However, these operations have gained increasing complexity, as with more remote locations, the logistics and the efficiency and effectiveness of O&M activities become very important. Additionally, more remote distances also mean that it is crucial to design logistic solutions, which, on the one hand, can ensure safe access to the turbines despite strong wind and high waves and, on the other hand, bring the employees to and from the site more quickly, either from the coast or from the accommodation ships or platforms situated at sea. Combinations of crew transport vessels (CTV), service operation vessels (SOV), <b>jack-ups</b> and helicopters are thus needed.|$|R
