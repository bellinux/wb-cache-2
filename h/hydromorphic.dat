The station lies along the Caño Palma (Palm Canal) in Tortuguero National Park, which rests within the Barra del Colorado Wildlife Refuge. Caño Palma is a palm-filled blackwater canal made up of <b>hydromorphic</b> soils that developed due to poor drainage (Myers, 1981) and has an average rainfall greater than 6,000 mm annually.

50|$|Zinc {{deficiency}} {{is common}} in {{many different types of}} soil; some soils (sandy soils, histosols and soils developed from highly weathered parent material) have low total zinc concentrations, and others have low plant-available zinc due to strong zinc sorption (calcareous soils, highly weathered soils, vertisols, <b>hydromorphic</b> soils, saline soils). Soils low in organic matter (such as where topsoils have been removed), and compacted soils that restrict root proliferation also have a high risk of zinc deficiency. Application of phosphorus fertilizers has frequently been associated with zinc deficiency; {{this may be due to}} enhanced sorption by clay minerals (especially iron oxides), suppression of vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae and/or immobilization of zinc in plant tissues. Liming of soils also frequently induces zinc deficiency by increasing zinc sorption.|$|E

50|$|The park's swamps, bogs, {{marshland}} and riparian forests on <b>hydromorphic</b> {{ground at}} all altitudes are rare worldwide. The western lowland {{sector of the}} park is dominated by dense Guineo-Congolian wet equatorial rainforest, with an area of transition forest between 1200 m and 1500 m.

Mountain and swamp forest grows between 2000 m and 2400 m, bamboo forest grows between 2350 m and 2600 m, and the summits of Mounts Kahuzi and Biéga above 2600 m have subalpine heather, dry savannah, and grasslands, as well as the endemic plant Senecio kahuzicus.|$|E
50|$|Although it {{is grown}} widely in Nigeria, {{the area where}} it is grown most is the Benue State (land area of 802,295 km²) one of the states in Benue valley of Nigeria where the {{labour-intensive}} practices are still the norm and the land holdings are small. In this state especially among Tiv people, {{the size of the}} yam farm or the tonnage of yams produced becomes the social status of that farmer. Because of high level of yam production in the State of Benue, Benue State is crowned as the Nigerian Bread Basket. Yams are planted on mounds rather than flat slopes depending on the <b>hydromorphic</b> nature of the soils which are generally of loose soil suitable to grow roots and tuber crops. While yam production issues have been stressed on agronomical practices, a research study carried out on the economic efficiency of this crop grown in this region with small farm holdings, which is labour-intensive, reveals that land, labour and material (fertilizers and chemicals), credit and extension services inputs have a significant bearing on the yield of yam in the region.|$|E
50|$|The park {{consists}} of 4,540 km2 of tropical evergreen forest {{located at the}} south western corner of Côte d'Ivoire, bordering Liberia. Altitudes vary from 80 m to 396 m (Mt. Niénokoué). The park is situated on a Precambrian granite peneplain of migmatites, biotites and gneiss which slopes down from the gently undulating drier north to more deeply dissected land in the south where the rainfall is heavy. This plateau at between 150-200 meters is broken by several granite inselbergs formed from plutonic intrusions, including the Mont Niénokoué in the southwest. A large zone of varied schists runs north-east to south-west across the park, dissected by tributaries of the main watercourses which run parallel to it: the N'zo, Meno and Little Hana and Hana rivers, all draining southwest to the river Cavally. In the wet season these rivers are wide, but in the dry season become shallow streams. The northern border of the adjoining N’Zo Faunal Reserve is formed by the large reservoir behind the Buyo Dam on the N'zo and Sassandra rivers. There is some swamp forest in the northwest {{of the park and}} in N'zo. The soils are ferralitic, generally leached and of low fertility. In the southern valleys there are <b>hydromorphic</b> gley and more fertile alluvial soils (DPN,1998). Gold and some other minerals exist in small quantities.|$|E
5000|$|Two broad forest {{types are}} present: forests of <b>hydromorphic</b> soils, and forests of [...] The forests of terra firma {{are the most}} extensive, and may be further {{subdivided}} into closed canopy forests and open forests. The forests of terra firma are generally quite heterogeneous in terms of species, although patches of Lophira alata-dominated forest exist. In Odzala, both forest types of terra firma are classed as Marantaceae forest: that is, the understorey is an often impenetrable mass of lianescent or erect giant herbs in the family Marantaceae. This forms a thick carpet, up to 3-4m deep, giving {{the impression of a}} giant 'lawn' through which tree seedlings must grow to reach the light. In the open Marantaceae forests, the middle-sized trees are much less common than in a closed-canopy forest, sometimes giving one the impression of being an ant in a lawn, with trees so far apart that they are like a London park!. Data from transects in Odzala show that both tree density and basal area of Marantaceae forest is much lower per hectare than [...] "classic" [...] tropical humid forests of Central Africa. Marantaceae forest is thought to be a stage in the succession of the forest recolonization of the savanna. Several other forest types are recognizable at Odzala as stages in this succession.|$|E
40|$|Gray <b>hydromorphic</b> {{soils are}} imperfectly to poorly drained soils that {{occur on the}} coastal fringes of the Hawaiian Islands on {{surfaces}} of Pleistocene to Recent age. Mottling is characteristic of the soils, and gley horizons occur in the more <b>hydromorphic</b> soils in the group. As the soils become <b>hydromorphic,</b> soil color values increase and structures deteriorate. Halloysite is the dominant clay mineral in the less <b>hydromorphic</b> soils and montmorillonite is dominant in the more <b>hydromorphic</b> soils of the group.

Hydrated halloysite occurs in all the soils studied, but it is most abundant in the more <b>hydromorphic</b> soils. Although the soils are derived from different alluvial materials, the trend of increasing montmorillonite and increasing hydrated halloysite with increasing hydromorphism is clearly related to the pedogenic processes operating in the soils. Similar mineralogical trends are found with increasing depth in each soil...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{examines}} the lateral distribution of hydromorphy in the fine-grained alluvial deposits of the Eocene Pondaung Formation, central Myanmar. Through detailed outcrop analysis {{and using a}} combined sedimentological and pedological approach, this study proposes a reconstruction of Pondaung overbank floodplain palaeoenvironments. The variations of <b>hydromorphic</b> features in the different overbank sub-environments are then discussed and used to build a model of <b>hydromorphic</b> variability in alluvial deposits. Two main architectural associations with distinctive lithofacies and pedogenic features were identified, corresponding to different sub-environments: heterolithic deposits and extensive mudstone successions. The heterolithic deposits display variegated fine-grained lithofacies and contain poorly developed palaeosols with gley and vertic features, which are interpreted to reflect a seasonal wetlands landscape, developed in actively aggrading avulsion belts. Extensive mudstone successions with Vertisols that locally exhibit mukkara-style pseudogley features are interpreted to represent a distal open-forested environment. The palaeosols of both sub-environments display dense local <b>hydromorphic</b> variations they are also characterized by a gradual shift from gley-dominated to pseudogley-dominated features with increasing distance from the avulsion belt. The clay-dominated lithology of the floodplain parent material, which forms numerous subsurface permeability barriers, is shown to have acted as a fundamental control in limiting water-table dynamics in coarse-grained parts of the succession, thereby favouring <b>hydromorphic</b> variability. Palaeosol sequences of the Pondaung Formation contrast with the soil-landscape associations described in other studies and provide an alternative model with which {{to account for the}} <b>hydromorphic</b> variability in poorly drained, alluvial soils. The model proposed as an outcome of this study demonstrates that <b>hydromorphic</b> variations can be dramatic in floodplains where permeability barriers are numerous. Further, the model stresses the importance of undertaking detailed lateral palaeosol analyses prior to making interpretations regarding <b>hydromorphic</b> variability...|$|E
40|$|The <b>hydromorphic</b> and subaqueous soils {{have largely}} been {{overlooked}} on their pedogenic concepts or in soil C accounting studies considering their phisico-chemical properties.

The aim of the study was to evaluate biological properties such as enzyme activities and the functional diversity of soil microbial population as bio- indicators, sensitive to processes affected by the water shallow. Eight soil profiles were opened along two transects: 1) a-a’ North and 2) b-b' South, in a dune ecosystem of the Adriatic coast, Ravenna (Italy). The soil chemical and biochemical properties were determined. In particular, soil enzyme activities and soil induced respiration were measured using the microplates technique in order to assess the microbial functional diversity. The soil biochemical properties such as the potential enzyme activities and microbial induced respiration, as well as microbial functional diversity were sensitive indicators to study <b>hydromorphic</b> and subaqueous soils. A general reduction of hydrolytic enzyme activities was observed in subaqueous soil with respect to <b>hydromorphic</b> one. Moreover, the endopedon of subaqueous soils showed a lower microbial functional diversity than <b>hydromorphic</b> one. In this study the ratio of enzyme activities involved in C to S cycles (SEIC/Aryl) as well as the C:S ratio showed a marked reduction in the subaqueous with respect to <b>hydromorphic</b> soils.

The assessment of the storage capacity of these soils is essential to assign 'risk areas' according to national (German Federal Soil Protection Act, 1998) and international (EU Soil Protection Strategy, 2006) soil protection requirements. An appropriate water management enables preservation and protection of the soil organic matter in <b>hydromorphic</b> soils.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{clay mineral}} transformations in <b>hydromorphic</b> {{conditions in the}} red earth sediments in Xuancheng, south China, clay mineralogy was investigated using X‑ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The XRD results indicated that clay minerals in the <b>hydromorphic</b> soils were illite, kaolinite, smectite, vermiculite, and mixed-layer illite/smectite and illite/smectite/kaolinite. Changes of the kaolinitic reflections under the various conditions suggested that the kaolinitic phase is a mixed-layer structure having kaolinite layers randomly interstratified with illite and smectite layers. HRTEM observation showed that 10 Å illite layers interstratified with both 15 Å smectite layers and 7 Å kaolinite layers in clay particles, confirming the occurrence of illite/smectite/kaolinite (I/S/K) three-component mixed-layer clays. The lattice fringes of the I/S/K clays appeared corrugated and vanishing, and also exhibited variable thickness along a lattice fringe, which were consistent with changes from illite to smectite, from smectite to kaolinite, and from illite to kaolinite, respectively. <b>Hydromorphic</b> conditions in the Xuancheng soils led simultaneously to the direct transformation of illite to kaolinite and the transformation of illite to smectite to kaolinite in the pedogenic processes, {{and the formation of}} I/S/K three-component mixed-layer clays as intermediate products of these processes.
