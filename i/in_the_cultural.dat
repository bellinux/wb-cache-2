The city has 31 National Treasures, and Gyeongju National Museum houses 16,333 artifacts. There are four broad categories of relics and historical sites: tumuli and their artifacts; Buddhist sites and objects; fortresses and palace sites; and ancient architecture. Prehistoric remains including Mumun pottery have been excavated in central Gyeongju, in the Moa-ri and Oya-ri villages of the Cheonbuk-myeon district, and in the Jukdong-ri village of the Oedong-eup district.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> sphere, {{there were}} some Mongol {{elements}} in Western medieval art, especially in Italy, of which most surviving examples are from the 14th century, after {{the chance of a}} military alliance had faded. These included the depiction of textiles from the Mongol Empire and Mongol script in various contexts, the latter often anachronistic. Imports of textiles had a considerable influence on Italian textile design. Mongol military costume is sometimes worn by soldiers, typically those acting against Christian figures, as in martyrdoms or Crucifixion scenes. These were perhaps copied from drawings made of Mongol envoys to Europe, or ones brought back from Outremer.|$|E
5|$|Most of the signatories of the Act {{remained}} active <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> {{and political}} life of independent Lithuania. Jonas Vileišis served in the Seimas and as mayor of Kaunas, temporary capital of Lithuania; Saliamonas Banaitis was involved in finance, opening several banks. Among the signatories were two future Presidents of Lithuania, Antanas Smetona and Aleksandras Stulginskis. Jonas Basanavičius, chairman of the Council of Lithuania, returned to an academic life, pursuing his research in Lithuanian culture and folklore. Five signatories died before World War II started; three died during the Nazi occupation. Those who did not emigrate to Western countries became political prisoners after Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Adi Shankaracharya (788–820) chose Sringeri in Karnataka to {{establish}} {{the first of his}} four mathas (monastery). Madhvacharya (1238–1317) was the chief proponent of Tattvavada (Philosophy of Reality), popularly known as Dvaita or Dualistic school of Hindu philosophy— one of the three most influential Vedanta philosophies. Madhvacharya was one of the important philosophers during the Bhakti movement. He was a pioneer in many ways, going against standard conventions and norms. According to tradition, Madhvacharya {{is believed to be the}} third incarnation of Vayu (Mukhyaprana), after Hanuman and Bhima. The Haridasa devotional movement is considered as one of the turning points <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> history of India. Over a span of nearly six centuries, several saints and mystics helped shape the culture, philosophy and art of South India and Karnataka in particular by exerting considerable spiritual influence over the masses and kingdoms that ruled South India.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana {{was sent}} {{to live in a}} village that his father named Ambohimanga. As a young man, his father granted him the region of Avaradrano {{surrounding}} the village, and while his father still lived he managed the daily affairs of state in Avaradrano without taking the title of king. He declared Ambohimanga the capital of the region, building numerous structures on the site and adding its first set of defensive walls, ditches and gates. The site's historic and cultural significance was recognized in 2001 when UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site, the only one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> category in Madagascar. He became an independent king upon his father's death and the resulting partition of the Kingdom of Imerina in 1710, from which he received Avaradrano, the easternmost and largest territory. He died around 1730 and was buried at Ambohimanga.|$|E
5|$|Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and {{insecure}} man {{in private}} but adopted {{a warm and}} outgoing public persona.

His reputation changed {{in the years after}} his death, from a purveyor of homely patriotic values to a representative of American imperialism. He nevertheless remains an important figure in the history of animation and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> history of the United States, where he is considered a national cultural icon. His film work continues to be shown and adapted; his studio maintains high standards in its production of popular entertainment, and the Disney amusement parks have grown in size and number to attract visitors in several countries.|$|E

5|$|Libraries in Denmark {{are also}} {{cultural}} and community centres. They {{play an active}} role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> life and host many events, exhibitions, discussion groups, workshops, educational courses and facilitate everyday cultural activities for and by the citizens. In June 2015, the large central library and cultural centre of Dokk1 opened at the harbour front. Dokk1 also includes civil administrations and services, commercial office rentals and a large underground robotic car park and aims to be a landmark for the city and a public meeting place. The building of Dokk1 and the associated squares and streetscape is also collectively known as Urban Mediaspace Aarhus and it is the largest construction project Aarhus municipality has ever undertaken. Apart from this large main library, some neighbourhoods in Aarhus have a local library engaged in similar cultural and educational activities, but on a more local scale.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 1957, Houphouët-Boigny became Minister of Public Health and Population in the Gaillard {{administration}} {{and attempted to}} reform the public health code. He had previously served as Minister of State under Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury (13 June– 6 November 1957). Following his Gaillard ministry, he was again appointed Minister of State from 14 May 1958;– 20 May 1959. In this capacity, he participated {{in the development of}} France's African policy, notably <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> domain. At his behest, the Bureau of French Overseas Students and the University of Dakar were created. On 4 October 1958, Houphouët-Boigny was one of the signatories, along with de Gaulle, of the Constitution of the Fifth Republic. The last post he held in France was Minister-Counsellor in the Michel Debré government, from 23 July 1959 to 19 May 1961.|$|E
5|$|One of the king's most {{substantial}} achievements was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cultural</b> sphere; {{he became}} a notable patron of the arts. Władysław was a connoisseur of the arts, in particular, theater and music. He spoke several languages, enjoyed reading historical literature and poetry. He collected paintings and created a notable gallery of paintings in the Warsaw castle. Władysław assembled an important collection of Italian and Flemish Baroque paintings, much of which {{were lost in the}} wars after his death. He sponsored many musicians and in 1637 created the first amphitheater in the palace, the first theater in Poland, where during his reign dozens of operas and ballets were performed. He is credited with bringing the very genre of opera to Poland. Władysław's attention to theater contributed to the spread of this art form in Poland. He was also interested in poetry, as well as in cartography and historical and scientific works; he corresponded with Galileo.|$|E

5|$|Sources {{from the}} 9th and 10th centuries make {{no mention of}} the Polan (Polanie) tribe. The closest thing would be the huge (400 gords) Glopeani tribe of the Bavarian Geographer, whose name seems to be derived from that of Lake Gopło, but archeological {{investigations}} cannot confirm any such scale of settlement activity in Lake Gopło area. What the research does indicate is the presence of several distinct tribes in 9th-century Greater Poland, one around the upper and middle Obra River basin, one in the lower Obra basin, and another one west of the Warta River. There was the Gniezno area tribe, whose settlements were concentrated around the regional cult center: the Lech Hill of today's Gniezno. Throughout the 9th century, the Greater Poland tribes did not constitute a uniform entity or whole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cultural,</b> or settlement pattern sense. The centrally located Gniezno Land was at that time rather isolated from external influences, such as from the highly developed Moravian-Czech or Baltic Sea centers. Such separation was probably a positive factor by facilitating the efforts of a lineage of leaders from an elder clan of a tribe there, known as the Piast House, which resulted {{in the early part of}} the 10th century in the establishment of an embryonic Polish state.|$|E
5|$|Wu's {{older brother}} died in 1958, {{her father in}} 1959 and her mother in 1962.

She saw her uncle Wu Zhou-Zhi and younger brother Wu Chien-Hao again {{on a trip to}} Hong Kong in 1965. After the 1972 Nixon visit to China, {{relations between the two countries}} improved, and she was able to visit China again in 1973. By this time her uncle and brother had perished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cultural</b> Revolution, and the tombs of her parents had been destroyed. She was greeted by Chou En-Lai, who personally apologized for the destruction of the tombs. After this, she returned to China a number of times.|$|E
