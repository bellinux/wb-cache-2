40|$|Purpose Currently, the {{reduction}} of weight in automotive {{is a very important}} topic in order to lower the air pollution. In this context, {{the purpose of the present}} paper was to analyze a real case study through a comparison of the environmental sustainability between a conventional steel crossbeam for light commercial vehicles and an innovative lightweight aluminum one. Methods For both scenarios, a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment methodology and a sensitivity analysis has been used through the study of the following phases: mineral extraction, component manufacturing, use on vehicle, and end of life. In particular, many primary data and a complete vehicle model simulation with three different European driving cycles have been used in order to reach the highest possible level of accuracy during the analysis. Results and discussion Regarding the manufacturing phase, the aluminum component’s production gave the highest impact because of the high energy required in the mineral reduction. Anyway, this stage of the analysis had a low effect on the entire LCA,becausethebenefitofweightreductionduringvehicleuseshowedastronglyhighercontribution. Theurbandrivingcycle had the most relevant impact, as a consequence of the frequent start and stop operations and the longest time with engine at idle speed, while the <b>extra-urban</b> <b>cycle</b> is the less demanding due to its higher average speed and no start and stop.

50|$|The {{combined}} {{fuel economy}} is calculated by a total consumption of urban and <b>extra-urban</b> <b>cycles</b> over the total distance (theoretical 11023 meters). The total test time amounts to 1180 s {{with an average}} speed of 33.6 km/h. Sometimes the NEDC is also quoted at 1220 s, which includes the initial 40 s with the vehicle at standstill and combustion engine off.|$|R
5000|$|The 2.3 L Duratec 23 was {{replaced}} by a new 2.5 L (2488 cc, 152 cu in) Duratec 25, which boosted standard power to [...] and [...] of torque, while increasing fuel economy by 1 mpg (~2L/100 km) on both urban and <b>extra-urban</b> <b>cycles.</b> The optional 3.0 L Duratec 30 V6 was thoroughly updated, resulting in a [...] increase, bringing power output to [...] and [...] of torque. The Duratec 30 also sees a 1 mpg fuel economy improvement. The [...] "Escape" [...] badge is entirely removed from the front doors.|$|R
50|$|The <b>extra-urban</b> driving <b>cycle</b> or EUDC lasts 400 seconds (6 minutes 40 seconds) at {{an average}} speed 62.6 km/h (39 mph) and {{a top speed of}} 120 km/h (74.6 mph).|$|R
5000|$|The Tribute {{received}} additional {{major changes}} {{to improve performance}} for the 2009 model year, mostly by way of mechanical upgrades. Most significantly, all new engines replaced the increasingly outmatched 2.3L I4 and 3.0L V6. Mazda's new MZR 2.5L I4 replaced the 2.3L, boosting horsepower to [...] and 171 lbft Nm of torque at 4000 rpm. Despite increased horsepower, fuel economy also increased by 1 mpg on both urban and <b>extra-urban</b> <b>cycles.</b> The optional 3.0 L (AJ) V6 was thoroughly updated, resulting in a [...] increase, bringing power output to [...] and [...] of torque. It also sees a 1 mpg improvement. The Tribute Hybrid was dropped after the 2009 model year.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Extra-Urban</b> Driving <b>Cycle</b> EUDC, {{introduced}} by ECE R101 in 1990, {{has been designed}} to represent more aggressive, high speed driving modes. The maximum speed of the EUDC cycle is 120 km/h; low-powered vehicles are limited to 90 km/h.|$|R
50|$|The NEDC, {{which is}} {{supposed}} to represent the typical usage of a car in Europe, is repeatedly criticised for delivering economy-figures which are unachievable in reality. It consists of four repeated ECE-15 urban driving cycles (UDC) and one <b>Extra-Urban</b> driving <b>cycle</b> (EUDC).|$|R
40|$|Developed Countries that {{signed the}} Kyoto Protocol are {{required}} to attain the established limits to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or to pay penalty for the exceeding amount. In order {{to comply with the}} Protocol, CEE strategy is based on capillary information of fuel consumption of motor vehicles, to be done by producers, coupled to economic incentives to users in order to encourage ecological choices. The need to standardize the measure of GHG emission, related to the fuel consumption of a vehicle, allowed the drawing up of a very detailed procedure that includes the choice of driving simulation on urban and <b>extra-urban</b> <b>cycles.</b> Many drivers claim that the difference between consumption of their own car and values declared by the producer is too high; tests performed by experts and published on trade journals such as Quattroruote (Italy) and Autobild (Germany), also demonstrate this datum; unfortunately nothing can be done to go against producers as such differences mainly depend on almost unrealistic car use simulations. Car producers fully respect the 98 / 69 /CE [1] while the 1999 / 94 /CE [2] is not so carefully followed. Moreover, the presented case study evidences that the board computer (BC), also currently equipping also small cars, furnishes false data aiming to convince driver of fuel consumption that is lower than the real one. Does this also happens on other cars? Is it correct that a consumer must pay an instrument to obtain misleading advertising...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (HEV) control strategy is a management approach for generating, using, and saving energy. Therefore, the optimal control strategy is the sticking point to effectively manage hybrid {{electric vehicle}}s. In order {{to realize the}} optimal control strategy, we use a robust evolutionary computation method called a “memetic algorithm (MA) ” to optimize the control parameters in parallel HEVs. The “local search” mechanism implemented in the MA greatly enhances its search capabilities. In {{the implementation of the}} method, the fitness function combines with the ADvanced VehIcle SimulatOR (ADVISOR) and is set up according to an electric assist control strategy (EACS) to minimize the fuel consumption (FC) and emissions (HC, CO, and NOx) of the vehicle engine. At the same time, driving performance requirements are also considered in the method. Four different driving cycles, the new European driving cycle (NEDC), Federal Test Procedure (FTP), Economic Commission for Europe + <b>Extra-Urban</b> driving <b>cycle</b> (ECE + EUDC), and urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) are carried out using the proposed method to find their respectively optimal control parameters. The results show that the proposed method effectively helps to reduce fuel consumption and emissions, as well as guarantee vehicle performance...|$|R
40|$|Reduction of {{pollutant}} emission by exhaust systems due to stricter limits has drastically increased {{the impact of}} previously ignored factors {{on the results of}} emission tests. One such factor is the cooling of the engine by the chassis dynamometer's external fan. Improper cooling can increase the temperature of the engine and the catalytic converter. Preliminary studies conducted by the Motor Transport Institute have confirmed that the configuration of the cooling fan influences exhaust system emissions. This article discusses the results of tests aimed at identifying the cause of changes in emission levels. To achieve this aim, emission levels were measured for various configurations of the chassis dynamometer (including both the fan speed and the distance {{from the front of the}} vehicle). During the tests, measurements were taken of temporary pollutant levels in the CVS and of the temperature of exhaust before and after the catalytic converter. The results confirmed the findings of preliminary tests. Increased exhaust emission levels were noted, though not, as anticipated, during the urban driving cycle, but rather during the final phase of the <b>extra-urban</b> driving <b>cycle.</b> Measurements were taken using a single-roller chassis dynamometer equipped with a cooling fan with a regulated fan speed specified by a second-degree curve...|$|R
