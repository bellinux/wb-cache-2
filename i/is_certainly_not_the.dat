25|$|Besides {{the neural}} {{connections}} of the receptors, the optical system is an equally {{key player in}} retinal resolution. In the ideal eye, {{the image of a}} diffraction grating can subtend 0.5 micrometre on the retina. This <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case, however, and furthermore the pupil can cause diffraction of the light. Thus, black lines on a grating will be mixed with the intervening white lines to make a gray appearance. Defective optical issues (such as uncorrected myopia) can render it worse, but suitable lenses can help. Images (such as gratings) can be sharpened by lateral inhibition, i.e., more highly excited cells inhibiting the less excited cells. A similar reaction is in the case of chromatic aberrations, in which the color fringes around black-and-white objects are inhibited similarly.|$|E

My only real concern was that the story would not be told in a sensationalist or distasteful way. She's not a stereotypical character and being gay <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only interesting thing about her." [...] Neval made her first screen appearance as Lana during the episode broadcast on 30 August 2004. In April 2005, Eliza Taylor-Cotter said that she had originally auditioned for the role of Lana, before joining the cast as Janae Timmins.|$|E
2500|$|Woodcut old master prints {{had begun}} {{around the turn}} of the century, and were {{extremely}} popular by the start of the Master of the Playing Cards' career, but were then almost all very crudely executed. Playing cards and religious images were the vast majority of the production. [...] Although he comes very early in the history of engraving for prints, the Master of the Playing Cards <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> inventor of the technique. He is however considered the first significant artist to use either printmaking technique. [...] The art historian Arthur Mayger Hind characterised his style as [...] "incisive and individual".|$|E

2500|$|The Pi {{function}} <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> {{only way}} to extend factorials to a function defined at almost all complex values, and not even {{the only one that}} is analytic wherever it is defined. Nonetheless it is usually considered the most natural way to extend the values of the factorials to a complex function. [...] For instance, the Bohr–Mollerup theorem states that the Gamma function is the only function that takes the value 1 at 1, satisfies the functional equation Γ(n+1)=nΓ(n), is meromorphic on the complex numbers, and is log-convex on the positive real axis. [...] A similar statement holds for the Pi function as well, using the Π(n)=nΠ(n−1) functional equation.|$|E

McCarthy had leveled against the Army, Holloway replied, [...] "It is not. I am not saying that in criticism of anyone else...Sometimes, in the best of families, the right hand does not know what the left hand doeth.

When an American broadcast network is broadcasting the same show {{at the same time}} that Global is (such as the programs mentioned above), Canadian cable subscribers may only watch the Global Television broadcast, even when trying to view the American stations. This law gives them double exposure for their content and a larger share of advertising revenue, effectively blocking American border cities from access to the Canadian market. This was done to help give money to the networks to fund Canadian content development. Global <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only Canadian broadcaster to use simsubs; nonetheless, some complaints, specific to Global, have arisen due to the following related practices: ...|$|E
2500|$|Lorde {{actively}} strived for {{the change}} of culture within the feminist community by implementing womanist ideology. In the journal [...] "Anger Among Allies: Audre Lorde's 1981 Keynote Admonishing the National Women's Studies Association," [...] it is stated that Lorde's speech contributed to communication with scholars' understanding of human biases. While [...] "anger, marginalized communities, and US Culture" [...] are the major themes of the speech, Lorde implemented various communication techniques to shift subjectivities of the [...] "white feminist" [...] audience. Lorde further explained that [...] "we are working {{in a context of}} oppression and threat, the cause of which <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> angers which lie between us, but rather that virulent hatred leveled against all women, people of color, lesbians and gay men, poor people—against all of us who are seeking to examine the particulars of our lives as we resist our oppressions, moving towards coalition and effective action." ...|$|E

Peter Lampe, professor of New Testament Studies at the University of Heidelberg and working in archaeology, pointed out that in the 120s/130s C.E. in the port town of Maoza {{at the southern end of}} the Dead Sea, one Jewish household comprised the following names: Jesus, Simon, Mariame, Jacobus and Judah (Papyri Babatha 17 from 128 C.E.; 25-26 and 34 from 131 C.E.). These people had nothing to do with the New Testament or the Talpiyot tomb. [...] "According to the rationale of the filmmakers, these people should not have existed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most {{knowledge}} of the Cyclic epics comes from a broken summary of them which serves {{as part of the}} preface to the famous 10th century CE Iliad manuscript known as Venetus A. This preface is damaged, missing the Cypria, and has to be supplemented by other sources (the Cypria summary is preserved in several other manuscripts, each of which contains only the Cypria and none of the other epics). The summary is in turn an excerpt from a longer work, Chrestomathy, written by a [...] "Proclus". This is known from evidence provided by the later scholar Photius, mentioned above. Photius provides sufficient information about Proclus' Chrestomathy to demonstrate that the Venetus A excerpt is derived from the same work. Little is known about Proclus, except that he <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> philosopher Proclus Diadochus. Some have thought that it might be the same person as the lesser-known grammarian Eutychius Proclus, who lived in the 2nd century CE, but {{it is quite possible that}} he is simply an otherwise unknown figure.|$|E
