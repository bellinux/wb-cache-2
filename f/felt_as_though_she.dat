There, she defeated Antonella Serra Zanetti, Marta Domachowska, and Nicole Pratt before losing in the deciding-set tie-break after a very close second-round main-draw tussle against newly crowned US Open Champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, during which she held match points against Kuznetsova. The Russian afterwards praised her Chinese opponent, stating that she had <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> was up against a top-5 player.|$|E
25|$|However, if the tsar’s {{policies}} were too extreme or too disliked, {{he was not}} considered the true tsar. In these cases, {{it was necessary to}} replace this “fake” tsar with the “true” tsar, whoever he may be. Because the serfs had no political power, they rioted to get their message across. But usually, if the serfs did not like the policies of the tsar, they saw the nobles as corrupt and evil, preventing the people of Russia from communicating with the well-intentioned tsar and misinterpreting his decrees. However, they were already suspicious of Catherine upon her accession, because she had annulled an act by Peter III that had essentially freed the serfs belonging to the Orthodox Church. Naturally, the serfs did not like it when Catherine tried to take away their right to petition her because they <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> had severed their connection to the autocrat, and their power to appeal to her. Far away from the capital, they were also confused as to the circumstances of her accession to the throne.|$|E
25|$|Early {{information}} of Charlotte Charke {{can be found}} in the autobiography called a Narrative of The Life of Mrs. Charlotte Charke by Charlotte Charke herself, she wrote this and published it as a male author. In A narrative of the life of Mrs. Charlotte Charke, they talk to us about her child hood, Charlotte speaks about how she was born when her mother was forty five years of age, and not only was she late coming into the family, but she also <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> had been unwanted. She was the twelfth and last child born to actor/playwright poet laureate Colley Cibber and the musician/actress Katherine Shore. Most of her many siblings died before their first birthday. According to her autobiography, her brothers and sisters resented her arrival when she was young and many of them maintained their dislike throughout their lives.Charlotte was bold from a young age., family members and close friends of the family say that Charlotte began to show her “addiction” to manly activities at a young age. She was a great shot, she enjoyed, and was good at dressing horses, and at an early age preferred digging in the Gardens dirt. With the absence of her father due to business endeavours and the lack of a mother figure due to constant illnesses, Charlotte became as independent as a young child her age could be, only to put up with nagging maids that watched over her every once and while.|$|E
60|$|The {{article was}} dated New York. There was more, but Billy did not read it. He had read enough. It {{is true that}} he had urged her to marry Mallory; but now, in his lonesomeness and friendlessness, he <b>felt</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> had been untrue to him.|$|R
60|$|During {{all that}} week Godfrey fought with himself. He {{did not wish}} to have {{anything}} {{more to do with the}} white and ghostly Eleanor, who changed her gems so constantly, and said that she had known him millenniums ago. Indeed, he <b>felt</b> already <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> were much too near him, especially at night, when he seemed to become aware of her bending over his bed, and generally making her presence known in other uncomfortable ways that caused his hair to stand up and frightened him.|$|R
60|$|The words struck {{heavy on}} her heart, numbing it--why, she knew not. For a moment <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> helpless, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> could neither sing nor play. She {{did not wish}} him to go; she did not wish him to go. Her intellect came to her aid. Why should he go? Heaven had given her power, and this man could feel its weight. Would it not suffice {{to keep him from}} going? She would try; she would play and sing as she had never done before; sing till his heart was soft, play till his feet had no {{strength}} to wander beyond the sound of the sweet notes her art could summon from this instrument of strings and wood.|$|R
500|$|Excited by the experience, Goldman refined {{her public}} persona during {{subsequent}} engagements. Quickly, however, {{she found herself}} arguing with Most over her independence. After a momentous speech in Cleveland, she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> had become [...] "a parrot repeating Most's views" [...] and resolved to express herself on the stage. Upon her return in New York, Most became furious and told her: [...] "Who is not with me is against me!" [...] She left Freiheit and joined with another publication, Die Autonomie.|$|E
500|$|... "My Hands" [...] was {{selected}} as the official theme song for the English version of the video game Final Fantasy XIII. Lewis decided to accept the offer of her track being used as she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> connected with the video game's female protagonist, Lightning. The song garnered a mixed response from music critics, who described it as forgettable, despite noting that Lewis performs the song undeniably well. In March 2010, [...] "My Hands" [...] debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 145.|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale had {{an eight-year}} {{relationship}} with actor Michael Sheen from 1995 until 2003. They met when {{cast in a}} touring production of The Seagull in early 1995 and moved in together shortly afterwards. In 1997, they voiced a radio production of Romeo and Juliet. Their daughter, Lily, was born in London in 1999. The actress has said she was [...] "embarrassed" [...] that Sheen never proposed, but <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> were married. Their relationship ended in early 2003, after the filming of Underworld. Beckinsale and Sheen remain close friends. She remarked in 2016: [...] "He's really dear, close family. He's somebody I've known since I was 21 years old. I really love him a lot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't believe it,' {{repeated}} Hetta, {{feeling that}} to say even {{as much as}} that was some relief to her. It could not be true. It was impossible that the man should have come to her with such a lie in his mouth <b>as</b> that. <b>Though</b> the words astounded her, <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> faint, almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> would fall in a swoon, yet in her heart of hearts she did not believe it. Surely it was some horrid joke,--or perhaps some trick to divide her from the man she loved. 'Felix, how dare you say things so wicked as that to me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|A week {{passed by}} and then arrived {{the day on}} which it had been {{arranged}} that Hester {{was to go to}} Chesterton and see her mother. There had been numerous letters, and at last the matter was settled between Caldigate and old Mr. Bolton at the bank. 'I think you had better let her come alone,' the old man had said when Caldigate asked whether he might be allowed to accompany his wife. 'Mrs. Bolton has not been well since her daughter's marriage and has felt the desolation of her position very much. She is weak and nervous, and I think you had better let Hester come alone.' Had Caldigate known his mother-in-law better he would not have suggested a visit from himself. No one who did know her would have looked forward to see her old hatred eradicated by an absence of nine months. Hester therefore went into Cambridge alone, and was taken up to the house by her father. As she entered the iron gates <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> were going into the presence of one who was an enemy to herself. And yet when she saw her mother, she rushed at once into the poor woman's arms. 'Oh, mamma, dear mamma, dearest mamma! My own, own, own mamma!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Barbara listened, smiling lazily. Granny was so amusing in {{her energy}} and precision, and her turns of speech, so {{deliberately}} homespun, as if she--than whom none could better use a stiff and polished phrase, or the refinements of the French language--were determined {{to take what}} liberties she liked. To the girl, haunted still by the feeling that she could fly, almost drunk on {{the sweetness of the}} air that summer morning, it seemed funny that anyone should be like that. Then for a second she saw her grandmother's face in repose, off guard, grim with anxious purpose, as if questioning its hold on life; and in one of those flashes of intuition which come to women--even when young and conquering like Barbara--she <b>felt</b> suddenly sorry, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> had caught sight of the pale spectre never yet seen by her. [...] "Poor old dear," [...] she thought; [...] "what a pity to be old!" ...|$|R
500|$|Her {{version of}} [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] {{garnered}} mostly negative reviews from music critics. Aside from comparisons to her previous singles [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] and her cover of Snow Patrol's [...] "Run", reviewers <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> was too emotive {{and did not}} reflect {{the simplicity of the}} original. Although the arrangement of the song was criticised, Lewis's vocal performance was highly praised. The song peaked at number 29 on the UK Singles Chart, number 11 on the UK R Chart and number 31 on the Irish Singles Chart. Lewis has performed the song live on the BBC Radio 2 show Live Sessions with Ken Bruce, MTV Unplugged and on the sixth series finale of The X Factor.|$|E
500|$|The {{number of}} cover songs, which play a {{prominent}} role in Carlile's live act, represented what she typically includes in a concert. Carlile said that she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> were a member of The Beatles when the audience stood and loudly sang the words to [...] "Dreams", and that [...] "Before It Breaks" [...] and [...] "I Will" [...] were emotionally the most difficult to perform. Carlile jokes with the audience between songs, which she felt was well-received, and requests their participation in three-part harmony during [...] "Turpentine". During the concert, the band experienced technical difficulties, and a bra thrown from the audience, intended for the drummer, hit Carlile on stage. Carlile said the [...] "rock 'n' roll symphony album" [...] was [...] "the meeting of two worlds, two different kinds of artists who got together for completely different reasons." [...] She has said that the album is the one she and her band are most proud of, believing it truly represents their live act.|$|E
500|$|Adele, who {{had just}} {{released}} her second album 21, admitted that initially she was a [...] "little hesitant" [...] about agreeing to write a Bond theme song. On meeting with the Skyfall film crew, the singer had told Skyfall director Sam Mendes that she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> was not the person {{that they were looking}} for because [...] "my songs are personal, I write from the heart". Mendes simply replied [...] "just write a personal song", telling her to use Carly Simon's [...] "Nobody Does It Better" [...] from The Spy Who Loved Me as an inspiration. Adele left the meeting with the script of Skyfall and, upon reading it, decided that it was a [...] "" [...] as she [...] "fell in love" [...] with the film's plot. Producer Paul Epworth, who had worked with Adele on 21, was brought in to help her write the song. Adele stated that she enjoyed working to a brief and set of guidelines, even though it was something she had never done before.|$|E
50|$|Quite a {{while later}} Liz has turned Eli's place into a sawmill {{where she lives}} with her young daughter. But Nathan turns up to arrest her. He tells her that it was The Reverend who {{instructed}} him to go to Bismuth to start a new life. He became a deputy and when the old sheriff died, the town chose him as the new one. He then found the 'Wanted Poster' of Elizabeth Brundy, a woman without a tongue. It turns out the original Elizabeth killed Frank, just before she turned up to save Liz/Joanna and Nathan is coming to take her back and hang her. As Nathan is escorting her off on a ferry, Liz looks at the unknowing Sam, who seems to be doing fine without her. Not wanting to be subjugated to the will of another once more, Liz decides to throw herself in the lake and drown.When Sam is a grown woman with a child of her own, she thinks of her mother. She has always <b>felt</b> her presence, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> was watching over her. As she is walking towards the house, it seems somebody watches her from the trees. Sam seems to feel it, looks towards the trees and smiles. She and her daughter go in.|$|R
60|$|On the Thursday {{following}} Mrs. McKeon {{and one of}} {{her daughters}} called at Ballycloran, and in spite of the bars and bolts with which the front door was barricaded, they contrived to make their way into Feemy's room. She remembered that Father John had told her that they would call on that day, and she was therefore prepared to receive them. Mrs. McKeon brought her some little comforts from Drumsna, of which she was sadly in want; for there was literally nothing at Ballycloran but what was supplied by the charity of those who pitied them in their misfortunes; and among other things she brought two or three volumes from the library. She was very kind to her, and did and said all in her power that could in any way console the poor girl. Though Father John had been gentle in his manners and had endeavoured to abstain from saying anything hard, still Mrs. McKeon was more successful in her way of explaining to Feemy what it was {{that she would have to}} do. She promised, moreover, to come to Ballycloran and fetch her, and to remain with her and support her during the whole of the painful time that she would either be in the court itself, or waiting in the neighbourhood till she should be called on to give her evidence. She did not allude either to the manner in which Feemy had left Drumsna, or to the suspicions which she had formerly expressed. Her whole object now was to relieve as much as possible the despondency and misery so plainly pictured in the poor girl's face. As she put her arm round her neck and kissed her lips, Feemy's heart yearned towards her new-found friend with a kind of tenderness she had never before <b>felt.</b> It was <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> for once experienced a mother's solicitude for her in her sorrows, and she longed to throw herself on her knees, hide her face in her friend's lap, and confess it all. Had she been alone with her she would have done so; but there sat Louey in the same room, and though her conduct to Feemy had been everything that was kind, she felt that it was not as if she had been absolutely alone with her mother. She could not at the same time confess her disgrace to two.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to {{the terrorist attacks on}} September 11, 2001; the United States <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> there was a fundamental misunderstanding of its policies in the Middle East.

2500|$|Ronstadt has {{remarked that}} she <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> was [...] "artificially {{encouraged}} to kinda cop {{a really tough}} attitude (and be tough) because rock and roll is kind of tough (business)," [...] which she felt wasn't worn quite authentically. Female rock artists like her and Janis Joplin, whom she described as lovely, shy, and very literate in real life and {{the antithesis of the}} [...] "red hot mamma" [...] she was artificially encouraged to project, went through an identity crisis.|$|E

6000|$|At that moment, Mrs Fyne {{told me she}} met the girl's eyes. There {{was that}} in them which made her shut her own.

60|$|Mrs. Bold felt {{it quite}} {{impossible}} to say anything in reply to this. Her blood was rushing about her body she knew not how or why.

60|$|It was a crowded, ill-lighted hall, barn-like in its proportions, and the smoke-laden air gave a {{peculiar}} distortion to everything. She <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> would stifle. There were shrill cries of boys selling programmes and soda water, {{and there was}} a great bass rumble of masculine voices. She heard a voice offering ten to six on Joe Fleming. The utterance was monotonous--hopeless, it seemed to her, and she felt a quick thrill. It was her Joe against whom everybody was to bet.|$|E
