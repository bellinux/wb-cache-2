Odour from pig production facilities is generated by the microbial conversion of feed in the large intestine of pigs and by the microbial conversion of pig excreta under anaerobic conditions and in manure stores. Assuming that primary odour-causing compounds arise from an excess of degradable protein {{and a lack of}} specific <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> during microbial fermentation, the main dietary components that can be altered to reduce odour are protein and <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrates.</b> In the present paper we aim to give an up-to-date review of studies on the relationship between diet composition and odour production, with the emphasis on protein and <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrates.</b> We hypothesise how odour might be changed and/or reduced by altering the diet of pigs.

50|$|Diet plays a {{key role}} in the process of dental caries. The type of foods along with the {{frequency}} at which they are consumed can determine the risk it puts for also developing carious lesions. With new products being put on supermarket shelves with irresistible prices, this can largely influence what people buy. It is common for infants and young children to frequently consume fermentable carbohydrates, in the form of liquids. The consumption of liquids containing <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrate,</b> include drinks such as: juice, breast milk, formula, soda. These consumables all have the potential to increase the risk of dental caries due to prolonged contact between sugars in the liquid and cariogenic bacteria on the tooth surface. Recent research has shown that breastfeeding does not increase caries risk up to 12 months of age. Poor feeding practices without appropriate preventive measures can lead to a distinctive pattern of caries in susceptible infants and toddlers commonly known as baby bottle tooth decay or ECC. Frequent and long duration bottle feeding, especially at night, is associated with ECC. This finding can be attributed to the fact that there is less salivary flow at night and hence less capacity for buffering and remineralisation. Each time a child drinks these liquids, acids attack for 20 minutes or longer. A parent's education and health awareness has a major influence on the caries experience of their child - feeding practices, dietary habits and food choices.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Dietary supplementation with <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> {{protects against}} body weight gain. Fermentation by the {{resident}} gut microbiota produces short-chain fatty acids, which act at {{free fatty acid}} receptor 2 (FFAR 2). Our aim was {{to test the hypothesis}} that FFAR 2 is important in regulating the beneficial effects of <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> on body weight and to understand the role of gut hormones PYY and GLP- 1. Methods: Wild-type or Ffar 2 −/− mice were fed an inulin supplemented or control diet. Mice were metabolically characterized and gut hormone concentrations, enteroendocrine cell density measurements were carried out. Intestinal organoids and colonic cultures were utilized to substantiate the in vivo findings. Results: We provide new mechanistic insight into how <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> regulates metabolism. Using mice that lack FFAR 2, we demonstrate that the <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> inulin acts via this receptor to drive an 87 % increase in the density of cells that produce the appetite-suppressing hormone peptide YY (PYY), reduce food intake, and prevent diet-induced obesity. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that FFAR 2 is predominantly involved in regulating the effects of <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> on metabolism and does so, in part, by enhancing PYY cell density and release. This highlights the potential for targeting enteroendocrine cell differentiation to treat obesity...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} ability of <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> to stimulate {{anorectic}} gut hormones, which in turn reduce appetite and body weight. <b>Fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> {{have been shown to}} suppress food intake and body weight in rodents via the release of satiety hormones, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP- 1) and peptide-YY (PYY). However, evidence of the effect of <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> on modulating body weight in humans is contradictory. In this thesis, supplementing oligofructose over eight weeks has been shown to significantly reduce hunger and increase PYY secretion in overweight volunteers. However, there was no suppression on energy intake or body weight when compared with cellulose supplementation. Studies in rodents also suggested that reductions in food intake and body weight following intake of <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> are associated with activation in the central nervous system. In contrast, oligofructose supplementation in this study had no significant effect on reducing activation in pre-selected brain reward regions in response to visual food cues, as measured by functional MRI. Surprisingly, the activation in these brain regions was reduced by cellulose intake. The negative findings from the oligofructose study may be due to insufficient concentrations of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon. SCFAs, the fermentation end-products of ingested <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> are thought to {{play a significant role in}} modifying energy homeostasis by stimulating PYY and GLP- 1 from enteroendocrine L-cells in the colon. By applying a novel method of delivering propionate to the colon using a propionate carrier molecule (PCM), it has been shown that supplementation with PCM in healthy lean volunteers reduced hunger and energy intake in pilot studies via elevated PYY secretion.

40|$|Background Indigestible, {{fermentable}} carbohydrates are bioactive dietary carbohydrates not digested {{by human}} enzymes but are fermented into short chain fatty acids and gases by colonic bacteria. These carbohydrates display prebiotic effects and may influence {{body mass index}} (BMI), glucose regulation, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol. However, intakes of fermentable carbohydrates have not been explored in the general US population and potential metabolic effects have not been well elucidated. The purpose of this cross-sectional {{study was to examine}} consumption of total fermentable carbohydrates and subclasses, oligosaccharides and polyols, in US college students (n= 359, body fat= 25. 4 ± 9. 3 %, 83 % female) and potential health differences between high and low consumers. ^ Methods Intake of total fermentable carbohydrates, oligosaccharides, polyols and their subclasses were quantified by the Comprehensive Nutrition Assessment Questionnaire. Subjects were classified into lower median (LM) and upper median (UM) groups using median split for total grams consumed and grams consumed per 1000 kcal diet (g/ 1000 kcal). Blood glucose and lipids were measured by Cholestech LDX®, body fat percent by BODPOD®, and waist circumference and blood pressure by standardized instruments and protocols. Median differences in dependent variables were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and covariance (ANCOVA). ^ Results Average <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> intake was 8. 0 ± 4. 9 grams with approximately even amounts coming from oligosaccharides and polyols. The LM for total grams of <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> had higher BMI (24. 4 ± 4. 6 vs. 23. 3 ± 3. 7 kg/m 2 respectively; p=. 022), body fat percent (26. 6 ± 9. 8 vs. 24. 1 ± 8. 5 %; p=. 016), and blood glucose (84 ± 8 vs. 82 ± 7 mg/dL; p=. 024) than the respective UM. Using ANCOVA, the LM had higher systolic blood pressure than the UM (117 ± 14 vs. 114 ± 14 mmHg; p=. 028). Findings were similar with <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> expressed as g/ 1000 kcal. Using ANCOVA, the LM for OS as g/ 1000 kcal had higher BMI (p=. 021) and systolic blood pressure (p=. 036) than the UM. The LM for polyols as g/ 1000 kcal had higher diastolic blood pressure than the UM (p=. 045). ^ Conclusion <b>Fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> intake was low in this population. However, within this range, results suggest higher intake may impact BMI, blood glucose, and blood pressure in healthy US college students.

40|$|Two {{contradictory}} hypotheses on {{the role}} of dietary carbohydrates in health and disease shape how dental-systemic associations are regarded. On one side, Cleave and Yudkin postulated that excessive dietary <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> intake led—in the absence of dental interventions such as fluorides— first to dental diseases and then to systemic dis-eases. Under this hypothesis, dental and systemic diseases shared—as a common cause—a diet of excess fermentable carbohydrates. Dental diseases were regarded as an alarm bell for future systemic diseases, and restricting carbohydrate intake pre-vented both dental and systemic diseases. On the opposite side, Keys postulated the lipid hypothe-sis: that excessive dietary lipid intake caused systemic diseases. Keys advocated a diet high in <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrate</b> for the benefit of general health, and dental diseases became regarded as local dietary side effects. Because general health takes precedence over dental health when it comes to dietary recommendations, dental diseases became viewed as local infections; interventions such as fluorides, sealants, oral hygiene, antimicrobials, and dental fillings became synonymous with main-taining dental health, and carbohydrates were no longer considered as a common cause for dental-systemic diseases. These opposing dietary hypoth-eses have increasingly been put to the test in clinical trials. The emerging trial results favor Cleave-Yudkin’s hypothesis and may affect preventive approaches for dental and systemic diseases.

50|$|The primary cariogenic {{bacteria}} {{involved in}} ECC is S. Mutans and Lactobacillus. The oral flora in an infant oral cavity is not colonised with normal oral flora until {{the eruption of}} the primary dentition at approximately 6 to 30 months of age. The colonisation of S.

In plaque, the cariogenic microorganisms are those that produce lactic acid as a by-product from <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrates.</b> Examples of these <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrates</b> include such as fructose, sucrose and glucose. Cariogenic bacteria thrive on these sugars and help them to weaken the adjacent tooth surface.

S. mutans used GlcNAc at concentrations of up to 10 mM to increase cell numbers, but S. sobrinus was unable to ferment the amino sugar alone and its uptake only occurred {{in the presence of a}} <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrate.</b> GlcNAc had a marked inhibitory effect on the ability of S. sobrinus to produce lactic acid from glucose, sucrose, and fructose, at the same time increasing the lag period and doubling time of batch-grown cells. Such patterns of inhibition were found with S. mutans, but the effects were less than those seen in S. sobrinus. In mixed culture studies of the two species, S. sobrinus became the predominant organism when 10 mM glucose was supplied as the sole <b>fermentable</b> <b>carbohydrate,</b> with a concomitant decrease in the numbers of S. mutans cells, but supplementation of the broth with 10 mM glucose and 10 mM GlcNAc resulted in the emergence of S. mutans as the predominant organism. S. mutans and S. sobrinus grown in media containing glucose possessed the ability to transport glucose and GlcNAc, probably via the same glucose-phosphotransferase system at similar rates. However, intracellular levels of N-acetylglucosamine- 6 -phosphate deacetylase and glucosamine- 6 -phosphate deaminase were markedly higher in S. mutans grown on glucose and GlcNAc than in S. sobrinus: 34 and 398 and 8 and 17 nmol of NADPH formed per mi per mg of protein for S. mutans and S. sobrinus, respectively. We propose that GlcNAc inhibited growth of S. sobrinus in media containing glucose and GlcNAc by competing with glucose for the glucose phosphotransferase, depleting intracellular levels of phosphoenolpyruvate, and possessing, in contrast to S. mutans, low levels of N-acetyl-glucosamine- 6 -phosphate deacetylase and glucosamine- 6 -phosphate deaminase activity. Together, these data suggest that in dental plaque, S. sobrinus when exposed to GlcNAc will have a reduced ability to compete with S. mutans for dietary carbohydrates, contributing to the greater frequency of isolation of S. mutans from human populations...|$|E

To further elucidate the role of NeuNAc in supporting growth, this study determined the ability of S. oralis strain AR 3 (isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis) to transport NeuNAc and characterised the transport system. The transport of [14 C]-labelled NeuNAc into S. oralis was monitored and this transport system was induced by growth of the bacteria in the presence of the N-acetylated sugars NeuNAc, N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmannosamine. The transport system followed typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a K, of 2 1. 0, ~ ~ and a Vmax of 2. 65 nmoles of NeuNAc transported/min/mg of dry cell mass. NeuNAc transport was inhibited by the presence of exogenous N-glycolylneuraminic acid, a related sialic acid.
