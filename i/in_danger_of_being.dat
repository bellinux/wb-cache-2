5|$|At one point, {{the prices}} for his {{pictures}} were exceeded only {{by those of}} renowned English artists Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. Despite his many commissions, however, Stuart was habitually neglectful of finances and was <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> sent to debtors' prison. In 1787, he fled to Dublin, Ireland where he painted and accumulated debt with equal vigor.|$|E
5|$|Although Z. Marcas {{features}} {{characters from}} other Balzac stories and elements of literary realism– both hallmarks of Balzac's style– it is remembered primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a legitimist, believed that France's lack of bold leadership {{had led to}} mediocrity and ruin, and that men of quality were being ignored or worse. He maintained that the youth of France were <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest {{in the years to}} come.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of Highbury was {{restricted}} because the East Stand had been {{designated as a}} Grade II listed building {{and the other three}} stands were close to residential properties. These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> left behind in the football boom of that time.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the change}} in Code Letters in 1934, Centaur was {{allocated}} the Code Letters GMQP. A highlight of Centaurs pre-war career was the rescue of the 385ton Japanese whale-chaser Kyo Maru II in November 1938. Kyo Maru II had developed boiler problems while returning from the Antarctic and was drifting towards the Houtman Abrolhos Archipelago, where she was <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> wrecked by the reefs in the area. Centaur responded to the distress signal and towed Kyo Maru II to Geraldton.|$|E

He re-enlisted in the summer and played for a military team at Marine Corps Base Quantico later in the year. After the season, he was named the best service player in the country by the Washington Touchdown Club.|$|E
5|$|In September 1943, word reached Bohr in Denmark {{that the}} Nazis {{considered}} {{his family to}} be Jewish, {{and that they were}} <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September 1943. When the news of Bohr's escape reached Britain, Lord Cherwell sent a telegram asking Bohr to come to Britain. Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a de Havilland Mosquito operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC).|$|E

5|$|On 17 August 1944, Model {{received}} from Hitler Diamonds {{to go with}} his Knight's Cross with Oakleaves and Swords, in reward for his shoring up of the Eastern Front. Simultaneously, he {{was transferred to the}} west, replacing Kluge as commander-in-chief of Army Group B and OB West. The front in Normandy had collapsed after nearly two months of severe fighting, the U.S. Third Army was driving for the Seine, and an Army group was <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> annihilated in the Falaise pocket.|$|E

5|$|Although Richard sought {{peace with}} France, {{he took a}} {{different}} approach to the situation in Ireland. The English lordships in Ireland were <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> overrun, and the Anglo-Irish lords were pleading for the king to intervene. In the autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages. The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship. It {{was one of the most}} successful achievements of Richard's reign, and strengthened the king's support at home, although the consolidation of the English position in Ireland proved to be short-lived.|$|E

5|$|By 13 August, the {{offensive}} had fully halted, with German forces being {{driven out of}} Mortain. The Germans had lost 120 tanks and assault guns to Allied counter-attacks and air strikes, {{more than two-thirds of}} their committed total. As Hitler ordered German forces in Normandy to hold their positions, the U.S. VII and XV Corps were swinging east and north toward Argentan. The German attack west left the 7th Army and Panzergruppe West <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> encircled by Allied forces. As American forces advanced on Argentan, British and Canadian forces advanced on Falaise, threatening to cut off both armies in the newly formed Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|In Chicago, Madonna's father Tony Ciccone is {{interviewed in}} his vineyard; he recalls Madonna's childhood. Ciccone {{and his wife}} Joan come to visit the singer at her concert in United Center. The entourage moves to Miami where Ritchie is shown angling with their son Rocco, plays with her {{daughter}} Lourdes, and Madonna reflects on relationships and her husband. By the time the tour reaches London, Madonna gets irritated with the journeys. Kabbalah comes into the picture with explanations of the mystical practice from Madonna and her teacher Eitan. At Slane Castle, Dublin, Madonna and her dancers were <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> electrocuted due to constant rain, but she nevertheless continued the performances.|$|E
5|$|In December 1987, the Conservancy {{performed}} one of {{its first}} breed rescues when it removed a viable population of Santa Cruz sheep from Santa Cruz Island. The sheep were <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> eradicated by The Nature Conservancy, which was working to save indigenous vegetation that the breed used as food. The first twelve lambs {{were removed from the}} island in 1988, with further animals brought to the mainland in 1991. The population now stands at 125 animals and is considered an important genetic resource due to its island heritage, which kept it isolated from other breeds and forced it to adapt to adverse conditions.|$|E

5|$|Lewis Hamilton set {{the pace}} in Q2, seven-tenths of a second ahead of Rosberg. Kimi Räikkönen was <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> {{eliminated}} {{for the majority of}} the session, as he spun while preparing for his first timed lap and then ran wide over the track limits on his second attempt, but managed to proceed into Q3 with his third fast lap. He initially demoted Fernando Alonso outside the top ten with his time, but the McLaren driver hit back with a time sufficient to move on. This left Magnussen, Daniil Kvyat, Gutiérrez, Romain Grosjean, Felipe Massa, and Sergio Pérez on the sidelines for Q3.|$|E
5|$|Norgrove {{was removed}} from the scene via {{helicopter}} and received medical care, but she died. It was reported initially that she had been killed by one of her captors setting off a suicide vest. According to The Guardian, insurgents often put on suicide vests if they think they are <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> attacked. Taliban commanders Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan (who were holding Norgrove) were among those killed in the raid, according to an Afghan intelligence official. Other women and children in the compound were uninjured, and no members of the rescue team were wounded.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July, as the {{squadron}} neared Rochefort, it was spotted by HMS Mars, a Royal Navy ship {{of the line}} stationed off the port to intercept French ships entering or leaving. Signalling {{to the rest of}} the British squadron, Captain Robert Dudley Oliver took Mars in pursuit, chasing the French squadron all through the night and into the next morning, by which time the frigate Rhin had fallen far behind the others. Recognising that Rhin was <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> captured, Lamellerie turned back to her defence with his main squadron but then changed his mind, turning once more and retreating to Rochefort as Oliver took possession of the heavily outgunned Rhin.|$|E

5|$|On the division's right, Tabu-dong was in North Korean hands, on {{the left}} Waegwan was a no-man's land, {{and in the center}} strong North Korean forces were infiltrating southward from Hill 518. The 7th Cavalry Regiment in the center could no longer use the Waegwan-Tabu-dong lateral supply road behind it, and was <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> surrounded. After {{discussing}} a withdrawal plan with Walker, on September 5 Gay issued an order for a general withdrawal of the 1st Cavalry Division during the night to shorten the lines and to occupy a better defensive position.|$|E
5|$|Once it {{was clear}} that U.S. {{territory}} was not <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> attacked by enemy air units, Saville's expertise in air defense was not needed. In March 1943, he was made director of tactical development at the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) at Orlando, Florida, where he reorganized the Army Air Forces Board by July 2, 1943. Saville's structure put tactical and strategic development on equal footing, and tied together the efforts of the Chief of Air Staff for Operations, Commitments, and Requirements (OC), the Proving Ground Command and the School of Applied Tactics. Saville charged the AAFSAT with developing air defense doctrines and tactics, and with the testing of air defense equipment and methods.|$|E
5|$|Raw {{subsequently}} {{served in}} staff and diplomatic roles until 1965, {{when he took}} command of No. 82 Wing. Between May 1966 and April 1967, he served as the air support coordinator for the Australian forces in South Vietnam; his initial refusal to commit RAAF helicopters to assist the Australian Army force that was <b>in</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> defeated during the Battle of Long Tan in August 1966 generated lasting controversy. Raw served in various staff and training positions until 1972, when he was appointed the commander of RAAF Base Butterworth. He returned to Australia in 1976 and retired from the RAAF two years later.|$|E
