40|$|AbstractPeroxisomal ABC {{transporters}} {{of animals}} and fungi are “half-size” proteins which dimerise to form a functional transporter. However, peroxisomal ABC transporters of land plants are synthesised as a single polypeptide which represents a fused heterodimer. The N- and C-terminal pseudo-halves of COMATOSE (CTS; AtABCD 1) were expressed as separate polypeptides which bound Pex 19 in vitro and targeted independently to the peroxisome membrane in yeast, where they were stable but not functional. When co-expressed, the pseudo-halves were fully functional as indicated by ATPase activity and rescue of the pxa 1 pxa 2 Δ mutant for growth on oleate. The functional significance of heterodimer asymmetry is discussed.

40|$|AbstractHere {{we report}} a {{regulatory}} {{mechanism by which}} LKB 1 is controlled by 14 - 3 - 3 proteins through phorsphorylation of Thr 336. The results from the current study indicate that 14 - 3 - 3 ζ inhibits LKB 1 from phosphorylating its substrate, AMPK (AMP-dependent protein kinase) and attenuates LKB 1 -mediated G 1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by interfering with the interaction between LKB 1 and its substrates. This regulation does not change either the LKB 1 catalytic activity or subcellular localization of LKB 1. Moreover, we demonstrate that serum starvation enhances LKB 1 activity and increases the phosphorylation of Thr 336. Taken together, our results suggest that autophosphorylation of Thr 336 acts as an activating signal for LKB 1 to recruit 14 - 3 - 3, which in turn attenuates the activation of LKB 1 to keep the activity of LKB 1 in check.

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{the precise}} {{intracellular}} roles of S 100 proteins {{are not fully}} understood, these proteins {{are thought to be}} involved in Ca 2 +-dependent diverse signal transduction pathways. In this report, we identified importin α as a novel target of S 100 A 6. Importin α contains armadillo repeats, essential for binding to nuclear localization signals. Based on the results from GST pull-down assay, gel-shift assay, and co-immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that S 100 A 6 specifically interacts with the armadillo repeats of importin α in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner, resulting in inhibition of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) -importin α complex formation in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate S 100 A 6 may regulate the nuclear transport of NLS-cargos in response to increasing concentrations of intracellular Ca 2 +.

In this study, we analyzed {{the interplay between}} the cpSRP pathway components, the substrate protein LHCP and the translocase Alb 3 by using in vivo and in vitro techniques. We propose that cpSRP 43 is crucial for the binding of LHCP-loaded cpSRP and cpFtsY to Alb 3.
