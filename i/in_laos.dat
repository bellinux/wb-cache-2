5|$|The {{most senior}} {{military}} officer in-country was the AIRA, the ambassador's air attaché, an Air Force colonel. The air attaché office originally consisted of that officer {{and six other}} personnel. The burgeoning air programs <b>in</b> <b>Laos</b> however, dictated the dispatch of 117 more Air Force personnel during 1966. The Air Force conducted its operations {{under the aegis of}} Project 404, whose mission was to support the Royal Laotian military, the clandestine Hmong army, and to support project personnel, who coordinated the operational end of covert activities <b>in</b> <b>Laos.</b> Eventually, five air operations centers were created <b>in</b> <b>Laos</b> – at Vientiane, Pakse, Savannakhet, Long Tieng, and Luang Prabang. These centers supported the ambassador with intelligence, administrative services, and communications as well as the actual air operations under a program called Palace Dog.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1968, the {{physical}} barrier concept was pushed aside after the North Vietnamese overran the Lang Vei Special Forces camp and besieged Khe Sanh.

5|$|On the {{previous}} day, the three airmen from the squadron had scouted the target area south of Tchepone in a two engine CIA aircraft piloted by a civilian employee. The pilot {{had failed to}} load enough fuel on the reconnaissance aircraft and had to refuel at a Laotian base on the return trip to Udorn. Since United States armed forces personnel were never officially acknowledged as being <b>in</b> <b>Laos,</b> the United States Ambassador to Laos became enraged that U.S. personnel had been spotted in uniform at the remote refueling field <b>in</b> <b>Laos.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Ravens were {{volunteer}} Air Force {{officers who}} already had 500 flying hours (six months) as FACs in South Vietnam and who would serve six-month tours <b>in</b> <b>Laos.</b> There were {{always going to be}} shortages of both personnel and aircraft in the new program. Only six Ravens were assigned between 1966 and 1968 to control the ever-expanding amounts of U.S. airpower being utilized <b>in</b> <b>Laos.</b> Even {{at the height of the}} program, when they would control one-third to two-thirds of the tactical air strikes in the Barrel Roll area, there were never more than 22 Ravens.|$|E
5|$|Electronic {{tactical}} {{air navigation}} (TACAN) became an absolute necessity <b>in</b> <b>Laos,</b> where mountain peaks and unexpected inclement weather made flying extremely hazardous, especially for older aircraft. This problem was solved by establishing unmanned Air Force stations that broadcast continuous radio transmissions, allowing aerial navigation from fixed geographic reference points. The Air Force also emplaced TSQ-81 radar {{sites in the}} north and northeast to direct Rolling Thunder missions over North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February, Souvanna {{signed an}} Agreement on the Restoration of Peace and Reconciliation <b>in</b> <b>Laos</b> between the central {{government}} and the Pathet Lao. The agreement was preceded by intense fighting, as both sides attempted to seize as much territory as possible before the cease-fire went into effect. The agreement was moot, however, since Hanoi {{had no intention of}} removing its troops or abandoning its logistical system.|$|E

5|$|On the ground, the CIA and the Royal Lao Army had {{initially}} {{been given the}} responsibility of stopping, slowing, or, at the very least, observing the enemy's infiltration effort. <b>In</b> <b>Laos</b> the agency began Operation Pincushion in 1962 for that reason. The operation evolved into Operation Hardnose, in which CIA-backed Laotian irregular reconnaissance team operations took place.|$|E
5|$|Secord's {{fears were}} justified, as USAF {{reconnaissance}} aircraft regularly flying over northeastern Laos in 1967 {{revealed that the}} paved roads constructed by the North Vietnamese were obviously approaching Phou Pha Thi. Road constructing activities were observed along Routes 6 and 19, which connected Dien Bien Phu in North Vietnam with Phou Pha Thi and Nam Bac <b>in</b> <b>Laos.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since {{the fate}} of Laos did not depend on a {{military}} solution in the air or on the ground <b>in</b> <b>Laos</b> and could only {{be decided by the}} outcome in Vietnam, winning the war against the DRV in northern Laos was not the objective. Instead, maintaining access to the country was paramount and keeping the Royal Lao government in power became the primary objective.|$|E

5|$|The American {{official}} most {{associated with}} the conflict <b>in</b> <b>Laos</b> was Ambassador William H. Sullivan, who served from December 1964 until June 1969. He {{was also one of}} the most controversial. Considered brilliant by most and tyrannical by many, Sullivan was despised by the American high command (both Army and Air Force) in Saigon, Sullivan's demand that he alone maintain complete control over every aspect of American military operations <b>in</b> <b>Laos</b> and the stringent restrictions that he imposed upon those operations, earned him few friends among the military. Few of his detractors, however, considered the difficulties of the ambassador's position. He had to balance the competing interests of the CIA, the Seventh Air Force, MACV, and the Thais, and this had to be done without alienating Souvanna Phouma, an ally in all but name who acquiesced to almost every U.S. action within his country, short of outright invasion.|$|E
5|$|The Cooper–Church Amendment was resurrected {{during the}} winter and {{incorporated}} into the Supplementary Foreign Assistance Act of 1970. This time the measure made it through both houses of Congress and became law on 22 December. As a result, all U.S. ground troops and advisors were barred from participating in military actions <b>in</b> <b>Laos</b> or Cambodia, while the air war being conducted in both countries by the U.S. Air Force was ignored.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} been {{recorded}} in at least 6national parks and 12nature reserves. In China, Daweishan, Fenshuiling, and Huanglianshan Reserve maintained approximately 80% of that country's population of the species in 2007. However, the species is still vulnerable to hunting, even in protected areas. <b>In</b> <b>Laos,</b> the species {{has been recorded}} in seven National Biodiversity Conservation Areas.|$|E
