Some of its earlier members such as Jurgis Dobkevičius and Antanas Gustaitis were instrumental in improving on aeronautical designs.

5|$|In {{addition}} to his management of the proprietary, Martin began taking {{an active role in}} political and civil affairs within his uncle's domain. Following an act of the Virginia General Assembly in February 1752, the Anglican Frederick Parish was authorized to hold an election for twelve parish vestrymen before June 15 of that year. Martin was elected as a vestryman, alongside his uncle Lord Fairfax and Gabriel Jones. Martin and his fellow vestrymen set about <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> enlarging the Anglican presence within the parish.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Tet Offensive, the North Vietnamese showed signs of <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> modernizing their {{logistical}} effort. The number of supply and maintenance personnel had fallen, mainly due to increased use of motor/river transportation and mechanized construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year that the 559th Group was using 20 bulldozers, 11 road graders, three rock crushers, and two steamrollers for maintenance and new road construction.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones breed by {{liberating}} {{sperm and}} eggs through the mouth into the sea. The resulting fertilized eggs develop into planula larvae which, after being planktonic for a while, {{settle on the}} seabed and develop directly into juvenile polyps. Sea anemones also breed asexually, by breaking in half or into smaller pieces which regenerate into polyps. Sea anemones are sometimes kept in reef aquariums; the global trade in marine ornamentals for this purpose is <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> threatens sea anemone populations in some localities, as the trade depends on collection from the wild.|$|E

The Phillips building at No.101 is still used for auctions; the company was bought in 2001 by Bonhams, who spent £30million <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> refurbishing the premises. In 2015, Valentino announced plans to build a new flagship store on Old Bond Street.|$|E

Star then produced a sequel to Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman, again with Wu at the helm, and drew the journalist Saeroen as writer. In this film, titled Pah Wongso Tersangka, Star emphasised comedy, relying on the interactions between Waldy, Pah Wongso, and the comedian Sarip.|$|E

5|$|Born in Huntington on Long Island, Whitman {{worked as}} a journalist, a teacher, a {{government}} clerk, and—in addition to publishing his poetry—was a volunteer nurse during the American Civil War. Early in his career, he also produced a temperance novel, Franklin Evans (1842). Whitman's major work, Leaves of Grass, {{was first published in}} 1855 with his own money. The work was an attempt at reaching out to the common person with an American epic. He continued <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> revising it until his death in 1892. After a stroke towards the end of his life, he moved to Camden, New Jersey, where his health further declined. When he died at age 72, his funeral became a public spectacle.|$|E
5|$|Construction on {{the second}} {{platform}}, an island platform connected via a pedestrian overpass, began in January 2014 with the closure of Mukilteo Lane near the station. Part of the existing North Platform was closed {{for use as a}} staging area in March 2014, <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> contracting before and after rush hour, respectively. The $11 million project, designed by AECOM and HNTB in 2012, was originally scheduled to be completed in 2015. Delays in construction, including state approval of the new elevators, pushed back the completion date to April 2016. As part of the STart program, a percentage of construction funds went towards installing art made by Whidbey Island resident Linda Beaumont at the station.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the decline}} in burials from an already low level, rising land values in the post war years meant that the LNC was a {{valuable}} and successful company. In the 1940s it bought {{out a number of}} other firms of funeral directors, particularly those catering for the <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> prosperous suburbs of south west London within easy reach of Brookwood by road. The LNC continued to lobby the SR and its 1948 successor British Railways until the 1950s on the matter of cheap fares for visitors to the cemetery, but were unable to come to any agreement. In 1957 the Southern Region of British Railways considered allowing the LNC to sell discounted fares of 7s6d (compared to the standard rate of 9s4d) for return tickets for same-day travel from London to Brookwood and back. By this time most visitors to the cemetery were travelling by road. The LNC felt that the relatively minor difference between the fares would not be sufficient to attract visitors back to the railway, and the proposal was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–1567), the native Chinese {{ideology}} of Daoism was fully sponsored at the Ming court, while Tibetan Vajrayana and even Chinese Buddhism were ignored or suppressed. Even the History of Ming states that the Tibetan lamas discontinued their trips to Ming China and its court at this point. Grand Secretary Yang Tinghe under Jiajing was determined to break the eunuch influence at court which typified the Zhengde era, an example being the costly escort of the eunuch Liu Yun as described above in his failed mission to Tibet. The court eunuchs were in favor of <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> building new commercial ties with foreign countries such as Portugal, which Zhengde deemed permissible since he had an affinity for foreign and exotic people.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} the {{population}} of the nearby village of Burnside was <b>expanding</b> <b>and</b> required a new water supply. First Creekwhich runs down Waterfall Gully and enters the River Torrens near today's Botanic Gardenswas seen as the perfect solution to the water shortage. A weir was built during 1881 and 1882, and was made to hold approximately two megalitres (530,000USgallons) of water. A pipeline was constructed to the reservoir at Burnside South, and from there the water was used throughout the surrounding area. As a side effect, the weir also reduced the volume of water available to the local market gardeners, and over many years that aspect of the region disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, {{both he and}} his wife had been pushed to their {{emotional}} limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. As a product of a childhood that could well be described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found it increasingly difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also <b>expanding,</b> <b>and</b> he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E
