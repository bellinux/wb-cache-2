5|$|Black {{comes to}} in a {{hospital}} bed, tended to by his wife Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher). She explains to him what has happened, and turns {{on the evening news}} to show him the interview with his rescuer. However, watching Dees speak, Black quickly realises he is the bomber. The FBI locate Dees' home, but his electronic surveillance had alerted <b>him</b> <b>long</b> before, and he has escaped before they even arrive. However, as Black sits in his car, he receives a call from Dees, who has booby-trapped the car. The FBI are able to monitor this call with Dees' equipment. Dees tells Black that they will both soon be famous, letting Black know that he has a remote detonator for the car's explosives. Before he can use it, he is killed by a police marksman.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm tells Adrienne about {{a ritual}} that can {{eradicate}} the demon. Harriet, fearing for her safety, decides {{to leave with}} Cyrus as Don becomes more abusive and erratic. The next day, Adrienne is attacked by Don, who is now completely insane and dressed like Carno. Adrienne scars Don's face with acid from his darkroom and then flees, discovering the corpses of Mike, Harriet and Cyrus hidden throughout the mansion. Don captures Adrienne and straps her into the throne, but she distracts <b>him</b> <b>long</b> enough to free herself and trigger the swinging axe, which impales and kills Don. His death unleashes the demon, a huge and murderous monster that pursues Adrienne through the mansion. She escapes long enough to perform a ritual that traps the demon once again. The game ends with Adrienne {{walking out of the}} mansion with a vacant stare, almost catatonic.|$|E
5|$|While Dredd {{works his}} way towards Ma-Ma, she {{calls in the}} corrupt Judges Lex, Kaplan, Chan and Alvarez. The four relieve Volt and Guthrie from duty and are allowed into the building. Dredd {{encounters}} Chan and is suspicious {{that he does not}} ask about Anderson's status. Seeing his cover blown, Chan attacks Dredd, but is killed. Meanwhile, Kay tries to execute Anderson with her own weapon, but the pistol's DNA scanner does not recognise him and explodes, taking his arm off. She escapes and later encounters Kaplan, whom she promptly kills after reading Kaplan's mind. Elsewhere, Dredd kills Alvarez but runs out of ammunition, and is shot by Lex in the abdomen. Lex moves in to execute Dredd, but Dredd stalls <b>him</b> <b>long</b> enough for Anderson to arrive and kill Lex.|$|E
60|$|Well, never mind! The {{description}} sounds excellently; almost over-romantic, though. Is there steadiness, do you think, and depth, and reliableness altogether? What impression does he make {{among those}} who have known <b>him</b> <b>longest?</b> Dearest Fanny, do nothing in haste.|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} match on the {{pay-per-view}} {{portion of the}} show, Daniel Bryan faced Triple H; the winner would be inserted in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship main event later that night. Triple H was announced and accompanied by Stephanie McMahon. Bryan kicked away Triple H's handshake and started the match strongly, including performing a tornado DDT off the apron. Triple H gained the advantage by driving Bryan's injured arm into the announce table and continually attacking the arm including a hammerlock belly-to-back suplex on the apron. Bryan refused to submit to Triple H's submission holds of the crossface chickenwing and a regular crossface, instead reversing to his signature Yes! Lock, but Triple H reached the ropes to break the hold. Triple H countered Bryan's signature running knee with a spinebuster and his signature Pedigree maneuver, but Bryan kicked out at two. After another series of counters, Bryan hit his running knee for the three count and the win. After the match, McMahon slapped Bryan, distracting <b>him</b> <b>long</b> enough for Triple H to attack him from behind. Triple H placed Bryan's injured arm against the ring post and hit it with a steel folding chair. Bryan had to be attended to by medical staff while Triple H and McMahon celebrated on the stage.|$|E
25|$|The {{nutcracker}} {{appears to}} lead the soldiers, who are joined by tin ones and dolls who serve as doctors to carry away the wounded.

25|$|The {{twins were}} removed from their mother's care in 2003 and placed with their father, Victor Bustillo, {{but they did not}} stay with <b>him</b> <b>long.</b> In 2004 he was charged with sexual battery of a child not in his care. The twins were placed in foster care, and {{eventually}} ended up in the home of Jorge and Carmen Barahona in Miami, Florida. The couple had already adopted a boy with autism. Jorge owned a pest control business; Carmen was a homemaker.|$|E

25|$|The group {{heads back}} to the Citadel, but they are {{attacked}} en route by Joe's forces, and Furiosa is seriously wounded. Joe positions his {{car in front of}} the War Rig to slow it, while Max fights Joe's giant son, Rictus Erectus. Joe captures Toast, who manages to distract <b>him</b> <b>long</b> enough for Furiosa to kill him. Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the Rig, killing Rictus and blocking the canyon, allowing Max, Furiosa, the wives, and the surviving Vuvalini to escape in Joe's car, where Max transfuses his blood to Furiosa, saving her life.|$|E

Several years later, Harry marries Jeanne after he passes his medical exams and joins his father's practice. Virginie marries one of Harry's brothers, Tom, and the girls and their husbands later travel back to France for a short time to stay with Marie and Victor, who, after fighting in the French army under Napoleon, purchases the chateau that once belonged to the Marquis de St. Caux.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Tiner {{opined that}} {{retiring}} U.S. Senator Russell B. Long may have stepped aside from seeking a seventh full six-year term because Long {{may have been}} unseated by Republican U.S. Representative Henson Moore of Baton Rouge. Long's successor, John Breaux, also a U.S. representative at the time from Crowley, however, defeated Moore in the general election. Moore had led in the nonpartisan blanket primary. Long said that he merely {{wanted to have a}} few years of retirement while the calendar was still somewhat favorable to <b>him.</b> <b>Long</b> lived until 2003.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} it was not {{sufficient}} for the husband simply to say to his wife (in the presence of two witnesses) not to converse with a man. And if she nonetheless conversed with him, she was still permitted to her husband and (if a daughter of a Kohen) still permitted to eat from sacrifices. If, however, she entered a private place with the man and stayed with <b>him</b> <b>long</b> enough to have committed misconduct, she was forbidden to her husband and forbidden to eat from sacrifices, and if her husband died, she was required to perform the ceremony of halizah and could not contract a levirate marriage.|$|E

At his death, his hair was cut off and maintained by tribal leaders. The long lock of hair is now held by the Chief Plenty Coups State Park at Pryor, Montana.|$|E
25|$|When Sobhraj's {{sentence}} was to end, the 20-year Thai arrest warrant against him {{would still have}} been valid, thereby affecting his extradition and almost certain execution. So in March 1986, in his tenth year in prison, he threw a big party for his guards and fellow inmates, drugged them with sleeping pills {{and walked out of}} the jail. Inspector Madhukar Zende of the Mumbai police apprehended Sobhraj in O'Coquero Restaurant in Goa; his prison term was prolonged by ten years, just as he had hoped. On 17 February 1997, 52-year-old Sobhraj was released with most warrants, evidence and even witnesses against <b>him</b> <b>long</b> lost. Without any country to extradite him to, Indian authorities let him return to France.|$|E

25|$|On September 4, 2015, the Lightning {{announced}} that Andrei Vasilevskiy had undergone surgery {{the day before}} to remove a blood clot near his collarbone. Vasilevskiy arrived in Tampa this week reporting swelling in his upper left arm. Vasilevskiy {{was sent to the}} doctor as a precaution, where he was diagnosed with a type of thoracic outlet syndrome, which is a condition considered rare among hockey players. Lightning General Manager, Steve Yzerman, was encouraged that Vasilevskiy's surgery would not effect <b>him</b> <b>long</b> term. Dr. Karl Illig said that 90 to 95 percent of people get back to being a high level athlete. The prognosis for Vasilevskiy's recovery is between two and three months. Yzerman said that the team would look at Kristers Gudlevskis, Allen York, and Adam Wilcox as potential backups to Ben Bishop during training camp. However, Yzerman did not rule out the possibility of bringing in a veteran NHL goalie to compete for the backup goalie position.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 17 June 1643, Prince Rupert sortied on a raid out of Oxford to capture the Parliamentarian army's paymaster, but while that failed, did succeed the next morning in {{overwhelming}} two of Essex's small garrison outposts at Postcombe and Chinnor. Hampden rode as a volunteer with 1,100 cavalry and dragoons commanded by Sir Philip Stapleton in pursuit of Rupert, {{with the intention of}} delaying <b>him</b> <b>long</b> enough for a larger force from Essex's main army to cut off his retreat. Rupert halted his own cavalry at Chalgrove to ambush the pursuit and allow 800 less mobile troops to escape via the ford of the River Thame at Chiselhampton. During the ensuing Battle of Chalgrove Field, Hampden was mortally wounded (some sources claim in the shoulder by two carbine balls, others by fragments from his own pistol exploding) which shattered the bone and forced him to leave the field. He reached Thame, and his headquarters at the Greyhound Inn. He survived six days, and died on 24 June.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} to England, he allied himself with the Tories, and {{received}} his reward in being contrasted, much to his advantage, with the Whig victor of Blenheim and Malplaquet. The differences between the three peers, Peterborough, Galway and Tyrawley, who had served in Spain, formed the subject of angry debates in the House of Lords, when the majority declared for Peterborough; after some fiery speeches the resolution that he had performed many great and eminent services was carried, and votes of thanks were passed to him without any division (January and February 1708). His new friends were not desirous of detaining <b>him</b> <b>long</b> on English soil, and they sent him {{on a mission to}} Vienna, where he characteristically engaged the ministry in pledges of which they disapproved. His resentment at this disagreement was softened by the command of a cavalry regiment, and by his appointment as a Knight of the Garter (August 1713). With the accession of George I, Lord Peterborough's influence was gone. Worn out with suffering, he died at Lisbon on 25 October 1735. His remains were brought to England, and buried at Turvey in Bedfordshire on 21 November.|$|E

25|$|For much of {{its history}} Fittipaldi Automotive was entirely {{focussed}} around Emerson Fittipaldi. Emerson was a double world champion renowned for a smooth and quick style {{when he joined the}} family team. Although his older brother drove in the team's first season, the suggestion that Emerson might drive for the team was always in the air and only a year later he cancelled contract discussions with his then team McLaren at a very late stage and signed with Fittipaldi. Although he remained capable of front-running performances, during his time with Fittipaldi Automotive he became an inconsistent performer. On several occasions team manager Jo Ramírez berated his driver after a sudden burst of speed indicated that he had not been driving to his full potential. By 1980 Fittipaldi's team mate Keke Rosberg thought <b>him</b> <b>long</b> past his best, and found him demotivated. Emerson retired {{at the end of that}} year after five full seasons with the family team. Like fellow world champion Jacques Villeneuve’s five-year stint with the BAR team set up for him with BAT money in 1998, the partnership ended the front running Formula One career of a young and highly competitive driver, although he would later build a very successful career in top level American single seater racing in the CART series.|$|E
25|$|The first Battle Royal, on January 22, {{included}} El Terrible, El Hijo del Fantasma, Averno, Dragón Rojo Jr., Euforia, Máscara Dorada, Máximo and Misterioso II. The match {{ended with}} El Terrible and El Hijo del Fantasma {{as the last}} two wrestlers in the ring, which meant their teams would meet in the final first round match that evening. After the match order was determined the actual tournament began. The first match saw Atlantis and Máscara Dorada defeat Dragón Rojo Jr. and La Sombra. While Atlantis is a Rudo the team got along without any problems, Atlantis wore his old Tecnico style white mask and wrestled a more tecnico style to complement Máscara Dorada. The second match saw Máximo and Mr. Niebla form a team that quickly earned the nickname La Peste con Amour ("the Love Plague") born from Mr. Niebla being part of La Peste Negra ("the Black Plague") and Máximo's Exótico ring character. The team won when Máximo kissed Blue Panther or Misterioso II, distracting <b>him</b> <b>long</b> enough for Mr. Niebla to sneak up behind him to roll him up for the pinfall. The third first round match paired longtime rivals Místico, CMLL's top Tecnico up with Averno, one of CMLL's top Rudos together to face Euforia and Averno's regular partner Ephesto. Místico and Averno {{came out with a}} surprising show of unity as they both wore masks that melded their own masks with their partner's mask, the arch-enemies got along in the match, handily winning it. The last match saw El Terrible and Volador Jr. defeat Hijo del Fantasma and Mephisto to earn their way to the quarter finals.|$|E
