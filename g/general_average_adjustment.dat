This article provides general methods to evaluate the long-run <b>average</b> <b>adjustment</b> interval and mean-squared deviation from target corresponding to dead band adjustment schemes under very general assumptions concerning both the process disturbances and the process dynamics. The former are assumed to be nonstationary and to show nonnull deterministic drifts, possibly because of tool-wear. The latter may exhibit delayed effects.

40|$|This {{research}} evaluated {{a methodology}} of cutting logs that involves both their classification {{and the establishment}} of cutting models for different diametrical classes. The software MaxiTora was employed aiming the optimization of cutting logs. A total of 80 logs of Pinus sp had been selected with diameter that varied from 24 cm to 33 cm, gathering four diametrical classes with 20 logs each. In each diametrical class, the logs had been separate in two lots with 10 units, where the first lot was submitted to conventional cutting and the second lot was submitted to the programmed cutting. For each log the effective time of cut was recorded until the last lumber piece was edged. For the conventional cutting system, the efficiency reached from the same cutting system varied from 9. 71 to 11. 22 m 3 /operator. day and the <b>general</b> <b>average</b> corresponded to 10. 18 m 3 /operator/day. In the programmed cutting system, the efficiency reached through the same cutting system varied from 7. 78 to 8. 99 m 3 /operator. day, while the <b>general</b> <b>average</b> corresponded the 8. 07 m 3 /operator. day.

The estimated distribution of adjustment costs is nondegenerate, and the <b>average</b> <b>adjustment</b> cost paid by firms is large in comparison to other results in the literature. Prices...|$|R
