Where such peril exists, no first magistrate is admissible whom the Parliament can not, by a single vote, reduce to a private station. In a state of things holding out any encouragement to that most audacious and profligate of all breaches of trust, even this entireness of constitutional dependence is but a weak protection.|$|E
30|$|Internal hernia {{represented}} by paraduodenal hernia, pericecal hernia, and others {{is a rare}} cause of intestinal obstruction and is estimated as responsible for only 0.5 – 0.9 % of intestinal obstruction in patients with no history of abdominal surgery [9, 10]. Among internal hernia cases, SMH, herniation involving the sigmoid mesocolon, is a rare subset and is estimated at approximately 6 % of all internal hernia cases [11]. Benson and Killen classified SMHs into three types: intersigmoid hernia (ISH), transmesosigmoid hernia (TMSH), and IMSH [8]. ISH {{has been defined as}} herniation into the peritoneum fossa due to <b>insufficient</b> <b>attachment</b> of the left lobe of the mesosigmoid to the parietal peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall, and TMSH and IMSH are herniation into abnormal (mostly congenital) oval-shaped defects of one side or both lobes of the mesocolon. IMSH is described as the rarest type of SMH (ISH 30 / 34, TMSH 3 / 34, IMSH 1 / 34, respectively) [8].|$|E
40|$|Age-related {{changes in}} the niche have long been {{postulated}} to impair the function of somatic stem cells. Here we demonstrate that the aged stem cell niche in skeletal muscle contains substantially reduced levels of fibronectin (FN), leading to detrimental consequences for the function and maintenance of muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Deletion of the gene encoding FN from young regenerating muscles replicates the aging phenotype and leads {{to a loss of}} MuSC numbers. By using an extracellular matrix (ECM) library screen and pathway profiling, we characterize FN as a preferred adhesion substrate for MuSCs and demonstrate that integrin-mediated signaling through focal adhesion kinase and the p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is strongly de-regulated in MuSCs from aged mice because of <b>insufficient</b> <b>attachment</b> to the niche. Reconstitution of FN levels in the aged niche remobilizes stem cells and restores youth-like muscle regeneration. Taken together, we identify the loss of stem cell adhesion to FN in the niche ECM as a previously unknown aging mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The spindle {{assembly}} checkpoint (SAC) inhibits anaphase progression {{in the presence}} of <b>insufficient</b> kinetochore-microtubule <b>attachments,</b> but cells can eventually override mitotic arrest by a process known as mitotic slippage or adaptation. This is a problem for cancer chemotherapy using microtubule poisons. Results Here we describe mitotic slippage in yeast bub 2 Δ mutant cells that are defective in the repression of precocious telophase onset (mitotic exit). Precocious activation of anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) -Cdh 1 caused mitotic slippage {{in the presence of}} nocodazole, while the SAC was still active. APC/C-Cdh 1, but not APC/C-Cdc 20, triggered anaphase progression (securin degradation, separase-mediated cohesin cleavage, sister-chromatid separation and chromosome missegregation), in addition to telophase onset (mitotic exit), during mitotic slippage. This demonstrates that an inhibitory system not only of APC/C-Cdc 20 but also of APC/C-Cdh 1 is critical for accurate chromosome segregation in the presence of <b>insufficient</b> kinetochore-microtubule <b>attachments.</b> Conclusions The sequential activation of APC/C-Cdc 20 to APC/C-Cdh 1 during mitosis is central to accurate mitosis. Precocious activation of APC/C-Cdh 1 in metaphase (pre-anaphase) causes mitotic slippage in SAC-activated cells. For the prevention of mitotic slippage, concomitant inhibition of APC/C-Cdh 1 may be effective for tumor therapy with mitotic spindle poisons in humans. </p...|$|R
40|$|One {{experiment}} {{provided evidence}} in support of Gibson, Pearlmutter, Canseco-Gonzalez, and Hickok's (1996) claim that a recency preference applies to Spanish relative clause attachments, contrary to the claim made by Cuetos and Mitchell (1988). Spanish speakers read stimuli involving either two or three potential attachment sites in which the same lexical content of the two-site conditions appeared in a different structural configuration in the three-site conditions. High attachment was easier than low attachment when only two sites were present, but low attachment was preferred over high attachment, which was in turn preferred over middle attachment, when three sites were present. The experiment replicated earlier results and showed (1) that attachment preferences are determined in part by a preference to attach recently/low, and (2) that lexical biases are <b>insufficient</b> to explain <b>attachment</b> preferences...|$|R
40|$|The COOH {{terminus}} {{of decay}} accelerating factor (DAF) contains {{a signal that}} directs attachment of a glycophospholipid (GPI) membrane anchor. To define this signal we deleted portions of the DAF COOH terminus and expressed the mutant cDNAs it CV 1 origin-deficient SV- 40 cells. Our {{results show that the}} COOH-terminal hydrophobic domain (17 residues) is absolutely required for GPI anchor attachment. However, when fused to the COOH terminus of a secreted protein this hydrophobic domain is <b>insufficient</b> to direct <b>attachment</b> of a GPI anchor. Additional specific information located within the adjacent 20 residues appears to be necessary. We speculate that by analogy with signal sequences for membrane translocation, GPI anchor attachment requires both a COOH- terminal hydrophobic domain (the GPI signal) as well as a suitable cleavage/attachment site located NH 2 terminal to the signal...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDNA {{methylation}} of {{the genome}} is essential for mammalian development and plays crucial roles {{in a variety of}} biological processes including genomic imprinting. Although the DNA methyltransferase 3 -like (Dnmt 3 L) protein lacks DNA methylase activity, it is thought to establish the maternal imprint in combination with the functional DNA methyltransferases. Oogenesis apparently proceeds normally in female mice homozygous for a targeted deletion of Dnmt 3 L, but their heterozygous offspring (Dnmt 3 Lmat−/−) die before midgestation due to an imprinting defect. In this study, we show that Dnmt 3 L is required for the establishment of maternal methylation imprints both in the embryos and the placentae and that the placentae of these embryos develop abnormally. There is a defect {{in the formation of the}} labyrinth, reduced formation of the spongiotrophoblast layer, excess trophoblast giant cells and <b>insufficient</b> <b>attachment</b> between the chorion layer and the ectoplacental cone. In addition, we demonstrate arrest of proliferation of the extraembryonic tissue without apoptosis in vivo and a disturbance of the cell fate of Dnmt 3 Lmat−/− trophoblastic stem cells in vitro. Furthermore, we report that DNA methylation during oogenesis is essential for the establishment of imprinting Mash 2. These findings provide evidence that not only is DNA methylation required for the appropriate maternal imprint in the placenta but that the appropriate imprint is absolutely required for vertebrate placentation...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{handheld}} adapter equipped with a tri-axial accelerometer is the most convenient and efficient approach for measuring vibration exposure at the hand-tool interface, especially when the adapter is incorporated into a miniature handheld or wrist-strapped dosimeter. To help optimize the adapter approach, the specific aims {{of this study are}} to identify and understand the major sources and mechanisms of measurement errors and uncertainties associated with using these adapters, and to explore their improvements. Five representative adapter models were selected and used in the experiment. Five human subjects served as operators in the experiment on a hand-arm vibration test system. The results of this study confirm that many of the handheld adapters can produce substantial overestimations of vibration exposure, and measurement errors can significantly vary with tool, adapter model, mounting position, mounting orientation, and subject. Major problems with this approach include unavoidable influence of the hand dynamic motion on the adapter, unstable attachment, <b>insufficient</b> <b>attachment</b> contact force, and inappropriate adapter structure. However, {{the results of this study}} also suggest that measurement errors can be substantially reduced if the design and use of an adapter can be systematically optimized toward minimizing the combined effects of the identified factors. Some potential methods for improving the design and use of the adapters are also proposed and discussed.

40|$|In {{strong wind}} events like tornado and hurricane, {{significant}} destruction is caused to buildings due to wind-borne debris, {{which are usually}} damaged structural members and components with <b>insufficient</b> <b>attachment.</b> This debris, {{also referred to as}} missiles, can penetrate building walls and roofs and jeopardize human life. Because of this, there are standard impact criteria provided by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA-P- 320, 2014; FEMA-P- 361, 2015) and International Code Council (ICC- 500, 2014) that need to be met when designing safe rooms or storm shelters. The national wind institute at Texas Tech University has done extensive impact testing on different types of structural and non-structural components, which are the basis for current design guidelines. This thesis focuses on investigating previously developed methods for evaluating the perforation of concrete and steel targets and selecting the most relevant formulas that can be applied for the design of tornado safe rooms. For cast-in-place(CIP) concrete, precast concrete and concrete masonry units (CMU), the best method to estimate perforation limit is the Central Research Institute of the Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI) Formula. For Steel target, both the Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL) Formula and the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) give useful estimate for perforation limit. These selected concrete and steel target perforation limit formulas can be used for preliminary design of buildings, to withstand the required impact criteria, giving engineers the flexibility to design structures without depending only on using structural components that have been tested to meet the FEMA criteria. by Selam Mulugeta Gebru.

40|$|ObjectivesStent graft–related complications, {{including}} endoleaks and graft migration, {{are partly}} attributed to <b>insufficient</b> graft <b>attachment</b> to the aortic wall. ONO- 1301, a stable synthetic prostacyclin agonist, reportedly reorganizes extracellular matrices, enhancing tissue healing. We hypothesized that ONO- 1301 –eluting stent grafts may strengthen graft {{attachment to the}} aortic wall. MethodsPolylactic acid polymer-conjugated ONO- 1301, which releases ONO- 1301 into adjacent tissues over 3 months (ONO(+) group), or polylactic acid polymer only (ONO(−) group) was coated onto the stent graft and placed in the descending thoracic aorta of canines weighing 16 to 20 kg under fluoroscopic guidance. Examinations occurred at 1, 2, or 3 months postoperatively (n =  6 for each time point and group). ResultsONO- 1301 aortic-wall concentrations were within the effective range even at 3 months. The maximal load for tearing the graft from the aortic wall ex vivo was significantly greater in the ONO(+) group than in the ONO(−) group (117. 1 % ± 44. 4 %, 133. 9 % ± 23. 2 %, and 119. 9 % ± 13. 5 % at 1, 2, and 3 months, respectively; P = . 0007). Immunohistochemical examination revealed abundant α-smooth muscle actin–positive cells in the neointima in both groups. The fibrotic area between the graft and the aortic wall was significantly larger (P < . 0001), and migrating cells into the graft fabric were significantly greater (P = . 0003) in the ONO(+) group than in the ONO(−) group. ConclusionsIn canines, the ONO- 1301 –eluting stent graft enhanced tissue reorganization and improved the attachment between the graft and the aortic wall. This new device {{may be useful in}} preventing inadequate graft attachment to the aortic wall...|$|R
40|$|In South Africa the {{incidence}} of orphaned and abandoned children is rising dramatically due to HIV/AIDS, poverty and unemployment, thus resulting in an excessive amount of children without appropriate primary care givers. Research has found that institutionalized children or those without significant primary caregivers, often experience problems with attachment formation and other facets of emotional and behavioural development. This qualitative study aimed to explore how caregivers experience and understand the behavioural and emotional development of adolescents {{who are in their}} care. More specifically, the candidate explored whether caregivers perceived any emotional or attachment difficulties in the adolescents, despite their financial and material needs being met. Factors relating to resilience in adolescents were examined {{through the eyes of the}} caregivers, in order to identify and understand ways in which vulnerable children and adolescents rise above adverse circumstances and develop relationships despite having had very little attachment relationships in their past. Erikson’s Developmental Theory and Bolwby’s Attachment Theory underpinned this study together with elements of Freud’s Psychosexual Theory of development. Bandura’s Theory of Self Efficacy and Resilience were included to examine theory relating to resilience in adolescents. During semi-structured interviews with caregivers, open-ended questions were used and thematic content analysis was employed to transcribe, categorize and code data from the interviews. The themes which emerged during data analysis indicated that the caregivers’ perceptions were consistent with the literature and research relating to emotional and behavioural difficulties that adolescents experience as a result of <b>insufficient</b> or inadequate <b>attachment</b> relationships with primary caregivers. The themes highlighted areas of difficulty in the adolescents’ emotional and behavioural development, however, characteristics of resilience and self-efficacy were also identified by the caregivers and considered to be positive elements influencing the adolescents’ growth and development. The researcher interacted only with the caregivers from the identified children’s home. No children or adolescents were approached or involved during the course of the research study...|$|R
40|$|Biofilms {{represent}} an ancient, ubiquitous and influential {{form of life}} on earth. They are interesting both scientifically and because of their impacts on our environment, health and technology. Biofilm formation is initiated by attachment of bacterial cells from an aqueous suspension onto a suitable attachment substratum. While in certain, well studied cases initial attachment and subsequent biofilm formation is mediated by specific ligand-receptor pairs on the bacteria and attachment substratum, in the open environment, including the ocean, it {{is assumed to be}} non-specific and mediated by processes similar to those that drive adsorption of colloids at the water-solid interface. Colloidal principles are studied to determine the molecular and physicochemical interactions involved in the attachment of the model marine bacterium, Cobetia marina to model self-assembled monolayer surfaces. In the simplest application of colloidal principles the wettability of attachment substrata, as measured by the advancing contact angle of water (θAW) on the surface, is frequently used as an approximation for the surface tension. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach for attachment of C. marina and algal zoospores and extend it {{to the development of a}} means to control attachment and release of microorganisms by altering and tuning surface θAW. In many cases, however, θAW does not capture all the information necessary to model attachment of bacteria to attachment substrata; SAMs with similar θAW attach different number of bacteria. More advanced colloidal models of initial bacterial attachment have evolved over the last several decades, with the emergence of the model proposed by van Oss, Chaudhury and Good (VCG) as preeminent. The VCG model enables calculation of interfacial tensions by dividing these into two major interactions thought to be important at biointerfaces: apolar, Lifshitz-van der Waals and polar, Lewis acid-base (including hydrogen bonding) interactions. These interfacial tensions are combined to yield ΔGadh, the free energy associated with attachment of bacteria to a substratum. We use VCG to model ΔGadh and interfacial tensions as they relate to model bacterial attachment on SAMs that accumulate cells to different degrees. Even with the more complex interactions measured by VCG, surface energy of the attachment substratum alone was <b>insufficient</b> to predict <b>attachment.</b> VCG was then employed to model attachment of C. marina to a series of SAMs varying systematically in the number of ethylene glycol residues present in the molecule; an identical series has been previously shown to vary dramatically in the number of cells attached as a function of ethylene glycols present. 	Our results indicate that while VCG adequately models the interfacial tension between water and ethylene glycol SAMs in a manner that predicts bacterial attachment, ΔGadh as calculated by VCG neither qualitatively nor quantitatively reflects the attachment data. The VCG model, thus, fails to capture specific information regarding the interactions between the attaching bacteria, water, and the SAM. We show that while hydrogen-bond accepting interactions are very well captured by this model, the ability for SAMs and bacteria to donate hydrogen bonds is not adequately described as the VCG model is currently applied. We also describe ways in which VCG fails to capture two specific biological aspects that may be important in bacterial attachment to surfaces: 1.) specific interactions between molecules on the surface and bacteria and 2.) bacterial cell surface heterogeneities that may be important in differential attachment to different substrata.
