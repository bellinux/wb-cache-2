5|$|The modern {{family is}} {{commonly}} {{thought to have}} originated in the 1830s: courtship became more open, marriages were often based on affection, and parents devoted more attention to children. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, married couples began to emphasize the importance of sexual attraction and compatibility in their relationships. This led to more intimate and open relationships along with more adolescent freedom. The transition of the family was influenced by the Great Depression, which forced many women <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> in order to compensate for lack of financial stability. In 1932, a federal executive order stated that only one spouse could work for the federal government. This resulted in many women being forced to resign allowing their husbands to continue working.|$|E

2500|$|The {{expression}} of anger {{is believed to}} be related to status, as anger is considered a status emotion. [...] Positive impressions of those who display anger are reserved for people who are stereotypically conferred a higher status. [...] A 2007 study found that male employees who were in a subordinate position in the workplace displayed anger toward higher status employees, while female employees in a subordinate position displayed anger toward higher status employees much less frequently. [...] This suggests that the stereotypical norm of men displaying anger carries over <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace,</b> while the norm of women restraining displays of anger also carries over. [...] It also suggests that, although men in low level positions in the workplace possess a low status in this context, they may carry over the higher status that comes with their gender <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace.</b> [...] Women do not possess this high status; therefore the low status that low level women possess in the workplace is the sole status that matters.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} common reasons {{reported}} for sexually harassing behavior is because the harasser thinks it is funny to do so. In their 2006 study, the AAUW found that this was the most common rationale for harassment by boys—59 percent used it. Less than one-fifth (17%) of those boys who admitted to harassing others say they did so because they wanted a date with the person. (AAUW, 2006) Other researchers assert that the [...] "I thought it was funny" [...] rationale is a fallacy, and the true reasons align more with that of a need to assert power and induce fear in others—more in line with bullying. These hazing behaviors develop in school, continue in high school and college, eventually moving <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace.</b> (Boland, 2002) ...|$|E

Later, in 1968, ratification of the ILO's convention number 100 instituted equality of treatment in employment of men and women for work of equal value.

In 1980, Tunisia's level of demographic growth was among the lowest in the Southern countries and is found to be the lowest of the Arab world.

40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{discussion}} in law reviews and business journals about <b>the</b> so-called new <b>workplace,</b> which is distinguished from the old, in part, by greater employee mobility and job flexibility. This article extends that discussion by exploring the implications of <b>the</b> new <b>workplace</b> for <b>the</b> design of dispute resolution systems. In particular, it argues that the structure and values of <b>the</b> new <b>workplace</b> correspond to <b>the</b> essential values of democratic governance, and that dispute resolution should be integrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> new <b>workplace</b> {{in a way that}} enhances rather than diminishes these core democratic values. As I have articulated in earlier work, these values specifically include personal autonomy, as well as certain political values (participation, accountability, transparency and rationality), legal values (equality and due process), and social capital values (trust in government, social connection and reciprocity). The article further discusses how mediation and arbitration can be integrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> new <b>workplace</b> in ways that enhances their democratic character, as defined by these dimensions. Finally, it draws upon the organizational behavior and related literatures to provide empirical support for the proposition that more democratic programs can facilitate such traditional management objectives as recruitment and retention, enhanced employee performance, and compliance with corporate rules, policies, and goals...|$|R
2500|$|Indigenous {{women began}} {{demanding}} rights beginning in 1990. Because many indigenous {{women had been}} forced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace,</b> their concerns had similarities with urban workers, as were their concerns with violence, lack of political representation, education, family planning choices, and other issues typically addressed by feminists. However, indigenous women also faced an ethnic discrimination and cultural orientation that was different from feminists, and particularly those from urban areas. In some of their cultures, early marriage, as young as 13 or 14 prevailed; in other cultures, derecho de pernada (right of the first night) allowed rape and abuse of women with impunity for their attackers; while in others, organized violence against women {{had been used to}} both [...] "punish" [...] activism and send a message to their men that women's demands would not be tolerated. Similar to other women of color and minorities in other feminist movements indigenous women in Mexico have struggled with ethnocentrism from mainstream feminist groups.|$|E

For these concepts we determine different types of learning material from different sources that answer the current learning need about the concept...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders and associated risk factors among Iranian steel workers. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 1439 questionnaires were provided from 1984 randomly selected workers of four Iranian steel industries. Data of musculoskeletal disorders was gathered by means of standardized Nordic self-reporting questionnaire. Demographic and work related data were collected <b>into</b> <b>the</b> check list. Results: Out of 1984 individuals, 1439 questionnaires returned and mean age of study workers was 37. 23 ± 8. 74 years old. Among workers, 46. 3 % in the past week and 61 % in the last year claimed one of musculoskeletal {{disorders in}} their bodies.
