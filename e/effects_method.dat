40|$|International audienceThe {{screening}} method proposed by Morris in 1991 allows {{to identify the}} important factors of a model, including those involved in interactions. This method, known as the elementary <b>effects</b> <b>method,</b> relies on a “one-factor-at-a-time” (OAT) design of experiments, i. e. two successive points differ only by one factor. In this article, we introduce a non-OAT simplex-based design for the elementary <b>effects</b> <b>method.</b> Its main advantage, compared to Morris's OAT design, is that the sample size doesn't collapse when the design is projected on sub-spaces spanned by groups of factors.

Using quantitative methods we discuss the effects of some variables on school dropout. We considered the following variables: number of pupils per teacher, the share of education expenditures in GDP, unemployment etc. For estimation we used data sets recorded in the 27 EU countries during 2000 - 2009. For processing the data series panel methods are used: the common constant method, the fixed <b>effects</b> <b>method</b> and the random <b>effects</b> <b>method.</b> Among the important causes of school dropout that {{is evidenced by the}} estimated models we can mention the low level of the economic development of some countries in EU, the share of education expenditures in GDP and labor market characteristics at the national level...|$|E

40|$|In the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB), coal seams are {{exploited}} under {{progressively more}} difficult geological and mining conditions (greater depth, higher horizontal stress, more frequent occurrence of competent rock layers, etc.). Mining depth, dislocations and mining remnants in coal seams {{are the most}} important factors responsible for the occurrence of rockburst hazards. Longwall mining next to the mining edges of neighbouring coal seams is particularly disadvantageous. The levels of rockburst hazards are minimised via the use of rockburst prevention methods. One active prevention method is torpedo blasting in roof rocks. Torpedo blastings are performed in order to decrease local stress concentrations in rock masses and to fracture the roof rocks to prevent or minimise the impact of high-energy tremors on excavations. The estimation of the effectiveness of torpedo blasting is particularly important when mining is under difficult geological and mining conditions. Torpedo blasting is the main form of active rockburst prevention in the assigned colliery in the Polish part of the USCB. The effectiveness of blasting can be estimated using the seismic <b>effect</b> <b>method,</b> in which the seismic monitoring data and the mass of explosives are taken into consideration. The seismic <b>effect</b> <b>method</b> was developed in the Czech Republic and is always being used in collieries in the Czech part of the coal basin. Now, this method has been widely adopted for our selected colliery in the Polish part of the coal basin. The effectiveness of torpedo blastings in the faces and galleries of the assigned longwall in coal seam 506 has been estimated. The results show that the effectiveness of torpedo blastings for this longwall was significant in light of the seismic <b>effect</b> <b>method,</b> which corresponds to the in situ observations. The seismic <b>effect</b> <b>method</b> is regularly applied to estimating the blasting effectiveness in the selected colliery...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{effectiveness}} of various atypical antipsychotics {{in the treatment}} of acute mania is reported repeatedly, but those for typical antipsychotics are restricted to haloperidol and chlorpromazine. As there is a comparative importance of side effects for typical and atypical antipsychotics, we decided to compare the therapeutic effect of thiothixene and risperidone as a combination with lithium for the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder. Materials and Methods: In 8 week double-blind clinical trial, 84 patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder were randomized for treatment with lithium plus thiothixene (N= 42) or lithium plus risperidone (N= 42). Manic, positive-negative symptoms, anxiety and depression were measured bi-weekly with Young Mania Rating, positive and negative symptom scale (PANSS) and Hamilton rating scale score. Fasting blood sugar, weight, general side effects and extrapyramidal symptoms were also evaluated. The measures analyzed using SPSS- 17 software. To compare demographic characteristics t-test, χ 2 test and fixed <b>effects</b> <b>method</b> were used. A fixed <b>effects</b> <b>method</b> was applied to omit missing data effects. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} the thiothixene and risperidone groups in Young mania rating scale and other outcome measures during the 8 week trial. There was no significant difference in weight, blood sugar and clinical global impression (CGI) between groups. Conclusion: Thiothixene is as effective as risperidone in the improvement of manic and psychotic symptoms. There was no significant difference with risperidone in developing extrapyramidal symptoms, so it can be used as an appropriate combination with lithium for the treatment of bipolar patients in psychotic manic episode. ...|$|E
