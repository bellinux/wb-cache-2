5|$|Blythe, who is nearsighted, {{took off}} his glasses before {{entering}} the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of the fans, who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, Pořádek rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving. The second time, he tried to {{put his arms around}} Blythe in an attempt to <b>hug</b> <b>him.</b> Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair {{to the edge of the}} stage, where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security.|$|E

500|$|During filming, David Duchovny {{decided to}} act out the reunion scene in a manner {{contrary}} to what the script called for. Manners later noted, [...] "In the script, it called for his sister to run up and <b>hug</b> <b>him,</b> and Mulder was to start crying. David didn't want to cry. I said, 'David, you're finally realizing your sister is, in fact, dead. [...] He said, 'Just watch what I do; trust me.' And, he held that little girl actress—there was a beatific {{smile on his face}} that was absolutely astounding." [...] Manners was very happy with the change and included it in the final cut of the episode. To create the scene featuring the ghosts of the dead children interacting with the characters, various layers of film had to be overlaid onto each other. Many passes of the shot were taken, which took hours to complete. After the shots had been secured, the film of the ghosts had to be made transparent. The scenes wherein Mulder is interacting with the walk-ins was actually shot in daylight. However, specialized [...] "day for night" [...] photography was used to make the finished scene look {{as if it had been}} filmed at night. To achieve this, the subjects were illuminated with bright lights and the sky was completely avoided. The entire scene was shot at 48 frames a second, twice that of normal speed. Rebecca Toolan was flown down from Vancouver specifically for this episode, and [...] "Sein Und Zeit". To create her ghostly apparition, the production staff had to shoot multiple frames, which were then spliced into footage of Duchovny. Manners played the part of the hypnotist in the video which Scully watches of Mulder under hypnosis. Manners later noted that [...] "I only act when you can't actually see my face". Manners was critical of Duchovny's wig—which had been added to make the footage seem older. He sardonically noted that [...] "this is [...] one of the episodes that Cheri Medcalf [...] won an Emmy for." ...|$|E
