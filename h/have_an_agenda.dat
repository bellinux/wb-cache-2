25|$|During {{his time}} with CAIR, Bedier spoke out for Muslim rights {{not only in the}} United States, but also on a {{worldwide}} scale. This has sparked some criticism, backlash and threats. His critics say that Bedier does not speak out harshly enough against Palestinian groups and claim that his support of a Palestinian state that coexists with Israel proves that he’s sympathetic with extremists who <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>agenda</b> against Israel, a claim Bedier denies.|$|E
25|$|The SBOE sets {{curriculum}} {{standards for}} Texas {{public schools and}} exerts considerable influence over the selection and content of Texas school textbooks used by over five million K-12 students. Because {{of the size of}} Texas' textbook market, learning materials developed for Texas are often used in other states as well. The SBOE has faced school textbook controversy in the past when former board members tried to inject ideologically-driven information into science, history, and social studies textbooks that they believed was vital to be taught in Texas schools. With Bruner on the SBOE, citizens fear the far-right conservative would <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>agenda</b> to mount a similar attack on facts.|$|E
25|$|We {{know that}} our {{consciousness}} inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena. Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. We usually {{are not aware of}} the breathing of our lungs or the beating of our heart unless somehow our attention is called to them. Our ability to control either is limited. Our kidneys command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose. Few of us have any idea what our liver is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs. These organs <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>agenda</b> the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.|$|E

500|$|After leaving Scientology, Beghe {{contacted}} Andreas Heldal-Lund, {{founder of}} Operation Clambake, who {{convinced him to}} meet with journalist and Scientology critic Mark Bunker. Heldal-Lund and Bunker went to Beghe's house, where Beghe participated in an interview about his experiences as a Scientologist. Bunker published a three-minute portion of the three-hour interview to YouTube in mid-April 2008, and in the video Beghe calls Scientology [...] "very dangerous for your spiritual, psychological, mental, emotional health and evolution." [...] The interview closes with Beghe stating, [...] "I don't <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>agenda.</b> I'm just trying to help. [...] I {{have the luxury of}} having gotten into Scientology and after having been in it, been out. And that's a perspective that people who are still in and not out do not have." ...|$|E

On 18 June 2010 Thirsty Merc released their third album, Mousetrap Heart, which was recorded mostly in Los Angeles with Matt Wallace co-producing, while two tracks were produced in Melbourne with Gravina. Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald opined that [...] "we buy, or actively avoid, songs that excite a response in us but radio wants songs that fit in, that don't provoke strong responses, that offend the fewest people ... this [...] is a collection of extremely professional, well-considered, carefully targeted songs whose key performance indicators are ticked off one by one in a manner so efficient you suspect band meetings must <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>agenda,</b> notes secretary and double-cream biscuits for elevenses".|$|E

[...] "She {{kept coming back to}} it time and time again, obviously trying to trap Governor Palin into saying something stupid or extreme. Everything after that has to be seen in the context of that episode, because Governor Palin never trusted Katie Couric after that.

2500|$|When Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{began to}} lose ground in the polls, Chrétien was the major beneficiary. In {{preparation}} for the 1993 election, Chrétien {{won the right to}} have the final say over riding nominations and to veto any candidate that displeased him. Chrétien's use of this power caused some protests within the Liberal Party with John Nunziata publicly complaining that [...] "The backroom guys have taken control of the party. I guess they think they can muzzle us all". Chrétien told one prospective Liberal candidate Hec Clouthier, who informed Chrétien that was probably going to win the nomination to be the Liberal candidate for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, defeating the incumbent Len Hopkins that: [...] "Well, you might [...] But you're {{not going to get the}} chance...I am the boss. I have the right to make this decision. I <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>agenda</b> for this country. I want to be prime minister and do great things, and I've got to put people in place who I can know can win". Chrétien added that he knew Hopkins could win because he won his seat eight times in a row while Clouthier had no equivalent record. When Clouthier refused to withdraw his candidacy as ordered and looked certain to win the Liberal nomination for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, he was expelled from the Liberal Party. Chrétien was so confident that he was going to win the 1993 election that he formed his transition team in October 1992 to prepare for the hand-over of power 13 months before it actually happened.|$|E
