It also supports Apple Loops– royalty-free professionally recorded <b>instrument</b> <b>loops.</b> Logic Pro and Express share many functions {{and the same}} interface. Logic Express is limited to two-channel stereo mixdown, while Logic Pro can handle multichannel surround sound. Both can handle up to 255 audio tracks, depending on system performance (CPU and hard disk throughput and seek time). Logic Pro can work with MIDI keyboards and control surfaces for input and processing, and for MIDI output. It features real-time scoring in musical notation, supporting guitar tablature, chord abbreviations and drum notation.|$|R
50|$|Multitrack mode {{is where}} the royalty-free <b>instrument</b> <b>loops</b> and sound effects can be {{arranged}} in synchronisation with the video track, and where narration or other external audio sources can be recorded. There are both single and multi-take recording features. As with all of Apple's loop arranging software, the project's master key and tempo can be set, {{and all of the}} loops will automatically be played at those settings, regardless of the key and tempo at which they were originally recorded. At the same time, the key and tempo for the whole project can be varied over time with the master envelopes.|$|R

40|$|Automated {{online search}} is a {{powerful}} technique for performance diagnosis. Such a search can change the types of experiments it performs while the program is running, making decisions based on live performance data. Previous research has addressed search speed and scaling searches to large codes and many nodes. This paper explores using a finer granularity for the bottlenecks that we locate in an automated online search, i. e., refining the search to bottlenecks localized to loops. The ability to insert and remove instrumentation on-the-fly means an online search can utilize fine-grain program structure {{in ways that are}} infeasible using other performance diagnosis techniques. We automatically detect loops in a program�s binary control flow graph and use this information to efficiently <b>instrument</b> <b>loops.</b> We implemented our new strategy in an existing automated online performance tool, Paradyn. Results for several sequential and parallel applications show that a loop-aware search strategy can increase bottleneck precision without compromising search time or cost...|$|R

40|$|Recently, various {{dimensionality}} reduction {{approaches have}} been proposed as alternatives to PCA or LDA. These im-proved approaches do not rely on a linearity assumption, and are hence capable of discovering more complex embeddings within {{different regions of the}} data sets. Despite their success on artificial datasets, it is not straightforward to predict which technique is the most appropriate for a given real dataset. In this paper, we empirically evaluate recent techniques on two real audio use cases: musical <b>instrument</b> <b>loops</b> used in music production and sound effects used in sound editing. ISOMAP and t-SNE are being compared to PCA in a visualization prob-lem, where we end up with a two-dimensional view. Various evaluation measures are used: classification performance, as well as trustworthiness/continuity assessing the preservation of neighborhoods. Although PCA and ISOMAP can yield good continuity performance even locally (samples in the original space remain close-by in the low-dimensional one), they fail to preserve the structure of the data well enough to ensure that distinct subgroups remain separate in the visual-ization. We show that t-SNE presents the best performance, and can even be beneficial as a pre-processing stage for im-proving classification when the amount of labeled data is low.

5000|$|Recent {{recordings}} of Byrds work {{written in the}} early 1960s, performed by the American Contemporary Music Ensemble (including pianist Timothy Andres, violinists Caroline Shaw and Caleb Burhans, and violist Nadia Sirota) were released by New World Records in 2004. They include Animals (written for prepared piano and other <b>instruments),</b> <b>Loops</b> & Sequences (written for Charlotte Moorman to perform on cello), Four Sound*Poems (verses written by Byrd and dedicated to four experimental women artists), Water Music (commissioned by and dedicated to percussionist Max Neuhaus), and Prelude to The Mystery Cheese-Ball, a piece originally performed by Byrd in 1961 with Young, Mac Low, Ono, David Tudor, and Diane Wakoski. The liner notes by Eric Smigel state:Crafted with technical precision, all of the works were designed to explore the [...] "singularity of sound" [...] that was central to Byrds lessons with Feldman. Byrd remains sensitive to the vertical qualities of any given pitch collection, but rather than presenting static drones or sequences of isolated chords, he frequently animates the relationship among the materials through indeterminate procedures and shifting cycles.... In other words, he mobilizes the rhythmic arrangements of the independent components, which creates a sophisticated brand of variable polyphony, similar to the ever-changing spatial arrangements of a Calder mobile.|$|R
