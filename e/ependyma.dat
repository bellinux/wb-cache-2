5|$|CSF {{returns to}} the {{vascular}} system by entering the dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations. These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses. CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate. CSF turns over {{at a rate of}} three to four times a day. CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the <b>ependyma.</b>|$|E
25|$|The subcommissural cells, {{specialized}} in the secretion of glycoproteins (including ependymin) are arranged into two polarized layers: <b>ependyma</b> and hypendyma. The first one (formed {{by a very}} high cylindrical cells) release their secretions into the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid and the hypendyma cells (located under the <b>ependyma),</b> characterized by numerous blood capillaries and glial cells, projects into the local blood vessels and to the subarachnoidal space.|$|E
25|$|Some studies {{indicate}} the presence of both tyrosine-hydroxylase-immunoreactive nerve fibers and dopamine receptors in the SCO <b>ependyma.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ependymomas are tumors {{arising from}} the <b>ependyma,</b> an epithelium-like tissue of the central nervous system. In {{patients}} with NF2 and ependymomas, the tumor suppressant function of Merlin may be compromised. Loss of function mutations occurring in chromosome 22q, where Merlin proteins are coded, can promote tumorigenesis, or {{the creation of new}} tumorous cells. Deletions, too, in the NH2-terminal domain of merlin proteins have been associated with early tumor onset and poor prognosis in affected patients.|$|E
25|$|The {{ventricular}} {{system is}} a set of four interconnected cavities (ventricles) in the brain, where the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced. Within each ventricle is a region of choroid plexus, a network of ependymal cells involved in the production of CSF. The ventricular system is continuous with the central canal of the spinal cord (from the fourth ventricle) allowing for the flow of CSF to circulate. All of the ventricular system and the central canal of the spinal cord are lined with <b>ependyma,</b> a specialised form of epithelium.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ependyma</b> is {{the thin}} {{epithelial}} {{lining of the}} ventricular system {{of the brain and}} the central canal of the spinal cord, made up of ependymal cells. <b>Ependyma</b> is one of the four types of neuroglia in the central nervous system (CNS). It is involved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and is shown to serve as a reservoir for neuroregeneration.|$|E

5000|$|The tela choroidea (or tela chorioidea) is {{a region}} of meningeal pia mater and {{underlying}} <b>ependyma</b> that {{gives rise to the}} choroid plexus in each of the brain’s four ventricles. The tela choroidea is a very thin part of the loose connective tissue of pia mater that overlies and closely adheres to the <b>ependyma</b> with no intervening tissue. It has a rich blood supply. The <b>ependyma</b> and [...] vascular pia mater that make up the tela choroidea form regions of minute projections known as a choroid plexus that projects into each ventricle. The choroid plexus produces the cerebrospinal fluid of the ventricular system. The tela choroidea in the ventricles forms from different parts of the roof plate in the [...] development of the embryo.|$|E
50|$|Transtillaspis <b>ependyma</b> is {{a species}} of moth of the Tortricidae family. It is found in Ecuador (Loja Province) and Peru.|$|E
50|$|The {{species name}} {{refers to the}} {{colouration}} of the forewings covering the pale hindwings and is derived from Greek <b>ependyma</b> (meaning overcoat).|$|E
50|$|On section it is {{seen that}} the funiculus separans is formed by a strip of {{thickened}} <b>ependyma,</b> and the area postrema by loose, highly vascular, neuroglial tissue containing nerve cells of moderate size.|$|E
50|$|It {{is covered}} by {{a thin layer of}} grey matter {{continuous}} with that of the spinal cord; superficial to this is a thin lamina of neuroglia which constitutes the <b>ependyma</b> of the ventricle and supports a layer of ciliated epithelium.|$|E
5000|$|Schizencephaly (...) {{is a rare}} {{birth defect}} {{characterized}} by abnormal clefts lined with grey matter that form the <b>ependyma</b> of the cerebral ventricles to the pia mater. These clefts can occur bilaterally or unilaterally. Common clinical features of this malformation include epilepsy, motor deficits, and psychomotor retardation.|$|E
50|$|Ependymoma is a tumor {{that arises}} from the <b>ependyma,</b> a tissue of the central nervous system. Usually, in {{pediatric}} cases the location is intracranial, while in adults it is spinal. The common location of intracranial ependymoma is the fourth ventricle. Rarely, ependymoma can occur in the pelvic cavity.|$|E
50|$|The third {{ventricle}} is {{bounded by}} the thalamus and hypothalamus {{on both the}} left and right sides. The lamina terminalis forms the anterior wall. The floor is formed by hypothalamic structures. The roof is formed by the <b>ependyma,</b> lining the undersurface of the tela choroidea of the third ventricle.|$|E
50|$|The subependymal zone is a {{cell layer}} below the <b>ependyma</b> in the lateral ventricles of the brain. This region {{contains}} adult neural stem cells {{which have the}} potential to generate new neurons and glial cells via neurogenesis. It is an adult version of the embryonic forebrain germinal zone.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ependyma</b> {{is made up}} of ependymal cells called ependymocytes, a type of glial cell. These cells {{line the}} CSF-filled ventricles in the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. These are nervous tissue cells with a ciliated simple {{columnar}} form much like that of some mucosal epithelial cells.|$|E
5000|$|In 1851 he {{described}} a posterior {{extension of the}} cavum septi pellucidi, an anomaly that is found in {{a small percentage of}} human brains. It was later named the [...] "cavum Vergae" [...] (Verga's ventricle), or the [...] "sixth ventricle". This name is considered a misnomer because Verga's ventricle doesn't contain cerebrospinal fluid nor is it lined by <b>ependyma.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{overlying}} skin or squamous mucosa {{is intact}} and uninvolved by the process. There is normal glial tissue set within a {{fibrous connective tissue}} stroma. There is such blending, that the underlying process {{may be difficult to}} detect without special studies. In a few cases, large gemistocytes, neurons, choroid plexus, <b>ependyma,</b> and retinal pigmented cells may be seen.|$|E
5000|$|A {{function}} of the pia mater {{is that of the}} blood-brain barrier (BBB), which keeps the CSF and brain fluid separate from the blood, allowing limited sodium, chlorine, and potassium through, and absolutely no plasma proteins nor organic molecules. Nearby, the ventricles are lined with the <b>ependyma</b> membrane. The CSF is only kept separate through the pia mater. Due to the <b>ependyma</b> and pia mater’s high permeability, nearly anything entering the CSF is able to enter the brain interstitial fluid. [...] However, regulation of this permeability is achieved through the abundant amount of astrocyte foot processes which are responsible for connecting the capillaries and the pia mater in a way that helps limit the amount of free diffusion going into the CNS. The permeability of the pia then serves to closely connect the interstitial brain fluid and the CSF and allow them to remain nearly homogenous in terms of composition.|$|E
50|$|The body of {{the lateral}} {{ventricle}} is the central portion, just posterior to the frontal horn. The trigone of the lateral ventricle is a triangular area defined by the temporal horn inferiorly, the occipital horn posteriorly, and the {{body of the}} lateral ventricle anteriorly. The cella media is {{the central part of the}} lateral ventricle. <b>Ependyma</b> cover the inside of the lateral ventricles and are epithelial cells.|$|E
50|$|Tanycytes {{in adult}} mammals {{are found in}} the {{ventricular}} system and the circumventricular organs. They are most numerous in the third ventricle of the brain, but can also be seen in the spinal cord radiating from the <b>ependyma</b> of the central canal to the spinal cord surface. Tanycytes represent approximately 0.6% {{of the population of the}} lateral ventricular wall, as described by Doetsch et al.|$|E
50|$|NAWM in MS {{has been}} {{reported}} to be similar to NAWM in leukoaraiosis, though NAWM damage in MS is inflammatory and special microscopic techniques like CARS microscopy show that the CNS of MS patients may be globally altered, and both lesions and NAWM are just manifestations of another underlying problem. The NAWM is specially abnormal close to the ventricles, which may indicate a pathogenic mechanism mediated via the CSF or <b>ependyma.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mark S. Niziak, Jr. ("Marcus") {{was born}} on August 29, 1985. Two years later, he was {{diagnosed}} with an ependymoma, a tumor that arises from the <b>ependyma.</b> Following his diagnosis, Marcus had his first surgery in June 1987. After which, he started his first round of chemotherapy. From September to December, he underwent a round of radiation. Finally, in the year 1988 it seemed as though the tumor had gone away.|$|E
50|$|Periventricular means {{beside the}} ventricle, while subependymal (also spelled subepydymal) means beneath the ependyma; because the <b>ependyma</b> is the thin {{epithelial}} sheet lining the ventricles of the brain, these two terms {{are used to}} define heterotopia occurring directly next to a ventricle. This {{is by far the}} most common location for heterotopia. Patients with isolated subependymal heterotopia usually present with a seizure disorder in the second decade of life.|$|E
50|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of syringomyelia is debated.The {{cerebrospinal fluid}} also serves to cushion the brain. Excess cerebrospinal fluid {{in the central}} canal of the spinal cord is called hydromyelia. This term refers to increased cerebrospinal fluid that is contained within the <b>ependyma</b> of the central canal. When fluid dissects into the surrounding white matter forming a cystic cavity or syrinx, the term syringomyelia is applied. As these conditions coexist {{in the majority of}} cases, the term syringohydromyelia is applied. The terms are used interchangeably.|$|E
50|$|The tela choroidea of {{the fourth}} {{ventricle}} is a double layer of pia mater and <b>ependyma,</b> between the cerebellum and {{the lower part of}} the roof {{of the fourth}} ventricle. The two layers are continuous with each other in front, and are mostly adherent throughout. The anterior layer of the fold, contains vascular fringes which make up the choroid plexus. The anterior layer is continuous inferiorly with the pia mater on the inferior cerebellar peduncles and the closed part of the medulla oblongata.|$|E
50|$|The area postrema {{is a small}} {{protuberance}} {{found at}} the inferoposterior limit of the fourth ventricle. Specialized ependymal cells are found within the area postrema. These specialized ependymal cells differ slightly from the majority of ependymal cells (ependymocytes), forming a unicellular epithelium lining of the ventricles and central canal. The area postrema is separated from the vagal triangle by the funiculus separans, a thin semitransparent ridge. The vagal triangle overlies the dorsal vagal nucleus and is situated on the caudal end of the rhomboid fossa or 'floor' of the fourth ventricle. The area postrema is situated just before the obex, the inferior apex of the caudal ventricular floor. Both the funiculus separans and area postrema have a similar thick ependyma-containing tanycyte covering. <b>Ependyma</b> and tanycytes can participate in transport of neurochemicals {{into and out of}} the cerebrospinal fluid from its cells or adjacent neurons, glia or vessels. <b>Ependyma</b> and tanycytes may also participate in chemoreception. The eminence of the area postrema is considered a circumventricular organ because its endothelial cells do not contain tight junctions, which allows for free exchange of molecules between blood and brain tissue. This unique breakdown in the blood-brain barrier is partially compensated for by the presence of a tanycyte barrier.|$|E
50|$|Aquaporin-4, {{also known}} as AQP4, is a water channel protein encoded by the AQP4 gene in humans. AQP4 belongs to the aquaporin family of {{integral}} membrane proteins that conduct water through the cell membrane. A limited number of aquaporins are found within {{the central nervous system}} (CNS): AQP1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 11, but more exclusive representation of AQP1, 4, and 9 are found in the brain and spinal cord. In the CNS, AQP4 is the most prevalent aquaporin channel, specifically located at the perimicrovessel astrocyte foot processes, glia limitans, and <b>ependyma.</b>|$|E
50|$|In schizencephaly, the neurons border {{the edge}} of the cleft, {{implying}} a very early disruption of the usual grey matter migration during embryogenesis. The cause of the disruption is not known, but likely the cause may be either genetic or a physical insult, such as infection, infarction, hemorrhage, in utero stroke, exposure to a toxin, or mutation. It is thought that normal neuron migration during the second trimester of intrauterine development, when primitive neuron precursors (germinal matrix) migrate from just beneath the ventricular <b>ependyma</b> to the peripheral hemispheres where they form the cortical grey matter.|$|E
50|$|In {{the lateral}} ventricles the tela choroidea-a {{double-layered}} fold of pia mater and <b>ependyma,</b> produces the choroid fissure (also {{known as the}} choroidal fissure). The choroid fissure is C-shaped, runs between the fornix and the thalamus {{in the body of}} the ventricle, and between the stria terminalis and hippocampal fimbria in the inferior horn, and is the location of the attachment of the margins of the choroid plexus. In the choroid fissure of the lateral ventricles, the tela choroidea is a lateral extension of the tela choroidea from the third ventricle.|$|E

50|$|The {{section of}} the pia mater {{enveloping}} the brain {{is known as the}} cranial pia mater. It is anchored to the brain by the processes of astrocytes, which are glial cells responsible for many functions, including maintenance of the extracellular space. The cranial pia mater joins with the <b>ependyma,</b> which lines the cerebral ventricles to form choroid plexuses that produce cerebrospinal fluid. Together with the other meningeal layers, the function of the pia mater is to protect the central nervous system by containing the cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions the brain and spine.|$|E

5000|$|The choroid plexus {{consists}} of a layer of cuboidal epithelial cells surrounding a core of capillaries and loose connective tissue. The epithelium of the choroid plexus is continuous with the ependymal cell layer that lines the ventricles, but unlike the <b>ependyma,</b> the epithelial layer has tight junctions between the cells on the side facing the ventricle (apical surface). These tight junctions prevent the majority of substances from crossing the cell layer into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); thus the choroid plexus acts as a blood-CSF barrier. The choroid plexus folds into many villi around each capillary, creating frond-like processes that project into the ventricles. The villi, along with a brush border of microvilli, greatly increases the surface area of the choroid plexus. CSF is formed as plasma is filtered from the blood through the epithelial cells. Choroid plexus epithelial cells actively transport sodium ions into the ventricles and water follows the resulting osmotic gradient.|$|E
