In 2000 the first project, the New Forests of Aarhus, was completed which aimed to double the forest cover in the municipality and in 2009 another phase was announced to double forest cover once more before the year 2030. The afforestation plans were realised as a local project in collaboration with private landowners, under a larger national agenda. Other projects to expand natural habitats include a rewilding effort in Geding-Kasted Bog and continuous monitoring of the four Natura 2000 areas in the municipality.|$|E

When disposed of in landfill, food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable <b>groundwater</b> <b>pollution.</b> The food supply chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping food waste that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E

A {{study of the}} groundwater quality of the principal aquifers of the United States conducted between 1991 and 2004, showed that 23% of domestic wells had contaminants at levels greater than human-health benchmarks. Another study suggested that the major <b>groundwater</b> <b>pollution</b> problems in Africa, considering the order of importance are: (1) nitrate pollution, (2) pathogenic agents, (3) organic pollution, (4) salinization, and (5) acid mine drainage.|$|E

These benefits include use values such as avoiding health risks, reducing higher water costs due to treatment cost or other water purchases as well as non-use or passive values. Thus, when a person pays a WTP to purchase groundwater quality by protecting <b>groundwater</b> from <b>pollution,</b> he or she is purchasing a set of environmental services.|$|R

The contaminant migration is investigated on long and short term time scales and compared to predictions without carrier facilitation. The simulations demonstrate the importance of carrier facilitation and suggest strongly to take this aspect into account.

Polluted groundwater is mapped by sampling soils and groundwater near suspected or known sources of pollution, {{to determine the extent}} of the pollution, and to aid in the design of groundwater remediation systems. Preventing <b>groundwater</b> <b>pollution</b> near potential sources such as landfills requires lining the bottom of a landfill with watertight materials, collecting any leachate with drains, and keeping rainwater off any potential contaminants, along with regular monitoring of nearby groundwater to verify that contaminants have not leaked into the groundwater.|$|E
