As long ago as 3000 BC in Egypt, cats were used to control pests of grain stores such as rodents. Ferrets were domesticated by 500 AD in Europe for use as mousers. Mongooses were {{introduced}} into homes to control rodents and snakes, probably by the ancient Egyptians.|$|E

5|$|Most fish possess highly {{developed}} sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color vision that <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> {{good as a}} human's (see vision in fishes). Many fish also have chemoreceptors {{that are responsible for}} extraordinary senses of taste and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the Ampullae of Lorenzini, organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt. Other fish, like the South American electric fishes Gymnotiformes, can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication.|$|E

Near {{the end of that}} same century, Charles Bernstein declared that poetry should <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> interesting as TV. The start of a new century brings with it a new demand for poetry: poetry must <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> witty, as knowing and as surprising as Created in Darkness by Troubled Americans. And, though it may not seem so at first, this silly—and disturbing, and wonderful—book offers serious lessons for and challenges to contemporary American poetry at all levels: from individual poem to overarching theory.

5|$|Several {{branches}} of creationism, including creation science, neo-creationism, and intelligent design, {{argue that the}} idea of life being directly designed by a god or intelligence <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> scientific as evolutionary theory, and should therefore be taught in public education. Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's evidence, methodology, plausibility, morality, and scientific acceptance. The scientific community does not recognize such objections as valid, pointing to detractors' misinterpretations of such things as the scientific method, evidence, and basic physical laws.|$|E

25|$|The halting {{problem is}} an {{analogous}} example {{from the field}} of centralised computation: we are given a computer program and the task is to decide whether it halts or runs forever.

Clearly, the network's worst case route length <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> large as its diameter, so DHTs are limited by the degree/diameter tradeoff that is fundamental in graph theory. Route length can be greater than diameter, since the greedy routing algorithm may not find shortest paths.|$|E

An unbiased estimator which achieves this lower bound {{is said to be}} (fully) efficient. Such a solution achieves the lowest possible mean squared error among all unbiased methods, and is therefore the minimum variance unbiased (MVU) estimator. However, in some cases, no unbiased technique exists which achieves the bound. This may occur even when an MVU estimator exists.|$|E
