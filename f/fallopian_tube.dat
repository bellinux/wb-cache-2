5|$|After being {{released}} from the ovary, the egg is swept into the <b>fallopian</b> <b>tube</b> by the fimbria, which is a fringe of tissue {{at the end of}} each <b>fallopian</b> <b>tube.</b> After about a day, an unfertilized egg will disintegrate or dissolve in the <b>fallopian</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
5|$|Official Church {{teaching}} {{allows for}} medical procedures and treatments {{intended to protect}} or restore the mother's health if {{she would be in}} mortal danger without them, even when such procedures carry some risk of death to the fetus. Examples include the removal of a <b>fallopian</b> <b>tube</b> {{in the case of an}} ectopic pregnancy, removal of a pregnant cancerous uterus, or an appendectomy.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to breast cancer}} in men and women, mutations in BRCA2 also lead to {{an increased risk of}} ovarian, <b>Fallopian</b> <b>tube,</b> prostate, and pancreatic cancers, as well as malignant melanoma. In some studies, mutations in {{the central part of the}} gene have been associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer and a lower risk of prostate cancer than mutations in other parts of the gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with BRCA2 mutations.|$|E

5000|$|Pig <b>fallopian</b> <b>tubes</b> {{can often}} be made by stir-frying the <b>fallopian</b> <b>tubes</b> of a pig, before {{chopping}} them up.

50|$|Essure tubal ligationIn {{this method}} of tubal ligation, two small metal and fiber coils are placed in the <b>fallopian</b> <b>tubes.</b> After insertion, scar tissue forms around the coils, {{blocking}} off the <b>fallopian</b> <b>tubes</b> and preventing sperm from reaching the egg.|$|R
25|$|The parts {{outside this}} cord remain separate, and each forms the {{corresponding}} <b>Fallopian</b> <b>tube.</b> The ostium of the <b>fallopian</b> <b>tube</b> remains from the anterior extremity {{of the original}} tubular invagination from the abdominal cavity.|$|E
25|$|The {{infection}} {{usually has}} its {{origin in the}} vagina and ascends to the <b>Fallopian</b> <b>tube</b> from there. Because the infection can spread via the lymph vessels, infection in one <b>Fallopian</b> <b>tube</b> usually leads to infection of the other.|$|E

50|$|Lack of {{functional}} cilia in female <b>Fallopian</b> <b>tubes</b> can cause ectopic pregnancy. A fertilized ovum may {{not reach the}} uterus if the cilia are unable to move it there. In such a case, the ovum will implant in the <b>Fallopian</b> <b>tubes,</b> causing a tubal pregnancy, {{the most common form}} of ectopic pregnancy.|$|R

25|$|Most {{people with}} {{epithelial}} ovarian carcinoma, about two-thirds, have a serous carcinoma, though this proportion is estimated {{as high as}} 80%. Low-grade serous carcinoma is less aggressive than high-grade serous carcinomas, though it does not typically respond well to chemotherapy or hormonal treatments. Serous carcinomas are thought to begin in the <b>Fallopian</b> <b>tube.</b> Histologically, serous adenocarcinomas have psammoma bodies. Low-grade serous adenocarcinomas resemble <b>Fallopian</b> <b>tube</b> epithelium, whereas high-grade serous adenocarcinomas show anaplasia and nuclear atypia.|$|E
25|$|For women, {{problems}} with fertilisation arise mainly from either structural {{problems in the}} <b>Fallopian</b> <b>tube</b> or uterus or problems releasing eggs. Infertility {{may be caused by}} blockage of the <b>Fallopian</b> <b>tube</b> due to malformations, infections such as chlamydia and/or scar tissue. For example, endometriosis can cause infertility with the growth of endometrial tissue in the Fallopian tubes and/or around the ovaries. Endometriosis is usually more common in women in their mid-twenties and older, especially when postponed childbirth has taken place.|$|E
5000|$|Progesterone {{helps the}} embryo implant by {{assisting}} {{passage through the}} <b>fallopian</b> <b>tubes.</b> It also affects the <b>fallopian</b> <b>tubes</b> and the uterus by stimulating an increase in secretions necessary for fetal nutrition. Progesterone, like hCG, is necessary to prevent spontaneous abortion because it prevents contractions of the uterus, and is necessary for implantation.|$|R

25|$|Ectopic {{pregnancy}} is when an embryo implants in the uterine (<b>Fallopian)</b> <b>tube</b> or (rarely) on the ovary or inside the peritoneal cavity. This may cause massive internal bleeding.|$|E
25|$|In zygote intrafallopian {{transfer}} (ZIFT), egg {{cells are}} removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilized in the laboratory; the resulting zygote is then placed into the <b>fallopian</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|E
25|$|Methotrexate is an {{abortifacient}} and {{is commonly}} used to terminate pregnancies during the early stages, generally in combination with misoprostol. It {{is also used to}} treat ectopic pregnancies, provided the <b>fallopian</b> <b>tube</b> has not ruptured.|$|E

50|$|Like the uterine {{endometrium}} of Endometriosis, estrogen {{can cause}} salpingoitic tissues {{outside of the}} <b>fallopian</b> <b>tubes</b> to grow and potentially aggravate the surrounding areas. High levels cause the glandular tissues to proliferate and, especially important, they cause the number of and activity of ciliated epithelial cells (that would normally line the <b>fallopian</b> <b>tubes)</b> to increase.|$|R
5000|$|Tubal {{ligation}} in females, known popularly as [...] "having one's <b>tubes</b> tied". The <b>Fallopian</b> <b>tubes,</b> {{which allow}} the sperm to fertilize the ovum and {{would carry the}} fertilized ovum to the uterus, are closed. This generally involves a general anesthetic and a laparotomy or laparoscopic approach to cut, clip or cauterize the <b>fallopian</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
25|$|An {{abdominal}} pregnancy can {{be regarded}} as a form of an ectopic pregnancy where the embryo or fetus is growing and developing outside the womb in the abdomen, but not in the <b>Fallopian</b> <b>tube,</b> ovary or broad ligament.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of ectopic pregnancies implant in the <b>Fallopian</b> <b>tube.</b> Pregnancies can grow in the fimabrial end (5% of all ectopic pregnancies), the ampullary section (80%), the isthmus (12%), and the cornual and interstitial part of the tube (2%). Mortality of a tubal pregnancy at the isthmus or within the uterus (interstitial pregnancy) is higher as there is increased vascularity that may result more likely in sudden major internal bleeding. A review published in 2010 supports the hypothesis that tubal ectopic pregnancy {{is caused by a}} combination of retention of the embryo within the <b>fallopian</b> <b>tube</b> due to impaired embryo-tubal transport and alterations in the tubal environment allowing early implantation to occur.|$|E
25|$|German {{scientists}} {{have reported that}} a virus called Adeno-associated virus might {{have a role in}} male infertility, though it is otherwise not harmful. Other diseases such as chlamydia, and gonorrhea can also cause infertility, due to internal scarring (<b>fallopian</b> <b>tube</b> obstruction).|$|E

25|$|A hydrosalpinx is a {{distally}} blocked <b>fallopian</b> <b>tube</b> {{filled with}} serous or clear fluid. The blocked tube may become substantially distended giving the tube a characteristic sausage-like or retort-like shape. The condition is often bilateral and the affected tubes may reach several centimeters in diameter. The blocked tubes cause infertility.|$|E
25|$|Spermatozoa are {{produced}} in the seminiferous tubules of the testes in a process called spermatogenesis. Round cells called spermatogonia divide and differentiate eventually to become spermatozoa. During copulation the cloaca or vagina gets inseminated, and then the spermatozoa move through chemotaxis to the ovum inside a <b>Fallopian</b> <b>tube</b> or the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Once it is {{determined}} that ovarian, <b>fallopian</b> <b>tube,</b> or primary peritoneal cancer is present, treatment is scheduled by a gynecologic oncologist (a physician trained to treat cancers of a womanâ€™s reproductive system). Gynecologic oncologists can perform surgery on and give chemotherapy to women with ovarian cancer. A treatment plan is developed.|$|E
