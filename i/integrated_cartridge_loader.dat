40|$|Most modern high {{performance}} storage systems store data in large repositories of removable media volumes. Management of the removable volumes is {{performed by a}} software module known as a Physical Volume Library (PVL). To meet performance and scalability requirements, a PVL {{may be asked to}} mount multiple removable media volumes for use by a single client for parallel data transfer. Mounting sets of volumes creates an environment in which it impossible for multiple client requests to deadlock while attempting to gain access to storage resources. Scenarios leading to deadlock in a PVL include multiple client requests that contend for the same cartridge(s), and client requests that vie for a limited set of drive resources. These deadlock scenarios are further complicated by the potential for out-of-order volumes to be mounted (for example, by Automatic <b>Cartridge</b> <b>Loaders</b> or human operators). This paper begins by introducing those PVL requirements Which create the possibility of deadlock. Next we examine traditional approaches to deadlock resolution and how they might be applied in a PVL. This leads to a design for a PVL which addresses deadlock scenarios. Following the design presentation is a discussion of possible design enhancements. We end with a case study of an actual implementation of the PVL design in the High Performance Storage System (HPSS) ...|$|R

Most fast <b>loader</b> <b>cartridges</b> also incorporated other features to increase ease of use. An on-board implementation of Commodore's DOS Wedge was included in most fast <b>loader</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Machine language monitors, disk editors, and various convenience commands for Commodore BASIC were also common additions. Some fast <b>loader</b> <b>cartridges</b> were very sophisticated, incorporating a reset button, [...] "freeze" [...] capabilities, and a simple onboard GUI. The Final Cartridge III {{was perhaps the most}} successful of this genre. A few commercial fast loaders, most notably CMD's JiffyDOS, were not cartridge-driven but instead replaced the KERNAL ROM in the C64 and the DOS ROM in the 1541. While these were more difficult to install, they offered greatly increased compatibility, being almost invisible to software running on the machine.The cartridge, Action Replay MK6 RAM loader loads a 202 block program in around 9 seconds. Its Warp loader is 25 times faster, but programs can only be loaded with a loader saved to disk when the cartridge is not present.Whereas the ARMK6 fastloader was compatible with most software, the TFC III was known to crash often, so programs had to be loaded in normal C64 mode, deactivating the cartridge, making it more or less useless.|$|R

Instrumentation and systems were developed to interface such cartridge systems: (i) implementing microfluidic handling, (ii) executing thermal control during biochemical protocols and (iii) detection of biomolecules associated with inherited or infectious disease. This system implements biochemical protocols for DNA extraction, amplification and detection. A digital microfluidic chip (ElectroWetting on Dielectric) manipulated droplets of sample and reagent implementing sample preparation protocols.

In a technique allowing probe DNA to be immobilised within a microfluidic system using (3 D) hydrogel structures a prepolymer solution containing probe DNA was formulated and introduced into the microfluidic channel. Photo-polymerisation was undertaken forming 3 D hydrogel structures attached to the microfluidic channel surface. The prepolymer material, poly-ethyleneglycol (PEG), was used to form hydrogel structures containing probe DNA. This hydrogel formulation process was fast compared to conventional biomolecule immobilization techniques and was also biocompatible with the immobilised biomolecules, as verified by on-chip hybridisation assays.

40|$|RNA {{isolation}} is a ubiquitous need, driven by current emphasis on microarrays and miniaturization. With commercial systems requiring 100, 000 to 1, 000, 000 cells for successful isolation, {{there is a}} growing need for a small-footprint, easy-to-use device that can harvest nucleic acids from much smaller cell samples (1, 000 to 10, 000 cells). The process of extraction of RNA from cell cultures is a complex, multi-step one, and requires timed, asynchronous operations with multiple reagents/buffers. An added complexity is the fragility of RNA (subject to degradation) and its reactivity to surface. A novel, microfluidics-based, <b>integrated</b> <b>cartridge</b> has been developed that can fully automate the complex process of RNA isolation (lyse, capture, and elute RNA) from small cell culture samples. On-cartridge cell lysis is achieved using either reagents or high-strength electric fields made possible by the miniaturized format. Traditionally, silica-based, porous-membrane formats have been used for RNA capture, requiring slow perfusion for effective capture. In this design, high efficiency capture/elution are achieved using a microsphere-based "microfluidized" format. Electrokinetic phenomena are harnessed to actively mix microspheres with the cell lysate and capture/elution buffer, providing important advantages in extraction efficiency, processing time, and operational flexibility. Successful RNA isolation was demonstrated using both suspension (HL- 60) and adherent (BHK- 21) cells. Novel features associated with this development are twofold. First, novel designs that execute needed processes with improved speed and efficiency were developed. These primarily encompass electric-field-driven lysis of cells. The configurations include electrode-containing constructs, or an "electrode-less" chip design, which is easy to fabricate and mitigates fouling at the electrode surface; and the "fluidized" extraction format based on electrokinetically assisted mixing and contacting of microbeads in a shape-optimized chamber. A secondary proprietary feature is in the particular layout integrating these components to perform the desired operation of RNA isolation. Apart from a novel functional capability, advantages of the innovation include reduced or eliminated use of toxic reagents, and operator-independent extraction of RNA...|$|R

40|$|The full {{blood cell}} (FBC) count {{is the most}} common {{indicator}} of diseases. At present hematology analyzers are used for the blood cell characterization, but, recently, there has been interest in using techniques that take advantage of microscale devices and intrinsic properties of cells for increased automation and decreased cost. Microfluidic technologies offer solutions to handling and processing small volumes of blood (2 - 50 uL taken by finger prick) for point-of-care(PoC) applications. Several PoC blood analyzers are in use and may have applications in the fields of telemedicine, out patient monitoring and medical care in resource limited settings. They have the advantage to be easy to move and much cheaper than traditional analyzers, which require bulky instruments and consume large amount of reagents. The development of miniaturized point-of-care diagnostic tests may be enabled by chip-based technologies for cell separation and sorting. Many current diagnostic tests depend on fractionated blood components: plasma, red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. Specifically, white blood cell differentiation and counting provide valuable information for diagnostic purposes. For example, a low number of WBCs, called leukopenia, may be an indicator of bone marrow deficiency or failure, collagen- vascular diseases, disease of the liver or spleen. The leukocytosis, a high number of WBCs, may be due to anemia, infectious diseases, leukemia or tissue damage. In the laboratory of hybrid biodevices, at the University of Southampton,it was developed a functioning micro impedance cytometer technology for WBC differentiation and counting. It is capable to classify cells and particles on the base of their dielectric properties, in addition to their size, without the need of labeling, in a flow format similar to that of a traditional flow cytometer. It was demonstrated that the micro impedance cytometer system can detect and differentiate monocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes, which are the three major human leukocyte populations. The simplicity and portability of the microfluidic impedance chip offer a range of potential applications in cell analysis including point-of-care diagnostic systems. The microfluidic device has been integrated into a sample preparation cartridge that semi-automatically performs erythrocyte lysis before leukocyte analysis. Generally erythrocytes are manually lysed according to a specific chemical lysis protocol, but this process has been automated in the cartridge.

Centrifugo-pneumatic siphon valves are particularly suited for blood processing as they function without need of surface treatment and are 'low-pass', i. e., holding at high centrifugation speeds and opening upon reduction of the spin rate. Both 'hydrostatically' and 'hydrodynamically' triggered centrifugo-pneumatic siphon valving schemes are presented. Firstly, the geometry of the pneumatic chamber of hydrostatically primed centrifugo-pneumatic siphon valves is optimised to enable smooth and uniform layering of blood {{on top of the}} density-gradient medium; this feature proves to be key for efficient Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell extraction. A theoretical analysis of hydrostatically primed valves is also presented which determines the optimum priming pressure for the individual valves.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: A common {{denominator}} shared by several HIV- 1 reactivation agents such as certain cytokines, UV irradiation and heat shock is {{their ability to}} cause stress response. Consequently, we have investigated the effects of oxidative stress on HIV- 1 reactivation, knowing that HIV- 1 latently infected T cells can be exposed in vivo to such a stress when blood phagocytes are stimulated during inflammatory reactions. METHODS: The promonocytic (U 1) and lymphocytic (ACH- 2) cell lines, both HIV- 1 chronically infected, were used to study the reactivation phenomenon. To test wether HIV- 1 reactivation is mediated by LTR transactivation, the HeLa HIV- 1 CAT cell line, which carries an <b>integrated</b> DNA <b>cartridge</b> containing CAT gene under control of HIV- 1 LTR, was also exposed to an oxidative stress. RESULTS: Hydrogen peroxide exposure of U 1 cells leads to an increased reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in supernatant fluid. Over the optimal concentrations range (0. 5 to 1 mM), a four to fivefold stimulation level is reached. Below these concentrations, stress conditions are not sufficient and above, they induce a too important lethal effect. Immunofluorescence carried out on stressed U 1 cells shows that H 2 O 2 leads to HIV- 1 gene expression activation and not to a release of viral particles from damaged cells. H 2 O 2 also induces a stimulation of CAT activity in HeLa HIV- 1 CAT cells. Intracellular singulet oxygen (1 O 2) is also able to induce an increase of RT activity in supernatant fluid of U 1 and ACH- 2 cells and a stimulation of CAT activity in HeLa HIV- 1 CAT cells. A dose-response curve can also be demonstrated. In order to transpose these in vitro experiments to situations encountered in vivo, activated phagocytes were cocultivated with HeLa HIV- 1 CAT cells. A weak stimulation of CAT activity was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Cellular oxidative damages induce HIV- 1 LTR transactivation leading to viral gene expression and consequently to a burst of virus production. DNA damages induced by oxidative stress could be {{at the onset of}} HIV- 1 reactivation. Experiments are now in progress to elucidate the mechanisms leading to HIV- 1 reactivation after an oxidative stress...|$|R

The system features {{a high degree of}} modularity and integration. Modularity allows the adaption of common and established assay types of various formats. Integration lets the system move from the laboratory to the point-of-need. By making use of the microarray format the lab-on-chip system also addresses new trends in biomedicine. Research topics such as personalized medicine or companion diagnostics show that multiparameter analyses are an added value for diagnostics, therapy as well as therapy control. These goals are addressed with a low-cost and self-contained cartridge, since reagents, microfluidic actuators and various sensors are <b>integrated</b> within the <b>cartridge.</b> In combination with a fully automated instrumentation (read-out and processing unit) a diagnostic assay can be performed in about 15 min. Via a user-friendly interface the read-out unit itself performs the assay protocol, data acquisition and data analysis. So far, example assays for nucleic acids (detection of different pathogens) and protein markers (such as CRP and PSA) have been established using an electrochemical read-out based on redoxcycling or an optical read-out based on total internal reflectance fluorescence (TIRF). It could be shown that the assay performance within the cartridge is similar to that found for the same assay in a microtiter plate. Furthermore, recent developments are the integration of sample preparation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on-chip. Hence, the instrument is capable of providing heating-and-cooling cycles necessary for DNA-amplification. In addition to scientific aspects also the production of such a lab-on-chip system was part of the development since this heavily affects the success of a later market launch. In summary, the Fraunhofer ivD-platform covers the whole value chain ranging from microfluidics, material and polymer sciences, assay and sensor development to the production and assembly design. In this consortium the gap between diagnostic needs and available technologies can be closed...|$|R
40|$|The air {{we breathe}} is {{the concern of}} all of us but {{nevertheless}} we only know very little about airborne particles, and especially which biological microorganisms they contain. Today, we live in densely populated societies with a growing number of people, making us particularly vulnerable to air transmission of pathogens. With the recent appearance of highly pathogenic types of avian influenza in southeast Asia and the seasonal outbreaks of gastroenteritis caused by the extremely contagious norovirus, the need for portable, sensitive and rapid instruments for on-site detection and monitoring of airborne pathogens is apparent. Unfortunately, the integration incompatibility between state-of-the-art air sampling techniques and laboratory based analysis methods makes instruments for in-the-field rapid detection of airborne particles an unresolved challenge. This thesis aims at addressing this challenge by the development of novel manufacturing, integration and sampling techniques to enable the use of label-free biosensors for rapid and sensitive analysis of airborne particles at the point-of-care or in the field. The first part of the thesis introduces a novel reaction injection molding technique for the fabrication of high quality microfluidic cartridges. In addition, electrically controlled liquid aspiration and dispensing is presented, based on the use of a thermally actuated polymer composite <b>integrated</b> with microfluidic <b>cartridges.</b> The second part of the thesis demonstrates three different approaches of biosensor integration with microfluidic cartridges, with a focus on simplifying the design and integration to enable disposable use of the cartridges. The third part to the thesis presents a novel air sampling technique based on electrophoretic transport of airborne particles directly to microfluidic cartridges. This technique is enabled by the development of a novel microstructured component for integrated air-liquid interfacing. In addition, a method for liquid sample mixing with magnetic microbeads prior to downstream biosensing is demonstrated. In the fourth part of the thesis, three different applications for airborne particle biosensing are introduced and preliminary experimental results are presented.

40|$|Miniaturization of {{chemical}} analysis and synthesis systems improve throughput, performance and accessibility, {{and lead to}} significantly reduced costs. In this work are described several components that find place {{in the process of}} miniaturization. This work is developed in the frame of the project CREAM (Cartridges with molecularly imprinted Recognition Elements for Antibiotic residues Monitoring in Milk). Antibiotics are widely used to treat cows' diseases, and traces can be found in milk some days after treatment. The presence of antibiotics in milk represents a potential human health hazard, and can present problems for cheese and yoghourt makers. The aim of this work is to produce a device able to detect the presence of antibiotics in milk. This device should be the most compact as possible, and have to reduce the cost of the analysis. A plastic replication technique by cast molding is developed in order to quickly produce plastic prototypes starting from a master made in silicon and photoresist (SU- 8). By exploiting capillary effect, is developed a stop flow valve. The valve is integrated in a microfluidic device realized by DRIE (Deep Reactive Ion Etching) on a silicon wafer. It consists in a vertical capillary connecting the channel on top of the wafer, to the expansion chamber etched on the back-side. The device is finally closed by anodic bonding with two pyrex lid. Passive stop flow valves are used to realize a sample metering system. Such a system consists in an introduction port for the sample, a capillary and two valves, one of which acts as air vent. Furthermore a micro drier is developed using the functioning principle of the stop flow valve. The application of this device it to change the liquid phase of a solution, in particular in the project CREAM in necessary to change an aqueous solution into an almost pure solution of acetonitrile. A new optical detection cell design is fabricated. It consists on an array of channels open at the end, the meniscus formed at the outlet of each channel provides a direct air-liquid interface to the sample volume, through which light could be injected. This optical detection cell is <b>integrated</b> in a <b>cartridge</b> with a microreactor and a sample metering system. The microreactor is packed with MIPs (Molecular Imprinted Polymers) and characterized from the fluidic point of view. The whole cartridge is finally optically characterized with pyrene butyric aci...|$|R
