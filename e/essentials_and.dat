40|$|This study {{examined}} three methodological approaches to defining the critical elements of Illness Management and Recovery (IMR), a curriculum-based approach to recovery. Sixty-seven IMR experts rated the criticality of 16 IMR elements on three dimensions: defining, <b>essential,</b> <b>and</b> impactful. Three elements (Recovery Orientation, Goal Setting and Follow-up, and IMR Curriculum) met all criteria for <b>essential</b> <b>and</b> defining {{and all but}} the most stringent criteria for impactful. Practitioners should consider competence in these areas as preeminent. The remaining 13 elements met varying criteria for <b>essential</b> <b>and</b> impactful. Findings suggest that criticality is a multifaceted construct, necessitating judgments about model elements across different criticality dimensions...|$|R

500|$|The {{popularity}} of Microsoft Security Essentials {{has led to}} the appearance of malware abusing its name. In February 2010, a rogue security package calling itself [...] "Security Essentials 2010" [...] appeared on the Internet. Designated TrojanDownloader:Win32/Fakeinit by Microsoft, it bears no visual resemblance to the Microsoft product. It reappeared in November 2010, this time calling itself [...] "Microsoft Security Essentials 2011". A more dangerous rogue appeared in August 2010. Designated Rogue:Win32/FakePAV or Unknown Win32/Trojan, it closely resembles Microsoft Security <b>Essentials</b> <b>and</b> uses sophisticated social engineering to deceive users and infect their systems, under the guise of five different fictional anti-malware products. It also terminates and prevents the launch of 156 different programs, including Registry Editor, Windows Command Prompt, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari and Google Chrome.|$|E

[...] Charles Holden described Pick's management of meetings: [...] "Here his decisions were those of a benevolent dictator, and the members left the meeting with a clear sense of a task to be performed, difficult, perhaps, and sometimes impossible, as might subsequently prove to be, but usually well worth exploring if only in producing convincing proof of obstacles. Out of these exploratory methods there often emerged new and most interesting solutions, which Pick was quick to appreciate, and to adopt in substitution for his own proposals." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the series' production, Bruce Wayne, {{chronicling the}} young protagonist's journey toward Batman, was {{proposed}} first. Although that series failed to generate interest, it inspired Smallville. Series developers Gough and Millar pitched their [...] "no tights, no flights" [...] rule {{to the president}} of Warner Bros. Television, reducing Superman to the bare <b>essentials</b> <b>and</b> examining what led Clark Kent to become the Man of Steel. After seven seasons with the show, Gough and Millar departed with little explanation. Smallville was primarily filmed in and around Vancouver, British Columbia, with local businesses and buildings substituting for Smallville locations. Most of the music for the first six seasons was composed by Mark Snow, who incorporated elements of John Williams' musical score from the Superman film series. In season seven, Louis Febre (who worked with Snow from the beginning) became the series' primary composer.|$|E
500|$|The fifth, and last, of David's volumes {{consisting}} {{primarily of}} recipes {{is by far}} the longest of them. The 1970 paperback edition published by Penguin Books runs to 584 pages. David's biographer Artemis Cooper describes it as [...] "a book that only needed assembling", because it was based on previously published articles and her own collection of notes and recipes from the previous two decades. David researched her recipes thoroughly, and whenever several supposedly classic and mutually contradictory recipes existed she [...] "knew how to reduce a recipe to its bare <b>essentials,</b> <b>and</b> then reconstruct it". By the 1960s, she was described in the British press as [...] "the most revered goddess of cooking", and The Observer said, [...] "It is difficult to think of any home that can do without [...] Elizabeth David's [...] French Provincial Cooking.|$|E

500|$|The English {{translation}} for Secret of Mana {{was completed}} in only 30 days, mere weeks after the Japanese release, and the North American localization was initially advertised as Final Fantasy Adventure 2. Critics {{have suggested that the}} translation was done hastily so that the game could be released in North America for the 1993 holiday season. According to translator Ted Woolsey, {{a large portion of the}} game's script was cut out in the English localization due to space limitations. To display text on the main gameplay screen, the English translation uses a fixed-width font, which limits the amount of space available to display text. Woolsey was unhappy that he had to trim conversations to their bare <b>essentials</b> <b>and</b> that he had so little time for translation, commenting that it [...] "nearly killed me". The script was difficult to translate as it was presented to Woolsey in disordered groups of text, like [...] "shuffling a novel". Other localizations were done in German and French. The Japanese release only named the three protagonists in the manual, while Western versions omitted the characters' names until the enhanced port on the iOS.|$|E
