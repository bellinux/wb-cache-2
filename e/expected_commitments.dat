The article follows how an {{ordinary}} Ottoman subject was consciously able to create a political niche through different lingual, ethnic identities, citizenships, and even legal jurisdictions.

40|$|To {{conduct a}} meta-ethnographic {{study of the}} experiences, {{meanings}} and ways of 'dealing with' symptoms or a diagnosis of postnatal depression amongst migrant women living in high income countries. Prevalence of postnatal depression is highest amongst women who are migrants. Yet many women do not seek help for their symptoms and health services do not always respond appropriately to migrant women's needs. Studies have reported migrant women's experiences of postnatal depression and it is timely to synthesise findings from these studies to understand how services can be improved. A meta-ethnographic synthesis of 12 studies reported in 15 papers. Five databases were searched for papers published between January 1999 and February 2016. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool. The synthesis process was guided by the seven steps of meta-ethnography outlined by Noblit and Hare. Four key metaphors were identified: "I am alone, worried and angry-this is not me!"; 'Making sense of my feelings' 'Dealing with my feelings' and 'What I {{need to change the}} way I feel!'. Primarily women related their feelings to their position as a migrant and as women, often living in poor socio-economic circumstances and they were exhausted keeping up with <b>expected</b> <b>commitments.</b> Many women were resourceful, drawing on their personal strengths and family / community resources. All the studies reported that women experienced difficulties in accessing appropriate services. The meta-ethnographic study demonstrates the impact of migration on perinatal mental health, particularly for women lacking family support, who have no employment, a precarious migration status and/or relationship conflict. Migrant women are resourceful and this requires support through appropriate services. Further research is needed to evaluate effective support strategies for migrant women in the perinatal period...|$|E

The Air Force project officer who reviewed the Model 464-40 was favorably impressed, especially since he had already been thinking along similar lines. Nevertheless, the government was concerned about the high fuel consumption rate of the jet engines of the day, and directed that Boeing still use the turboprop-powered Model 464-35 {{as the basis for the}} XB-52. Although he agreed that turbojet propulsion was the future, General Howard A.

However, Boeing was encouraged to continue turbojet studies even without any <b>expected</b> <b>commitment</b> to jet propulsion.|$|R

40|$|In the {{conventional}} optimal monetary policy framework, two key assumptions underline the full commitment solution : Monetary authority is perfectly credible, and can commit for {{an infinite number}} of periods. Using a baseline forward-looking model, this study explores the implications of relaxing these assumptions in turn. First, finite lasting commitments are introduced using a stochastic exogenous process that generates policy reoptimizations. As a consequence, monetary policy is characterized with a continuum from pure discretion to full commitment. Second, we solve the optimal and robust targeting rules when the central bank confronts imperfect and/or uncertain credibility. Imperfect credibility is defined as {{a situation in which the}} private sector <b>expects</b> the <b>commitment</b> regime to end sooner than that is intended by the policy maker. The results indicate that, under imperfect credibility, optimal policy becomes observationally closer to the discretionary solution, the more being so as the degree of uncertainty rises. These findings may be insightful for explaining the observed near-discretionary behavior of the central banks, which indeed operate under imperfect credibility.

At the same time, the potential conflict of interests between company’s shareholders and management could be solved by allocation of appropriate management incentives. As the effectiveness of management incentives depends on their good evaluation, it is important to identify potential indicators and to measure their consistency with the value created to business owners. Moreover we have identified financial measures for manager’s contribution to the company operations, used as a criterion for entitlement to managers’ incentives.

Within this framework we can understand why, in specific contexts of uncertainty and complexity, voluntary agreements are both a result and an instrument of the regulatory process. They avoid the pitfalls of a law. They may also stimulate co-ordinated learning and exploratory actions in a competitive context even when there are no strong economic incentives or assessed technological solutions at the outset to bring about a collective improvement. The same theoretical perspectives can highlight the drawbacks that threaten such agreements and indicate a dynamic pattern of increasing interventionism. A general regulation strategy can thus be defined in three phases: 1) establishment of a VA; 2) if necessary, reinforcement through legal standards and policy monitoring; 3) if - and only if - environmental goals are not attained, taxes and regulation might be considered. The latter instruments are applied when enough knowledge is available to limit perverse effects. This strategy is profoundly meaningful: public intervention requires knowledge, but also guides the production of knowledge. Hence, any intervention strategy has to be based on a specific and explicit pattern of collective learning. The carwaste case, studied by the authors {{over the past four years}} with Renault, is used to illustrate these different points. A new model of state intervention is derived from this case and its validity is explored through a comparative study with other cases...|$|R
30|$|The {{relationship}} between a coach and athlete has similarities wit the {{relationship between}} a supervisor and an employee in an organizational setting. Similar to a supervisor, a coach has formal authority and may utilize both influence without authority and influence with authority when engaging with the athlete (Dansereau et al. 1975). This ability to employ both formal contractual and informal influence gives that the coach and the athlete some degrees of control over the type of relationship, or exchange that will exist between them. In the process of organizing their roles, the type of influence the coach employs affect the interpersonal exchange {{relationship between a}} coach and his/her athlete (Dansereau et al. 1975). The norm of reciprocity indicates that when the coach offers the athlete more latitude in things like decision making and signals the coach’s trust, respect, and support for the athlete, the athlete may then feel obligated to reciprocate with behaviours that would fulfill the coach’s expectation (Gouldner 1960). This belief in coach’s values and willingness to exert effort on his/her behalf is the basis for commitment to the coach. We therefore <b>expect</b> that <b>commitment</b> to the coach to be associated with student-athlete in-role behaviour.|$|R

OBJECTIVE: To summarize work conducted on a scoping review of interventions focussing on patient involvement for patient safety; to develop consensus-based recommendations in this area. METHODS: Scoping {{review of the literature}} 2006 - 2011 about methods and effects of involving patients in patient safety in primary care identified evidence for previous experiences of patient involvement in patient safety. This information was fed back to an expert panel for the development of recommendations for healthcare professionals and policy makers. RESULTS: The scoping review identified only weak evidence in support of the effectiveness of patient involvement. Identified barriers included a number of patient factors but also the healthcare workers' attitudes, abilities and lack of training. The expert panel recommended the integration of patient safety in the educational curricula for healthcare professionals, and <b>expected</b> a <b>commitment</b> from professionals to act as first movers by inviting and encouraging the patients to take an active role.
