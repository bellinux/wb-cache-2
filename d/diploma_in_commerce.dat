The diploma is aimed at improving skills in three key, high value-added sectors for Gozo, namely ICT, tourism and financial services. Mature students, who are employed in Gozo or are raising a family, cannot normally follow courses in Malta, even those offered on a part-time basis, so the University Gozo Campus offers the Gozitan Community a unique opportunity to follow University courses in Gozo. The DipCom and the B. Com courses funded by the EU go a step further in making them more attractive for Gozitan students as the student fees are waived. N/...|$|E
