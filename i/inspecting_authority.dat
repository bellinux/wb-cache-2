5000|$|After {{the scam}} was {{unfolded}} the RBI restricted the cooperative banks from providing money to brokerage firms, giving assistance against securities such as shares and debentures and formed task forces to formulate revival {{plans for the}} banks that were affected. In most cases the affected bank was merged to a bigger Urban Cooperative Bank. The banking regulatory authority {{increased the number of}} inspections of balance sheets of cooperative banks from once in two years to every year. A parliamentary panel was set up to investigate in the stock market scam. The panel found out that the urban cooperative banks were manipulating their activities and that in absence of any <b>inspecting</b> <b>authority</b> many brokerage firms were using funds provided by these banks to manipulate the market. After the scam cooperative banks found it difficult to win back the trust and confidence of their customers. Chairman of the National Federation of Urban Cooperative Banks & Credit Societies Ltd, H K Patil had said;The MMCB episode came as a big storm to the cooperative movement. However, the movement withstood and overcome the storm and for past few years, cooperative banks are seen doing fairly well. The regulator, too, has taken a note of the operations of UCBs,The Bank filed a large number of cases against various defaulters. CID and Central Bureau of Investigation filed several charge sheets. In the case, a defaulter agreed to pay back the withstanding amount case against him was closed. Over 40 cases against defaulters were still pending in Mumbai as of July 2012. Government bodies like Bank of India and Deposit Insurance & Credit Guarantee Corporation were given priority for due recovery. After the scam Securities and Exchange Board of India, the regulatory body for the Indian stock markets was given more power in investigating cases against manipulation and insider trading and to impose heavy penalty and initiate criminal proceedings. Chartered accounted M.M. Chitale {{played a key role in}} the formulation and execution of restructuring scheme. The committee under Chitale recommended that the bank should be allowed to make payments under an restructuring scheme. He refused to accept any fees for his work. MMCB repaid [...] due to 268 banks in installments.The RBI issued a circular on 21 July 2004 to the banks that had deposited money with the MMCB to treat their deposits to the bank as non-performing assets and submit the particulars of their deposits to the reserve bank. MMCB auctioned properties of defaulters worth [...] on 3 November 2004. Parekh was arrested after the scam garnered media attention. A lower court granted him bail on the condition that he will pay back [...] to the bank in three years ending 24 August 2004. He failed to fulfill the condition and filed a plea in the Gujarat High Court to change the terms and conditions of the bail but the court asked him to withdraw the plea. Ketan Parekh offered to pay [...] in 5 installments by May 2005 but the MMCB rejected his proposal.

40|$|This paper applies Hofstede’s {{cultural}} dimensions {{into the}} shipping industry and analyzes the culture effects on vessel detention. All ships {{have their own}} nationality but the flag control is manageably sophisticated. Substandard ships are aware of high risks, and quality control of ships {{is critical to the}} maritime safety and security. It has been proved that the detention rate depends on the flag of registry together with ship age, <b>inspecting</b> <b>authority,</b> type of ship, and recognized organization influencing. Previous research has focused on the performance of individual flag of registry in terms of casualty and detention rate. This study considers the collective characteristics of flags according to culture effects and their influences on ship quality. Based on Hofstede’s five‐dimension culture theory, we map the flag states on culture dimensions. From 12, 635 detention records of the Tokyo MOU region from 2000 to 2009, we determine the effect of culture dimensions against the vessel detention. The findings can be summarised in two aspects. First, the power distance index has little influences on the detention rate. Second, more importantly, the individualism, uncertainty avoidance index and long‐term orientation have positively impacts on the number of detentions. Our findings show that culture indeed has an effect on the vessel detention taken by different Port State Controls. A further look on the flag of registry is that the performance of individual flags may be better illustrated if individual flags are classified according to culture dimensions. This paper is organised as follows: Section 1 introduces the background; Section 2 discusses related literature; Section 3 considers the data collection and methodology; Section 4 concerns the findings; and Section 5 addresses conclusions and further research.

40|$|Target factors aim at setting {{criteria}} to select foreign vessels {{that should be}} inspected by port state control authorities. Although a relative consensus exists on the main factors to consider in selecting vessels, the weight {{to be given to}} these factors is still unclear. Using data on 26 515 PSC inspections that took place within the Indian Ocean MoU region from 2002 to 2006, we investigate the determinants of the number of deficiencies and of the probability of detention. Our results show that the main contributors to detention are the age of the vessel at inspection (40 %), the recognised organization (31 %) and the place where the inspection occurs (17 %). Also, differences in detention rates amongst various <b>inspecting</b> <b>authorities</b> are essentially explained by differences in the characteristics of vessels calling in a specific country rather than by differences in the way inspections are done.

40|$|A key {{recommendation}} of the Burgner report on regulation and inspection of social services was {{that the cost of}} regulation should be independently reviewed with a view to relating fee levels more closely to the actual costs of regulation (Burgner, 1996; p 8). Data collected on a regular basis suggest that the current fee structure is heavily subsidised by <b>inspecting</b> <b>authorities</b> and that there is considerable variation in the degree to which fee income falls short of expenditure on regulation. In addition {{there are a number of}} important planned changes in the way that the regulatory function is to be conducted in the future (Department of Health, 1998). These include the setting up of independent regional authorities responsible for regulating care services, the extension of regulatory requirements to services not currently covered by regulatory legislation and the setting of standards at a national level. There will clearly be a need for an understanding of the costs of the current arrangements before the cost implications of any changes can be considered.

Between 1967 and 1978 low-level and intermediate-level radioactive waste were emplaced in 13 chambers in the Asse II mine. Two chambers are located in the middle part and ten in the southern flank of the mine at depths from 725 m to 750 m below surface. Between 1972 and 1977, exclusively medium-level radioactive waste was emplaced in a chamber on the 511 m level. Research was stopped in 1995; between 1995 and 2004 cavities were filled with salt.After media reports in 2008 about brine contaminated with radioactive caesium-137, plutonium and strontium, politicians accused the operator, Helmholtz Zentrum München - German Research Center for Environmental Health, of not having informed the <b>inspecting</b> <b>authorities.</b> On 8 September 2008, the responsible ministers of Lower Saxony and the German government replaced the operator with Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz - the Federal Office for Radiation Protection.

Their major aim is to reveal these insanitary and deceptively marked products and withdraw them from circulation. The requirements for marking of products aren?t simply and completely clearly defined even today, after the progressive harmonization with the prescriptions of the European Union. Concrete requirements for marking of foodstuff can be found in the Food Act No. 110 / 1997 Coll. and its implementing decrees including a special decree about the forms of marking of foodstuff No. 113 / 2005 Coll. Specific demands for marking of individual groups of products are given in decrees for particular commodities. It isn?t easy to draw up a comprehensive picture of all requirements for marking of a concrete product. In order to use the text on the cover, the consumer needs to know what?s hiding under certain words and what do the individual marks on the cover mean. The aim of the diploma thesis was to judge the compliance of legislation for marking of selected food products ? meat products, dairy products, spices and spice mixtures.
