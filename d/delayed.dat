5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., acting-out disorders) show {{a clearer}} link to <b>delayed</b> gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents, as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 study found that the contrast in <b>delayed</b> gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with <b>delayed</b> gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and <b>delayed</b> gratification, and suggests that the tie between <b>delayed</b> gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E

In two experiments, college students completed 45 sets of Holland and Skinner's (1961) programmed text on behavior analysis in a computerized format in a three-component multiple schedule. In Experiment 1, the conditions were (a) no <b>delay</b> between questions, (b) a 10 -s <b>delay</b> after each question (noncontingent <b>delay),</b> and (c) a 10 -s <b>delay</b> after each question answered incorrectly (contingent <b>delay).</b> Noncontingent <b>delay</b> produced better performance than no <b>delay</b> and contingent <b>delay.</b> To determine whether performance {{increased in the}} noncontingent <b>delay</b> condition because subjects studied the material during <b>delay</b> periods, Experiment 2 tested three conditions: (a) no <b>delay</b> between questions, (b) a 10 -s <b>delay</b> after each question (noncontingent <b>delay),</b> and (c) a 10 -s <b>delay</b> after each question with the screen blank during the <b>delay</b> period. Noncontingent <b>delay</b> produced better performance than no <b>delay,</b> {{but there was no}} difference in performance between no <b>delay</b> and noncontingent <b>delay</b> with blank screen.

40|$|Abstract — Wireline signal {{processing}} circuits such as transversal equalizers rely on true time <b>delay.</b> An active analog <b>delay</b> stage is proposed {{that requires a}} sixteenth of the area of a comparable LC <b>delay</b> line. A <b>delay</b> reference loop is also presented to tune the <b>delay</b> stage against process, voltage, and temperature variations. A reference signal is introduced to tune the <b>delay.</b> The impact of non-idealities must be considered to {{understand the relationship between}} the reference frequency and the locked time <b>delay.</b> A SiGe BiCMOS implementation of the active analog <b>delay</b> stage and <b>delay</b> reference loop is presented that operates to 10 Gb/s. Index Terms — <b>delay</b> reference loop, <b>delay</b> locked loop, true time <b>delay,</b> analog <b>delay,</b> equalization, tapped-delay lines Accurate <b>delay</b> requires robustness to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Proper <b>delay</b> tuning is achieved with a <b>delay</b> reference loop (DRL). The DRL employs a reference frequency to stabilize the time <b>delay.</b> This reference frequency might come from an off-chip source or the locally regenerated clock {{in the case of an}} equalizer. As opposed to delay-locked loops that shift the <b>delay</b> to align an unknown signal, the DRL adjusts the <b>delay</b> to a given reference tone. However, the relationship between the locked <b>delay</b> and the reference frequency is influenced by circuit non-idealities. I...|$|R

30|$|For the <b>delay</b> {{between two}} network entities, it usually {{refers to the}} RTT (round trip time) from a source to a destination, which is {{composed}} of four types of <b>delay,</b> such as transmission <b>delay,</b> propagation <b>delay,</b> processing <b>delay,</b> and queuing <b>delay.</b> Transmission <b>delay</b> is {{the time needed to}} place a packet onto a link; propagation <b>delay</b> represents the time that is needed for a packet to reach from the source end of a link to the destination end; processing <b>delay</b> is the time needed for an intermediate router (on the path from the source to a destination) or a destination to do data extraction, error checking, and forwarding; and the queuing <b>delay</b> is the time that the packet is waiting for process on the intermediate router. Thus, it can be seen, for the above four types of <b>delay,</b> that only the propagation <b>delay</b> is related to distance. While the propagation <b>delay</b> cannot be directly measured and the RTT is easy to be measured, geolocation algorithm usually uses half of the smallest RTT between two network entities as the propagation <b>delay.</b> This is because small RTT usually means small processing <b>delay</b> and send <b>delay,</b> and propagation <b>delay</b> is a larger proportion of RTT.|$|R
