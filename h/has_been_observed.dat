Although greater scaups are rare in Pennsylvania away from Lake Erie, one <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> at the lake in July 1992. Franklin's gulls <b>have</b> also <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> near the lake, as have snow buntings and black-legged kittiwakes, and ruddy ducks. Nine brant geese <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> on the lake in May 1997.|$|R

50|$|Several unnamed asteroids travel {{closer to}} the Sun than 3200 Phaethon, but none <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> to outgas, which does not imply they do not, because none of these <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>observed</b> in detail, and it is {{possible}} that detailed observations could show some outgassing.|$|R
