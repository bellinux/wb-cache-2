50|$|Iloprost is a {{synthetic}} analogue of prostacyclin PGI2. Iloprost dilates systemic and pulmonary arterial vascular beds. It also affects platelet aggregation but {{the relevance of}} this effect {{to the treatment of}} pulmonary hypertension is unknown. The two <b>diastereoisomers</b> of iloprost differ in their potency in dilating blood vessels, with the 4S isomer substantially more potent than the 4R isomer. While Iloprost is an analog of PGI2 that activates PGI2's receptor, the Prostacyclin receptor, to stimulate vasodilation, it has little selectivity in that it binds to and activates all four receptors for prostaglandin E2 viz., Prostaglandin EP1 receptor, Prostaglandin EP2 receptor, Prostaglandin EP3 receptor, and Prostaglandin EP4 receptor. Activation of the EP2 and EP4 receptors cause vasodilation but activation of the EP3 receptor causes vasoconstriction.|$|E
50|$|RvEs are di- or tri-hydroxyl {{metabolites}} of EPA. To date, four RvE's {{have been}} described: RvE1 (5S,12R,18R-trihydroxy-EPA), 18S-Rv1 (5S,12R,18S-trihydroxy-EPA), RvE2 (5S,18R-dihydroxy-EPA), and RvE3 (17R,18R/S-dihydroxy-EPA). (Structures of the RvEs are further defined at Specialized proresolving mediators#EPA-derived Resolvins.)

Resolvin Es are formed in manner similar to AT resolving T's. COX-2 modified in activity by aspirin or atorvastatin or, alternatively, a microbial or possibly mammalian cytochrome P450 monoxygenase metabolizes EPA to its 18R-hydroperoxy derivative; this intermediate is then further metabolized by ALOX5 to a 5,6 epoxide which is hydrolyzed enzymatically or non-enzymatically to RvE1 and 18S-RvE1 or reduced to RvE2; alternatively the 18R-hydroperoxide is converted to the 17R,18S vicinal diol product, RvE3.|$|E

50|$|Retosiban is a cyclic {{dipeptide}} or 2,5-diketopiperazine {{and these}} are formed by cyclising the corresponding linear dipeptide. In the short and highly stereoselective synthesis of Retosiban 8 the linear peptide 5 is formed by the four-component Ugi reaction of the carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protected R-indanylglycine 1, D-alloisoleucine methyl ester hydrochloride 2, 2-methyloxazole-4-carboxaldehyde 3 and 2-benzyloxyphenylisonitrile 4. Hydrogenation to remove the Cbz and benzyl protecting groups, enabled cyclization of the linear peptide 5 to occur to give the phenolic cyclic dipeptide 6. Hydrolysis of the phenolic amide, by reaction with carbonyl diimidazole (CDI), followed addition of aqueous hydrochloric acid gave the acid 7 which was converted to the amide Retosiban 8 by activating the acid with the peptide coupling reagent PyBOP (benzotriazol-1-yloxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate) followed {{by the addition of}} morpholine.Although the linear peptide 5 and the cyclic dipeptide 6 are a mixture of <b>diastereoisomers</b> (7RS) at the exocyclic amide, the hydrochloric acid hydrolysis of the activated phenolic amide caused epimerisation at the exocyclic position and yielded the acid 7 with the required (7R)-stereochemistry as the major product.|$|E
5000|$|Because HBCD has 16 {{possible}} stereo-isomers {{with different}} biological activities, the substance poses a difficult problem for manufacture and regulation.The HBCD commercial mixture {{is composed of}} three main diastereomers denoted as alpha (α-HBCD), beta (β-HBCD) and gamma (γ-HBCD) with traces of others. A series of four published in vivo mice studies were conducted between several federal and academic institutions to characterize the toxicokinetic profiles of individual HBCD stereoisomers. The predominant diastereomer in the HBCD mixture, γ-HBCD, undergoes rapid hepatic metabolism, fecal and urinary elimination, and biological conversion to other diastereomers with a short biological half-life of 1-4 days. After oral exposure to the γ-HBCD diastereomer, β-HBCD was detected in the liver and brain, and α-HBCD and β-HBCD was detected in the fat and feces [...] with multiple novel metabolites identified - monohydroxy-pentabromocyclododecane, monohydroxy-pentabromocyclododecene, dihydroxy-pentabromocyclododecene, and dihydroxy-pentabromocyclododecadiene. In contrast, α-HBCD is more biologically persistent, resistant to metabolism, bioaccumulates in lipid-rich tissues after a 10-day repeated exposure study, and has a longer biological half-life of up to 21 days; only α-HBCD was detected in the liver, brain, fat and feces with no stereoisomerization to γ-HBCD or β-HBCD and low trace levels of four different hydroxylated metabolites were identified. Developing mice had higher HBCD tissue levels than adult mice after exposure to either α-HBCD or γ-HBCD indicating the potential for increased susceptibility of the developing young to HBCD effects. The reported toxicokinetic differences of individual HBCD <b>diastereoisomers</b> {{have important implications for}} the extrapolation of toxicological studies of the commercial HBCD mixture to the assessment of human risk.|$|E
50|$|Stereochemistry {{also plays}} a role {{assigning}} faces to trigonal molecules such as ketones. A nucleophile in a nucleophilic addition can approach the carbonyl group from two opposite sides or faces. When an achiral nucleophile attacks acetone, both faces are identical and {{there is only one}} reaction product. When the nucleophile attacks butanone, the faces are not identical (enantiotopic) and a racemic product results. When the nucleophile is a chiral molecule <b>diastereoisomers</b> are formed. When one face of a molecule is shielded by substituents or geometric constraints compared to the other face the faces are called diastereotopic. The same rules that determine the stereochemistry of a stereocenter (R or S) also apply when assigning the face of a molecular group. The faces are then called the re-faces and si-faces. In the example displayed on the right, the compound acetophenone is viewed from the re face. Hydride addition as in a reduction process from this side will form the S-enantiomer and attack from the opposite Si face will give the R-enantiomer. However, one should note that adding a chemical group to the prochiral center from the re-face will not always lead to an S stereocenter, as the priority of the chemical group has to be taken into account. That is, the absolute stereochemistry of the product is determined on its own and not by considering which face it was attacked from. In the above-mentioned example, if chloride (Cl-) was added to the prochiral center from the re-face, this would result in an R-enantiomer.|$|E
5000|$|RXPA380 was {{the first}} {{inhibitor}} that was highly selective of the C-domain of ACE, it has the formula Phe-Phe-Pro-Trp. [...] The development of this compound was built on researches that showed that some bradykinin-potentiating peptides showed selectivity for the C-domain and all had several prolines in their structure. These observations lead the researchers to synthesize phosphinic peptides containing a proline residue in the P1’ position and evaluating these compounds led {{to the discovery of}} RXPA380. [...] To study the roles of the residues on RXPA380 the researchers made 7 analogues of RXPA380. All of the compounds made were obtained as a mixture of either 2 or 4 <b>diastereoisomers</b> but all of them were easily resolved and only one of them was potent. This is consistent with the initial modeling studies of RXPA380 which showed that only one diastereomer could accommodate in the active site of germinal ACE. Analogues where pseudo-proline or tryptophan residues had been substituted showed less selectivity than RXPA380. This is probably because these two analogues have more potency toward the N-domain than RXPA380 does. Substituting both of these residues gives great potency but none selectivity. This shows that pseudo-proline and tryptophan residues accommodate well in the C-domain but not in the N-domain. 2 more analogues with both pseudo-proline and tryptophan but missing the pseudo-phenylalanine residue in P1 position showed low potency for N-domain, similar to RXPA380. This supports the significant role of these two residues in the selectivity for C-domain. These two analogues also have less potency for the C-domain which shows that the C-domain prefers pseudo-phenylalanine group in P1 position. Modeling of RXPA380-ACE complex showed that the pseudo-proline residue of the inhibitor was surrounded by amino acids {{similar to that of the}} N-domain thus interactions with S2’ domain might not be responsible for the selectivity of RXPA380. 7 of 12 amino acids surrounding tryptophan are the same in C- and N-domain, the biggest difference is that 2 bulky and hydrophobic amino acids in the C-domain have been replaced with 2 smaller and polar amino acids in the N-domain. This indicates that low potency of RXPA380 for N-domain is not because the S2’ cavity does not accommodate the tryptophan side chain but rather that important interactions are missing between the tryptophan side chain and the amino acids of the C-domain.Also based on the proximity between the tryptophan side chain and Asp1029 there is a possible hydrogen bond between the carboxylate of Asp1029 [...] and the NH indole ring in the C-domain but this interaction is much weaker in the N-domain.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are over}} 150 natural {{products}} that are presumed to undergo a 4+2 Diels-Alder type cycloaddition, belonging to classes such as: polyketides, terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, and alkaloids. [...] The Diels-Alder cycloaddition involves the overlap of the p-orbitals of two unsaturated systems: a 1,3-diene and dienophile. [...] The conjugated diene reacts with the dienophile to form a cyclic product in a concerted fashion. This reaction is widely used in synthesis due to its facile nature and reio- and stereoselectivity under mild conditions. This reaction is very useful for forming carbon-carbon bonds, four-chiral centers, and quaternary stereogenic centers.4,5 Natural {{products that are}} constructed biosynthetically via a Diels-Alder reaction occur both uncatalyzed and catalyzed by enzymes such as Diels-Alderase and RNA Diels-Alderase. [...] In their report of the isolation and structural characterization of the natural product, Lee and co-worker proposed that the biosynthesis of torreyanic acid proceeded via an endo-selective 4+2 cycloaddition with a Diels-Alder dimerization of 2H-pyran monomers 2a and 2b. [...] Key observations that indicate a natural product is biosynthesized via a Diels-Alder reaction include: (a) isolation of an adduct with its corresponding precursor, (b) presence of adducts and their regio- and <b>diastereoisomers,</b> (c) a non-enzymatic feasibility of a likely cycloaddition and (d) chirality of the adducts.The proposed biosynthetic pathway is thought to involve: (a) an electrocyclic ring closure of 3, followed by (b) an enzymatic oxidation to furnish diastereomers 2a and 2b, and finally (c) a 4+2 cyclodimerization to generate torreyanic acid 1. [...] The biosynthesis of torreyanic acid was studied extensively by Poroco et al. {{in their efforts to}} execute the first total synthesis of the natural product. [...] Given that monomer ambuic acid was also isolated from the same endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis microspora, it is further evidence that a Diels-Alder reaction is involved in the biosynthesis of torreyanic acid. [...] The biomimetic synthesis of torreyanic acid involved the rapid conversion of aldehyde 3 to syn- and anti-pyrans 2a and 2b via an oxaelectrocyclization, with the pyrans existising as an equilibrium mixture. Next, a spontaneous Diels-Alder dimerization of 2a and 2b proceeded with complete and regio- and diastereoselectivity to furnish the endo-adduct, torreyanic acid 1. Further, a retro-Diels-Alder reaction carried out at 60 °C proved that torreyanic acid originated from 2a and 2b and ¹H-NMR spectra showed that no aldehyde 3 was observed. The stable transition state in the Diels-Alder reaction (shown with 2a and 2b) has an energy of 9.4kcal/mol, and coupled with the high reactivity of the diastereomers, it is indicated that the Diels-Alder reaction proceeds in a non-enzymatic manner.|$|E
