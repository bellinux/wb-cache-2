40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to {{ascertain}} the viability of spawn produced on cassava peels and used for spawning cassava peels and sawdust substrates and compare the yield with mushroom fruits from the conventional Sorghum bicolor known {{to be the best}} material for spawn production. Three different species of mushroom cultures were inoculated on cassava peels, two Pleurotus pulmonarius strains (FIIRO and Thailand) and Lentinus squarroslus. The study of mycelia colonization rate study was done in triplicate. L. squarroslus completed colonization within 18 days of inoculation in test tube with a growth mean value of 11. 16 cm, the two strains of P. pulmonarius (FIIRO and Thailand) completed colonization in 21 days with FIIRO strain having growth mean value of 11. 46 cm and Thailand strain 11. 20 cm.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Eight fungal and one {{bacterial}} contaminants from naturally contaminated spawn of {{oyster mushroom}} were isolated and identified. These were Aspergillus ffavus var. cotumneris, A. niger, Alternaria alternata, Penicillium janthinellum, Penicillium spp., Rhizopus stotoniter, Trichoderma harzianum, T. viride and Bacillus brevis. Month-wise variation in spawn contaminations caused by various {{fungal and bacterial}} contaminants was observed. The contamination was the highest during the monsoon season (28. 57 %) followed by pre-monsoon (21. 90 %). Type of substrates {{was found to have}} influence on <b>spawn</b> contamination. Paddy <b>grain</b> based <b>spawn</b> recorded significantly lowest (15. 00 %) contamination as compared to wheat grain based (30. 00 %) spawn. Key words: Spawn, oyster mushroom Contamination of cereal <b>grain</b> based <b>spawn</b> caused by various mycoparasites has been constantly reported from many countries (Bitner, 1971; Biserka, 1972 and Suman and Jandaik, 1992). As a result, spawn manufacturers usually lose 15 - 20 % spawn due to spoilage caused by different contaminants (Suman and Jandaik, 1992; Ahlawat et al., 1999). Hence the spoilage of spawn due to some fungal and bacterial contaminants is considered {{to be one of the}} biggest constraints faced by the spawn producing laboratories. Considering the importance of this aspect the present study was undertaken to determine the type and extent of contamination of mushroom spawn bags and also to find out the effect of different factors affecting their incidence...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} dry matter yield, grain yield and yield {{components}} of ecotype 2388 of Vicia narbonensis L. using three seeding rates and {{three levels of}} phosphorus. The experiment was conducted during two crop years 2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011 in the Agricultural Technology Institute located in the semi arid region of Setif in Algeria. The experimental design adopted was a complete randomized block with three repetitions. Phosphorus levels used are 60, 80 and 120 kg ha - 1 and seeding rates are 40, 60 and 80 seeds m 2. Analysis of variance indicates that the dry matter yield, grain yield and agronomic traits were significantly affected by the density and phosphorus levels. Using the rate of 120 kg ha - 1 of phosphorus results in average yields very important of dry matter of about 45. 61 qx ha - 1, grain yield of 15. 60 qx ha - 1, plants highest of 60. 84 cm and a length of pods best of 5. 19 cm. Density of 80 m 2 <b>grains</b> has <b>spawned</b> better <b>grain</b> yields of 15. 48 and 47. 62 qx ha - 1 of dry matter.

Significant positive correlations were observed between grain yield and plant height (r = 0. 825) and dry matter yield (r = 0. 715) and negatively correlated with the number of grains per pod (r = - 0. 654, p< 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) {{is a disease}} of small-grain cereals that has a proven {{negative}} impact on crop yield, quality and food safety. In this regard, {{it is one of}} the most studied diseases of small-grain cereals worldwide. This paper reports the commonly used artificial sources of inoculum and inoculation techniques employed in the study of FHB epidemiology. Spore suspensions and <b>grain</b> <b>spawn</b> are the most popular forms of artificial inoculums. Spray inoculation technique is more commonly used than the point inoculation technique for delivering the inocula to the target sites. Spray inoculation has an advantage over point inoculation in that it can be used to detect both Type I and II resistances to FHB, point inoculation can only detect Type II resistance to FHB. <b>Grain</b> <b>spawn</b> is the commonest soil-surface inoculum used in the study of FHB. Its advantage lies in the fact that it is capable of propagating inoculum over a long period of time compared to other methods. It can also detect the five types of resistances reported (Types I, II, III, IV and V). In order to gain further information regarding the epidemiology of FHB, researchers need to explore other potential sources of artificial inoculum...|$|E
40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB), which is principally caused in the U. S. by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe [telemorph: Gibberella zeae Schw. (Petch) ], is a devastating disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Horderum vulgare L.). Losses inflicted by this disease {{are the result}} of {{reductions}} in grain yield and test weight, as well as the contamination of grain with the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON). In the first study, the objective was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to FHB traits in the resistant line IL 97 - 1828. Resistance to FHB in IL 97 - 1828 is independent of the well characterized and widely used Asian sources. A population consisting of 242 wheat recombinant inbred lines (RILs), developed from a cross between IL 97 - 1828 and the FHB susceptible line Clark, were evaluated for FHB resistance in the field at Urbana, IL in 2009 and 2010, and at Wooster, OH in 2010. The population had broad continuous distributions for all measured disease parameters (incidence, severity, FHB index, Fusarium damage kernels (FDK) percentage, DON concentration, and ISK index, which is a disease index that incorporates disease incidence, severity, and % FDK. Significantly less disease incidence was observed in 2009 than at both locations in 2010, and significantly lower FDK percentage was observed in Ohio compared to Urbana in 2010. Correlations among environments for disease measurements, while significant, were moderate to moderately weak (0. 20 < r < 0. 54). Within an environment, disease measurements were also significantly correlated in all cases. QTL for resistance to FHB were identified on seven linkage groups that mapped to six different chromosomes. In all cases, QTL were minor explaining between 2. 9 % and 8. 7 % of the phenotypic variance. No QTL were consistently identified across all three environments, and three of the detected QTL were only identified in a single environment for a single trait. A region on chromosome 1 B was the only region identified for Type I resistance. A QTL detected on chromosome 2 B was significant for severity, FHB index, FDK percentage, and ISK index, and explained 8. 7 % of the phenotypic variance for the mean of ISK index averaged over environments. The region on 2 B was also identified for reduction in DON concentration in both years in Urbana, IL. A QTL on the long arm of chromosome 3 B was identified for severity, FHB index, FDK percentage, and ISK index, explaining the most phenotypic variance for ISK index at Urbana in 2009 (R 2 = 7. 72 %). Previous reports have identified QTL for FHB resistance in similar genomic regions as those identified in this study. The results of this study indicate several regions contributing small effects are important for resistance to FHB in IL 97 - 1828. 	In the second study, two different inoculation methods for the evaluation of FHB resistance were compared. In one method, the spray and bag method, a bag was placed over wheat heads for 24 h that had been inoculated using a conidia suspension. The second method, a <b>grain</b> <b>spawn</b> method, was used in which F. graminearum infested maize kernels were disseminated, and irrigation was used to provide favorable disease conditions. The latter is a widely used and accepted method, which served as the standard with which the spray and bag method was compared. Plots for the spray and bag method were evaluated for incidence, severity, and FHB index at a single location in Illinois in 2008, and at two locations (Urbana and Brownstown) in Illinois in 2010. Plots inoculated with <b>grain</b> <b>spawn</b> were evaluated at a single location for both years for disease incidence, severity, FHB index, FDK percentage, and ISK index. A subset of plots in 2010 were inoculated using only a conidia spray to evaluate the effect on FHB measurements of placing a bag over inoculated heads. Spearman correlation coefficients in 2008 for entry means were significant (0. 0018 < P < 0. 0001) between the two methods in all cases with coefficients ranging from 0. 41 (incidence) to 0. 83 (severity). In 2010, correlations were not as strong and ranged between 0. 22 (incidence) and 0. 54 (FHB index) for the two location mean of the spray and bag method and the <b>grain</b> <b>spawn</b> method. Incidence was extremely high in 2010, especially in Brownstown (97. 6 %), possibly contributing to the weaker correlations between methods. High disease pressure can potentially overwhelm resistance, making all lines appear susceptible regardless of resistance level. Plots spray-inoculated without a bag correlated poorly with the <b>grain</b> <b>spawn</b> method, possibly due to disease escape. Bagging of inoculated heads appears ideal in order to provide high relative humidity for disease development, similar to irrigation in the <b>grain</b> <b>spawn</b> method. Decreasing the inoculum concentration and possibly the duration of bagging would potentially better separate breeding lines for FHB symptoms, especially incidence. Additionally, it could possibly improve correlations between methods. The results from this study indicate the spray and bag method could be used to screen advanced wheat breeding lines for FHB resistance...|$|E

The cooled substrate was then mixed with <b>grain</b> <b>spawn</b> and filled in perforated polythene bags (60 x 45 cm). Spawning was done by ‘layer spawning method ’ @ 100 g/ 500 g (dry wt.) of the substrate. After spawning, {{the mouth of the}} polythene bag was closed securely using a rubber band.

40|$|When {{assessing}} a streambed for spawning suitability {{it is best}} {{to survey}} the channel during flows similar to those occurring during spawning periods. The expected flows will allow surveys of the stream bed’s actual <b>grain</b> constituents during <b>spawning.</b> A survey of a channel bed during a time of higher or lower flows than expected during spawning periods will result in larger or finer grain sediment than would occur during spawning periods. Fine sediment infiltrates the gravel and can be detrimental to spawning habitat. Fine sediment reduces intragravel water flow, reducing dissolved oxygen required for egg and alevin (underyearling parr or fingerlings) survival. Streambed substrate may be evaluated to assess spawning suitability and to predict survival-to-emergence of salmon/steelhead eggs and alevins (Vick & Pedersen, 2000). A standpipe may be used to measure permeability by driving it into the substrate to a certain depth (about 1 foot), and the use of a pump (Fig. 1). The standpipe is driven into the gravel column until the perforations reach the desired sampling depth. Intra-gravel water enters the pipe through the holes and rises to the level equal to the outside water surface. A graduated suction apparatus maintains a 2. 5 cm pressure head...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of the button mushroom Agaricus bisporus with mycelium-colonized alginate pellets as an inoculant of the growing medium was investigated. Pellets having an irregular surface and porous internal structure were prepared by complexing a mixture of 1 % sodium alginate, 2 to 6 % vermiculite, 2 % hygramer, and various concentrations of Nutrisoy (soy protein) with calcium chloride. The porous structure allowed the pellets to be formed septically and then inoculated and colonized with the fungus following sterilization. By using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to estimate fungal biomass, the matrix components of the pellet {{were found to be}} of no nutritive value to A. bisporus. Pellets amended with Nutrisoy at a concentration of 0. 5 to 8 % supported extensive mycelial growth, as determined by significantly increased ELISA values, with a concentration of 4 % being optimal and higher concentrations proving inhibitory. The addition of hydrated, mycelium-invaded pellets to the compost or casing layer supported the thorough colonization of the growing substrate and culminated in the formation of mushrooms that showed normal development and typical morphology. Yields and sizes of mushrooms were comparable from composts seeded with either colonized pellets or cereal <b>grain</b> <b>spawn.</b> Similarly, amending the casing layer with pelletized-mycelium-colonized compost resulted in a 2 - to 3 -day-earlier and more-synchronous emergence of mushrooms than with untreated casing.
