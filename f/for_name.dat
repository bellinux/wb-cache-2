5|$|To be an {{automatic}} process, the effect should, for each specific person, be fairly stable over time. Koole, Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg investigated this by asking Dutch students to rate each {{letter of the}} alphabet, together with some filler questions for distraction, twice within a four-week period. They found that preferences <b>for</b> <b>name</b> letters did not significantly change {{between the first and}} second rating. Hoorens and colleagues also found that ratings remained stable when 164 subjects rated letters seven days in a row.|$|E
5|$|Across {{languages}} and letters, the average {{probability of a}} letter being chosen {{as one of the}} six preferred letters was 0.30 <b>for</b> <b>name</b> letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies the effect was present but not to a significant degree. The effect was also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered. There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter effect was still found across all languages.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{geographical}} name changes {{occurred in the}} eastern provinces {{of the country and}} on the coast of the eastern Black Sea, where minority populations tend to live. Through independent study, etymologist Sevan Nisanyan estimates that, of {{the geographical}} location name changes, 4,200 were Greek, 4,000 Kurdish, 3,600 Armenian, 750 Arabic, 400 Assyrian, 300 Georgian, 200 Laz, and 50 others. The official statistics of The Special Commission <b>for</b> <b>Name</b> Change (Ad Degistirme Ihtisas Komisyonu) claim that the total number of villages, towns, cities, and settlements renamed is 12,211. The chart below lists the provinces and the number of villages or towns renamed.|$|E

5|$|The Special Commission <b>for</b> <b>Name</b> Change (Ad Değiştirme İhtisas Komisyonu) {{was created}} under the {{supervision}} of the Ministry of the Interior. It brought together professors, politicians, generals, linguists, and academicians throughout Turkey to take up the task of official name changing. Among the commission's participants were members of the Office of the General Staff, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Education, and history and geography professors from Ankara University. The initiative proved successful, as approximately 28,000 topographic names were changed, including 12,211 village and town names and 4,000 mountain, river, and other topographic names. This figure also included names of streets, monuments, quarters, neighborhoods, and other components that make up certain municipalities.|$|E

Under Mir's direction, Gilani went to Philadelphia and legally changed his name to David Coleman Headley, taking his mother's surname. Even though Pennsylvania law requires a background check <b>for</b> <b>name</b> changes, state officials apparently did not uncover Headley's previous drug convictions. The name change would make it easier for Headley to hide his Pakistani ancestry and pass as a Westerner, leading anyone he encountered to assume he was a tourist.|$|E

500|$|In medicine, {{consciousness}} is examined using {{a set of}} procedures known as neuropsychological assessment.

[...] If so, the next {{question is whether the}} patient can respond in a meaningful way to questions and commands. [...] If so, the patient is asked <b>for</b> <b>name,</b> current location, and current day and time.

To conform with copyright laws, the names of many of the rides and roller coasters were changed. The Looney Tunes Boomtown kids area was renamed Kidsworks. The Hurricane Harbor water park area was renamed Hurricane Hannah's Waterpark. The marine life side was shut down immediately before opening. The animals were retained by Six Flags and relocated to other parks such as Six Flags Marine World and Wild Safari. While most of the marine area was razed, the amusement park area attractions and rides remained the same except <b>for</b> <b>name</b> changes.|$|E
