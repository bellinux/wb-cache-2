25|$|Australia's 11 {{million square}} {{kilometre}} <b>fishing</b> <b>zone</b> {{is the third}} {{largest in the world}} and allows for easy access to seafood which significantly influences Australian cuisine. Clean ocean environments produce high quality seafoods. Lobster, prawns, tuna, salmon and abalone are the main ocean species harvested commercially, while aquaculture produces more than 60 species for consumption, including oysters, salmonoids, southern bluefin tuna, mussels, prawns, barramundi, yellowtail kingfish, and freshwater finifish. While inland river and lake systems are relatively sparse, they nevertheless provide some unique fresh water game fish and crustacea suitable for dining. Fishing and aquaculture constitute Australia's fifth most valuable agricultural industry after wool, beef, wheat and dairy.|$|E

At Scott Reef, on 25 May, Gayundah boarded and detained two Dutch schooners with illegal catches of trepang (sea cucumber) and trochus shell, and escorted them into Broome on 29 May. She remained at Broome until mid-July so the ship's officers could appear as witnesses in the resulting court case against the masters of the schooners. For this cruise, the 6-inch bow gun was removed to provide greater bunkering for coal and thereby increase the ship's range.|$|E

500|$|Along {{with the}} spottail shark, the Australian blacktip shark {{is one of}} the most {{economically}} important sharks off northern Australia. It was historically fished for its meat and fins by a Taiwanese gillnet fishery, which began operating off northern Australia in 1974. The annual catch initially averaged around 25,000 tons (live weight), with approximately 70% consisting of Australian blacktip sharks, spottail sharks, and longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol). Following the establishment of the Australian <b>Fishing</b> <b>Zone</b> (AFZ) in November 1979, the Australian government progressively excluded Taiwanese gillnet vessels from large portions of Australian waters and imposed fishing quotas. The fishery eventually became uneconomical when Australia restricted gillnet lengths to [...] in May 1986, and Taiwanese vessels ceased fishing in Australian waters that year. At end of the fishery, Australian blacktip shark numbers were estimated to have been diminished by around 50%. Given its relatively high reproductive rate, its population has likely since recovered.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} stock-effort {{dynamical}} {{model of a}} fishery subdivided into <b>fishing</b> <b>zones.</b> The stock corresponds to a fish population moving between these zones, on which they are harvested by fishing fleets. We consider a linear chain of identical <b>fishing</b> <b>zones.</b> <b>Fish</b> movements between the zones, as well as vessels displacements, are assumed to take place at a faster time scale than the variation of the stock and the change of the fleet size. The vessels movements between the fishing areas {{are assumed to be}} stock dependent, i. e. the larger the stock density is in a zone the more vessels tends to remain in it. We take advantage of these two time scales to derive a reduced model governing the dynamics of the total harvested stock and the total fishing effort. Under some assumption, we obtain either a stable equilibrium or a stable limit cycle which involves large cyclic variations of the total fish stock and fishing effort. We show that there exists an optimal number of <b>fishing</b> <b>zones</b> that maximizes the total catch at equilibrium.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a stock-effort dynamical {{model of a}} fishery subdivided on several <b>fishing</b> <b>zones.</b> The stock corresponds to a fish population moving between different zones, on which they are harvested by fishing fleets. The bio-economical model {{is a set of}} ODE's governing the fishing efforts and the stocks on the different <b>fishing</b> <b>zones.</b> We take profit from the existence of two time scales (a fast one for fish migration and fleets movements, and a slow one for fish growth and mortality and fleets revenue) to construct a reduced (aggregated) model. The aggregated model describes the global evolution of the harvested stock as well as the total fishing effort. The mathematical analysis of the model allows the optimization of the spatial distribution of the fishing effort and the identification of an efficient set of management measures, which corresponds in one hand to set an appropriate system of tax and/or subsidies, {{and on the other hand}} to control the displacement of the fleets between the <b>fishing</b> <b>zones,</b> in order to increase the total activity.

This study examines technical efficiency in the Victorian Abalone Fishery with an input-oriented data envelopment analysis (DEA) using panel data for the period from 1978 / 79 to 2009 / 2010. The influence of factors affecting technical efficiency is analysed using a Tobit regression model of DEA-derived scores. Such factors include inputs (such as number of fishers, time spent fishing), dummy variables for <b>fishing</b> <b>zones,</b> and a time trend.

40|$|What are {{the effects}} of no-take marine {{reserves}} on trophic relationships of coral reef fish? Previous studies often have lacked detailed dietary information on major predators, and have often been confounded by differences in habitat complexity between reserve and fished sites. This study investigates {{the effects of}} marine reserve protection on predator-prey interactions of coral reef fish on the inshore islands of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The abundance of species of prey fish of Plectropomus leopardus (Serranidae), a piscivore and the major target of the hook and line fisheries on the GBR, were estimated in protected and <b>fished</b> <b>zones.</b> These prey species were identified from previous detailed studies of the diet of P. leopardus. Fish populations and habitat characteristics were surveyed by underwater visual census. Previous studies had determined that the biomass of P. leopardus was 3 – 4 times higher in protected than <b>fished</b> <b>zones</b> in the Whitsunday and Palm Islands, central GBR, after 14 years of protection. Eight of the nine prey species had a higher density within <b>fished</b> <b>zones</b> than protected zones, six significantly so. The density of all prey fish was twice that in the fished than the protected zone (p < 0. 001). There {{were no significant differences}} in availability of different sized refuge holes, structural complexity or live coral cover between zones. Thus, important attributes of habitat complexity did not confound the comparisons between reserve and <b>fished</b> <b>zones.</b> Finally, a significant negative correlation (r = 0. 46) between coral trout biomass and summed prey fish biomass suggested that predation may be an important structuring process in this system. The results have implications for the conservation of fishery targets and their prey. The study highlights the potential ecosystem implications of the use of no-take marine reserves as conservation and fisheries management tools...|$|R
