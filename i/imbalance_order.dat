40|$|The {{behavior}} of <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> {{and its impact}} on market performance at the two Taiwan stock index futures markets, the TAIFEX and the SGX-DT, is investigated. The TAIFEX is an order-driven call market, while the SGX-DT uses a quote-driven continuous trading system. Our empirical results show that for the TAIFEX order-driven market, the spread is minimized when <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> is high. In contrast, for the SGX-DT quote-driven market, the spread is highest when <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> is high. For both markets, <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> has an impact on market liquidity and volatility. The impact is larger and more significant for SGX-DT futures.

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether {{the direction and}} magnitude of the aggregate order-imbalance of the index stocks can explain the arbitrage spread between index futures and the underlying cash index. The data are for the Asian financial crisis period and hence entail wide variations in <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> and the index-futures basis.

The {{results indicate that the}} arbitrage spread is positively related to the aggregate <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> in the underlying index stocks; negative order-imbalance has a stronger impact than positive <b>order</b> <b>imbalance.</b> Violations of the upper no-arbitrage bound are related to positive <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> and violations of the lower no-arbitrage bound are related to negative <b>order</b> <b>imbalance.</b> Asymmetric response times to negative and positive spreads {{can be attributed to the}} difficulty, cost, and risk of short stock arbitrage when the futures is below its no-arbitrage value.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{high-frequency}} propagation of shocks across international equity markets. We identify shocks to stock prices, liquidity (quoted and effective spreads), and trading activity (turnover and <b>order</b> <b>imbalance)</b> for 12 equity markets {{around the world}} based on non-parametric jump statistics at the 5 -minute frequency from 1996 to 2011. Jumps in prices, quoted spreads, and <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> are prevalent and large, while jumps in effective spreads and turnover are rare. Within a market, jumps in prices are regularly accompanied by jumps in <b>order</b> <b>imbalance,</b> but are independent of jumps in liquidity. Jumps in prices and co-jumps in prices and <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> are primarily driven by information rather than liquidity, {{since there is no}} subsequent price reversal and since they often occur around U. S. macroeconomic news announcements. We also present evidence that jumps in prices and <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> (but not liquidity) spillover across markets within the same 5 -minute interval. Overall, we find that <b>order</b> <b>imbalances</b> help explain why shocks to stock prices occur and spread across markets, while shocks to liquidity tend to be isolated events...|$|R

40|$|This study uses {{transaction}} {{records of}} index futures and index stocks, with bid/ask price quotes, {{to examine the}} impact of stock market <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> on the dynamic behavior of index futures and cash index prices. Spurious correlation in the index is purged by using an estimate of the "true" indexwith highly synchronous and active quotes of individual stocks. A smooth transition autoregressive error correction model is used to describe the non-linear dynamics of the index and futures prices. <b>Order</b> <b>imbalance</b> in the cash stock market is found to affect significantly the error correction dynamics of index and futures prices. <b>Order</b> <b>imbalance</b> impedes error correction particularly when the market impact of <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> works against the error correction force of the cash index, explaining why real potential arbitrage opportunities may persist over time. Incorporating <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> in the framework significantly improves its explanatory power. The findings indicate that a stock market microstructure that allows a quick resolution of <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> promotes dynamic arbitrage efficiency between futures and underlying stocks.

The proposed market depth measure is applied to transaction specific futures data from Euronext. Subsequently, we examine CBOT traders' perceptions about the price path due to <b>order</b> <b>imbalances</b> and examine the characteristics that are associated with a particular perception.

Traders have various perceptions about the price path due to <b>order</b> <b>imbalances.</b> Dominant perceptions were, S-shape, linear, exponential or zigzag price paths.

We use Lee and Ready (1991) trade assignment algorithm on the cleaned data to distinguish buyer-initiated and seller-initiated trades. And we arrive at <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> measure by taking the difference on buyer-initiated and seller initiated trades. We compute <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> for each minute and for each stock. We then remove those <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> data that overlaps with any news announcements.

The <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> was calculated using the number of quotes for buy and sell and matched with the trades. These figures were then plotted on high resolution graphs using Gnuplot. To identify possible locations where there are no overlaps of with news items, the data for whole days and in some instances for the whole period were plotted on very high resolution graphs at 8000 x 4800 pixels and visualized using an optiportal. Given the volatality of the market during the period of data provided, it was hard to identify a large number of samples that met our criteria. Once the periods were identified, graphs were generated for a two hour window (one hour before and one hour after) around the time under study. This was made easy by a generalized program that was given the stock in concern, the date and time as parameters. Utilizing these graphs it was easy to visualize the changes on a normal PC, the effect of <b>order</b> <b>imbalance</b> on the movement of price. The combination of the use of very high resolution graphs over the whole period on larger optiportals enabled us to see the bigger picture and easily identify the scenarios which would have otherwise taken other complicated analysis and programming to achieve.
