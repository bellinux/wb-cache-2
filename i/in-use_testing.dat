40|$|<b>In-use</b> <b>testing</b> with Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) has {{received}} attention by {{policy makers and}} industry as an effective and cost-efficient means to verify emissions {{of a wide range}} of vehicles. We provide an overview of the state-of-the-art PEMS in-use emissions testing in the current and future European emissions legislation for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles as well as non-road mobile machinery. For obtaining type approval in European Union (EU), light-duty vehicles have to comply with Euro 6 emission standards from January 2014 onward. In parallel, a new test procedure will complement standard emissions testing in the laboratory to control gaseous and particulate emissions over a wide range of real-world driving conditions. Two candidate procedures are developed at present, i. e., random cycle testing and on-road emissions testing with PEMS. Currently, key challenges are the definition of test conditions and design of a suitable method for data evaluation. For heavy-duty vehicles, <b>in-use</b> <b>testing</b> with PEMS is already enforced in the European Union since 2009. The revision of European requirements will be completed in 2014 and shifts the focus from engine conformity checking towards the assessment of emissions under real-world driving conditions. The feasibility of PEMS for measuring particle mass is currently investigated by an industry-run pilot program. Moreover, the application of PEMS to Stage IV and V engines of non-road mobile machinery is currently under discussion. We conclude that <b>in-use</b> <b>testing</b> with PEMS will play an important role in the future European vehicle emissions legislation. The application of PEMS can effectively control vehicle emissions, may accelerate the adoption of novel emission abatement technologies and thereby contribute to air quality improvements throughout Europe.

The Clinical Research Associates (CRA) suspension method was developed to fill this need. It consists of adding 0. 5 ml of a standard culture to 5. 0 ml of test disinfectant and sampling the mixture after 10 min for surviving bacteria. When this test was compared with the AOAC use-dilution method under a simulated use situation, the two methods were generally equivalent in identifying disinfectant inactivation.

Materials and Methods: Seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of Salmonella typhi and Candida albicans. Reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. A very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. Daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to <b>in-use</b> <b>test.</b> Results: The highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by DesNet (5. 05) and Bacillocid special (5. 02).

40|$|In use {{emissions}} testing with Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) {{has become}} one of the key elements of the European emissions legislation. The first ‘official’ step was the publication of the procedures to verify the conformity of gaseous emissions from heavy-duty engines, under the Commission Regulation (EU) 582 / 2011. To adapt these procedures to Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM), a pilot program was launched and will address the specificities for testing and data evaluation. It will also stimulate the dissemination of know-how and the development of good practices. More recently, <b>in-use</b> emissions <b>testing</b> with PEMS became one of the solutions envisaged to control and limit the “real-driving emissions” of passenger cars, as foreseen in the EURO 6 Regulation 715 / 2007, which “requests the Commission to investigate the use of "portable emission measurement systems" (PEMS) and "not-to-exceed" regulatory concepts ( [...] .) and the need to bring real world emissions in line with those measured at type approval. ” This paper will review the progress in the above-mentioned implementation of <b>in-use</b> emissions <b>testing</b> for regulatory purposes.

40|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (CARB) {{agencies}} are implementing {{a series of}} regulations that will control emissions, including oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), from diesel engines during “in-use” conditions. The purpose is to ensure the emission standards can be maintained {{throughout the course of}} the engine’s useful lifetime. One of the most important regulations with respect to controlling in-use emissions is the Not-To-Exceed (NTE) regulation. This regulation sets limits for pollutants that are emitted during operation in a defined portion of the engine map and specifies the protocols required to make those measurements. Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) are critical for the implementation of these in-use regulations. The EPA, CARB, and the Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA) formed a measurement allowance steering committee (MASC) to develop a “measurement allowance” to account for measurement error {{associated with the use of}} PEMS for in-use measurements. A comprehensive program was completed for the gas-phase measurement allowance (Miller et al., 2008; Buckingham et al. 2007; Fiest et al. 2007). This report presents the results of the in-use validation portion of the PM measurement allowance program. The MASC approach pursued an experimental program to try to use laboratory measurements and modeling to characterize errors that might be observed with in-use, and then validate those errors with <b>in-use</b> <b>testing.</b> The development of the MA involved a sophisticated Monte Carlo model that considered laboratory measurement errors associated with engine broadcast information, emissions measurements, affects due to ambient conditions, and affects that might be observed due to on-vehicle operating conditions. The in-use validation effort used the same PEMS systems used for the laboratory testing, but under real-world conditions. The idea was that the errors found in-use should be within the bounds of the proposed MA. For this program, comparisons were made between the PM PEMS and UCR’s Mobile Emissions Laboratory (MEL) reference laboratory under in-use on-road driving conditions. The MEL is unique in that it contains a full 1065 compliant constant volume sampling (CVS) system with gravimetric PM measurements, while being fully operational under on-the-road driving conditions. Two PEMS manufacturers were selected for the in-use validation testing, and multiple serial numbers of each of the selected PEMS were included in the <b>in-use</b> <b>testing.</b> Measurements were made from one class 8 heavy-duty diesel vehicle equipped with a original equipment manufacturer (OEM) diesel particulate filter (DPF). A bypass system was designed to simulate a failed DPF while maintaining the functionality of the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC). The bypass was designed to target an in-use bsPM emission level of 25 mg/hp-h. In-use routes were designed and utilized to exercise the PM PEMS equipment over a range of environmental conditions, and included segments near sea level, in coastal regions, in desert regions, and longer uphill incline segments and segments at elevations up to 4500 ft. Prior to validation testing, the MEL underwent a series of 1065 audits and a cross laboratory correlation with SwRI. All PM PEMS and PM instruments tested showed a negative bias compared to the reference system. The PEMS 2 non-regeneration mean bias at the 20 mg/hp-h bsPM emissions was - 10 mg/hp-h, and at 30 mg/hp-h the mean bias was - 18 mg/hp-h. When the intercept was forced through zero, the mean bias at 20 mg/hp-h went to - 15 mg/hp-h. The PEMS 3 non-regeneration mean bias at the 20 mg/hp-h bsPM emissions was - 1. 7 mg/hp-h, and at 30 mg/hp-h the mean bias was - 2. 2 mg/hp-h. When the intercept was forced through zero, the PEMS 3 mean bias went to - 1 mg/hp-h at the 20 mg/hp-h level. The other instruments used showed a higher mean bias than PEMS 3 and lower mean bias than PEMS 2. The proposed bsPM MA is 6 mg/hp-h at the 20 mg/hp-h in-use standard. For these results, the PEMS 3 system was within the proposed MA, while the PEMS 2 values exceeded the proposed MA. Several issues were discovered during testing, including problems related to testing under in-use conditions, operational issues, and post processing issues. The in-use issues ranged from electrical and mechanical connections, crystal usage from short NTE’s, valve switching, measurement signals, and crystal behaviors. Operational problems occurred during startup, commissioning, and with the systems prior to testing in-use. Typical issues include incorrect system configurations, procedures that don’t work, and issues with the startup software and other recommended practices that didn’t function according to the manual. The post processing issues ranged from data filtering, bsPM differences between processor versions, data identification, and method calculations not being available. In general, PEMS 2 had more issues than PEMS 3 for each of these categories...|$|E
40|$|Regulatory {{agencies}} {{are in the}} process of implementing an <b>in-use</b> <b>testing</b> program for heavy-duty diesel vehicles that will include testing with portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS) under in-use driving conditions. An important aspect of this regulation is the Measurement Allowance program where EPA, CARB, and the Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA) are working together to systematically evaluate various sources of error for gaseous and PM measurements with PEMS in comparison with laboratory measurements. This error is then accounted for in the regulatory standards as a “Measurement Allowance”. A comprehensive program has already been conducted for the gas-phase measurement allowance, with the PM measurement allowance program about to begin. The main objective of this work was to provide preliminary measurements from PM PEMS to assess the accuracy of PM measurements under in-use conditions and provide a basis for the development of the more comprehensive Measurement Allowance program. The MASC utilized the University of California, Riverside (UCR) Bourns College of Engineering – Center for Environmental Research and Technology’s (CE-CERT) Mobile Emissions Laboratory (MEL) to perform the initial in-use PM PEMS evaluation. For this program, PM PEMS were directly compared with the MEL over a series of different on-road driving conditions. Prior to the on-road testing, MEL underwent a 40 CFR Part 1065 self-audit focused on PM sampling. In-use measurements were made from a class 8 truck whose in-use PM emissions levels averaged 0. 043 g/hp-h, which is near the 0. 03 g/hp-h in-use threshold level. The goal was to test a vehicle at or slightly above the Not-To-Exceed (NTE) threshold to investigate sources of error for the PM instruments at levels where their performance is most critical. The on-road driving courses included segments near sea level, in coastal regions, in desert regions, and on longer uphill inclines. PM measurements in real-time were made with a variety of different PM instruments from manufacturers preparing for the PM Measurement Allowance program, as well as other commercially available instruments such as a Dekati DMM and TSI Dustrak. These measurements were directly compared with gravimetric PM mass measurements that were collected with the MEL under 1065 compliant sampling conditions. Measurements were made under conditions where NTE events would be expected (e. g., uphill driving segments) and for varying durations to provide a range of mass loadings. Comparisons of the performance of the instruments and PM mass measurements from 0. 02 to 0. 1 g/hp-h are be presented. The results of this study are expected to be an important component of PM Measurement Allowance program development...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom CampusThe {{human race}} {{has had to}} endure a variety of {{disabling}} and life threatening diseases which include leprosy, plaque, Black Death and numerous other infamous viruses, none of which awaken terror like the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). HIV infection has produced {{one of the most}} dreaded epidemics of the twentieth century, or rather, of all time, leaving no country or race untouched. Until this time, no cure for this disease has been discovered, and sufferers have to tolerate the frustrating adverse effects of the numerous Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs that have to be taken in order to live an average life. Whilst combination antiretroviral therapy has proven to be the most effective approach in treating HIV positive patients, Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) therapy seem to assure better patient adherence. An oral liquid dosage formulation is desired for paediatric HIV patients, and for those who cannot swallow other oral dosage forms such as capsules and tablets. The focus {{of this study was to}} combine lamivudine, zidovudine and nevirapine into a powder for oral suspension, and to identify incompatibilities and other factors that could possible affect the physical arid chemical stability of the formulation. Formulations were designed according to the UNICEF/WHO (2004) dosage suggestions. The first step in the product development was an investigative literature study into the stability and possible interactions between the three active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and excipients. Compatibility was confirmed by means of DSC and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) -studies. The optimal mixing time for the powders for suspension was determined before formulation of the bulk formulae began. Six suspension formulations according to patient mass were formulated containing the dosage regime for one month as suggested by WHO. Sodium propyl hydroxybenzoate and sodium methyl hydroxybenzoate were added as preservatives. The physical and chemical stability of pharmaceutical substances do play a vital role in the success of a specific product. Stability tests, physical and chemical. and preservative efficacy studies were therefore performed on all six formulations over a period of twelve weeks, at three temperature conditions, namely 25 oC+ 60 %RH, 30 °+ 65 %RH and 40 °C+ 75 %RH. In that period, in-use stability testing, to ensure the stability during patient use, was also conducted. Results obtained for pH, relative density, viscosity and moisture content indicated that no significant changes took place during the accelerated stability testing. as well as the in-use test period. 'There was a change in the physical appearance, especially the colour, with time at the 3 O 0 C+ 6 S%RH and 40 °C+ 75 %RH storage conditions, as well as during <b>in-use</b> <b>testing</b> after 12 weeks. Dissolution results showed that larnivudine, zidovudine and nevirapine were immediately dissolved, with 100 % dissolution after 10 minutes. The assay results for lamivudine, zidovudine and nevirapine remained within the specification of 90 - 110 %, but a downward trend in lamivudine assay was observed in the 300 ml and 900 ml formulation, where a result of 89. 3 % was measured after 12 weeks at 40 oC+ 75 %RH. Results for sodium methyl hydroxybenzoate were all within the 90 - 110 % limit. Results higher than the upper limit of 110 % were calculated for sodium propyl hydroxybenzoate in some samples. This could be due to integration inconsistencies during assay due to the very mall peak. Preservative Efficacy Test (PET) results were all within the USP 28 specifications, even during in-use studies, and confirmed the effectiveness of the preservative system. In conclusion it can be said that lamivudine, zidovudine and nevirapine were successfully combined in a FDC for use in paediatric, adult and geriatric AIDS patients. The powder for suspension formulations have definite marketing possibilities and could become an essential part in the fight against AIDS. Master...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate a possible link between antibiotic resistant gastrointestinal pathogens and reduced susceptibility to anti microbial agents found in commonly used household disinfectants. Tetracycline and ofloxacin resistant and sensitive Salmonella and E. coli species were isolated from fresh poultry and clinical samples. Ethidium bromide accumulation assays were performed to assess the presence of active efflux pumps. Using spectrophotometric accumulation assays, the extrusion of the active components of commercial household agents by the efflux pumps was tested. To determine changes in the efficacy of these products, <b>in-use</b> disinfectant <b>testing</b> was performed. Active efflux pumps and extrusion of the active ingredients was observed in the resistant but not in the sensitive organisms. When the household products were used at the recommended concentrations, a significant reduction of both resistant and sensitive bacteria was observed after the <b>in-use</b> disinfectant <b>testing</b> procedure. However, if the household products were used at concentrations below the recommended concentration, the resistant bacteria were not eliminated as efficiently as the sensitive bacteria...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} study developed a methodology to perform mandatory dynamometer vehicular emissions tests on real roads, performed on-road emissions tests, and compared {{the test results}} to the estimates using the current EPA emissions estimation model. Currently, mandatory vehicular exhaust emission tests are performed on chassis or engine dynamometers using the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) /Supplemental Federal Test Procedure (SFTP) drive schedules. Based on the developed real-world <b>in-use</b> emissions <b>testing</b> methodology with using a modified test vehicle, authors could follow the FTP/SFTP drive schedules while the vehicle was driven on real roads, and measure emissions during the in-use on-road FTP/SFTP emissions testing. Emissions from the vehicle during the testing were measured, analyzed, and compared to estimated emissions using the current EPA emissions estimation model, MOtor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES). The authors observed discrepancies between the measured data and the MOVES estimates, especially when associated with cold-start emissions...|$|R
40|$|In 1987 TNO Automotive {{started the}} {{execution}} of a large scale in-use compliance program for passenger cars. The initial goal of the program was: 'Monitoring the emission performance of passenger cars in-use and relating this performance to the situation at type approval'. In the early years the program proved to be very useful for detection of emission reduction technology not performing up to the type approval specifications, while in use. With increasing performance and reliability of passenger car technology, the number of failing cars decreased significantly, only diesel cars still show some problems. Over the years, the program {{has proved to be}} a very important data source for determining emissions of the Dutch national car fleet. The Dutch national emission modeling is based on data from the in-use compliance program. Especially emission data gathered on real world test cycles prove to be of increasing importance. Because of changes in the European emission regulations (Euro III), new fields of <b>in-use</b> compliance <b>testing</b> have to be addressed.

40|$|The <b>in-use</b> {{emissions}} <b>testing</b> industry, {{academic research}} and the emission abatement technology development sector have all been pushing for smaller, lighter, lower cost and, ever more importantly, lower energy consumption portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS). While there is an obvious and understandable natural tension here for the more established PEMS technology manufacturers, it is worth both acknowledging this and considering the routes and barriers for such a next generation system. As {{part of this process}} we need to consider a number of questions, e. g. Do we really need a smaller PEMS? What emissions do we need it to measure? What are the design bottlenecks for reducing the footprints of the different PEMS components? What are the hidden challenges for anyone delivering a next generation PEMS? And, with the recent VW emissions scandal in mind, how can we make best use of small/light/low cost PEMS as part of our on-going research, assessment and regulatory activities? Using examples from recent work and the literature, the intention here is to consider one of these questions in some detail: namely, the instrumental design bottlenecks and associated analytical challenges of downsizing gaseous, particulate and flow measurement systems...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2007 SAE International Diesel {{equipment}} owners often desire {{knowledge of}} the direct feasibility and impacts of different technologies, retrofits, or fuels on their fleet under their specific operating conditions. This is now possible {{with the advent of}} portable emissions measurement systems and other in-use measurement technologies. The SAE J 1321 Fuel Economy Test and Title 40 CFR 1065 <b>in-use</b> emissions <b>testing</b> procedures were adapted for use in an off-road mining haul truck environment over long time periods. Fuel consumption was directly measured using coriolis mass flow meters on two pairs of test and control trucks. Gaseous emissions were also measured with a Horiba OBS- 2200 portable emissions measurement system. Testing was completed under steady state loads analogous to laboratory dynamometer modal tests and during normal in-use operations for 12 hour test periods with real-time emissions and fuel consumption data obtained. Fuel consumption and nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and total hydrocarbon emissions correlated well with typical levels and the manufacturer’s certifications for this engine family. Analysts also compared engine control module fuel consumption data to coriolis meter fuel consumption data, and found reasonable agreement at high power settings. The in-use data also allowed evaluation of fuel consumption and emissions profiles over entire vehicle duty cycles. This provides indicators to help train operators and plan mine layouts to minimize driving conditions where high emissions or fuel consumption occur...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Background: In {{this study}} {{antimicrobial}} effectiveness test {{was performed on}} eye-drops which had high microbial contaminations in hospital practice {{to find out whether}} their antimicrobial efficacies affect the magnitude of microbial contamination during their uses. Materials and Methods: Artificial tear, atropine sulfate, betamethasone, homatropine hydrobromide, phenylephrine hydrochloride, phenylephrine zinc, pilocarpine hydrochloride, tetracaine hydrochloride and tropicamide eye-drops were subjected to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and British Pharmacopeia (BP) antimicrobial preservative effectiveness tests. Results: The results of this study showed that eight out of the nine products met the BP 'B' and USP criteria. The preservative employed in phenylephrine zinc eye-drop did not possess adequate antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa. Other eye-drops showed appropriate reductions in bacterial viability after 6 hrs, 24 hrs and 7 days, but showed a very low bacterial recovery after 28 days which didn't comply with the no recovery (NR) term of BP 'A' criteria. Since viable microbial counts were usually determined by plate count method, it seems that the term of NR should define an acceptable range. Conclusion: The results indicated {{that there is not a}} clear correlation between antimicrobial efficacy testing of eye-drops and the rate of their microbial contamination while are being used. Other factors such as hygienic practices of eye-drops, proper bottle design and training of patients could influence their microbial contaminations. Regulation of <b>in-use</b> efficacy <b>testing</b> of eye-drops which is influenced by the environment, the frequency and technique of use, might be essentia...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, <b>In-Use</b> Compliance <b>testing</b> {{is closely}} related to {{homologation}} legislation, as in most cases the IUC test is a derivative from the type approval test. As it is the aim of this paper to explore the future of IUC testing, this can be studied best on the basis of expectations for future homologation test procedures that also include vehicles with advanced powertrains. Within the framework of an European project, research has been carried out by TNO Automotive and other research institutes, aimed at the development of adequate measurement methods and test procedures for the evaluation of energy use and emissions of such vehicles. A number of the identified problems that may occur when vehicles with advanced powertrains are tested by current homologation procedures, are discussed in this paper to indicate the nature, size and impact they have on these procedures. Though absolute solutions for these problems are not available at this moment yet, it is already possible to sketch the consequences they will bring for future homologation legislation. Based on these findings, an outlook to the future of IUC testing is drawn. One of the major conclusions concerns {{the fact that it is}} an absolute requirement for test cycles to become representative for real-life conditions, a quality that is absent in most current test cycles. TNO Automotive has gained a lot of experience in this field. Therefore, special attention is given here to their view of how representativity can be ensured best in a test cycle...|$|R
40|$|The Euro VI Regulation (EC) No 595 / 2009 and the {{implementing}} Regulation [2] (EC) 582 / 2011 {{introduces a}} procedure for PEMS testing as a mandatory {{part of the}} type approval legislation in order to check the conformity of heavy-duty engines with the applicable emissions certification standards during the normal life of those engines: this is the so-called “In Service Conformity” (ISC) requirements. In addition, Euro VI engines also have to verify their actual in-use emissions already at type approval (PEMS demonstration test). Even if the PEMS procedure has already been introduced into legislation {{there is still a}} need for further evaluation and development. Article 14 (3) of the implementing regulation for Euro VI (EC) No 582 / 2011 states the following: “Any additional requirements with respect to off-cycle <b>in-use</b> vehicle <b>testing</b> referred to in point (d) of paragraph 1 shall be introduced after the assessment of the PEMS procedures set out in Annex II. The assessment shall be finalised by 31 December 2014. ” An assessment of the currently introduced PEMS procedure should therefore be carried out, and based on the outcome of this assessment; proposals for amending the PEMS procedure should be made. The European Commission through DG ENTR in co-operation with DG JRC launched in January 2012 a programme to address the legislative mandate to assess the present PEMS procedure. This report describes the activities during the programme, its findings and recommendations for amending the PEMS procedure. JRC. F. 8 -Sustainable Transpor...|$|R
