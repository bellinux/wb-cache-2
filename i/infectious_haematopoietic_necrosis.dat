40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to use sentinel fish to determine whether fallowing would effectively reduce the <b>Infectious</b> <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> (IHN) load around sites in an area where every mariculture site had a history of IHN. The approach involved re-introducing fish to a few strategically placed (sentinel) sites and monitoring them for the presence of the virus over a specified period. Eighteen site visits and 217 viral plaque assays were carried out. No IHN virus was detected in the morts collected during the site visits, nor were there any positive reports from the passive surveillance system. Blood samples collected at the end of the grow-out period, indicated that the fish from one of tha sites had antibodies to IHN virus at the tome of harvest. <b>Infectious</b> <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus was detected on this site ten months after fish were transferred to the site...|$|E

50|$|RNA-based {{methods are}} limited by the {{relative}} fragility of the viral RNA. Prolonged fixation in Davidsons' fixative might result in RNA degradation due to fixative-induced acid hydrolysis.

Rapid diagnostic tests using MAbs are now in common use for white spot syndrome virus and are being marketed under the commercial name of Shrimple. Similar tests for TSV, yellowhead virus and <b>infectious</b> hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus are currently under development.|$|R
50|$|During the 20th century, L. vannamei was an {{important}} species for Mexican inshore fishermen, {{as well as for}} trawlers further offshore. In the late 20th century, the wild fishery was overtaken by the use of aquaculture; this began in 1973 in Florida using prawns captured in Panama. In Latin America, the culture of L. vannamei showed peaks of production during the warm El Niño years, and reduced production during the cooler La Niña years, due to the effects of disease. Production of L. vannamei is limited by its susceptibility to various diseases, including white spot syndrome, Taura syndrome, <b>infectious</b> hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis,</b> baculoviral midgut gland necrosis and Vibrio infections. By 2004, global production of L. vannamei approached 1,116,000 t, and exceeded that of Penaeus monodon.|$|R
40|$|Transcription {{in vitro}} by the RNA {{polymerase}} of <b>infectious</b> <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHNV), a salmonid rhabdovirus, was investigated using different reaction conditions to maximize RNA synthesis. The use of HEPES buffer rather than Tris buffer, {{and the addition}} of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the reactions resulted in a sixfold increase in RNA synthetic activity to 6400 pmol UMP incorporated/mg viral protein/hour. The RNA transcripts produced in this system contained polyadenylated species which co-migrated with IHNV mRNA species 2, 3, 4 and 5 from IHNVinfected cells. The transcripts were shown to be functional mRNA species by their ability to direct the synthesis of viral proteins in vitro. <b>Infectious</b> <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHNV) is a rhabdovirus which infects salmon and trout and causes great economic losses in fish hatcheries in western North America (Pilcher & Fryer, 1978). The virion protein structure {{is similar to that of}} rabies virus (Hill et al., 1975; McAllister & Wagner, 1975) and IHNV also encodes one non-virion (NV) protein (Kurath & Leong, 1985).

40|$|Plaque assays for salmonid virus, Oncorhynchus masou virus (OMV), were {{examined}} and compared with <b>infectious</b> <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHNV) and {{infectious pancreatic necrosis}} virus (IPNV), combining various fish cell-lines and three overlays. OMV produced the plaques only in chinook salmon embryo (CHSE- 214) cells and rainbow trout gonad (RTG- 2) cells, irrespective of overlays used, but plaque formation of IHNV and IPNV differed in different cell-lines according to the overlays used. The plaquing procedure using CHSE- 214 cells gave a ten-fold higher number of plaques than RTG- 2 cells. Among three overlays of methylcellulose, gum tragacanth, and agarose, methylcellulose overlay facilitated OMV plaque formation, and the plaques were most clearcut and easily enumerated. On the whole, the combination of methylcellulose overlay and CHSE- 214 cell-line was the most suitable for plaque assay of OMV as well as IHNV and IPNV...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{preliminary}} survey of parasitic and <b>infectious</b> hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHHNV) infections in giant freshwater prawn from the Damak Sea of Rejang River, Kuching, Sarawak was conducted. Symptoms of black spots/patches on the rostrum, carapace, pleopods or telson {{were observed in}} most of the 107 samples collected. Parasitic examination revealed sessiline peritrichs such as (Zoothamnium sp.), nematode larvae, gregarine stage and cocoon of leech with prevalences of 1. 2 %, 1. 2 %, 5 % and 17 % respectively. Under histopathological examination, changes like accumulation of hemocytes around hepatopancreatic tubules due to vibriosis, basophilic intranuclear inclusions in the epithelium and E-cell of hepatopancreatic tubules as a result of HPV were seen through the section. No positive infection of IHHNV was detected in 78 samples. As such, the wild giant freshwater prawns in Damak Sea of Rejang River in Kuching are IHHNV-free though infections of parvo-like virus and bacteria were seen in histopathology...|$|R
40|$|<b>Infectious</b> hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> (IHHN) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} viral diseases of cultured penaeid shrimps and is potentially a limiting factor in the development of farming projects for some species of these shrimps. Although the IHHN agent was recognized early as being viral in origin, attempts to characterize it were inconclusive because of difficult-ies in obtaining sufficient amounts of purified virions to permit its characterization. Recent improvements of purification procedures have allowed the physico-chemical characterization of this virus. Purified IHHNV is a non-enveloped icosahedral particle aver-aging 22 nm in diameter, exhibiting a mean buoyant density of 1. 40 g/ml in CsCI. The genome is a single molecule of ssDNA with an estimated size of 4. 1 kb by molecule length measurement i transmission electron microscopy.

40|$|The prawn viruses White Spot Syndrome Virus {{and yellow}} head virus have been {{detected}} in frozen commodity prawns. However, no studies on the occurrence of two other Office International des Epizooties-listed viruses, Taura Syndrome virus (TSV) or <b>infectious</b> hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHHNV), have been published. Therefore, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study on whether these two viruses {{could be found in}} frozen commodity prawns imported into Australia was undertaken. Amplicons indicative of TSV were found in 6 / 10 prawns collected at a retail outlet in Townsville and 10 / 10 prawns from Coff's Harbour using two different reverse transcriptase PCR protocols. Nucleotide sequences from the amplicons were between 97 % and 99 % similar to various TSV isolates from Asia. Amplicons indicative of the Philippine/American lineage of IHHNV were found in 5 / 5 and 5 / 6 prawns collected from Townsville and Coff's Harbour respectively.

40|$|Swiss {{aquaculture}} farms {{were assessed}} {{according to their}} risk of acquiring or spreading viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) and <b>infectious</b> <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> (IHN). Risk factors for the introduction and spread of VHS and IHN were defined and assessed using published data and expert opinions. Among the 357 aquaculture farms identified in Switzerland, 49. 3 % were categorised as high risk, 49. 0 % as medium risk and 1. 7 % as low risk. According to the new Directive 2006 / 88 /EC for aquaculture of the European Union, the frequency of farm inspections must be derived from their risk levels. A sensitivity analysis showed that water supply and fish movements were highly influential on {{the output of the}} risk assessment regarding the introduction of VHS and IHN.

40|$|<b>Infectious</b> hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHHNV) {{has been}} {{detected}} widely in penaeid culture facilities in Asia and the Americas. IHHNV infection on sub-adult and postlarvae {{of the giant}} freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii which had caused up to 80 % mortalities was first reported in Southeast Taiwan in 2006. In Malaysia, although, {{there has been no}} report on IHHNV infections in M. rosenbergii, preliminary work suggests that there is an urgent need to setup a screening protocol for IHHNV for both wild and cultured populations. In this study, polymerase chain reaction based screening was carried out on 30 randomly sampled berried wild M. rosenbergii before and after spawning. All samples did not showed any sign of IHHNV infection. However, the results showed that 20 % of the samples were IHHNV positive. Sequence analysis of the amplified band using NCBI-BLAST showed that the putative IHHNV sequence had 98 % nucleotide sequence (388 bp) identity with the IHHNV isolate AC- 05 - 005 non-structural protein 1 gene and seven other IHHNV strains in the data bank further affirming the suggestion on the presence of IHHNV in wild freshwater prawn populations in Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|Nine {{endogenous}} Brevidensovirus-like elements (EBreVE) {{were identified}} in redclaw freshwater crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus from different sources suggesting that these elements are widespread in redclaw in northern Queensland, Australia. These endogenous virus-like elements shared nucleotide identities (70 – 100 %) and amino acid similarities (34 – 100 %) with <b>infectious</b> hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHHNV) scientifically classified as Penaeus stylirostris densovirus (PstDNV). They may not have originated from IHHNV genomes, but could be derived from another uncharacterised member of the genus Brevidensovirus that share nucleotide similarities with IHHNV. The most striking feature of EBreVEs was that in each case, the segment (portion) of viral sequences inserted into the host genomes was from the same region of the viral genome and most likely derived from non-structural protein regions of ancestral virus, but they cannot be assembled into one consensus sequence. The EBreVEs may be inserted into the redclaw genomes following chronic or persistent infection by a corresponding virus that may have occurred as multiple independent integration events years ago leading to the accumulation of several integrated elements in their genomes. Histological examination and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) suggested that these insertions may have a protective function to their host...|$|R
40|$|The {{lack of a}} {{standardised}} {{system for}} the isolation, identification and purification of prawn viruses, is a major obstacle to the control of viruses in penaeid aquaculture. To date, spontaneous and induced transformation of somatic penaeid cells has failed. Hybrid cells {{with the aim of}} supporting the growth of penaeid viruses were created using polyethylene glycol (PEG) -mediated fusion with two immortal cell lines, Epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) and Spodoptera frugiperda pupal ovarian cells (Sf 9), fused with Penaeus monodon haemocytes. The immortal cell lines were biochemically blocked with actinomycin D and puromycin before fusion occurred. A total of 78 hybrid clones were created. The methods used to confirm the presence of P. monodon genes and proteins in the hybrid cells did not detect crustacean components, nor was any viral amplification detected by real-time PCR after hybrid cells were inoculated with two P. monodon parvoviruses, Penaeus merguiensis densovirus and <b>infectious</b> hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus. These results suggest although the creation of the hybrid cells appeared successful, the cell lines lacked key crustacean cell components required for their use as an in vitro system for virus replication...|$|R

While our preparations of the IHN, SVC, SBi and PFD viruses showed typical rhabdovirus morphology with bullet-shaped particles and distinct surface projections, the VHS virus preparations had a less typical rhabdovirus morphology but were pleomorphic with a preponderance of flexuous rods. Using virus labelled with [~H]-uridine, it was shown that each virus contained RNA which sedimented at 38 to 4 ° S and was hydrolysed by very low concentrations of ribonuclease. The viruses of SVC, PFD and SBI had a polypeptide composition {{similar to that of}} vesicular stomatitis virus, the prototype rhabdovirus, but the IHN and VHS viruses gave a pattern similar to that of rabies virus. In serum neutralization tests the SVC and SBI viruses were indistinguishable.

40|$|The fish {{rhabdovirus}} <b>infectious</b> <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHNV) {{contains a}} non-virion (NV) gene between the glycoprotein (G) and polymerase (L) genes on its RNA genome. The present study investigated three other fish rhabdovirus genomes {{and found that}} the NV gene of hirame rhabdovirus is closely related to the NV of IHNV, whereas the viral haemorrhagic septicemia NV gene showed evidence of significant divergence. Most importantly, spring viraemia of carp virus, the only vesiculovirus-like fish rhabdovirus examined, did not have an NV gene at its genomic RNA G–L junction. These results suggest that the presence of an NV gene is characteristic of the unassigned fish rhabdovirus subgroup previously classified as lyssaviruses, and that the NV gene is not essential for replication in fish cells per se, since it is absent in a vesiculovirus-like fish rhabdovirus. Rhabdoviruses are among the most widely distributed viruses in nature, infecting many plant, invertebrate and vertebrate hosts (Wunner & Peters, 1991).

40|$|In {{this study}} we rediscovered and {{verified}} {{the presence of an}} <b>infectious</b> hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHHNV) strain amongst cultured penaeid prawns Penaeus monodon from 1993 in Australia {{on the basis of a}} PCR analysis with IHHNV specific primers and sequencing of the resulting amplicons. A total of 7 previously published diagnostic primers specific to IHHNV were tested against Australian penaeid prawns and only 1 elicited a positive IHHNV PCR result with 16 out of 20 Australian P. monodon samples examined. In comparison, all 7 primers produced IHHNVpositive amplicons from the New Caledonian control samples. Analysis and comparison of the 392 bp fragment derived from the Australian IHHNV strain (AY 590120) with other geographical isolates revealed that the Madagascar isolate shared the highest nucleotide similarity (96. 2 %) and the Hawaiian and New Caledonian strain the highest nucleotide divergence (90. 1 and 90. 3 % respectively). The high nucleotide variation observed between the Australian and Hawaiian strains provides an explanation for the lack of IHHNV detection amongst Australian prawns with published IHHNV PCRs and commercially available gene probes as they are primarily designed on the basis of the Hawaiian strain (AF 218266). Results indicated that IHHNV has been present in Australia for a long (geological and contemporary) time and that the virus is endemic in penaeid prawns in the Australian environment...|$|R
50|$|Selection {{for growth}} in Penaeid shrimps yielded {{successful}} results. A selective breeding program for Litopenaeus stylirostris saw an 18% increase in growth after the fourth generation and 21% growth after the fifth generation. Marsupenaeus japonicas showed a 10.7% increase in growth {{after the first}} generation. Argue et al. (2002) conducted a selective breeding program on the Pacific White Shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei at The Oceanic Institute, Waimanalo, USA from 1995 to 1998. They reported significant responses to selection compared to the unselected control shrimps. After one generation, a 21% increase was observed in growth and 18.4% increase in survival to TSV. The Taura Syndrome Virus (TSV) causes mortalities of 70% or more in shrimps. C.I. Oceanos S.A. in Colombia selected {{the survivors of the}} disease from infected ponds and used them as parents for the next generation. They achieved satisfying results in two or three generations wherein survival rates approached levels before the outbreak of the disease. The resulting heavy losses (up to 90%) caused by <b>Infectious</b> hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHHNV) caused a number of shrimp farming industries started to selectively breed shrimps resistant to this disease. Successful outcomes led to development of Super Shrimp, a selected line of L. stylirostris that is resistant to IHHNV infection. Tang et al. (2000) confirmed this by showing no mortalities in IHHNV- challenged Super Shrimp post larvae and juveniles.|$|R
40|$|Between July 2004 and January 2005, high mortalities (up to 80 - 100 %) were {{frequently}} encountered in postlarvae of Macrobrachium rosenbergii in southern Taiwan. Pathologically, eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies (INIs) were {{found only in}} the hepatopancreatic tubular epithelial cells of the infected postlarvae from hatchery farms. No lesions could be detected in tissue of ectodermal or mesodermal origin. Interestingly, different lesions were found in sub-adults collected from a grow-out farm. Atrophic changes in abdominal muscles from the fourth to sixth segment and tail fan, associated with a reddish discoloration, were prominent features in these shrimp, {{but there was no}} unusual mortality or INI formation. In PCR assays for the detection of <b>infectious</b> hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHHNV), hepatopancreatic parvovirus (HPV), white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), Tanta syndrome virus (TSV), yellowhead virus (YEV), M. rosenbergii nodavirus (MrNV) and extra small virus (XSV), only an expected 389 -bp product, specific for the IHHNV nonstructural protein gene, was obtained from all postlarvae and sub-adults examined. Positive reactions to in situ hybridization, using a DIG-labelled DNA probe, further confirmed IHHNV as the causative agent. In a comparison of our strains with Taiwanese (GenBank accession no.

However, imported white shrimp may carry some infectious agents which pose serious threats on aquatic species native to Thailand. Therefore, {{in the present}} study the import risk analysis (IRA) was conducted to identify any hazard and estimate the risk presented by importation of white shrimp. The process involves the risk analysis steps of hazard identification and characterization, risk assessment and risk management. The risks associated with individual diseases and disease agents of white shrimp have been evaluated. Risk assessment conducted using risk evaluation matrix indicated high risk of Taura syndrome virus (TSV), White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) and <b>Infectious</b> hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHHNV) in imported white shrimp. The iterative process of risk management leads to a set of acceptable measures or strategies for each identified hazard for which the unrestricted risk is considered higher than appropriate level of protection.

A portable device, namely POCKITTM, became available recently to complete fluorescent probe-based insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR), and automatic data detection and interpretation within one hour. Taking advantage of this platform, the IQ PlusTM WSSV Kit with POCKIT system was established to allow simple and easy WSSV detection for on-site users. The assay was first evaluated for its analytical sensitivity and specificity performance. The 95 % limit of detection (LOD) of the assay was 17 copies of WSSV genomic DNA per reaction (95 % confidence interval [CI], 13 to 24 copies per reaction). The established assay has detection sensitivity similar to that of OIE-registered IQ 2000 TM WSSV Detection and Protection System with serial dilutions of WSSV-positive Litopenaeus vannamei DNA.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} the susceptibility {{of three different}} batches of whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei from Mexico to an inoculum of <b>infectious</b> hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHHNV). Each of the three shrimp batches came from a different hatchery. Because of their origin, {{it was possible that}} the genetic makeup of these batches was different among each other. The three batches tested showed differences in IHHNV susceptibility. Here, susceptibility is defined as the capacity of the host to become infected, and it can be measured by the infectivity titer. Susceptibility to IHHNV was observed in decreasing order in shrimp from batch 1 (hatchery from El Rosario, Sinaloa), batch 3 (hatchery from Nayarit) and batch 2 (hatchery from El Walamo, Sinaloa), respectively. The largest susceptibility difference between batches was 5012 times, and that between early and late juveniles from the same batch was 25 times. These results indicate that within a species, susceptibility to a pathogen such as IHHNV can have large differences. Susceptibility to pathogens is an important trait to consider before performing studies on pathogenesis. It may influence virological parameters such as speed of replication, pathogenicity and virus titer. In order to evaluate the potential use of IHHNV as a natural control agent against white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), it is necessary to know host susceptibility and the kinetics of IHHNV infection. These features can help to determine the conditions in which IHHNV could be used as antagonist in a WSSV infection...|$|R
40|$|In British Columbia, Canada, <b>infectious</b> <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHNV) is {{prevalent}} in wild sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka and has caused disease in seawater net-pen reared Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. In this study, chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha experimentally exposed to an isolate of IHNV found in British Columbia became carriers of the virus. When Atlantic salmon were cohabited with these virus-exposed chinook salmon, IHNV was {{isolated from the}} Atlantic salmon. Identification of chinook salmon populations that {{have been exposed to}} IHNV may be difficult, as virus isolation was successful only in fish that were concurrently infected with either Renibacterium salmoninarum or Piscirickettisia salmonis. Also, IHNV-specific antibodies were detected in only 2 of the 70 fish experimentally exposed to the virus. Two samples collected from chinook salmon exposed to IHNV while at a salt water net-pen site had a seroprevalence of 19 and 22 %; however, the inconsistencies between our laboratory and field data suggest that further research is required before we can rely on serological analysis for identifying potential carrier populations. Because of the difficulty in determining the exposure status of populations of chinook salmon, especially if there is no concurrent disease, it may be prudent not to cohabit Atlantic salmon with chinook salmon on a farm if there is any possibility that the latter have been exposed to the virus...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background There are {{currently}} no purification methods {{capable of producing}} the large amounts of fish rhabdoviral glycoprotein G (gpG) required for diagnosis and immunisation purposes or for studying structure and molecular mechanisms of action of this molecule (ie. pH-dependent membrane fusion). As {{a result of the}} unavailability of large amounts of the gpG from viral haemorrhagic septicaemia rhabdovirus (VHSV), {{one of the most dangerous}} viruses affecting cultured salmonid species, research interests in this field are severely hampered. Previous purification methods to obtain recombinant gpG from VHSV in E. coli, yeast and baculovirus grown in insect cells have not produced soluble conformations or acceptable yields. The development of large-scale purification methods for gpGs will also further research into other fish rhabdoviruses, such as <b>infectious</b> <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHNV), spring carp viremia virus (SVCV), hirame rhabdovirus (HIRRV) and snakehead rhabdovirus (SHRV). Findings Here we designed a method to produce milligram amounts of soluble VHSV gpG. Only the transmembrane and carboxy terminal-deleted (amino acid 21 to 465) gpG was efficiently expressed in insect larvae. Recognition of G 21 - 465 by ß-mercaptoethanol-dependent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (N-MAbs) and pH-dependent recognition by sera from VHSV-hyperimmunized or VHSV-infected rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was demonstrated. Conclusions Given that the purified G 21 - 465 conserved some of its most important properties, this method might be suitable for the large-scale production of fish rhabdoviral gpGs for use in diagnosis, fusion and antigenicity studies. </p...|$|E
40|$|Part of the {{functions}} and duties of the European Community Reference Laboratory for Fish Diseases (CRL) is to organise periodic comparative tests of diagnostic procedures at Community level as described in Council Directive 2006 / 88 /EC (Anonymous, 2006), previously outlined in Council Directive 93 / 53 /EEC (Anonymous, 1993). A qualitative and quantitative proficiency test was carried out annually since 1996. These tests were primarily designed to assess the ability of participating laboratories to identify the listed viruses: viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) and <b>infectious</b> <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHNV) on list II in Council Directive 91 / 67 /EEC, annex A (Anonymous, 1991). The tests have typically consisted of five coded ampoules of lyophilised supernatant from infected cell cultures. Participants were asked to identify and quantify the contents within a deadline of 8 weeks. The CRL collated the answers and processed them statistically and graphically to provide the individual laboratory with a unique picture of its performance in relation to the other participants. Each participant was assigned a code number to ensure discretion. Occasionally the test was designed with additional purposes; other common fish viruses were included for differential diagnosis, cell line susceptibility within and between laboratories were tested, and the ability of laboratories to detect double infections and differentiate between genotypes was also part of the test. This paper describes the different approaches in designing the test over a 10 -year period and comments on the overall performance of participants during that period...|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{cultivation}} {{of the black}} tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) started in the 1970 s in Myanmar using trap and hold method. P. monodon postlarvae (PL) were trapped into the ponds measuring approximately 50 to 100 hectares (ha) during high tide. Because these large ponds have no inputs in terms of pond preparation, eradication of predators, water fertilization, and feeding, production volume {{during the early years}} of the shrimp industry in the country provided some lucrative income for the farmers. With this promise, a 3 -year project aimed at developing the shrimp culture systems into extensive, extensive plus and semi-intensive was implemented by the Department of Fisheries (DoF), Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries (MLF) in 2010. Unfortunately, in that same year, an outbreak of white spot disease (WSD) caused by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) occurred in ponds stocked with imported postlarvae and devastated the shrimp industry of the country. Moreover, P. monodon samples from Ayeyarwaddy Division (western part of Myanmar) were also found positive for Taura syndrome virus (TSV) and <b>infectious</b> hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus (IHHNV) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in 2010. In addition, yellow head virus (YHV) was also detected in shrimp samples for export in 2014. Fortunately, acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) has not yet been detected in cultivated shrimps in Myanmar. Because of disease problems, majority of the shrimp farmers have shifted to extensive or traditional shrimp farming. The Aquatic Animal Health and Disease Control Section (AAHDCS) of the DoF formulates the action plans for aquatic animal health and disease control. Thus to keep abreast with the novel techniques used for the detection and management of previously reported and newly emerging diseases of penaeid shrimps, upgrading of laboratory equipment and facilities, and improving the capacity of the departmental personnel on aquatic animal health management are currently being undertaken...|$|R
40|$|MicroRNAs are 20 - 22 nt non protein-coding RNA {{regulatory}} {{genes that}} posttranscriptionally regulate many protein–coding genes to influence critical biological and metabolic processes. While {{the number of}} known microRNA is increasing, there is no published data for microRNA in freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) a commercially cultured and economically important food species. Through deep parallel sequencing and an in silico data analysis approach, 327 miRNA families have been identified from small RNA libraries with reference to both the de novo transcriptome of M. rosenbergii obtained from RNA-Seq and to miRBase (Release 18. 0, November 2011). Based on the identified mature miRNA and recovered precursor sequences that form appropriate hairpin structures, three conserved miRNA (miR 125, miR 750, miR 993) and 27 novel miRNA candidates encoding messenger-like non-coding RNA have been identified. miR- 125, miR- 750, G-m 0002 /H-m 0009, G-m 0005, G-m 0008 /H-m 0016, Gm 0011 / H-m 0027 and G-m 0015 were selected for experimental validation with stemloop quantitative RT-PCR and were found coherent with the expression profile of deep sequencing data as evaluated with Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r = 0. 835178 for miRNA in gill, r = 0. 724131 for miRNA in hepatopancreas). Using a combinatorial approach of pathway enrichment analysis and inverse expression relationship of miRNA and mRNA, four co-expressed novel miRNA candidates (G-m 0005, G-m 0008 /H-m 0016, G-m 0011 /H-m 0027, and G-m 0015) {{were found to be}} associated with energy metabolism. In addition, the expression of the three novel miRNA candidates (G-m 0005, G-m 0008 /H-m 0016, and G-m 0011 /H-m 0027) were also found to be significantly reduced at the 9 and 24 hours post infection in a controlled experiment of M. rosenbergii challenged with <b>infectious</b> hypodermal and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>necrosis</b> virus.
