5|$|Also in 1404, Władysław held {{talks at}} Vratislav with Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia, who offered to return Silesia to Poland if Władysław {{supported}} him <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> struggle within the Holy Roman Empire. Władysław turned the deal {{down with the}} agreement of both Polish and Silesian nobles, unwilling to burden himself with new military commitments in the west.|$|E
5|$|Historian Thomas Vogel opines that Rommel {{was not a}} Nazi, if {{one uses}} the {{definition}} the Nazis themselves used, considering that although he did everything <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> to make his country strong again, he showed no support towards the racial policies or {{other aspects of the}} regime.|$|E
5|$|In Legacy of the Void, {{not long}} after his {{ascension}} to the throne, Korhal {{and the rest of}} the Dominion are assaulted by Moebius Foundation under control of the fallen Xel'Naga, Amon. Alongside Raynor, he does everything <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> to save his people. When Artanis arrives, he aids Raynor and Valerian to repel the Moebius Foundation on Korhal. After Amon has been banished into the Void, Valerian allows Raynor to take the Dominion Fleet to Ulnar in order to help Kerrigan and Artanis to defeat Amon once for all. After Amon's defeat, Valerian has turned the Terran Dominion into a government of peace and prosperity.|$|E

5|$|Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was crowned as the 13thking in the Copán dynasty in July695. He oversaw {{both the}} apogee of Copán's {{achievements}} and {{also one of}} the city's most catastrophic political disasters. During his reign, the sculptural style of the city evolved into the full in-the-round sculpture characteristic of Copán. In AD718, Copán attacked and defeated the unidentified site of Xkuy, recording its burning on an unusual stone cylinder. In AD724 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil installed K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat as a vassal on the throne of Quiriguá. Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was confident enough <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> to rank his city among the four most powerful states in the Maya region, together with Tikal, Calakmul and Palenque, as recorded on StelaA. In contrast to his predecessor, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil concentrated his monuments in the site core of the Copán; his first was StelaJ, dated to AD702 and erected at the eastern entrance to the city.|$|E
5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory if it is <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power?</b> What should he say to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were {{for the sake of}} those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.|$|E

25|$|The {{relation}} of Jupiter to Janus is problematic. Varro defines Jupiter as the god who has potestas (power) over the forces by which anything {{happens in the}} world. Janus, however, has the privilege of being invoked first in rites, since <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power</b> are the beginnings of things (prima), the appearance of Jupiter included.|$|E

25|$|Salieri cannot {{reconcile}} Mozart's boorish behaviour {{with the}} genius that God has inexplicably bestowed upon him.

25|$|Though {{all should}} be {{unanimous}} for setting him at liberty, yet would I cut him to pieces.

25|$|After {{the success}} of Lostwithiel, {{there was little to}} detain Charles's main army in the extreme west. Meanwhile, Banbury, a most {{important}} point in the Oxford circle, and Basing House (near Basingstoke) were in danger of capture. Waller, who had organised a small force of reliable troops, had already sent cavalry into Dorsetshire with the idea of assisting Essex. He now came himself with reinforcements to prevent, so far as lay <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>power,</b> the King's return to the Thames valley.|$|E

He failed and Younghusband had his revenge for White's insubordination when he later left him in the leech-infested jungles of Sikkim to arrange mule and coolie transport to Tibet.|$|E
