50|$|In early 1941, after viewing a {{newsreel}} showing what {{he considered}} amateurish dazzle camouflage on Royal Navy Ships, {{he wrote a letter}} to the US Navy offering his services. At the time, the Navy did not anticipate using disruptive camouflage schemes and declined his offer. In the summer of 1942, after the US had entered World War II, Warner (then age 65) was asked to return to the Navy, to serve as Chief Civilian Aid to Commander Charles Bittinger (his close friend from earlier years) in the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> camouflage. As the techniques for observation had changed in the years since World War I, so too did ship deception needs. While much of World War II American ship camouflage was disruptive and deceptive (rather than directed toward invisibility), its newly restrained, geometric style (akin perhaps to Modern Art) was vastly different from the dazzle designs of the previous war. Among those who worked with Warner in developing the new designs were Bennet Buck, Sheffield Kagy, William Walters, Arthur Conrad and Robert R. Hays.|$|E
5000|$|The UNNS {{operates}} {{two main}} types of ship {{during the period}} in which the first four books are set- the Ship of the Line and the Sloop, again using Napoleonic naval terminology. The former are commanded by Captains while the latter are commanded by Commanders (although custom dictates that the commanding officer of a ship is addressed as [...] "Captain" [...] regardless of his actual rank in all but the most formal situations). Ships of the line typically have three decks while sloops have two, although some larger sloops (e.g. UNS Challenger) have three decks, and are only slightly smaller than ships of the line. Cargo barges are also mentioned, huge in mass and only operated by a skeleton crew. Later in the series a new type of ship, the two deck fastship, is introduced under the command of a Commander. Very lightly armed but also significantly faster than standard ships, fastships are often used as message runners. In the final books, another new <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> is introduced, the Galactic class. These ships are much bigger than any other ship built, with six disks and several thousand passengers and crew.|$|E
30|$|Environmental {{conditions}} in the Arctic are extremely harsh, with low temperatures (down to − 70  °C), ice sheet formation, long periods of darkness, strong winds, and remote locations. Consequently, the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> and offshore structures intended for Arctic service presents significant engineering challenges.|$|R
50|$|The process <b>of</b> <b>shipping</b> {{arms from}} Russia to Spain was {{extremely}} slow. Many shipments were lost or arrived only partially matching {{what had been}} authorized. Stalin ordered shipbuilders to include false decks in the original <b>designs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> and, while at sea, Soviet captains employed deceptive flags and paint schemes to evade detection by the Nationalists.|$|R

It is however from 1519 that their number increases substantially, but gradually. It was an evolution and a gradual improvement in the design made during {{the first quarter of the}} century - technical improvement which continued until the second half of the century. The Portuguese galleon evolved from the square rigged caravel and was a compromise between the great carrack or nau and the aforementioned square rigged caravel or war caravel (also called caravela de armada or Portuguese man of war) that evolved into a new <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship,</b> but keeping its hull design similar to the galley.

40|$|Abstract: Reliable and {{accurate}} {{determination of the}} static and dynamic response quantities is of considerable importance for economical and safe <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> hull structures and oŒshore platforms. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present ecient methodologies that can be employed to obtain reliable nite element solutions for static and dynamic analysis of ship structural components. An a posteriori error estimator and h-adaptive renement strategy is proposed for static and dynamic analysis of stiŒened plate/shell panels. The equal subdivision or bisection method is made use of and local renements are carried out only in the elements requiring renements. An adaptive time-stepping scheme is proposed for transient dynamic analysis of stiŒened plate/shell panels based on the time error estimates. Numerical studies on the static and dynamic analysis of ship hull structural compo-nents have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the error estimator and the adaptive renement strategy. It is observed that the proposed adaptive strategy in association with the error estimator is helpful in arriving at optimal mesh and time steps for the specied accuracy. It is recommended that the proposed methodologies can be used in obtaining reliable nite element solutions for <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> structural components subjected to static and dynamic loads...|$|E

40|$|Objectives] A concept named ‘component {{contribution}} rate’ {{is proposed}} {{to solve problems}} concerning the influence of ship structure components on ship structure performance. [Methods] First, a hierarchical structure is elaborated and mapped from structural components to structural performance. Second, the component contribution rate is defined in order to describe the contribution rate for a component in structural performance to fulfill its structural purpose. Next, the grey target theory is applied to quantify the component contribution rate. [Results] Finally, {{the application of the}} proposed method is demonstrated through a SWATH case study. [Conclusions] This method can be applied in the evaluation of the ship structural schemes,in order to support the optimal <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> structure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} most common causes of failure in ship unloaders. The {{structural}} forms employed in the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> unloaders and {{the characteristics of the}} loads acting on these structures are introduced first. Then, typical failures including overloading, joint failure, cable breaking, corrosion and fatigue failure amongst others, are described. Fatigue failure is discussed in further detail. When assessing a ship unloader for fatigue, it is necessary to define the fatigue demand and the fatigue strength capacity of those structural details under investigation. The latter experiences stress cycles that accumulate over time until reaching a limit that leads to cracking. Loads and stresses need to be monitored to describe those cycles, and critical locations must be checked to prevent a catastrophic failure...|$|E
