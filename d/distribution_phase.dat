However, {{it has been found}} than when administered intravenously in lipid emulsion, better pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution were achieved. [...] The lipid emulsion administration had a higher AUC and lower clearance than the solution form, which meant that there was an increased bioavailability of cinnarizine, allowing for an improved therapeutic effect. [...] Plasma pharmacokinetics of cinnarizine administered intravenously follows a three-compartment model first with a fast <b>distribution</b> <b>phase,</b> followed by a slower <b>distribution</b> <b>phase,</b> and ending with a very slow elimination. [...] The Vss (steady state apparent volume of distribution) for lipid emulsion administration was 2x lower (6.871+/- 1.432 L/kg) than that of cinnarizine given in solution (14.018 +/- 5.598 L/kg) and it was found that significantly less cinnarizine was taken up into the lung and brain in the lipid emulsion condition.

In contrast to intravenous and sublingual administration, the terminal half-life of estradiol is 13 to 20 hours with oral administration. The difference is due to the fact that, upon oral administration, a large hormonally inert pool of estrogen sulfate and glucuronide conjugates with extended terminal half-lives is reversibly formed from estradiol during first-pass metabolism, and this pool serves as a metabolically resistant and long-lasting circulating reservoir for slow reconversion back into estradiol.|$|E

During this phase, the stock price does not change much because these investors are in the minority demanding (absorbing) stock that the market at large is supplying (releasing). Eventually, the market catches on to these astute investors and a rapid price change occurs (phase 2). This occurs when trend followers and other technically oriented investors participate. This phase continues until rampant speculation occurs. At this point, the astute investors begin to distribute their holdings to the market (phase 3).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{origin of}} spliceosomal introns {{is the central}} subject of the introns-early versus introns-late debate. The <b>distribution</b> of intron <b>phases</b> is non-uniform, with an excess of phase- 0 introns. Introns-early {{explains}} this by speculating that a fraction of present-day introns were present between minigenes in the progenote and therefore must lie in phase- 0. In contrast, introns-late predicts that the nonuniformity of intron <b>phase</b> <b>distribution</b> reflects the nonrandomness of intron insertions. Results In this paper, we tested the two theories using analyses of intron <b>phase</b> <b>distribution.</b> We inferred the evolution of intron <b>phase</b> <b>distribution</b> from a dataset of 684 gene orthologs from seven eukaryotes using a maximum likelihood method. We also tested whether the observed intron <b>phase</b> <b>distributions</b> from 10 eukaryotes {{can be explained by}} intron insertions on a genome-wide scale. In contrast to the prediction of introns-early, the inferred evolution of intron <b>phase</b> <b>distribution</b> showed that the proportion of phase- 0 introns increased over evolution. Consistent with introns-late, the observed intron <b>phase</b> <b>distributions</b> matched those predicted by an intron insertion model quite well. Conclusion Our results strongly support the introns-late hypothesis of the origin of spliceosomal introns. </p...|$|R

40|$|A data {{distribution}} scheme of sparse arrays on a distributed memory multicomputer, in general, {{is composed of}} three phases, data partition, {{data distribution}}, and data compression. In the data partition phase, a global sparse array is partitioned into some local sparse arrays. In the data <b>distribution</b> <b>phase,</b> these local sparse arrays are distributed to processors. In the data compression phase, a local sparse array is compressed by some data compression methods {{in order to obtain}} better performance for sparse array operations. To implement the data distribution scheme, methods proposed in the literature first perform the data partition phase, then the data <b>distribution</b> <b>phase,</b> followed by the data compression phase. We called this scheme as Send Followed Compress (SFC) scheme. In this paper, we propose two other data distribution schemes, Compress Followed Send (CFS) and Encoding-Decoding (ED), for sparse array distribution. In the CFS scheme, the data compression phase is performed before the data <b>distribution</b> <b>phase.</b> In the ED scheme, the data compression phase can be divided into two steps, encoding and decoding. The encoding step and the decoding step are performed before and after the data <b>distribution</b> <b>phase,</b> respectively. To evaluate the CFS and the ED schemes, we compare them with the SFC scheme. In theoretical analysis, we analyze the SFC, the CFS, and the ED schemes in terms of the data distribution time and the data compression time. In experimental test, for all test cases, we implemented these schemes on an IBM SP 2 parallel machine. From the experimental results, the CFS and the ED schemes outperform the SFC scheme for all test cases. For the CFS and the ED schemes, the ED scheme outperforms the CFS scheme.
