40|$|We tested autumn frost {{hardiness}} {{in three}} Norway spruce (Picea abies [L. ] Karst.) provenances originating from different altitudes at two trial plots in Slovakia (Vel’ký Lom at 450 m a. s. l., Mútne-Zákamenné at 1, 250 m a. s. l.) in a spinoff experiment of the IUFRO 1964 / 68 Inventory Provenance Experiment with Norway spruce. Two approaches {{were used to}} assess hardiness: the electrolyte-leakage method based on artificial freezing, and meas-urements of chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters. The <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> index at- 20 °C differed between prove-nances, with a significant provenance-by-plot interaction. In material from the lower-altitude Vel’ký Lom trial plot, the high-elevation TANAP provenance exhibited much lower <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> than the middle-elevation Habovka and low-elevation Beòuš provenances. In material from the high-altitude Mútne-Zákamenné trial plot, all three tested provenances showed approximately the same degree of <b>frost</b> <b>injury.</b> At- 80 °C no differences between prove-nances were observed, and the trees growing at the high-elevation site exhibited lower average <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> than the trees at Vel’ký Lom. Most parameters of the kinetics of chlorophyll a fluorescence followed the same trends as <b>frost</b> <b>injury,</b> and differed significantly between plots. We suggest that the observed differences resulted from acclimation of trees to the conditions of the trial plots rather than from adaptation through natural selection...|$|R
40|$|Heterogeneous ice nuclei are necessary, and {{the common}} epiphytic ice {{nucleation}} active (INA) bacteria Pseudomonas syringae van Hall and Erwinia herbicola (Löhnis) Dye are sufficient to incite <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> to sensitive plants at − 5 °C. The ice nucleation activity of the bacteria occurs at the same temperatures at which <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> to sensitive plants occurs in nature. Bacterial ice nucleation on leaves can be detected at about − 2 °C, whereas the leaves themselves, i. e. without INA bacteria, contain nuclei active only at much lower temperatures. The temperature at which injury to plants occurs is predictable {{on the basis of}} the ice nucleation activity of leaf discs, which in turn depends on the number and ice nucleation activity of their resident bacteria. Bacterial isolates which are able to incite injury to corn at − 5 °C are always active as ice nuclei at − 5 °C.

40|$|Several {{different}} silvicultural treatments {{were studied}} in two experiments. In the first, mechanical scarification, slash removal, vegetation control, clear-cut age and seedling types were investigated {{with respect to}} <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> to Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) seedlings. Frost damage was also related to near-ground minimum temperature. In the other experiment, the effects of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris (L.)) shelterwood density gradients, ranging from dense, uncut forest to complete clear-cuttings, were analysed. Near-ground temperature and radiation were monitored close to planted Norway spruce cuttings with a mobile data acquisition system. Growth, frost damage and chlorophyll fluorescence were monitored and analysed in relation to microclimate. Budburst date was estimated and the nocturnal near-ground temperature during the period when the seedlings were most susceptible to frost was analysed in both experiments. The shelterwood moderated near-ground radiation fluxes and diurnal temperature varia-tions, while the daily mean temperature was unaffected. Near-ground minimum tempera-tures were lower, and vertical temperature inversions were more pronounced in clear-cuttings than in shelterwoods, during clear and calm nights. The effects were most pro-nounced during a dry period. Budburst was delayed in the shelterwood. Later budburst was shown {{to reduce the risk}} of exposure to frosts during the most frost-susceptible period, when cuttings of two clones, differing in budburst date, were compared. Mechanical scarification reduced frost damage to seedlings in the first growing season, but neither herbicide treatment, nor mowing affected the frequency of <b>frost</b> <b>injury.</b> The frequency of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> was higher amongst containerised seedlings than amongst bare-rooted seedlings, especially in the first growing season. Neither clear-cut age nor slash removal affected the frequency of <b>frost</b> damage. <b>Frost</b> <b>injury</b> to the cuttings was reduced by the shelterwoods, since 80 % were damaged by frost in clear-cuts and low-density shelterwoods, 27 % in moderately dense shelterwoods, and only 5 % in dense shelter-woods. Of the climatic variables tested, the accumulated net and global radiation the day after a severe frost event were the most strongly correlated with the degree of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> among cuttings, and the variation in their Fv/Fm ratios, in the graduated shelterwoods. <b>Frost</b> <b>injuries</b> were rarely lethal, but reduced growth and increased the proportion of seed-lings with multiple leaders and spike knots, especially amongst seedlings that were re-peatedly injured over several years. Height growth was lower in the clear-cut area than in moderately dense shelterwoods during years with severe frost dam...|$|R

40|$|Four Solanum tuberosum L. cultivars (Nicola, Pito, Puikula, Timo) {{and somatic}} hybrids between {{freezing}} tolerant S. commersonii and freezing sensitive S. tuberosum were evaluated for their tolerance to freezing and low temperature photoinhibition. Cellular freezing tolerance was studied using ion leakage tests and {{the sensitivity of}} the photosynthetic apparatus to freezing and high light intensity stress by measuring changes in chlorophyll fluorescence (FV/FM) and oxygen evolution. Exposure to high light intensities after freezing stress increased <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> significantly in all genotypes studied. Compared with S. tuberosum cultivars, the hybrids were more tolerant both of freezing and intense light stresses. In field experiments the mechanism of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> varied according to the severity of night frosts. During night frosts in 1999, the temperature inside the potato canopy was significantly higher than at ground level, and did not fall below the lethal temperature for potato cultivars (from - 2. 5 to - 3. 0 °C). As a result, <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> developed slowly, indicating that damage occurred to the photosynthetic apparatus. However, as the temperature at ground level and inside the canopy fell below - 4 °C, cellular freezing occurred and the canopy was rapidly destroyed. This suggests that in the field visual frost damage can follow from freezing or non-freezing temperatures accompanied with high light intensity. Therefore, in an attempt to improve low temperature tolerance in potato, it is important to increase tolerance to both freezing and chilling stresses...|$|R

40|$|Not {{every cell}} {{of a given}} {{bacterial}} isolate that has ice-nucleating properties can serve as an ice nucleus {{at any given time}} and temperature. The ratio between the number of ice nuclei and number of bacterial cells in a culture (i. e. nucleation frequency) was found to vary with incubation temperature, growth medium composition, culture age, and genotype. Optimal conditions for ice nucleus production in vitro included incubation of the bacterial cells at 20 to 24 °C on nutrient agar containing glycerol. The relationship between nucleation frequency and <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> was examined by subjecting corn seedlings to − 4 °C immediately after they were sprayed with bacterial suspensions with different nucleation frequencies and by following both ice nucleus concentration and bacterial population size on leaves of corn seedlings as a function of time after bacterial application. The amount of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> to growth chamber-grown corn seedlings at − 4 °C was a function of the number of ice nuclei active at that temperature on the leaves. The number of ice nuclei, in turn, is the product of the nucleation frequency and population size of ice-nucleation-active bacteria present on the leaves...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Spring {{frost damage}} to pears in the Pacific Northwest {{frequently}} results in substantial crop losses. This research was undertaken {{to investigate the}} effects of frost on pear buds, flowers, and fruit through controlled freezing tests and field studies {{in order to better}} understand the frost phenomenon and refine frost protection decisions. Controlled freezing studies on 'Bartlett' pear (Pyrus communis L.) showed that the percent of florets injured by frost increased with decreasing temperature, advancing developmental stage, and increasing duration at minimum temperatures of - 2, - 3, and - 4 ° C. Increases in injury occurred with exposures of 30 or 60 minutes at all stages except the small fruit stage, in which injury continued to increase for 2 hours at - 2 ° C. No significant effects of freezing rate were found at - 2, - 3, or - 4 ° C. However, there was a significant effect of freezing rate at - 5 ° C. No hardiness differences were found between comparable floral developmental stages from weak and vigorous trees. Bloom delay through evaporative cooling resulted in a loss of hardiness beyond that found earlier in the season on non-misted trees for similar stages of development. However, under field conditions a certain amount of frost protection was gained through bloom delay. Simulated <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> to small fruit ovaries at intervals after full bloom significantly-increased fruit malformation, reduced fruit weight, and increased fruit drop of 'Bartlett', 'Bosc', and 'Comice' pear trees. Time of injury did not affect fruit weight and malformation in most cases, but early injury did significantly increase fruit drop. Significant positive correlations were found between fruit weight and seed content, while negative correlations were found between fruit malformation and seed content for all cultivars. Crop density was correlated significantly with sum of percent floral <b>injury</b> from <b>frost,</b> orchard design, and height in the tree for 'Bartlett', 'Bosc', and 'Anjou' pear. Regression models for crop density, regressed on sum of the percent injury, orchard design, and height in the tree differed between cultivars indicating that one model cannot be used to estimate crop density at harvest for all cultivars. Crop density was greater at low levels of <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> in free standing than in hedgerow trees, and at greater elevations in the trees. Data suggest that 30 percent <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> in hedgerow and 60 percent <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> in free standing pear orchards are reasonable injury levels to accept without incurring crop losses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{tropical}} high Andes experience greater daily temperature oscillations {{compared to}} seasonal ones {{as well as}} a high frequency of night frost occur-rence year round. Survival of organisms, under such environmental conditions, has been determined by selective forces which have evolved into adaptations including avoidance or tolerance to freezing. These adaptations have been studied in diVerent species of trees, shrubs and perennial herbs in páramo ecosys-tems, while they have not been considered in grasses, an important family of the páramo. In order to under-stand survival of Poaceae, resistance mechanisms were determined. The study was performed along an altitu-dinal gradient (2, 500 – 4, 200 m a. s. l.) in the páramo. Supercooling capacity and <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> temperature were determined in nine species in order to establish cold resistance mechanisms. Grasses registered a very low supercooling capacity along the altitudinal gradi-ent, with ice formation between ¡ 6 and ¡ 3 °C. On the other hand, <b>frost</b> <b>injury</b> temperature oscillated between ¡ 18 and ¡ 7 °C. Our results suggest that grasses exhibit freezing tolerance as their main cold resistance mecha-nism. Since grasses grow at ground level, where greatest heat loss takes place, tolerance may be related to this life form as reported for other small life forms...|$|R
