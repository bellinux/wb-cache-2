We've grafted a dollar whenever we saw one that had a surplus look to it. But we never went after the simoleon in the toe of the sock under the loose brick {{in the corner of}} the kitchen hearth. There's an old saying you may have heard --'fussily decency averni'--which means it's an easy slide from the street faker's dry goods box to a desk in Wall Street. We've took that slide, but we didn't know exactly what was at the bottom of it. Now, you ought to be wise, but you ain't. You've got New York wiseness, which means that you judge a man by the outside of his clothes. That ain't right. You ought to look at the lining and seams and the button-holes.

However little is known about their emissions and to what extent they contribute to indoor air pollution. The French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (Afsset) conducted tests in order to characterize VOCs emissions from 32 consumer products: air fresheners, glass cleaners, <b>furniture</b> <b>polishes,</b> toilet products, carpet and floor cleaning products. All experiments were conducted by the Scientific and Technical Centre for Building (CSTB) in realistic conditions of use (in emission test chamber or in an experimental house). Results show that the use of consumer products can lead to high indoor VOCs concentrations. Some of them are toxic airborne contaminants. The link between formaldehyde emissions and product compositions is discussed. Finally, formaldehyde concentrations are compared to the indoor air quality guideline value proposed by Afsse...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the project is to investigate the effects of cleaning products on upholstery leather finishes. Focusing on products applicable to upholstery leather cleaning, non-typical leather cleaners (and possible contaminants) or ink removers, {{in order to find}} out their behaviour, understanding how they work and if they are suitable for their purpose. Moreover an initial investigation about mechanism of soiling is proposed, in order, in the future, to avoid the soiling or develop an anti-soiling system making an improvement on the durability and maintainability in the leather types and producing an increase of the leather quality. The work reported in this document discusses the cleaning products used to clean upholstery leather finishes. The products examined range from leather cleaners, non-typical leather cleaners such as washing up liquids, <b>furniture</b> <b>polishes,</b> leather dressings, etc. Possible contaminants e. g. hair spray and finally ink removers. As a section of the project, an initial trial examining the mechanism of soiling of upholstery leather surfaces was carried out.
