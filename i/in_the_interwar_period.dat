5|$|First Polish sport {{organizations}} have been founded in the 1890s. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period</b> there was a plethora of organizations of all types in all Central European countries, the Zaolzie region wasn’t exception. Sport clubs there were often multi-sport, associating several sport branches, mostly football, athletics, volleyball, table tennis etc.|$|E
5|$|After {{the early}} 20th century, few fortifications {{were built in}} Malta. However, new {{military}} installations such as airfields began {{to be built in}} World War I, when the seaplane base of RAF Kalafrana and the airfield at Marsa were built. More airfields were built <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period</b> and the Second World War, including RAF Hal Far, RAF Ta Kali, RAF Luqa, RAF Safi, RAF Krendi and Ta' Lambert Airfield.|$|E
5|$|Derived {{from early}} Slavic flag-like objects, a royal banner of arms dates {{as far back}} as the 11th century CE. A symbol of royal authority, it was used at coronations and in battles. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period,</b> it was {{replaced}} with the Banner of the Republic of Poland, which was part of the presidential insignia. A national banner is not mentioned in the current (2007) regulations on Polish national symbols, although today's presidential jack is based directly on the pre-war design for the Banner of the Republic.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> early <b>interwar</b> <b>period</b> Biddle {{continued}} his studies in far-flung locations such as Tahiti, returned to France in 1924, and in 1928 {{went on a}} sketching trip through Mexico with Diego Rivera.|$|R
50|$|Olympique de Marseille {{was already}} active in women's {{football}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s, {{making it one}} of the few active women's teams that took part in its original incarnation <b>in</b> pioneering <b>the</b> game <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interwars</b> <b>period.</b> <b>The</b> team disappeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s along with the other women's teams of the time, but it was reactivated when French women's football competitions returned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s and from 1975 it took part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> French championship, which later became the current national league. In 1979 it reached the championship's semifinals, but in 1983 it was relegated and three years later it disappeared.|$|R
5|$|There {{were two}} exceptions: Turkey's Yavuz Sultan Selim and the Royal Navy's Hood. The Turkish Navy made only minor {{improvements}} to the ship <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period,</b> which primarily focused on repairing wartime damage and the installation of new fire control systems and anti-aircraft batteries. Hood was in constant service with the fleet {{and could not be}} withdrawn for an extended reconstruction. She received minor improvements {{over the course of the}} 1930s, including modern fire control systems, increased numbers of anti-aircraft guns, and in March 1941, radar.|$|E
5|$|All four ships {{served with}} the main fleet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period,</b> where they were {{primarily}} occupied with training exercises and fleet reviews. During the Spanish Civil War, Gorizia evacuated Italian nationals and Pola took part in non-intervention patrols. All four ships supported the Italian invasion of Albania in April 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II. After Italy joined the wider conflict in 1940, the four ships saw extensive action in the Mediterranean Sea against British forces. The ships {{took part in the}} battles of Calabria and Cape Matapan, and in the latter engagement, Zara, Pola, and Fiume were all sunk in a ferocious night action with three British battleships.|$|E
5|$|American {{emergency}} rations in World War I {{consisted of}} a quarter ounce (7 grams) packet of double-strength instant coffee, packed one per man in containers with multiple types of foods meant for twenty-four men. Instant coffee was also used in reserve rations and trench rations. During World War II, the U.S. military again relied on Washington, but this time {{on an equal footing}} with the other major instant coffee brands that had emerged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period,</b> most notably Nescafé, as well as the new companies formed to meet a renewed military demand.|$|E
50|$|During the 19th and 20th centuries, many Italians from Western Austria-Hungary settled <b>in</b> Transylvania. During <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period,</b> some Italians {{settled in}} Dobruja.|$|R
50|$|Gaston Durville (1887-1971) was a French {{physician}} who, {{with his}} brother, André Durville, {{was one of}} the initiators of naturism <b>in</b> France during <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period.</b>|$|R
50|$|Constantin Mâţu was a Romanian {{journalist}} and lawyer from Chişinău, Bessarabia. He {{served as the}} president of Journalists and Lawyers Association <b>in</b> Bessarabia during <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period.</b>|$|R
5|$|Early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period,</b> he {{attended}} {{the dedication of the}} Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, in honor of the Americans who died in World War I, and met General of the Armies John Pershing, who commanded the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe during the war. Buckles then attended business school in Oklahoma City, and found work at a shipping company in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. From 1922 to 1923, he served with the Seventh Regiment of the New York National Guard in New York City where he also worked in financial services.|$|E
5|$|Politically, Belgian {{politics}} {{had been}} dominated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period</b> by the Catholic Party, usually in coalition with the Belgian Labour Party (POB-BWP) or the Liberal Party. The 1930s {{also saw the}} rise in popularity of Fascist parties within Belgium; most notably Rex which peaked at the 1936 election with 11% of the vote. From the early 1930s, Belgian foreign and domestic policy had been dominated by the policy of neutrality; leaving international treaties and alliances and attempting to maintain good diplomatic relations with both Britain, France and Germany.|$|E
5|$|SS George Washington was {{an ocean}} liner built in 1908 for the Bremen-based North German Lloyd {{and was named}} after George Washington, the first President of the United States. The ship was also known as USS George Washington (ID-3018) and USAT George Washington in service of the United States Navy and United States Army, respectively, during World War I. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period,</b> she reverted to her {{original}} name of SS George Washington. During World War II, the ship was known as both USAT George Washington and, briefly, as USS Catlin (AP-19), in a short, second stint in the U.S. Navy.|$|E

5|$|Scapa Flow {{provided}} the main anchorage for the British Grand Fleet {{throughout most of}} the First World War, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period</b> this passed to Rosyth, more conveniently located further south in the Firth of Forth. Scapa Flow was reactivated {{with the advent of the}} Second World War, becoming a base for the British Home Fleet. Its natural and artificial defences, while still strong, were recognised as in need of improvement, and in the early weeks of the war were in the process of being strengthened by the provision of additional blockships.|$|E
5|$|Yugoslav naval policy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period</b> lacked {{direction}} {{until the}} mid-1920s, {{although it was}} generally accepted that the Adriatic coastline was effectively a sea frontier that the naval arm was responsible for securing with the limited resources made available to it. In 1926, a modest ten-year construction program was initiated {{to build up a}} force of submarines, coastal torpedo boats, torpedo bombers and conventional bomber aircraft to perform this role. The Hrabri-class submarines were one of the first new acquisitions aimed at developing a naval force capable of meeting this challenge.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period,</b> the two cruisers {{served in}} the Cruiser Division, {{frequently}} alternating as the divisional flagship. Trento made two extensive trips abroad, {{the first was a}} tour of South American countries in mid to late-1929 and the second was a deployment to China to protect Italian nationals during the Chinese Civil War. In 1938, Trieste assisted in the repatriation of Italian volunteer soldiers who had fought in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Both ships saw extensive action in World War II, including the battles of Calabria, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan. Trieste was damaged by a British submarine in November 1941 and therefore missed the First and Second Battles of Sirte, where at the latter action Trento damaged a British destroyer.|$|E
40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{spirit of}} Hanson (1997), we analyze the {{existence}} of regional nominal wage gradients <b>in</b> Spain during <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period</b> (1914 - 1930) and their transformation fol­lowing an important change in trade policy. However, our case study analyzes {{the effects of the}} substitution of an open economy by a closed one - exactly the reverse of the process studied by Hanson. We find strong evidence of {{the existence of}} a regional wage gradient centered on Barcelona, which weakened after 1922. <b>In</b> Spain during <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period</b> protectionist policies appear to have favored the loss of centrality of the coastal location (Barcelona) and the relative rise of other locations...|$|R
50|$|It is also {{significant}} for its strong {{association with the}} important AMP Society, their outstanding success <b>in</b> Queensland during <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period,</b> and their contribution to working class welfare <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|R
50|$|Hilling, {{writing in}} 1976, remarks that <b>in</b> Wales <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period</b> is almost devoid of {{significantly}} progressive {{buildings and the}} abstract Neo-classicism of those public building that were erected had more <b>in</b> common with <b>the</b> architecture of Albert Speer and the Nazi and Fascist architecture. The Blackwood Miner's Institute built <b>in</b> 1925, for <b>the</b> Oakdale colliery <b>in</b> Monmouthshire shows <b>the</b> transition of Baroque revival architecture to the Art Deco style.|$|R
5|$|The Australian Army {{generally}} had {{a long-standing}} policy of using British-designed equipment, but equipment from Australia, the United States {{and some other}} countries was introduced into service in the war's later years. Pre-war defence policies favoured the RAN, which received the majority of defence spending <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period.</b> The result was that when war came in 1939, the Army's equipment was of World War I vintage, and Australian factories were only capable of producing small arms. Most equipment was obsolescent {{and had to be}} replaced, and new factories were required to produce the latest weapons, equipment and motor vehicles. Some 2,860 motor vehicles and motorcycles suitable for military use were purchased in 1939 for the Militia and another 784 for the 6th Division, but since a division's war establishment was around 3,000, this was only enough for training. In February 1940, the Treasury urged the War Cabinet to slow orders of motor vehicles to save the shipping space used for sending them to the Middle East for wheat cargoes.|$|E
5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations {{began in}} 1917 {{with a group}} of New York {{academics}} who were asked by President Woodrow Wilson to offer options for the foreign policy of the United States <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period.</b> Originally envisioned as a group of American and British scholars and diplomats, some of whom belonging to the Round Table movement, it was a subsequent group of 108 New York financiers, manufacturers and international lawyers organized in June 1918 by Nobel Peace Prize recipient and U.S. secretary of state Elihu Root, that became the Council on Foreign Relations on 29 July 1921. The first of the council’s projects was a quarterly journal launched in September 1922, called Foreign Affairs. The Trilateral Commission was founded in July 1973, at the initiative of American banker David Rockefeller, who was chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations at that time. It is a private organization established to foster closer cooperation among the United States, Europe and Japan. The Trilateral Commission is widely seen as a counterpart to the Council on Foreign Relations.|$|E
5|$|Tzara had {{enrolled}} at the University of Bucharest in 1914, studying mathematics and philosophy, but did not graduate. In autumn 1915, he left Romania for Zürich, in neutral Switzerland. Janco, together with his brother Jules, had settled there a few months before, and was later joined by his other brother Georges. Tzara, who may have applied for the Faculty of Philosophy at the local university, shared lodging with Marcel Janco, who {{was a student at}} the Technische Hochschule, in the Altinger Guest House (by 1918, Tzara had moved to the Limmatquai Hotel). His departure from Romania, like that of the Janco brothers, may have been in part a pacifist political statement. After settling in Switzerland, the young poet almost completely discarded Romanian as his language of expression, writing most of his subsequent works in French. The poems he had written before, which were the result of poetic dialogues between him and his friend, were left in Vinea's care. Most of these pieces were first printed only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E

MacKelvie completed the Field Artillery Battery Officers' Course <b>in</b> 1923, <b>the</b> U.S. Army Command and General Staff School <b>in</b> 1932, and <b>the</b> U.S. Army War College in 1936.|$|R
25|$|The Blackburn Perth was a British {{flying boat}} <b>in</b> service during <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period.</b> It was {{essentially}} an upgraded Iris, hence the largest flying-boat {{to serve with}} the Royal Air Force at the time (and the largest biplane flying boat ever to serve with the RAF).|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{regional}} editions, which are distributed throughout Transylvania, the national newspaper Ziua also runs a local franchise, Ziua de Cluj, {{that acts as}} a local daily, available only within city limits. Cluj-Napoca also boasts other newspapers of local interest, like Făclia and Monitorul de Cluj, as well as two free dailies, Informația Cluj and Cluj Expres. Clujeanul, {{the first of a series}} of local weeklies edited by the media trust CME, is one of the largest newspapers in Transylvania, with an audience of 53,000 readers per edition. This weekly has a daily online version, entitled Clujeanul, ediție online, updated on a real-time basis. Cluj-Napoca is also the centre of the Romanian Hungarian language press. The city hosts the editorial offices of the two largest newspapers of this kind, Krónika and Szabadság, as well as those of the magazines Erdélyi Napló and Korunk. Săptămâna Clujeană is an economic weekly published in the city, that also issues two magazines on successful local people and companies (Oameni de Succes and Companii de Succes) every year, while Piața A-Z is a newspaper for announcements and advertisements distributed throughout Transylvania. Cluj had an active press <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interwar</b> <b>period</b> as well: publications included the Zionist newspaper Új Kelet, the official party organs Keleti Újság (for the Magyar Party) and Patria (for the National Peasants' Party); and the nationalist Conștiința Românească and Țara Noastră, the latter a magazine directed by Octavian Goga. Under Communism, publications included the socio-political and literary magazines Tribuna, Steaua, Utunk, Korunk, Napsugár and Előre as well as the regional Communist party daily organs Făclia and Igazság and the trilingual student magazine Echinox.|$|E
