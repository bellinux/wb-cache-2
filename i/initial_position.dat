5|$|A star remains {{near its}} <b>initial</b> <b>position</b> {{on the main}} {{sequence}} until {{a significant amount of}} hydrogen in the core has been consumed, then begins to evolve into a more luminous star. (On the HR diagram, the evolving star moves up and {{to the right of the}} main sequence.) Thus the main sequence represents the primary hydrogen-burning stage of a star's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The battles began {{shortly after}} the Israeli {{declaration}} of independence, when Syria shelled Ein Gev {{on the night of}} May 15–16. They were the first military engagement between Israel and Syria. On May 18, Syria attacked the Israeli forward position in Samakh (Tzemah), and on May 20 attacked Degania Alef and occupied Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan. The attack on Degania Alef was a failure, after which the Syrian forces attempted to capture Degania Bet. After reaching a stalemate, they retreated to their <b>initial</b> <b>position</b> in Tel al-Qasr, where they remained {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
40|$|Standard {{particle}} swarm optimization cannot guarantee convergence to {{the global}} optimum in multi-modal search spaces, so multiple swarms can be useful. The multiple swarms all need <b>initial</b> <b>positions</b> and <b>initial</b> velocities for their particles. Several simple strategies to select <b>initial</b> <b>positions</b> and <b>initial</b> velocities are presented. A series of experiments isolates {{the effects of these}} selected <b>initial</b> <b>positions</b> and velocities compared to random <b>initial</b> <b>positions</b> and velocities. A first set of experiments shows how locust swarms benefit from 'scouting' for <b>initial</b> <b>positions</b> and the use of initial velocities that 'launch away' from the previous optimum. A second set of experiments show that the performance of WoSP (Waves of Swarm Particles) can be improved by using new search strategies to select the <b>initial</b> <b>positions</b> and <b>initial</b> velocities for the particles in its sub-swarms...|$|R

5|$|Two {{types of}} central forces—those that {{increase}} linearly with distance, F = Cr, such as Hooke's law, and inverse-square forces, , such as Newton's law of universal gravitation and Coulomb's law—have {{a very unusual}} property. A particle moving under either type of force always returns to its starting place with its initial velocity, provided that it lacks sufficient energy to move out to infinity. In other words, {{the path of a}} bound particle is always closed and its motion repeats indefinitely, no matter what its <b>initial</b> <b>position</b> or velocity. As shown by Bertrand's theorem, this property is not true for other types of forces; in general, a particle will not return to its starting point with the same velocity.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is derived from}} neural crest cells, which come from the {{ectoderm}} layer of the embryo. These cells migrate from their <b>initial</b> <b>position</b> and aggregate {{in the vicinity of}} the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs. These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system. Cells of the adrenal medulla are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex were once thought to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells. More recent research suggests that BMP-4 secreted in adrenal tissue is the main responsible for this, and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development of the cells.|$|E
5|$|However, Nansouty's move {{compromised}} Lannes's entire plan, which {{counted on}} powerful reinforcements arriving through Heinrichsdorf. An alarmed Lannes immediately sent {{one of his}} aides de camp to Grouchy urging him to stop the enemy from cutting his communications with the Emperor, whatever the cost. Grouchy duly took command of Nansouty's leading squadrons, ordering {{them back to their}} <b>initial</b> <b>position,</b> then launched a desperate but successful charge with his own dragoons, arriving in the streets of the village and cutting off its Russian defenders. Grouchy's dragoons became disorganised and were badly positioned following this sudden charge, and the Russian cavalry countercharged them, but Nansouty arrived just in time and the French repulsed the Russian cavalry, momentarily securing the position. A lively argument ensued between the two cavalry commanders. Grouchy invoked his seniority and position as commander of the cavalry and criticised Nansouty's earlier decision to withdraw. Nansouty countered by saying that he had superior experience at handling cavalry. When combat resumed, the quarrel did not prevent Nansouty from performing brilliantly under Grouchy's command during the dramatic series of events that followed. Having been repulsed earlier, the Russians decided to force the position at Heinrichsdorf, and they assembled a strong infantry force preceded by no less than 60 cavalry squadrons, plus around 2,000 Cossacks. To counter this move, Grouchy opted for deception, luring some of the enemy cavalry away from the infantry. Then, Grouchy charged the enemy horse from the front; simultaneously Nansouty hit them from the flank and together Grouchy and Nansouty repulsed them. Despite numerous charges and countercharges, the French cavalry maintained the upper hand.|$|E

50|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of sub-swarms {{is that their}} <b>initial</b> <b>positions</b> and <b>initial</b> velocities are not randomly selected as in normal swarms. Instead, they maintain some information from the previous trajectories of the particles. In general, the development of multi-swarm systems leads to design decisions which did not exist during the original development of particle swarm optimization, such {{as the number of}} particles to use in each sub-swarm, the optimal value for the constriction factor and the effects of non-random <b>initial</b> <b>positions</b> and <b>initial</b> velocities. These design decisions have been thoroughly studied and have well-established guidelines - e.g. the use of non-random <b>initial</b> <b>positions</b> and <b>initial</b> velocities leads to improved results in multi-swarm systems, which is not the case for single-swarms. Other design decisions, such as which diversification method to use or which specific search strategy will select the <b>initial</b> <b>positions</b> and <b>initial</b> velocities of a sub-swarm, have less established guidelines and constitute open questions in the field of multi-swarm systems.|$|R
