40|$|Biochar {{adsorption}} {{presents a}} potential remediation method {{for the control}} of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) pollution in the environment. It {{has been found that}} HOCs bound on biochar become less bioavailable, so speculations have been proposed that HOCs will persist for longer <b>half-life</b> <b>periods</b> in biochar-amended soil/sediment. To investigate how biochar application affects coupled adsorption-biodegradation, nonylphenol was selected as the target contaminant, and biochar derived from rice straw was applied as the adsorbent. The results showed that there was an optimal dosage of biochar in the presence of both adsorption and biodegradation for a given nonylphenol concentration, thus allowing the transformation of nonylphenol to be optimized. Approximately 47. 6 % of the nonylphenol was biodegraded in two days when 0. 005 g biochar was added to 50 mg/L of nonylphenol, which was 125 % higher than the relative quantity biodegraded without biochar, though the resistant desorption component of nonylphenol reached 87. 1 %. All adsorptive forms of nonylphenol (frap, fslow, fr) decreased gradually during the biodegradation experiment, and the resistant desorption fraction of nonylphenol (fr) on biochar could also be biodegraded. It was concluded that an appropriate amount of biochar could stimulate biodegradation, not only illustrating that the dosage of biochar had an enormous influence on the <b>half-life</b> <b>periods</b> of HOCs but also alleviating concerns that enhanced HOCs binding by biochar may cause secondary pollution in biochar-modified environment...|$|R

The application of this technique to German labour market regions shows regions moving at different speeds towards their steady states.

The {{value of the}} rate constant (k) {{was found to be}} higher in the case of inhibited iron samples (0.087) than uninhibited samples (0.049) whereas half-life (t 1 / 2) was found to be lower in the presence of inhibitor (8.0  min) than in its absence (14.0  min). This implies that the corrosion rate is higher in the absence of inhibitor than with inhibited mild iron samples. Similar results were reported on the kinetics of some organic compounds [52, 53]. Another indication of the rate of a first-order reaction is the time constant, τ, [53]. The time required for the concentration of the reactant to fall to 1 / 2 e of its initial value. The calculated values of the time constants are also presented and correlated. The results show that the time constants were lower (11.58  min) in the presence of PSC_ 1 than in its absence (20.26  min).

40|$|The soluble {{hydrogenase}} (hydrogen-NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1. 12. 1. 2) of Alcaligenes eutrophus H 16 {{was shown}} to be stabilized by oxidation with oxygen and ferricyanide as long as electron donors and reducing compounds were absent. The simultaneous presence of H 2, NADH and O 2 in the enzyme solution, however, caused an irreversible inactivation of hydrogenase that was dependent on the O 2 concentration. The <b>half-life</b> <b>periods</b> of 4 degrees C under partial pressures of 0. 1, 5, 20 and 50 % O 2 were 11, 5, 2. 5 and 1. 5 h respectively. Evidence has been obtained that hydrogenase produces superoxide free radical anions (O 2 -.), which were detected by their ability to oxidize hydroxylamine to nitrite. The correlation between O 2 concentration, nitrite formation and inactivation rates and the stabilization of hydrogenase by addition of superoxide dismutase indicated that superoxide radicals are responsible for enzyme inactivation. During short-term activity measurements (NAD+ reduction, H 2 evolution from NADH), hydrogenase activity was inhibited by O 2 only very slightly. In the presence of 0. 7 mM-O 2 an inhibition of about 20 % was observed...|$|R
