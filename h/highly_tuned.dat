5|$|The {{switch from}} high-altitude to low-altitude flight {{profiles}} severely affected the B-70, whose design was <b>highly</b> <b>tuned</b> {{to provide the}} desired high-altitude performance. Planners outlined a series of low-level profiles for the B-70, but higher aerodynamic drag at low level limited the B-70 to subsonic speed while dramatically decreasing its range. The result would be an aircraft with somewhat higher subsonic speed than the B-52, but less range. Unsuited for the new low-altitude role, and because of a growing shift to the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force, the B-70 bomber program was cancelled in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, and the two XB-70 prototypes were used in a supersonic research program.|$|E

25|$|Due to the flexibility, customizability {{and free}} and {{open-source}} nature of Linux, it becomes possible to <b>highly</b> <b>tune</b> Linux {{for a specific}} purpose. There are two main methods for creating a specialized Linux distribution: building from scratch or from a general-purpose distribution as a base. The distributions often {{used for this purpose}} include Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu (which is itself based on Debian), Arch Linux, Gentoo, and Slackware. In contrast, Linux distributions built from scratch do not have general-purpose bases; instead, they focus on the JeOS philosophy by including only necessary components and avoiding resource overhead caused by components considered redundant in the distribution's use cases.|$|R

The vehicle's {{name comes from}} the carbon fiber used to reduce the weight by 150lbs (total down to 3200lbs). However, even more significant were the engine modifications, which increased power to 625hp; no torque or RPM figures were given. Along with the carbon fiber hardtop, a front splitter and rear spoiler were added; however those parts were not nearly as significant as those on the later SRT-10 ACR, and no downforce/drag information was provided {{to show that they}} were even functional. The car was only a concept.|$|E
500|$|Connery's {{interpretation}} of the character differed considerably from Fleming's, being more promiscuous and cold blooded than the literary version. Connery described Bond as [...] "a complete sensualist—senses <b>highly</b> <b>tuned,</b> awake to everything, quite amoral. I particularly like him because he thrives on conflict". Academic James Chapman observed that for Dr. No, Connery's {{interpretation of}} the character, although not complete, showed the actor [...] "should be credited with having established a new style of performance: a British screen hero {{in the manner of}} an American leading man". In his second film, From Russia with Love, Connery looked less nervous and edgy; he gave [...] "a relaxed, wry performance of subtle wit and style". Pfeiffer and Worrall noted that Connery [...] "personified James Bond with such perfection that even Ian Fleming... admitted that it was difficult imagining anyone else in the part"; academic Jeremy Black agreed and declared that [...] "Connery made the role his own and created the Bond audience for the cinema". Black also observed that Connery gave the character a [...] "spare, pared-down character... inner bleakness along with the style". Connery played Bond with [...] "the right mix of cool charisma, violence and arrogance... against which all others are judged". Raymond Benson perceived that Connery [...] "embodies a ruggedness and an intense screen presence this transcends any preconceived notions about the character". Benson also noted that Bond was witty, but contains [...] "an assured toughness that epitomises the machismo male". Roger Moore agreed with Black and Benson, commenting that [...] "Sean was Bond. He created Bond. He embodied Bond and because of Sean, Bond became an instantly recognisable character the world over—he was rough, tough, mean and witty... he was a bloody good 007". However, despite his charm and virility, Connery was characteristically laconic in his delivery. Christopher Bray says of him that [...] "in his single-minded, laconic, mocking, self-sufficient vanity, Connery's Bond was the epitome of sixties consumer culture".|$|E

The original moulded rubber floor coverings were replaced with moulded carpets.|$|E
40|$|We study KKLT type {{models with}} moduli-mixing superpotential. In several string models, gauge kinetic {{functions}} are written as linear combinations {{of two or}} more moduli fields. Their gluino condensation generates moduli-mixing superpotential. We assume one of moduli fields is frozen already around the string scale. It is found that Kähler modulus can be stabilized at a realistic value without tuning 3 -form fluxes because of gluino condensation on (non-) magnetized D-brane. Furthermore, we do not need to <b>highly</b> <b>tune</b> parameters in order to realize a weak gauge coupling and a large hierarchy between the gravitino mass and the Planck scale, when there exists non-perturbative effects on D 3 -brane. SUSY breaking patterns in our models have a rich structure. Also, some of our models have cosmologically important implications, e. g., on the overshooting problem and the destabilization problem due to finite temperature effects as well as the gravitino problem and the moduli problem.

2500|$|While {{there are}} {{a large number of}} sorting algorithms, in {{practical}} implementations a few algorithms predominate. Insertion sort is widely used for small data sets, while for large data sets an asymptotically efficient sort is used, primarily heap sort, merge sort, or quicksort. Efficient implementations generally use a hybrid algorithm, combining an asymptotically efficient algorithm for the overall sort with insertion sort for small lists {{at the bottom of a}} recursion. <b>Highly</b> <b>tuned</b> implementations use more sophisticated variants, such as Timsort (merge sort, insertion sort, and additional logic), used in Android, Java, and Python, and introsort (quicksort and heap sort), used (in variant forms) in some C++ sort implementations and in [...]NET.|$|E

50|$|Theoretically, these shorter {{wavelengths}} {{correspond to}} vibrations at frequencies that are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc., times the fundamental frequency.

2500|$|The P-47M {{was a more}} {{conservative}} attempt {{to come up with}} a higher-performance ("Sprint") version of the Thunderbolt, designed to chase V-1 flying bombs, done, in part, by reducing armament from eight [...]50-caliber Colt-Browning M2 machine guns to six. In September 1944, four P-47D-27-RE airframes (42-27385/27388) were modified into prototype YP-47Ms by fitting the R-2800-57 engine and the GE CH-5 turbo-supercharger, a combination which could produce 2,800hp (2,089kW) at [...] when using Wartime Emergency Power (water injection). Air brakes were added to the wing's lower surfaces to allow braking after a dive onto its prey. The YP-47M had a top speed of 473mph (410kn, 761km/h) and it was put into limited production with 133 (sufficient for one group) built. However, the type suffered serious teething problems in the field due to the <b>highly</b> <b>tuned</b> engine. Engines were unable to reach operating temperatures and power settings and frequently failed in early flights from a variety of causes: ignition harnesses cracked at high altitudes, severing electrical connections between the magneto and distributor, and carburetor valve diaphragms also failed. Persistent oil tank ruptures in replacement engines were found to be the result of inadequate protection against salt water corrosion during transshipment. In the end, it was simply errors made by the R-2800-57 [...] model engine's manufacturers which led to these issues with the P-47M. By the time the bugs were worked out, the war in Europe was nearly over. However, P-47Ms still destroyed 15 enemy aircraft in aerial combat, normal results for any fighter type in March–May 1945 when aerial encounters with the Luftwaffe were rare. The entire production total of 130 P-47Ms were delivered to the 56th Fighter Group, and were responsible for all seven of that group's jet shoot-downs. Twelve were lost in operational crashes with the 56th Group resulting in 11 deaths, two after VE Day, and two (44-21134 on 13 April 1945 and 44-21230 on 16 April 1945) were shot down in combat, both by ground fire.|$|E
