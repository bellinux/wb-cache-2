2500|$|A May 2001 {{performance}} report {{showed that}} the D.C. fire department was deteriorating rapidly under Few's leadership. Halfway through the budget year, Few met only one of four major goals (filling 120 firefighter vacancies). The number of injuries to firefighters and civilian injuries and deaths had far outstripped the year's goals, and building inspections were far below the expected level. Ambulances were supposed to reach patients 90 {{percent of the time}} within eight minutes. Few changed this to 70 percent without explanation, and still the department could not reach the goal. The department was also caught manipulating data in an attempt to improve the response times. (For example, fire engines with paramedics aboard often responded faster to a medical emergency than a paramedic-driven ambulance with life-saving equipment. DCFEMS began incorporating fire <b>engine</b> <b>response</b> times and neglected to make the changed clear.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The LFA's {{engineers}} {{selected a}} V10 engine over an equivalent displacement V8 engine {{for its ability}} to rev higher, and over a V12 for its lower reciprocating mass, allowing for more rapid <b>engine</b> <b>response.</b> Lexus claims their engine can rev from idle to its redline in 0.6seconds and an analog tachometer needle could not accurately track the LFA's changes in engine speeds. This necessitated the use of a digital tachometer which can instantly display engine speed. The engine reportedly weighs less than the manufacturer's own 3.5-liter 2GR-FE V6 engine. Engineers attempted to make the engine sound like that of a Formula One car with high revs, {{while at the same time}} maintaining reliability and vibration control. Along with other manufacturers such as Ferrari, Toyota had produced their own F1 engines and chassis designs. The exhaust note has been described by Toyota engineers as the [...] "roar of an angel", and a US television spot later used the engine sound to shatter a champagne glass via resonance frequency.|$|E

40|$|The natural {{frequencies}} and dynamic {{responses of the}} NERVA 400 E engine thrust train were determined for nuclear space operations (NSO), and earth-orbital shuttle (EOS) during launch and boost conditions. For NSO, a mini-tank configuration was analyzed with the forward end of the upper truss assumed fixed at the stage/mini-tank interface. For EOS, both a mini-tank and an engine only configuration were analyzed for a specific engine assembly support (EAS) stiffness. For all cases {{the effect of the}} shield on dynamic response characteristics was determined by performing parallel analyses with and without the shield. Gimbaling loads were not generated as that effort was scheduled after the termination date. The analysis, while demonstrating the adequacy of the engine design, revealed serious deficiencies in the EAS.

The linearized design model includes both airframe and engine dynamics. A model-following formulation of the LQR problem is extended to handle this hybrid problem. Compensators are then obtained to realize an output-feedback control law, by using a loop-transfer-recovery procedure. The airframe and <b>engine</b> <b>responses</b> are decoupled, and perfect airframe response following is obtained. The loop transfers also reveal good stability robustness and reasonable loop cross-over frequencies that would not lead to excessive actuation requirements...|$|R
