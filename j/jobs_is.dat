5|$|Steve <b>Jobs</b> <b>is</b> a 2015 American biographical drama film {{directed}} by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin. Based on {{the biography of}} the same name by Walter Isaacson as well as interviews conducted by Sorkin, the film is structured into three acts which cover 14 years (1984–1998) in the life of personal computing innovator and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, with each act taking place immediately prior to the launch of a key product – the Apple Macintosh, the NeXT Computer and the iMac. <b>Jobs</b> <b>is</b> portrayed by Michael Fassbender, with Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Katherine Waterston, Michael Stuhlbarg and Jeff Daniels in supporting roles.|$|E
5|$|By 1998, Apple has fired Sculley, {{purchased}} NeXT, {{and named}} Jobs CEO, and <b>Jobs</b> <b>is</b> about to unveil the iMac at Davies Symphony Hall. He is delighted by Hoffman's strong commercial forecasts, but furious that Lisa has allowed {{her mother to}} sell the house Jobs bought for them. Hoffman reminds Jobs that he threatened to withhold Lisa's college tuition – Hertzfeld admits that he paid Lisa's tuition and suggested she attend therapy. Wozniak again asks that Jobs credit the Apple II team during the presentation, and again he refuses.|$|E

30|$|First, {{to achieve}} a {{description}} of the academic user, some criteria for defining an academic were adopted. In this research, people whose current <b>job</b> <b>was</b> student (undergraduate or postgraduate) or professor (anyone in a teaching position) were considered academics. People whose current <b>job</b> <b>was</b> not related to those roles were considered professionals. Nonetheless, some participants whose current <b>job</b> <b>was</b> student/professor and another unrelated <b>job</b> <b>were</b> considered both academics and professionals.|$|R

25|$|Ray McKinnon as Vernon T. Waldrip, Penny's {{bona fide}} suitor {{and the manager}} of Homer Stokes's {{election}} campaign. It {{has been suggested that}} his name is a nod to novelist Howard Waldrop, whose novella A Dozen Tough <b>Jobs</b> <b>is</b> one of the inspirations for the film. He corresponds to the Suitors of Penelope in the Odyssey.|$|E
50|$|At time 10, {{the value}} of {{accepting}} a good <b>job</b> <b>is</b> $100; {{the value of}} accepting a bad <b>job</b> <b>is</b> $44; the value of rejecting the <b>job</b> that <b>is</b> available is zero. Therefore, if he is still unemployed in the last period, he should accept whatever <b>job</b> he <b>is</b> offered at that time.|$|R

25|$|Careers in cello {{vary widely}} by genre and by region or country. Most cellists earn their living from {{a mixture of}} {{performance}} and teaching jobs. The first step to getting most performance <b>jobs</b> <b>is</b> by playing at an audition. In some styles of music, cellists {{may be asked to}} sight read printed music or perform standard repertoire with an ensemble.|$|E
25|$|The consigliere ("counselor") of {{the clan}} is also elected on a yearly basis. One of his <b>jobs</b> <b>is</b> to {{supervise}} {{the actions of the}} boss and his immediate underlings, particularly in financial matters (e.g. preventing embezzlement). He also serves as an impartial adviser to the boss and mediator in internal disputes. To fulfill this role, the consigliere must be impartial, devoid of conflict of interest and ambition.|$|E
25|$|For many refugees, the {{attraction}} of these <b>jobs</b> <b>is</b> the enhanced and sustainable access to goods and services through proximity to the commercial and relief actors, rather than the immediate cash benefit. Jobs in the commercial sector pay marginally better wages, ranging from $100–200 per month. It is possible for refugees to start small businesses, if the capital is available. Local businessmen have to obtain a trading licence costing 1,970 KSh per year.|$|E

25|$|The {{economy has}} shrunk by 50% from 2000 to 2007. In September 2007 the {{inflation}} rate was put at almost 8,000%, the world's highest. There are frequent power and water outages. Harare's drinking water became unreliable in 2006 {{and as a consequence}} dysentery and cholera swept the city in December 2006 and January 2007. Unemployment in formal <b>jobs</b> <b>is</b> running at a record 80%. There is widespread famine, which has been cynically manipulated by the government so that opposition strongholds suffer the most. Most recently, supplies of bread have dried up, after a poor wheat harvest, and the closure of all bakeries.|$|E

25|$|PAs are {{employed}} by the United States Department of State as Foreign Service Health Practitioners (FSHP). PAs working in this capacity may be deployed {{anywhere in the world}} where there is a State Department facility. They provide primary care to U.S. government employees and their families in American embassies and consulates around the world. An important part of their <b>jobs</b> <b>is</b> to get to know what resources are available locally that they can count on in an emergency. FSHPs have some other important roles, such as advising their ambassadors on the health situation in the country and provide health education to the diplomatic community. In order to be considered for the position of FSHP these PAs must be licensed and have at least two years of recent experience in primary care.|$|E
25|$|The Hood, which {{cannot be}} thrown or run with, is moved slowly by 'swaying', that is pushing and pulling the Hood and {{people within the}} 'Sway' toward the {{direction}} of their pub. Although everyone is trying to push in a particular direction, there are no real organised teams. The Sway makes very slow progress, as it snakes around, stopping quite often when it collapses, in order to pull bodies out, that became crushed into the mud. Safety is of prime concern {{and the whole thing}} is supervised by the Boggins. The Lord is referee and sees that the game is played fairly. At any one time there are usually around 200 people in the Sway and about one thousand people watching. Games can last anything from a couple of hours onwards and have been known to go on well into the night. Everything {{in the path of the}} Sway goes down before it, including hedges and walls. Another of the Boggins' <b>jobs</b> <b>is</b> to stop the Sway destroying everything in its path.|$|E
500|$|To {{distinguish}} each of {{the three}} product launches depicted in the movie, Danny Boyle and cinematographer Alwin Küchler implemented three different film formats: 16mm for 1984, 35mm for 1988, and digital for 1998. They also wanted {{each of the}} film's three time periods to visually reflect Jobs' own development at the time. For instance, Küchler explains that the filming at Flint Center, De Anza college for the first act combined the graininess of 16mm film and setting to accentuate a provisional, spontaneous look – much in the vein of how <b>Jobs</b> <b>is</b> portrayed at that time. The third act, shot with an Arri Alexa at the Davies Symphony Hall, incorporated an aesthetic and color palette that were intended to be representative of Jobs' own design philosophies of the iMac and subsequent Apple hardware. Küchler describes his experience filming Steve Jobs as [...] "brilliant and challenging at the same time", and that the goal was to [...] "make sure that the visuals kept up with the words", in reference to the production's collaboration between Boyle and Sorkin.|$|E
40|$|Grid {{computing}} {{is a form}} of {{distributed computing}} that involves coordinating and sharing data storage and network resource. The goal of grid <b>job</b> scheduling <b>is</b> to achieve high system throughput and match the job to the appropriate available computing resource. The complexity of scheduling problem increases with heterogeneous nature of grid and is highly difficult to schedule effectively. Existing algorithm does not adapt to the dynamic grid environment. In order to utilize the power of grid completely and to assign job to the resource dynamically an efficient algorithm called Adaptive Scoring <b>Job</b> Scheduling (ASJS) <b>was</b> introduced. However the bandwidth and storage capacity occupied by data intensive and computational intensive <b>job</b> <b>is</b> high and each time the user have to specify whether the <b>job</b> <b>is</b> computational intensive or data intensive [...] Due to this problem the <b>jobs</b> <b>are</b> not completed in time. To provide a solution to that problem Enhanced Adaptive Scoring <b>Job</b> scheduling algorithm <b>is</b> introduced. The <b>jobs</b> <b>are</b> identified whether it is data intensive or computational intensive and based on that the <b>jobs</b> <b>are</b> scheduled. The <b>jobs</b> <b>are</b> allocated by computing Cluster Score (CS). The <b>jobs</b> that <b>are</b> submitted by the user is divided into sub tasks and replicated. By using this strategy the job occupies lower storage capacity and bandwidth. Due to the dynamic nature of grid environment, each time the status of the resources changes and each time the Cluster Score (CS) is computed and the <b>jobs</b> <b>are</b> replicated and allocated to the most appropriat...|$|R

500|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that in contrast to previous statements {{about the number of}} firings related to the scandal [...] "new internal documents show that the real number of people removed from their <b>jobs</b> <b>is</b> much smaller still: at most, three". The Department of Veterans Affairs did not dispute this number, but said that disciplinary action is being taken against over 100 other employees. Congressional Republicans were outraged. Representative Jeff Miller said. [...] "“Rather than disciplining bad employees, V.A. often just transfers them to other V.A. facilities or puts them on paid leave for months on end," [...] and [...] "“Everyone knows accountability is a major problem at the department." [...] Miller said that he would introduce new legislation to hasten the firing process. Raymond Kelley, legislative director for Veterans of Foreign Wars, said that “The government firing system is so cumbersome bad employees can continue to be paid for years,” and “We need to show them you can no longer hide just because you have a government job, unclog the middle management that appears {{to be part of the}} problem and get the right people in those positions.” ...|$|E
500|$|In a Bloomberg West {{interview}} with Emily Chang on August 26, 2015, Andy Cunningham called it [...] "a wonderful film.... It's an incredible character {{study of a}} really complex man. Aaron [...] and Danny Boyle did a fabulous job with it." [...] Her portrayal by Sarah Snook was a [...] "small role but professionally done." [...] The film also portrays Andy as participating in the iMac launch, {{even though she was}} not working with Apple at that time. Journalist Walt Mossberg compared Steve Jobs to the Orson Welles film Citizen Kane, which was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. Mossberg has stated that while both films are aesthetically well-developed, Welles created a fictional set of characters in order to clarify that his film was a work of fiction. In contrast, according to Mossberg (who knew Jobs for 14 years), Sorkin's decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from the quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction. Mossberg states that [...] "the Steve Jobs portrayed in Sorkin's film isn't the man I knew. Sorkin chose to cherry-pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of Jobs' character, and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature [...] It would be as if you made a movie called JFK almost entirely focused on Kennedy's womanizing and political rivalries, and said nothing about civil rights and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Sorkin opts to end his story just as <b>Jobs</b> <b>is</b> poised to both reel off an unprecedented string of world-changing products and to mature into a much broader, kinder manager and person." ...|$|E
