40|$|A {{new type}} of fluid lifting {{equipment}} called Balanced Oil Recovery System (trade named BORS Lift{trademark}) was installed on several idle oil wells to demonstrate the operating efficiency of this innovative equipment technology. The BORS Lift system is designed to bring oil to the surface without the accompanying formation water. The BORS Lift system uses an innovative strap mechanism that takes oil {{from the top of}} the downhole oilwater column and lifts it to the surface, eliminating production of the formation water. Eliminating salt water production could potentially increase oil production, reduce operational costs, benefit the environment, and cut salt water disposal costs. Although the BORS Lift units did not function as intended, lessons learned during the course of the field demonstration project resulted in improvements in the technology and redesign of subsequent generation BORS Lift units which are reported to have significantly improved their performance characteristics. BORS Lift units were installed on 15 temporarily abandoned wells which had been shut down due to low oil production, high water production, and uneconomic operating conditions. The wells had been producing with artificial lift at a high watercut from a shallow (850 - 900 feet), pressure <b>depleted</b> <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> reservoir prior to being shut down. The electrical motor driven BORS Lift units provided a possible approach for economically returning the shallow, low-volume oil wells to production. The BORS Lift units used in this field demonstration were designed to recover up to roughly 22 barrels of fluid per day from depths ranging to 1, 700 feet, ideal for many marginal stripper well operations. The BORS units were first-production-model test units, operated under oil field conditions for the first time, and were naturally expected to experience some design problems. From the onset, the operator experienced mechanical, design, and operational problems with the BORS Lift units and was unable to maintain un-interrupted production operations. The inventor provided considerable on-site technical support in an ongoing effort to correct the problems with the units and the inventor worked extensively with the operator to make design and manufacturing changes to the units to try to improve their reliability and performance. The operational problems were mostly related to the durability of the various components under oil field operating conditions such as inadequate mechanical, electrical, and electronic design for rough service, extended operation, and severe weather conditions. During the course of the demonstration project, it further appeared that the producing formation lacked sufficient reservoir energy and/or favorable oil properties to mobilize and displace oil from the formation into the well bore in order to recharge the oil column in the well. The BORS Lift units were then moved to a second lease which appeared to have more favorable WTI quality oil properties. Eight of these units were reported to have been installed and placed in operation on the second lease, however, operational difficulties continued. It was determined that the units were inadequately designed and would need to be replace by improved second generation units. Due to the lack of success with the first generation units and the extra cost to replace them with the redesigned units, the operators decided not to continue with the project and the project was terminated at that point...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Oil</b> <b>sands</b> {{are natural}} {{deposits}} of sand {{materials that are}} rich in bitumen. Limited {{studies have been conducted}} to determine the dynamic behavior of <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> materials. Recent difficulties encountered in <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> mine fields in Canada substantiated the need to characterize the stress dependent, visco-elastic and plastic behavior of <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> materials under dynamic loading of off-road construction and mining equipment. This paper introduces a new cyclic triaxial test procedure for determining shear modulus and deformation characteristics of <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> materials. The test procedure was used to characterize shear moduli of three <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> materials with varying bitumen contents. From the test results, nonlinear shear modulus models were successfully developed to characterize temperature and stress dependent behavior of the tested <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> materials. The research findings indicate that the new laboratory approach is an improvement on conventional tests especially when <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> materials need to be evaluated in the field for subgrade construction and equipment mobility...|$|R

40|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>sands,</b> as {{unconventional}} <b>oil,</b> are so {{essential to}} both Canada {{and the world}} that special attention should be paid to their extraction status, especially their energy efficiency.
