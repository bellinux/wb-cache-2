In the presence of deterministic variables, we have to deal with non-existence of joint densities.

If initially the particle is located at a specific point (that is its probability distribution is the <b>dirac</b> <b>delta</b> <b>function),</b> then after time t its location is described by a normal distribution with variance t, which satisfies the diffusion equation. If the initial location is given by a certain density function g(x), then the density at time t is the convolution of g and the normal PDF.|$|E
25|$|A common paradox {{occurs with}} {{mathematical}} idealizations such as s which describe physical phenomena well at distant or global scales but break {{down at the}} point itself. These paradoxes are sometimes seen as relating to Zeno's paradoxes which all deal with the physical manifestations of mathematical properties of continuity, infinitesimals, and infinities often associated with space and time. For example, the electric field associated with a point charge is infinite {{at the location of}} the point charge. A consequence of this apparent paradox is that the electric field of a point-charge can only be described in a limiting sense by a carefully constructed <b>Dirac</b> <b>delta</b> <b>function.</b> This mathematically inelegant but physically useful concept allows for the efficient calculation of the associated physical conditions while conveniently sidestepping the philosophical issue of what actually occurs at the infinitesimally-defined point: a question that physics is as yet unable to answer. Fortunately, a consistent theory of quantum electrodynamics removes the need for infinitesimal point charges altogether.|$|E
500|$|In {{science and}} mathematics, the <b>Dirac</b> <b>delta</b> <b>function,</b> or [...] function, is a {{generalized}} function, or distribution that was historically {{introduced by the}} physicist Paul Dirac for modelling the density of an idealized point mass or point charge, as a function that is equal to zero everywhere except for zero and whose integral over the entire real line is equal to one. As there is no function that has these properties, the computations that were done by the theoretical physicists appeared to mathematicians as nonsense, until the introduction of distributions by Laurent Schwartz, for formalizing and validating mathematically these computations. This amounts, in particular, to define <b>Dirac</b> <b>delta</b> <b>function</b> as a linear functional, which maps every function to its value at zero. The Kronecker delta function, which is usually defined on a discrete domain and takes values 0 and 1, is a discrete analog of <b>Dirac</b> <b>delta</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E

500|$|In {{probability}} theory and statistics, the <b>Dirac</b> <b>delta</b> <b>function</b> {{is often used}} to represent a discrete distribution, or a partially discrete, partially continuous distribution, using a probability density function (which is normally used to represent fully continuous distributions).

500|$|One way to rigorously {{capture the}} notion of the <b>Dirac</b> <b>delta</b> <b>function</b> is to define a measure, which accepts as an {{argument}} a subset A of the real line R, and returns [...] if , and [...] otherwise. [...] If the delta function is conceptualized as modeling an idealized point mass at 0, then δ(A) represents the mass contained in the set A.

500|$|Despite its name, {{the delta}} {{function}} is not truly a function, {{at least not}} a usual one with range in real numbers.

500|$|An infinitesimal {{formula for}} an {{infinitely}} tall, unit impulse delta function (infinitesimal version of Cauchy distribution) explicitly appears in an 1827 text of Augustin Louis Cauchy. Siméon Denis Poisson considered {{the issue in}} connection with the study of wave propagation as did Gustav Kirchhoff somewhat later. [...] Kirchhoff and Hermann von Helmholtz also introduced the unit impulse as a limit of Gaussians, which also corresponded to Lord Kelvin's notion of a point heat source. [...] At the end of the 19th century, Oliver Heaviside used formal Fourier series to manipulate the unit impulse. The <b>Dirac</b> <b>delta</b> <b>function</b> as such was introduced as a [...] "convenient notation" [...] by Paul Dirac in his influential 1930 book The Principles of Quantum Mechanics.
