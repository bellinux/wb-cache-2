500|$|Johnson {{surprised}} many when {{he weighed}} in at 239pounds at the combine, 12pounds more than expected, although {{he claims that}} this season he played [...] "at about 235 and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 238" [...] and that his weight was not a problem. Johnson had told the media {{that he would not}} run the 40-yard dash at the combine but would wait until his March15 workout at Georgia Tech. Johnson ran a 4.35 and wowed scouts with his jump drill results, his receiving skills, and his 11ft 7in (3.53m) broad jump, which is [...] "best broad jump I can ever remember an NFL prospect having," [...] according to Gil Brandt. Johnson is the only player 6-foot-5 or taller, regardless of position, to run a 40-yard dash in under 4.40 seconds at the combine since 2006.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} crash, several {{witnesses}} described seeing an aircraft flying unusually low towards the Continental Divide. Some witnesses located on higher mountainside locations, such as Loveland Pass at , reported seeing it flying below them. Crash survivor Rick Stephens {{was a senior}} guard and stated in 2013, [...] "...as we flew along over I-70, that there were old mines and old vehicles above us. I noticed we were quite a bit below {{the top of the}} mountains. [...] <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> go to the cockpit, which wasn't unusual to do, and I could tell we were in trouble, looking out the window and seeing nothing but green in front of us." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> go. With an ironical {{gesture of}} remonstrance, she signed {{to me to}} sit down again.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> {{and walked}} <b>to</b> the window, {{and came back}} again and stood before her.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> {{and started}} <b>to</b> go into my study. She half rose, and her sewing {{fell to the}} floor.|$|R
60|$|I became enamoured. Her {{name was}} Henrietta. Contending with my easy disposition, <b>I</b> {{frequently}} <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> go after her. She also dwelt in the neighbourhood of the Obstacle, and I did fondly hope {{that no other}} would interpose {{in the way of}} our union.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} stand it, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> go away, feeling {{extremely}} particeps criminis. Mrs. Makely {{seemed to have a}} conscience as light as air.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{lay still}} afterward, and I thought he'd gone to sleep. Then the cabin {{seemed to grow}} strangely quiet, and when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> look at him I {{saw that he was}} dead." ...|$|E
60|$|Just as <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the door, a horse came {{galloping}} up, {{and passed}} me; a man jumped down, and taking off a fantail hat, came up, very gravely, {{to help me}} down.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{have told}} you once about your detestable habit of {{shouting}} in the house, Clarence, I {{have told you}} a hundred times. If you cannot be a Boy Scout quietly, you must stop being one altogether. <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> six that time." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} {{interval}} of silence, and then <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> and went <b>to</b> the fireplace where the bacon and sausages stood upon a trivet.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> {{and began}} <b>to</b> walk <b>up</b> {{and down the}} room, while she watched me with a silent calm which was incomprehensible. In vain I summoned my faculties to meet it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good night, mother," [...] and I went up {{and slammed}} my door upon her, blew out my candle, and lay down at once upon my bed, lay {{there a long time}} before <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> undress.|$|E
60|$|But my eyes fell on a {{calabash}} {{that hung}} {{against the wall}} over the table, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> look at it. I had been hunting for an old one and this was better than any I had seen outside the museum.|$|E
6000|$|... "They bade me go away, {{and again}} made me swear another oath. It was nearly dark then, {{and it was}} quite dark night before <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the house. But before I went I saw that there were many others {{standing}} idle about the place." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{next morning}} <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> at six, <b>to</b> make breakfast for Mr. Petersfield before he started. He was pleased at my having done so. We had {{not much time}} for talk, but before he went, I said,-- ...|$|R
60|$|She {{had quite}} broken down now, and her natural self was {{come back to}} us. When we came home, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> her <b>up</b> <b>to</b> her own room and Dermot went to his mother. She had a long, quiet sleep, lying on her bed, and when she woke it was growing dark on the May evening. She looked at me a little while without speaking, {{and her eyes were}} soft again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{tell you}} how that wink sort of froze me through and through. My only thought was {{to get out in}} the {{corridor}} as quick as ever <b>I</b> could. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> trying <b>to</b> look natural and easy. Perhaps they saw something--I don't know--but suddenly Mrs. Vandemeyer said 'Now,' and flung something over my nose and mouth as I tried to scream. At the same moment I felt a terrific blow {{on the back of my}} head...." ...|$|R
60|$|If I had {{not been}} angry clear through at that cub I might have let go. He {{ploughed}} {{my face in the}} dirt, and almost jerked my arms off. Suddenly the strain lessened. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> <b>to</b> see that the old hunter had hold of the other rope.|$|E
60|$|Marian's {{eyes met}} mine affectionately--I could say no more. My heart was full, my lips were trembling. In spite of myself I {{was in danger}} of {{appealing}} to her pity. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> leave the room. She rose at the same moment, laid her hand gently on my shoulder, and stopped me.|$|E
6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> go, he {{returned}} {{of his own}} accord to the forbidden subject. He said, [...] "I must beg you to do me two favors. The first is, not to let Mr. Romayne know that I am still in London. The second is, not to ask me for any explanations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{people thought}} that he started getting bigger around that time, and {{thought that he was}} as high as 360 or 375, much higher than his listed 345. [...] "That was outrageous, <b>I</b> never <b>got</b> that big," [...] said Brown. [...] "The biggest <b>I</b> ever <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> was maybe 350, {{something}} like that." [...] But the Packers were fine with his size. Despite his weight, he posted three sacks during the 1997 season, which tied his career high from 1994.|$|R
50|$|Poor old Lord Rolle, who is 82 (sic) and dreadfully infirm, in {{attempting}} to ascend the steps fell and rolled quite down, but was not the least hurt; when he attempted <b>to</b> re-ascend them <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> and advanced <b>to</b> {{the end of the}} steps in order to prevent another fall.|$|R
60|$|When Miss Harmer spoke, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> at once <b>to</b> leave, {{feeling a}} little ashamed of my own thoughtlessness, for papa had {{particularly}} warned me before I started, not to talk long; but I had quite forgotten his injunction, in the pleasure Mr. Harmer had evidently felt in listening to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "You weren't listening," [...] said Mr. Benham, reproachfully. [...] "I told you. This dog came snuffling up {{to where}} I was sitting--it was quite dark {{in the body of}} the theatre, you know--and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> say {{something}} about something that was happening on the stage, and somehow I must have given it a push with my foot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} I didn't when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> make my speech," [...] Francis assured his friend emphatically. [...] "The fellow {{was given an}} {{opportunity}} of making a clean breast of it, of course--Wensley, his lawyer, advised him to, in fact--but the story he told me was precisely the story he told at the inquest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Next mornin' <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{look for}} the ghost, and, sure enough, I found his remains! His pale body lay in a far corner o' the room doubled up and smashed to bits, and his pointed cap lay in another corner almost flat. That ghost," [...] {{concluded}} Rokens, with slow emphasis--"that ghost was the candle, it wos!" ...|$|E
60|$|Well, {{after the}} first agonizing five minutes, my stage-fright left me, never to return. I know if I {{was going to be}} hanged I could get up and make a good showing, and I intend to. But I shall never forget my {{feelings}} before the agony left me, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> here <b>to</b> thank you for her for helping my daughter, by your kindness, to live through her first appearance. And I {{want to thank you for}} your appreciation of her singing, which is, by-the-way, hereditary.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{behaved like}} an idiot, that's all. My nerves were in rags. I was worried. We're the hysterical animal, Mr. Capes. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> myself locked <b>up</b> <b>to</b> cool off. By {{a sort of}} instinct. As a dog eats grass. I'm right again now." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. JONES. No, your Worship, only {{to call me}} names. And {{of course}} {{in the morning when}} <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> and went <b>to</b> work he was asleep. And I don't know {{anything}} more about it until I came home again. Except that Mr. BARTHWICK--that 's my employer, your Worship--told me the box was missing.|$|R
60|$|To {{return to}} the jay. In spite of the keeper's persecution, I {{knew that he was}} there; every morning when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> look out of the window between four and five o'clock, I heard from some quarter of the village that curious subdued, but far-reaching, scolding note he is {{accustomed}} to utter when his suspicions have been aroused.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Land you! Why, you courted his society. I had {{practically}} to drag {{you away}} from him. When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> say good-bye, you were listening to him with bulging eyes. I never saw such a picture of rapt attention. Do {{you mean to tell}} me, Comrade Jackson, that your appearance belied you, that you were not interested? Well, well. How we misread our fellow creatures.' ...|$|E
60|$|All {{that you}} so earnestly {{say about the}} {{goodwill}} and devotion of all engaged, I perceived and deeply felt last night. It moved me {{even more than the}} demonstration itself, though I do suppose it was the most brilliant ever seen. When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> speak, but for taking a desperate hold of myself, I should have lost my sight and voice and sat down again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go {{out of the}} room; {{return to}} the nursery," [...] was her mandate. My look or {{something}} else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with extreme though suppressed irritation. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> <b>I</b> went <b>to</b> the door; I came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close <b>up</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was about}} one o'clock when I was woke up by a loud {{knocking}} at the door. I thought {{it must be a}} mistake, but after a minute it was repeated. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> and went <b>to</b> the window, and heard Hannah moving overhead. In another minute I heard her throw up her window and ask,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do? Why, I jist held {{my breath}} and looked, and in a minute it kind o' faded away, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> and went <b>to</b> the bed, but the man was gone. He lay there with the pleasantest {{smile on his face}} that ever you see; and I woke up Ruey, and told her about it." ...|$|R
