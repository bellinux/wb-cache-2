We previously identified BMP- 9 as the most osteogenic BMP in vitro and in vivo. Here we sought to investigate the bone regenerative capacity of murine-derived calvarial mesenchymal progenitor cells (<b>iCALs)</b> transduced by BMP- 9 {{in the context of}} healing critical-sized calvarial defects. To accomplish this, the transduced cells were delivered to the defect site within a thermoresponsive biodegradable scaffold consisting of poly(polyethylene glycol citrate-co-N-isopropylacrylamide mixed with gelatin (PPCN-g). A total of three treatment arms were evaluated: PPCN-g alone, PPCN-g seeded with <b>iCALs</b> expressing GFP, and PPCN-g seeded with <b>iCALs</b> expressing BMP- 9. Defects treated only with PPCN-g scaffold did not statistically change in size when evaluated at eight weeks postoperatively (p = 0. 72). Conversely, both animal groups treated with <b>iCALs</b> showed significant reductions in defect size after 12 weeks of follow-up (BMP 9 -treated: p = 0. 0025; GFP-treated: p = 0. 0042). However, H&E and trichrome staining revealed more complete osseointegration and mature bone formation only in the BMP 9 -treated group. These results suggest that BMP 9 -transduced <b>iCALs</b> seeded in a PPCN-g thermoresponsive scaffold is capable of inducing bone formation in vivo and is an effective means of creating tissue engineered bone for critical sized defects...|$|R
40|$|In plant development, cell-to-cell {{signaling}} {{is mediated}} by mobile signals, including transcription factors and small RNA molecules. This communication {{is essential for}} growth and patterning. Short-range movement of signals occurs in the extracellular space via the apoplastic pathway or directly from cell-to-cell via the symplastic pathway. Symplastic transport is mediated by plant specific structures called plasmodesmata, which are plasma membrane-lined pores that traverse the cell walls of adjacent cells thus connecting their cytoplasms. However, {{a thorough understanding of}} molecules moving via plasmodesmata and regulatory networks relying on symplastic signaling is lacking. Traffic via plasmodesmata is highly regulated, and callose turnover is known to be one mechanism. In Arabidopsis, plasmodesmata apertures can be regulated in a spatially and temporally specific manner with the <b>icals</b> 3 m, an inducible vector system expressing the mutated CalS 3 gene encoding a plasmodesmata localized callose synthase that increases callose deposition at plasmodesmata.

40|$|AbstractCritical-sized craniofacial defect repair {{represents}} a significant challenge to reconstructive surgeons. Many strategies have been employed {{in an effort}} to achieve both a functionally and cosmetically acceptable outcome. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) provide a robust osteoinductive cue to stimulate bony growth and remodeling. Previous studies have suggested that the BMP- 9 isoform is particularly effective in promoting osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells. The aim {{of this study is to}} characterize the osteogenic capacity of BMP- 9 on calvarial mesenchymal progenitor cell differentiation. Reversibly immortalized murine calvarial progenitor cells (<b>iCALs)</b> were infected with adenoviral vectors encoding BMP- 9 or GFP and assessed for early and late stages of osteogenic differentiation in vitro and for osteogenic differentiation via in vivo stem cell implantation studies. Significant elevations in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteocalcin (OCN) mRNA transcription, osteopontin (OPN) protein expression, and matrix mineralization were detected in BMP-treated cells compared to control. Specifically, ALP activity was elevated on days 3, 7, 9, 11, and 13 post-infection and OCN mRNA expression was elevated on days 8, 10, and 14 in treated cells. Additionally, treatment groups demonstrated increased OPN protein expression on day 10 and matrix mineralization on day 14 post-infection relative to control groups. BMP- 9 also facilitated the formation of new bone in vivo as detailed by gross, microcomputed tomography, and histological analyses. Therefore, we concluded that BMP- 9 significantly stimulates osteogenic differentiation in <b>iCALs,</b> and should be considered an effective agent for calvarial tissue regeneration...|$|R

40|$|The {{decision}} support system (DSS) MIRRIG has been developed to support the design of microirrigation systems and to advise farmers {{as a result of}} field evaluations. It is written in Visual Basic 6. 0, runs in a Windows environment, and uses a database with information on emitters and pipes available in the market, as well as on crops, soils and the systems under design. MIRRIG is composed by design and simulation models and a multicriteria analysis model that ranks alternative design solutions based upon an integration of technical, economic and environmental criteria. User friendly windows are adopted for handling the databases and to manage the sub-models. The model allows creating and comparing a set of design alternatives relative to the pipe system and the emitters, either drip or microsprinkling emitters. For each alternative, the pipe system is sized and the irrigation system is simulated to produce performance, environmental and economic indicators. These include uniformity of water application, potential for contamination with agrochem- <b>icals</b> due to water percolation, and installation and operation costs. Those indicators are used as attributes of the selected criteria.
