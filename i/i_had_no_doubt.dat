500|$|Jardine {{asked me}} if I could bowl on the leg stump making the ball come up into the body all the time, so that Bradman had to play his shots to leg. [...] "Yes, I think that can be done", I said... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> of its purpose: we thought Don was frightened of sharp rising balls, and we {{reasoned}} that if he {{got a lot of}} them he would be... intimidated and eventually, having to direct his shots to leg all the time, would give a catch to one of the [...] fieldsmen".|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that Barbra {{would sing}} {{the hell out}} of 'We're Not Making Love Anymore' – and not just because {{she is one of the}} world's {{greatest}} singers. I began writing the song from the heart during my divorce, and Barbra sang it from heart in the studio. I was not at all shocked when her single immediately hit the Top 10 of the Adult Contemporary charts in 1989 [...] As much as that song means to me – I'm proud and thankful to have co-written it – I'll never be able to hear it without associating it with a sad time in my life.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the book}} were positive, with Nolan Howell of Canoe.com {{describing}} it as a [...] "straightforward look {{into the life of}} a man that has dedicated himself to the sport of professional wrestling" [...] and has [...] "an endearing, personal style that gives an apt representation of the author...For fans such as myself who appreciated the blunt style of the man known as Hardcore Holly, this ECW Press product will be an entertaining, worthwhile look into one of the unique personalities of professional wrestling." [...] Joe Babinsack, writing for the Wrestling Observer, described the book as [...] "brutal, boisterous and definitely worth reading". Bruce Mitchell, writing for the Pro Wrestling Torch, described the book as [...] "hard-hitting, straightforward, and not very fancy", rating it [...] "one of the strongest professional wrestling books in a long while". Dave Meltzer, editor of the Wrestling Observer wrote, [...] "in a lot of books, you think you're reading what the person writing feels {{is the right thing to}} say for their career... With Holly, whether you agree or not (and I agreed with some of his stuff, not others), <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> he was giving his true opinions on things. In that sense, it was a very honest look at a period of WWF history from a guy who had ups and downs... but survived a long time." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{used to be}} a real leftist. I {{remember}} Arik Sharon [...] coming here, to my house, a {{few months}} before Camp David, when he was still leader of the opposition. He told me there would be no deal because [...] Arafat would not sign. I told myself that {{there was nothing to be}} done – these right-wingers were simply insane. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that there would be a deal and the problems would be resolved. History proved that Sharon was right and I was wrong. In matters relating to security, that moved me to the right. Very far to the right...When there is a terrorist attack, I am [...] Lieberman. Sometimes to the right of Lieberman. For two days I really love Lieberman. But afterward I come back to reality. Look, I don't see a solution today." ...|$|E
2500|$|The damage {{occurred}} {{when she was}} flying a mission over Baghdad on April 7, 2003. [...] "We did our job with the guys there on the ground, and as {{we were on our}} way out is when I felt the jet get hit. It was pretty obvious — it was loud... I lost all hydraulics instantaneously, and the jet rolled left and pointed toward the ground, which was an uncomfortable feeling over Baghdad. It didn't respond to any of my control inputs." [...] She tried several procedures to get the aircraft under control, none of which worked; last, she put the plane into manual reversion, meaning she was flying the aircraft without hydraulics. The aircraft immediately responded. [...] "The jet started climbing away from the ground, which was a good feeling because there was no way I wanted to eject over Baghdad." [...] With some technical advice from her flight leader, Lieutenant Colonel Turner, she flew the injured plane for an hour back to the air base. [...] "The jet was performing exceptionally well. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> in my mind I was going to land that airplane." [...] Landing was tricky: [...] "When you lose all the hydraulics, you don't have speed brakes, you don't have brakes, and you don't have steering." ...|$|E

Tomorrow we will begin to teach him to ride and to shoot, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that he will be ready, in return, to teach you a great deal about his country." ...|$|R
60|$|If {{these men}} had stolen the boat shortly after dark (which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> they did), we were {{near enough to}} the land to make it vain to send in pursuit of them, when the {{discovery}} {{was made in the}} morning. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> they got ashore, in that calm weather (making all due allowance for fatigue and clumsy rowing), before day-break.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> {{then that}} Steele {{intended}} to make him stand out before this crowd as the real mayor of Linrock or as a man whose office was a sham.|$|E

I {{asked him}} the question, and he replied, 'I can hardly make a {{permanent}} appointment now, as I am not quite in the saddle; but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> {{from what you}} say, that Mr. Hilliard will make a valuable officer; and after our first campaign I shall, without difficulty, be able to obtain him a permanent appointment in the Egyptian army.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} a capital plan," [...] the squire agreed warmly. [...] "The very thing. I should get off all the bother with strange women, and the child would have a lady she is already fond of, and who, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> is {{thoroughly}} qualified for the work. Nothing could be better. I will walk down this afternoon and see her myself, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>I</b> shall be able to arrange it.|$|R
60|$|Now we {{had only}} to wait for Sergeant Corney, and, having seen {{what he could do}} in the wilderness, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> but that he would succeed in his purpose, which he soon did.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was a {{very active}} boy, used to {{climbing}} and {{all that sort of}} thing, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that I could easily get into the house; but I did not fancy my father's scheme.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not like}} her protesting so much as this; but I {{saw that it was}} a {{condition}} of her being able to deal with herself in the matter, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> she was telling the truth.|$|E

60|$|I protested. I said I {{was going}} to take a {{vacation}} anyway, and business was not pressing just then. I also hinted that, while <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> of her capacity, she might have found the duties of superintendent rather arduous.|$|E
60|$|I made my {{way there}} and took up the {{receiver}} without any special interest. Ralph was fidgety these days, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that {{he had something to}} say to me about the shooting. His first words, however, riveted my attention.|$|E
60|$|Springing up the ladder, I {{hastened to}} the cabin, pondering as I went the strange {{testimony}} borne by these {{men to the}} effect of the Gospel on savage natures--testimony which, as it was perfectly disinterested, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> whatever was strictly true.|$|E

60|$|He {{could not}} conceal his rage, disappointment, and surprise; {{and in the}} passage (<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt)</b> was shaken by St. Vitus.|$|R
60|$|But I gave little heed to that. My {{principal}} {{thought at}} that moment was my personal safety; so I ran on as fast as I could {{in the direction of}} our encampment, for which point, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> my companions would also make.|$|E
60|$|How long I lay, I know not; {{probably}} not long, for I was restored {{to a state}} of consciousness by being plunged into the sea. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> that the captain had ordered me to be thrown overboard, just after I fell under his brutal blow.|$|E
60|$|I said I would {{mention it}} to Mr. Wickfield, and if he approved, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> he would, I would come with pleasure. So, at six o'clock that evening, {{which was one of}} the early office evenings, I {{announced}} myself as ready, to Uriah.|$|E
