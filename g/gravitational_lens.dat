The detection of two caustics were logged {{over the next few}} days by the South African Astronomical Observatory, the Perth Observatory, and the Canopus Hill Observatory in Tasmania, with a separation of about seven days between caustic events.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{publicity}} surrounding the telescope's tracking of space probes, this only {{took up a}} fraction of its observing time, with the remainder used for scientific observations. These include using radar to measure {{the distance to the}} Moon and to Venus; observations of astrophysical masers around star-forming regions and giant stars; observations of pulsars (including the discovery of millisecond pulsars and the first pulsar in a globular cluster); observations of quasars and gravitational lenses (including the detection of the first <b>gravitational</b> <b>lens</b> and the first Einstein ring). The telescope has also been used for SETI observations.|$|E

25|$|A multiple-image quasar is a quasar whose light {{undergoes}} gravitational lensing, {{resulting in}} double, triple or quadruple {{images of the}} same quasar. The first such <b>gravitational</b> <b>lens</b> to be discovered was the double-imaged quasar Q0957+561 (or Twin Quasar) in 1979. A grouping {{of two or more}} quasars can result from a chance alignment, physical proximity, actual close physical interaction, or effects of gravity bending the light of a single quasar into two or more images.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, the {{telescope}} {{was used in}} conjunction with the Mark III to develop phase stable long baseline interferometers, leading to the development of MERLIN. The telescope was used as an interferometer with the Lovell Telescope to provide more accurate positions for radio sources found from a survey done in 1972 and 1973; the position of one radio source was found to coincide with a pair of faint blue stars, and after optical observations were made it was found to be the first <b>gravitational</b> <b>lens.</b> The majority of the current observational time of the Mark II is spent either on MERLIN or VLBI observations.|$|E
25|$|Strong lensing is the {{observed}} distortion of background galaxies into arcs when their light passes {{through such a}} <b>gravitational</b> <b>lens.</b> It has been observed around many distant clusters including Abell 1689. By measuring the distortion geometry, {{the mass of the}} intervening cluster can be obtained. In the dozens of cases where this has been done, the mass-to-light ratios obtained correspond to the dynamical dark matter measurements of clusters. Lensing can lead to multiple copies of an image. By analyzing the distribution of multiple image copies, scientists have been able to deduce and map the distribution of dark matter around the MACS J0416.1-2403 galaxy cluster.|$|E
40|$|<b>Gravitational</b> <b>lenses</b> {{are rare}} in the known samples of quasars, {{indicating}} that the conditions involved in their formation are unusual. In particular, the distribution of matter along the light rays from the observer through the deflector to the quasar may {{be very different from}} mean conditions. It is shown that reasonable deviations in the density of matter along the beams can significantly alter the relationship between time delays and the Hubble constant, and it is concluded that <b>gravitational</b> <b>lenses</b> are not promising estimators of this constant. However, should an independent, precise determination of the Hubble constant become available, <b>gravitational</b> <b>lenses</b> could be used to probe long-range density fluctuations...|$|R

50|$|Most of the <b>gravitational</b> <b>lenses</b> in {{the past}} have been {{discovered}} accidentally. A search for <b>gravitational</b> <b>lenses</b> in the northern hemisphere (Cosmic Lens All Sky Survey, CLASS), done in radio frequencies using the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, led to the discovery of 22 new lensing systems, a major milestone. This has opened a whole new avenue for research ranging from finding very distant objects to finding values for cosmological parameters so we can understand the universe better.|$|R
25|$|The cosmic {{experiment}} {{envisioned by}} Wheeler {{could be described}} either as analogous to the interferometer experiment or as analogous to a double-slit experiment. The {{important thing is that}} by a third kind of device, a massive stellar object acting as a <b>gravitational</b> <b>lens,</b> photons from a source can arrive by two pathways. Depending on how phase differences between wavefunction pairs are arranged, correspondingly different kinds of interference phenomena can be observed. Whether to merge the incoming wavefunctions or not, and how to merge the incoming wavefunctions can be controlled by experimenters. There are none of the phase differences introduced into the wavefunctions by the experimental apparatus as there are in the laboratory interferometer experiments, so despite there being no double-slit device near the light source, the cosmic experiment is closer to the double-slit experiment. However, Wheeler planned for the experiment to merge the incoming wavefunctions by use of a beam splitter.|$|E

40|$|Measurements of the {{spectrum}} of the fluctuations of the output current of the quadratic detector of a telescope {{can be used to}} find unresolved astronomical <b>gravitational</b> <b>lenses</b> and determine time delays between their image components.

2500|$|Draco also {{features}} several interacting galaxies and galaxy clusters. One such massive cluster is Abell 2218, located {{at a distance}} of 3 billion light-years (redshift 0.171). It acts as a <b>gravitational</b> <b>lens</b> for even more distant background galaxies, allowing astronomers to study those galaxies as well as Abell 2218 itself; more specifically, the lensing effect allows astronomers to confirm the cluster's mass as determined by x-ray emissions. One of the most well-known interacting galaxies is Arp 188, also called the [...] "Tadpole Galaxy". Named for its appearance, which features a [...] "tail" [...] of stars 280,000 light-years long, the Tadpole Galaxy is {{at a distance of}} 420 million light-years (redshift 0.0314). The tail of stars drawn off the Tadpole Galaxy appears blue because the gravitational interaction disturbed clouds of gas and sparked star formation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to avoid {{destroying}} normal ideas of cause and effect, some theoreticians suggested that information about whether there was or was not a second beam-splitter installed could somehow be transmitted from the end point of the experimental device back to the photon as it was just entering that experimental device, thus permitting it to make the proper [...] "decision." [...] So Wheeler proposed a cosmic version of his experiment. In that thought experiment he asks {{what would happen if}} a quasar or other galaxy millions or billions of light years away from Earth passes its light around an intervening galaxy or cluster of galaxies that would act as a <b>gravitational</b> <b>lens.</b> A photon heading exactly towards Earth would encounter the distortion of space {{in the vicinity of the}} intervening massive galaxy. At that point it would have to [...] "decide" [...] whether to go by one way around the lensing galaxy, traveling as a particle, or go both ways around by traveling as a wave. When the photon arrived at an astronomical observatory at Earth, what would happen? Due to the gravitational lensing, telescopes in the observatory see two images of the same quasar, one to the left of the lensing galaxy and one to the right of it. If the photon has traveled as a particle and comes into the barrel of a telescope aimed at the left quasar image it must have decided to travel as a particle all those millions of years, or so say some experimenters. That telescope is pointing the wrong way to pick up anything from the other quasar image. If the photon traveled as a particle and went the other way around, then it will only be picked up by the telescope pointing at the right [...] "quasar." [...] So millions of years ago the photon decided to travel in its guise of particle and randomly chose the other path. But the experimenters now decide to try something else. They direct the output of the two telescopes into a beam-splitter, as diagrammed, and discover that one output is very bright (indicating positive interference) and that the other output is essentially zero, indicating that the incoming wavefunction pairs have self-cancelled.|$|E
