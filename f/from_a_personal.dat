5|$|By {{gathering}} clues and {{manipulating the}} environment, the player solves thematically linked puzzles. For example, the book leading to Voltaic is accessed by aligning beams of light across a canyon; the Age itself contains similar energy-based puzzles. Edanna's plant-filled puzzles require {{manipulation of the}} Age's ecosystem. Puzzles often involve observing interactions between elements of the environment, then adjusting the links between them. The player can also pick up and view journals or pages written by game characters which reveal back-story and give hints to solving puzzles. Cursor Mode allows the player to select items <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> inventory {{at the bottom of}} the screen.|$|E
5|$|Princess Victoria {{soon came}} to hate Conroy who bullied and insulted her, mocking her {{economical}} habits. Some historians have conjectured that Conroy's arrogant behaviour towards Victoria may have stemmed <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> belief {{that his wife}} Elizabeth was secretly the illegitimate child of the Duke of Kent. While the rumour was later proven false, Conroy's strong ambition may have stemmed from this self-perceived connection to the aristocracy. Ambition {{may also have been}} influenced by Conroy's claim of descent from the ancient kings of Ireland. Regardless of his claims of grandeur, Conroy belonged to the middle class and recognised the growing power of this group within British society.|$|E

25|$|Sicking {{has devoted}} {{his career to}} {{designing}} impact energy management systems, specifically focusing on crashworthy safety systems. Sicking has developed numerous “next generation” designs that have significantly reduced the risk of injury and fatality to motorists, from highway drivers to NASCAR racers. His first global success was the ET-2000, the first energy absorbing guardrail terminal – a device that sits over {{the end of a}} guardrail, flattening the guardrail when it is hit by a vehicle. The first study of the device showed that out of 400 crashes, there were three injuries and no fatalities—reducing the risk by a factor of 10. But even with detailed research data and real-world results showing the product a success, Sicking says he gets the most satisfaction <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> testimonial.|$|E
25|$|Ferdo Šišić {{considered}} that is impossible it directly originated <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> {{name of an}} Avar ruler because the title needs a logical continuity. He doubted its existence among Slavic tribes during the great migration, and within early South Slavic principalities. He strongly supported the Šafárik thesis about Avar descendants in Lika, now dismissed by scholars, and concluded that in that territory they had a separate governor whom they called bajan, from which after Avar assimilation, became Croatian title ban. The thesis of alleged Avar governor title Šišić based on his personal derivation of bajan from the title khagan. Nada Klaić advocated the same claims of Avars descendants in Lika, and considered bans and župans as Avar officials and governors.|$|E
25|$|The National Library of Nepal is in Patan. It is {{the largest}} library {{in the country with}} more than 70,000 books. English, Nepali, Sanskrit, Hindi, and Nepal Bhasa books are found here. The library is in {{possession}} of rare scholarly books in Sanskrit and English dating from the 17th century AD. Kathmandu also contains the Kaiser Library, in the Kaiser Mahal {{on the ground floor of}} the Ministry of Education building. This collection of around 45,000 books is derived <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> collection of Kaiser Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana. It covers a wide range of subjects including history, law, art, religion, and philosophy, as well as a Sanskrit manual of Tantra, which is believed to be over 1,000 years old. The 2015 earthquake caused severe damage to the Ministry of Education building, and the contents of the Kaiser Library have been temporarily relocated.|$|E

25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. <b>From</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E
25|$|After touring duties for {{the album}} were finished, Metallica {{filed a lawsuit}} against Elektra Records, which tried to force the record label to {{terminate}} the band's contract and give the band ownership of their master recordings. The band based its claim on a section of the California Labor Code that allows employees to be released <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> services contract after seven years. Metallica had sold 40million copies worldwide upon the filing of the suit. Metallica had been signed to the label for over a decade but was still operating under the terms of its original 1984 contract, which provided a relatively low 14% royalty rate. The band members said they were taking the action because they were ambivalent about Robert Morgado's refusal to give them another record deal along with Bob Krasnow, who retired from his job at the label shortly afterwards. Elektra responded by counter-suing the band, but in December 1994, Warner Music Group United States chairman Doug Morris offered Metallica a lucrative new deal in exchange for dropping the suit, which was reported to be even more generous than the earlier Krasnow deal. In January 1995, both parties settled out of court with a non-disclosure agreement. Metallica played the album in its entirety during the 2012 European Black Album Tour.|$|E
25|$|The deities of Hinduism {{have evolved}} from the Vedic era (2nd {{millennium}} BCE) through the medieval era (1st millennium CE), regionally within Nepal, India and in southeast Asia, and across Hinduism's diverse traditions. The Hindu deity concept varies <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> god as in Yoga school of Hindu philosophy,Lloyd Pflueger, Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 38-39;Kovoor T. Behanan (2002), Yoga: Its Scientific Basis, Dover, , pages 56-58 to 33 Vedic deities, to hundreds of Puranics of Hinduism. Illustrations of major deities include Vishnu, Sri (Lakshmi), Shiva, Parvati (Durga), Brahma and Saraswati. These deities have distinct and complex personalities, yet are often viewed as aspects of the same Ultimate Reality called Brahman. From ancient times, the idea of equivalence has been cherished for all Hindus, in its texts and in early 1st millennium sculpture with concepts such as Harihara (half Shiva, half Vishnu), Ardhanarishvara (half Shiva, half Parvati) or Vaikuntha Kamalaja (half Vishnu, half Lakshmi), with myths and temples that feature them together, declaring they are the same. Major deities have inspired their own Hindu traditions, such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism, but with shared mythology, ritual grammar, theosophy, axiology and polycentrism. Some Hindu traditions such as Smartism from mid 1st millennium CE, have included multiple major deities as henotheistic manifestations of Saguna Brahman, and {{as a means to}} realizing Nirguna Brahman.|$|E

Programming and keyboards were carried out by Shellback and additional keyboards were performed by Holter, Erixson and Martin.|$|E
500|$|The musical {{style of}} Hermética was {{considered}} to be [...] "old-fashioned". The band achieved success {{as a result of their}} introspective lyrics. Unlike most heavy metal bands, Hermética's music was appealing to poor people. Iorio wrote about his thoughts and concerns <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> perspective. He stated that some of his lyrics were inspired by 1940s Argentine tango music. Hermética was part of the Rock chabón movement within Argentine rock; their music was influenced by Argentine nationalism, family values and neighbourhood-centered localism. Iorio said that he does not support racism or fascism. The lyrics, except for covers, were always written in Spanish because Iorio does not approve of artists who write in English to gain foreign audience. The first two albums addressed a variety of topics; the track [...] "Memoria de siglos" [...] ("Memory of centuries") references the cult of personality, buck passing, peace through strength, and wage slavery. Each song from their third album is devoted to a different subject.|$|E
