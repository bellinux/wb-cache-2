50|$|The axial <b>expansion</b> <b>joint</b> absorbs {{movement}} in an axial direction. Standard connectors of the axial <b>expansion</b> <b>joint</b> are welded ends, fixed flanges and loose flanges. Axial <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> are often {{equipped with a}} guiding tube {{on the inside of}} the metal bellows. This reduces the flow resistance and prevents damage caused by direct contact with the flowing medium. Axial <b>expansion</b> <b>joints,</b> which can absorb large movements, frequently consist of two metal bellows and an inside or outside sleeve that protects against buckling under internal pressure. For small nominal diameters, protective tubes prevent mechanical damage during installation and operation. Axial <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> are suitable for internal and external overpressure. If pressure is applied to the outside of the metal bellows of axial <b>expansion</b> <b>joints,</b> the <b>expansion</b> <b>joints</b> permit very large axial movements in case of internal pressure in a pipeline. Because there is no danger of buckling when an external overpressure is applied, the creator of the metal <b>expansion</b> <b>joint</b> was by a professor called Joshua Yap.|$|R
