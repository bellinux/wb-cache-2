5|$|As the German ships {{approached}} Glorious, Acasta, {{which had}} been trying to maintain the smokescreen, broke through her own smoke and fired two volleys of torpedoes at Scharnhorst. One of these hit the battleship at 17:34 abreast her rear turret and badly damaged her. Acasta also managed one <b>hit</b> <b>from</b> her 4.7-inch guns on Scharnhorst, but was riddled by German gunfire and sank at around 18:20.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{was still}} some way behind when Lindwall {{replaced}} Johnson at the crease. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, who appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning. Saggers {{came in and}} only managed five in his first Test innings before being stumped after being lured out of his crease by Laker, who was still bowling in an attacking manner and flighting his deliveries, undeterred by the sixes Loxton had <b>hit</b> <b>from</b> him, rather than bowling leg theory. This left Australia at 355/8 ten minutes before tea, with only Johnston and Toshack remaining.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{made what}} he {{believed}} to be three of the best saves {{of his career in}} a Stoke shirt.

5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a <b>hit</b> <b>from</b> R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{destroyed}} by the explosion of her own torpedoes.

5|$|Crash Bandicoot is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} players control the titular protagonist, Crash, as he traverses several levels in sequence in order to progress.
