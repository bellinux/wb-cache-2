2500|$|Miller {{later said}} of his peak period in the mid-1970s: [...] "When I won at Tucson by nine shots in 1975, I would say the average iron shot I hit that week {{was no more than}} two feet off line. It was unbelievable. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> peak, I would go into streaks where I felt that I could knock down the pin from {{anywhere}} with my irons. I played some golf that I think is unequaled." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ullman, who {{had already}} {{made a name for}} herself as a comedian with her BBC comedy series Three of a Kind, had a chance {{encounter}} with the wife of the head of the punk music label Stiff Records, Dave Robinson. The meeting led to her recording her first album. “One day, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> hairdresser, and Dave Robinson’s wife Rosemary leant over and said, ‘Do {{you want to make a}} record?’ I was having some of those Boy George kind of dreadlock things put in and I went, ‘Yeah I want to make a record.’ I would have tried anything.” ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I Will Try" [...] {{is about}} having a {{positive}} outlook on life. James has explained that he has 'a very negative outlook on the world' and that he can 'never really appreciate anything' so the song is a reminder to himself to try and {{look on the bright}} side. He continued; 'the line [...] "I've got friends who have lost their fathers and they're much stronger men than me" [...] refers mainly to Chris (Pennells, guitar), Jamie (manager) and my dear friend David Rice who have lost family members and yet still find a smile and appreciate all the upsides of life'. [...] "Little White Lies" [...] is about dishonesty. The song 'covers the way that lies eat away at my brain and cause me to almost lose my mind, yet I still keep making mistakes and bad decisions', according to James. He revealed little about the background of [...] "Leeches", saying only that 'Leeches is about something terrible and unspeakable that happened to someone who once made me very happy'. Speaking about [...] "Anemophobia", he said; 'the title of this song means a fear of wind, which I have, but the song on the whole though is about anxiety. ...This song was written when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> lowest point, I genuinely believed I was dying. ...The song is also about how lost I felt and still feel and how most days I don't feel like myself any more'. [...] "Fifty Four" [...] is about James' girlfriend. 'She is my only real sense of normality and I owe her more than I can write down in words for that'.|$|E

60|$|Little {{remains to}} <b>be</b> said, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{going to say}} it, if it snows. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> best in these tender scenes of idyllic domesticity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mrs. Cristie; [...] "and {{perhaps you}} have not yet {{reflected}} that my nurse-maid must take care of <b>my</b> baby while <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> meals." ...|$|R
60|$|Nothing had {{happened}} to the crew, that much seemed certain, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> wits' end to account for the Avenger being apparently heading for home.|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I right," [...] I began, [...] "in supposing {{that you}} dreamed {{of me in}} Shetland, as you once before dreamed of me while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> house in Perthshire?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I am so cold--so cold!" [...] Her {{teeth were}} chattering. I was pained at her sad condition, and said despairingly, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> wits' end {{to know what}} to do: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] he said, {{flicking}} his ashes {{out of the}} window. [...] "Who do {{you think}} <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> age? Frederick T. Maitland, or {{the owner of the}} Brougham Building?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish to heavens {{that you}} would, Mr. Holmes. It's my first big chance, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> wit's end. For goodness' sake, {{come down and}} lend me a hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Propose, Mme. la Duchesse," [...] ejaculated {{the unfortunate}} préfet, [...] "I {{have nothing to}} propose! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> wits' end what to do! I came to M. le Comte for advice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Inkosazana, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> work in {{the house}} yonder and I thought that I heard you calling me down here by the seashore, so I came. Is it your {{pleasure}} that I should accompany you home?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> wit's ends what to do, {{whether to}} be silent, or {{to tell her}} of the terrible {{position}} in which her lover was placed; but, even as I hesitated, she, with the quick intuition of a woman, read the doubts which were in my mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay; I {{have never}} seen him," [...] {{answered}} she. [...] "When he was at Rome, {{a year ago in}} the service of the Pope, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> studies in the convent. His father was my father's cousin, so that my kinship is none so near. Why do you ask?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{intend to}} get him the Belle of the Tye. 'Tis the least I can do. For <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> wits' end how to reward him, Dolly. And when are you coming back?" [...] I whispered earnestly, seeing her silent.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll {{tell you}} later. There {{are a few}} details to be worked upon first. Meanwhile, let us trickle to the sea-front and take a sail {{in one of those}} boats. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> best in a boat. I rather fancy Nature {{intended}} me for a Viking.' ...|$|R
60|$|TWELVE {{years have}} passed since the events {{occurred}} which it has been the business of these pages to relate. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> desk; looking idly at all the leaves of writing which my pen has filled, and asking myself if there is more yet to add, before I have done.|$|R
60|$|At half-past nine, I left {{my mother}} to rest after her long journey, and privately quit the house. Before ten, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> post. The night was fine and clear; and the huge shadow of the cathedral marked {{distinctly}} the limits within which I had been bid to wait, on the watch for events.|$|E
6000|$|ISABEL. Please, {{there as}} {{something}} I {{heard you talking}} about, last time, with Miss Mary. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> lessons, but I heard something about nests; and I thought it was birds' nests; and I couldn't help listening; and then, I remember, it was about [...] "nests of quartz in granite." [...] I remember, because I was so disappointed! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Martin did that," [...] she thought, [...] "while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> breakfast. He knew I {{must have}} come through the window, and might {{want to go back}} that way. Oh dear!" [...] she sighed. [...] "But I am sure I can't help it." [...] And so, {{mounting}} from the stool to the window-sill, she entered her room.|$|E
60|$|JILL. It's ridiculous, Dodo; you'd think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mother <b>at</b> <b>my</b> age.|$|R
60|$|PATTY (closing curtains). <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not gazing <b>at</b> them, ma'am; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> gazing <b>at</b> <b>my</b> sweetheart.|$|R
60|$|Late that evening, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{surprised}} <b>at</b> <b>my</b> lodgings by a {{visit from}} Mr. Bruff.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> wits' end I {{remembered the}} lock of hair--all {{that remains to}} us of her," [...] and Leo touched his breast. [...] "I drew it out and {{compared}} it with the Khania's, and {{at the sight of}} it she became quite different, jealous, I suppose, for it is longer than hers, and not in the least like.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> wit's end, and {{the young}} ladies saw it. They all {{surrounded}} my unmanageable sitter, and appealed to her compassion for me. [...] "Certainly!" [...] said mademoiselle, expressing astonishment by flinging up both her hands with all the fingers spread out in the air. [...] "But why apostrophize me thus? I am here, I am ready, I am {{at the service of}} this skillful artist. Why apostrophize me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! {{do you not}} guess why it is generous? Then look at {{yourself}} in the glass, and you will see. I used to have some pretension to good looks, but I could never have stood beside you {{at the best of}} times, and now---- Your mother, even when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> best, always killed me if I was {{in the same room with}} her, and you are even handsomer than your mother." ...|$|E
60|$|I ate because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ravenously hungry, {{but also}} because, while eating, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> better <b>at</b> <b>my</b> ease.|$|R
6000|$|I {{shook my}} head. [...] "That," [...] I said, [...] "is the crux. Van Helsing is simply frantic about it, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> wits' end. <b>I</b> can't even hazard a guess. There {{has been a}} series of little {{circumstances}} which have thrown out all our calculations as to Lucy being properly watched. But these shall not occur again. Here we stay until all be well, or ill." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{probably}} haven't played {{too poor}} {{the last couple}} of weeks but I certainly don't think <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> best." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> wit's end {{to account}} for her strange actions, and that Thuvia, too, had turned against her father seemed incredible. Could it be that my {{incomparable}} princess still clung to the hideous faith from which I had rescued her world? Could it be that she looked upon me with loathing and contempt because I had returned from the Valley Dor, or because I had desecrated the temples and persons of the Holy Therns? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Love and war indeed!" [...] he said, {{looking at}} me gravely, but showing no sign of surprise, for it {{appeared}} that he was already acquainted with our secret. This was not wonderful, for he informed me afterwards that during my delirium I had done nothing except rave of Marie in the most endearing terms. Also Marie herself, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> worst, had burst into tears before {{him and told him}} straight out that she loved me.|$|E
60|$|How {{she came}} there I did {{not at the}} moment trouble to reflect. She was there. That was the hideous fact that made me doubt the sight of my own eyes, made me {{conceive}} almost that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> disordered visions again, the fruit of too much brooding. I felt {{as if all the}} blood were being exhausted from my heart, as if my limbs would refuse their office, and I leaned for support against the terminal of the balustrade by which I stood.|$|E
60|$|GREAT-HEART. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> Lord's commandment; if He shall allot {{me to be}} {{your guide}} quite through, I will willingly wait upon you. But here you failed at first; for, when He bid me come thus far with you, then you should have begged me of Him to have gone quite through with you, and He would have granted your request. However, at present, I must withdraw; and so, good Christiana, Mercy, and my brave children, Adieu.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> still <b>at</b> <b>my</b> thoughts, still pondering {{this most}} perplexing situation, the hostess {{standing}} silent by the door, when suddenly Madonna Paola spoke.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have had}} the long-contemplated talk with Forster about the play, and write to assure you that <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> delighted {{to come down to}} Knebworth and do Bobadil, or {{anything}} else, provided it would suit your convenience to hold the great dramatic festival in the last week of October. The concluding number of [...] "Copperfield" [...] will prevent me from leaving here until Saturday, the 26th of that month. If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> own disposal, <b>I</b> hope I need not say <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> <b>at</b> yours.|$|R
