5|$|In 1991, it was {{estimated}} that 159 resident and 23 migratory species were endangered or vulnerable due to forest clearance, illegal logging, hunting and habitat degradation, especially in the lowlands. The species most affected are large water birds whose wetland habitat <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> lost to agriculture, and forest species, as deforestation for agriculture and logging have removed and degraded portions of the woodlands.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Tintin in the Congo came under {{criticism}} for both its perceived racist colonial {{attitude toward the}} Congolese and for its glorification of big-game hunting. Accordingly, attempts were made in Belgium, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States to either ban the work or restrict its availability to children. Critical reception of the work <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> negative, with commentators on The Adventures of Tintin describing {{it as one of}} Hergé's weakest works.|$|E
5|$|It {{originally}} {{started as}} a massive loop around the Chicago area, however it has retained its current, much shorter route ever since 1937. During the 1990s, it {{became the subject of}} much concern for local residents regarding expansion which slowed down any progress for capacity improvement. By the late 2000s, the delays have come and gone and it has emerged as a state route that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> modernized to deal with heavy traffic.|$|E
5|$|M-189 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. It {{serves as the}} continuation of Highway 139 (WIS139) from Wisconsin into Michigan, connecting to US Highway 2 (US2) in Iron River. M-189 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> unchanged since being designated in the 1930s, although a new bridge over the Brule River at the state line was built in 1988.|$|E

5|$|M-67 is an {{original}} state trunkline {{dating back to}} 1919. Its routing <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> unchanged since designation. The southern terminus has been moved once, but the northern terminus has remained in the same location since 1919. US41 was rerouted in the Trenary area to run west of town in late 1937 and 1938. M-67 was extended westerly along a former portion of US41 to connect to the new highway on {{the south end of}} M-67. The highway was fully paved {{at the end of the}} 1950s.|$|E
5|$|M-73 was {{designated}} by July 1, 1919, {{along with the}} rest of the initial state trunkline highway system. In 1937, the highway was completely hard-surfaced for the first time. Its routing <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> unchanged since designation. The original bridge over the Brule River was built in 1922. In a joint project with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT), MDOT funded a replacement in 2003. WisDOT supervised construction of the new span in a project that ran between July 14 and November 4, 2003.|$|E

Interestingly, young female members of the family are depicted similarly in play activities, but nevertheless tend to be more likely shown in activities related to chores and child-care. In addition, the image of the grandparent <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> nonexistent in advertising.|$|E

5|$|St Andrew's Castle was an {{artillery}} fort constructed by Henry VIII near Hamble-le-Rice, Hampshire, between 1542 and 1543. It formed {{part of the}} King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended Southampton Water near the Solent. St Andrew's comprised a keep and a gun platform, protected by a moat. The castle was decommissioned in 1642 during the English Civil War and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> destroyed through coastal erosion.|$|E
5|$|The country's fallen {{of the two}} World Wars {{today have}} no {{official}} commemoration, either in Zimbabwe or overseas. The national war memorial obelisk still stands, but the relief sculptures and inscriptions have been removed.

5|$|Extremely {{sensitive}} to dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi, Banksia coccinea is an indicator species {{for the presence}} of the disease. There is no known means of eradicating dieback. Much of the Stirling Range National Park is infested, though Fitzgerald River National Park <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> spared. Applying phosphite to infested areas has been shown to reduce the mortality rates to around 50%. B. coccinea has shown some symptoms of toxicity to application of phosphite, with some patchy necrosis of leaves, but the plant's uptake of the compound is somewhat lower compared with uptake by other shrub species. Unusually, the symptoms {{do not appear to be}} proportional to exposure levels.|$|E

5|$|Historically {{influenced}} by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. However, {{since the late}} 19th century the judicial system <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a civil code based on {{a draft of the}} German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch; with the code remaining in effect with post–World War II modifications. Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature and has the rubber stamp of the Emperor. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.|$|E
5|$|Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Kīlauea {{was created}} as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's {{underlying}} mantle.
