5|$|At Christchurch, he {{reduced the}} number of canons serving the church from 25 to 13, through not {{replacing}} clerks who died. Ranulf kept the revenues that would have gone to the missing canons and used it to rebuild the church. Some medieval sources claim that <b>in</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the church at Twynham, he not only demolished the church he was replacing, but nine others that were nearby.|$|E
5|$|The Inter-American Development Bank {{approved}} $197.4million {{in loans}} in 1998, {{most of which}} due to Hurricane Mitch. The loans were to assist <b>in</b> <b>rebuilding</b> damaged infrastructure, including for water systems, transportation, and houses. Various countries provided nearly $2.8billion to the country in aid, which limited the annual debt following the hurricane's damage. The foreign aid due to the storm largely ended by 2003.|$|E
5|$|Australian and United States air units {{began their}} pre-invasion attacks on north Borneo in late May. The first {{attack on the}} Brunei Bay area took place on 3 May, and {{included}} a raid targeting the town of Victoria on Labuan. A large number of further attacks were conducted to suppress Japanese airfields and other facilities throughout north-western and north-eastern Borneo. The plans for the invasion of Brunei Bay had specified that the landings would be supported by aircraft based at Tarakan, but delays <b>in</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the airfield there rendered this impossible and reduced {{the scale of the}} pre-invasion bombardment.|$|E

5|$|Avant-garde {{musician}} Pierre Schaeffer led a 498-member French {{rescue team}} {{to look for}} survivors in Leninakan, and worked there until all foreign personnel were asked to leave after the plan to bulldoze {{what was left of}} the ruins was formulated. The total number of volunteer rescue personnel in Leninakan totalled 2,000, with teams from Austria, Canada, Switzerland, the United States and Yugoslavia. Nikolai Ryzhkov, the then Chairman of the Council of Ministers, was awarded the National Hero of Armenia for his work <b>in</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the city following the earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Negus {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists, helping to {{establish}} his speciality as a discipline within the newly formed National Health Service. He was a member of numerous international and national otolaryngology organisations, and presided over the Fourth International Congress of Otolaryngology in London in 1949. In this period of his career following the Second World War he also worked on the anatomy of the paranasal sinuses, and played a key role <b>in</b> <b>rebuilding</b> and establishing collections of animal dissections used by comparative anatomists.|$|E
5|$|After his cathedral {{church was}} burned down in 1114, Luffa managed to secure King Henry I's {{financial}} help <b>in</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the church. Besides the rebuilding, Luffa built a Lady chapel, which still remains. Other work still extant {{in the cathedral}} are the arcades, the exteriors of the clerestory and those galleries that are unvaulted. The art historian George Zarnecki {{has argued that the}} rood screen in the cathedral also dates from Luffa's episcopate. Two panels from this work still survive, and depict the meeting of Jesus with Mary and Martha at Bethany as well as the miracle where Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. The scenes show some resemblance to works in Hildesheim and Cologne, and this resemblance may mean that Luffa was from Germany, or hired sculptors from there.|$|E

5|$|After the Duke of Northumberland's {{attainder}} {{the entire}} Dudley inheritance had disappeared. His sons {{had to start}} from scratch <b>in</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the family fortunes, as they had renounced any rights to their father's former possessions or titles when their own attainders had been lifted in January 1558. Robert Dudley financed the lifestyle expected of a royal favourite by large loans from City of London merchants until in April 1560 Elizabeth granted him his first export licence, worth £6,000 p.a. He also received some of his father's lands, but since he was not the family heir {{it was a matter of}} some difficulty to find a suitable estate for his intended peerage. In June 1563 the Queen granted him Kenilworth Manor, Castle, and Park, together with the lordships of Denbigh and Chirk in North Wales. Other grants were to follow. Eventually, Leicester and his elder brother Ambrose, Earl of Warwick, came to preside over the greatest aristocratic interest in the West Midlands and North Wales.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the revolt, Treblinka II {{continued}} to function and remained a top priority for the SS for another year. Stangl met the head of Operation Reinhard, Odilo Globocnik, and inspector Christian Wirth in Lublin, and decided not to draft a report, as no native Germans had died putting down the revolt. Stangl wanted to rebuild the camp, but Globocnik told him it would be closed down shortly and Stangl would be transferred to Trieste to help fight the partisans there. The Nazi high command may have felt that Stangl, Globocnik, Wirth, and other Reinhard personnel knew too much and wanted to dispose of them by sending them to the front. With almost all the Jews from the German ghettos (established in Poland) killed, {{there would have been}} little point <b>in</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the facility. Auschwitz had enough capacity to fulfil the Nazis' remaining extermination needs, rendering Treblinka redundant.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, food and medical supplies rapidly diminished. After the storm dissipated, doctors and nurses traveled to the city to assist in {{the aftermath}}, while trains carried food and water. A train from Monterrey to Tampico carried food, medicine, and soldiers to assist <b>in</b> <b>rebuilding,</b> but was delayed by ongoing flooding. Military planes were utilized to transport aid. Martial law was declared in Tampico following the storm, and officials imposed a 7 p.m. curfew. Uninjured citizens helped clear the roads. President Abelardo L. Rodríguez asked the governors of the Mexican states to send aid and for residents to send money to the Bank of Mexico. Following the storm, residents overcrowded the buildings that remained standing in Tampico.|$|E

5|$|The fate of L'Oiseau Blanc is {{occasionally}} {{mentioned in}} films. The 1999 made-for-TV Canadian film Restless Spirits, a children's film with the alternate title Dead Aviators, uses {{the mystery of}} Nungesser and Coli's disappearance as the key plot device. A young girl, who struggles with her pilot father's death in an aircraft crash years before, visits her grandmother in Newfoundland. While there, she encounters the ghosts of Nungesser and Coli, whose restless spirits constantly relive their own unheralded 1927 crash in a nearby pond. The girl decides to help the pair {{move on to the}} afterlife by assisting them <b>in</b> <b>rebuilding</b> their aircraft and completing their flight so they may be released and, by doing so, works through her own emotional distress over her father's test flight death. And in the opening montage of the 2005 film Sahara, based on Cussler's novel, a French newspaper article is displayed reporting a fictional story of NUMA finding the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} {{large numbers of}} United Nations troops stationed in the DRC.

The UN and foreign military aid missions, the most prominent being EUSEC RD Congo, are attempting to assist the Congolese <b>in</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the armed forces, with major efforts being made in trying to assure regular payment of salaries to armed forces personnel and also in military justice. Retired Canadian Lieutenant General Marc Caron also served for a time as Security Sector Reform advisor {{to the head of}} MONUC.|$|E
5|$|As a builder, Hugh {{built the}} New Bridge, now Elvet Bridge, in Durham, the second stone {{bridge in the}} town. Hugh also oversaw work on Durham Cathedral, decorating the inside with marble, {{installing}} stained glass windows, putting in a shrine for the bones of Bede, and building the Galilee Chapel on {{the west end of}} the cathedral. Originally, Puiset had planned to put in a Lady Chapel {{on the east side of}} the cathedral, but the ground was unsuitable, and instead work began on the Galilee Chapel on the west side of the cathedral. The Galilee Chapel is unusual in that it has five aisles, and quatrefoil, or four lobed, piers. A model for the chapel may have been the work being done on York Minster <b>in</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the choir. The current Norman doorway and the gallery that is above the doorway in Durham Castle were also the work of Hugh, which was part of a hall built in the bailey of the castle. Along with the king of Scots, he built the first bridge over the River Tweed at Berwick. He also rebuilt Norham Castle, replacing the previous buildings built by Ranulf Flambard, an earlier bishop, with a stone castle.|$|E

Some companies implemented policies of retaining all of the hourly workers who had previously worked at destroyed facilities with plans to utilize them <b>in</b> the <b>rebuilding.</b> <b>In</b> all, the expenditures for industrial reconstruction were estimated to have been approximately $100 million ($ in today's terms).|$|R
5|$|Further funds {{came from}} the United States Agency for International Development, which offered US$25,000 by mid-January. The French Polynesian {{assembly}} in Tahiti also provided US$770,000 worth of relief supplies and aid. The main industry of Tonga, tourism, was devastated by the storm as no tourists were allowed {{to travel to the}} region for at least two weeks after Waka's passage. The Government of Tonga requested a total of US$39.2million in international aid, most of which was dedicated to rehabilitation of infrastructure. Medical supplies and personnel were later deployed by the World Health Organization. In early March, a relief fund based on donations was set up by the United Methodist Committee on Relief to provide US$210,000 for 30 families impacted by the storm. About 180 people were given assistance <b>in</b> <b>rebuilding</b> their homes by the Church World Service later that month. As food shortages became severe in April, emergency supplies were sent to the outlying Niuas islands of Tonga. In May, US$5.85million was approved for emergency funds by the World Bank to assist in infrastructural rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|The poor {{performance}} of Zaire's military during Shaba I gave evidence of chronic weaknesses (which extend to this day). One {{problem was that}} some of the Zairian soldiers in the area had not received pay for extended periods. Senior officers often kept the money intended for the soldiers, typifying a generally disreputable and inept senior leadership in the FAZ. As a result, many soldiers simply deserted rather than fight. Others stayed with their units but were ineffective. During the months following the Shaba invasion, Mobutu sought solutions to the military problems that had contributed to the army's dismal performance. He implemented sweeping reforms of the command structure, including wholesale firings of high-ranking officers. He merged the military general staff with his own presidential staff and appointed himself chief of staff again, in addition to the positions of minister of defence and supreme commander that he already held. He also redeployed his forces throughout the country instead of keeping them close to Kinshasa, as had previously been the case. The Kamanyola Division, at the time considered the army's best formation, and considered the president's own, was assigned permanently to Shaba. In addition to these changes, the army's strength was reduced by 25 percent. Also, Zaire's allies provided a large influx of military equipment, and Belgian, French, and American advisers assisted <b>in</b> <b>rebuilding</b> and retraining the force.|$|E
