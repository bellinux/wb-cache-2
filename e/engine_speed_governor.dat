50|$|The <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>governor</b> is used {{to prevent}} the engine from over-speeding. It has the {{capability}} of disregarding the FCU control. It does this by use of a diaphragm which senses the engine speed {{in terms of the}} centrifugal pressure caused by the rotating rotor of the pump.

40|$|The q-Markov COVariance Equivalent Realization (q-Markov Cover) {{method for}} {{identification}} uses either pulse, white noise or PRBS (Pseudo-Random Binary Signal) as test excitation.

50|$|If {{the machine}} is under load and still running too slowly, the cam {{continues}} to stay inserted and makes the engine fire repeatedly for each ignition cycle.

5000|$|The {{first version}} was {{produced}} as the R22, {{followed by the}} R22 HP, R22 Alpha, R22 Beta, and R22 Beta II. Superficially, the aircraft appear similar. The R22 HP was fitted with a 160 bhp Lycoming O-320-B2C engine, an increase of [...] over the original R22. The steel tube frame on the R22 Alpha was modified by extending the aft landing gear mounting points, giving the ship a slightly nose-down attitude {{on the ground and}} better matching of the skids to the ground in a low altitude hover with two people on board. The R22 Beta added an <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>governor</b> (optional), rotor brake, and auxiliary fuel tank (optional). The battery was moved from below the instrument cluster to the engine compartment for better balance. The R22 has been offered as an instrument trainer version, with optional fixed floats as the R22 Mariner, and other special configurations for police work, electronic news gathering, and so on. The R22 Beta II received a larger Lycoming O-360 engine de-rated for sea level operation. It allows greater altitudes for hovering in and out of ground effect (HIGE/HOGE). The R22 Beta II also made the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>governor</b> standard and included a carburetor heat assist which correlates adding carburetor heat with decrease in collective control. Only the basic skid style is currently being sold.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{traditional}} PID control {{effect is}} not ideal when the controlled object is nonlinear and contains variable parameters. In order to adapt marine diesel engines to variable working conditions, the fuzzy-PID control method was proposed {{to be used}} in the speed control system of marine diesel engine to realize online adjustment of PID parameters. The composition of marine diesel engine speed control system was introduced, and the design of fuzzy–PID controller was analyzed in detail. The fuzzy-PID diesel <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>governor</b> was simulated through MATLAB. The simulation results show that fuzzy-PID can improve the system dynamic performance, reduce system oscillation and improve the response speed.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the engine and generator, engine-generators generally include a fuel supply, a constant <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> regulator (<b>governor)</b> and a generator voltage regulator, cooling and exhaust systems, and lubrication system. Units larger than about 1 kW rating often have a battery and electric starter motor; very large units may start with compressed air either to an air driven starter motor or introduced directly to the engine cylinders to initiate engine rotation. Standby power generating units often include an automatic starting system and a transfer switch to disconnect the load from the utility power source {{when there is a}} power failure and connect it to the generator.|$|R
2500|$|In older designs, {{the prime}} mover's {{governor}} and a companion device, the load regulator, {{play a central}} role in the control system. The governor has two external inputs: requested <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> determined by the engine driver's throttle setting, and actual <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> (feedback). The <b>governor</b> has two external control outputs: fuel injector setting, which determines the engine fuel rate, and load regulator position, which affects main generator excitation. [...] The governor also incorporates a separate overspeed protective mechanism that will immediately cut off the fuel supply to the injectors and sound an alarm in the cab in the event the prime mover exceeds a defined RPM. [...] Not all of these inputs and outputs are necessarily electrical.|$|R

The engine was warmed up for 30  min before the 90  min driving experiment through which the engine driving characteristics and exhaust elements were measured.

Since the experimental <b>engine</b> had a <b>speed</b> <b>governor,</b> the <b>speed</b> setting was adjusted to the full so that the rated revolution per minute of the crank shaft could be maintained {{to the level of}} 3600  rpm, with the load of the dynamometer manually controlled. The <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> was measured by means of the revolution indicator TDP- 3321 A-E (Coco Research Co.). The torque at the cam shaft of the engine was measured by means of the dynamometer. For the measurement of exhaust temperature, O 2, CO 2, NO, NO 2 and NOx, HT- 2300 (HODAKA Co.) was utilized.|$|R
40|$|Diesel {{generating}} set load acceptance performance has deteriorated {{in recent years}} due {{to a number of}} influencing factors. Market forces have demanded that a higher power output is achieved for a given engine displacement, whilst global concern and awareness of climate change has led to the introduction of increasingly stringent emissions legislation. In order to provide satisfactory load acceptance performance, whilst maintaining compliance with the growing restrictions placed on operation, more sophisticated control and protection features are required than would be provided with the traditional standby diesel gen-set package. Presently, diesel gen-set control involves limited interaction between the automatic. voltage regulator (AVR) and <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>governor,</b> causing issues to arise due to the absence of a co-ordinated control scheme. For example, {{in the event of a}} large real power load application, a fast responding AVR can cause excessive engine speed deviation, which may be unacceptable in some applications. The problem is further exacerbated by the introduction of fuel limiting as a method of achieving emissions compliance, restricting the action of the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>governor</b> during a transient. This has prompted the research to investigate integration of the various components of a modern diesel gen-set control system. A co-ordinated control approach, in which the AVR aids transient engine speed recovery, has therefore been developed. Testing and evaluation of the integrated diesel gen-set control system was conducted on diesel gen-sets in the Queen's University of Belfast test facility. A number of different integrated control configurations were evaluated to determine the available ifTIprovement in diesel gen set load acceptance performance. The thesis presents results showing that, by utilising a co-ordinated control strategy, a significant overall improvement in the maximum initial load application is achieved, thus meeting market expectation whilst remaining fully emissions compliant.

40|$|Abstract — A diesel {{generator}} set (genset) {{refers to a}} diesel engine powered electrical alternator. Controls are needed to regulate the electrical output at the nominal voltage (120 V RMS) and frequency (60 Hz) despite variation in the electrical loads. In this paper, a system model for the genset is developed. A grey-box system model that considers known physical dependence and empirical identification of unknown effects is proposed. The system model structure is validated and the unknown parameters and effects are identified experimentally. Specifically, the standard proportional relationship between alternator speed and voltage {{is found to be}} valid with an experimentally determined dependence on the field current; the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>governor</b> is found to be a first order controller; the effect of the back torque from the alternator on the speed dynamics is found to be consistent with the alternator and governor model. The system identification procedure is designed {{so that it can be}} easily applied to various units on the field autonomously or by a service personnel- for example for tuning controllers...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{dynamics}} of a small autonomous system, comprising a diesel generator and a wind turbine, are investigated. The analysis is performed both in the frequency and time domain, using simplified models of the system components and {{taking into account the}} diesel <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>governor</b> and the wind turbine pitch controller (for pitch regulated machines). The investigation is extended to include different types of wind turbines, equipped with induction or synchronous generator and using pitch or stall regulation, as well as operation of the wind turbine in an autonomous or infinite system The objective is to determine the main factors affecting the behaviour of the system and to illustrate the effect of the speed governor and pitch controller settings on the expected performance. Particular emphasis is placed on identifying the main modes of the system and determining their dependence on the controllers' parameters. A comparative assessment of the dynamic characteristics of different types of wind turbines is also included and the operation of the wind turbine in a small system and against an infinite bus is addressed and discussed.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to the BESS and DL, the DG possesses a built-in frequency regulator. The <b>speed</b> <b>governor</b> of the diesel engine is able to provide frequency regulation by maintaining the diesel <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> at nominal [25]. Hence, {{the design of a}} frequency controller for the DG is not required. However, in order to improve the system performance, an engine controller has been designed to operate the diesel engine according to the system needs.|$|R
50|$|Electronic: a {{servo motor}} {{is linked to}} the {{throttle}} and controlled by an electronic module that senses <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> by counting electrical pulses emitted by the ignition system or a magnetic pickup. The frequency of these pulses varies directly with <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> allowing the control module to apply a proportional voltage to the servo to regulate <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> Due to their sensitivity and rapid response to <b>speed</b> changes, electronic <b>governors</b> are often fitted to engine-driven generators designed to power computer hardware, as the generator's output frequency must be held within narrow limits to avoid malfunction.|$|R
5000|$|The D-400 series engine or the Iron Horse {{engine was}} a {{light-duty}} two-stroke engine used for powering lawnmowers {{produced in the}} 1960s to the early 1980s. D-400 engines were single-cylinder engines designed and manufactured by the Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC; Johnson and Evinrude) for Lawn-Boy and Masport. The D-400 engines displaced 109 cc, generated 2.61 kW of power, and operated {{in the range of}} 2400-3300 RPM. The engines have a distinctive rectangular cowling that has created a nickname of Brick-top mowers. Another distinctive feature is the two-finger vertical recoil starter. The kidney-shaped muffler and exhaust unit is mounted beneath the mowers' deck and gives the engine a small, low profile design when compared to the newer and more powerful lawnmower engines. The ignition system employs a magneto, points, and a condenser (capacitor) set-up with an unusual spark-advance system which utilised a weight on the crankshaft to adjust the spark-advance amount depending on <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> The sprung <b>governor</b> was also unusual with a throw-yoke which operated under the flywheel and was linked to the throttle. The carburettor was a float design and fed into a pair of reed valves.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine is}} {{designed}} to operate at a constant speed, no matter the thrust output—a characteristic permitted by the Astafan's use of precise fuel metering and fan blade pitch adjustment. To control the engine, the pilot first sets the speed lever, which adjusts fuel flow {{in proportion to the}} selected <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> Then the pilot moves the thrust lever (analogous to a throttle), actuating the fan pitch piston by way of a mechanical linkage and hydraulic valve, and varying the blade pitch. In response, the <b>speed</b> <b>governor</b> holds <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> steady by adjusting fuel delivery to the combustor. The control system also monitors turbine temperature and adjusts blade pitch (and therefore engine load) to maintain it within the preferred range of 350 °C to 450 °C. Additionally, the system automatically protects against excessive fuel delivery or unusual changes in blade pitch. Using the thrust lever, pilots can start an Astafan in fine pitch (for minimal resistive torque), select takeoff (coarse) pitch, feather the fan, or even reverse the fan pitch in flight (with the fan providing reverse thrust in lieu of conventional reversers).|$|R
50|$|The single gear-driven {{camshaft}} {{is arranged}} {{so that each}} lobe operates the exhaust valves {{on a pair of}} cylinders. Roller cam followers are used. In the middle of the camshaft is a <b>speed</b> <b>governor.</b> The governor causes lengthwise movement of the camshaft, and the cam-lobes are slightly widened to allow for this. The speed-regulation caused by the governor is set by a lever on the steering column and the same mechanism advances the spark with increased <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> The operation of the governor is overridden by the foot throttle (either slower or faster - the pedal is of a type allowing it to be raised or depressed), but for normal running the governor offers an early form of cruise control.|$|R
30|$|The {{diesel engine}} {{provides}} frequency regulation through the <b>speed</b> <b>governor.</b> Thus, {{in this study}} a controller {{has been designed to}} operate the diesel <b>engine</b> reference <b>speed</b> according to the system needs. The designed engine controller anticipates the commissioning of the DG and prepares the diesel engine for commissioning by running in stand-by mode. The diesel engine runs in stand-by mode if: 1) the SOC is close to the empty limit, 2) P BESS is close to the instantaneous supply limit.|$|R

50|$|Pneumatic: the {{governor}} mechanism detects air {{flow from the}} flywheel blower used to cool an air-cooled engine. The typical design includes an air vane mounted inside the engine's blower housing and linked to the carburetor's throttle shaft. A spring pulls the throttle open and, as the <b>engine</b> gains <b>speed,</b> increased air flow from the blower forces the vane back against the spring, partially closing the throttle. Eventually a point of equilibrium will be reached and the engine will run at a relatively constant <b>speed.</b> Pneumatic <b>governors</b> are simple in design and inexpensive to produce. However, they do not regulate <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> very accurately and are affected by air density, as well as external conditions that may influence airflow.|$|R
50|$|At lower <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> the {{position}} of the camshaft is moved so the valves are opened later, as this improves idling quality and smooth power development.As the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> increases, the valves are opened earlier: this enhances torque, reduces fuel consumption and lowers emissions.At high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds,</b> the valves are opened later again, because this allows full power delivery.|$|R

50|$|To {{maximize}} acceleration, the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> of {{an automobile}} {{must be kept}} near that where maximum power is developed. For this reason, vehicles utilize transmissions; as the vehicle's speed increases such that the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> exceeds {{the speed at which}} maximum power is developed, the driver shifts to a higher (numerically lower ratio) gear, which reduces <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and allows continued acceleration.|$|R
5000|$|Overall, reduced <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> {{has benefited}} the sport {{because there is}} more racing, fewer {{accidents}} and breakdowns and racing fans get more value for their time and money invested in watching races. Costs across the board have dropped, and competition has increased. Still, Formula One is very much {{out of step with}} most [...] "mainstream" [...] motorsports where larger dispacement engines and lower <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> dominate. When compared to much larger engines producing much higher torque output at far lower <b>engines</b> <b>speeds</b> and powering much heavier vehicles to similar speeds, the diminishing returns of very high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> and small displacements become apparent. And while many other motorsports, such as NASCAR, feature racing with the engines and cars spending the majority of their events at high speeds, Formula One cars spend much less time at full vehicle and <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> and typically the maximum <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> are seen while downshifting going into and exiting corners rather than in [...] "high gear" [...] for lengthy periods of time.|$|R

5000|$|... i-VTEC is {{the acronym}} for {{intelligent}} VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control), an evolution of Honda's VTEC engine. The i-VTEC engine works by controlling {{the timing and}} lifting of the camshafts depending on <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> The valves open a small amount during low <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to achieve maximum fuel efficiency. The valves will open wider at higher <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to achieve higher performance.|$|R
40|$|The <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} signals in the engine management system of a combustion engine. The signal is used to control the fuel injection, estimate the engine torque, and to generate reference values. Combustions in the cylinders result in the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> oscillating around a momentary average, and many applications are depending on stable estimates of this average <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and the average acceleration. This thesis provides a signal model based method to estimate the momentary average <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and acceleration. The estimation of momentary average <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> and acceleration is complicated by imperfections in the process of measuring the <b>engine</b> <b>speed.</b> Limited accuracy in the measurements causes quantization distortion in the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> signal. The effects of these errors are investigated and quantified. A signal model representing the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> is developed and used to estimate the momentary average and acceleration using a Kalman filter. The regular Kalman filter cannot provide estimates with low noise levels at steady state and at the same time be fast enough to track the signal during transient behavior. This problem is overcome by extending the Kalman filter with a change detection algorithm. While this signal model based method gives a satisfying result, it is computationally complex. To evaluate its performance, it is compared to a moving average FIR filter, which is computationally less expensive but does not succeed as well as the signal model based method in filtering out all oscillations...|$|R
50|$|The {{device is}} {{generally}} used over {{a range of}} <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> to obtain power and torque curves for the engine, since there is a non-linear relationship between torque and <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> for most <b>engine</b> types.|$|R
5000|$|Engine builders, {{engineers}} and tuners read dynamometer results as {{a map of}} engine performance rather than a chart of data points. Since horsepower is calculated from torque and <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> {{at the point where}} torque output begins to drop and cannot be offset by increased <b>engine</b> <b>speed,</b> the <b>engine</b> is becoming less efficient and the horsepower output falls as a result. Beyond peak horsepower <b>speed,</b> additional <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> only wastes fuel and increases wear and tear on the engine and other powertrain components. Horsepower and high <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> are grossly overestimated as indicators of performance in most applications, and high horsepower numbers that are dependent primarily upon <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> rather than torque output have to be offset by increasing torque via torque-converter design, transmission gearing, differential gearing and tire size so that available torque is used and multiplied most effectively.|$|R
