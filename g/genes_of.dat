5|$|Catalytic RNA {{molecules}} (ribozymes) {{were discovered}} in the early 1980s, leading to a 1989 Nobel award to Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman. In 1990, it was found in Petunia that introduced genes can silence similar <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the plant's own, now {{known to be a}} result of RNA interference.|$|E
5|$|Sequencing of the rbcL and matK {{chloroplast}} <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> Lilium {{and related}} genera confirmed the circumscription {{of the family}} in the sensu stricto usage of Tamura (1998). Chloroplast ndhF gene sequencing also supported Liliaceae monophyly, reuniting the Liliaceae sensu Tamura and Calochortaceae sensu Tamura (see Table 2 & Table 3 below).|$|E
50|$|The <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> {{interest}} directly causes {{production of}} protein(s) or RNA that produce a desired trait or phenotype, whereas markers (a DNA sequence or the morphological or biochemical markers produced {{due to that}} DNA) are genetically linked to the <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest. The <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest and the marker tend to move together during segregation of gametes due to their proximity on the same chromosome and concomitant reduction in recombination (chromosome crossover events) between the marker and <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest. For some traits, the <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest has been discovered {{and the presence of}} desirable alleles can be directly assayed {{with a high level of}} confidence. However, if the <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest is not known, markers linked to the <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest can still be used to select for individuals with desirable alleles <b>of</b> the <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest. When markers are used there may be some inaccurate results due to inaccurate tests for the marker. There also can be false positive results when markers are used, due to recombination between the marker <b>of</b> interest and <b>gene</b> (or QTL). A perfect marker would elicit no false positive results. The term 'perfect marker' is sometimes used when tests are performed to detect a SNP or other DNA polymorphism in the <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest, if that SNP or other polymorphism is the direct cause of the trait of interest. The term 'marker' is still appropriate to use when directly assaying the <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest, because the test of genotype is an indirect test of the trait or phenotype of interest.|$|R
50|$|Look for flies {{expressing the}} {{reporter}} gene. These carry the inserted <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest, so can be investigated {{to determine the}} phenotype due to the <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest.|$|R
50|$|The <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> {{interest}} is {{the target of the}} mosaic analysis. Cells lacking the extrachromosomal array also lack the functional <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest. Cells which develop normally without the array do not require the <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest for normal function. Cells which do not develop normally are said to require the gene. In this way, those cell lineages which require a specific gene can be identified.|$|R
5|$|A {{chemical}} tracer is 24-isopropylcholestane, {{which is a}} stable derivative of 24-isopropylcholesterol, which {{is said to be}} produced by demosponges but not by eumetazoans ("true animals", i.e. cnidarians and bilaterians). Since choanoflagellates are thought to be animals' closest single-celled relatives, a team of scientists examined the biochemistry and <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> one choanoflagellate species. They concluded that this species could not produce 24-isopropylcholesterol but that investigation of a wider range of choanoflagellates would be necessary in order to prove that the fossil 24-isopropylcholestane could only have been produced by demosponges.|$|E
5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} {{refers to the}} transfer of genetic material through a mechanism other than reproduction. This mechanism is a common source of new genes in prokaryotes, sometimes thought to contribute more to genetic variation than gene duplication. It is a common means of spreading antibiotic resistance, virulence, and adaptive metabolic functions. Although horizontal {{gene transfer}} is rare in eukaryotes, likely examples have been identified of protist and alga genomes containing <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> bacterial origin.|$|E
30|$|As {{screening}} probes, the DNA {{fragments of}} KS, ALS and FkbH-like protein were firstly amplified from S. griseus DSM 2608 chromosomal DNA. The gene amplification yielded DNA fragments having about 590 bp for KS gene, 520 bp for ALS gene and 600 bp for FkbH-like protein gene, respectively (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). The amplified KS probe had a highly similar nucleotide sequence over 95 % with TrdAIII <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> Streptomyces sp. SCSIO 1666 (GenBank No. HQ 852227.1) and TamAIII <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> Streptomyces sp. 307 – 9 (GenBank No. GU 385216.1). The amplified ALS probe also showed the high homology around 92 % in nucleotide sequences with bfmK <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> Kitasatospora setae KM- 6054 (GenBank No. NC_ 016109.1) and bafZ <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> S. lohii (GenBank No. GU 390405.1). The amplified probe for FkbH-like protein fragment also exhibited the high homology over 90 % in nucleotide sequences with bfmE <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> K. setae KM- 6054 (GenBank No. NC_ 016109.1) and bafE <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> S. lohii (GenBank No. GU 390405.1).|$|R
30|$|As a result, 32 {{new drug}} {{candidates}} of old drugs can be found. Among them, three drug candidates for three genes {{which has no}} drugs in the KEGG database and one drug candidate for one gene which has some drugs in the KEGG database are discovered as a therapeutic agent. The former three new drug candidates are “hydroxyurea” for NBN <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> primary immunodeficiency or congenital disorder of DNA repair systems, “probucol” for COG 1 <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> inherited metabolic disease, and “pyridoxine” for SLC 25 A 38 <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> hematologic disease.

5|$|In asexual organisms, {{genes are}} {{inherited}} together, or linked, as they cannot mix with <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> other organisms during reproduction. In contrast, {{the offspring of}} sexual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents' chromosomes that are produced through independent assortment. In a related process called homologous recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes. Recombination and reassortment do not alter allele frequencies, but instead change which alleles are associated with each other, producing offspring with new combinations of alleles. Sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of evolution.|$|E
5|$|RNAi is a {{valuable}} research tool, both in cell culture and in living organisms, because synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can selectively and robustly induce suppression of specific <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> interest. RNAi {{may be used for}} large-scale screens that systematically shut down each gene in the cell, which can help to identify the components necessary for a particular cellular process or an event such as cell division. The pathway is also used as a practical tool in biotechnology, medicine and insecticides.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{replicate}} within archaea: {{these are}} double-stranded DNA viruses with unusual and sometimes unique shapes. These viruses {{have been studied}} in most detail in the thermophilic archaea, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Defences against these viruses involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences within archaean genomes {{that are related to}} the <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the viruses. Most archaea have CRISPR–Cas systems as an adaptive defence against viruses. These enable archaea to retain sections of viral DNA, which are then used to target and eliminate subsequent infections by the virus using a process similar to RNA interference.|$|E
40|$|Partial {{sequence}} <b>of</b> the dnaJ <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> Vibrio harveyi, {{which was}} isolated from diseased juvenile Asian seabass, Lates calcarifer was identified. The partial sequence <b>of</b> dnaJ <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> V. harveyi was 447 bp and shared at least 77 % identity at the nucleotide {{level with the}} dnaJ <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> other Vibrios. It was distinct from the dnaJ <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> other Vibrios but was closely related with the dnaJ <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> V. rotiferianus and V. campbellii having at least 90 % nucleotide identity. PCR primers targeting this gene were designed to detect the pathogen in Asian seabass. The assay was specific to V. harveyi and the limit of detection was 100 pg of genomic DNA ml- 1 or 100 fg of bacterial genomic DNA in a PCR reaction. This corresponded to a sensitivity of approximately 20 genome equivalents (GE) of V. harveyi. These {{results indicate that the}} dnaJ gene is a good candidate to develop primers for the PCR assay in detecting V. harveyi in fish...|$|R
50|$|Genetic {{exchange}} between chromosomes can cause cells to become cancerous. Most cases of Ewing's sarcoma (85%) {{are the result}} of a translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22, which fuses the EWS <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> chromosome 22 to the FLI1 <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> chromosome 11.|$|R
40|$|Background: Mutations in the {{polymerase}} (P) <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> hepatitis B virus {{are often}} associated with drug resistance.

Objectives: This study was carried out to detect mutations in P <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> hepatitis B virus isolated from Malaysian HBV carriers. Materials and Methods: A total of 58 sera samples were analyzed by PCR and sequencing, of which the P <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> isolated HBV was successfully amplified and sequenced from 40 samples...|$|R
5|$|TCDD and dioxin-like {{compounds}} act via {{a specific}} receptor {{present in all}} cells: the aryl hydrocarbon (AH) receptor. This receptor is a transcription factor which is involved in expression of genes; in fact {{it has been shown}} that high doses of TCDD either increase or decrease the expression of several hundred genes in rats. <b>Genes</b> <b>of</b> enzymes activating the breakdown of foreign and often toxic compounds are classic examples of such genes. TCDD increases the enzymes breaking down, e.g., carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons such as benzo(a)pyrene.|$|E
5|$|The huia {{appears to}} be a remnant of an early {{expansion}} of passerines in the country of New Zealand, and is the largest of the three members of the family Callaeidae, the New Zealand wattlebirds; the others are the saddleback and the kōkako. The only close relative to the family is the stitchbird; their taxonomic relationships to other birds remain to be determined. A molecular study of the nuclear RAG-1 and c-mos <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the three species within the family proved inconclusive, the data providing most support for either a basally diverging kōkako or huia.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of chromosomes of Azotobacter vinelandii, strain AvOP, is partially determined. This chromosome is a circular DNA molecule which contains 5,342,073 nucleotide pairs and 5,043 <b>genes,</b> <b>of</b> which 4,988 encode proteins. The fraction of guanine + cytosine pairs is 65 mole percent. The number of chromosomes in the cells and the DNA content increases upon aging, {{and in the}} stationary growth phase, cultures may contain more than 100 copies of a chromosome per cell. The original DNA content (one copy) is restored when replanting the culture into a fresh medium. In addition to chromosomal DNA, Azotobacter can contain plasmids.|$|E

40|$|The sfrB <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> Escherichia coli K- 12 and the rfaH <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> Salmonella typhimurium LT 2 are homologous, {{controlling}} {{expression of}} the tra operon of F and the rfa genes for lipopolysaccharide synthesis. We have determined a restriction map of the 19 -kilobase ColE 1 plasmid pLC 14 - 28 which carries the sfrB <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> E. coli. After partial Sau 3 A digestion of pLC 14 - 28, we cloned a 2. 5 -kilobase DNA fragment into the BamHI site of pBR 322 to form pKZ 17. pKZ 17 complemented mutants <b>of</b> the sfrB <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> E. coli and the rfaH <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> S. typhimurium for defects of both the F tra operon and the rfa genes. pKZ 17 in minicells determines an 18 -kilodalton protein not determined by pBR 322. A Tn 5 insertion into the sfrB <b>gene</b> causes loss <b>of</b> complementing activity and loss of the 18 -kilodalton protein in minicells, indicating that this protein is the sfrB gene product.

40|$|The <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> nSH 3 (131 - 205) from c-CRK II was amplified from plasmid pAT 044 1 (a kind {{gift from}} Dr. Patrik Forrer) {{by the two}} oligo nucleotides: #SK 202 TCATATGCAG-GAGGAGGCAGAGTATGTG, and #SK 201, TCGGATCCCTGGTTACCTCCAATCAG. The PCR product was ligated into a vector pHYRSF 49 - 36 after {{digestion}} with NdeI and BamHI, which resulted in pMMRSF 17 {{for the expression of}} H 6 -Smt 3 -nSH 3 -NpuDnaE-IntN 123. pHYRSF 49 - 36 was derived from pHYRSF 1 containing the fragment from pSKDuet 1 digested with NcoI and HindIII and a mutation of SpeI site after the N-terminal His-tag. The <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> yeast ubiquitin-like protein, Smt 3 amplified from S. cerevisiae genome was ligated between SpeI and NdeI sites. Furthermore, the <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> NpuDnaE-IntN 102 was replaced with that of NpuDnaE-IntN 123 using BamHI and HindIII sites, which finally resulted in pHYRSF 49 - 36.

5|$|The white Schnauzer {{is one of}} four color {{varieties}} of the Miniature Schnauzer currently recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.

The controversy rests on the disputed origins of the white variation: whether it was contained within the <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the originally recognized breed, or whether it was the result of subsequent modifications. Since the other two Schnauzer types have never been available in a white variation, and the original German standard never included white as an acceptable color, the AMSC chooses not to recognize white.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of model plants such as the Thale cress, Arabidopsis thaliana, a weedy species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). The genome or hereditary information contained in the <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> this species is encoded by about 135 million base pairs of DNA, forming {{one of the smallest}} genomes among flowering plants. Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000. The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon, has made them important model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of cereals, grasses and monocots generally.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{are genetically}} {{distinct}} from bacteria and eukaryotes, {{with up to}} 15% of the proteins encoded by any one archaeal genome being unique to the domain, although most of these unique genes have no known function. Of {{the remainder of the}} unique proteins that have an identified function, most belong to the Euryarchaea and are involved in methanogenesis. The proteins that archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes share form a common core of cell function, relating mostly to transcription, translation, and nucleotide metabolism. Other characteristic archaeal features are the organization of <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> related function—such as enzymes that catalyze steps in the same metabolic pathway into novel operons, and large differences in tRNA genes and their aminoacyl tRNA synthetases.|$|E

50|$|Other {{systems such}} as the T-REx system by Life Technologies work in a {{different}} fashion. The <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest is flanked by an upstream CMV promoter and two TetO2 sites. Expression <b>of</b> the <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest is repressed by the high affinity binding of TetR homodimers to each TetO2 sequences {{in the absence of}} tetracycline. Introduction of tetracycline results in binding of one tetracycline on each TetR homodimer followed by release of TetO2 by the TetR homodimers. Unbinding of TetR homodimers and TetO2 result in derepression <b>of</b> the <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest.|$|R
5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the viruses.|$|E
5|$|Mallard {{have had}} a long {{relationship}} with humans. Almost all domestic duck breeds derive from the mallard, {{with the exception of}} a few Muscovy breeds. Mallards are generally monogamous while domestic ducks are mostly polygamous. Domestic ducks have no territorial behaviour and are less aggressive than mallards. Domestic ducks are mostly kept for meat, as their eggs have a strong flavor. They were first domesticated in Southeast Asia at least 4000 years ago, during the Neolithic Age, and were also farmed by the Romans in Europe, and the Malays in Asia. It is also common for mallards to mate with domestic ducks and produce hybrid offspring that are fully fertile. Due to this, mallards have been found to be contaminated with the <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the domestic duck.|$|E
5|$|Other Triturus species only meet at narrow zones {{on their}} range borders. Hybridisation does occur {{in several of}} these contact zones, as shown by genetic data and {{intermediate}} forms, but is rare, supporting overall reproductive isolation. Backcrossing and introgression do however occur as shown by mitochondrial DNA analysis. In {{a case study in}} the Netherlands, <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the introduced Italian crested newt were found to introgress into the gene pool of the native northern crested newt. The two marbled newt species can be found in proximity in a narrow area in central Portugal and Spain, but they usually breed in separate ponds, and individuals in that area could be clearly identified as one of the two species. Nevertheless, there is introgression, occurring in both directions at some parts of the contact zone, and only {{in the direction of the}} southern marbled newt where that species had historically replaced the marbled newt (see also above, Glacial refugia and recolonisation).|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} an efficient system of site-directed mutagenesis for the envelope (env) <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1).
