25|$|The impulse of the Moravian Church {{after its}} renewal at Herrnhut was to evangelise. This did not entail {{proselytising}} from other churches. It involved creating societies which would quicken spiritual life within existing Protestant denominations or {{among people who}} were unattached to any church; and taking the Gospel to those, especially in the Danish, Dutch and British colonies, who had never <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E

Phillips {{wanted them to}} immediately record the next song, but Lennon and McCartney could not decide on a song for the B-side of the disc.

500|$|York manager McEwan {{compared}} Donaldson to Paulo Wanchope in September 2006, but following York's 2–0 away defeat against Oxford United {{later that}} month, McEwan criticised Donaldson's selfishness in attack, saying it cost them the match. In late 2006, Donaldson became {{subject of much}} transfer speculation. Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Mick McCarthy watched him in York's 1–0 home victory over Altrincham, in which he scored his 12th goal of the season, on 5 November 2006. He was also watched by Scottish Premier League club Hibernian. In response to this speculation, Donaldson said: [...] "I don't read too much into the speculation. I've <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> and nothing has happened so I will just keep my head down and enjoy my football until a point comes when the manager or board come and tell me they have had an offer they want to consider".|$|E
500|$|The {{one group}} number, [...] "Pure Imagination", {{received}} reviews that touched on the song itself {{as much as}} the performance. Fallon called it [...] "unsettling yet touching" [...] and Poniewozik described it as [...] "odd but perfect". Berk, on the other hand, characterized it as [...] "pure dreck". Benigno felt that while the song was [...] "really quite good", the [...] "stupidity of the scene" [...] it was in detracted from it, resulting in a grade of [...] "B+", while Gonzalez, when she gave it an [...] "A−", said she hadn't been a [...] "huge fan of the cover" [...] when she <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> the show aired, but it grew on her in context. Futterman wrote, [...] "The New Directions break into a restrained, tender take on [...] "Pure Imagination" [...] with lush harmonies on the chorus that's exactly right for the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2012, {{eleventh}} season contestant of American Idol, Hollie Cavanagh, {{covered the}} song. Her performance received mixed reviews from the judges of the show, {{who said that}} she was [...] "a little pitchy" [...] and added that she seemed to be [...] "overthinking" [...] the song. Amy Reiter of Los Angeles Times noted that [...] "her clear, crisp tone, crashed and burned on 'Honesty,' missing notes and losing her way". Laura Prudom of The Huffington Post was mixed about her performance writing, [...] "She was occasionally pitchy on this song, and seemed to be overthinking it in parts and allowing the song to overwhelm her... Unusually, she seemed both nasal and pitchy in the early parts of the performance... her choice of a pantsuit was completely baffling, since it made her look nearer 40 than 20." [...] Later, during an interview, Cavanagh revealed that she had difficulties singing the song because she had never <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E

500|$|Swift {{began work}} on her third studio album Speak Now two years prior to its release in 2010. [...] "Sparks Fly" [...] was written by Swift when she was sixteen years old, prior the release of her eponymous album in 2006. She {{performed}} the song live during several bar shows [...] "of forty and fifty people". A recorded live performance of the song during one of her concerts made its way onto the internet in 2007. The song became a favorite among Swift's fans, leading Swift to rework the song and include it on Speak Now after having so many requested {{for it to be}} included on the album. Of the song, Swift said that: [...] "This is a song I wrote {{a few years ago and}} I have been working on it ever since. It's been awesome to see it change over the years. The fans have <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>before</b> in concert, but there have been some really cool changes that I am very proud of and can't wait for them to hear." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's cover art (known as the 'Screaming Elf') is a {{distorted}} {{photograph of the}} band members, photographed by Kevin Westenberg, above {{a black and white}} upside-down burning forest. Concerning the artwork, Cornell said, [...] "Superunknown relates to birth in a way... Being born or even dying—getting flushed into something that you know nothing about. The hardest thing is to nail down a visual image to put on a title like that. The first thing we thought of was a forest in grey or black. Soundgarden has always been associated with images of flowers and lush colors and this was the opposite. It still seemed organic but it was very dark and cold... I was into those stories as a kid where forests were full of evil and scary things as opposed to being happy gardens that you go camping in." [...] In a 1994 Pulse! magazine interview, Cornell said that the inspiration for the album's title came from his misreading of a video entitled Superclown. He added, [...] "I thought it was a cool title. I'd never <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> <b>before,</b> never saw it before, and it inspired me." [...] The album also saw a limited release on 12" [...] colored vinyl (blue, orange, and clear), as a double-LP in a gatefold sleeve. The album's title 'SUPERUNKNOWN' is sometimes displayed with the [...] "UNKNOWN" [...] as semi upside down and reversed lettering (stylized as [...] "SUPER∩ИKИOWИ").|$|E
2500|$|McCartney's initial {{concern was}} that he had subconsciously plagiarised someone else's work (known as cryptomnesia).

I thought if no one claimed it after a few weeks then I could have it." ...|$|E
