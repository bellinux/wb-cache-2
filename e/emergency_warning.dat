The degree of lighting is mandated by law and also by local custom in most areas, and can vary from a single rotating light on the dashboard or roof, to a setup much like modern police cruisers.

25|$|At 18:35 the DC-4 {{departed}} Vancouver International Airport, Canada on {{a scheduled}} flight to Tokyo; {{it was due}} to stop over at Anchorage Airport in Alaska. The flight was on schedule and reported at the Cape Spencer intersection in British Columbia 90 minutes out from Anchorage; it gave an estimate of 24:00 for Yakutat in Alaska. The weather in the area was heavy rain and icing conditions with a visibility of 500 feet. Nothing further was heard from the aircraft, and at 00:44 an <b>emergency</b> <b>warning</b> was issued when the aircraft was overdue to report. The United States Air Force and Royal Canadian Air Force carried out an extensive search but failed to find any trace of the aircraft or its 37 occupants. The search was finally called off on 31 October 1951.|$|E

2500|$|The fires {{reached the}} urban area at 3pm.

These advisories, accompanied by the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Warning</b> Signal stated that a significant [...] "deterioration" [...] of the fire situation in the ACT had occurred and placed several suburbs on alert to evacuate. As the day continued, these advisories advised the evacuation of several suburbs (also enforced by Police on the ground) and placed most suburbs of Canberra on some level of alert. By now, the fire had reached the fringes of many suburbs, was surrounding Tharwa, and threatened the historic Lanyon Homestead, which was hosting a wedding and protected by only a single fire truck.|$|E
2500|$|Around noon on 25 November, the Pinery {{fire was}} started by an unknown {{ignition}} source in a paddock bordering Plains Road and Port Lorne Road in the lower Mid North wheat-growing locality of Pinery, [...] due north of Adelaide's centre. Shortly after noon, the first alert message for the Pinery fire was issued by the Country fire service, the fire burning west of Avon on Port Lorne Road. The warning was upgraded 10 minutes later to emergency level, with the fire burning in a south-easterly direction and impacting on properties around Mallala. According to a Pinery farmer who spoke to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Landline program, local farmers were [...] "...confronted with two kilometres of 30-foot-high wall of flame." [...] An hour later the <b>emergency</b> <b>warning</b> area was expanded to include Magdala, Pinkerton Plains, Redbanks, Wasleys and Woolsheds as the fire moved in a south-easterly direction, and by 14:30 ACDT (...) the fire was impacting properties in the areas around Gawler, Hewett and Roseworthy.|$|E

At 16:25 ACDT (...) , the area placed under an <b>emergency</b> <b>warning</b> was expanded again to include Dutton, Eudunda, Marrabel and Riverton. A worker at a piggery between Wasleys and Mallala reportedly [...] "...drove 120 kilometres per hour in one direction away from the fire, before seeing the wind swing around and having to double back in the opposite direction." [...] The man, who spoke to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation described [...] "...flames taller than buildings". The members of 3 Country Fire Service brigades were trapped between Hamley Bridge and Tarlee during the wind change and sheltered in their vehicles during a burn over, however there were no injuries.|$|E

30|$|The main {{contribution}} of the proposed cooperative <b>emergency</b> braking <b>warning</b> system delivers drivers a braking warning signal earlier by DSRC communication. Via vehicle-to-vehicle communication, the <b>emergency</b> braking <b>warning</b> signal will be broadcast and the transmission time is much shorter than the human reaction time. Therefore, drivers behind can receive an immediate <b>emergency</b> braking <b>warning</b> while the front vehicle emergency brakes. Since the transmission time is much shorter than the human reaction time, the driver in car C can {{be aware of the}} emergency braking of car A before the driver in car B brakes and its braking light comes on, as shown in Figure  4. Consequently, the early warning mechanism is the concept of the proposed cooperative <b>emergency</b> braking <b>warning</b> system. Now that active safety applications have become mature, cooperative communication technology to achieve improved safety will be the future trend.|$|R

30|$|Safety {{applications}} in vehicular networks {{have been very}} important research works in recent years. This paper proposes an integrated camera sensor and DSRC communication to construct the state of neighbouring cars, which is called the cooperative <b>emergency</b> braking <b>warning</b> system. The proposed system {{is based on the}} relative position instead of the GPS position in order to solve the positioning accuracy problem. Moreover, the system includes a method for reducing the broadcast message to solve the time-critical problem in vehicular networks. The results of performance evaluations show that the proposed system can provide communication-based forward collision <b>warning,</b> <b>emergency</b> braking <b>warning</b> in the same lane and <b>emergency</b> braking <b>warning</b> in neighbouring lanes. Moreover, the system can reduce the message transmission in order to enhance the effectiveness of transmission information in vehicular networks. The proposed system has been implemented to provide a safer driving environment for drivers.|$|R
