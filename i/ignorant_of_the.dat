5|$|A {{manuscript}} normally {{known as}} the Orus Apollo also exists in the Lyon municipal library, where upwards of 2,000 original documents relating to Nostradamus are stored {{under the aegis of}} Michel Chomarat. It is a purported translation of an ancient Greek work on Egyptian hieroglyphs based on later Latin versions, all of them unfortunately <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> true meanings of the ancient Egyptian script, which was not correctly deciphered until Champollion in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Saudi Arabia {{uses the}} bench trial system. Its courts observe few formalities. The country's first {{criminal}} procedure code {{was introduced in}} 2001 and contains provisions borrowed from Egyptian and French law. Human Rights Watch, in a 2008 report, noted that judges were either <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> criminal procedure code or were aware of it but routinely ignored the code.|$|E
5|$|Shivayogi's other {{writings}} {{include a}} scientific encyclopaedia called Vivekachintamani, so well regarded {{that it was}} translated into Marathi language in 1604 and Sanskrit language in 1652 {{and again in the}} 18th century. The writing categorises 1,500 topics based on subject and covers a wide array such as poetics, dance and drama, musicology and erotics. His translation of the Shiva Yoga Pradipika from Sanskrit was done to elucidate the Shaiva philosophy and benefit those <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original language.|$|E

5|$|The book praises Dallaire's {{commitment}} to his peacekeeping mission, but {{is critical of}} MacKenzie, who is depicted as being <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bosnian political situation. In response to Off's portrayal of him, MacKenzie considered suing for libel, but opted not to. The book praises Arbour's efforts at building the legitimacy of International Criminal Tribunals and her efforts in indicting alleged war criminals from the massacres in Rwanda and Bosnia. Through these biographies, the book addresses themes of morality and UN effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|The hero, {{who comes}} from a land beyond Alefgard, is a {{descendant}} of the legendary Erdrick. When the hero arrives, he {{does not appear to}} be a warrior – he arrives without weapons or armor – and is <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation. The populace thinks his claim of the ability to defeat the Dragonlord are preposterous; however, King Lorik sees this ability, which give him hope and he aids the hero on his quest.|$|E
5|$|A luxurious ball {{followed}} the wedding on 20 May. Louis Stanislas found his wife repulsive; she was considered ugly, tedious, and <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> customs {{of the court}} of Versailles. The marriage remained unconsummated for years. Biographers disagree about the reason. The most common theories propose Louis Stanislas' alleged impotence (according to biographer Antonia Fraser) or his unwillingness to sleep with his wife due to her poor personal hygiene. She never brushed her teeth, plucked her eyebrows, or used any perfumes. At {{the time of his}} marriage, Louis Stanislas was obese and waddled instead of walked. He never exercised and continued to eat enormous amounts of food.|$|E
50|$|Gary and Deno reconvened {{the band}} again in 1992 and began touring {{extensively}} {{which resulted in}} the Drunks in Rusty Transits album after which the band was dissolved. Singer Gxist (Gary) later formed Stratford Mercenaries with Steve <b>Ignorant</b> <b>of</b> Crass. <b>The</b> original bass player, Vomit (Vincent Learoyd), went on to form Earth Culture, a neo-pagan band before writing the novel THE LAILA MYTHOLOGY in 2013, collaborating on the book trailer with founder CRASS member Penny Rimbaud.|$|R

25|$|When Gladstone came to {{know him}} in later years, he was {{astonished}} to find that Parnell was <b>ignorant</b> even <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basic facts <b>of</b> Irish history. <b>The</b> romantic vision that characterised Young Ireland and the Fenians escaped him completely.

5|$|Bedřich Smetana {{was born}} as Friedrich Smetana on 2March 1824, in Litomyšl, east of Prague near the {{traditional}} border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He {{was the third}} child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> correct literary Czech until much later in their lives.|$|E
5|$|Kusanagi {{temporarily}} rejoins Section 9 and {{confirms that}} Ito Munei, an influential politician, {{was behind the}} assassination of General Ka Rum. She also confirms that Munei and other politicians {{use it as a}} front for a brainwashing facility to create an elite group of pure-blooded Japanese {{to take control of the}} country in the next generation and lead it into Munei's vision of a new Golden Age. The Solid State decided to eliminate Munei for interfering in its plans, but Munei was <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> origin of the abduction infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Nathan Furst, whose preferred composition style of grand orchestra and electronica {{was what the}} film's producers were looking for. Initially <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bionicle universe, he explored the official website after getting the job as composer to get better context for his music. This and discussions he had with staff helped {{in the creation of}} eight or nine specific themes. The overall style is grand orchestral, but includes elements of electronic and tribal music. Furst used elements of African, Polynesian, and Eastern European music to communicate the fact that Mata Nui was an island, and when he could he incorporated his music into the action rather than leaving it as a standalone element within scenes.|$|E
50|$|A house slave {{appears in}} the Socratic dialogue, Meno, which was written by Plato. In <b>the</b> {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dialogue, the slave's master, Meno, fails to benefit from Socratic teaching, and reveals himself to be intellectually vicious. Socrates turns to the house-slave, who is a boy <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> geometry. <b>The</b> boy acknowledges his ignorance and learns from his mistakes and finally establishes a proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> desired geometric theorem. This is another example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slave appearing more clever than his master, a popular theme in Greek literature.|$|R
50|$|Criticisms of Sharia law - or {{orthodox}} historical {{sharia law}} - are varied {{and not always}} in agreement. They include: that Islamist leaders are often <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> Islamic law, <b>the</b> Islamist definition <b>of</b> Sharia is in error, its implementation is impractical, and that flexible solutions have been ignored, that its scriptural basis has been corrupted, and that its enforcement is un-Islamic.|$|R
40|$|One {{can argue}} that {{hardware}} design is fast disappearing into <b>the</b> ether <b>of</b> software, especially for embedded systems. Complex algorithms can be synthesized directly into hardware by designers who are <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tradeoffs being made right under their nose. Application-specific engines are synthesized in custom programmable logic and interfaced to embedded soft and hard IP cores in days rather than months. The ability to leverage existing IP allows complex systems to be realized in a fraction the design time and cost. That being said, <b>the</b> vast majority <b>of</b> such systems use fixed hardware designs where the system is composed of and largely exists in custom software and software interfaces. There are several issues with this strategy, the most pressing being system feedback loop delays depend on software timing and tim...|$|R
5|$|Alan Brooke, {{commander}} of the British II Corps sought to put the matter of cooperation right with King Leopold. The King discussed the matter with Brooke, who felt a compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's military aide, stepped in {{and said that the}} 10th Belgian Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th Belgian Division was {{on the wrong side of}} the Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation and the dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF rested on its Belgian ally, the British were now unsure about Belgian military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Although Golos Truda sharply {{criticized the}} anarchist communists of Petrograd as romantics, <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complex social {{forces of the}} Revolution among Petrograd's Bolshevik-supporting factory workers, {{the ideas of the}} union and its paper were {{considered}} bizarre and met with little initial success. Despite this, the anarcho-syndicalist union persisted and gradually acquired a degree of influence, focusing its efforts through propaganda in Golos Truda, with the intent of capturing the attention of the public with its ideals and by differentiating itself from the other radical factions. The paper's circulation continuing to increase in the city and its provinces, with robust anarcho-syndicalist collectives and meetings emerging in Kronstadt, Oboukhovo, and Kolpino. In March 1918, the Bolsheviks moved the seat of government from Petrograd to Moscow, and the anarchists swiftly followed, moving the printing of Golos Truda to the new capital.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these small}} reforms, the 18th century ended with {{continuous}} and unrestrained {{attacks on the}} Court. Although complaints had been common {{since the time of}} Elizabeth I, the problems had become more unrestrained, {{at the same time as}} politically neutral law reformers first arose in any great number. Many critics were barristers of the common law, <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court's workings, but some, such as Sir Samuel Romilly, had trained as a Chancery advocate and were well aware of the Chancery's procedure. The success of the Code Napoleon and the writings of Jeremy Bentham are seen by academic Duncan Kerly to have had much to do with the criticism, and the growing wealth of the country and increasing international trade meant it was crucial that there be a functioning court system for matters of equity. While the upper classes had been struggling with the Court for centuries, and regarded it as a necessary evil, the growing middle and merchant classes were more demanding. With increasing court backlogs, it was clear to many law reformers and politicians that serious reform was needed.|$|E
50|$|Bishop Van de Vyver {{made several}} {{attempts}} to resign his see. The first, in 1903, and the second, in 1905, were {{frustrated by the}} Church authorities, priest and people being <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> his intention. <b>The</b> bishop's third and almost successful attempt to resign (1908) came to <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people, who held a mass meeting. <b>The</b> efforts <b>of</b> clergy and laity caused <b>the</b> final withdrawal <b>of</b> his resignation.|$|R
50|$|A vain, snobbish, and {{possibly}} insane capitalist with a noticeable underbite, he does almost everything {{to earn money}} while also promoting his own ideas of good taste which usually involve a lack of judgment paired with conservative and racist view of society.

25|$|At Oxford, she led a {{campaign}} {{calling for the}} university to give her father an honorary degree; she gained <b>the</b> support <b>of</b> her father's old tutor, the historian Hugh Trevor Roper. Bhutto's campaign was opposed by counter-protests, who believed that her father's supposed involvement in <b>the</b> persecution <b>of</b> Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and atrocities in Bangladesh made him unsuitable and ultimately the university declined to award the honorary degree. In later years, Bhutto acknowledged {{that at this time}} she had been <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pakistani Army's complicity in the atrocities in Bangladesh.|$|R
5|$|In Chicago, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Henry Weems wins $100,000 playing poker against a mobster named Joe Cutrona, though Weems appears <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basic rules of poker. Suspecting that Weems cheated, Cutrona {{attempts}} to kill him by throwing him off the 29th story of the building they are in. After Weems lands in an access hatch to a basement, he stands right back up and walks away, completely uninjured. Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case. Mulder initially believes the man has the ability to cure himself, but Scully thinks he may just be very lucky by landing in a pile of laundry that was right under the access hatch.|$|E
5|$|Desmond Haynes was {{the fourth}} man to be {{dismissed}} for handling the ball in Test cricket, {{just over a year}} after Mohsin. Facing India in late 1983, Haynes had been struck on the bat and pad by the ball, which then headed towards the stumps. The West Indian batsman redirected the ball away from the stumps with his free hand. Upon being given out, Haynes—who was <b>ignorant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law regarding handling the ball—argued with the umpire about the dismissal. After asking the bowler, Kapil Dev, if he wanted to withdraw his appeal, the umpire sent Haynes back to the pavilion. The first instance in One Day Internationals was in 1986, when the Indian batsman Mohinder Amarnath knocked away a turning delivery from Australia's Greg Matthews that was heading for the stumps. In 1993, Graham Gooch became the only player to be dismissed for handling the ball after scoring a century. Playing defensively to try and draw the Test match against Australia, Gooch blocked a short ball from Merv Hughes. The ball flicked off his bat and fell towards his stumps, prompting Gooch to instinctively punch the ball away: Australia won the match by 179 runs.|$|E
