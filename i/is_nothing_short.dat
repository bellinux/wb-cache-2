[...] Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic concluded that it was Good Girl Gone Bad that made Rihanna a [...] "full-fledged international pop star with a regular presence atop the charts". Nick Levine of Digital Spy described the album, as {{the closest thing to a}} Thriller that 2007/08 is likely to produce.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Unreal Tournament {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, earning {{an overall}} score of 92 out of 100 on aggregate review website Metacritic. Mainstream press reviews lauded the title for its graphics, gameplay, and level design. Computer and Video Games concluded [...] "Unreal Tournament <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> of a technical and game-playing marvel destined {{to hold you}} - as it did us - wailing with happiness and wasting far too many precious hours hammering keyboards. An absolute joy to behold." [...] In March 2000, Unreal Tournament was second {{on a list of}} best-selling games in Computer Dealer News trade magazine. However, the development team believed sales would have been higher if the game was released in October 1999.|$|E

The film, set in Jaipur, received positive {{feedback from the}} critics and Chopra's portrayal of Gayatri, an outspoken and rebellious girl, was particularly praised. CNN-IBN noted that the film belonged to Chopra, who [...] "turns Gayatri into the most real woman one have encountered on screen", and the critic Mayank Shekhar added [...] "Parineeti’s act in the film’s first half <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> of National Award winning material."

Chopra garnered several Best Actress nominations, including her second Filmfare nomination for Best Actress.|$|E

500|$|QuackShot {{received}} a mostly positive response from critics upon release. GameRankings, an aggregator for video game reviews, assigned the game {{a score of}} 77% based on 2 reviews. Mega placed the game at #7 in their [...] "Top Mega Drive Games of All Time" [...] list. MegaTech magazine praised the game's graphics, but criticized the game's easiness. Damian Butt from Sega Pro also praised the graphics, and noted the game's various puzzles, explaining that [...] "ven if the ideas are not original, {{the way they are}} strung together to accelerate the pace to overload <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> of breath-taking." [...] Levi Buchanan from IGN gave QuackShot a 7.3/10, also lauding the graphics and animation as excellent and saying the music was pleasing.|$|E
500|$|Numismatist David Bullowa, in {{his early}} work on commemoratives, stated, [...] "the design of this issue is pleasing... the obverse and reverse alike are sharply defined, {{interesting}} and not crowded". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his work on U.S. coins and medals, wrote that the half dollar [...] "manages to combine most of the faults found in the better designs of the 1920's and 1930's." [...] After complaining about the flat design and {{the large amount of}} lettering on both sides, Vermeule critiqued, [...] "the bust of Moses Cleaveland {{can only be described as}} commonplace, and the view of the Great Lakes, bisected by a large compass, <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> of incomprehensible." [...] Nevertheless, Vermeule suggested that Putnam did the best she could to squeeze the required text onto a half dollar, and might have done better with fewer words to place.|$|E
500|$|... "Back to the Shack" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. Carolyn Menyes from Music Times regarded [...] "Back to the Shack" [...] to be instrumentally {{similar to the}} band's second album Pinkerton, and stated that the song [...] "features hooks for days, and the turn {{of events in the}} chorus <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> of a pure earworm." [...] Mike Ayers of The Wall Street Journal described the song as [...] "three minutes of pure Weezer joy", particularly for [...] "its simple, yet heavy riffs and self-deprecating lyrics", while Spin critic Colin Joyce complimented the song for its [...] "anthemic choruses and guitar anti-heroics". HitFix reviewer Dave Lewis called the song [...] "generic rock", although he went on to compliment the middle eight and considered the song as a whole to be [...] "a lot more promising", than their more recent releases.|$|E

Buchanan lauded the fluid model for creating a [...] "sensation of actual flight [...] <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> of magnificent", while PC Magazines staff commented that it makes [...] "planes behave more like real aircraft than any simulator we have seen". Bob and John Nolan called the game's physics programming [...] "groundbreaking", and Chris Ware of the Lexington Herald-Leader found the game {{to be the most}} accurate simulation of flight beyond [...] "those multimillion-dollar flight simulators [...] fighter pilots and astronauts". Noack agreed: he wrote that the game [...] "is about as close to flying within going to the airport". In 1996, Computer Gaming World presented Flight Unlimited with a Special Artistic Achievement Award For Physical Model. The magazine's staff praised Blackley's programming for pushing the genre [...] "higher into the realm of simulation", and listed the game's sophisticated physics model as #5 on its list of [...] "the 15 best ways to die in computer gaming".|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the mixtape received an average score of 83, based on 12 reviews. Jim Carroll of The Irish Times dubbed it [...] "a dashing statement of intent." [...] AllMusic's Andre Barnes wrote of its appeal to hip hop purists and listeners, [...] "For the saints, Live Love ASAP <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> of a guilty pleasure ... But for the aesthetically inclined, Live Love ASAP is a marvel of contemporary rap music, despite its abounding moral decay." [...] Pitchforks Jeff Weiss dubbed the mixtape a [...] "triumph of immaculate taste" [...] and wrote that throughout, [...] "Rocky embodies the sweat-free cool {{of someone who}} has stolen the test and memorized the answers ahead of time." [...] Colin McGowan of Cokemachineglow cited his ability to [...] "command a variety of sounds" [...] as the reason it sounds [...] "unified without drifting into monochrome territory". McGowan viewed that, although his [...] "Wayne-ian pattern" [...] is not as [...] "fluid" [...] nor [...] "dotted with exuberant metaphors", his sensibilities make up for technical shortcomings: ...|$|E
500|$|Radical Middle Newsletter proved controversial. [...] Many responded {{positively}} to Satin's new direction. [...] A professor of management, for example, wrote that unlike Satin's former newsletter, Radical Middle spoke about [...] "reality". [...] Scholarly books began citing the newsletter. [...] In {{a book on}} globalization, Walter Truett Anderson said Radical Middle [...] "carries the encouraging news of an emerging group with a different voice, one that is 'nuanced, hopeful, adult'.... It is essentially a willingness to listen to {{both sides of the}} argument." [...] But three objections were often heard. [...] Some critics accused Satin of misguided policy proposals, as when peace studies scholar Michael N. Nagler wrote that the article [...] "praising humanitarian military intervention as the 'peace movement' of our time, <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> of an insult... to the real peace movement" [...] [...] Other critics accused Satin of abandoning his old constituency, as when author and former New Options advisor David Korten chided him for consciously choosing pragmatism over idealism. [...] There were also accusations of elitism, as when the executive editor of Yes! [...] magazine said Satin favored globalization because it appealed to his interests and those of his [...] "law school buddies".|$|E

500|$|The feminist {{film critic}} Molly Haskell also wrote an {{approving}} {{review of the}} film in the Village Voice: [...] "In a world, an industry, and particularly a genre which values the new and improved product above all, it <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> of miraculous {{to see a movie}} which dares to go backward, a technological artefact which has nobly deteriorated into a human being. I speak of the new and obsolete James Bond, played by a man named George Lazenby, who seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that one woman who is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates." [...] Haskell was also affected by the film's emotional ending: [...] "The love between Bond and his Tracy begins as a payment and ends as a sacrament. After ostensibly getting rid of the bad guys, they are married. They drive off to a shocking, stunning ending. Their love, being too real, is killed by the conventions it defied. But they win the final victory by calling, unexpectedly, upon feeling. Some of the audience hissed, I was shattered. If you like your Bonds with happy endings, don't go." ...|$|E
