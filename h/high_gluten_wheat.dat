The main objective of this thesis was to explore plant proteins, more specifically <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> as a binder in wood adhesives intended for typical solid wood applications such as furniture and flooring. Alkaline and acidic dispersions of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> were used as wood adhesives to bond together beech wood substrates. Soy protein isolate {{was used as a}} reference. The tensile shear strengths of the substrates were measured for comparison of bond strength and resistance to cold water. AFM in colloidal probe mode was used to investigate nanoscale adhesion between cellulose and protein films. <b>Wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> was divided into the two protein classes; glutenins and gliadins, and their adhesive performance was compared with that of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> Heat treatment and mild hydrolysis were investigated as means for improving bonding performance of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> The treated <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> samples were analysed by SE-HPLC and 13 C-NMR to correlate molecular size distribution and structural changes with bonding performance. Soy protein isolate is superior to <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> especially in regards to water resistance. However, the bond strength of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> is improved when starved bond lines are avoided. The AFM analysis reveals higher interfacial adhesion between soy protein isolate and cellulose than between <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and cellulose. These results partly explain some of the differences in bonding performance between the plant proteins. Soy protein isolate contains more polar amino acid residues than <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and possibly interacts more strongly with cellulose. Furthermore, the bond performances of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and glutenin are similar, while that of gliadin is inferior to the others, especially regarding water resistance. The extent of penetration of the dispersions into the wood material has a large impact on the results. The bonding performance of gliadin is similar to the others when over-penetration of the dispersion into the wood material is avoided. Moreover, the bond strength of the <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> samples heated at 90 °C was in general improved compared to that of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> A small improvement was also obtained for some of the hydrolyzed <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> samples (degree of hydrolysis: 0 - 0. 6 %).

This study investigates {{the influence of}} the presence of starch, the main component of wheat, on enzymatic <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> hydrolysis. <b>Wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> present in <b>wheat</b> flour (WFG) and vital <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> (VWG) were hydrolyzed at constant protein concentrations, but subsequently 5. 6 times higher amounts of wheat flour. Nevertheless, WFG hydrolysis at 40 % total solids resulted in significantly higher degrees of hydrolysis (DH%) than VWG hydrolysis at 7. 2 % solids. This difference increased to up to 4. 5 % in 6 h and diminished again for longer reaction times. Possible differences in the gluten composition and the presence of albumins and globulins in wheat flour could not explain the difference in DH% because the addition of starch to VWG increased the rate of hydrolysis similarly. Instead, it was concluded that starch granules impede gluten aggregation, which facilitates the hydrolysis. At higher solid concentrations of up to 70 % wheat flour, the positive effect of starch disappeared, because WFG hydrolysis was hindered by mass transfer limitations and lower water activities...|$|R

There was an interaction between pH and temperature, whereby low pH (pH 3) and high temperature (75 °C) of film forming solution resulted in films that had highest resistance to microbial degradation. Strategies that proved unsuccessful in improving resistance to ruminal degradation included use of the cross-linking enzyme, transglutaminase; induction of a Maillard reaction; and increasing the time of heating film forming solutions. Utilizing HCl versus acetic acid as the means to lower the pH of the film forming solution resulted in poor film formation, which {{can be attributed to}} glutenin‟s solubility in acetic acid.

Second, the study evaluates wheat-gluten-based packaging film and compares it with low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polylactide (PLA) packaging film over the life cycle of these products. Scenarios including extrusion and casting for film production, incineration with energy recovery, and composting for end-of-life treatments are evaluated. Such comparison offers insight in environmental benefits of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> over conventional plastic film as well as its bio-based alternative and identifies its optimal production and disposal methods. For <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> production, the LCA results show that the impacts of the <b>wheat</b> cultivation and <b>gluten</b> drying phase are dominant in the majority of the 18 impact categories in the ReCiPe midpoint assessment method. The LCA results also exhibit that the scenario with <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> film produced by extrusion and incinerated to recover embodied energy is favorable from environmental perspective. It offers great benefits in climate change and fossil depletion over LDPE film and in 14 impact categories over PLA film.

40|$|<b>Gluten,</b> <b>wheat</b> storage protein, {{exhibits}} unique {{ability of}} forming a viscoelastic dough upon hydration and mixing. It {{is composed of}} alcohol soluble proteins, gliadins, and polymeric glutenins. The interactions between gluten proteins, gliadins and glutenins, {{are responsible for the}} formation of viscoelastic protein network. Gliadins are recognized as the protein fractions responsible for viscous nature of gluten and, glutenins for the elasticity. High molecular weight subunits of glutenin (HMW-GS) have been found particularly important in imposing elasticity to gluten structure. The mechanism involves the structural transitions between β-sheet and β-turns and is related to the long repeat regions of HMW-GS and their interactions. On the other hand, corn protein, zein, is relatively small protein and does not demonstrate viscoelastic properties at room temperature. However, α-zein was shown to form viscoelastic dough at moisture contents larger than 20 % when hold and mixed at 35 °C, which is above its glass transition temperature. Here, it is speculated that gliadin, which comprises significant portion of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> is not only simply a filler imparting viscosity to <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> but also an important functional protein fraction that goes through structural transformation with addition of HMW-GS to the system. Therefore, it is hypothesized that, zein, which shows similarities to wheat gliadin in number of aspects, can attain viscoelastic properties at room temperature with addition of co-protein similar to that of HMW-GS in <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> <b>Wheat</b> and corn proteins were utilized in this study to investigate and compare their viscoelastic properties. Fundamental rheological techniques and Fourier Transform InfraRed (FT-IR) spectroscopic studies were performed to understand the structure-function relationship in these proteins. Improved viscoelastic properties were obtained for zein with addition of co-protein at room temperature. The transformation of gliadin with the addition of HMW-GS and glutenin was also shown. However, gliadin and zein were found to gain structural functionality through different mechanisms. In gliadin, structural transformation took place through transitions between β-sheet and β-turns. On the other hand, main transition in zein was found to be from α-helix to β-sheet. ...|$|R
