40|$|SUMMARY Eighty five 24 hour balance {{studies were}} {{performed}} on 70 healthy newborn infants of gestational age 27 - 40 weeks; dietary intake and stool losses of sodium were measured. There was a relation between <b>gastrointestinal</b> sodium <b>absorption</b> and conceptional age (the sum of gestational and postnatal age), whether expressed as absolute stool sodium losses or as the ratio of stool sodium to dietary sodium intake. The stool K:Na ratio rose appreciably with maturation, although stool content of potassium was not greatly increased. These findings suggest that in-testinal sodium absorption is inefficient in immature babies and {{that the degree of}} malabsorption is inversely related to conceptional age. Hyponatraemia is common in very immature infants and since <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>absorption</b> is one <b>factor</b> in sodium homeostasis, changes that occur in intestinal sodium reabsorption during postnatal development may be important in the pathogenesis of hyponatraemia. Little is known, however, about intestinal sodium reabsorption during early post...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether a spermine (SPM) -induced increase in <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>absorption</b> of an allergen leads to an anaphylactic response in sensitized mice. First, we examined the enhancing effect of SPM on the <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>absorption</b> of ovalbumin (OVA) in an in situ jejunum loop study in rats and an in vivo oral absorption study in mice. Second, we investigated whether enhancement of <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>absorption</b> of OVA caused by SPM induces an anaphylactic response in mice sensitized to OVA. In the in situ jejunum loop study in rats, a significant amount of immune-reactive OVA was detected in the plasma after co-administration of OVA and SPM. Oral co-administration of OVA and SPM to mice in vivo also increased plasma OVA concentrations in an SPM dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, in sensitized mice, a significant increase in plasma histamine levels occurred along with the increase in plasma OVA levels after co-administration of OVA with SPM. This finding suggests that an SPM-induced increase in <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>absorption</b> of OVA leads to an anaphylactic response. These results indicate that excess oral ingestion of SPM may have widespread health effects, including the induction of food allergies, via modulation of the function of the gastrointestinal epithelial barrier...|$|R

A simple method for extrapolation of benzene-induced cancer risk from the inhalation to oral route is proposed. The method {{is based on the}} relative efficiency of benzene absorption across routes of exposure, especially pulmonary and gastrointestinal barriers. There exists substantial literature on pulmonary absorption in humans and a few laboratory animal species. Data on oral absorption in humans are lacking; hence extrapolation is based on <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>absorption</b> studies in several experimental animal species. Currently, available physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) animal models are not useful for human risk extrapolation. A review of the relevant literature suggests absorption efficiencies of 50 % and 100 % for inhalation and oral routes of exposure, respectively. Application of these <b>absorption</b> <b>factors</b> to the current inhalation unit risk range of 2. 2 × 10 - 6 – 7. 8 × 10 - 6 per µg/m 3 results in a proposed range for the oral unit risk of 4. 4 × 10 - 7 to 1. 6 × 10 - 6 /µg/L...|$|R

When body stores of these ions decline significantly, <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>absorption,</b> bone resorption, and renal tubular reabsorption increase to normalize their levels. Renal regulation of these ions occurs through glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption and/or secretion and is therefore an important determinant of plasma ion concentration.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An optical {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to determine the}} fraction of irradiance absorbed in a typical encapsulated crystalline silicon PV cell. It is found that the active area of an untextured PV cell has an <b>absorption</b> <b>factor</b> of 85. 6 %, while for a textured cell this <b>absorption</b> <b>factor</b> {{is as high as}} 90. 3 %. It is pointed out that free-carriers, in particular those introduced by emitter doping, contribute significantly to the absorption of long-wavelength solar irradiance. It was investigated to which extent the <b>absorption</b> <b>factor</b> can be controlled by the doping levels in the cell. Using a more shallow emitter reduces the <b>absorption</b> <b>factor</b> by only 1 %. For photovoltaic/thermal applications there is room for a 3 % increase in <b>absorption</b> <b>factor</b> by absorbing more irradiance in the back contact...|$|R

To investigate {{the possibility of}} enhanced <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>absorption</b> {{of aluminum}} in uremia, we measured the urinary aluminum excretion of rats following an oral load of 11 mg aluminum. Rats, in which uremia had been established by the remnant kidney model, excreted 1. 5 to 2. 2 -fold higher amounts of aluminum in their urine over a collection period of five days compared with their controls. Within {{this period of time}} up to 0. 17 ± 0. 08 % of the oral dose of aluminum was recovered in the urine of the uremic animals. Serum concentrations of aluminum were significantly elevated five hours after ingestion of aluminum, but this increase was similar in rats with normal or reduced renal function. Uremic rats excreted significantly less aluminum during the first 24 hours after i. v. administration of 15 µg aluminum if the data were corrected for the higher baseline excretion rates. The excretion rate showed a negative correlation with the serum creatinine. Selective parathyroidectomy had no effect on the pattern or amount of urinary aluminum excretion after an oral load in either uremic rats or in rats with normal renal function. We conclude that the <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>absorption</b> of aluminum is increased in uremic rats, and that parathyroid hormone has no detectable effect on the magnitude of aluminum absorption, regardless of the renal function in this model...|$|R

40|$|<b>Gastrointestinal</b> <b>absorption</b> of citrate was {{measured}} in stone patients with idiopathic hypocitraturia to determine if citrate malabsorption could account for low urinary citrate. Citrate absorption {{was measured}} directly from recovery of orally administered potassium citrate (40 mEq.) in the intestinal lavage fluid, using an intestinal washout technique. In 7 stone patients citrate absorption, serum citrate levels, peak citrate concentration in serum and area under the curve {{were not significantly different}} from those of 7 normal subjects. Citrate absorption was rapid and efficient in both groups, with 96 to 98 % absorbed within 3 hours. The absorption of citrate was less efficient from a tablet preparation of potassium citrate than from a liquid preparation, probably due to a delayed release of citrate from wax matrix. However, citrate absorption from solid potassium citrate was still high at 91 %, compared to 98 % for a liquid preparation. Thus, hypocitraturia is unlikely to be due to an impaired <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>absorption</b> of citrate in stone patients without overt bowel disease...|$|R

Recent work describing the pharmacokinetics (PK) of d-β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) following oral ingestion of a ketone monoester ((R) - 3 -hydroxybutyl (R) - 3 -hydroxybutyrate) found multiple input sites, nonlinear disposition and feedback on endogenous production. In the current work, a human systems pharmacology model for <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>absorption</b> and subsequent {{disposition of}} small molecules (monocarboxylic acids with molecular weight < 200 Da) was developed with an application to a ketone monoester. The systems model {{was developed by}} collating {{the information from the}} literature and knowledge gained from empirical population modelling of the clinical data. In silico knockout variants of this systems model were used to explore the mechanism of <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>absorption</b> of ketones. The knockouts included active absorption across different regions in the gut and also a passive diffusion knockout, giving 10 gut knockouts in total. Exploration of knockout variants has suggested that {{there are at least three}} distinct regions in the gut that contribute to absorption of ketones. Passive diffusion predominates in the proximal gut and active processes contribute to the absorption of ketones in the distal gut. Low doses are predominantly absorbed from the proximal gut by passive diffusion whereas high doses are absorbed across all sites in the gut. This work has provided mechanistic insight into the absorption process of ketones, in the form of unique in silico knockouts that have potential for application with other therapeutics. Future studies on absorption process of ketones are suggested to substantiate findings in this study...|$|R
40|$|The <b>absorption</b> <b>factor</b> of a PV cell {{is defined}} as the {{fraction}} of incident solar irradiance that is absorbed by the cell. This <b>absorption</b> <b>factor</b> {{is one of the major}} parameters determining the cell temperature under operational conditions. Experimentally the <b>absorption</b> <b>factor</b> can be derived from reflection and transmission measurements. The spectral reflection and transmission factors were measured for a set of crystalline silicon (c-Si) samples with a gradually increasing complexity. The experimental results agree very well with the results from a 2 D numerical model that was developed. It was found that the AM 1. 5 <b>absorption</b> <b>factor</b> of a typical encapsulated c-Si photovoltaic cell is as high as 90. 5 %. Insight was gained in the cell parameters that influence this <b>absorption</b> <b>factor.</b> The presence of texture at the front of the c-Si wafer of sufficient steepness is essential to achieve such a high <b>absorption</b> <b>factor.</b> Sub-bandgap solar irradiance is mainly absorbed in the very thin emitter by means of free-carrier absorption. By minimizing reflective losses over the entire solar spectrum, the AM 1. 5 absorption of c-Si cells can theoretically be increased to 93. 0 %.

40|$|Hyperphosphatemia occurs universally in end-stage {{renal disease}} (ESRD) unless efforts are made to prevent {{positive}} phosphate balance. Positive phosphate balance results {{from the loss of}} renal elimination of phosphate and continued obligatory intestinal absorption of dietary phosphate. Increased efflux of phosphate from bone because of excess parathyroid hormone-mediated bone resorption can also contribute to increased serum phosphate concentrations in the setting of severe hyperparathyroidism. It is important to treat hyperphosphatemia because it contributes to the pathogenesis of hyperparathyroidism, vascular calcifications, and increased cardiovascular mortality in ESRD patients. Attaining a neutral phosphate balance, which {{is the key to the}} management of hyperphosphatemia in ESRD, is a challenge. Control of phosphorus depends on its removal during dialysis and the limitation of <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>absorption</b> by dietary phosphate restriction and chelation of phosphate. Knowledge of the quantitative aspects of phosphate balance is useful in optimizing our use of phosphate binders, dialysis frequency, and vitamin D sterols. The development of new phosphate binders and efforts to find new ways to inhibit <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>absorption</b> of phosphate will lead to improvements in the control of serum phosphate levels in ESRD...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{stochastic}} π-calculus is a formalism {{that have}} been shown of interest for modelling systems where the stochasticity and the delay of transitions are important features, such as the biochemical reactions. Commonly, duration of transitions within stochastic π-calculus models follow an exponential random variable.
