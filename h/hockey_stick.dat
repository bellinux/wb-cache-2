5|$|Towel Power is a {{term used}} by the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL) to {{describe}} the waving of rally towels by their fans. The tradition started in the 1982 Campbell Conference Finals when Vancouver played the Chicago Blackhawks. During game two of the series, head coach Roger Neilson waved a white towel {{on the end of}} a <b>hockey</b> <b>stick</b> in a mock surrender after being upset with the officiating. Neilson was ejected and the Canucks lost 4â€“1. When Vancouver returned home from Chicago for the following game fans supported both Neilson and the Canucks by waving towels first at the airport when the team arrived and then during the next game. The Canucks won the next three games and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals where they were defeated by the New York Islanders. As part of the tradition, the Canucks hand out towels prior to playoff games for fans to help support the team.|$|E
5|$|Plante {{was born}} on a farm near Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel, in Mauricie, Quebec, the first of 11 {{children}} born to Palma and Xavier Plante. The family moved to Shawinigan Falls, where his father worked {{in one of the}} local factories. In 1932, Plante began to play hockey, skateless and with a tennis ball, using a goaltender's <b>hockey</b> <b>stick</b> his father had carved from a tree root. When he was five years old, Plante fell off a ladder and broke his hand. The fracture failed to heal properly and affected his playing style during his early hockey career; he underwent successful corrective surgery as an adult. Plante suffered from asthma starting in early childhood. This prevented him from skating for extended periods so he gravitated to playing goaltender. As his playing progressed, Jacques received his first regulation goaltender's stick for Christmas of 1936. His father made Plante's first pads by stuffing potato sacks and reinforcing them with wooden panels. As a child, Plante played hockey outdoors in the bitterly cold Quebec winters. His mother taught him how to knit his own tuques to protect him from the cold. Plante continued knitting and embroidering throughout his life and wore his hand-knitted tuques while playing and practicing until entering the National Hockey League (NHL).|$|E

Gail Kim {{accompanied}} AMW to the ring. Mid-way through the bout, Team 3D performed their signature Whassup? maneuver on Storm. Kim interfered in the bout, distracting the referee.

AMW earned a near-fall after a bearhug and a lariat combination on Ray. Team 3D followed with their own near-fall on Harris, after they performed their signature Deadly Device maneuver on Storm.

25|$|Throughout his career, {{the ball}} was bowled underarm along the ground at a two-stump wicket. It is {{believed}} that Waymark bowled at a fastish pace with variations. He was also an accomplished batsman, though not as highly regarded in this department as his single wicket partner Colchin. The bat was curved like a modern <b>hockey</b> <b>stick</b> and the batsman generally attacked the rolled ball. Batsmen did not develop defensive techniques until the straight bat was invented {{in response to the}} pitched delivery, which was introduced in the 1760s, more than a decade after Waymark's career ended.|$|E
25|$|An ice <b>hockey</b> <b>stick</b> is a {{piece of}} {{equipment}} used in ice hockey to shoot, pass, and carry the puck across the ice. Ice hockey sticks are approximately 150â€“200cm long, composed of a long, slender shaft with a flat extension at one end called the blade. The blade is the part of the stick used to contact the puck, and is typically 25 to 40cm long. Stick dimensions can vary widely, as they are usually built to suit a particular player's size and preference. The blade is positioned at roughly a 135Â° angle from the axis of the shaft, giving the stick a partly 'L-shaped' appearance. The shaft of the stick is fairly rigid, but it has some flexibility to benefit some shots.|$|E
