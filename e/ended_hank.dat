5000|$|In 1944 Lum and his {{big bass}} fiddle joined Hank’s band, The Drifting Cowboys. Lum {{told of the}} first time he played music with Hank, [...] "We had got to be friends working {{together}} in the shipyard. One night I went where he was playing. I had bought a bass and was learning to play it. I was also friends with the guy who was playing bass that night and he asked me to sit in while he went to the bathroom. Hank and Audrey were dancing while I played the set. When the music <b>ended,</b> <b>Hank</b> asked me ‘You want a job playing with the band?’ I told him, ‘Hank, I don’t know how to play too good.’ He said, ‘You want to learn? I’ll pay you $20 a week and room and board.’" ...|$|E
5000|$|Williams' {{recording}} of [...] "Lost on the River" [...] is significant for three reasons: it was recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati rather than Castle Studio in Nashville; {{it features a}} mandolin solo, an instrument that rarely appears on Hank's studio recordings; and it's the first duet the singer released with his wife Audrey. Near the end of 1948, Williams had been working the Louisiana Hayride in Shreveport and had not recorded in over a {{year because of the}} American Federation of Musicians recording ban, but producer Fred Rose immediately scheduled a session in Cincinnati on December 22, 1948 - eight days after the ban <b>ended.</b> <b>Hank</b> and Audrey drove from Shreveport to Cincinnati to meet him. The session in Cincinnati is best remembered for producing what would become Hank's breakout hit in early 1949, [...] "Lovesick Blues," [...] but the {{recording of}} [...] "Lost on the River" [...] is also notable for Clyde Baum's mandolin solo. Williams would use Baum's mandolin again on [...] "May You Never Be Alone" [...] but generally avoided the instrument for practical purposes; he loved string band music, but rarely brought the mandolin into his lineup because he preferred the electric [...] "take off" [...] guitar that Ernest Tubb had popularized, which could cut through a noisy barroom as no mandolin ever could. The other players on the session included Tommy Jackson (fiddle), Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), Louis Innis (rhythm guitar), and Willie Thawl (bass). The song contains one of Hank's recurring themes: despair from the abandonment of a lover who will soon remarry.|$|E
50|$|Some {{people say}} that a near-fatal car accident, which Hank suffered, {{was a result of}} tragic {{response}} to dreams unfulfilled.

[...] Lacking a Navy or Marine training program on its campus, Wisconsin had lost most of its best football players after the 1942 season, with the majority being transferred to Michigan.

5000|$|Hank Cooper, {{a small-town}} {{mechanic}} {{who works in}} a local garage, enters a junk-car race where drivers select a jalopy and attempt to start and race it. <b>Hank</b> <b>ends</b> up getting [...] "last choice" [...] and is forced to choose the only car left, a broken-down Herbie. Assisted by his [...] "spiritually enlightened" [...] but goofy friend Roddy, Hank manages to get Herbie started just before he is towed off the track. In appreciation for his kindness to the little VW, Herbie manages to win the race, trouncing such junkers as a Cadillac limousine and an early-model Corvair Monza convertible. The judges of the race, Donny Shotz (Micky Dolenz), Alex (Alexandra Wentworth), who Hank used to date; and Simon, {{find it hard to believe}} that such a tiny car could run so fast, and Alex challenges Hank to prove that he didn't try any tricks during the race, to win. Hank takes Alex for a ride, showing Herbie's speed, and their relationship is re-kindled (with Herbie driving them to an isolated area and locking his doors, as he did with Jim Douglas and Carol Bennett in the first movie). Meanwhile, Roddy tells Hank that Herbie is special, and takes him to an automotive art show. At the show, Simon sees Herbie and attempts to discover why his car, which failed him, took Hank to victory. He discovers that Herbie was built by a Dr. Gustav Stumpfel (Harold Gould) shortly after World War II. He asked Dr. Gustav to create another car, but he wants the car to be pure evil and black. He ends up naming the second car, Horace the Hate Bug, using the [...] "magical ingredients" [...] of a picture of Simon, along with Herbie's key.|$|R
50|$|The {{setting is}} in the panhandle of Texas {{probably}} during the 1980s when the book was written. It starts off with Drover, Hank's assistant, coming to him and waking him up saying there's been a murder. They find a dead chicken and Hank {{says it was a}} 'raccoon' who did it, and he says he knows where it is. But the thing he finds in a bush is a porcupine, and later the local barncat, Pete, teases Hank for having quills in his nose. Later that day around dark, Hank assigns Drover to watch the chicken house while Hank goes on patrol. A couple hours later, Drover starts yelling that a monster is attacking, Hank comes running and attacks the 'monster' which {{turns out to be a}} cow. The next day Hank and Drover sneak a trip on the back of a truck to town. In town the two dogs anger Bruno, a large boxer. The next day back at the ranch they find another murdered chicken, and Hank can't resist eating it. He wakes up and finds out that he is in a pile of feathers, and Sally May finds him and thinks that he is the murderer, so High Loper then ties the chicken's head around Hank's neck. Hank then realizes that he has to leave the ranch. He heads out and meets two turkey vultures, Wallace and Junior, and in the end he gives them the chicken's head and they fight over it, but a hawk swoops down and grabs it. The next day Hank finds a female coyote named Girl-Who-Drinks-Blood (who he calls Missy); they become good friends but then Missy's family shows up. Hank manages to trick them into not eating him but is forced into the tribe and becomes Missy's fiancé. Her brother Scraunch has met Hank on the field of battle before. He and Hank are now deadly enemies. Hank becomes good friends with two coyote brothers named Rip and Snort, and during a night of carousing and singing with them, he runs into Drover, who says that Hank is a traitor. After a long time with the coyotes, Scraunch decides that if Hank wants to prove himself to the coyote tribe and marry Missy, he must join in for a raid on the ranch. So Scraunch, Rip, Snort, and Hank along with other coyotes raid the chicken house. But during the middle of the raid, faced with the order to kill Drover, Hank realizes that what he is doing is wrong. So Hank turns on the coyotes, and Scraunch is about to kill Hank when High Loper, who was woken up, fires his gun at the coyotes. The coyotes then run off, and all <b>ends</b> well with <b>Hank</b> back on the ranch as Head of Ranch Security.|$|R
