5|$|New {{regulations}} for prison officers {{were published in}} the <b>Government</b> <b>Gazette</b> in 1902, and a new Prisons Act was passed in 1903. While in theory the passing of the Act should have resulted in significant prison reform, this did not eventuate. The legislation left much of the changes to executive regulation, at the discretion of the governor, and was described by the media as a feeble document.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{receiving}} presidential assent, a bill becomes law and {{is known}} as an Act of Parliament.

5|$|Francesco Rivarola, {{the commandant}} of the police, had his {{office of the}} Deputy Inspector General of Executive Police {{stationed}} within the Castellania since 1814 when Malta was gradually adapting as a British colony.

5|$|All new {{subsidiary}} legislation must {{be sent to}} the Council for scrutiny within 14 days of their publication in the <b>Government</b> <b>Gazette.</b> The Council is then required to make its report to the Speaker and the appropriate Minister within 30 days. However, unlike with bills, there is no provision to extend the original deadline. As with bills, tardiness in sending an adverse report results in a conclusive presumption that the Council finds no differentiating measures in the {{subsidiary legislation}}. Where the Council issues an adverse report, the Minister must revoke or amend the offending provision within six months of the report, unless Parliament passes a resolution confirming that provision.|$|E
5|$|If, on {{nomination}} day, {{there are}} two or more candidates nominated for election, the returning officer must immediately adjourn the election so that a poll can be taken. He or she must assign each candidate an approved symbol to be printed on the candidate's ballot paper and announce by publishing a notice of contested election in the <b>Government</b> <b>Gazette</b> with information about the forthcoming poll, including the candidates' names and symbols, the date of polling day (which must be not earlier than the 10th day or later than the 56th day after {{the date of the}} notice) and the locations of polling stations.|$|E
5|$|The {{minister}} {{charged with}} responsibility for the Act is required to publish in the <b>Government</b> <b>Gazette</b> a list stating the Government departments which are authorized departments {{for the purposes of}} the Act, and the names and addresses for service of the solicitors for the departments. As of 7 December 2005, no such list had been published. For this reason, in Chee Siok Chin v. Minister for Home Affairs (2005), decided on that date, the High Court held that instead of instituting the action against the Minister for Home Affairs and the Commissioner of Police, the applicants should have done so against the Attorney-General. Nonetheless, the suit should not be dismissed as this was a procedural irregularity that could be cured by substituting the Attorney-General as the respondent.|$|E

5|$|The {{plaintiffs in}} this case were devotees of the Jin Long Si Temple, which was a temple in the Serangoon area of Singapore espousing Buddhist, Confucian and Taoist teachings. The temple property, which was located {{near the site of}} the Bartley Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Station, was compulsorily {{acquired}} pursuant to the Land Acquisition Act. The <b>Government</b> <b>Gazette</b> notification relating to the acquisition published on 20 January 2003 specified that the temple property (together with another piece of land nearby) had been acquired for the construction and comprehensive redevelopment of the Mass Rapid Transit's Circle Line.|$|E
5|$|To {{initiate}} the election process, the Prime Minister issues a writ {{addressed to the}} returning officer, {{who is responsible for}} overseeing the election. The writ of election states when nomination day will be (which must not be less than ten days nor more than a month after the date of the writ), and the place of nomination. The returning officer is required to notify the public that the writ of election has been issued and the day, time and place of nomination of candidates by publishing a notice in the <b>Government</b> <b>Gazette</b> at least four clear days before nomination day.|$|E
5|$|Further {{action was}} not taken until 1902, when new {{regulations}} for prison officers {{were published in}} the <b>Government</b> <b>Gazette.</b> A new Prison Act was passed in 1903, replacing sixteen previous acts. It provided for classification of prisoners, provision of adequate work for prisoners, and the creation of the position of comptroller general of prisons, to assume the functions the sheriff had undertaken as inspector of prisons. While in theory the passing of the act should have been a landmark moment in prison reform, this did not eventuate. The legislation left much of the changes to executive regulation, at the discretion of the governor, and was described by the media as a feeble document. Other problems included Fremantle Prison's inscrutability for classification, due to its design, and that the sheriff was allowed to hold the office of comptroller general of prisons, effectively making it no more than a change in name.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{data was}} {{collected}} through passenger lists, church registers, almanacs and directories, the index to the WA <b>Government</b> <b>Gazettes,</b> and old newspapers. All the information was condensed and handwritten on individual cards and sorted alphabetically by surname and filed at the J S Battye Library on microfilm.|$|R
50|$|Publications {{of minutes}} and proceedings, often known as {{journals}}, of legislatures are often kept for record-keeping.

50|$|After {{a new law}} is approved, it is {{announced}} to the public through the publication of <b>government</b> <b>gazettes</b> and/or on official government websites. National laws of extraordinary importance to the public may be announced {{by the head of}} state on national broadcast. Local laws are usually announced in local newspapers and published in bulletins or compendia of municipal regulations.|$|R
5|$|On the {{weekends}} of 9–10 November 2013 and 8–9 February 2014 all voting stations were opened for new voters to register {{and for those}} who moved residence to re-register in their new voting district. The presidency of South Africa urged voters who had missed the voting station registration weekends to register at an IEC office during office hours. Presidential spokesperson, Mac Maharaj, said that voters were allowed to register to vote until the election date is published in a <b>government</b> <b>gazette,</b> after which the voters' roll is closed. Approximately 5.5 million people in total visited voting stations, including between 1 and 2 million new voters. This increased the number of registered voters to 25.3 million, representing 80.5% of the 31.4 million people eligible to vote in the country. South Africans who were born after the 1994 general election, known as the born-free generation, and are aged 18 or older were eligible to vote for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Under section 35 of the Interpretation Act, if {{written law}} confers power on a {{minister}} {{to give a}} direction, issue an order or authorize something to be done, exercise of the power may be done (unless the law states otherwise) under the signature of the permanent secretary to the ministry which the minister is responsible for, or of any public officer authorized in writing by the minister. Section 36 of the Act permits a minister empowered {{to exercise a power}} or perform a duty to, {{in the absence of any}} statutory provision to the contrary, depute another person to exercise the power or perform the duty on his or her behalf. The delegation must be approved by the President (acting on Cabinet's advice); may be made subject to conditions, exceptions and qualifications; and must be published in the <b>Government</b> <b>Gazette.</b> The minister remains capable of exercising the power or performing the duty personally. The power to make subsidiary legislation cannot be delegated.|$|E
5|$|When Article 5A {{is brought}} into force, the President will {{also be able to}} decline to assent to a bill seeking to amend the Constitution that has a direct or {{indirect}} effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. In this case, the Cabinet may also advise the President to refer to the Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill indeed has this effect. If the Tribunal rules that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the Tribunal pronounces its opinion in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal decides to the contrary, the Prime Minister may opt to submit the bill to the electorate. If the bill is supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the results of the referendum have been published in the <b>Government</b> <b>Gazette.</b>|$|E
50|$|Though {{there is}} no exact {{historical}} data on how handloom weaving been started in Mubarakpur, we know that during the 14th century, cotton weaving began, according to ancient Vedic and Buddhist literature. <b>Government</b> <b>gazettes</b> report that Raja Mubaraksha's entourage had many families whose profession was weaving. It is speculated that they started weaving saris and other dress material during the 16th century.|$|R
50|$|Often, some routes {{have also}} {{progressively}} become partially Opal-enabled {{because they are}} run by different depots. These rollouts are only stated on the New South Wales <b>government</b> <b>gazettes</b> and are not announced through ministerial announcements. It is not compulsory for bus routes to be partially Opal-enabled on the dates stated on the gazettes. However it allows some buses to be Opal enabled even before the ministerial announcements.|$|R
50|$|A {{government}} {{printing office}} was required in Queensland after separation in 1859 when {{the establishment of the}} new Colonial Government generated a need for the printing of Hansard, the official report of the proceedings of the Houses of Parliament.

25|$|Under Atkinson the <b>Government</b> <b>Gazette</b> {{continued}} to be a great success publishing two issues per week from 1823 and in 1827 it was the most widely circulated of all the English language newspapers in Bengal. The <b>Government</b> <b>Gazette</b> included local and national news including extracts from English newspapers and those of Bombay and Madras, letters from correspondents, information on the customs and manners of the people of India as well as occasionally translations of Sanskrit hymns and Persian poetry. For the years 1825-1828 Atkinson leased the Press and the <b>Government</b> <b>Gazette</b> from the Orphan Society for an annual fee of 40,000 rupees effectively becoming its proprietor to run as his own business.|$|E
