40|$|This paper {{presents}} the dynamic modeling {{and control of}} a rotary <b>disc</b> <b>dryer</b> used in fishing industry. The nonlinear model obtained from energy and mass balances, is validated with real data measured in two plants of fishmeal located {{in the north of}} Peru. A constrained nonlinear predictive controller is designed with the purpose of regulating the moisture content in the fishmeal to obtain a stable final product. Simulation results are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the controller to handle input, slew-rate and output constraints even for the case of short prediction horizons...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} give a {{concrete}} response to the need of predictive contact drying simulation tools in pharmaceutical industry, simulation programs for contact drying of pharmaceutical powders were developed in this thesis work. These are two programs for simulate the two main contact drying operation conditions used in the pharmaceutical industry: vacuum and atmospheric contact drying of agitated beds. The programs give a predictive estimation of drying rate curve and bulk bed temperature during contact drying. Only initial conditions, operating conditions, geometrical data, type of substances, solid phase properties and two parameter {{for the evaluation of}} an empirical mixing coefficient, are required as input data. A first validation of the developed programs was made on experimental data from literature, regarding two common pharmaceutical excipient powders, wetted with water and dried in a <b>disc</b> contact <b>dryer.</b> The simulation results show a good agreement with the experimental dat...|$|R
