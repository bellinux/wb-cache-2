40|$|The binding of {{molecular}} hydrogen to a metal center {{leads to the}} elongation of the H−H bond and subsequently to its cleavage along the reaction coordinate <b>for</b> the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of H 2. There has been considerable interest {{in the study of}} the activation of dihydrogen and map out the reaction coordinate for the homolysis of H 2 on a metal center. A large number of H 2 complexes reported to date possess H−H distances ranging from 0. 8 to 1. 0 Å. A relatively fewer examples of elongated dihydrogen complexes wherein the H−H distances fall in the range of 1. 0 to 1. 5 Å, are known. Study of the elongated dihydrogen complexes is of great significance because of its relevance in important catalytic processes such as hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, and hydroformylation. Objectives The objectives of this work are as follows: (a) Synthesis and characterization of elongated dihydrogen complexes with chelating phosphine coligands by varying the electron donor ability.

(c) Map the reaction coordinate <b>for</b> the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>for</b> the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of H 2 to a metal center.

The dynamics of the exchange was studied using NMR spectroscopy. In addition, a series of ruthenium dihydrogen complexes of the type trans-[Ru(Cl) (η 2 -H 2) (PP) ][BF 4] (PP = 1, 2 - Synopsis bis(diarylphosphino) ethane) has been synthesized and characterized wherein the aryl group is a benzyl moiety with a substituent (p-fluoro, H, m-methyl, p-methyl, p-isopropyl); in this series of complexes, a small increment in the electron donor ability (decrease in Hammett substituent constants) of the chelating phosphine ligand resulted in an elongation of the H−H bond by a small, yet significant amount. We also synthesized a series of 16 -electron dicationic dihydrogen complexes bearing elongated dihydrogen ligand. In addition, we prepared a series of dihydrogen complexes of the type [RuCp/Cp*(PP) (η 2 -H 2) ][OTf] (PP = 1, 2 -bis(diarylphosphino) ethane, 1, 2 -bis(diarylphosphino) methane, 1, 2 -bis(dialkylphosphino) methane) bearing elongated H 2 ligand (dHH = 1. 0 to 1. 17 Å); in this series of complexes as well, we found that the H−H bond distances increased as the donor ability of the chelating phosphines increased in small increments, along the reaction coordinate <b>for</b> the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of H 2 to a metal center.

40|$|We show quantum {{chemically}} that, {{contrary to}} common believe, bulky ligands in d 10 -ML 2 complexes may enhance, instead of counteract, L-M-L bite-angle bending.

This follows from our quantum chemical {{analyses of the}} bonding in and reactivity of bisphosphine palladium complexes Pd(PR 3) 2 with varying steric bulk, based on relativistic dispersion-corrected DFT computations {{in combination with the}} activation strain model and quantitative MO theory. Ligands that are large but to some extent flat (instead of isotropically bulky) are shown to build up relatively strong dispersion interactions between their large surfaces ("sticky pancakes") when they bend toward each other. The resulting stabilization, a form of steric attraction, favors bending and thus enhances bite-angle flexibility. This leads to surprisingly low reaction barriers for methane C-H activation by the rather congested Pd(PCy 3) 2 and Pd(PPh 3) 2 model catalysts. Our findings not only explain the unexpected nonlinear L-M-L angles observed in crystallographic data but also more generally demonstrate the importance of dispersion interactions in realistic catalyst complexes.

To understand this reaction, several kinetic studies employing simple aryl halide and amine coupling partners were performed to elucidate unknown reaction pathways. Chapter 1. The resting state for the palladium catalyzed cross-coupling of various diarylamines and aryl halides {{is found to be}} the diphenylamido complex. Kinetic studies of the catalytic reaction are used to generate an Eyring plot. Hammett studies were performed for both the aryl halide and diarylamine coupling partners. The rates of reductive elimination for catalysts based on the biaryl ligands XPhos, CyJohnPhos, CPhos, BrettPhos, RuPhos, and SPhos were evaluated. Analogues of SPhos demonstrated that electron-donation of the lower aryl group is key to the stability of the amido complex in accordance with theoretical calculations. The methoxy substituent at the C 3 position is demonstrated to retard the overall rate of reductive elimination for a RuPhos-BrettPhos hybrid ligand. These studies demonstrate that reductive elimination is likely not a problematic step for C-N cross-couplings. Chapter 2. Kinetic experiments demonstrated an inverse dependence on the concentration of both amine and aryl halide coupling partners. These observations are demonstrated to be valid for several amine classes, aryl halides, and biaryl ligands. Some work is done to demonstrate mechanistic overlap with other bidentate ligands.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{mechanistic}} studies reported here has revealed fundamental {{information about the}} individual steps of palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions. In one case, {{the oxidative addition of}} PhX (X = I, Br, Cl) to the complexes Pd(PtBu 3) 2 (1), Pd(1 -AdPtBu 2) 2 (2), Pd(CyPtBu 2) 2 (3), and Pd(PCy 3) 2 (4) (1 -Ad = 1 -adamantyl, Cy = cyclohexyl) was studied to determine the effect of steric properties on the coordination number of the species that undergoes oxidative addition and to determine whether the type of halide affects the identity of this species. The kinetic data imply that the number of phosphines coordinated to the complex that reacts in the irreversible step of the oxidative addition process for complexes 1 ??? 4 depends more on the halide than on the steric properties of the ligands. The rate-limiting step of the oxidative addition of PhI occurred with L 2 Pd(0) in all cases, as determined by the lack of dependence of kobs on [PtBu 3], [1 -AdPtBu 2], or [CyPtBu 2] and the inverse dependence of the rate constant on [PCy 3] when the reaction was initiated with Pd(PCy 3) 3. The irreversible step of the oxidative addition of PhCl occurred with a monophosphine species in each case, as signaled by an inverse dependence of the rate constant on the concentration of ligand. The irreversible step of the oxidative addition of PhBr occurred with a bisphosphine species, as signaled by the zeroth-order or small dependence of the rate constant on the concentration of phosphine. Thus, the additions of the less reactive chloroarenes occur through lower-coordinate intermediates than additions of the more reactive haloarenes. An unusual autocatalytic mechanism <b>for</b> <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of bromobenzene to Pd(PtBu 3) 2 was also observed when reactions were run in the absence of strong base. Studies on the effect of various additives showed that the degree of rate acceleration followed the trend: (PtBu 3) Pd(Ph) (Br) ??? (HPtBu 3) Br < [(PtBu 3) Pd(??-Br) ] 2 < (PtBu 3) 2 Pd(H) (Br). Studies on the reactions of Pd(PtBu 3) 2 in the presence of (PtBu 3) 2 Pd(H) (Br) showed that the concentration of (PtBu 3) 2 Pd(H) (Br) decreased only after the Pd(0) complex had been consumed. These data indicated that the catalyst in this process is (PtBu 3) 2 Pd(H) (Br). Thermal decomposition of the three-coordinate oxidative addition product (PtBu 3) Pd(Ar) (Br) during the reaction of Pd(PtBu 3) 2 and bromoarenes ultimately leads to formation of (PtBu 3) 2 Pd(H) (Br). Parallel reactions of bromobenzene with (PtBu 3) 2 Pd(H) (Br) and Pd(PtBu 3) 2 showed that the bromoarenes reacted considerably faster with the Pd(II) species than with the Pd(0) species. We therefore propose a catalytic cycle <b>for</b> <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> in which PtBu 3 ???HBr reacts with the Pd(0) species to form (PtBu 3) 2 Pd(H) (Br), and (PtBu 3) 2 Pd(H) (Br) reacts with the bromoarene, possibly though the anionic species [HPtBu 3 +][(PtBu 3) Pd(Br) ???], to form [Pd(PtBu 3) (Ar) (Br) ]. In a separate study, the isolation and reactivity of a series of ???ligandless,??? anionic arylpalladium complexes of the general structure [Pd(Ar) Br 2] 22 ??? were conducted. These anionic complexes insert olefins at room temperature, and these fast insertions indicate that the anionic complexes are kinetically competent to be intermediates in Heck???Mizoroki reactions conducted under ???ligandless??? conditions (lacking added dative ligand). Kinetic studies showed that the anionic complexes insert olefins much faster than the corresponding neutral, P(t-Bu) 3 -ligated complexes. Addition of halide to the reaction of the neutral complex (tBu 3 P) Pd(Ar) (Br) and styrene led to a significant rate acceleration, suggesting that the anionic complex forms rapidly and reversibly in situ from the neutral species prior to migratory insertion. These data, along with studies on the regioselectivity for reaction of aryl halides with butyl vinyl ether {{in the presence of the}} different starting catalysts, are consistent with the intermediacy of the same anionic, arylpalladium intermediates in Heck reactions catalyzed by palladium complexes containing bulky trialkylphosphine ligands as in reactions conducted under ligandless conditions. Lastly, a systematic study of the stoichiometric reactions of isolated arylpalladium hydroxo and halide complexes with arylboronic acids and aryltrihydroxyborates was conducted to evaluate the relative rates of the two reaction pathways commonly proposed to account for transmetallation in the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction. Based on the relative populations of the palladium and organoboron species generated under conditions common for the catalytic process and the observed rate constants for the stoichiometric reactions between the two classes of reaction components, we conclude that the reaction of a palladium hydroxo complex with boronic acid, not the reaction of a palladium halide complex with trihydroxyborate, accounts for transmetallation in catalytic Suzuki-Miyaura reactions conducted with weak base and aqueous solvent mixtures...|$|E

The formation of a carboxylic acid from the toluene solution of a ditelluride d palladium(O) complex {{in the presence of}} light oxygen (from air) is demonstrated. When the solvent employed is p-xylene an aldehyde is formed. The reaction proceeds via the free radical, RTeO, with Pd(PPh 3) 4 as a catalyst. It has also been shown that the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids is catalysed by ditelluride. Spin trapping experiments with PhCH=N(O) But (phenyl-t-butyl-nitrone) have provided evidence that the oxidative addition of an alkyl halide (RX=Mei, BunBr, BusecBr, ButBr, BrCH 2 -CH=CHCH 2 Br, and Br(CH 2) 4 Br) to diphenyltelluride and reductive elimination of CH 3 SCN from Ph 2 (CH 3) Te(NCS) proceeds via radical pathways. A mechanism is proposed <b>for</b> <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> which involves the preformation of a charge transfer complex of alkyl halide and diphenyltelluride. The first step is the formation of a charge transfer complex, and the initial product of the oxidative addition is a "covalent" form of the tellurium(IV) compound. When the radical R is more stable, Ph 2 TeX 2 may be the major tellurium(IV) product. The reaction of RTeNa (R=p-EtOC 6 H 4, Ph) with organic dihalides X 2 (CH 2) n (n= 1, 2, 3, 4) affords telluronium salts (n= 3, 4; X=Cl, Br) the nature of which is discussed.

First {{a brief overview of}} solid 2 state NMR and its relevance to the various areas of chemistry covered in this thesis is given. Following the synthesis, immobilization, and characterization of tridentate phosphine ligands, EtOSi[(CH 2) nPPh 2] 3 (n = 4, 7, 11) and [MeP((CH 2) nPPh 2) 3]+I? (n = 4, 7, 11) on silica is detailed. Both, immobilization by electrostatic interactions and by a covalent siloxane bond to the support, is studied and compared. Ligand exchange with Wilkinson?s catalyst affords immobilized Rh complexes. These materials are applied to catalytic olefin hydrogenation. In either case active hydrogenation catalysts are obtained that can easily and efficiently be recycled up to 30 times. Detailed investigations reveal that irrespective of the linkage to the support the catalysts consist initially of well 2 defined molecular species that form supported Rh nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution {{in the course of the}} catalytic reaction. The nanoparticles are active hydrogenation catalysts as well, and no metal leaching into solution is detected. The reaction of the tridentate phosphine ligands EtOSi[(CH 2) 2 PPh 2] 3 and MeSi[(CH 2) 2 PPh 2] 3 with Rh and Ir complexes is investigated. This reaction does not lead to the anticipated Wilkinson 2 type complexes with the metal in the +I oxidation state, but instead to oxidative addition of the C(sp 3) 2 Si bond to Rh or Ir centers to yield octahedral complexes with the metal in the +III oxidation state. These complexes are fully characterized by multinuclear NMR in solution and in the solid state. Preliminary density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate the preference <b>for</b> <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition.</b> Subsequently the study of performance thermoplastics which are important materials for the oil and gas industry is presented. The polymer morphology is studied by solid 2 state NMR techniques. Special attention is devoted to potential decomposition pathways at elevated temperatures for polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) polymers. 13 C CP/MAS (cross polarization with magic angle spinning) NMR and IR spectroscopy reveal that PEEK polymers show no detectable chemical change on the molecular level, while PPS polymers display signs of oxidation of the thioether group and branching via formation of ether, thioether, and biphenyl linkages.

40|$|Chapter 1 A {{procedure}} for forming a highly active Pd(0) catalyst from Pd(OAc) 2, water, and biarylphosphine ligands has been developed. This protocol generates a catalyst system, which exhibits excellent reactivity and efficiency in the coupling {{of a variety}} of amides and anilines with aryl chlorides. Chapter 2 A new class of one-component Pd precatalysts bearing biarylphosphine ligands is described. These precatalysts are air- and thermally-stable, are easily-activated under normal reaction conditions at or below room temperature, and ensure the formation of the highly-active mono-ligated Pd(0) complex necessary <b>for</b> <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition.</b> The use of these precatalysts as a convenient source of LPd(0) in C-N cross-coupling reactions is explored. The reactivity that is demonstrated in this study is unprecedented in palladium chemistry. Chapter 3 A catalyst system based on a new biarylphosphine ligand that shows excellent reactivity for C-N cross-coupling reactions is reported. This catalyst system enables the use of aryl mesylates as a coupling partner in C-N bond-forming reactions. Additionally, the use of this ligand permits the highly selective monoarylation of an array of primary aliphatic amines and anilines at low catalyst loadings and with fast reaction times, including the first monoarylation of methylamine. Lastly, oxidative addition complexes based on the new ligand are included, which provide insight into the origin of reactivity for this system. Chapter 4 An investigation into the Pd-catalyzed C-N cross-coupling reactions of aryl iodides is described. Neal is shown to have a significant inhibitory effect on these processes. By switching to a solvent system in which the iodide byproduct was insoluble, reactions of aryl iodides were accomplished with the same efficiencies as aryl chlorides and bromides. Using catalyst systems based on certain biarylphosphine ligands, aryl iodides were successfully reacted with an array of primary and secondary amines in high yields. Lastly, reactions of heteroarylamines and heteroaryliodides were also conducted in high yields. Chapter 5 A catalyst based on a new biarylphosphine ligand for the Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions of amides and aryl chlorides is described. This system shows the highest turnover frequencies reported to date for these reactions, especially for aryl chloride substrates bearing an ortho substituent. An array of amides and aryl chlorides were successfully reacted in good to excellent yields. Chapter 6. An efficient Pd-catalyst for the transformation of aryl chlorides, triflates and nonaflates to nitroaromatics has been developed. This reaction proceeds under weekly basic conditions and displays a broad scope and excellent functional group compatibility. Moreover, this method allows for the synthesis of aromatic nitro compounds that cannot be accessed efficiently via other nitration protocols. Mechanistic insight into the trasmetallation step of the catalytic process is also reported. Chapter 7. An alternative approach to catalyst development, which led to a Pd catalyst based on two biarylphosphine ligands for C-N cross-coupling reactions, is reported. By effectively being able to take the form of multiple catalysts this system manifests the best properties that catalysts based on either of the two ligands exhibit separately and displays the highest reactivity and substrate scope of any system that has been reported to date for these reactions. by Brett P.

40|$|Significant {{developments}} {{have been made}} in the field of C–H activation. However, various disadvantages, mainly low reactivity and selectivity, limit their usage in large-scale synthesis. It is crucial to understand the mechanisms and the nature of the transient species involved in the C–H activation paths to develop effective catalytic routes for homogeneous C–H functionalization reactions. Computational techniques are employed in this study to throw light on these processes. Chapter 1 briefly introduces C–H activation and functionalization reactions. After classifying the reactions on the basis of mechanisms, computational studies on the mechanisms of C–H activation reactions are described. The challenges involved in the discovery of efficient homogeneous C–H functionalization catalysts and progress made in the field are discussed. The insights provided to overcome the problems associated with the catalytic C–H functionalization reactions in a few examples are highlighted. In Chapter 2, DFT model studies are carried out to estimate the affinity and selectivity of 16 -electron half-sandwich d 6 -metal fragments (η 5 –C 5 H 5) Re(CO) 2 and (η 6 –C 6 H 6) W(CO) 2 for binding with alkane C–H bonds. Different C–H binding sites of pentane, at the M 06 level of theory have been evaluated. The effects of ancillary ligand variations on the metal–pentane binding strength are studied by substituting different ligands such as N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC), PF 3 and NO+ for one of the carbonyl ligands. Isomers of the metal-pentane C–H σ-complexes studied in this chapter are shown in Scheme 1. Binding energies of the terminal methyl C–H bonds (C 1 and C 5) are significantly lower than those of the methylene C–H bonds (C 2, C 3 and C 4) in all the cases. The metal–pentane binding interactions of the rhenium complexes are significantly stronger than those of the corresponding tungsten analogs. The PF 3 complexes have slightly greater binding energies compared to the CO complexes, in both Re(I) and W(0) analogs. These results are in conformity with the experimental results. The electron-deficient nitrosyl complexes have the highest binding energies. These results illustrate that by proper tuning of the electronic factors of the transition-metal fragments with different ancillary ligands, the alkane C–H binding affinity can be controlled. Energy decomposition analyses (EDA) are carried out to determine the nature of the interaction between the metal fragments and pentane C–H bonds. Scheme 1. Formation of pentane C–H σ-complexes Chapter 3 addresses the energetics of various intramolecular site-exchange (chain walking) processes and C–H oxidative addition reactions (Scheme 2) of the pentane C–H σ-complexes studied in Chapter 2. Four possible site-exchange processes such as 1, 2 -, 1, 3 -, 1, 4 - and 1, 5 -migration processes are studied using DFT/M 06 level of theory. η 2 -(H,H) ···M type transition states are located for these migrations (Scheme 2). The 1, 3 -migration is the most favorable process. Two different pentyl hydride isomers, as shown in Scheme 2, are obtained <b>for</b> <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of methyl and methylene C–H bonds of pentane for all systems, at same level of theory. Oxidative insertion of metal into the methyl C–H bonds is more favorable than insertion into the methylene C–H bonds for all complexes. The activation energies of all site-exchange and C–H oxidative addition processes of the Re(I) complexes are significantly greater than those of the corresponding W(0) complexes. For all these processes, the activation barriers of the electron-deficient NO+ complexes are the greatest among all ligand systems studied, in both Re(I) and W(0) systems. These results are consistent with the experimental results and suggest that the experimentally observed pentyl hydride isomer [(η 5 –C 5 H 5) Re(CO) (PF 3) H(C 5 H 11) ] might be Isomer B and not Isomer A (Scheme 2). The C–H oxidative addition reactions are less favorable than dynamic site-exchange processes in all complexes. These results imply that the metal fragments migrate along the pentane chain more easily than insert into the pentane C–H bonds. Scheme 2. Alkane chain walking and C–H oxidative addition reactions Chapter 4 deals with the mechanisms and energetics of a unique metal migration process of an olefin complex that proceeds via olefinic (C–H) ···Metal interaction. Migration of the Re(I) fragment from one π face of the olefin to the opposite π face in [(η 5 –C 5 H 5) Re(NO) (PPh 3) (PhCH═CH 2) ]+ has been documented experimentally by Gladysz and coworkers. The experimental results provide evidences for an intramolecular mechanism for this process (i. e., without styrene dissociation from Re(I)) and based on kinetic isotope effects (KIE), the involvement of a trans C–H bond is indicated. Either oxidative addition or a vinylic (C–H) ···Re interaction could account for the experimentally observed kinetic isotope effect. In this study, the free energy of activation for the migration of Re from one enantioface of the olefin to the other through various pathways is computed using DFT calculations at the B 3 LYP and M 06 levels. Two pathways, one that involves migration of Re through a trans (C–H) ···Re interaction and another that involves oxidative addition of Re into the trans C–H bond, are identified as possible paths (Scheme 3) at the B 3 LYP level. Surprisingly, at the M 06 level, DFT computes a lower energy path for the conducted tour mechanism that is not consistent with the experimental KIE. But the computed energy profiles for the reaction are consistent with the experiment when computations are carried out at the B 3 LYP level. Scheme 3. Mechanisms of olefin π face exchange reaction In Chapter 5, the mechanistic studies of C–H metathesis of d 6 half-sandwich complex [(η 5 –C 5 Me 5) Ru(CH 3) (CO) (C 6 H 6) ] are discussed. A 1 -step mechanism that proceeds via a four-center transition state and a 2 -step Oxidative Addition and Reductive Coupling mechanism (OA/RC) are identified as possible mechanisms (Scheme 4) using DFT/M 06 level of theory. The 1 -step mechanism is more favorable than the 2 -step mechanism. As in the oxidative addition intermediate, metal–hydrogen bond is observed in the four-center transition state of the 1 -step mechanism. This mechanism is referred to as Oxidative Hydrogen Migration (OHM) rather than σ-Bond Metathesis (σ-BM) which proceeds via a transition state without M−H bonding. The effects of metal (M = Fe(II), Ru(II) or Os(II)) and ancillary ligand (L = H–, NHC, CO or NO+) variations on the mechanisms and energetics of the model Cp complex [(η 5 –C 5 H 5) M(CH 3) (L) (C 6 H 6) ] are also studied (Scheme 4). Scheme 4. Oxidative hydrogen migration vs Oxidative addition/reductive coupling Increase in the electron-density on the metal center, using electron-donating ligands such as H−, favors the formation of the oxidative species (intermediate or transition state) and reduces the activation barriers of the C–H metathesis reaction. Similarly, the electron-withdrawing NO+ ligand, which reduces the electron density on the metal center, increases the activation energies of the C–H metathesis reaction or disfavors the formation of the oxidative species. Factor affecting the choice of the mechanism of the C–H metathesis reaction is found to be the net charge transfer between the two fragments [(η 5 –C 5 H 5) M(CH 3) (L) ] and benzene in [(η 5 –C 5 H 5) M(CH 3) (L) (C 6 H 6) ]. The computational studies reported in this thesis provide valuable insight into the mechanisms and energetics of C–H binding, activation and fluxional processes of the (C–H) ···Metal σ alkane and alkene complexes. These studies will be helpful in solving problems associated with the C–H activation reactions. Reference Thenraj, M.; Samuelson, A. G. Organometallics 2013, 32, 7141.

Complex formation proved difficult and experimental attempts to overcome possible side reactions caused by reactant-metal interactions were unsuccessful.

Theoretical calculations <b>for</b> the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of azolium salts to a model Wilkinson's catalyst (RhCl(PH 3) 3) is described. According to free energy calculations, a six ligand associative route with a concerted three-centred transition structure may be competitive to a route in which phosphine predissociation occurs. Exchange of the phosphine molecule on the metal centre with trimethylphosphine had a significant effect in lowering the barrier to <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> and decreasing the endothermicity of the reaction, while explicit and bulk solvation was found to have a moderate effect on the overall reaction. Extension of the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of azolium salts to rhodium carbene complexes have been examined, in which a range of ligands is described from the pi-acidic carbon monoxide ligand to multiple carbene ligands. Increasing basicity decreases activation barriers while increasing the exothermicity of the overall reaction for C-H activation, however the complex most successful at C-H activation was not considered hospitable enough for related C-C activation of 2 -methylazolium salts. Switching to iridium indicated a large benefit in C-H activation. Unfortunately, C-C activation remained unfavourable for iridium due to a high barrier to reaction. A mechanism for the experimentally successful C-C coupling of azolium salts to alkenes by nickel complexes is studied, indicating an <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition,</b> alkene insertion and reductive elimination cycle seems likely. Experimentally, the switching of catalytically active phosphine ligands to the related carbenes causes the reaction to be halted. Theoretical calculations imply minor changes to reaction conditions may significantly affect the outcome of catalytic reactions by stabilisation of important reaction intermediates. Further studies of the alternative C 4 activation of the azolium salts and use of related azoles show C 4 activation and coupling may be possible, while the unactivated azoles are unlikely to be coupled using the same mechanism.

These two reaction pathways described here are route 1, which is designated as an insertion-addition pathway, and route 2, an addition-insertion pathway. Elementary steps for both reaction pathways, including the amino group migration to the Co-CO bond, additional NH 2 CH 3 molecule association, <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of the coordinated amine proton to the cobalt center, and reductive elimination of -C(=O) NHCH 3 with -NH 2 CH 3, are modeled and examined. Rather small energies for activation (DeltaG(double dagger)), 2. 3 and 2. 1 kcal/mol for routes 1 and 2, respectively, are observed for the process of amino group migration and the formation of the Co-carbamyl bond in both routes. The results are in contrast to the alkyl group migration in RCo(CO) (4) cases, in which much higher energies are required. The <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> process of the N-H bond is established as the rate-determining step (rds) for both routes, and the activation energies DeltaG(double dagger) are 49. 2 and 56. 8 kcal/mol for routes 1 and 2, respectively.
