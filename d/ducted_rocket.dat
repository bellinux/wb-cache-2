50|$|In a <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket,</b> a {{solid fuel}} gas {{generator}} produces a hot fuel-rich gas which is burnt in the ramcombustor with the compressed air {{supplied by the}} intake(s). The flow of gas improves the mixing of the fuel and air and increases total pressure recovery. In a throttleable <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket,</b> {{also known as a}} variable flow <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket,</b> a valve allows the gas generator exhaust to be throttled allowing control of the thrust. Unlike an LFRJ, solid propellant ramjets cannot flame out. The <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket</b> sits somewhere between the simplicity of the SFRJ and the unlimited throttleability of the LFRJ.|$|E
50|$|Air-augmented rockets (also {{known as}} rocket-ejector, ramrocket, <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket,</b> {{integral}} rocket/ramjets, or ejector ramjets) use the supersonic exhaust {{of some kind}} of rocket engine to further compress air collected by ram effect during flight to use as additional working mass, leading to greater effective thrust for any given amount of fuel than either the rocket or a ramjet alone.|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of metal particles, like Aluminum or Boron, to typically used hydrocarbon binder {{is an interesting}} topic for advanced propulsion system like air breathing ramjet engines, <b>ducted</b> <b>rockets</b> and so on; in fact {{this is due to}} higher gravimetric and volumetric combustion heat capacity of metal additive in comparision with conventional solid fluids.

50|$|The RBCC, or Rocket-Based Combined Cycle {{propulsion}} system, {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of propulsion systems that may be tested in the Boeing X-43 experimental aircraft.

5000|$|Prior to August 1945, the Vultee Division of Consolidated-Vultee {{looked at}} the {{possibility}} of a swept-wing aircraft powered by a <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket.</b> Years earlier, the company had performed designs which involved liquid-cooled radiator engines. If this design, fuel would be added to the heat produced by small rocket engines in the duct, creating a [...] "pseudo-ramjet".|$|E
50|$|The {{propulsion}} sub-system (PSS) is a Throttleable <b>Ducted</b> <b>Rocket</b> (TDR) with {{an integrated}} nozzleless booster, designed and manufactured by Bayern-Chemie. TDR propulsion provides a long range, a high average speed, a wide operational envelope from sea level to high altitude, a flexible mission envelope via active variable thrust control, relatively simple design, and logistics {{similar to those}} of conventional solid-fuel rocket motors.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the control of}} gas generator pressure in throttleable <b>ducted</b> <b>rockets</b> using nonlinear adaptive control as well as classical control approaches. Simulation results using the full nonlinear and time-varying dynamics of the gas generator are reported in both classical controller and adaptive controller cases. "Closed-loop Reference Model" structure is used together with the adaptive controller to improve transient response. Controllers are simulated to test their robustness by introducing uncertinities, disturbances and noise to the system. Cold Air Test Plant (CATP) is used as the test facility to compare the controllers and validate the results from simulations. Moreover, damping effect of CRM to oscillations in adaptive controller case is observed in CATP tests. © 2015 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|As with ducted jet engines, {{matching}} the exhaust speed and the vehicle speed gives optimum efficiency in principle.

40|$|Research {{conducted}} under Air Force Contract F 33615 - 76 -C- 2043 {{to generate}} cost data {{and to establish}} a cost methodology that accurately predicts the production costs of ramjet engines is presented. The cost handbook contains a description of over one hundred and twenty-five different components which are defined as baseline components. The cost estimator selects from the handbook the appropriate components to fit his ramjet assembly, computes the cost from cost computation data sheets in the handbook, and totals all of the appropriate cost elements {{to arrive at the}} total engine cost. The methodology described in the cost handbook addresses many different ramjet types from simple podded arrangements of the liquid fuel ramjet to the more complex integral rocket/ramjet configurations including solid fuel ramjets and solid <b>ducted</b> <b>rockets.</b> It is applicable to a range of sizes from 6 in diameter to 18 in diameter and to production quantities up to 5000 engines...|$|R
50|$|In August 1945, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), {{soon to be}} {{renamed the}} United States Air Force, issued a {{proposal}} for a supersonic interceptor capable of 700 mi/h km/h speeds and reaching an altitude of 50000 ft in four minutes. Several companies responded, among which was Consolidated-Vultee, which submitted its design on 13 October 1945. This design featured swept wings and V-tails, as well as a powerful propulsion system. Besides the <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket,</b> four 1,200 lbf kN rockets were positioned at the exhaust nozzle, along with the 1,560 lbf kN 19XB turbojet produced by Westinghouse.|$|E
50|$|It entered {{service in}} the Swedish air force in April 2016, with the SwAF as the first {{operator}} of the missile due to most testing having been done on the JAS-39. It officially achieved initial operating capability (IOC) with Swedish air force Gripens in July 2016, and it was announced at the Farnborough Air Show that the Czech air force would soon reach IOC as well. According to MBDA, Meteor has three to six times the kinematic performance of current air-air missiles of its type. The key to Meteor's performance is a throttleable <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket</b> (ramjet) manufactured by Bayern-Chemie of Germany.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Government {{agreed to}} {{transfer}} {{development of the}} advanced propulsion system to the UK {{in support of the}} Hughes bid, although it was not clear how much of the actual work would be allowed across the Atlantic. Hughes' initial offering for SR(A)1239 was powered by a variable-flow <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket</b> (VFDR). This had been under development by an Atlantic Research/Alliant Techsystems team for ten years but the USAF had no plans at that time, to develop an extended range AMRAAM since this could endanger support for the stealthy F-22 Raptor. The team had also provided information to BAe who were considering the VFDR as a powerplant for the S225XR, along with systems from Bayern Chemie and Volvo. Atlantic Research had discussions with Royal Ordnance, the only UK company with the necessary capability following Rolls-Royce's decision to stop work on ramjets.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{include both}} <b>duct</b> engines and <b>rocket</b> engines, and more {{uncommon}} variations such as Hall effect thrusters, ion drives and mass drivers. Duct engines are obviously not used for space propulsion {{due to the}} lack of air; however some proposed spacecraft have these kinds of engines to assist takeoff and landing.|$|R
50|$|Jet engines can be run {{on almost}} any fuel. Hydrogen {{is a highly}} {{desirable}} fuel, as, although the energy per mole is not unusually high, the molecule is very much lighter than other molecules. The energy per kg of hydrogen is twice that of more common fuels and this gives twice the specific impulse. In addition, jet engines running on hydrogen are quite easy to build - the first ever turbojet was run on hydrogen. Also, although not <b>duct</b> engines, hydrogen-fueled <b>rocket</b> engines have seen extensive use.|$|R
40|$|Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has {{considerably}} {{evolved in}} the last decade. There are many computer programs that can perform computations on viscous internal or external flows with chemical reactions. CFD has become a commonly used tool {{in the design and}} analysis of gas turbines, ramjet combustors, turbo-machinery, inlet <b>ducts,</b> <b>rocket</b> engines, jet interaction, missile, and ramjet nozzles. One of the problems of interest to NASA has always been the performance prediction for rocket and air-breathing engines. Due to the complexity of flow in these engines it is necessary to resolve the flowfield into a fine mesh to capture quantities like turbulence and heat transfer. However, calculation on a high-resolution grid is associated with a prohibitively increasing computational time that can downgrade the value of the CFD for practical engineering calculations. The Liquid Thrust Chamber Performance (LTCP) code was developed for NASA/MSFC (Marshall Space Flight Center) to perform liquid rocket engine performance calculations. This code is a 2 D/axisymmetric full Navier-Stokes (NS) solver with fully coupled finite rate chemistry and Eulerian treatment of liquid fuel and/or oxidizer droplets. One of the advantages of this code has been the resemblance of its input file to the JANNAF (Joint Army Navy NASA Air Force Interagency Propulsion Committee) standard TDK code, and its automatic grid generation for JANNAF defined combustion chamber wall geometry. These options minimize the learning effort for TDK users, and make the code a good candidate for performing engineering calculations. Although the LTCP code was developed for liquid rocket engines, it is a general-purpose code and has been used for solving many engineering problems. However, the single zone formulation of the LTCP has limited the code to be applicable to problems with complex geometry. Furthermore, the computational time becomes prohibitively large for high-resolution problems with chemistry, two-equation turbulence model, and two-phase flow. To overcome these limitations, the LTCP code is rewritten to include the multi-zone capability with domain decomposition that makes it suitable for parallel processing, i. e., enabling the code to run every zone or sub-domain on a separate processor. This can reduce the run time by a factor of 6 to 8, depending on the problem...|$|R
50|$|Integrated {{boosters}} {{provide a}} more efficient packaging option, since the booster propellant is cast inside the otherwise empty combustor. This approach has been used on solid, for example SA-6 Gainful, liquid, for example ASMP, and <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket,</b> for example Meteor, designs. Integrated designs are complicated by the different nozzle requirements of the boost and ramjet phases of flight. Due to the higher thrust levels of the booster, a differently shaped nozzle is required for optimum thrust compared to that required for the lower thrust ramjet sustainer. This is usually achieved via a separate nozzle, which is ejected after booster burnout. However, designs such as Meteor feature nozzleless boosters. This offers the advantages of elimination of the hazard to launch aircraft from the ejected boost nozzle debris, simplicity, reliability, and reduced mass and cost, although this must be traded against the reduction in performance compared with that provided by a dedicated booster nozzle.|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} the analytical {{results of a}} parametric investigation of a launch concept of micro-satellites from a combat aircraft. The concept of air launching of a satellite from a carrier aircraft is not new; however, most designs consider heavy aircraft and launch vehicle to place a mini to a large satellite, typically launched today via ground-based rocket launchers. Documented air launcher designs usually incorporate a lift aided trajectory. It is the authors’ intention to present a method for air launching of a low-cost tactical micro-satellite, on demand, for various missions, using a weight economical vehicle via a Gravity Turn Trajectory. The carrier aircraft will be an F- 15 fighter, and the launcher will be a 3 -stage vehicle, assembled from a <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket</b> (ramrocket) 1 st stage and two solid propellant rocket stages. The option of an air-breathing engine for the first stage results from the high initial speed (as high as Mach 1. 6) provided to the launcher by the carrier aircraft. An air-breathing engine provides much higher energetic performance compared to a standard solid rocket motor (higher Isp and lower mass). A <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket</b> was chosen over other ramjet configurations for its higher thrust coefficient. Optimization on initial flight path angle, coasting time, and <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket</b> sizing was done.

First, the dynamic model of the gas regulating system for the <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket</b> was established, and comparison of the two regulating modes regarding non-linearity and uncertainty was done. In contrast with the area-regulated mode, the non-linearity of the pressure-balanced mode is smaller and the robustness is stronger.

The introduction of high-gain feedback suppresses the effects of non-linearity and uncertainty in the pneumatic servo system. Also, a proportional-integral controller for the gas regulating system based on linearmatrix inequality is designed. Lastly, an experimental investigation of the gas flow control system is done to verify the validity of the gas control system.

40|$|During the {{ignition}} of a <b>ducted</b> solid <b>rocket</b> motor (SRM), {{rapid expansion of}} injected hot gases from the motor into a confined volume causes {{the development of a}} steep fronted wave. This low frequency transient wave propagates outward from the exhaust duct, impinging the vehicle and ground structures. An unsuppressed overpressure wave can potentially cause modal excitation in the structures and vehicle, subsequently leading to damage. This presentation details {{the ignition}} transient f indings from the 5 % Ares I Scale Model Acoustic Test (ASMAT). The primary events of the ignition transient environment induced by the SRM are the ignition overpressure (IOP), duct overpressure (DOP), and source overpressure (SOP). The resulting observations include successful knockdown of the IOP environment through use of a Space Shuttle derived IOP suppression system, a potential load applied to the vehicle stemming from instantaneous asymmetrical IOP and DOP wave impingement, and launch complex geometric influences on the environment. The results are scaled to a full-scale Ares I equivalent and compared with heritage data including Ares I-X and both suppressed and unsuppressed Space Shuttle IOP environments...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results from}} a one day workshop on Rocket-Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) Engine Cycle Codes held in Monterey CA in November of 2000 at the 2000 JANNAF JPM with the authors as primary participants. The objectives of the workshop were to discuss and compare the merits of existing Rocket-Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) engine cycle codes being used by government and industry to predict RBCC engine performance and interpret experimental results. These merits included physical and chemical modeling, accuracy and user friendliness. The ultimate purpose of the workshop was to identify the best codes for analyzing RBCC engines and to document any potential shortcomings, not to demonstrate the merits or deficiencies of any particular engine design. Five cases representative of the operating regimes of typical RBCC engines were {{used as the basis}} of these comparisons. These included Mach 0 sea level static and Mach 1. 0 and Mach 2. 5 Air-Augmented-Rocket (AAR), Mach 4 subsonic combustion ramjet or dual-mode scramjet, and Mach 8 scramjet operating modes. Specification of a generic RBCC engine geometry and concomitant component operating efficiencies, bypass ratios, fuel/oxidizer/air equivalence ratios and flight dynamic pressures were provided. The engine included an air inlet, isolator <b>duct,</b> axial <b>rocket</b> motor/injector, axial wall fuel injectors, diverging combustor, and exit nozzle. Gaseous hydrogen was used as the fuel with the rocket portion of the system using a gaseous H 2 /O 2 propellant system to avoid cryogenic issues. The results of the workshop, even after post-workshop adjudication of differences, were surprising. They showed that the codes predicted essentially the same performance at the Mach 0 and I conditions, but progressively diverged from a common value (for example, for fuel specific impulse, Isp) as the flight Mach number increased, with the largest differences at Mach 8. The example cases and results are compared and discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The maximum {{performance}} of a supersonic inlet will be achieved when operating {{as close as possible}} to its buzz boundary. In order to maintain high performance without crossing the buzz boundary, an active buzz margin predictor and controller is necessary. The goal of a control system is to acquire inlet buzzmargin andmaintain it as the designated value and predict inlet buzz before it occurs and then take some measures to buzz mitigation or inlet restart. The inlet buzz boundary and themargin of ducted rocketswere first discussed and analysed. Then the dynamic mathematical model of a gas flow control system was established. Lastly, the inlet buzz margin controller of a <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket</b> was designed. Simulation results show that there exist anti-regulation characteristics for gas flow control for ducted rockets, and it leads to the particularity of inlet buzz margin control for ducted rockets in contrast to liquid ramjet. The designed inlet buzz margin has to be bigger to avoid the appearing of inlet buzz because of anti-regulation characteristics; otherwise, the inlet buzz phenomenon probably appears. If the inlet buzz of the <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket</b> appears, the command of decreasing fuel flow could not be given immediately; otherwise, the inlet buzz will aggravate...|$|E
40|$|Under a {{co-operative}} program, the Defence Research Establishment Valcartier and Université Laval in Canada and the TNO Prins Maurits Laboratory in the Netherlands {{have studied}} {{the use of a}} <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket</b> for missile propulsion. Hot-flow direct-connect combustion experiments using both simulated and solid fuels have been carried out {{on a wide range of}} configurations to identify the geometries and flow rates necessary for good combustor performance. The experiments using a simulated <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket</b> fuel, a reacted mixture of ethylene and air, have all been modelled using reacting flow Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with the goal of being able to analyze and predict combustor performance. The combustion was modelled with onestream and twostream PDF (Probability Density Function) models. With the onestream model, all of the fuel components, both gaseous and solid carbon, were injected together and were assumed to react instantaneously in the presence of the oxidizer. Because of this, the onestream model overpredicted the combustion efficiency with respect to the experimental results for most of the combustor configurations examined. With the twostream model, however, the fuel stream was separated into gaseous and solid carbon components, with the carbon injected as a series of 75 nm particles. These particles decompose gradually into carbon monoxide gas, based on a model using both the kinetics of the surface reactions and the diffusion of oxygen to the surface of the particles. For the majority of the configurations, better predictions of combustion efficiency were obtained with the twostream approach when compared to the experimental results than for the onestream PDF model. © 2001 by the Department of National Defence, Canada and TNO Prins Maurits Laboratory, the Netherlands...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the operation of a RBCC at ramjet and scramjet flight conditions using a direct-connect test facility. The apparatus being tested is a single strut-rocket within a dual-mode ram/scramjet combustor. The gaseous hydrogen/oxygen, linear strut-rocket was supplied by Aerojet Propulsion Company. The hardware is being tested in the Direct Connect Supersonic Combustion Test Facility at NASA Langley Research Center. The test facilities hydrogen/oxygen vitiated heater is capable of flight total enthalpies to Mach 8. A Mach 2. 5 facility nozzle mates the heater to the combustor <b>duct.</b> The <b>rocket</b> ejector will ordinarily operate in a fuel-rich mode. Additional fuel injection is provided by a pair of parallel injectors located at the base of the strut body. Instrumentation on the test apparatus includes a unique, direct thrust measurement system. Performance predictions for the anticipated test conditions have been made using a one-dimensional, thermodynamic analysis code. Results from the code show the dependence of overall thrust and specific impulse on rocket chamber pressure, rocket fuel equivalence ratio, and overall fuel equivalence ratio. Once the experimental test series begins, the inferred combustion efficiency as a function of axial location and the thermal choke region (where applicable) can also be determined using this code. Upon completion of the experimental test series, measurements will be used to calculate thrust, specific impulse, etc. Measured and calculated values will be compared to those found analytically. If appropriate, the code will be tailored to better predict hardware operation. Conclusions will be drawn as to the fuel-rich rocket's overall effect on ramjet and scramjet performance.

An ignition model of boron particles is formulated for the oxide layer removal by considering that it results from a boundary layer stripping mechanism. The shearing action exerted by the high-speed flow causes a boundary layer to be formed in the surface of the liquid oxide layer, and the stripping away of this layer accounts for the accelerated ignition of boron particles.

The Aerojet Strutjet RBCC concept consists of a variable geometry duct with internal, vertical struts that functions in <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket,</b> ramjet, scramjet, and pure rocket modes. These struts have rocket and turbine exhaust nozzles imbedded within them. The rocket flows create an ejector effect with the ingested air at subsonic flight velocities. In ramjet and scramjet modes, the fuel rich nozzle flows react with the ingested air producing an afterburner effect. Under a NASA Marshall Space Flight Center contract, the UAH Propulsion Research Center (PRC) has designed and built a Strutjet simulation facility. A scale model of a single strut has been built and is undergoing cold-flow testing to investigate the mixing of the rocket and turbine exhausts with the ingested air.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 67 - 73). Having variable thrust during {{the operation of}} a rocket provides tremendous advantages while chasing down a target. For ducted rockets, the key factor to obtain variable thrust is the precise pressure control inside the gas generator, {{which is one of}} the main elements of a throttleable <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket</b> and utilized to generate the fuel in gaseous form for combustion. However, the inherent nature of the system makes the control problem di cult due to time varying parameters, nonlinearities and time delays. Furthermore, disturbances and uncertainties exist due to challenging operation conditions. All these challenges make it necessary to design an advanced control approach. Therefore, a delay resistant closed loop reference model adaptive control is proposed in this thesis to address the control problem. The proposed controller combines delay compensation and adaptation with improved transient response. The controller is successfully implemented using an industrial grade cold air test setup, which is a milestone towards obtaining a fully developed throttleable rocket gas generator controller. Simulation and experimental comparisons with alternative adaptive approaches and a xed controller demonstrate improved performance and e ective handling of time delays and uncertainties.

40|$|The Variable-Flow <b>Ducted</b> <b>Rocket</b> (VFDR) {{is a type}} of ramjet {{that can}} control the fuel mass flow to the {{combustion}} chamber. It combines the high efficiency at high-speed of ramjets with the throttlability of turbofans, and this makes VFDR propulsion an excellent choice for high speed, long range missiles. This is especially true because the throttlability enables full flight optimisation, which has the potential to significantly increase the performance (range, terminal velocity, intercept time) with regard to standard ramjets. Previous work demonstrated mid-course guidance of a VFDR powered missile based on offline static flight range optimisation. Using this approach, flight transitions, that can have a large effect on performance, are never quite optimal, and optimisation goals other than range are non-trivial. Offline dynamic flight optimisations, which do incorporate transitions and allow other optimisation criteria, are not practical for use in guidance, because of the large amount of possible scenario's, especially when many target updates are sent. In this paper, the feasibility of online dynamic optimisation of the mid-course flight of a Meteor-like missile is demonstrated, that does not have the limitations of off-line optimisations. A Collocation method is applied to a two-phase non-linear programming problem, in order to optimise 2 controls of a 5 state missile model at intervals of several seconds. Several scenarios are presented, in which the effects are shown of different optimisation criteria, as well as the effects of changes in the target state.

40|$|Abstract: A {{model to}} analyse the {{heterogeneous}} combustion process {{that takes place}} in an axi-symmetric combustor of an air <b>ducted</b> <b>rocket</b> is presented, including radiation. The fuel, injected into the combustor through a simple injector, is a mixture of gaseous products, carbon particles, and MgO inert particles that results from the combustion of a solid fuel (HTPB-AP-Mg). The turbulence model used is the realizable k 21 model. The adopted reaction model is a reduced kinetic scheme composed of five reactions, three in gaseous phase and two heterogeneous. The model ‘finite rate/eddy dissipation model of Magnussen and Hjertager ’ is used to calculate the production terms in the gas phase, meanwhile the mixed model of Field, Baum, and Street is used for the oxidation reaction of carbon particles. After a detailed analysis of the numerical results, obtained with a commercial code for a specific combustor geometry and one set of boundary conditions both for the gaseous and solid phases, the existence of a special combustion pattern is found. It is composed of a turbu-lent diffusion jet flame attached to the injector, where only the gaseous fuel is burned, followed by a reaction region that envelops the jet of carbon particles at the aft of the combustion chamber. This jet of carbon particles oxidizes at a finite rate producing CO and CO 2. The emis-sion of CO and C(s) from the combustor is the main cause of high efficiency reduction. Radiation has little effect on calculated global variables, such as efficiency, mass flowrate, and total pressure loss, but on the contrary its effects on the temperature fields became important. Chilling of the gas phase was observed together with a reduction of solid particle temperature, however wall combustor temperature increased greatly. Simulation results are interpreted in the light of experimental observations and available numerical solutions in the literature...|$|E
