50|$|Gley {{soils are}} grouped under Gleysols in the FAO World Reference Base for Soil Resources. They exhibit a greenish-blue-grey soil color due to anoxic wetland conditions. On exposure, as the iron {{in the soil}} oxidizes colors are {{transformed}} to a mottled pattern of reddish, yellow or orange patches. During soil formation (gleying), the oxygen supply in the soil profile is restricted due to soil moisture at saturation. Anaerobic micro-organisms support cellular respiration by using alternatives to free oxygen as electron acceptors to support cellular respiration. Where Anaerobic organisms reduce ferric oxide to ferrous oxide, the reduced mineral compounds produce the <b>gley</b> <b>soil</b> typical color.

NEP subsequently declined from 9 t C ha− 1 year− 1, at closed canopy, to 2 t C ha− 1 year− 1 in older and thinned stands. Reductions in the C sequestration rate of older stands were coupled with a decrease in gross primary productivity, increases in maintenance/growth respiration and decomposition losses following harvest. We suggest that the high sequestration potential of these forests may be associated with the high net primary productivity of these plantations in Ireland, a high allocation of assimilates and litter into the belowground C pool and accumulation of C in mineral <b>gley</b> <b>soils</b> following afforestation...|$|R

We investigated {{the fate of a}} host-specific Salmonella bacteriophage and a nonreactive chemical (Br-) tracer when applied to large intact lysimeter soil cores (500 mm diam. by 700 mm high). The soils included a poorly drained <b>Gley</b> <b>Soil</b> and well-drained Pumice, Allophanic, and Recent Soils. A depth of 30 mm of water containing the bacteriophage and Br- was applied to the soil at a rate of 5 mm h- 1 followed by up to about 1. 8 pore volumes of simulated rainfall. Resulting leachates, collected continuously over at least one pore volume were analyzed for the bacteriophage and bromide (Br-) tracers. Bromide moved uniformly through the Pumice and Allophanic Soils with peak concentrations at about 1 pore volume, while the bacteriophage was detected only at trace levels or not at all. In contrast, both Br- and bacteriophage tracers moved rapidly through Gley and Recent Soils, appearing early in the leachate and then tailing off. Such flow patterns in the Gley and Recent Soils are indicative of bypass flow. Coarse soil structure in the <b>Gley</b> <b>Soil,</b> and finger-flow due to water repellency in the sandy Recent Soil are considered responsible for the observed bypass flow in these two soils. Allophanic and Pumice Soils have finer, more porous soil structure leading to a predominance of matrix flow over bypass flow.

Slug tests, constant-head borehole permeametry, and falling-head borehole permeametry were undertaken on established piezometers. Additionally, ring permeametry and two types of trench tests were evaluated. Method-related uncertainty due to proximity of impeding layers of high sorptivity soils produces under- and over-estimates of permeability {{by a factor of}} up to 0 Ð 2 and 5, respectively. This uncertainty band is smaller than the observed effects of anisotropy and temporal variability. Had smearing and soil-ring leakage errors not been minimized, the methodological uncertainties would have been so large that they would have distorted the true spatial field of permeability and its estimated impact on the balance of vertical and lateral flow.

40|$|Spatio-temporal {{variations}} in {{nitrogen and phosphorus}} concentrations in groundwater were analysed and related to the {{variations in}} hydrological conditions, vegetation type and substrate in an alluvial ecosystem. This {{study was conducted in}} the Illwald forest in the Rhine Plain (eastern France) to assess the removal of nutrients from groundwater in a regularly flooded area. We compared both forest and meadow ecosystems on clayey-silty soils with an anoxic horizon (pseudogley) at 1 • 5 – 2 m depth (eutric <b>gley</b> <b>soil)</b> and a forest ecosystem on a clayey-silty fluviosoil rich in organic matter with a gley at 0 • 5 m depth (calcaric <b>gley</b> <b>soil).</b> Piezometers were used to measure the nutrient concentrations in the groundwater at 2 m depth in the root layer and at 4 • 5 m depth, below the root layer. Lower concentrations of nitrate and phosphate in groundwater were observed under forest than under meadow, which could be explained by more efficient plant uptake by woody species than herbaceous plants. Thus NO 3 -N inputs by river floods were reduced by 73 % in the shallow groundwater of the forested ecosystem, and only by 37 % in the meadow. Compared with the superficial groundwater layer, the lowest level of nitrate nitrogen (NO 3 -N) and the highest level of ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 -N) were measured in the deep layer (under the gley horizon at 2 • 5 m depth), which suggests that the reducing potential of the anoxic horizon in the gley soils contributes to the reduction of nitrate. Nitrate concentrations were higher in the groundwater of the parcel rich in organic matter than in the one poorer in organic matter. Phosphate (PO 4 -P) concentrations in both shallow and deep groundwater are less than 62 to 76 % of those found in surface water which can be related to the retention capacity of the clay colloids of these soils. Moreover, the temporal variations in nutrient concentrations in groundwater are directly related to variations in groundwater level during an annual hydrological cycle. Our results suggest that variations in groundwater level regulate spatio-temporal variations in nutrient concentrations in groundwater {{as a result of the}} oxidation–reduction status of soil, which creates favourable or unfavourable conditions for nutrient bioavailability.

The removal of harvest residues decreased height growth in both years (p< 0. 05). Soil temperature fluctuations at 10 cm depth increased during the year in whole-tree harvested plots. Soils were warmer in spring and summer and cooler in autumn where residues had been removed and this response was considered most likely to favour tree growth. However, the removal of harvest residues increased mean annual windspeed at 30 cm above ground-level by 40 %. The sheltering effect of residues increased with increasing windspeed (r 2 = 0. 87).

40|$|The Fossil Forest Research Natural Area (FFRNA) in New Mexico is {{the site}} of an {{exceptionally}} preserved fossil forest of Campanian age. This study combines paleoecological, taxonomic, and sedimentological analy-sis, together with GIS mapping of 68 fossil tree stumps and nine fossil logs, in order to provide a detailed description of this forest. Wood analysis of stumps illustrates that the forest is almost exclusively composed of conifers most likely related to the Cupressaceae. Recon-struction of the forest indicates that the conifers were mature and widely spaced, creating an open canopy woodland; however, leaf litter directly associated with the fossil woodland has not been preserved, so the detailed composition of its understory remains enigmatic. Analysis of the substrate in which the stumps were rooted suggests that trees grew in a <b>gley</b> <b>soil</b> under wet floodplain conditions. Mean sensitivity analysis of growth rings in the stumps indicates that small-scale environmental disturbances on the floodplain, such as periodic flooding, or regional environmental distur-bances, such as volcanism, disrupted wood production. The death of the woodland was probably due to waterlogging and burial by suspended sediment associated with flooding. Despite the presumed dominance of angiosperms in disturbed, riparian environments during the Late Cretaceous, this study indicates that conifers were still dominant in some subenvironments at this time and could form mature open canopy woodlands on wet unstable floodplains...|$|E
40|$|Storm runoff in {{afforested}} catchments at LlynBrianne is acidic and Al-bearing. At baseflows, stream {{water is}} well-buffered with low Al levels. This paper {{presents the results}} of a study into how hydrologicalpathways account for these variations in stream-water chemistry. The investigation was carried out in the LI 1 catchment; a 0 · 4 -ha subcatchment covered by stagnohumic <b>gley</b> <b>soils</b> was monitored between October 1988 and September 1989. An instrumented hill-slope was established to identify the hydrologicalpathways that control the hydrochemistry of storm runoff draining from the subcatchment. Perched watertables developed in the surface horizons of the soil during storm episodes and produced lateral flow above the impeding subsoil. This near-surface flow path was responsible for generating acid, Al-rich storm runoff. Some water drained vertically through the soil profile into the underlying slope drift; seepage from groundwater in the drift sustained baseflows. Buffering reactions in the groundwater zone reduced the acidity and Al levels of baseflows. These hydrochemical characteristics are likely to be representative of other areas of stagnohumic <b>gley</b> <b>soils,</b> which cover 19 % of the LI 1 catchment: these soils may therefore provide a substantial source of acid, Al-bearing storm runoff in LI 1 and similar afforested catchment...|$|R
