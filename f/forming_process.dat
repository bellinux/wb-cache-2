To achieve this, the “pellet” is submerged into a very weak solution of acid and DC voltage is applied.

2500|$|Bassoon reeds, made of Arundo donax cane, {{are often}} {{made by the}} players themselves, {{although}} beginner bassoonists tend to buy their reeds from professional reed makers or use reeds made by their teachers. Reeds begin with a length of tube cane that is split into three or four pieces using a tool called a cane splitter. The cane is then trimmed and gouged to the desired thickness, leaving the bark attached. After soaking, the gouged cane is cut to the proper shape and milled to the desired thickness, or profiled, by removing material from the bark side. This {{can be done by}} hand with a file; more frequently it is done with a machine or tool designed for the purpose. After the profiled cane has soaked once again it is folded over in the middle. Prior to soaking, the reed maker will have lightly scored the bark with parallel lines with a knife; this ensures that the cane will assume a cylindrical shape during the forming stage. On the bark portion, the reed maker binds on one, two, or three coils or loops of brass wire to aid in the final <b>forming</b> <b>process.</b> The exact placement of these loops can vary somewhat depending on the reed maker. The bound reed blank is then wrapped with thick cotton or linen thread to protect it, and a conical steel mandrel (which sometimes has been heated in a flame) is quickly inserted in between the blades. Using a special pair of pliers, the reed maker presses down the cane, making it conform to the shape of the mandrel. (The steam generated by the heated mandrel causes the cane to permanently assume the shape of the mandrel.) The upper portion of the cavity thus created is called the [...] "throat," [...] and its shape has an influence on the final playing characteristics of the reed. The lower, mostly cylindrical portion will be reamed out with a special tool called a reamer, allowing the reed to fit on the bocal.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMetal <b>forming</b> <b>processes</b> today {{operate with}} astounding productivity, repeatably {{creating}} precise parts in high volumes {{out of the}} stock sheet and bar products of the upstream metals industries. This achievement has come through decades of development of ever stiffer and more precise tooling used in fast-acting tightly controlled equipment, and yet in the wider context of manufacturing, metal <b>forming</b> <b>processes</b> seem to be less effective: tooling costs are high, and can only be justified by large batch production; the parts made by metal forming are usually not as required for assembly, and must be processed in further downstream machining operations; current processes do not respond well to process disturbances such as tool wear or unanticipated variation in material properties; twenty years of laboratory development of new flexible <b>forming</b> <b>processes</b> has led to little industrial take-up, {{due to a lack}} of precision. The missing ingredient in forming which gives rise to these problems is the absence of effective closed-loop control of product properties. The normal practice for blacksmiths and craft workers in former times – using their personal senses to adjust processing in response to evolving conditions – has been forgotten in the pursuit of process rigidity. This paper therefore aims to motivate a new wave of interest in applying closed-loop control of product properties to metal <b>forming</b> <b>processes.</b> A novel framework is developed to show metal <b>forming</b> <b>processes</b> at the heart of an outer control loop, and existing applications are reviewed. Surveys of sensors, actuators and modelling techniques reveal a rich seam of opportunities for new developments, and the paper concludes with some suggestions about near term opportunities for applying closed-loop control of properties to metal <b>forming</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

To achieve these goals, metal <b>forming</b> <b>processes</b> need to be optimised.

More recently, the possibility of coupling FEM to optimisation algorithms is offering a very promising opportunity to design optimal metal <b>forming</b> <b>processes</b> instead of only feasible ones. However, the optimisation of metal <b>forming</b> <b>processes</b> is only very rarely applied within industry. Reasons for this are that (i) optimisation requires multiple time-consuming Finite Element simulations; (ii) {{it is difficult to}} select an appropriate optimisation algorithm for a certain optimisation problem; and (iii) it is difficult to model and select objective function, constraints and design variables that address industrial needs, e. g. a robust process. To bridge the gap between industrial interests and optimisation theory, we are developing an optimisation strategy for metal <b>forming</b> <b>processes</b> in cooperation with European metal forming industries.
