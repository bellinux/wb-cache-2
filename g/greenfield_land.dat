It is situated adjacent to the former facilities at Shenley Sports grounds, which Watford Football Club use for training purposes. They concluded it was “…essential to support the training facility”, that it would replace an existing building used by the club and that Arsenal’s community work “constituted exceptional circumstances”. The plans were referred to the Environment Secretary John Prescott, who ratified it, {{in spite of the}} area's position on the green belt. Planning permission was obtained in September 1998.|$|E

Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts {{across a range of}} measures, compared with those living in sprawling suburbs. In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s. The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of <b>greenfield</b> <b>land</b> take by urban sprawl.|$|E

Although the route, next to the railway and over the former Clifton colliery site, was chosen to minimise the clearance of occupied land, Yatefield, Olive Mount and Whittlefield Mills, Burnley Barracks, and several hundred more terrace houses had to be demolished. Unusually this route passed close to the town centre and had a partitioning effect on the districts of Gannow, Ightenhill, Whittlefield, Rose Grove and Lowerhouse to the north. The 1980s and 1990s saw massive expansion of Ightenhill and Whittlefield. Developers such as Bovis, Barratt and Wainhomes built large housing estates, predominantly on <b>greenfield</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E

This has put {{continuing}} pressure on the city council to approve development applications for subdivisions outside of the city fringe. In response to lobbying by landholders, the Ballarat West Growth Area Plan, a major <b>greenfield</b> <b>land</b> development plan, was prepared and has approved by the city and state government to allow for planned fringe communities consisting of 14,000 new homes and up to 40,000 new residents, effectively doubling the city's urban area by extending the urban sprawl from Sebastopol, Delacombe and Alfredton west toward Bonshaw, Smythes Creek and Cardigan with a new suburb to be known as Lucas to be created.

25|$|In 1902, the Hartley College {{became the}} Hartley University College, a degree {{awarding}} {{branch of the}} University of London. This was after inspection of the teaching and finances by the University College Grants Committee, and donations from Council members (including William Darwin the then Treasurer). An increase in student numbers in the following years motivated fund raising efforts to move the college to <b>greenfield</b> <b>land</b> around Back Lane (now University Road) in the Highfield area of Southampton. On 20 June 1914, Viscount Haldane opened the new site of the renamed Southampton University College. However, {{the outbreak of the}} First World War six weeks later meant no lectures could take place there, as the buildings were handed over by the college authorities for use as a military hospital. To cope with the volume of casualties, wooden huts were erected {{at the rear of the}} building. These were donated to university by the War Office after the end of fighting, in time for the transfer from the high street premises in 1920. At this time, Highfield Hall, a former country house and overlooking Southampton Common, for which a lease had earlier been secured, commenced use as a halls of residence for female students. South Hill, on what is now the Glen Eyre Halls Complex was also acquired, along with South Stoneham House to house male students.|$|E

Greenfield Park benefited from its proximity to neighbouring St. Lambert's rail line connected to the newly constructed Victoria Bridge, which was the only major rail link between Montreal and the South Shore. At the time, the bridge was the longest railway bridge in the world. Development had begun to spread into Greenfield Park, which merited the establishment of a town to provide services for the population.|$|R

40|$|The UK has {{experienced}} a long-term upward trend in real house prices. This has created problems of affordability. In addition, the volatility of the housing market has exacerbated problems of macroeconomic instability and had an adverse effect on economic growth. Higher and more responsive levels of housebuilding, leading to a lower trend in real house prices, would benefit the UK in economic terms. But taking account of the environmental costs is also critical in determining the optimal level of housebuilding for the UK. The environmental costs of greater housing supply can be reduced, by increasing densities or through more efficient use of existing land and buildings: however, {{it is clear that}} more <b>greenfield</b> and brownfield <b>land</b> will be needed if an adequate supply of houses is to be delivered.

40|$|Sustainable land {{management}} often requires redevelopment of existing and often contaminated Brownfield sites over use of <b>Greenfield</b> or agricultural <b>land.</b> Stabilisation / solidification (S/S) offer a viable remediation option with particular suitability in treating heavy metal contaminants. However, uncertainties over longterm durability and previously cheap landfill disposal costs resulted in limited use in many countries. There {{is a need}} to characterise treated material and assess components containment and release, to improve S/S confidence and inform remedial design, using the evaluation of the leaching controlling mechanisms. To improve understanding of key features that will enable improvements to such designs, this paper presents an evaluation of leaching for CEM II stabilised kaolin, using the leaching behaviour of 4 main components—aluminium, silicon, calcium and sulphur. Results show no detrimental implications on chemical durability due to kaolin degradation with hydration under induced alkalinity, with increased formation of stable cementitious minerals. Availabilities for components show that aluminium and silicon had minimal leachability compared to total content, whilst calcium and sulphur show almost total leaching availability. Decreasing calcium and silicon leachability under natural chemical conditions with increased hydration duration supports the increased formation of stable cementitious products with time, using the products of kaolin dissociation...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{designers}} {{are not used}} to taking the subsurface into a holistic perspective on spatial development. Nevertheless, the subsurface accommodates numerous functions crucial to urban life, such as infrastructure, carry capacity, heat, water, etc [...] Moreover, it also carries the natural system crucial for urban quality and health. In the light of the current climate change, energy transition and the financial crisis these issues are more important for different reasons. The subsurface stores water, plays a role in cooling the city, provides geothermal warmth as renewable energy, and smart use of the subsurface can save considerable money. Besides, urban renewal (brownfield development) is the preferred option over taking new <b>land</b> (<b>greenfield</b> development). Brownfields do not have an unexplored soil system, it is already used in many ways. Therefore ‘Urban design with the subsurface’ should be considered a new frontier in urban planning and design. The neglect of the subsurface in spatial planning {{is due to the fact}} that responsibilities, tools and knowledge of subsurface engineering and urban planning and design are not integrated, they work on the same locations but divided into sectors. The urban designer is usually dealing with the opportunities for socio-economic benefits whereas the subsoil engineer deals with the technical challenges. Both on a practical level of building the city, as well as at policy level, ‘subsurface’ and ‘surface’ are separate realms. The aim of this report is to discuss this segregation in three countries that are active in integrating subsurface in urban development: Sweden, Netherlands and Flanders (Belgium). The main research questions are: What characterises these planning systems? How is the subsurface framed in these countries? A comparison is performed as the first step in learning and proposing better ways of integrating subsurface in urban planning and design, and vice versa.
