2500|$|According to David A. Morse (1907–199) {{during an}} 1977 interview, in 1949, who had lately been {{general counsel of}} the NLRB and was then U.S. {{delegate}} to the International Labor Conference of the [...] International Labour Organization (ILO), said: [...] At about that time, I think there were all these questions being raised about certain people in the Labor Board; not so much about their qualifications as their political orientation and what Paul Herzog wrote there may have been as a result of that. I remember there was this chap, Nat Witt, who had been head of the unit at the NLRB, that was responsible for the examiners. <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> he had been accused from time to time by outside groups for being much tied in with Lee Pressman {{and the two of them}} were very much tied in with the Communist Party. [...] In 1950, the U.S. State Department revoked singer and civil rights activist Paul Robeson's passport as a means of preventing him from traveling overseas and continuing his left-wing political work. Witt was Robeson's first attorney and initiated Robeson's eight-year battle to regain his passport.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> he also boasted some {{about his}} big brothers, who were away just then.|$|E
6000|$|... "Plantagenet is {{very much}} prettier. I shall always call him Plantagenet. But <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that.</b> You will not {{remember}} that against me?" ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{came over}} Clayton Crest <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> missed the {{multitude}} that now {{night after night}} walked out {{to stare at the}} comet, and the little preacher in the waste beyond the hoardings, who warned sinners to repent before the Judgment, was not in his usual place.|$|R
6000|$|We {{left the}} house which had been our prison, in haste, as if already the pursuers were at our heels, and when we stepped into the open air <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>that</b> which Hiram had said {{regarding}} the lobster back who was to aid us in embarking, therefore whispered to our leader as we went at a swift pace {{in the direction of}} the ship-yard: ...|$|R
60|$|One {{day when}} asking {{my way to}} some {{forgotten}} destination, I had {{pointed out to me}} the Grey and Roberts Deep Mine. Some familiarity in the name set me thinking until <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>that</b> this was the mine in which I had once heard Lady Ladislaw confess large holdings, this mine in which gangs of indentured Chinamen would presently be sweating to pay the wages of the game-keepers and roadmenders in Burnmore Park....|$|R
6000|$|As <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> I have explained, I {{was obliged}} to leave Ragnall Castle {{early the next morning}} to keep a {{shooting}} engagement. O heavens! to keep a shooting engagement! ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was after}} my second sleep, {{subsequent}} to {{the departure of the}} warriors, as <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> I at last went to Ghak with the admission that I could no longer support the intolerable longing to be personally upon the trail of my lost love.|$|E
60|$|Awe-struck, I {{looked at}} the tall young man, {{and he was the}} very essence of wrath. Unmindful of the plaudits, he stood brandishing the fence-rail over the great, writhing figure on the ground. And he was slobbering. <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> this fact gave a twinge to {{something}} in my memory.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>that</b> last {{interview}} with Hautia's messengers, {{so full of}} enigmas; and wondered, whether Yoomy had interpreted aright. Unseen, and unsolicited; still pursuing me with omens, with taunts, and with wooings, mysterious Hautia appalled me. Vaguely I began to fear her. And the thought, that perhaps again and again, her heralds would haunt me, filled me with a nameless dread, which I almost shrank from acknowledging. Inwardly I prayed, that never more they might appear.|$|R
40|$|During the 2005 Conference for the Advancement for Space Safety, after {{a typical}} {{presentation}} of safety tools, a Russian {{in the audience}} simply asked, "How does that affect the hardware?" Having participated in several International System Safety Conferences, <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>that</b> most attention is dedicated to safety tools and little, if any, to hardware. The intent of this paper on the hazard of fracture and failure modes associated with fracture is my attempt {{to draw attention to}} the grass roots of system safety - improving hardware robustness and resilience...|$|R
6000|$|I {{grinned at}} her from the {{doorstep}} while Mrs. Meldrum's maid stood there to admit me. [...] "Oh I'm so glad," [...] I said, looking at her as she paced away with the pretty flutter she had kept and remembering the day when, while she rejoined Lord Iffield, I had indulged in the same observation. Her air of assurance was on this occasion not less than it had been on that; but <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>that</b> she had then struck me as marching off to her doom. Was she really now marching away from it? ...|$|R
60|$|I always {{smile when}} <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> young fellow; and yet, if the reader were to smile also, I should feel ashamed. If my son shall be only like {{him when he}} comes to that age, it will be a brave day for me and not a bad one for his country.|$|E
6000|$|I-Gos laughed. [...] "Terror turned {{your heart}} to water," [...] he replied; [...] "and shame your tongue to libel. This be no Corphal, but only a woman of Helium; her {{companion}} a warrior who can match blades {{with the best of}} you and cut your putrid hearts. Not so in the days of I-Gos' youth. Ah, then were there men in Manator. Well do <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> day that I--" ...|$|E
60|$|The lack of room in {{our house}} is brought painfully to my mind as <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> she lay {{for a week or}} two in a corner of our living room with all the noise and bustle of the family going on around her. Her own attic chamber was unwarmed (like those of all her girl friends), and so she was forced to lie near the kitchen stove.|$|E
60|$|For {{some days}} really I {{think that my}} reason hung just upon the edge of that mental precipice. In the end, however, {{reflection}} and education, of which I had a certain amount, thanks to my father, came to my aid. <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>that</b> such massacres, often on an infinitely larger scale, had happened a thousand times in history, and that still through them, often, indeed, by means of them, civilisation has marched forward, and mercy and peace have kissed {{each other over the}} bloody graves of the victims.|$|R
60|$|Henry Salt Hinchcliffe stalked back to {{the cart}} and spoke to his cousin. <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> much <b>that</b> the wind bore to me of his words and the carrier's. It {{seemed as if the}} {{friendship}} of years were dissolving amid throes.|$|R
40|$|I arrived early at Melriches Café after {{spending}} the morning at the University, so I was able to grab a good table {{with a view of}} the street. The week before, Gary Genosko had e-mailed me to arrange for us to meet up on his way home to Thunder Bay from Victoria. As I sipped my latte, <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>that</b> this would be the first time we’d seen each other since February 2000 when he invited me to give a talk to his department at Lakehead (‘Weber’s Tolstoyan Arts’, I called it), and before that we were together i...|$|R
60|$|Now, <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> when I {{was a boy}} I was a good boy--I was a {{very good}} boy. Why, I was the best boy in my school. I was the best boy in that little Mississippi town where I lived. The {{population}} was only about twenty million. You may not believe it, but I was the best boy in that State--and in the United States, for that matter.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> {{when this}} sample {{came to me}} by express, I had my first and only {{conviction}} that my financial worries were over. Even Zulime was impressed with my brother's smelter reports which gave the proportion of gold to the ton, precisely set down in bold black figures. All {{we had to do}} was to ship a sufficient number of car lots for the year and our income would rival that of Carnegie's.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Help me {{to clear}} myself with Mr. Crisparkle, Helena. Help me to {{convince}} him that I cannot be the first to make concessions without mockery and falsehood. My nature must be changed before I can do so, and it is not changed. I am sensible of inexpressible affront, and deliberate aggravation of inexpressible affront, and I am angry. The plain truth is, I am still as angry when <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> night as I was that night.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before {{she left}} the house with you, the next day, for this?"--he was entirely reminiscent. [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> is <b>that</b> even if I had condoned--that evening--her {{deception}} of me in my folly, I still loathed, for my friend's sake, her practical joke on poor John." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{location}} is coincidentally {{across from the}} oldest remaining Bob's Big Boy restaurant. Albert Kallis was a professional artist who designed the film posters of American International Pictures in the 1950s. Director Bert <b>I.</b> Gordon <b>recalled</b> <b>that</b> Kallis designed their logo and left poster artwork.|$|R
5000|$|... "I...you know I can't really {{remember}} right now, <b>I</b> can't really <b>recall</b> <b>that,</b> but that's beside the point. | You wanna do it?" ...|$|R
60|$|The dying Quick {{opened his}} eyes, lifted his hand, upon {{which there was}} a ghastly sword-cut, to his forehead, as though to shade them from the light--ah! how well <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> pathetic motion--and from beneath this screen stared at us a while. Then he rose from the chair, touched his throat {{to show that he}} could not speak, as I suppose, saluted Orme, turned and pointed to Maqueda, and with a triumphant smile sank down and--died.|$|E
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> clean-shaven man {{who talked}} {{with us for}} a little while in the public office at Wassen, the man who reminded me of my boyish conception of a Knight Templar, and with him come momentary impressions of other lithe and serious-looking people dressed after the same manner, words and phrases we have read in such scraps of Utopian reading as have come our way, and expressions that fell from the loose mouth of the man with the blond hair....|$|E
6000|$|Presently I {{began to}} write again. It was not an ode, but a prayer, oddly profane--and it was in Italian, in the [...] "dialettale" [...] that {{provoked}} Fifanti's sneers. How it ran I have forgotten these many years. But <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> in it I likened myself to a sailor navigating shoals and besought the pharos of Giuliana's eyes to bring me safely through, besought her to anoint me with her glance and so hearten me to brave the dangers of that procellous sea.|$|E
60|$|I {{was very}} much {{impressed}} by the elaborate secrecy of these two men regarding {{the contents of the}} place, and for some time I was thinking of that and of the unaccountable familiarity of the name of Moreau; but so odd is the human memory that I could not then <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> well-known name in its proper connection. From that my thoughts went to the indefinable queerness of the deformed man on the beach. I never saw such a gait, such odd motions as he pulled at the box. <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>that</b> none of these men had spoken to me, though most of them I had found looking at me {{at one time or another}} in a peculiarly furtive manner, quite unlike the frank stare of your unsophisticated savage. Indeed, they had all seemed remarkably taciturn, and when they did speak, endowed with very uncanny voices. What was wrong with them? Then <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> the eyes of Montgomery's ungainly attendant.|$|R
60|$|The fog was as dense as ever--we {{moved in}} the very womb of night--but <b>I</b> cannot <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> took the faintest note {{of it as the}} dinghy, guided by the tow-rope, {{disappeared}} toward the Agatha, Pyecroft rowing. The bell began again on the starboard bow.|$|R
60|$|It was borne in upon me {{that some}} great personage was {{arriving}} in Toulouse, {{and my first}} thought was of the King. At the idea of such a possibility my brain whirled and I grew dizzy with hope. The next moment <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>that</b> but last night Roxalanne had {{told me that he was}} no nearer than Lyons, and so I put the thought from me, and the hope with it, for, travelling in that leisurely, indolent fashion that was characteristic of his every action, it would be a miracle if His Majesty should reach Toulouse before the week was out, and this but Sunday.|$|R
60|$|The apples ripened, {{and were}} shaken {{to the ground}} by the winds. The good Father Gibault, true to his promise, strove to teach me French. Indeed, I picked up much of that {{language}} in my intercourse with the inhabitants of Kaskaskia. How well <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> simple life,--its dances, its songs, and the games with the laughing boys and girls on the common! And the good people were very kind to the orphan that dwelt with Colonel Clark, the drummer boy of his regiment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whom did you promise?" [...] {{she asked}} with a flash of rage. [...] "Was it a woman? Nay, I see, it is a man's ring, and that is well, for {{otherwise}} I would bring a curse on her, however far off she may be dwelling. Say no more and forgive my anger. A vow is a vow--keep your ring. But where is that one you used to wear in bygone days? <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> it had a cross upon it, not this star and figure of an eagle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a cloud," [...] he said, [...] "a {{dark cloud}} upon {{the work of}} the Gospel among the poor Indians. The Lord renew and prosper that work, and grant it may live when I am dead. It is a work which I have been doing much and long about. But what was the word I spoke last? <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> word. My doings. Alas! they have been poor and small, and lean doings, and I'll be the man that shall throw the first stone at them all." ...|$|E
3000|$|<b>I</b> cannot resist <b>recalling</b> <b>that</b> Smale {{referred}} to it as a “wild idea” and wrote “I must admit a positive answer would be a little shocking!” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{whenever}} those {{notes in}} the street begin, [...] <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> her, and <b>that</b> far scene, And her acting of how the Allies marched in, [...] And her touse of the tambourine!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I don't recall {{whether it}} was a three-day stop or not," [...] Stevens told CBC when {{questioned}} about the trip. [...] "But <b>I</b> do <b>recall</b> <b>that</b> we did it in that fashion because it was less expensive than flying business class. In other words, it was the most economic way of doing it." ...|$|R
