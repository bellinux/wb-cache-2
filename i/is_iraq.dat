5000|$|This {{battle is}} termed [...] "Armageddon" [...] in Revelation 16:16, a term which occurs {{only once in}} the Bible. It derives from the Hebrew for [...] "Mountain of Megiddo", and occurs only in Revelation 16:16 in the Bible. Modern Adventist {{scholarship}} believes it refers not to a physical battle in the Middle East, but {{is a metaphor for}} a spiritual battle. There is no mountain called [...] "Megiddo", but the city Megiddo, now ruined, lies in the Jezreel Valley, at the foot of Mount Carmel which was the site of Elijah's conflict with the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18). Based in this imagery, Armageddon is understood as a worldwide 'spiritual' battle - a battle for the mind. Paulien believes it is not literal fire, and not literally on Carmel, but likely false prophets and false Christs performing miracles in the world (Matthew 24:24). The Euphrates river is equated with the [...] "many waters" [...] the prostitutes sits on, which the Bible identifies as peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages. Thus the drying of the river is the removal of the political powers supporting Babylon. (Earlier, Uriah Smith viewed the drying of the Euphrates river (Revelation 16:12) as the shrinking of Turkey, the nation occupying most of the river; however today this <b>is</b> <b>Iraq.</b> He saw Armageddon as a literal battle at Megiddo in Israel due to its strategic military location, and the three unclean spirits as spiritism.) ...|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} years of the war, the United States lacked {{meaningful}} relations with either Iran or Iraq, the former due to the Iranian Revolution and the Iran hostage crisis and the latter because of Iraq's alliance with the Soviet Union and hostility towards Israel. Following Iran's success of repelling the Iraqi invasion and Khomeini's refusal to end the war in 1982, the US made an outreach to Iraq, beginning with the restoration of diplomatic relations in 1984. The United States wished to both keep Iran away from Soviet influence and protect other Gulf states from any threat of Iranian expansion. As a result, it began to provide limited support to Iraq. In 1982, Henry Kissinger, former Secretary of State, outlined US policy towards Iran:The focus of Iranian pressure at this moment <b>is</b> <b>Iraq.</b> There are few governments in the world less deserving of our support and less capable of using it. Had Iraq won the war, the fear in the Gulf and the threat to our interest would be scarcely less than it is today. Still, given the importance of the balance of power in the area, it is in our interests to promote a ceasefire in that conflict; through not a cost that will preclude an eventual rapprochement with Iran either if a more moderate regime replaces Khomenini's or if the present rulers wake up to geopolitical reality that the historic threat to Iran's independence has always come from the country with which it shares a border of 1500 mi: the Soviet Union. A rapprochement with Iran, of course, must await at a minimum Iran's abandonment of hegemonic aspirations in the Gulf. Richard Murphy, Assistant Secretary of State during the war, testified to Congress in 1984 that the Reagan administration believed a victory for either Iran or Iraq was [...] "neither militarily feasible nor strategically desirable." ...|$|E

Should Sri Lanka, with its long-standing civil war between Sinhalas and Tamils, recreate itself as a federal state? We require a general principle of institutional design in ethnically divided democracies to answer these questions. This principle should tell us (a) what the goal of institutional design in ethnically divided democracies should be, (b) the mechanism by which this goal might be achieved, and (c) the institutions which best activate this mechanism. The extensive previous literature on this subject implicitly proposes one of five principles: the principle of ethnic banning, the principle of ethnic interdependence, the principle of ethnic matching, the principle of ethnic over-representation and the principle of ethnic self-government...|$|E
