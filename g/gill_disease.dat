50|$|Xenomas are {{provoked}} {{in various}} types of organisms, depending on the species of the parasite. Microsporidia are known to produce xenomas in oligochaetes, insects, crustaceans and fish. In addition to organism specificity, different species of parasite will have distinct host cell specificity, even if targeting the same organism. For example, Microsporidium chaetogastris infects solely connective and muscle tissue cells of the annelid Chaetogaster diaphanus, whereas other species of microsporidia will target other tissue types. Another example is microsporidial <b>gill</b> <b>disease</b> in different species of fish caused by Loma salmonae. It was found that certain species had a higher prevalence of xenoma formation following infection with the same parasite i.e. xenomas per gill filament in chinook salmon was 8 to 33 times greater than in rainbow trout, showing differences in host cell susceptibility. Once a host cell is infected with the microsporidian (or protist) parasite, a complete restructuring of the host cell ensues. This occurs as the parasite seeks {{to take control of}} the metabolism of the cell, in order to survive and exploit the host cell's resources and reproduction. It provides the parasite with optimal growth conditions and protection from the host's immune response. The parasite proliferates within the host cell where its mass replaces most of the host cell's cytoplasm, with the rest being taken up by microvillus structures and rhizoids. Other structures may be present inside the infected host cell including vesicles, fat globules and bundles of fibril. The nucleus may be in varying locations including the centre of the cell and may also vary in structure i.e. lobed, branched or divided into multiple fragments, but it will always be hypertrophic. The host also commonly envelops the proliferating parasite and the host cell itself in layers of membranes and cells.|$|E

Monogenean parasite was suspected as the main cause of high mortality of hybrid grouper in the fish farm. The present study aimed to determine causative agent of gill fluke infection in hybrid grouper at the fish farm and the effective treatment with formalin. Firstly, the gills of the unhealthy fish was cut out and observed under the microscope. The parasite was identified from characteristics of body shape and internal organs using the digital photographic microscope. 7 out of 28 fish were infected with Pseudorhabdosynochus sp. while other does not found any parasite attach on the gill. For the effect of treatment (in vitro) experiment, gill filaments with monogenean were transferred and immersed in various concentrations of formalin in the petri dish. High concentration more than 300 ppm formalin was effective to gill fluke within 30 minutes. 1000 ppm formalin was the most effective because all the parasites were immobilized within 10 minutes. For the acute toxicity of formalin, a total 35 healthy hybrid grouper were used in this experiment and put into 7 containers with different concentrations of formalin. The fish were exposed into each formalin for 1 hour. Formalin up to 500 ppm was not toxic to the fish.

40|$|Fish gills {{function}} as both respiratory and excretory organs. Basically they {{consist of a}} network of capillaries where blood is separated from the surrounding water by only one or two layers of cells. Proliferation of epithelial tissue, and later the loss of surface by the clubbing and fusing of lamellae, impair respiration and the excretion of nitrogenous waste materials, and disturb osmotic balance. Because these changes adversely affect the health of fish, the prevention and treatment of gill diseases are important in fish culture. Pathologic changes in gill tissues have been divided into five categories: (1) bacterial <b>gill</b> <b>disease</b> (BGD) of salmonids and pondfishes, caused by filamentous bacteria that have yellow pigment in their cell walls; (2) nutritional <b>gill</b> <b>disease,</b> caused by a deficiency of pantothenic acid; (3) hemorrhagic <b>gill</b> <b>disease,</b> in which an apparent hemorrhagic condition is really a dilation of lamellar vessels (telangiectasia), caused by toxic agents or physical injury; (4) mycotic gill necrosis in pondfishes, caused by the fungus Branchiomyces (Meyer and Robinson 1973; Niesh and Hughes 1980); and (5) proliferative <b>gill</b> <b>disease</b> of unknown etiology in pondfishes and rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Daoust and Ferguson 1985).

They accounted for 18 % of all diagnostic submissions to the Atlantic Veterinary College from commercial fish hatcheries. Definitive diagnosis is difficult because of the growth characteristics of the putative bacteria in culture. Research into the pathogenesis of these diseases has also been similarly limited. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were developed to 2 globally significant gill bacterial pathogens, Flavobacterium branchiophilum, the causative agent of bacterial <b>gill</b> <b>disease,</b> and Cytophaga columnaris, the causative agent of columnaris disease of salmonids.

40|$|<b>Gill</b> <b>disease</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} challenges facing global salmon aquaculture and in terms of economic impact; amoebic <b>gill</b> <b>disease</b> (AGD) caused by the free living protozoan Neoparamoeba perurans is perhaps the most destructive. However, <b>gill</b> <b>disease</b> is often multifactorial, with numerous putative pathogens identified as potentially playing a role. AGD was first described in Irish aquaculture in 1995. Between the years 1995 and 2010, there were sporadic and relatively minor outbreaks of AGD. Since the re-emergence of the disease in 2011 / 2012, greater focus has been placed on gill health. This research aimed to investigate <b>gill</b> <b>disease</b> and in particular the re-emergence of AGD caused by N. perurans in Irish aquaculture. Through this it was hoped to provide the industry with the tools and information to help improve management of <b>gill</b> <b>disease</b> as well as fish health and welfare. With respect to this, Chapter 2 of this thesis details the effort to develop and validate a real-time TaqMan® PCR assay to detect Neoparamoeba perurans in Atlantic salmon gills. Furthermore, it describes the use of this assay to monitor disease progression on a marine Atlantic salmon farm in Ireland in conjunction with gross gill pathology and histopathology. As molecular diagnosis of AGD remains a high priority for much of the international salmon farming industry, Chapter 3 evaluates the suitability of currently available molecular assays in conjunction with the most appropriate non-destructive sampling methodology. In addition it compares this methodology with traditional screening methods of gill scoring and histopathology. Chapter 4 addresses the complex and multifactorial nature of gill disorders. Co-infections are common on farms and there is a lack of knowledge in relation to interactions and synergistic effects of these agents. The advances in molecular diagnostics have made it possible in Chapter 5 to identify N. perurans as the causative agent in the earliest AGD outbreaks. In addition to this, a number of other putative pathogens were also identified in these early cases of <b>gill</b> <b>disease.</b> Finally, Chapter 6 concludes the findings of this research and how they relate to the current knowledge of gill health and welfare.
