5|$|Elsewhere, about 150 men {{landed at}} Cape Murro di Porco and {{captured}} a radio station. Based on a warning of imminent glider landings transmitted by the station's previous occupants, the local Italian commander ordered a counter-attack but his troops failed to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>message.</b> The scattered {{nature of the}} landings now worked in the brigade's favour as {{they were able to}} cut all telephone wires in the immediate area. Forces at the bridge came under repeated attacks from the Italians while the expected 5th Infantry Division relief did not appear at 10:00 as planned. By 15:30 only 15 of men at the bridge remained fit to fight and they were out of ammunition, as a result the Italians then recaptured the bridge. The first unit from the 5th Division, the 2nd Northamptonshire Regiment of the 17th Brigade, arrived at the bridge at 16:15 and mounted a successful counterattack. The prior removal of demolition charges from the bridge had prevented the Italians from destroying it. The brigade then took no further part in the fighting and was withdrawn back to North Africa on 13 July. During the landings in Sicily, the losses by the 1st Airlanding Brigade were the worst of all the British units involved so far. They amounted to 313 killed and 174 missing or wounded. The accompanying glider pilots lost 14 killed, and a further 87 were missing or wounded.|$|E

500|$|Following El Alamein, the 9th Armoured Brigade was {{withdrawn}} first to Cairo {{and then to}} Syria for internal security duties, where it remained throughout 1942 and 1943. In May 1944, it reached the Italian Front and was placed {{under the command of}} Major-General Charles F. Keightley's 78th [...] "Battleaxe" [...] Division, then under Lieutenant-General Sidney C. Kirkman's XIII Corps. The RWY was to support the 36th Infantry Brigade, with one squadron in support of each of the brigade's three infantry battalions. In May–June 1944, it took part in the advance on Rome, working its way up in close country between the central mountains and the sea to the west.

500|$|Reaction to {{the release}} was [...] "generally ecstatic", {{according}} to MacDonald, with listeners marvelling at the album's [...] "aural invention". To the Beatles' less progressive fans, however, the radical changes in the band's sound were the source of confusion. The editor of the Australian teen magazine Mirabelle wrote: [...] "Everyone, from Brisbane to Bootle, hates that daft song Lennon sang {{at the end of}} Revolver." [...] In his review for the NME, Allen Evans said, in response to the lyric's exhortation to [...] "relax and float downstream": [...] "But how can you relax with the electronic, outer-space noises, often sounding like seagulls? … Only Ringo's rock-steady drumming is natural." [...] Peter Jones of Record Mirror commented: [...] "You need some sort of aural microscope to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> from this. But it's darned compelling listening." [...] Writing in 1977, author Nicholas Schaffner said that those who had been confused by the lyrics were most likely unfamiliar with hallucinogenic drugs and Timothy Leary's message, but that the transcendental quality became clear during the build-up to the 1967 Summer of Love.|$|E

500|$|Milne {{was with}} Dundee United {{for a further}} three seasons and still a regular player in the team, {{although}} he scored less frequently. Milne's increasingly fractious relationship with manager Jim McLean was also becoming common knowledge; in December 1983 McLean publicly criticised Milne, stating [...] "I have tried to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> across to him that it is {{when he is not}} playing well that he needs to work hardest. It is plainly not sinking in." [...] Ironically some months later in August 1984, it was Milne who scored both goals against Nottingham Forest in a pre-season testimonial match for McLean. However, after the game the pair again fell out because of a brief conversation Milne had with Brian Clough which led McLean to believe the player was trying to arrange a deal away from United; by this time Milne had grown increasingly frustrated over being frequently fined a week's wages for breaking minor club rules and generally offending McLean's strict sense of discipline. The financial strain this caused led to him to work as a casual labourer in order to meet his mortgage repayments. By this time his drinking had become more of a problem, resulting in a struggle to maintain fitness.|$|E

Watts' books of the '60s reveal the influence of these chemical adventures on his outlook. He later said about psychedelic drug use, [...] "If you <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>message,</b> hang up the phone.

[...] The tankard that Pete was often seen drinking from in pub scenes was allegedly so popular that Peter Dean reported it was stolen twice by fans and he had to replace it on both occasions. Dean has suggested that during his time in the soap, the most letters he received were about a storyline that saw him cross-dressing as part of a practical joke: [...] "The episode I got the most letters about was when Pete was going to a Topsy Turvy party, where men dress as women and women as men.

On 4 December the Council was asked to support this application by unnamed promoters to the Board of Trade for a Provisional Order to extend tramways but they refused. The tramways were the subject of debate at the next meeting on 8 January 1883 and it was resolved that the Corporation should purchase on equitable terms the tramway lines of the Nottingham and District Tramways Company Limited and should make all further extensions themselves, and lease the lines to a Company.
