5|$|The Spanish {{entered the}} American Revolutionary War in 1779. The British {{military}} planners in London wanted {{to secure the}} corridor of the Mississippi River against both Spanish and Patriot activity. Their plans included expeditions from West Florida to take New Orleans and other Spanish targets, including several expeditions to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> targets in the Upper Mississippi, such as {{the small town of}} St. Louis. The expedition from West Florida never got off the ground because Bernardo de Gálvez, the Governor of Spanish Louisiana, moved rapidly to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> British outposts on the Lower Mississippi and threatened action against West Florida's principal outposts of Mobile and Pensacola.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 11th century, the Norman lord, Robert Fitzhamon entered Morgannwg {{in an attempt}} to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the area, {{building}} many earth and timber castles in the lowlands. In the early 12th century the Norman expansion continued with castles being founded around Neath, Kenfig and Coity, while within the same period Bishop Urban established the Diocese of Llandaff under which Glynrhondda belonged to the large parish of Llantrisant.|$|E
5|$|Hays {{made the}} {{construction}} of the mainline his priority, failing to develop feeder lines. CNoR and CPR joined forces to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the prairie traffic. The competition among the three railroads led to Canada's ending up with three transcontinental railways instead of one. This was to result in the GTP's being starved of traffic; even though it was arguably the best of the three, it ultimately failed to attract enough freight to make it profitable.|$|E

5|$|In 392 BC, a {{civil war}} had taken place at Corinth, in which a group of pro-Spartan oligarchs was {{defeated}} and exiled by anti-Spartan democrats. Those exiles cooperated with Spartan forces {{in the region to}} <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Corinth's port on the Corinthian Gulf, Lechaeum. They then repulsed several attacks on the port by the democrats at Corinth and their Theban and Argive allies and secured their hold over the port.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania became {{increasingly}} interested in extending its territorial rule to Livonia, especially to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Baltic seaports, such as Riga, {{and for other}} economic benefits. Livonia was by the 1550s largely Lutheran, traditionally ruled by the Brothers of the Sword knightly order. This put Poland and Lithuania {{on a collision course}} with Moscow and other regional powers, which had also attempted expansion in that area.|$|E
5|$|On the {{opposite}} bank of the Mississippi, a second simultaneous attack on the nearby former British colonial outpost of Cahokia, occupied by Patriot Virginians, was also repulsed. The retreating Indians destroyed the crops and took captive civilians outside the protected area. The British failed to defend {{their side of the}} river and, thus, effectively ended any attempts to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the Mississippi River during the war.|$|E

5|$|The final {{steps in}} the shift to empire may have been {{triggered}} by Athens' defeat in Egypt, which challenged the city's dominance in the Aegean {{and led to the}} revolt of several allies, such as Miletus and Erythrae. Either because of a genuine fear for its safety after the defeat in Egypt and the revolts of the allies, or as a pretext to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the League's finances, Athens transferred the treasury of the alliance from Delos to Athens in 454–453BC.|$|E

5|$|After a few days, {{the main}} {{thrust of the}} {{offensive}} was halted south of Rimini by strong resistance and severe weather, and the British and Indian flanking forces began to push westwards, taking the frontline towards San Marino.
