40|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{investigating the}} use of metaphor in expressing <b>imagined</b> <b>emotions</b> was administered to 136 undergraduate students. Five categories of metaphor function were identified in this research - Transmission, Image, Play, Specification, and Indirectness. In compiling {{the results of this}} study I have created a scale to show the metaphor function and its relationship to the expression of emotions, in particular sadness and happiness, before and after {{the use of}} metaphor. T-tests were used to compare two groups, the strength of emotion before metaphor is expressed, and the effect of metaphor on <b>imagined</b> <b>emotions.</b> It was found that as for sadness Image and as for happiness Transmission do not work for the strong emotion than the weak emotion. Furthermore, in regard to the effect of metaphor on <b>imagined</b> <b>emotions,</b> the results showed that Image and Transmission strengthen sad emotions, and Image and Specification strengthen happy emotions. In conclusion, this study showed that different emotions are affected in different ways with different metaphor functions...|$|R

40|$|High-frequency {{cortical}} potentials in electroencephalographic (EEG) scalp recordings {{have low}} amplitudes {{and may be}} confounded with scalp muscle activities. EEG data from an eyes-closed emotion imagination task were linearly decomposed using independent component analysis (ICA) into maximally independent component (IC) processes. Joint decomposition of IC log spectrograms into source- and frequency-independent modulator (IM) processes revealed three distinct classes of IMs that separately modulated broadband high-frequency (~ 15 - 200 Hz) power of brain, scalp muscle, and likely ocular motor IC processes. Multi-dimensional scaling revealed significant but spatially complex relationships between mean broadband brain IM effects and the valence of the <b>imagined</b> <b>emotions.</b> Thus, contrary to prevalent assumption, unitary modes of spectral modulation of frequencies encompassing the beta, gamma, and high gamma frequency ranges can be isolated from scalp-recorded EEG data and may be differentially associated with brain sources and cognitive activities...|$|R
40|$|I give {{grounds for}} taking seriously the {{possibility}} that some of the emotions we ascribe do not exist. I build on the premise that the experience of <b>imagining</b> an <b>emotion</b> resembles that of having one. First a person <b>imagines</b> having an <b>emotion.</b> This is much like an emotion, so the person takes herself to be having the <b>emotion</b> that she <b>imagines,</b> and acts or expects a disposition to act accordingly. The view sketched here contrasts possibly impossible emotions such as disembodied passion, blind rage, and Quixotic courage with real ones such as affection, anger, and bravery. Both these real emotions and the states of imagining impossible ones are things that really happen to us...|$|R

During the adaptation phase participants (1) looked for a prolonged amount of time at a facial expression (visual adaptation); (2) executed repeatedly a facial expression (motor adaptation); (3) <b>imagined</b> the <b>emotion</b> corresponding to a facial expression (imagine adaptor). In the test phase participants always had to judge an ambiguous facial expression as either happy or fearful.

Participants were required to complete the Japanese version of emotional skills and competence questionnaire (Toyota, Morita & Taksic, 2007) to assess the level of emotional intelligence. Then they were asked to rate pleasantness of the episodes in the past or those in the future that each target reminded it of followed by unexpected free recall tests. For the targets with the episodes in the past, participants with high emotional intelligence and low emotional intelligence recalled targets with pleasant and unpleasant episodes more than those with neutral ones. Whereas for the targets with the episodes in the future, participants with high emotional intelligence recalled the targets with pleasant and unpleasant episodes more than those with neutral ones, but participants with low emotional intelligence recalled targets equally across the pleasant, neutral and unpleasant episodes. These results were interpreted as showing that participants with low level of emotional intelligence had a difficulty of processing emotional attributes in the episodes in the future, because they could not <b>imagine</b> the <b>emotion</b> that would be included in the episodes in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this study is a notion of empathy that is common in {{philosophy}} and in the behavioral sciences. It is here referred to as ‘the notion of empathy as emotional sharing’, and it is characterized in terms of three ideas. If a person, S, has empathy with respect to an emotion of another person, O, then (i) S experiences an emotion that is similar to an emotion that O is currently having, (ii) S’s emotion is caused, in a particular way, by the state of O or by S’s entertaining an idea of the state or situation of O, and (iii) S experiences this emotion {{in a way that does}} not entail that S is in the corresponding emotional state. The aim of the study is to clarify this notion of empathy by clarifying these three ideas and by tracing the history of their development in philosophy. The study consists of two parts. Part one contains a short and selective account of the history in Western philosophy of the notion of empathy as emotional sharing. In chapter 2 Spinoza’s theory of imitation of affects and Hume’s theory of sympathy are presented. It is argued that these theories only exemplify the second idea characteristic of the notion of empathy as emotional sharing. Chapter 3 contains presentations of Adam Smith’s theory of sympathy, and Schopenhauer’s theory of compassion. These theories are shown to exemplify the second and the third idea. In chapter 4 there are presentations of Edith Stein’s description of Einfühlung, and Max Scheler’s account of empathy and fellow-feeling. It is shown that these accounts contain explicit specifications of the third idea, and it is argued that they also exemplify the second idea. In part two, the three ideas are further clarified and the notion of empathy as emotional sharing is defined. Chapter 5 contains a discussion of the main contemporary philosophical analyses of empathy. Three different views are distinguished: one that construes empathetic emotions as emotional states, one that construes them as <b>imagined</b> <b>emotions,</b> and one that construes them as off-line emotions. The first two views are criticized and rejected. The third is accepted and further developed in chapter 6, which contains a general analysis of the emotions. A distinction is made between two ways of experiencing an emotion, and it is argued that it is possible to have the affective experience characteristic of a particular kind of emotional state without being in that kind of state. In chapter 7, a definition of ‘empathy’ is proposed. This definition contains specifications of the three ideas characteristic of the notion of empathy as emotional sharing, and it shows both how the empathizer’s emotion resembles the emotion of the empathee, and how this emotion is caused and experienced...|$|R

They were social animals willing, even eager, to join forces with another animal to merge their sense of group with the others' sense and create an expanded super-group that was beneficial to both in multiple ways.

5000|$|According to the hypothesis, two {{distinct}} pathways reactivate somatic marker responses. In the first pathway, emotion can be evoked {{by changes in}} the body that are projected to the brain - called the [...] "body loop". For instance, encountering a feared object like a snake may initiate the fight-or-flight response and cause fear. In the second pathway, cognitive representations of the <b>emotions</b> (<b>imagining</b> an unpleasant situation [...] "as-if" [...] you were in that particular situation) can be activated in the brain without being directly elicited by a sensory stimulus - called the [...] "as-if body loop". Thus, the brain can anticipate expected bodily changes, which allows the individual to respond faster to external stimuli {{without waiting for an}} event to actually occur. The amygdala and VMPFC (a subsection of the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex or OMPFC) are essential components of this hypothesized mechanism, and therefore damage to either structure will disrupt decision-making.|$|R

Results demonstrated that the intensity of mixed emotions is generally underestimated at the time of recall—an effect that increases over time and does not occur to the same degree with unipolar emotions. Of note, the decline in memory of mixed emotions is distinct from the pattern found for memory of negative emotions, implying that the recall bias is diagnostic of the complexity of mixed emotions rather than of any association with negative affect. Finally, the memory decay effect was driven by the felt conflict aroused by the experience of mixed <b>emotions.</b> <b>Imagine</b> you are at Disneyland about to board the SpaceMountain ride.

40|$|Our {{motor and}} {{somatosensory}} cortices originally evolved to control our movement through the environment. In the past decade, {{one of the}} most exciting developments in cognitive neuroscience is the discovery that the same sensorimotor brain regions that are used to control our body are involved in the perception of others’ actions, sensations and emotions. Human beings are equipped with a mechanism mapping perceptual representations of actions, sensations, and emotions onto sensorimotor representations, thus, perception of others might be inherently grounded in the same brain regions involved in first-hand subjective experiences. While the notion that observing, or <b>imagining</b> actions, <b>emotions,</b> and sensations in others triggers vicarious activations in the sensorimotor network is widely accepted, evidence about the specific role of these activations in social cognition is meagre and still largely based on correlational data. The experiments included in the present thesis aim at exploring the functional role of the sensorimotor network in understanding others’ internal emotional and cognitive states. We used neuromodulation tools to interfere with brain activity in regions involved in moving and sensing the body while participants were asked to understand others’ emotions or intentions. In experiment 1 to 7 we focused on the ability to accurately understand amusement from observed smiles, while in experiment 8 to 10 we explored the ability to rate the pain felt by another individual when her/his experience is described only through text. Our results show that interference with activity within somatosensory and motor cortices impairs participants’ ability to understand others’ emotions. Combining complex naturalistic tasks to neuromodulation tools, the present thesis sheds novel light on the behavioural relevance of vicarious activations in the sensorimotor network, by establishing a strong and direct causal link between sensorimotor brain networks and others’ understanding that was only suggested in the past...|$|R

40|$|BLACK, WHITE, BROWN Aisha Shani Harrison, M. F. A University of Nebraska, 2010 Adviser: Gail Kendall I address {{emotions}} and perceptions that {{are complex and}} multifaceted. My goal is for the work to communicate these emotions {{in a way that}} makes them accessible to others. Most people have felt disconnected, longing, anticipation, relief, anger, frustration and have experienced internal conflict. While this work touches on these emotions, there is, because of who I am, a set of questions I am asking regarding racial identity. This autobiographical work is a series of ceramic figures that are engaged with symbolic objects which together form allegorical narratives. The scenarios address how I see myself and feelings I experience when interacting with others. The figures are fairly realistic female figures based on my body. With this gesture that encompasses openness and vulnerability, I intend to bring out the individual humanity in the figures rather than create a generalized human form. The figures are various shades of brown that reflect brown skin tones. I address skin color because it is an integral part of my body and identity. I have been taught in school to try to be colorblind but have realized that the idea of colorblindness glosses over rich cultural heritages, the effects of history and it denies the existence of racism in society today. The figures are smaller than life sized and unclothed. Clothing would add an unnecessary layer of information. Their nakedness, sizes and postures make them vulnerable. This underscores the vulnerability that I allude to by using my body, emotions, and experiences to make this work. The figures however, reveal no self-consciousness about this vulnerability. Instead, they are empowered, actively interacting with their circumstances. In Connect, for example, the naked figure is bent at the waist and has her rear towards the viewer. The center of the figure’s forehead connects to the large abstracted hair that extends up the wall. The viewer is given only the profile of her face, letting them <b>imagine</b> the <b>emotion</b> of the figure based on other cues and their own interpretation. As a member of many non-dominant groups, I am constantly made aware of the dynamics of power that surround me. I investigate this hierarchy in my work by shifting the interplay of power between the figure and its circumstances, the figure and the viewer, and the viewer and the circumstances. I achieve this through scale, nakedness, areas of focus of the figures, and realism. In Served, for example, I examine the power dynamics between the two figures as well as the role of the viewer in the situation. One figure is naked and the size of a child but has the body of a full-grown woman. She is focused on getting the other half of her hair from a white square plate on the table. The other figure, less rendered and clothed, is holding up the table as a table leg. The white table and the plate are standard dining-room sized, indicating that the scale of the piece is the same as the scale of the viewer. These factors can lead to questions such as, “who is the Server and what is being served?” The symbols I use, like white, black and hair, are common. The symbolism of hair is based on its physical consistency and style. It signals social status, identity, ethnicity, desire, beauty, sanity, and gender among many other things. The colors black and white are used to describe oppositional sides, night and day, good and evil. They are also used to describe skin color. My goal is to illuminate and problematize this black and white dichotomy. In the piece Black, White, Brown, large black and white panels flank the hollow, brown, vertically split figure that is facing itself. The placement of the figure in relation to the panels indicates that the panels play a supportive role for each half of the figure. While the panels appear to be black and white from a distance, up close, there is visual depth achieved by the layering of black and white paint over colorful imagery. From one direction the panels are all black, and from the other, all white. From the center, white and black face each other. I am drawn to clay as my primary material for making the figures because in its wet state, it moves and responds like human flesh. Once it is fired is contains the warmth and variety of skin as well as the record of touch. Because the figures are hollow, I think about them as the shell of a person. In the act of hollowing, I am physically scooping out the insides of the figures and then presenting those insides ({{emotions and}} thoughts) as symbolic circumstances outside the figure. In this way, I feel that the materials and content have merged...|$|R

El objetivo general de la tesis consiste en conocer las analogías existentes en el modo en que el arquitecto y el cineasta afrontan el proceso de creación de sus proyectos desde la acción gráfica. Si consideramos el medio gráfico como un recurso creativo en el proyecto arquitectónico y cinematográfico, el boceto, croquis o “storyboard” se convierten en documentos fundamentales, objeto de estudio, para extraer las claves y la manera en que se desarrolla dicho proceso. El pensamiento gráfico se encuentra íntimamente unido a su modo de expresión. El estudio de ese proceso de pensamiento basado principalmente en imágenes, permite establecer analogías en la manera en que ambos autores hacen uso del dibujo para imaginar acontecimientos evocadores de emociones que definan el carácter dramático de sus ideas. La conexión y yuxtaposición de imágenes mentales, como operaciones de montaje que alientan la construcción de ideas, conceptos y sensaciones, son claves en el curso de la concepción arquitectónica y cinematográfica, y el dibujo, una herramienta que permite a ambos autores su desarrollo. La aproximación al modo en que el arquitecto y el cineasta emprenden el proceso de ideación de sus proyectos a través del dibujo, se aborda desde las estrategias gráficas de cuatro autores: Sergei Eisenstein, Le Corbusier, Akira Kurosawa y Rem Koolhaas. La estructura del trabajo se desarrolla en dos bloques. El primero, compuesto por los primeros cuatro capítulos, afronta desde un punto de vista general, la potencialidad de la imagen en el pensamiento gráfico y el papel de la acción gráfica en el curso proyectual que realiza el arquitecto, por un lado, y el director de cine por otro, tratando de extraer las analogías y los puntos de encuentro de ambos autores durante el proceso. El segundo bloque, correspondiente a los cuatro últimos capítulos, aborda el uso del medio gráfico de manera más concreta, en la figura de dos de los arquitectos y dos de los cineastas más influyentes del pasado y del presente siglo, tratando de comprender el papel del dibujo en el desarrollo conceptual de su obra. ABSTRACT Both {{the movie}} {{director and the}} architect explore the potential offered by the image, as the visualization of certain relations that are catalyst of emotions. Cinematography and architecture works {{are a result of}} a thought and they include all the processes that created them, as much as the essential tools to generate the space and the sequence. This thesis aims to get an understanding of the analogies underlying in which architects and movie directors face the creation process of theirs projects from the graphic action. If we consider graphic media as a creative resource in the architectural and the cinematographic project, the sketch or storyboard becomes the fundamental documents, the study object, to decode the clues {{and the way in which}} the process unfolds. Graphic thinking comes across its way of expression. The study of this thinking, based mainly in images, let set up analogies in a way in which both authors use a drawing to <b>imagine</b> events of <b>emotions</b> that define the dramatic nature of their ideas. The connection and juxtaposition of mental images, as editing or montages that encourage the creation of ideas, concepts and sensations, are key in the course of the architectural and the cinematographic conception, and the drawing, a tool that allows both authors their development. The approach to the way the architect and the movie director get to the process of the creation of their projects through the drawing is addressed from the graphic strategies of these four authors: Sergei Eisenstein, Le Corbusier, Akira Kurosawa and Rem Koolhaas. The structure of the work is developed in two blocks. The first one, the first four chapters, face up, from a general point of view, the potential of the image in the graphic thinking and the role of the graphic action in the course of the project, that architects, as well as movie directors, are making trying to find the analogies and common points during the process. The second block, the last four chapters, deal with the use of the graphic media in a more detail manner, taking as example two of the architects and two of the movie directors more influential of the past and the present centuries, trying to understand the role of the drawing in the conceptual development of the their work...|$|R
