5|$|The nationally scarce bulbous foxtail (Alopecurus bulbosus), slender hare's-ear (Bupleurum tenuissimum) and {{sea barley}} (Hordeum marinum) are grazed by sheep on the marshes around the bay. Around Stert Island the nationally rare compact brome (Bromus madritensis) and nationally scarce Ray's <b>knotgrass</b> (Polygonum oxyspermum) can be found.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{is mainly}} on the ground, and the bird's diet {{consists}} mainly of seeds. Oily seeds, {{such as those of}} brassicas, are ignored in favour of more starchy items. Typical food plants include common nettle, docks, common <b>knotgrass,</b> fat hen, common chickweed and yarrow. Grasses are also important, particularly cereals, and grain makes up {{a significant part of the}} food consumed in autumn and winter, wheat and oats being preferred to barley. When not breeding, yellowhammers forage in flocks which can occasionally number hundreds of birds, and often contain other buntings and finches.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the plant}} species within the Forest are trees such as beech, oak, pine, sycamore, yew and <b>knotgrass</b> and thorn undergrowth. Though the Forest is vastly dense and wild, {{there are a}} few paths and clearings. Hagrid, who {{frequently}} travels into the Forest for various reasons, mostly makes these trails. The Forest is also home to an assortment of creatures, many of them dangerous.|$|E
25|$|The Polyjuice Potion {{allows the}} drinker {{to assume the}} {{appearance}} of someone else {{for an hour or}} more depending on the quantity. The potion only causes a physical transformation of the drinker, but clothing and voice is not affected. Its ingredients include fluxweed, <b>knotgrass,</b> lacewing flies, leeches, powdered Bicorn horn, and shredded Boomslang skin. The final component is a bit of the individual to be impersonated; strands of hair are most often used for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|The {{stomach and}} {{intestines}} were examined and tests {{carried out on}} their contents. Scientists identified the man's last meal as porridge or gruel made from grains and seeds, both cultivated and wild. Approximately 40 kinds of seeds were identified, but the porridge was primarily composed of four types: barley, flax, false flax (Camelina sativa) and <b>knotgrass.</b> From the stage of digestion {{it was concluded that}} the man had eaten 12 to 24 hours prior to his death. Porridges were common for people of this time. Because neither meat nor fresh fruit was found in the last meal, it is suggested that the meal was eaten in winter or early spring when these items were not available.|$|E
500|$|Present on {{the site}} is sea <b>knotgrass</b> (Polygonum maritimum), the rarest of the knotgrasses in Britain, and {{currently}} listed as a [...] "schedule 8 species" [...] under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Such plants are afforded greater than usual protection against damaging activities – such as [...] "cutting, picking, destroying or selling." [...] The heathland is both a Special Area of Conservation and a Special Protection Area, part {{of a network of}} the best wildlife sites in Europe.|$|E
6000|$|In his Origin of Species, Mr. Darwin first {{stated that}} flowers had been {{rendered}} conspicuous and beautiful {{in order to}} attract insects, adding: [...] "Hence we may conclude that, if insects had not been developed on the earth, our plants would not have been decked with beautiful flowers, but would have produced only such poor flowers as we see on our fir, oak, nut, and ash trees, on grasses, docks, and nettles, which are all fertilised through the agency of the wind." [...] The argument in favour of this view is now much stronger than when he wrote; for not only have we reason to believe that most of these wind-fertilised flowers are degraded forms of flowers which have once been insect fertilised, but we have abundant evidence that whenever insect agency becomes comparatively ineffective, the colours of the flowers become less bright, their size and beauty diminish, till they are reduced to such small, greenish, inconspicuous flowers as those of the rupture-wort (Herniaria glabra), the <b>knotgrass</b> (Polygonum aviculare), or the cleistogamic flowers of the violet. There is good reason to believe, therefore, not only that flowers have been developed {{in order to attract}} insects to aid in their fertilisation, but that, having been once produced, in however great profusion, if the insect races were all to become extinct, flowers (in the temperate zones at all events) would soon dwindle away, and that ultimately all floral beauty would vanish from the earth.|$|E
60|$|In {{the case}} of plants, the power of {{increase}} is even greater and its effects more distinctly visible. Hundreds of square miles of the plains of La Plata are now covered {{with two or three}} species of European thistle, often to the exclusion of almost every other plant; but in the native countries of these thistles they occupy, except in cultivated or waste ground, a very subordinate part in the vegetation. Some American plants, like the cotton-weed (Asclepias cuiussayica), have now become common weeds over {{a large portion of the}} tropics. White clover (Trifolium repens) spreads over all the temperate regions of the world, and in New Zealand is exterminating many native species, including even the native flax (Phormium tenax), a large plant with iris-like leaves 5 or 6 feet high. Mr. W.L. Travers has paid much attention to the effects of introduced plants in New Zealand, and notes the following species as being especially remarkable. The common <b>knotgrass</b> (Polygonum aviculare) grows most luxuriantly, single plants covering a space 4 or 5 feet in diameter, and sending their roots 3 or 4 feet deep. A large sub-aquatic dock (Rumex obtusifolius) abounds in every river-bed, even far up among the mountains. The common sow-thistle (Sonchus oleraceus) grows all over the country up to an elevation of 6000 feet. The water-cress (Nasturtium officinale) grows with amazing vigour in many of the rivers, forming stems 12 feet long and 3/4 inch in diameter, and completely choking them up. It cost £300 a year to keep the Avon at Christchurch free from it. The sorrel (Rumex acetosella) covers hundreds of acres with a sheet of red. It forms a dense mat, exterminating other plants, and preventing cultivation. It can, however, be itself exterminated by sowing the ground with red clover, which will also vanquish the Polygonum aviculare. The most noxious weed in New Zealand appears, however, to be the Hypochaeris radicata, a coarse yellow-flowered composite not uncommon in our meadows and waste places. This has been introduced with grass seeds from England, and is very destructive. It is stated that excellent pasture was in three years destroyed by this weed, which absolutely displaced every other plant on the ground. It grows in every kind of soil, and is said even to drive out the white clover, which is usually so powerful in taking possession of the soil.|$|E

50|$|Not only do weeds have a {{negative}} impact on quality, and yields of potatoes, but it can also slow down operations when the crop is mature, and ready to harvest. Weeds make farmers less efficient when harvesting, because weeds like bindweeds, and <b>knotgrass,</b> can become tangled in the equipment, resulting in a stop-and-go type of harvest.|$|E
