Although it is possible that rats from different litters can be integrated together, the integration process can be easy or hard.

5|$|The hall cost NOK134.6 million, {{of which}} NOK88.5 million was {{grants from the}} government. The hall opened on 6 May 1993, with a show {{televised}} on national television and with 5,000 guests. It was the 29th indoor ice hockey rink in Norway, and the world's largest cavern hall for public use. At the time of opening, the venue was estimated to incur an operating cost of NOK3 to 4 four million, and an operating deficit of NOK1.7 million. To finance this, the state established a fund similar to other Olympic venues, but the fund only received NOK1 million, {{and the rest of}} the operating costs would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> by the municipality. The venue is owned through Gjøvik Olympiske Anlegg, originally owned 70% by Gjøvik Municipality and 30% by Lillehammer Olympiapark, but later taken entirely over by the municipality.|$|E

5|$|While earlier cases {{expressed}} {{this stage}} of the test as a determination of whether a law is discriminatory, the Court of Appeal has warned against the confusing of the concepts of differentiation and discrimination. A differentiating law is one that draws distinctions between groups of people. A discriminatory law or executive act, on the other hand, is one that contravenes Article 12(1) and hence is unconstitutional. Therefore, the mere finding of a differentiating measure in this first stage does not necessarily make the law discriminatory, as the other two stages will still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> into consideration. If the impugned statute does not contain such a differentiating measure, it is a good law and the objection fails.|$|E
5|$|The entire works was {{upgraded}} between 1956 and 1969, in five distinct phases. The {{plan was}} announced in January 1956, and was expected to cost £1 million. The first phase was {{the construction of a}} filter pressing plant, for which the main contractor was Norwest Construction Co Ltd, while the actual presses and other plant were supplied by S. H. Johnson and Co Ltd. This phase was completed in 1962, and was officially opened by the Lord Mayor on 14 May 1963. The second phase consisted of a preliminary treatment plant, a storm sewage separation plant, and metering of the flows within the plant. This was completed in 1965. The third phase was split into two parts, which initially involved the building of new primary sedimentation tanks. Once these were operational in 1969, the old sedimentation tanks were converted to become temporary storm sewage tanks. This fourth phase was called phase 3b, and was completed in 1970. The final phase was the construction of a sludge incinerator, which was completed in 1969 and meant that the pressed sewage cake did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to Thrybergh to be dumped.|$|E

25|$|Expired {{tetracyclines}} or tetracyclines {{allowed to}} stand at a pH less than 2 are reported to be nephrotoxic due {{to the formation of}} a degradation product, anhydro-4-epitetracycline causing Fanconi syndrome.

Nevertheless, tetracyclines and doxycycline itself <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> with precaution in patients with kidney injury, as they can worsen azotemia due to catabolic effects.|$|E

25|$|Pre-acclimatization is {{when the}} body {{develops}} tolerance to low oxygen concentrations before ascending to an altitude.
