Further, since the dispose pattern usually does not have language support for this, boilerplate code is necessary. Firstly, if a derived class overrides a [...] method in the base class, the overriding method in the derived class generally needs to call the [...] method in the base class, in order to properly release resources held in the base. Secondly, if an object has a [...] "has a" [...] relationship with another object that holds a resource (i.e., if an object indirectly uses a resource through another object that directly uses a resource), should the indirectly using object be disposable? This corresponds to whether the relationship is owning (object composition) or viewing (object aggregation), or even just communicating (association), and both conventions are found (<b>indirect</b> <b>user</b> is responsible for the resource or is not responsible). If the indirect use is responsible for the resource, it must be disposable, and dispose the owned objects when it is disposed (analogous to destroying or finalizing owned objects).|$|E

By examining PCG through these metaphors, we gain the ability to articulate qualities, consequences, affordances, and limitations of existing PCG approaches in relation to design.

3000|$|Here, {{we explain}} {{the reason for}} using ρ ^m_k W_e in the weights of the links of {{indirect}} users from the BS and relays. Without that, due to the low powers of relays and low transmission rates, their demands would not be comparable {{to the demands of}} the BS for direct users, unless the queues in relays grew large. On the other hand, for the links serving the queues of indirect users in the BS, we would have w^ 0 _k=Q^ 0 _k-Q^m(k)_k, ∀ k ∈K-K_ 0. As a result, these would not have enough impact on computing the average demands for indirect users and providing service for them (in the cases that the queue sizes of an <b>indirect</b> <b>user</b> in the BS and relay have the same size, Q^ 0 _k=Q^m(k)_k, the impact would be zero). Consequently, the queues of indirect users in the BS would usually have larger sizes than the queues of direct users, and therefore, data admission for them would be less. This would degrade the usefulness of drift-plus-penalty for cellular networks, because fairness is usually one of the main concerns in these networks.

Relevant characteristics of the two users are represented in two user models. Explanation strategies are represented in planning operators whose preconditions encode the cognitive state of the indirect user; this allows tailoring the message to the indirect user's characteristics. Expansion of optional subgoals and selection among candidate operators is made by applying decision criteria represented as metarules, that negotiate between direct and indirect users' views also taking into account the context where explanation is provided. After the message has been generated, the direct user may ask to add or remove some items, or change the message style. The system defends the indirect user's needs as far as possible by mentioning the rationale behind the generated message.

Whale-watching vessels are <b>indirect</b> <b>users</b> of herring; whales feed on herring and may disperse when prey availability is low. A dataset of daily whale-watching outcomes is combined with fishing effort and oceanographic data to test the hypothesis that intensive fishing effort increases the search time of whale-watching companies. Our results suggest that fishing may have a detrimental impact on search time; however, the magnitude of this effect is fairly small. We find policy that the recently enacted policy which prohibits fishing for herring in whale-watching areas would decrease search times by a small amount. We find some evidence of a localized aggregation effect; search times are the lowest when herring are spawning in the inshore areas. These results should be of interest to policymakers in determining future fishing regulations in an ecosystem-based fisheries management context.
