5000|$|... 1 IU of {{tocopherol}} {{is defined}} as ⅔ milligrams of RRR-alpha-tocopherol (formerly named d-alpha-tocopherol or sometimes ddd-alpha-tocopherol). 1 IU is also defined as 1 milligram of an equal mix of the eight stereoisomers, which is a racemic mixture called all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate. This mix of stereoisomers is often called <b>dl-alpha-tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate,</b> {{even though it is}} more precisely dl,dl,dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate). However, 1 IU of this racemic mixture is not now considered equivalent to 1 IU of natural (RRR) α-tocopherol, and the Institute of Medicine and the USDA now convert IU's of the racemic mixture to milligrams of equivalent RRR using 1 IU racemic mixture = 0.45 [...] "milligrams α-tocopherol".|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare the {{efficacy}} of dietary alpha-tocopherol with that of <b>dl-alpha-tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate,</b> both either alone or in combination with vitamin C (ascorbic acid), on the growth performance, survival, and stress resistance of angelfish, Pterophylum scalare, juveniles. Juveniles were fed ad libitum for four weeks with Artemia enriched with no vitamins (control), vitamin C (T-c), alpha-tocopherol (T-alpha), <b>dl-alpha-tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> (T (dl)), alpha-tocopherol and vitamin C (T alpha+C), and <b>dl-alpha-tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> and vitamin C (T (dl+C)). After four weeks, an osmotic stress test was performed using seawater (25 g/L) to evaluate juvenile's resistance to stress. Whole-body glucose and cortisol were used as stress indicators. At {{the end of the}} feeding trial, growth performance and survival of the juveniles fed vitamin-enriched Artemia were significantly (P 0. 05) different between the vitamin-fed groups. Osmotic stress significantly elevated the stress indicators, whole-body cortisol and glucose levels (P < 0. 05), highest and lowest values being observed in control and T alpha+C groups, respectively. Survival after osmotic stress of juveniles fed the T alpha+c diet was significantly higher (by 46. 2 %, P < 0. 001) than for controls. Results suggested that alpha-tocopherol has greater efficacy than <b>dl-alpha-tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> and enriching Artemia with alpha-tocopherol and vitamin C together improves growth performance, survival, and stress resistance of angelfish juveniles...|$|E
40|$|Natural vitamin E is {{suggested}} {{to have an}} antioxidant function. However, the synthetic form of vitamin E, DL-tocopherol, which has been widely used in topical ointments, may cause allergic contact dermatitis. Here, we report a case of allergic contact dermatitis with erythema multiforme-like eruption caused by a topical ointment. Patch testing indicated a positive allergic reaction to an anti-inflammatory ointment the patient had been using and its ingredient, <b>DL-alpha-tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> (vitamin E). In addition, a positive reaction to glycyrrhetinic acid was observed. Both vitamin E and glycyrrhetinic acid are useful ingredients of topical applications. However, the possibility that both can cause contact dermatitis, albeit rarely, should be considered...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were designed to study the digestion and metabolism of vitamin E in growing swine. Through the analysis of serum samples of weanling pigs from two swine herds indicated that genetic background {{had an effect on}} vitamin E and selenium status. A wide variation was detected in serum alpha-tocopherol (ALPHA) concentration (P 3 ̆c. 001), glutathione peroxidase (P 3 ̆c. 001) and lactic acid dehydrogenase (P 3 ̆c. 01) activity among genetic lines. Within a herd, pigs were reared under similar environment, nutrition and management. The digestibility of <b>dl-alpha-tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> (dl-ACE) and d-alpha-tocopheryl acid succinate (d-SUCC) was efficient and did not differ in 20 to 40 kg pigs fed at 1. 0 to 1. 4...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that decreased immune responsiveness in the elderly may be counteracted by the antioxidant vitamin E. In a 3 -month double-blind placebo-controlled intervention trial among elderly subjects aged 65 years and over we studied the effects of a daily dose of 100 mg <b>dl-alpha-tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> on the cellular immune responsiveness (n 52) measured by the in vitro response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to the mitogens concanavalin A (ConA) and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). Also effects on the humoral immune responsiveness (n 74) were investigated by measuring immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgG 4 and IgA antibody concentrations against various common antigens. In the vitamin E group plasma alpha-tocopherol increased by 51 % (P = 0. 0001) during intervention whereas no significant changes were observed in the control group. Initial proliferative PBMC responses differed between the vitamin E group and the control group whereas all other baseline characteristics were comparable. No significant changes were observed in cellular immune responsiveness when adjusted for initial values in either the control group or the vitamin E group and, after the trial period, responses in the two groups were not significantly different. Similarly, in the vitamin E group no significant changes were found in levels of IgG and IgA raised against Penicillium or IgG 4 raised against egg, milk, or wheat proteins. In the control group small but significant increases in IgG anti-Penicillium (P < 0. 05) and decreases in IgG 4 against milk proteins (P < 0. 05) were observed. Thus, {{the results of this study}} performed with the relatively low dose of 100 mg <b>dl-alpha-tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> do not support the claims of a beneficial effect of vitamin E intake on the overall immune responsiveness of elderly subjects...|$|E
40|$|Thirty male lambs were {{assigned}} to one of 3 concentrate diets supplemented with 45 (El)), 286 (El)) or 551 (E 2) mg/kg DM of <b>DL-alpha-tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> to test the effect of vitamin E supplementation on muscle, caudal and perirenal fatty acid (FA) compositions. Specific attention was paid to C 18 : 1 10 t, usually observed in high proportions with high-starch or high-unsaturated FA diets. Vitamin E supplementation increased the a-tocopherol plasma concentrations of lambs. It did not modify lamb growth and slaughter parameters. Vitamin E supplementation did not modify FA composition in most tissues but it increased the C 18 : 2 n- 6 /C 18 : 3 n- 3 ratio in muscle and adipose tissues of the El group compared to E 0 and E 2 groups. Vitamin E supplementation enhanced the C 18 : 1 10 t proportion in muscle and adipose tissues and it decreased the C 18 : 2 9 c, 11 t proportion in adipose tissues, especially in the E 2 group. These changes may not be favourable for the nutritional value of lamb meat. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Fasting dogs do {{transport}} vitamin A (VA) in plasma {{not only}} as retinol but predominantly as retinyl esters. Contrary to retinol, nothing is known concerning the effects of athletic performance on plasma retinyl ester concentrations. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to examine whether physical stress because of exercise and modification of the oxidative stress by supplementation of alpha-tocopherol influences the concentrations of retinol and retinyl esters in plasma of sled dogs. The study was carried out on 41 trained adult sled dogs, which were randomly assigned into two groups. One group (19 dogs) was daily substituted with 50 mg <b>dl-alpha-tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> per kilogram body weight and the control group (22 dogs) was maintained on a basal diet during 3 months prior to exercise. The plasma concentrations of retinol, retinyl esters, alpha-tocopherol and triglycerides were measured immediately before, directly after and 24 h after exercise. The supplementation of alpha-tocopheryl acetate had no effect on plasma retinol and retinyl ester concentrations at any measurement time point. However, retinyl ester levels doubled in the non-supplemented group immediately after the race (p < 0. 001), whereas in the supplemented group similar high levels were observed not until 24 h post-racing (p < 0. 001). The high levels of retinyl esters were paralleled to some extent by an increase in plasma triglyceride concentrations, which were significantly higher 24 h post-racing than immediately before (p < 0. 001) and after exercise (p < 0. 001) in both groups. The increase in retinyl ester concentrations might be indicative of their mobilization from liver and adipose tissue. Whether plasma retinyl esters can be used as an indicator for the extent of nutrient mobilization during and post-exercise in sled dogs remains to be elucidated...|$|E
