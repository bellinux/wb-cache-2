25|$|A {{street network}} pattern {{can affect the}} {{production}} of pollutants {{by the amount of}} car travel that it necessitates and the speed at which cars can travel. The grid plan with its frequent intersections may displace a portion of the local car trips with walking or biking due to the directness of route that it offers to pedestrians. But it also makes the same routes more direct for cars, which could be an enticement for driving. The potential car trip displacement would result in a reduction of pollutant emissions. The advantage of the intersection density for pedestrians, however, can have a contrary effect for cars due to its potential for reducing speeds. Low speeds below 20 mph have a significantly higher coefficient of pollutant production than above 30, though the coefficient after leveling off tends to increase gradually after 50 mph. This effect is accentuated with <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> in areas with commercial uses where speeds come to a crawl. Since the grid plan is non-hierarchical and intersections are frequent, all streets can be subject to this potential reduction of average speeds, leading to a high production of pollutants. Greenhouse and noxious gases can be detrimental to the environment and to resident health.|$|E

2500|$|The first earth {{tracks were}} created by humans {{carrying}} goods and often followed trails. [...] Tracks would be naturally created at points of <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>density.</b> [...] As animals were domesticated, horses, oxen and donkeys became an element in track-creation. [...] With the growth of trade, tracks were often flattened or widened to accommodate animal traffic. Later, the travois, a frame used to drag loads, was developed. [...] Animal-drawn wheeled vehicles were probably developed in the Ancient Near East in the 4th or 5th millennium BC and spread to Europe and India in the 4th millennium BC and China in about 1200 BC. [...] The Romans had a significant need for good roads to extend and maintain their empire and developed Roman roads.|$|E

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the complexity factors that affect controller workload under higher levels of automation for conflict detection and resolution and under <b>higher</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>densities</b> is critical for future operations. This paper examines traffic complexity variables under higher levels of automation where the human controller {{is still in the}} loop, but is being supported by advanced conflict detection and resolution automation. The study involved two conflict resolution automation modes (i. e., trial-planning automation and advisory automation) and three <b>traffic</b> <b>densities</b> (i. e., 1 X, 2 X and 3 X). The results indicate that under the 1 X traffic condition, controller workload was the lowest with advanced levels of automation. The complexity and workload increased progressively for the 2 X and 3 X traffic conditions. Results also showed that several variables such as horizontal proximity, aircraft density, separation criticality index, and two degrees of freedom indices appear to be relevant complexity measures for <b>higher</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>densities.</b> The degrees of freedom index for aircraft in conflict appears to be a relevant measure for higher levels of automation. Regression results show that automation resolution mode, number of aircraft, number of conflicts, separation criticality index, and degrees of freedom for aircraft in conflict represent complexity an...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} {{the first evidence}} linking airfares {{to the structure of}} airline hub-and-spoke networks. The hypothesis tested is that any force that increases traffic volume on the spokes of a network will reduce fares in the markets it serves. This effect arises because of economies of density on the spokes. For example, since a large network (as measured by the number of city pairs that it connects) is expected to have low costs per passenger as a result of <b>high</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>densities,</b> fares in the individual markets served should be low, other things equal. Similarly, holding size fixed, a network that connects large cities should have <b>higher</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>densities</b> on its spokes (and thus lower fares in individual markets) than one serving small cities. Our empirical analysis supports these predictions. We find that network characteristics are important determinants of fares in 4 -segment city-pair markets (these are markets requiring a connection at the hub). Furthermore, our empirical model predicts that the TWA-Ozark and Northwest-Republic mergers should have reduced fares in the 4 -segment markets served by the hubs at St. Louis and Minneapolis. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{methodology}} {{to design}} the range policy of Adaptive Cruise Control vehicles and its companion servo-loop control algorithm are presented in this paper. A nonlinear range policy for improved traffic flow stability and string stability is proposed and its performance is compared against the Constant Time-Headway policy, the range policy employed by human drivers and the Greenshields policy. The proposed range policy is obtained through an optimization procedure with traffic flow and stability constraints. A complementary controller is then designed based on the sliding mode technique. Microscopic simulation results show that stable traffic flow is achieved by the proposed method, up to a significantly <b>higher</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>density.</b> Index Terms—Adaptive Cruise Control, range policy, string stability, traffic flow stability...|$|R
