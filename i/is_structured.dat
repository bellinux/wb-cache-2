It has been noted by music writers for recontextualizing Scott-Heron's narratives in Jamie xx's own musical influences and tastes.|$|E

5|$|The palace <b>is</b> <b>structured</b> {{around a}} large and paved courtyard. It has a {{trapezoidal}} plan, and the land falls away toward the river Ill.

The half-buried floor corresponds to the basement and now houses the archaeological museum (see below, Museums). The riverside façade is thus both the highest and the widest of the palace. The terrace before it, facing the quai des Bateliers, is closed at both ends by elaborate wrought-iron gates adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan.|$|E

Only two of these hymns are Christmas carols.|$|E
