In addition to facing uncertainty over their labor income, agents also face wealth shocks that stem from unexpected changes in family composition or from unexpected medical expenses.

40|$|The new Basic Safety Standards (BSS) of the European Union for {{protection}} of the public against the dangers of ionising radiation contain nuclide specific <b>exemption</b> <b>levels</b> on reporting. These <b>exemption</b> <b>levels</b> are much lower for the natural radionuclides (10 or even 1 Bq/g, depending on the radionuclide) than under the old directive (500 Bq/g for natural radionuclides). As a consequence, industrial activities with certain minerals or raw materials containing elevated concentrations of radionuclides, which were exempted from the radiation protection control system under the old directive, {{may have to be}} declared as radiologically relevant activities and may come under regulatory control. Examples of these activities are the phosphate ore processing, the refining of a number of metals, the use of slag, and the oil and natural gas production. This might give rise, in some cases, to large volumes of waste which should be treated, conditioned and disposed in a controlled way. Because of the relatively high <b>exemption</b> <b>levels</b> under the old BSS, regulators in most of the Member States of the European Union have hardly been concerned with radiation protection issues in these industries. By order of the European Commission, we have carried out a study on the implications of the new BSS for this type of industrial activities and to recommend pragmatic approaches for regulating the management of large volumes of waste generated by these industries. The paper gives an overview of the <b>exemption</b> <b>levels</b> for natural radionuclides in the new BSS.

This group of products includes, for instance, ionisation smoke detectors and timepieces with radium-painted dials.

In 1996 the European Council laid down basic safety standards in Directive 96 / 29 /Euratom for protecting the health of the general public from the dangers arising from ionising radiation. The Directive contains activity concentrations and total activity per radionuclide, the so-called <b>exemption</b> <b>levels,</b> below which a practice using this radionuclide is exempted from the duty to report.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} different risk sharing arrangements under incomplete financial markets on macroeconomic outcomes. The first two chapters are joint work with Giacomo Rodano. In the first chapter, we {{examine the effects of}} Chapter 7 of the US bankruptcy law on entrepreneurs. The latter are subject to production risk. They can borrow and in case they fail they can default on their debt. We examine the optimal wealth <b>exemption</b> <b>level</b> and the optimal credit market exclusion duration in this environment. In addition to unsecured credit, entrepreneurs can also obtain secured credit in the second chapter. Secured credit lowers the cost of a generous bankruptcy regime because agents who are rationed out of the unsecured credit market can still obtain secured credit. Therefore, the optimal <b>exemption</b> <b>level</b> is relatively high. In the third chapter, I investigate the effects of wealth exemptions on interest rates if entrepreneurs can choose the riskiness of their project. The default possibility leads to a kink in the value function which makes agents locally risk-loving. In the fourth chapter, I focus on consumers only. In particular, I show that wealth exemptions are of particular importance in a model with expense shocks. Wealth exemptions encourage people to save more so that aggregate savings rise. The model is also consistent with the fact that consumer bankruptcy cases are not correlated with wealth exemption levels. The fifth chapter is joint work with Rigas Oikonomou. We compare two environments: on the one hand the standard one in which a household consists of one member and, on the other hand, one in which a household consists of two members who share their risks perfectly.

The ﬁrst two chapters are joint work with Jochen Mankart. In the ﬁrst chapter, we examine the eﬀects of Chapter 7 of the US bankruptcy law on entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are subject to production risk. They can borrow and if they fail they can default on their debt. We examine the optimal wealth <b>exemption</b> <b>level</b> and the optimal credit market exclusion duration in this environment. In the second chapter, we introduce secured credit, in addition to unsecured credit in a model that is similar to the one in the ﬁrst chapter. Secured credit lowers the cost of a generous bankruptcy regime because agents who are rationed out of the unsecured credit market can still obtain secured credit. Therefore, the optimal <b>exemption</b> <b>level</b> is very high. In the third chapter, I estimate stochastic process for earnings of Italian individuals. I ﬁnd that individual’s earnings present statistically signiﬁcant heterogeneity both in levels and in growth rates that is determined before the beginning of economic activity.

40|$|Abstract: The recent {{explosion}} in personal bankruptcy filings has motivated research into whether credit markets are being {{adversely affected by}} generous legal provisions. Empirically, this question is examined by comparing credit conditions and bankruptcy exemptions across states. We note that the literature has focused on aggregate household credit, making no distinction between secured and unsecured credit. We argue that such aggregation obscures important differences in forms of credit. Most significantly, property exemptions do not prevent the home mortgage creditor from foreclosing on the home if not fully repaid. We argue that some property exemptions may in fact have some beneficial effects for home mortgage lenders. Using both household-level data and state-level data, we show that in the 1990 's high <b>exemption</b> <b>levels</b> have tended to reduce mortgage rates and reduce the probability of being denied a mortgage.
