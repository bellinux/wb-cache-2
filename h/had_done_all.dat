5|$|In early 1880 Hicks Beach {{forwarded}} {{a scheme}} for South African federation to the Cape Parliament. Kruger travelled to the Cape to agitate against the proposals alongside Joubert and Jorissen; {{by the time}} they arrived the Liberals had won an election victory in Britain and Gladstone was Prime Minister. In Cape Town, Paarl and elsewhere Kruger lobbied vigorously against the annexation and won much sympathy. Davenport suggests that this contributed to the federation plan's withdrawal, which in turn weakened the British resolve to keep the Transvaal. Kruger and Joubert wrote to Gladstone asking him to restore the South African Republic's independence, but to their astonishment the Prime Minister replied in June 1880 that he feared withdrawing from the Transvaal might lead to chaos across South Africa. Kruger concluded that they <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> they could to try to regain independence peacefully, and over the following months the Transvaal burghers prepared for rebellion. Wolseley was replaced as Governor and High Commissioner by Sir George Pomeroy Colley.|$|E
5|$|On 21 May 1809, Napoleon {{crossed the}} Danube {{not far from}} Vienna and {{attacked}} Archduke Charles's Austrian army, situated on the northern bank of the river, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The French were nonetheless critically outnumbered and it soon became obvious that they would have a hard time just holding out. Nansouty could only get one of his brigades, Saint-Germain's 3rd and 12th cuirassiers, across the Danube for the action on 21 May. He found the heroic cuirassiers of General Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne charging, as they <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> day long, in a desperate attempt to stop Austrian attacks on the thin French battle line. Espagne had just been killed in action and his exhausted and depleted squadrons needed to be relieved. Nansouty at once brought forward Saint-Germain's squadrons and charged the enemy infantry, allowing the army to maintain itself on the position.|$|E
5|$|On November 4, Wayne ordered Scott's militiamen {{to destroy}} a nearby Delaware village. Still resentful and distrustful of federal {{officers}} and aware that Wayne would not launch a major offensive so close to winter, the men were not enthusiastic about the mission, which many of them considered trivial. That night, 501 of them deserted their camp, though Wayne noted in his report that he believed Scott and his officers <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> {{they could do to}} prevent the desertions. Scott attempted to continue the mission with his remaining men, but inclement weather prevented him from conducting a major offensive. Ultimately, the men were only able to disperse a small hunting camp before continuing on to Fort Washington and mustering out on November 10. Wayne ordered Scott to return with a full quota of troops after the winter.|$|E

5|$|The Earl of Warwick's rival for {{leadership}} of the new regime was Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton, whose conservative supporters had allied with Dudley's followers to create a unanimous Council, which they, and observers such as the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V's ambassador, expected to reverse Somerset's policy of religious reform. Warwick, on the other hand, pinned his hopes on the king's strong Protestantism and, claiming that Edward {{was old enough to}} rule in person, moved himself and his people closer to the king, taking control of the Privy Chamber. Paget, accepting a barony, joined Warwick when he realised that a conservative policy would not bring the emperor onto the English side over Boulogne. Southampton prepared a case for executing Somerset, aiming to discredit Warwick through Somerset's statements that he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> with Warwick's co-operation. As a counter-move, Warwick convinced parliament to free Somerset, which it did on 14 January 1550. Warwick then had Southampton and his followers purged from the Council after winning the support of Council members in return for titles, and was made Lord President of the Council and great master of the king's household. Although not called a Protector, he was now clearly the head of the government.|$|E

25|$|Returning to Michigan {{under the}} power of Gage was unthinkable; hence, Rogers went to England in 1769 to {{petition}} again for debt relief. However, the king <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> he would for Rogers and was preoccupied by {{the issue of the}} dissatisfied colonies. Rogers went again to debtors' prison and tried suing Gage for false imprisonment. Gage settled out of court by offering Rogers the half-pay of a Major in return for dropping the suit.|$|E

25|$|Australia and England {{drew the}} Test and series 1–1, with Australia {{retaining}} the Ashes {{for the fourth}} time after regaining them in 1958–59. It was the second time the two teams had drawn the series in the last three Ashes series, with 15 of the 20 Tests being drawn (the next series was also drawn 1–1). It had already been realised that the captains on both sides were unusually cautious when playing each other as so much was at stake even though Bobby Simpson and Mike Smith <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> that they could to make the games interesting.|$|E
25|$|On {{assessing}} Greenwichs strength, the frigate kept {{close to}} the squadron, which then came up and attacked, action commencing at 9 a.m. when Diadème opened fire. For the next twelve hours Greenwich was constantly engaged with one or other of the French ships. Roddam still hoped to carry his plan of capturing one of them into execution, and assembled his men {{in an attempt to}} board the 64-gun Éveillé, but several of her consorts bore up and opened fire, damaging Greenwichs rigging and leaving her unmanageable. Roddam gathered his officers together, and told them that though they had no hope of winning against such a superior force, if any man could point out the admiral's flagship, he hoped to engage her and fight on for another hour or two. His officers, among whom was Lieutenant James Wallace, pledged to follow their captain, but pointed out that they <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> in their power to defend their ship. At 9.30 p.m., Roddam agreed to surrender his ship, as further resistance would only cause further casualties among his men.|$|E
500|$|On 14 November at 06:30 4th Light Horse Brigade entered El Tineh {{with the}} rest of the Australian Mounted Division {{following}} a couple of hours later.

The horses <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> that had been asked of them, existing during this time on only 9lbs of grain ration (practically no bulk food) and scarce water while all the time carrying about [...] That they were able to carry on into the Judean Hills after only a limited period of rest established a remarkable record. Meanwhile, the Australian Mounted Divisional Supply Train followed the fighting units as closely as they could, moving out from Beersheba via Hareira and Gaza on 11 November to Isdud on 14 November; to Mesymie the day after and Junction Station on 16 November.|$|E

500|$|Sagan {{celebrated his}} victory {{by doing a}} wheelie after the {{finishing}} line. He said afterwards {{that it was the}} hardest Tour of Flanders he had ever raced, having been [...] "full gas" [...] throughout and suggested that Cancellara had made a mistake by not following the attack he had made with Kwiatkowski and Vanmarcke. Cancellara was emotional after finishing his final Tour of Flanders. He said that he had [...] "missed this one second", referring to the attack by Sagan. He said that he and Vanmarcke <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> they could in the chase, but that Sagan was too strong. Vanmarcke, meanwhile, said that he had struggled due to crashes in the middle part of the race and then had suffered cramp when Sagan attacked on the Paterberg. He described the move by Sagan and Kwiatkowski as the [...] "decisive moment in the race".|$|E

500|$|Having been {{promoted}} to acting flight lieutenant, Rowland was on a sortie to attack Düsseldorf in December 1944 when he lost one of his engines. He nevertheless continued on to the target where, owing to his lower-than-normal altitude, his aircraft was seriously damaged by anti-aircraft fire before and after he dropped his bombs. Nursing his plane back to base, he was recommended for the Distinguished Flying Cross in recognition of his [...] "great determination and devotion to duty"; the award was promulgated in the London Gazette on 16February 1945. In January 1945, Rowland's Lancaster collided with a Canadian bomber over Frankfurt, {{and he had to}} bail out with his surviving crew. Captured and held by the Gestapo in solitary confinement, he was scheduled to be executed but was saved by two Luftwaffe officers who had learned of his situation. They took him to a prisoner-of-war camp, where he remained until being repatriated at the end of hostilities. None of Rowland's crew survived the war and, though he believed he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> he could to save them, he suffered survivor guilt.|$|E

500|$|Ravenloft's success led to {{a sequel}} in 1986 titled Ravenloft II: The House on Gryphon Hill. Although Tracy Hickman was {{credited}} in RavenloftII, he had left TSR before the module was completed. The writing was done by David [...] "Zeb" [...] Cook, Jeff Grubb, Harold Johnson, and Douglas Niles, following the Hickmans' outline. Each writer pursued a different section of the module {{in order to meet}} the deadline. Clyde Caldwell, who <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> of the art for the original Ravenloft module, provided the cover, but interior art was done by Jeff Easley. The adventure is designed for first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons characters of levels 8–10. The adventure was 48 pages, and included a large color map and an outer folder. It shared structural elements with the original, including variable NPC goals and variable locations for key objects, so that Gryphon Hill plays differently each time. The module's plot features an artifact known as The Apparatus that switches a monster's personality with that of an ordinary townsperson; player characters, therefore, are uncertain about the true identity of the people they meet. The module also introduces Azalin the lich, who later became a major character in the Ravenloft campaign setting. This module is playable alone, or as a sequel to the original Ravenloft. It includes descriptions of the town of Mordentshire, as well as some haunted moors, and a manor house, all mapped in perspective like the original module.|$|E
500|$|Seeing their {{disadvantage}} the Spanish second-in-command {{assembled a}} boarding party, at which Cochrane drew off and pounded their massed ranks with shot and musket fire before drawing in close again. After having {{their attempts to}} board frustrated three times, the Spanish returned to their guns. Cochrane then decided to board the Gamo, and assembled his entire crew into two parties, leaving only the ship's doctor aboard. The British rushed the Gamo, some boarding from the bow with faces blackened to look like pirates, the rest boarding from the waist. There was a hard-fought battle between the two crews, until Cochrane called down to the doctor, {{at the time the}} only person on Speedy, ordering him to send another 50 men over. At the same time he ordered the Spanish colours to be torn down. Thinking that their officers had surrendered the ship, the remaining Spanish seamen stopped fighting. The British had lost three men killed and nine wounded, while the Spanish had lost 14 killed and 41 wounded, a casualty list exceeding Speedys entire complement. The British then secured the Spanish prisoners below deck and made their way back to Port Mahon. Stung that he had been beaten by such an inferior foe, the Spanish second-in-command asked Cochrane for a certificate assuring him that he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>all</b> he could to defend his ship. Cochrane obliged, with the equivocal wording that he had [...] "conducted himself like a true Spaniard". Cochrane was amused to learn that this certificate had later secured the Spanish officer further advancement. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp [...] "Speedy 6 May 1801" [...] to all surviving claimants from the action.|$|E
