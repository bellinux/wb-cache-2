5|$|Following {{his release}} from the {{hospital}} and as a prisoner of war—the exact date is unknown—Schnaufer took over the family wine business. He had never planned to run the family winery as his ambition had always been to pursue an officer's career in the Luftwaffe. However, {{in the immediate aftermath}} of World War II the business had virtually ceased to exist and Schnaufer was given the task of rebuilding it from scratch. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> re-establish business links to suppliers and customers and to consolidate them. Then <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make new contacts in order to facilitate expansion and growth of the business. Lastly, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> create an infrastructure which supported the growth of the business.|$|E

5|$|Marseille {{developed}} his own special tactics, which differed {{significantly from the}} methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fly very slowly. He even {{took it to the}} point where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> operate his landing flaps as not to fall down, because, of course <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle.

50|$|Costner:To me, it's like {{picking a}} {{football}} team. The story made sense, {{to play the}} game made sense, and it was obvious that I should play quarterback or end. I mean, Cochran is a role that I should play... The movie needed Anthony Quinn more than it needed me. I mean, there are probably five or six guys who could play Cochran's role, but who else is there who could play the role of Tibbey? The Tiburon character <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be really charming and Anthony has that in spades. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> danger and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> presence. Anthony <b>has</b> that because <b>he's</b> been a leading man all his life. And <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be that age.|$|R
