25|$|Since Bosniaks compose roughly 70.4% of Federation's population, Croats 22.4% and Serbs {{just around}} 2%, Parliament's <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peoples</b> (with equal {{representation}} {{for all three}} nationalities) is supposed {{to ensure that the}} interests of Croats, Serbs and national minorities are fairly represented during government creation and in the legislative process. Since 2001-02 and foreign-imposed amendments to the constitution and electoral laws, Bosnian Croats have claimed the election system for the deputies in the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peoples</b> is rigged, depriving them of their rights to representation and in fact enabling Bosniaks to control the majority in the upper house as well. Namely, after 2002 each nations' deputies to the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peoples</b> are elected by 10 Cantonal assemblies, 6 of them with clear Bosniak majority. This dismantled checks the Federation's Croats and Serbs had on the Federal legislature as well as the executive, particularly government-building. In 2010-14 Federation's Government was formed by Bosniak SDP without the consent of major Croat political parties. After Croatian politician Božo Ljubić filed an appeal, in December 2016 Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina found the election system of the deputies in the <b>House</b> <b>of</b> <b>Peoples</b> unconstitutional and abrogated the controversial rules.|$|E
