The market socialists pointed out the formal {{similarity}} between the neoclassical model of Walrasian general equilibrium and that of market socialism. Simply replace the Walrasian auctioneer with a planning board. However, this emphasizes the shortcomings of the model. According to Lavoie, the market socialists, by relying on this formal similarity must adopt the simplifying assumptions of the model. The model assumes that various sorts of information are [...] "given" [...] to the auctioneer or planning board. But without a capital market this information does not exist, {{and if it does}} exist, it exists in a fundamentally distributed form, unavailable to the planners. If the planners somehow captured this information, it would immediately become stale and relatively useless, unless reality somehow imitated the changeless monotony of the equilibrium model. The existence and usability of this information depends on its creation and situation within a distributed <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E

We show that, under a {{coherent}} decision theoretic framework, a loss function combining true positive and false positive counts {{leads to a}} decision rule {{that is based on}} a threshold of the posterior probability of the alternative. Under a semiparametric model for the data, we show that the Bayes rule can be approximated by the optimal <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure,</b> which was recently introduced by Storey. Improving the approximation leads us to a Bayesian <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure,</b> which exploits the multiple shrinkage in clusters that are implied by the assumed non-parametric model. We compare the Bayesian <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure</b> and the optimal <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure</b> estimates in a simple simulation study and in an assessment of differential gene expression based on microarray data from tumour samples. We extend the setting of the optimal <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure</b> by discussing modifications of the loss function that lead to different single-thresholding statistics. Finally, we provide an application of the previous arguments to dependent (spatial) data. Copyright (c) 2009 Royal Statistical Society. ...|$|E

30|$|The <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure</b> of AODV {{is based}} on {{flooding}} REQUEST packets. These control packets are flooded and forwarded throughout the network until {{one or more of}} them reach the destination node. The main drawbacks of flooding <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure</b> are (1) implosion caused by duplicated control messages, (2) overlap which occurs whenever two nodes sensing the same area send similar packets to the same neighboring node, and (3) resource blindness that consumes large amount of energy without considering individual nodes' [4]. As a result, this <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure</b> may cause a massive overhead in the network since no control over the distribution of the control packets exists. The overhead worsens the performance of the network and hence must be avoided as far as possible. In this article, an optimized <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure</b> is presented, based on the mobility parameters and the number of hops which forms a communication path. The proposed <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure</b> works as described below.|$|E

30|$|We propose two new MN-initiated schemes, {{in which}} the <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure</b> is {{activated}} by the MN. These two schemes can find appropriate MRT routers within fewer control messages than HA-initiated schemes. Therefore, the signaling overhead can be significantly reduced. These two MN-initiated schemes can provide a more efficient <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure</b> while avoiding the security problems that affect other schemes. However, if the communication model is peer-to-peer, the communication may be started with the CN. The MN can activate the <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure</b> when the MN receives the first tunneled packet sent by the CN.|$|E

In fact the number is neither predictable or immutable. A simple bracketing process (2 would be incredible; 42 would be absurd) quickly gives a range of 3 - 10 as reasonable, with mid-values `feeling about right'.

40|$|This Essay {{addresses}} {{issues involving}} {{the discovery of}} information located outside the United States. Specifically, it deals {{with some of the}} problems created by the lack of appropriate limits on United States <b>discovery</b> <b>procedures.</b> Professor Gerber first analyzes the extent of judicial discretion in the United States in matters concerning extraterritorial discovery. The analysis encompasses the underlying legal bases for the exercise of discretion as well as the political and institutional factors that influence the uses of discretion. Next, the Essay focuses on the international consequences of the virtually unlimited discretion courts in the United States exercise in discovery matter. The analysis indicates that domestic justifications for unlimited discretion in discovery have little relevance in the extraterritorial discovery context. Further, unregulated transnational discovery can result in potentially serious and generally unrecognized harms. The Author concludes that while a significant measure of judicial discretion is necessary in making discovery decisions, transnational discovery requires a framework of analysis that differs in important respects from the analysis applicable in domestic discovery. Professor Gerber views conceptual guidance in in this area as a necessity, both to limit adverse international legal, economic, and political consequences and to provide fair and efficient <b>discovery</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R

30|$|The power {{transmission}} of devices is usually fixed by designing factors so the network designer {{does not have}} any control over it. It depends on the wireless technology used [25]. On other hand, the link quality factors depend on the environment and it can be unpredictable or changeable. As a consequence, making use of mobility and positioning factors is the easiest way to estimate path duration. In this article, a novel approach for improving path selection based on mobility and positioning factors is proposed. It is aimed at reactive routing protocols. A decision tree has been included into a reactive routing like Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) [26] in order to accomplish the proposed approach. Additionally, an improved <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure</b> of routes is proposed. It is based on mobility and the number of hops forming the communication routes. The objectives of this <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure</b> are (1) to help to increment the path duration and (2) {{to reduce the number of}} control packets used during the <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E
30|$|Since routes {{with lower}} path metric last {{only for a}} short time, the {{overhead}} caused by these paths do not compensate for the short duration of their paths. In the optimized <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure,</b> whenever a node receives a request packet with low LM, it will not forward the request packet. As a result, short lifetime paths do not {{take part in the}} communications. For example, in Figure 10, the nodes E and F will not participate in the <b>discovery</b> <b>procedure</b> because the LM in both cases is equal to zero, which is the lowest metric possible. This approach favors the usage of durable path.|$|E
30|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on reactive and proactive routing protocols [12, 13]. In reactive protocols, each node constructs routes only in the case where communication is required. Power consumption can then be cut when communication is not needed. The delay time, however, is longer for reactive protocols because of their route <b>discovery</b> <b>procedures.</b> This means that reactive protocols are not appropriate for real-time applications. In proactive protocols, end-to-end delay is small. However, there is overhead because all the nodes collect information about links.|$|R
