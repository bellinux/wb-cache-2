Here we demonstrate the application of stack-based genetic program-ming to the <b>digital</b> <b>multiplier</b> problem using the PushGP genetic programming system, which evolves programs ex-pressed in the stack-based Push programming language. We demonstrate the use of output instructions and argue that they provide a natural mechanism for producing multiple outputs in a stack-based genetic programming context.

These developments are the “ULTRA” genetic operator, which produces offspring via“Uniform Lin-ear Transformation with Repair and Alternation ” [12], and “lexicase selection, ” which selects parents according to per-formance on cases considered sequentially in random order [11]. Our results using these techniques show not only their utility, but also the utility of the <b>digital</b> <b>multiplier</b> problem as a benchmark problem for genetic programming research.

While digital circuit performance improves with device scaling, analog circuits have not gained these benefits. As a result, it has become necessary to leverage increased digital circuit performance to mitigate analog circuit deficiencies in nanometer scale CMOS in order to realize world class analog solutions. In this thesis, both circuit and system enhancement techniques to improve performance of clock generators are discussed.
