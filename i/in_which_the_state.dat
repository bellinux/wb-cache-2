25|$|Like it is {{the case}} with all trans-municipal {{metropolitan}} areas in Mexico, there is no elected government institution in charge of administering the entire metropolitan area.

However, unlike some other large metropolitan areas that are entirely contained in one state, like Greater Guadalajara and Greater Monterrey <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> government coordinates metropolitan activities, Greater Mexico City spreads over three federal entities—two states and the Federal District—and therefore most of the metropolitan projects have to be agreed upon by government officials of each federal entity and/or overseen by the federal government—since the budget of the Federal District is approved by the Congress of the Union, being the capital of the federation—or through metropolitan commissions.|$|E

25|$|Under Sultan Barsbay, a state {{monopoly}} was established on luxury goods, namely spices, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> set prices and collected {{a percentage of}} profits. To that end, in 1387, Barsbay established direct control over Alexandria, the principal Egyptian commercial port, thereby transferring the tax revenues of the port to the sultan's personal treasury (diwan al-khass) instead of the imperial treasury which was linked with the military's iqtaʿ system. Furthermore, in 1429, he ordered that the spice trade to Europe be conducted through Cairo before goods reached Alexandria, thus attempting to end the direct transportation of spices from the Red Sea to Alexandria. In the late 15th and early 16th centuries the Portuguese Empire's expansion into Africa and Asia began to significantly decrease the revenues of the Mamluk-Venetian monopoly on the trans-Mediterranean trade. This contributed to and coincided {{with the fall of}} the sultanate.|$|E
25|$|In Milan, Neoclassicism began a {{few years}} later than in its main European counterparts, mainly {{as a result of the}} {{problems}} of succession to the thone of the Austrian empire, with Maria Theresa's lengthy reign. Initially, Neoclassicism in Milan, like the artists who practiced it, was not so much inspired by the classical models of Ancient Rome or Roman Neoclassicism as by developments in London, Paris and Parma. It was a period of great public works covering theatres, libraries and schools, and more generally of important works for the public good, reflecting the ambitions of an enlightened government. It was a period <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> and the government itself led the city's cultural life and progress, promoting and funding new activities and rewarding the most deserving citizens and achievements. During this initial period, Neoclassicism was characterized by a more sober and austere approach, resulting in symmetrical, well-ordered structures.|$|E
25|$|A law on worker’s {{democracy}} in public-sector companies {{was passed in}} July 1983 which sought to recreate a spirit of tripartism in a {{sector of the economy}} where existing statutory rights had failed to provide anything more than a consultative role for representatives. Previously, workers had the right to be represented on the boards of public sector companies with 50 or more staff and were entitled to at least 2 board seats, but under the new legislation, public sector companies (previously nationalized companies plus those companies that were nationalized in 1982 <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> was the majority shareholder) would be obliged to have tripartite administrative or supervisory boards to which employee representatives would be elected by the workforce. A couple of autogestionary measures were also introduced. One measure involved workers’ representation on the administrative councils of the nationalized industries, under which one-third of the members of these councils being drawn from the workforce. The other measure involved elections to the administrative commissions for social security, under which 15 and 25 members of these commissions were chosen through elections among those who were insured by the fund.|$|E

500|$|According to the {{principle}} of a numerical majority, the will of the more numerous citizens should always rule, regardless of the burdens on the minority. [...] Such a principle tends toward a consolidation of power in which the interests of the absolute majority always prevail over those of the minority. Calhoun believed that the great achievement of the American constitution was in checking the tyranny of a numerical majority through institutional procedures that required a concurrent majority, such that each important interest in the community must consent to the actions of government. To secure a concurrent majority, those interests that have a numerical majority must compromise with the interests that are in the minority. A concurrent majority requires a unanimous consent of all the major interests in a community, which is the only sure way of preventing tyranny of the majority. This idea supported Calhoun's doctrine of interposition or nullification, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> governments could refuse to enforce or comply with a policy of the Federal government that threatened the vital interests of the states.|$|E
500|$|In {{this new}} society, the self-alienation would end and humans {{would be free}} to act without being bound by the labour market.

He theorised that between capitalism and the establishment of a socialist/communist system, a dictatorship of the proletariat—a period where the working class holds political power and forcibly socialises the means of production—would exist. As he wrote in his Critique of the Gotha Program, [...] "between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat". While he allowed for the possibility of peaceful transition in some countries with strong democratic institutional structures (such as Britain, the United States and the Netherlands), he suggested that in other countries in what workers can not [...] "attain their goal by peaceful means" [...] the [...] "lever of our revolution must be force".|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} Keith David Watenpaugh, {{the language}} used by Hananu and Saleh al-Ali in their address to the League of Nations [...] "undermine" [...] Arab and Turkish nationalist claims that their revolts represented part of the Arab or Turkish national awakenings. Hananu and al-Ali both referred to their revolts {{as part of a}} unified national resistance movement, but Watenpaugh states that the nation referred to was an Islamic community rather than the ethnic nationalism that steadily dominated Syrian and Turkish politics and society in the 20th century. Hananu and al-Ali also stressed modernist principles about individual rights, and according to Watenpaugh, Hananu did not view the concepts of modernity, Islam and the Ottoman state to be mutually exclusive. Hananu had opposed many Ottoman policies in the pre-World War I period, but was nonetheless wary of separatism as someone who formed part of the educated Ottoman middle class, while al-Ali sought a return to a [...] "decentralized Ottoman polity dominated by Muslims <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> would protect his hegemony as a landowning rural chieftain". Hananu and the rebel commanders had a deep attachment to their place in society and viewed French rule as an assault on their status, ambitions and dignity.|$|E
