The effects of using up to 30 % bagasse chemical pulp in a blend with <b>hardwood</b> CMP <b>pulp,</b> with or without softwood kraft pulp, were studied. The results showed that superior hand sheet properties could be achieved by using bagasse chemical pulp; in comparison with main mill pulp furnish (83 % <b>hardwood</b> CMP <b>pulp</b> and 17 % imported long fiber pulp).

40|$|Although bagasse {{is used as}} a fibre {{source for}} paper {{manufacture}} throughout the world, no bagasse pulp industry exists in Australia. The reasons for this include cost, given the enormous economics of scale achieved by the <b>hardwood</b> <b>pulp</b> mills, the remoteness of cane farms relative to <b>hardwood</b> <b>pulp</b> mills, and processing and environmental issues. The processing issue arises because of the relatively poor drainage properties of bagasse pulp compared to wood pulp. As paper machines are specifically designed to process wood pulp, they are not very effective to dewater bagasse pulp suspensions at an effective rate. This reduces factory productivity and increases energy consumption, thereby impacting negatively on the overall operating costs of a pulp mill. This paper describes an approach that would utilise surface chemistry and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to improve our understanding of bagasse pulp dewatering process. This would lead to developing a process to enhance the physicochemical properties of bagasse fibres and hence the dewatering process...|$|E
40|$|Mangrove wood fibers {{generally}} lack flexibility {{because of}} their thick cell walls. Due to this defect pulps prepared from Mangrove woods form weak and bulky papersheets. Hydoxyethylation {{was applied to the}} Mangrove pulp in order to improve its papermaking properties. A remarkable difference was observed between the behavior of hydroxyethylated Mangrove pulps and that of a hydroxyethylated domestic <b>hardwood</b> <b>pulp</b> studied for comparison. A very slight hydroxyethylation (i. e., hydroxyethylation with the use of 1 % ethylene oxide on the basis of pulp weight) brought about a considerable increase in the sheet strength properties of the Mangrove pulps, while higher levels of hydroxyethylation which caused a marked improvement of the papermaking properties for the domestic <b>hardwood</b> <b>pulp</b> brought deterioration on the Mangrove pulps. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the slightly hydroxyethylated Mangrove pulp fibers were finely fibrillated by refining and suffered remarkable deformation in papersheet formation, while the highly hydroxyethylated fibers suffered little fibrillation and deformation. Results of some other investigations suggest that a partial extraction of hemicelluloses from the thick cell walls contribute to the increase in the flexibility of the fibers and a part of the effect of the slight hydroxyethylation can be attributed to this effect...|$|E

The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of acidolysis on final bleached brightness for kraft and soda-AQ (SAQ) <b>hardwood</b> <b>pulps.</b> The increase in final brightness due to acidolysis at 110 °C was twice as high for a eucalyptus SAQ pulp as compared to the kraft pulp. An oxygen delignified maple C-SAQ pulp (carbonate pre-treated SAQ) was acidolyzed at 120 °C and pH 2. 6 for 30 min. When 1. 60 % ClO 2 + 0. 25 % H 2 O 2 on pulp was used in DEPD final bleaching of the control sample a brightness of 91. 5 % was achieved. When only 1. 00 % ClO 2 + 0. 25 % H 2 O 2 on pulp was used for the acidolyzed sample a brightness of 92. 0 % was attained. Analyses of the maple pulp after the acidolysis showed no major change in lignin content, brightness, or pulp yield. The minor changes suggest that a facile reaction such as benzyl ether cleavage was responsible for the improved bleachability. Preliminary research involving a lignin model compound and commercial birch xylan showed that lignin-carbohydrate condensation products were generated under SAQ cooking conditions.

40|$|The {{white rot}} fungus Trametes (Coriolus) versicolor can delignify and {{brighten}} unbleached hardwood kraft pulp {{within a few}} days, but softwood kraft pulps require longer treatment. To determine the contributions of higher residual lignin contents (kappa numbers) and structural differences in lignins to the recalcitrance of softwood kraft pulps to biobleaching, we tested softwood and hardwood pulps cooked to the same kappa numbers, 26 and 12. A low-lignin-content (overcooked) softwood pulp resisted delignification by T. versicolor, but a high-lignin-content (lightly cooked) <b>hardwood</b> <b>pulp</b> was delignified {{at the same rate}} as a normal softwood pulp. Thus, the longer time taken by T. versicolor to brighten softwood kraft pulp than <b>hardwood</b> <b>pulp</b> results from the higher residual lignin content of the softwood pulp; possible differences in the structures of the residual lignins are important only when the lignin becomes highly condensed. Under the conditions used in this study, when an improved fungal inoculum was used, six different softwood pulps were all substantially brightened by T. versicolor. Softwood pulps whose lignin contents were decreased by extended modified continuous cooking or oxygen delignification to kappa numbers as low as 15 were delignified by T. versicolor {{at the same rate as}} normal softwood pulp.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study the fibre surface {{properties}} of Birch (Betula ssp.), Eucalyptus (E. urograndis and E. globulus) and Spruce (Picea Abies) pulps bleached using two different methods: ECF (Elementary Chlorine Free) and TCF (Totally Chlorine Free). The <b>hardwood</b> <b>pulps</b> were subjected to a hot acidic stage prior to ECF bleaching in order to remove hexenuronic acid. The effect of prolonged storage (ageing) on the fibre surface properties was studied {{for all of the}} pulps. The characteristics of the fibre surfaces were determined by measuring the dynamic contact angle of single fibres (DCA) and by using Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA) and Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS). The correlation between the fibre surface properties and the sizing efficiency of the <b>hardwood</b> <b>pulps</b> were evaluated by measuring the amount of alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) needed to reach a certain water absorption level(measured as Cobb 60). The birch pulp was more hydrophilic than the eucalyptus pulps, thus requiring more AKD to reach a certain water absorption value, and also had a lower DCA. The introduction of a hot acidic stage (A stage) in the ECF bleaching sequence applied to the <b>hardwood</b> <b>pulps</b> (i. e. A/D(EP) DD versus D(EP) DD) lowered, as expected, the total fibre charge due to the removal of hexenuronic acids groups (HexA). According to the DCA measurements all of the pulps became more hydrophilic after the A/D(EP) DD bleaching than after the D(EP) DD bleaching sequence. The sizing ability of the pulps, measured as the AKD demand to a certain Cobb 60 value, showed that the AKD demand was {{more or less the same}} for the eucalyptus pulps regardless of the bleaching sequence used. The birch pulp, on the other hand, required somewhat less AKD in the A/D(EP) DD sequence than in the D(EP) DD. The AKD demand to a certain Cobb 60 value decreased further for the bleached birch and E. globulus pulps after ageing due to an increase in the fibre surface hydrophobicity. ESCA analysis revealed an increase of surface extractives on the pulps after ageing, which was also supported by ToF-SIMS analysis. It was concluded that there was an increase in fatty acids, fatty acid salts and possibly even sterols and glycerides on the fibre surfaces due to ageing. A migration of these components from the interior of the fibre wall to the fibre surface during ageing was verified in this study. The TCF and ECF bleached softwood pulps also showed differences in their fibre surface properties that were tangible and thereby measurable. The dynamic contact angle was highest for the TCF bleached softwood fibres, i. e. these were more hydrophobic. Although changes caused by ageing were much more pronounced for the ECF fibres, all pulps became more hydrophobic upon ageing. The hydrophobicity of pulp fibres can be determined using DCA, which is a rather rapid and economically viable analysis. Using this information, a paper/board mill can base its sizing strategy on scientific findings. The ageing effects seen on the fibre surfaces in the form of the migration of extractives might be an important parameter from an industrial point of view, especially when pulps are stored and/or transported for a long time period. Nowadays it is quite common for pulps to be shipped around the world and subjected to warm and humid conditions. It is therefore probable that the properties of the pulp change in such a way that the papermaking process requires adjustment...|$|R

The hydrolysis was conducted with a dosage of 50 FPU of cellulase at 50  ℃ for 72  h and the yields were measured after 72  h. The yields of the Avicel, UKHP, UKSP and the fines sample were 92 (4.5), 92 (1.3), 58 (1.8) and 44 (1.7), respectively. The yields were determined from an assay of the sugars and the numbers in the parentheses represent the standard deviations determined from hydrolysis runs in triplicates. Nearly all the cellulose in Avicel was readily converted into glucose. Similarly, the conversion of the sample of the unbleached Kraft <b>hardwood</b> <b>pulp</b> (UKHP) was extremely high. Unbleached kraft softwood pulp (UKSP) shows lower yields primarily because this pulp was dried and reslushed before enzymatic hydrolysis. The process of drying causes the pulps to hornify, i.e., limits the accessibility of cellulose by reducing the cell wall porosity. Upon reslushing, therefore, a dried pulp fiber will not rehydrate to the same extent as virgin fibers and the cellulases are blocked from entering the crystalline structure (Cao et al. 1999). The maximum hydrolysis yield was around 44  % of OD (oven dry mass basis) fines and was found at 50 FPU of the enzyme. The maximum hydrolysis yield was the same at 100 FPU but is not shown here.|$|E
