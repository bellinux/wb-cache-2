25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, {{for it is}} things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame {{and that is a}} dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E

[...] Gilmour shares this view: [...] "I for one would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it is my favourite album, the Wish You Were Here album.

The statement sparked controversy, following which Aram Mp3 apologised and added that what he said {{was meant to be a}} joke. Wurst accepted the apology, by stating, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> if it's a joke it's not funny... but he apologised and that's fine for me." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{part of its}} {{marketing}} campaign for The Girl, HBO released a 30-second trailer in August 2012. During a Television Critics Association press tour promoting the film, Hedren said [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> when I first heard Toby's [...] voice as Alfred Hitchcock, my body just froze". Hedren's daughter, Melanie Griffith, attended a screening; when the film ended, the audience was silent until Griffith said [...] "Well, now I {{have to go back}} into therapy again!" [...] Hedren attended a London [...] screening in October. The Girl made its US television debut on HBO and HBO Canada on 20 October 2012. It had its UK premiere on 26 December, as part of BBC Two's Christmas programming. The film was released on DVD in the UK on 7 January 2013.|$|E
500|$|Biographer Taraborrelli commented, [...] "Madonna {{had more}} {{confidence}} in her stage presence, her music was showing a deeper maturity, her voice was fuller, and the show was expertly choreographed with complex numbers. J. D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun commented, [...] "I've seen the Springsteen stadium tour, I've seen Dylan and the [...] Dead, and I was at Live Aid. Out of all those shows, Madonna's {{is the only one}} I want to see again. You need a larger-than-life show if you want to come off in a stadium, and Madonna does. She's not that large physically, but she holds your attention." [...] Ann Ayers, assistant entertainment editor of USA Today felt that the show was high on glitz and low on emotional quotient. [...] "Madonna's going for a certain kind of show: a Broadway, show-biz, song-and-dance spectacle. In that context it's hard to make a connection with the audience, and I'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> she didn't." [...] Peter Goddard from Toronto Star reviewed the concert in CNE Stadium and said, [...] "Madonna proved that she may be a lost girl in the roads of life, like her film, but she ain't lost when she is singing. Especially during songs like 'Papa Don't Preach', her vocal prowess was substantially notable." [...] Scott A Zamost and Elizabeth Snead, writing for Chicago Tribune, felt that [...] "For the most part, the premiere concert on Madonna's Who's That Girl tour was a success, an extravaganza of multiple videos, flashing lights and precision dancing. If the high-tech accoutrements and inferior sound system made it difficult to hear the singer, one hopes that will be refined as the tour continues across the United States. [...] As a dancer, Madonna is supreme on stage. Her trademark skip to a funky beat highlighted the constant acrobatics. One minute she was stage left, another minute stage right. She ran up a wide staircase center stage to party with her three back-up singers, then scooted down to the stage floor, swinging her hips, accompanied by other dancers." ...|$|E
500|$|Preparation for All Hope Is Gone {{began in}} 2007. Drummer Joey Jordison explained, [...] "I've {{told them to}} demo {{whatever}} they can so we've got as much material to choose from as possible." [...] In February 2008, Slipknot entered the Sound Farm Studio in Jamaica, Iowa with producer Dave Fortman. All Hope Is Gone is the band's first album written and recorded in their home state of Iowa. Bassist Paul Gray explained that the band decided to record in Iowa because {{there were too many}} distractions in Los Angeles, where production of their previous albums had taken place. The band also stated that being close to home was good for their mindset; vocalist Corey Taylor drove home every night to see his son. Unlike Slipknot's previous releases, the album's writing process involved all nine band members, who wrote over 30songs. Jordison commented, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the band is at its peak; everyone—I mean everyone—is now completely involved in the writing process, and it's a beautiful thing." [...] Taylor felt the writing process had some problems, but also noted that the creation of every Slipknot album has had conflict and that the band has come to embrace it after realizing that the conflict helps to bring out their creativity. Taylor and guitarist Jim Root paired up with Sid Wilson, performing on keyboards, and percussionist Shawn Crahan to work on [...] "oblique, arty pieces". Taylor also experimented with tracking in an old well, stating, [...] "There was this natural reverb to it that was just intense." [...] According to Crahan none of the experimental tracks made it onto the album. However, one of them, [...] "Til We Die", appears as a bonus track on the album's special edition along with [...] "Child Of Burning Time" [...] and the similarly experimental Bloodstone Mix of [...] "Vermillion Pt. 2". The track [...] "Sulfur" [...] was the first combined effort of Jordison and Root, who wrote the song in one evening.|$|E

[...] In June 1993 the Chairman of the Scientific Committee, Dr Philip Hammond, resigned in protest to what he saw as contempt of the Scientific Committee's recommendations.
