25|$|On 18 May 2016, Microsoft Mobile {{sold its}} Nokia-branded <b>feature</b> <b>phone</b> {{business}} to HMD Global, {{a new company}} founded by former Nokia executive Jean-Francois Baril, and an associated factory in Vietnam to Foxconn's FIH Mobile subsidiary. Nokia subsequently entered into a long-term licensing deal to make HMD the exclusive manufacturer of Nokia-branded phones and tablets outside of Japan, operating in conjunction with Foxconn. The deal also granted HMD the right to essential patents and <b>feature</b> <b>phone</b> software. HMD subsequently announced the Android-based Nokia 6 smartphone in January 2017. At Mobile World Congress, HMD additionally unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, {{as well as a}} re-imagining of Nokia's classic 3310 <b>feature</b> <b>phone.</b> While Nokia has no investment in the company they do have some input in the new devices.|$|E

50|$|Over the years, Samsung Electronics was {{the main}} {{manufacturer}} for Solo Mobile's devices, and is currently the exclusive supplier of Solo <b>feature</b> <b>phones</b> and smartphones. They have manufactured twenty Solo devices: seventeen <b>feature</b> <b>phones</b> in the past, plus three Android smartphones, two which are currently available. Another notable manufacturer is Motorola Mobility, who has manufactured fourteen types of <b>feature</b> <b>phones</b> prior to Solo's renaissance.|$|R
5000|$|There {{has been}} an {{industry}} shift from <b>feature</b> <b>phones</b> (including low-end smartphones), which rely mainly on volume, to high-end flagship smartphones which also enjoy higher margins, thus high-end smartphones are much more lucrative for manufacturers than <b>feature</b> <b>phones.</b> For instance Apple Inc.'s operating margins from the iPhone remain high since these devices have always been sold to carriers at a high enough cost which compels carriers to get wireless customers to sign multiyear contracts. The shift away from <b>feature</b> <b>phones</b> has forced wireless carriers to increase subsidies of handsets, and the high selling prices of flagship smartphones have had {{a negative effect on}} the wireless carriers (AT&T Mobility, Verizon, and Sprint) who have seen their EBITDA service margins drop as they sold more smartphones and fewer <b>feature</b> <b>phones.</b> Trends have shown that consumers are willing to pay more for smartphones that deliver more features/applications such as 4G LTE and touchscreens, and smartphones have become a part of North American pop culture (while <b>feature</b> <b>phones</b> are no longer [...] "cool"). Though smartphones cost more to produce they deliver high profit margins than <b>feature</b> <b>phones,</b> thus device makers and wireless carriers have shifted towards smartphones.http://www.eweek.com/mobile/slideshows/smartphones-sales-finally-overtake-feature-phones-10-reasons-why/ ...|$|R

Opera Mini will become the default web browser for Microsoft’s existing <b>feature</b> <b>phone</b> and Asha product lines that Microsoft acquired from Nokia; this could put Opera Mini on another 100 million phones a year.

25|$|MediaTek's {{financial}} {{results have been}} subject to variation as the financial success of different product lines fluctuated. MediaTek's relatively strong sales in 2009/2010 was based on its strong market position for <b>feature</b> <b>phone</b> chipsets. Smartphone and tablet solutions contributed to MediaTek's sales and income increase in 2013, while revenue recognition from the acquisition of MStar Semiconductor, which became effective in February 2014, as well as a continuing strong position for smartphone and tablet solutions, are the main reasons for the sales growth seen in 2014.|$|E
25|$|The same month, Microsoft {{sold its}} Nokia <b>feature</b> <b>phone</b> {{business}} to HMD Global, a Finnish startup backed by former Nokia executives. The Foxconn subsidiary FIH Mobile acquired {{a factory in}} Vietnam, {{as well as other}} distribution and manufacturing assets, from Microsoft Mobile as well. HMD and FIH announced that they would collaborate on developing and manufacturing new devices under the Nokia trademark (having reached a new 10-year license for the brand, and the Android-based Nokia 6 smartphone as its first device), with input from Nokia on design and incorporation of its technologies.|$|E

25|$|To {{compete in}} {{developing}} markets, Microsoft launched various low- and mid-range devices—such as the Lumia 430 Dual SIM, 532, 435, 640, 640 XL, and 540 Dual SIM—to boost Windows Phone sales and increase market share. In Q2 2015, Lumia sold 10.5 million devices, compared to 8.2 {{million during the}} same quarter in the prior year. As {{a consequence of the}} Microsoft Lumia 535 being as popular as its predecessor, the Nokia Lumia 520, in key markets such as India and Brazil, Microsoft would not concentrate on releasing a high end Microsoft Lumia device until the launch of Windows 10. In Q2 2015, <b>feature</b> <b>phone</b> sales declined year-over-year, with a total of 40 million being sold for a total revenue of $2.28 billion, and a gross margin of $330 million (14%), being significantly lower than previous years due to a global decline in the demand for feature phones in favour of smartphones.|$|E

The rest of the chapters were released approximately once a month since then till August 8, 2011 for iMode and November 10, 2011 for EZweb. On Tokyo Game Show of 2011, the game was announced to be released on iOS and Android with improved graphics and sound, and support for slide-pad controls over the <b>feature</b> <b>phone</b> version. On E3 2012, the iOS/Android version was announced internationally as Final Fantasy Dimensions also to be released on August 31, 2012. Due to technical difficulties, only [...] "Prologue" [...] was released first for the iOS version. All other chapters were purchasable at the in-app shop after upgrading from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 which was available later in the same day.

However, it competed with other {{mid-range}} devices which slotted right below flagship phones, like the HTC One Mini and Moto X. Given Apple's premium pricing tendencies, the iPhone 5C was initially sold at prices similar to other high-end flagship smartphones released early in 2013 (and receiving discounts after being {{on the market for}} six months) such as the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One. Like previous iPhones, it did not compete in the <b>feature</b> <b>phone</b> segment nor the unsubsidized/prepaid category.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the turn}} of the decade, iOS and Android, {{together}} with less-common platforms such as BlackBerry 10 and Windows Phone, had shifted the smartphone focus from being a niche to mass market consumers. <b>Feature</b> <b>phones</b> were primarily designed as communication devices, and manufacturers had, up to that point, been enjoying record sales of cell phones based more on fashion and brand, rather than technological innovation. [...] Though smartphones cost more to produce, they were delivering higher profit margins than <b>feature</b> <b>phones,</b> leading to manufacturers and wireless carriers shifting towards smartphones.http://www.eweek.com/mobile/slideshows/smartphones-sales-finally-overtake-feature-phones-10-reasons-why/ As a result, smartphones now have the largest selection and advertising among carriers, which devoted less and less store space and marketing to <b>feature</b> <b>phones.</b> In 2013, smartphones outsold <b>feature</b> <b>phones</b> for the first time, accounting for 51.8% of mobile phone sales {{in the second quarter of}} that year.|$|R

In May 2016, Microsoft gutted its mobile business, selling the Nokia <b>feature</b> <b>phone</b> line and trademark rights to the Finnish startup HMD Global (who announced a partnership with Foxconn, which had also acquired supply chain assets from Microsoft, to manufacture Nokia-branded feature phones and smartphones), and announcing that it planned to cut up to 1,350 positions in Finland and focus on offering its productivity services on competing mobile platforms. In 2017, Microsoft executive Joe Belfiore revealed that Microsoft had ceased {{the development of new}} Windows phones or new features for Windows 10 Mobile, citing the losses in market share and lack of app development.|$|E
2500|$|Microsoft had {{established}} a major partnership with Nokia in 2011, in which the company exclusively produced smartphones using the Windows Phone platform, and promoted Microsoft services on its <b>feature</b> <b>phone</b> products (including Bing search). Microsoft also licensed Nokia Maps data for its own mapping services. While Nokia's resultant Lumia range had the largest market share out of all Windows Phone vendors, Nokia's overall market share was falling rapidly due to competition from other major smartphone vendors. In September 2013, Microsoft announced its acquisition of Nokia's devices and services businesses in a deal valued at €5.4 billion, which closed in April 2014 {{with the formation of}} a Finnish subsidiary, Microsoft Mobile. Nokia's then-CEO, Stephen Elop, joined Microsoft as president of its Devices division following the acquisition.
