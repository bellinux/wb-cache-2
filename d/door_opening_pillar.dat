As with the other buildings of the site, the outer stonework and plastering has been lost. The nimja are long rectangular structures located beside the plazas upon [...] high platforms. Upon these platforms, the palaces generally consisted of two levels, a lower roofed antechamber with a second, higher level supporting the main rooms of the structure. Some of the larger palaces had several stairways giving access to the antechamber, and multiple <b>doors</b> and <b>pillars</b> <b>opening</b> into the rooms of main building.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} is to investigate the stresses around the <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> for the load cases that creates highest stresses. The influence of different material thicknesses at the tower lower parts. It investigates the lower tower section which includes the <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> which is used for service and maintenance inside the tower. The loading of the tower generates the stresses around the <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> and these stresses will analyze for static analysis using the FEM software ANSYS 14. 5. As there is more probability of having crack near the <b>door</b> <b>opening.</b> To investigate the influence on the stress level and ultimate load of the tower, the tower shell thickness around the <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> varied in simulation. There are total six models prepared in the paper among which two models are prepared with uniform thickness of 38 mm, two models are prepared with 38 mm thickness at the base and 15 mm {{at the top and}} two models are prepared with 70 mm thickness at the base and 15 mm at the top.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> rates on air quality in the operation room during hip revision surgery by measuring the number of colony forming units per cubic meter (CFU/m(3)). METHODS: During 70 hip revision operations the number of CFU/m(3) was measured at four time points. Factors that may influence air quality were recorded, including the number of persons present, duration of surgery, and <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> rates. The measured CFU/m(3) was dichotomized as either acceptable ( 20 CFU/m(3)). To determine whether <b>door</b> <b>openings</b> were associated with CFU/m(3) values, we used generalized linear mixed models to model the dichotomized repeatedly measured CFU/m(3) values. RESULTS: The median number of <b>door</b> <b>openings</b> per operation was eight (range, 0 - 72), the median duration of surgery was 145 min (range, 60 - 285), and the median number of persons present during surgery was eight (range, 5 - 10). Adjusted for number of persons in the operation room and duration of surgery, the number of <b>door</b> <b>openings</b> per operation was associated (odds ratio [OR] 1. 05 [95 % confidence interval {CI} 1. 02 - 1. 09]; p = 0. 003) with an unacceptable number of CFU/m(3). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a substantial association between number of <b>door</b> <b>openings</b> and an unacceptable number (> 20) of CFU/m(3) was found. Adjusted for number of persons in the operation room and duration of surgery, every <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> increased the odds of unacceptable CFU/m(3) values by 5 %. Number of persons present during surgery and duration of surgery were not related to CFU/m(3) ...|$|R

40|$|Refrigerator-freezers energy {{consumption}} is greatly affected by room temperature, <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> and thermostat setting position. Two frost free household refrigerator freezers {{of the same}} capacity were tested in the laboratory to determine the sensitivity of their {{energy consumption}} to various usage conditions. The experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of single variables, such as temperature, thermostat setting positions and <b>door</b> <b>opening,</b> and their combined effect on energy consumption. Our investigation reveals that room temperature has the higher effect on energy consumption, followed by <b>door</b> <b>opening.</b> Thermostat setting position has the lower effect on energy consumption.

40|$|In this paper, a {{study of}} {{resistance}} of a lower part of a wind tower including a <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> is presented. Nonlinear 3 -D shell element models with real geometry of lower tower segment {{have been used to}} simulate the thin walled shell structure in order to study the influence of <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> on the strength of the tower. Two possible alternatives for strengthening the <b>door</b> <b>openings</b> were considered: (i) increasing thicknesses of plate around the opening and (ii) stiffening the opening by a stiffener. Buckling analysis and nonlinear analysis were performed to obtain critical buckling modes and strength of the tower segment. Nominal material properties of different steel grades were considered to investigate possibility of using higher strength steels. A parametric study considering possible local shell imperfections according to EN 1993 - 1 - 6 has been considered.

Profiled steel sheeting connected to dry board using self-drilling or self-tapping screw to form a composite section forms this system. This study reviews the Profiled Steel Sheeting Dry Board (PSSDB) system as wall panel, which has <b>door</b> and window <b>opening.</b> The material of profiled steel sheet is PEVA 45 and the dry board is CEMBOARD.

40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> on cave carbon dioxide (CO 2) levels was {{studied in the}} Entrance Chamber and the Gallery Chamber of the Balcarka Cave (Moravian Karst, Czech Republic). The effect of <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> {{differed}} with cave ventilation modes. Under upward airflow mode, the cave <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> led to the increase of output advective CO 2 fluxes from the cave and to the decrease of CO 2 levels. This effect was evident especially in the Entrance Chamber near the cave entrance and then suppressed in the Gallery Chamber situated deeper in the cave. Under the downward airflow mode, the cave <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> changed airflow paths and main CO 2 sources/fluxes. This resulted in the increase of CO 2 level in the Entrance Chamber while the levels in the Gallery Chamber decrease. Modeling indicates that the increase could be result of input advective CO 2 fluxes from epikarst (up to 5. 9 × 10 - 2 mol s- 1). To reduce the impact on cave microclimate, a careful control of the visiting regime without overlapping of individual doors’ openings is recommended...|$|R
