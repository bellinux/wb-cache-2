Carter would later return to Hawaii for a ten-day stint in 1997 to begin <b>fleshing</b> out the finished script.

25|$|Part of Brooks's appeal as a {{financial}} journalist was that he wrote for a general-interest publication, The New Yorker.

They had it self-published by the family publishing company, Paolini International, and Paolini then travelled to various schools advertising his novel.

25|$|Producer Peter Jackson {{planned to}} produce a film {{adaptation}} based on the Halo video-game franchise with first-time director Neill Blomkamp. Due {{to a lack of}} financing, the Halo adaptation was placed on hold. Jackson and Blomkamp discussed pursuing alternative projects and eventually chose {{to produce a}}nd direct, respectively, District 9. Blomkamp had previously directed commercials and short films, but District 9 was his first feature film. The director co-wrote the script with Terri Tatchell and chose to film in South Africa, where he was born. In District 9, Tatchell and Blomkamp returned to the world explored in his short film Alive in Joburg, choosing characters, moments and concepts that they found interesting including the documentary style filmmaking, staged interviews, alien designs, alien technology/mecha suits, and the parallels to racial conflict and segregation in South Africa, and <b>fleshing</b> out these elements for the feature film.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Chilling injury (CI) {{is a major}} physiolog-ical problem {{limiting}} {{consumption and}} export of peach and nectarine (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch). To clarify the genetic basis for chilling injury, inheritance of the major CI symptoms mealiness, <b>flesh</b> browning, <b>flesh</b> bleeding, and <b>flesh</b> leatheriness were examined over three years in two related peach progenies. In addition, genetic relationships among traits and the year-to-year variation in trait performance in these progenies were tracked. Both populations also segregated for Free-stone-Melting <b>flesh</b> (F-M) and yellow <b>flesh.</b> There were significant differences in CI symptoms among years. The major gene endoPG, which controls the F-M locus, provides resistance to mealiness in non-melting <b>flesh</b> fruit. Only fruit with melting <b>flesh</b> can develop mealiness if the tree possesses other genetic susceptibility factors and/or experiences inducing conditions. The F-M locus also greatly influences susceptibility to <b>flesh</b> bleeding, although the physio-logical mechanism for this disorder is unclear and may be controlled by a different gene closely linked to endoPG. Unlike mealiness, <b>flesh</b> bleeding occurred primarily in non-melting <b>flesh</b> fruit, particularly when the fruit is white-fleshed. <b>Flesh</b> browning incidence was greater in mealy fruit and {{was not associated with}} <b>flesh</b> bleeding. Breeding for CI resistance is thus a viable long-term strategy to reduce losses in the fresh and processed peach and nectarine industries. This study is an important first step to understanding genetic control of CI symptoms in peach...|$|R

25|$|Though Broadchurch {{was first}} {{conceived}} of in 2003, creator and writer Chris Chibnall first began <b>fleshing</b> {{out the story}} and writing scripts for the first episodes in 2011. He approached ITV in autumn 2011 with the series, and the network quickly approved it for production. The role of Reverend Paul Coates was written for Arthur Darvill, and leads David Tennant and Olivia Colman were the first cast. Other roles were cast using auditions. Principal photography began on 13 August 2012 in Dorset. Most scenes were shot on location, {{with the majority of}} filming in and around Clevedon and West Bay. Soundstages were used for some interior scenes. Dialogue rarely departed from the scripts, but other aspects of the performances were improvised. A documentary visual style and an emphasis on first takes were used to heighten the realism of the series and acting. Few of the crew and none of the actors knew the identity of the murderer when filming began. A number of steps were taken to maintain this secret. Only those cast and crew with an absolute need to know were told the identity of the murderer once filming began on the final three episodes.|$|E

Molecular markers were identified in both F 2 populations and all significant, associated markers from ?TAM Uvalde? were linked with WF. A single QTL was also found to be linked with the WF locus.
