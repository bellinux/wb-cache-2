50|$|A major {{long-term}} {{problem has}} been the failure of justice arising from structural delays in the justice system: in 1990 the average court received 675 new cases, and reached decisions on 120. In Caracas the average court took 286 days to complete the investigation phase of trials, against the legal maximum of 34; and 794 days to reach the sentencing phase, against the legal maximum of 68. As {{a result of the}} <b>judicial</b> <b>backlog,</b> many prisoners eventually convicted will have spent longer in detention at the time of sentencing than the maximum sentence permitted for their crimes. The backlog also contributes significantly to the overcrowding of Venezuela's prisons.|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of forms of negotiated justice in Italy required harmonization with the constitutional principles of criminal law and procedure. As far as plea bargaining is concerned, particularly problematic {{are the issues}} of the assessment of the defendant’s responsibility, {{of the role of the}} judge and of the determination of the punishment. With regard to the abbreviated trial, the main constitutional concern is that it has become an almost inquisitorial proceeding. From a practical point of view, statistical data show a limited use of plea bargaining and abbreviated trial, which are unable to solve <b>judicial</b> <b>backlog</b> problems...|$|E
40|$|Reform {{proposals}} {{with regard}} to the judiciary tend to focus on improving its internal functioning and often overlook the distribution of powers between the centralized and decentralized government level. Nevertheless, an inefficient distribution of powers may cause conflicts of jurisdiction, <b>judicial</b> <b>backlog,</b> and legal uncertainty. As a result, the constitutional distribution of powers {{plays an important role in}} federal countries. In addition to satisfying the demands of the litigants, there is usually an ongoing quest for finding an acceptable balance of powers between the federal and state level. This presentation examines how four federal countries have struck a balance so far, respectively the U. S., Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium...|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} made no discernible progress in prosecuting, convicting, and sentencing human trafficking offenders in Guyana during the reporting period. The Combating Trafficking of Persons Act of 2005 prohibits {{all forms of}} trafficking and prescribes sufficiently stringent penalties, ranging from three years to life imprisonment, and which are commensurate with those for rape. The government reported four new trafficking investigations during the reporting period, none of which led to prosecutions. The government’s four prosecutions from previous reporting periods remained ongoing, with no significant progress. To date, {{the government has not}} convicted any trafficking offenders. Progress on the prosecution of criminal cases is perpetually delayed by <b>judicial</b> <b>backlogs,</b> incorrectly filed paperwork or the failure of key parties to appear at hearings. NGOs and one government official expressed concern that trafficking-related official complicity was a problem. It is reportedly common for defendants to bribe court officials for favorable rulings. The Ministry of Home Affairs conducted two anti-trafficking training programs, one in partnership with IOM, for 120 police, prosecutors, and investigators during the reporting period.|$|R
50|$|The Conference {{has studied}} and issued policy {{statements}} on matters {{pertaining to the}} state judiciary, including habeas corpus, federal funding for state courts, the State Justice Institute, <b>judicial</b> immunity, court <b>backlogs,</b> {{cameras in the courtroom}} and child support enforcement.|$|R
5000|$|Prisons in Latin America {{are among}} the most {{dangerous}} in the world, and the ones in Bolivia are the second most overcrowded at 233% overcapacity (just behind El Salvador, with 299%). The driving factors in overcrowding are pre-trial detentions and <b>judicial</b> <b>backlogs.</b> At least 85% of the inmates in the country have pending trials/convictions. Many are imprisoned for minor drug offenses under Law 1008, a controversial legislation created in 1988 that places heavy penalties on drug offenders. In addition, prisons in Latin America are often run by inmates affiliated with a criminal group. The gang leaders, known as [...] "delegates", may charge fees to other inmates in exchange for certain benefits, such as occupying personal cells, enjoying family visits, or having televisions. Prisons in Bolivia may have so-called [...] "life insurance" [...] fees, mandatory extortion payments among inmates that range from $100 to $500. The fees are controlled by prison gangs, and those who fail to pay may face torture or death. Egregious as these abuses are, as of 2013, organized crime activities in Bolivia's penitentiary system are not at the levels of influence observed in most prisons of Central America, Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, where a significant proportion of outside organized crime is commanded from inside prisons.|$|R
40|$|This article first {{explains}} {{the nature of}} the Belgian <b>judicial</b> <b>backlog,</b> and relates this backlog to the ECtHR's jurisprudence regarding article 6, § 1 ECnHR. The second chapter discusses the ECtHR's Kudla-jurisprudence, based on article 13 ECnHR, which requests member states to provide, within their legal order, for effective means to challenge judicial delay in a specific case. In the third chapter, the Belgian compliance with this jurisprudence is examined. Three current procedures are examined {{in the light of the}} Kudla-jurisprudence: the right to damages from the government, the Court of Cassation's withdrawing the case from the judge, and the sentence reduction in criminal law. Since none of these procedures satisfies the Kudla-demands, the last chapter proposes a procedure de lege ferenda in order to fulfill the obligations the Strasbourg Court imposes. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The Portuguese {{judicial}} system has attracted considerable criticism {{in recent years}} and demands for reforms have gained prominence. By using the Data Envelopment Analysis technique and focusing on the performance of 223 Portuguese first instance courts during the period of 2007 to 2011, this research has found evidence that supports some of this criticism and justifies the calls for reforms, better performance and accountability of the {{judicial system}}. In particular, our results found a sector with considerable scope for improvement with less than 16 percent of the 223 courts analysed making an efficient use of their resources in each year and with only one third of the courts being considered efficient in {{at least one of the}} five years assessed. Whilst the results suggest that improvement can be achieved with better case management, scale factors also seem to play an important role in explaining inefficiency, with most of the inefficient courts being smaller than optimal and with smaller courts being, on average, less efficient than larger ones. The existence of a statistically significant relationship between courts’ efficiency and size was confirmed by the Mann-Whitney test. These results indicate considerable scope for improvement and that some of the planned reforms are timely and seem well targeted. However, the results also suggest that efficiency increases matching peers’ best practices are not enough to sustainably reduce the prevailing <b>judicial</b> <b>backlog</b> and length of court proceedings in a considerable number of courts. Major changes in the capacity and/or functioning of the Portuguese judicial system might also be required...|$|E
