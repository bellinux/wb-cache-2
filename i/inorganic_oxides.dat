5000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{anaerobic}} organism that are involved in the process of anaerobic digestion including acetic acid-forming bacteria (acetogens) and methane-forming (methanogens). These organisms feed upon the initial feedstock, which undergoes a number of different processes converting it to intermediate molecules including sugars, hydrogen, and acetic acid, before finally being converted to biogas.Different species of bacteria are able to survive at different temperature ranges. Ones living optimally at temperatures between 35-40 °C are called mesophiles or mesophilic bacteria.

We have functionally mimicked the hierarchical silica exoskeletons of diatoms, where specialized proteins chaperone the condensation of silicic acid into nanoscale silica networks confined by microscopic vesicle walls. We replaced the proteins with functionally analogous polyamines and vesicles with lithographically defined polymer templates. We grafted the polyamines either to the surface or throughout the template by changing the template chemistry and altering our grafting strategy. Exposure to an <b>inorganic</b> <b>oxide</b> precursor solution led to electrostatic aggregation at the polyamine chains, catalyzing hydrolysis and condensation to form long-range <b>inorganic</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticle networks. Grafted to epoxy surfaces, swelling effects and the hyperbranched brush morphology lead {{to the formation of}} nanofruit features that generated thin, conformal inorganic coatings. When the polyamines were grafted throughout hydrogel templates, we obtained composite networks that yielded faithful inorganic replicas of the original patterns. By varying the polyamine chain length and combustion parameters, we controlled the nanoparticle size, morphology, and crystalline phase. The polyamine morphology affected the resulting inorganic network in both fabrication schemes and we could control the depostion over multiple length scales. Because our methods were compatible with a variety of lithographic methods, we were able to generate inorganic replicas of 1 D, 2 D, and 3 D polymer structures.

The purpose of my internship here at Glenn Research Center is to make dual purpose materials; materials that in addition to being lightweight have electronic, photophysical and magnetic properties and, therefore, act as electronic components and sensors as well as structural components. One type of ultra lightweight material of great interest is aerogels, which have densities ranging from 0. 003 g/cc to 0. 8 g/cc. However, aerogels are extremely fragile and, as a result, have limited practical applications. Recently, Glenn Research Center has developed a process of nano-casting polymers onto the inorganic network of silica-based aerogels increasing the strength 300 fold while only increasing the density 3 fold. By combining the process of nano-casting polymers with <b>inorganic</b> <b>oxide</b> networks other than silica, we are actively pursuing lightweight dual purpose materials.

The development of agents or surface coatings with antimicrobial activity has gained increasing interest in recent years. Compared with organic antimicrobial agents such as quaternary ammonium salt and chlorine disinfectant, <b>inorganic</b> <b>oxides</b> have the advantages of robustness, long shelf life, high stability at higher temperatures or pressures, {{and the ability to}} withstand harsh processes. This has attracted much more focus on developing alternative <b>inorganic</b> <b>oxides</b> to substitute for the conventional organic compounds. Coatings are expected to be both stable and safe. Inorganic materials with antibacterial properties have been used as antimicrobial coatings on various devices to eliminate microorganisms on surfaces in the environment, community, and health care settings to help stop the spread of the diseases [1 – 4]. Among the <b>inorganic</b> <b>oxides,</b> zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium dioxide (TiO 2), magnesium oxide (MgO), and calcium oxide (CaO) are not only stable under harsh conditions but also regarded as safe materials for humans and animals [3, 5 – 7]. Moreover, TiO 2 and ZnO have been used in the formulations of various personal care products. Interestingly, ZnO shows antimicrobial activity without photoactivation, in contrast to TiO 2, which requires photoactivation [5, 8 – 12]. Due to their small size (1 – 100  nm) and novel structures, ZnO nanoparticles exhibit significantly improved physical, chemical, and biological properties compared with bulk ZnO. ZnO nanoparticles are a multifunctional material with good catalytic, electrical, photochemical, and optical properties. They are suitable for a broad range of applications such as semiconductors, piezoelectric devices, field emission displays, gas sensors, biosensors, UV-shielding materials, photocatalytic degradation of pollutants, and antimicrobial treatments [1 – 4].|$|E
40|$|Man-made {{vitreous}} fibre (MMVF) is {{a generic}} name {{used to describe}} an inorganic fibrous material manufactured primarily from glass, rock, minerals, slag and processed <b>inorganic</b> <b>oxides.</b> The MMVFs produced are non-crystalline (glassy, vitreous, amorphous). Other names for MMVFs include manufactured vitreous fibres, man-made mineral fibres (MMMF), machine-made mineral fibres and synthetic vitreous fibres. Continuous glass filament is sometimes {{also referred to as}} ‘glass textile fibre’. The term ‘mineral wool ’ has been used in the USA to describe only rock (stone) wool and slag wool. In Europe, ‘mineral wool ’ also includes glass wool. In this monograph, the terms rock (stone) wool, slag wool and glass wool are used rather than mineral wool, whenever possible. Man-made vitreous fibres are manufactured by a variety of processes based on the attenuation of a thin stream of molten <b>inorganic</b> <b>oxides</b> at high temperatures. All commercially important MMVFs are silica-based and contain various amounts of other <b>inorganic</b> <b>oxides.</b> The non-silica components typically include, but are not limited to, oxides of alkaline earths, alkalis, aluminium, boron, iron and zirconium. These additional oxides may be constituents of the raw materials used to make the fibres, or they may be added to enhance the manufacturing process or the product performance. Depending on the process of fibre formation, MMVFs are produced either as wool, which is a mass of tangled, discontinuous fibres of variable lengths and diameters, or as filaments, which are continuous fibres (of indeterminate length) with diameters having ranges that are more uniform and typically thicker than those of wool.
