6000|$|The quick blood <b>flushed</b> <b>over</b> the pale, {{transparent}} face as {{a virgin}} glacier flushes at sunrise, {{and she looked}} up eagerly. [...] "Come!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wasn't it Voltaire who quarreled with a king over candle-ends?" [...] Graham queried, pleasuring in {{the sight}} of her graceful abandon. Thirty-eight! It was impossible. She seemed almost a girl, petulant and <b>flushed</b> <b>over</b> some school task. Then he remembered Mrs. Tully's remark that Paula was the most mature child she had ever known.|$|E
60|$|She sprang {{away from}} the friend who would have {{protected}} her:—“Hath he left me?” says she. “We had words this morning: he was very gloomy, and I angered him: but he dared not, he dared not!” As she spoke a burning blush <b>flushed</b> <b>over</b> her whole face and bosom. Esmond saw it reflected in the glass by which she stood, with clenched hands, pressing her swelling heart.|$|E

6000|$|... "Great God! {{what do you}} mean?" [...] said Will, <b>flushing</b> <b>over</b> {{face and}} ears, his {{features}} seeming to change {{as if he had}} had a violent shake. [...] "Don't joke; tell me what you mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{should have}} seen the astonishment of Lauda Latymer, the Archbishop of Croydon's daughter, as she was passing St. Bennet's, Knightsbridge, and as she fancied she {{recognized}} in the man who was crying old clothes the gentleman with whom she had talked at the Count de St. Aulair's the night before." [...] Something like a blush <b>flushed</b> <b>over</b> the pale features of Mendoza as he mentioned the Lady Lauda's name. [...] "Come on," [...] said he. They passed through various warehouses--the orange room, the sealing-wax room, the six-bladed knife department, and finally came to an old baize door. Rafael opened the baize door by some secret contrivance, and they were in a black passage, with a curtain at the end.|$|E
6000|$|No word {{spoke the}} deliverer. But the Marchesa! She will now receive her child--she will press {{it to her}} heart--she will cling to its little form, and smother it with her caresses. Alas! another's arms have taken it from the stranger--another's arms have taken it away, and borne it afar off, unnoticed, into the palace! And the Marchesa! Her lip--her {{beautiful}} lip trembles: tears are gathering in her eyes--those eyes which, like Pliny's acanthus, are [...] "soft and almost liquid." [...] Yes! tears are gathering in those eyes--and see! the entire woman thrills throughout the soul, and the statue has started into life! The pallor of the marble countenance, the swelling of the marble bosom, the very purity of the marble feet, we behold suddenly <b>flushed</b> <b>over</b> with a tide of ungovernable crimson; and a slight shudder quivers about her delicate frame, as a gentle air at Napoli about the rich silver lilies in the grass.|$|E
60|$|I {{sat down}} among the heather with my chin on my hand, turning the thing {{over in my}} mind, and {{watching}} him in his old brown clothes, {{with the end of}} a grey plaid flapping over his shoulder, as he picked his way up the swell of the hill. It was a poor life this, at West Inch, waiting to fill my father's shoes, with the same heath, and the same burn, and the same sheep, and the same grey house for ever before me. But over there, over the blue sea, ah! there was a life fit for a man. There was the Major, a man past his prime, wounded and spent, and yet planning to get to work again, whilst I, with all the strength of my youth, was wasting it upon these hillsides. A hot wave of shame <b>flushed</b> <b>over</b> me, and I sprang up all in a tingle to be off and playing a man's part in the world.|$|E

6000|$|Dr. J. Crichton Browne {{has given}} me so {{striking}} an account of intense fear in an insane woman, aged thirty-five, that the description though painful {{ought not to be}} omitted. When a paroxysm seizes her, she screams out, [...] "This is hell!" [...] "There is a black woman!" [...] "I can't get out!"--and other such exclamations. When thus screaming, her movements are those of alternate tension and tremor. For one instant she clenches her hands, holds her arms out before her in a stiff semi-flexed position; then suddenly bends her body forwards, sways rapidly to and fro, draws her fingers through her hair, clutches at her neck, and tries to tear off her clothes. The sterno-cleido-mastoid muscles (which serve to bend the head on the chest) stand out prominently, as if swollen, and the skin in front of them is much wrinkled. Her hair, which is cut short {{at the back of her}} head, and is smooth when she is calm, now stands on end; that in front being dishevelled by the movements of her hands. The countenance expresses great mental agony. The skin is <b>flushed</b> <b>over</b> the face and neck, down to the clavicles, and the veins of the forehead and neck stand out like thick cords. The lower lip drops, and is somewhat everted. The mouth is kept half open, with the lower jaw projecting. The cheeks are hollow and deeply furrowed in curved lines running from the wings of the nostrils to the corners of the mouth. The nostrils themselves are raised and extended. The eyes are widely opened, and beneath them the skin appears swollen; the pupils are large. The forehead is wrinkled transversely in many folds, and at the inner extremities of the eyebrows it is strongly furrowed in diverging lines, produced by the powerful and persistent contraction of the corrugators.|$|E
30|$|Quartz crystal {{microbalance}} with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D E 4, Q-Sense, Sweden) was {{to evaluate}} the adsorption from aqueous laccase mixture suspension on silica coated QCM-D sensors. The flow rate was 100  µL/min and the temperature was maintained constant at 25  °C. The sensors were mounted in the flow modules and the system was equilibrated with buffer for 30  min to generate a stable baseline. Then, the aqueous laccase mixture suspension was <b>flushed</b> <b>over</b> the silica crystals. The changes in the frequency (f), related to the attached mass (including coupled water), and the changes in dissipation (D), related to the frictional (viscous) properties of the adsorbed laccase layer, were recorded using QSoft™ control software (Q-Sense, Sweden). More details of the experimental procedure was described by Corrales et al. [30].|$|E
40|$|The {{parts of}} an {{electrical}} contact device are treated by sputter etching {{to remove the}} parent metal oxide. Prior to exposure of the electrodes to any oxygen, a sacrificial metal is sputter deposited on the parts. Preferably this sacrificial metal is one that oxidizes slowly and is readily dissolved by the liquid metal. The sacrificial metal may then be removed from unwanted areas. The remainder of the ring and the probe to be wet by the liquid metal are submerged in the liquid metal or the liquid metal is <b>flushed</b> <b>over</b> these areas, preferably while they are being slightly abraded, unitl all the sacrificial material on these portions is wet by the liquid metal. In doing so the liquid metal dissolves the sacrificial metal and permanently wets the parent metal. Preferred materials used {{in the process and}} for the electrodes of electrical contact devices are high purity (99. 0 %) nickel or AISI type 304 stainless steel for the electrical contact devices, gallium as the liquid metal, and gold as the sacrificial material...|$|E

40|$|Introduction : {{there is}} always {{concerns}} regarding postoperative bleeding in Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) patients; {{a number of different}} strategies have been used to compensate for it and {{to reduce the amount of}} blood transfusion. We designed this study to see if local fibrinogen could decrease postoperative bleeding in adult CABG, which is not studied yet. Materials and methods : in a double blind clinical trial, after matching the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 50 patients entered the study. Pre- and postoperative data, including clinical and laboratory variables were assessed. Among them, pre- and postoperative fibrinogen levels were measured. One group received 1 g fibrinogen as 50 mL solution <b>flushed</b> <b>over</b> the epicardium before sternal closure; the other received 50 mL normal saline as placebo in the same method. Results : no difference between the two groups regarding preoperative and postoperative fibrinogen levels. Also, two groups were the same regarding PT, PTT, INR and platelet. However, bleeding was less and hematocrit level was higher in local fibrinogen group. Conclusion : local fibrinogen could decrease postoperative bleeding in CABG patients leading to decreased need for blood transfusion. Key words: fibrinogen; coronary artery bypass graft; postoperative bleedin...|$|E
40|$|The bottom {{boundary}} layer above sloping topography {{can be highly}} turbulent, even in deep seas. This is demonstrated here using high-resolution 1 -Hz sampling temperature sensors that were moored for 5 months every 0. 5 m between 6. 5 and 61 m above a 572 m deep seafloor promontory on the continental slope off Valencia, Spain. Using these data, turbulence parameters have been estimated. With time and in the vertical, values vary over four orders of magnitude. They have a dominant local inertial period which is modulated by an about 11 day periodicity associated with variations in a baroclinic unstable boundary current. When this current is strong and Eastward, the upslope phase of inertial wave generates convective turbulence which reaches closest {{to the bottom and}} therefore can effect sediment dispersal. In late winter, equally strong shear-induced turbulence in 50 m high Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) overturns is forced by 0. 2 m s- 1 off/downslope motions, which are preceded by periods of warming of a few 0. 01 degrees C before the cooler near-bottom water is suddenly <b>flushed</b> <b>over</b> the promontory into the basin. Such anomalously large K-H overturns occurred 6 times in the investigated winter period...|$|E
30|$|Following {{the layer}} {{formation}} in situ by QCM-D, Fig.  1 shows the mass uptake {{related to the}} changes in oscillation frequency of the silica substrates related to the absorbates getting attached from the laccase—maltodextrin suspension. As described in the experimental section, firstly the pure acetate buffer solution was <b>flushed</b> <b>over</b> the crystal surface (baseline), stage I, followed by a contact-period with the laccase-maltodextrin suspension, stage II. In stage II a decrease of the frequency indicates mass adsorption. A steady state was not achieved after {{one and a half}} hours of contact with the suspension. The slow decrease in the frequency was observed {{in the early stages of}} biofilm growth on the silica substrate and, later on, on top of the already formed biofilm as suggested by the results of AFM investigations presented in the next section. Such small growth rate might be considered an indicative of a low affinity of the biopolymers for adsorption to the surface. A steady state, stage III, was not achieved during the contact time, as it will be presented in further studies by the authors. In stage IV and V the surface was flushed with the buffer for 30  min and only low desorption of the biofilm in the early stage IV was detected. The insignificant extent of desorption of the surface is related to a surprisingly stable layer formation.|$|E

40|$|Most trauma {{cases with}} rapid {{exsanguination}} to cardiac arrest (CA) in the field, {{as well as}} many cases of normovolemic sudden cardiac death are ‘unresuscitable’ by standard cardiopulmonary–cerebral resuscitation (CPCR). We are presenting a dog model for exploring pharmacological strategies for the rapid induction by aortic arch flush of suspended animation (SA), i. e. preservation of cerebral viability for 15 min or longer. This can be extended by profound hypothermic circulatory arrest of at least 60 min, induced and reversed with (portable) cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). SA is meant to buy time for transport and repair during pulselessness, to be followed by delayed resuscitation to survival without brain damage. This model with exsanguination over 5 min to CA of 15 -min no-flow, is to evaluate rapid SA induction by aortic flush of normal saline solution (NSS) at room temperature (24 °C) at 2 -min no-flow. This previously achieved normal functional recovery, but with histologic brain damage. We hypothesized that the addition of adenosine would achieve recovery with no histologic damage, because adenosine delays energy failure and helps repair brain injury. This dog model included reversal of 15 -min no-flow with closed-chest CPB, controlled ventilation to 20 h, and intensive care to 72 h. Outcome was evaluated by overall performance, neurologic deficit, and brain histologic damage. At 2 min of CA, 500 ml of NSS at 24 °C was <b>flushed</b> (<b>over</b> 1 min) into the brain and heart via an aortic balloon catheter. Controls (n= 5) received no drug. The adenosine group (n= 5) received 2 -chloro-adenosine (long acting adenosine analogue), 30 mg in the flush solution, and, after reperfusion, adenosine i. v. over 12 h (210 μg/kg per min for 3 h, 140 μg/kg per min for 9 h). The 24 °C flush reduced tympanic membrane temperature (Tty) within 2 min of CA from 37. 5 to ≈ 36. 0 °C in both groups. At 72 h, final overall performance category (OPC) 1 (normal) was achieved by all ten dogs of the two groups. Final neurologic deficit scores (NDS; 0 – 10 % normal, 100 % brain death) were 5 ± 3 % in the control group versus 6 ± 5 % in the adenosine group (NS). Total brain histologic damage scores (HDS) at 72 h were 74 ± 9 (64 – 80) in the control group versus 68 ± 19 (40 – 88) in the adenosine group (NS). In both groups, ischemic neurons were as prevalent in the basal ganglia and neocortex as in the cerebellum and hippocampus. The mild hypothermic aortic flush protocol is feasible in dogs. The adenosine strategy used does not abolish the mild histologic brain damage...|$|E
50|$|The painted dragon is a {{medium-sized}} terrestrial lizard with a short, deep head and uniform body scales. The appearance {{of this species}} is extremely variable as it can appear {{in a number of}} different colour combinations. Adult males can be brown, yellowish brown, orange to reddish brown with dark-edged pale bars, blotches or spots overlaying a dark vertebral stripe. The flanks are spotted, variegated (irregular patches/streaks), or reticulated (net-like pattern) with dark brown and dotted with scattered, pale, dark-edged spots which will sometimes be aligned perpendicular to the vertebral stripe. The limbs are variegated and the pattern on the tail is often obscure but broad dark bands at the base. Breeding males will exhibit a bright blue <b>flush</b> <b>over</b> the lower lips, throat and limbs and a bright yellow to orange <b>flush</b> <b>over</b> the anterior chest and shoulders. Adult females and juveniles are duller in colour, lacking the bright blue and yellow pigment with females being commonly found in a rusty brown colour.|$|R
