5|$|Jackson {{agreed to}} produce the soundtrack for Sega's 1994 video game Sonic the Hedgehog 3 with {{collaborators}} Brad Buxer, Bobby Brooks, Darryl Ross, Geoff Grace, Doug Grigsby, and Cirocco Jones. Jackson left the project before completion and was not credited; some sources state Jackson was dissatisfied with the Sega Genesis console's audio chip, while others suggest Sega distanced itself <b>from</b> <b>Jackson</b> following the first allegations {{of child sexual abuse}} against him.|$|E
5|$|The {{recorded}} {{conversation was}} a critical aspect of Jackson's defense against the upcoming allegation made against him. He and his supporters argue {{that he was the}} victim of a jealous father whose only goal was to extort money from the singer. In October 1994, Mary A. Fischer of GQ magazine reported it was Evan Chandler who initially accused Jackson of molesting his son, before he demanded a screenwriting deal <b>from</b> <b>Jackson</b> instead of going to the police.|$|E
5|$|A {{decade after}} the fact, during {{the second round of}} child abuse allegations, Jackson's lawyers would file a memo stating that the 1994 {{settlement}} was made without his consent. A later disclosure by the FBI of investigation documents compiled over nearly 20 years led Jackson's attorney to suggest that no evidence of molestation or sexual impropriety <b>from</b> <b>Jackson</b> toward minors existed. According to reports, the Department of Children and Family Services (Los Angeles County) investigated Jackson beginning in 1993 with the Chandler allegation and again in 2003. Reports show the LAPD and DCFS did not find credible evidence of abuse or sexual misconduct.|$|E

5|$|M-106 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan in and {{near the city of}} Jackson. M-106 travels in a southwest-to-northeast direction <b>from</b> <b>Jackson</b> to Gregory at a junction with M-36 just a few miles northwest of Hell. The highway was first designated in 1928 running north out of downtown Jackson. It connected U.S. Highway12 (US12) to the state prison and Bunkerhill Road. A pair of changes in the early 1930s resulted in the extension eastward to Gregory.

5|$|The highway {{was first}} {{designated}} on November 11, 1926, along {{a series of}} existing state highways from Lansing southward toward Toledo. In 1930, the southern end was rerouted south of Somerset in rural northwestern Lenawee County to a course that ran directly south to the Ohio state line; the remainder was renumbered US223. Starting in the 1950s, the highway was reconfigured to bypass Mason and other communities, converting US127 into a freeway <b>from</b> <b>Jackson</b> to the Lansing area by the mid-1970s. When the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) successfully petitioned the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in 1999 to remove US27 from the state, US127 was to be extended northward from Lansing to Grayling as the replacement designation. This change was made in 2002, resulting in the current configuration of the highway in Michigan. The United States Congress has designated an additional Interstate Highway, {{to be part of}} I-73, that would replace most or all of US127 through Central and Southern Michigan, but any plans by MDOT to complete this highway were cancelled in 2001.|$|E
