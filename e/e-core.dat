50|$|The company {{produces}} {{a wide range}} of weighing products. The present day product line includes industrial scales, moisture analyzers, and force gauges, and newer versions of lab and analytical balances. An up-to-date line of prescription scales and systems is available for pharmacies. Sensitivity ranges from 0.0001g for its analytical balances, 0.001g for its laboratory and prescription scales, and 0.01g for its industrial scales. Capacities range from 50.0g up to 6000.0g for the lab, analytical, prescription and industrial scales. Torbal crane scales and force gauges can go to higher capacities. The company has produced many products thatreceived industry recognition, e.g., magazine ranking or metrology society awards. The most famous was the Model EA-1 which was the first analytical balance to use electronic force substitution. The last three digits of weight were read from a digital Veeder Root dial that was linked to a precision 10 turn potentiometer. The potentiometer output voltage was converted to force coil current which caused a magnet suspended from the weigh beam to apply a linear force to bring the mechanism into a precise balance condition. Also in the balance an <b>E-Core</b> type structure was used to detect the beam position and the result was displayed on an electronic zero center null meter. The first three decades were done with digital weight loading dials. This balance, which was marketed starting in the early 1960s, is still in use in many labs around the country and they appear fairly regularly on e-bay as they are retired.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The increased use of computers and other nonlinear loads is beginning to effect the power quality of 208 / 120 V three phase four wire distribution systems. Office buildings, medical facilities and factories that employ large numbers of these nonlinear loads are experiencing excessive triplen harmonic currents flowing in the distribution systems neutrals. Primarily third harmonic, the presence of these triplen harmonic currents is tied to wiring failure, transformer overheating, and an overall decrease in distribution system efficiency. In order to determine how prolific the problem of excessive triplen harmonics is a survey of Texas A&M office buildings is undertaken. The results of this survey along with some typical current and voltage waveforms is presented. This thesis then proposes two new techniques to help deal with extensive triplen harmonic currents in neutral conductors. The first approach is a simple passive filtering technique which directs any excessive triplen harmonic currents away from the distribution transformer and back to the load. This technique employs an <b>E-core</b> shell type transformer as the primary filtering device. The efficiency of this technique is observed under balanced and unbalanced loading conditions and simulations as well as experimental results are completed in order to validate the design. The second approach is an active technique that employs the same <b>E-core</b> transformer as the passive approach. In addition to the transformer, the active approach also employs a two switch PWM controlled active filter. The closed loop control of the active filter guarantees cancellation of neutral current harmonics and drastically improves the overvall system performance by eliminating the possibility of transformer overheating due harmonics. Simulations and experimental results of the filter operation is also presented and discussed.
