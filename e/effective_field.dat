He transferred to UCF after he completed his sophomore season for the 2015–16 Michigan Wolverines. He {{is the son of}} Johnny Dawkins who became the UCF coach following the 2015–16 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Dawkins was raised in North Carolina until spending his high school years in Northern California at St. Francis High School and Palo Alto High School and a post graduate year in New England at New Hampton Prep. As a collegiate freshman for the 2014–15 Wolverines, he began the season on the bench, but became a starter when injuries plagued the team in January 2015.

Barkley was an incredibly efficient offensive force, leading the NBA in 2-point field goal percentage every season from the 1986–87 season to the 1990–91 season. He led the league in <b>effective</b> <b>field</b> goal percentage in both the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons as well, and also led the league in offensive rating in both the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons.

During his NBA career, Barkley was a constant mismatch because he possessed a set of very uncommon skills and could play in a variety of positions. He would use all facets of his game in a single play; as a scorer, he had the ability to score from the perimeter and the post, using an array of spin moves and fadeaways, or finishing a fast break with a powerful dunk. He {{was one of the most}} efficient scorers of all-time, scoring at 54.13% total field goal percentage for his season career and 51.34% total field goal shooting for his playoff career (including a career-high season average of 60% during the 1989–90 NBA season).|$|E

50|$|All {{light with}} energy {{greater than the}} band gap of the {{material}} can be absorbed, {{though there is a}} trade-off to reducing the band gap as photons absorbed with energies higher than the band gap will thermally give off its excess energy, resulting in lower voltages and power conversion efficiencies. When these materials absorb a photon, an excited state is created and confined to a molecule or a region of a polymer chain. The excited state can be regarded as an exciton, or an electron-hole pair bound together by electrostatic interactions. In photovoltaic cells, excitons are broken up into free electron-hole pairs by <b>effective</b> <b>fields.</b> The <b>effective</b> <b>fields</b> are set up by creating a heterojunction between two dissimilar materials.

In the first step of the model development, Helmholtz and Gibbs free energy relations are constructed at the lattice or domain level to quantify the relation between the field and polarization in homogeneous, single crystal compounds which exhibit uniform <b>effective</b> <b>fields.</b> The effects of material nonhomogeneities, polycrystallinity, and variable <b>effective</b> <b>fields</b> are subsequently incorporated through the assumption that certain physical parameters, including the local coercive and <b>effective</b> <b>fields,</b> are randomly distributed and hence manifestations of stochastic density functions associated with the material. Stochastic homogenization in this manner provides low-order macroscopic models with effective parameters that can be correlated with physical properties of the data. This facilitates the identification of parameters for model construction, model updating to accommodate changing operating conditions, and control design utilizing model-based inverse compensators.
