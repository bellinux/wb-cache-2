40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper was to analyse the surface {{morphology}} and optical properties of polyoxadiazoles thin films. Design/methodology/approach: A few different conducting polymers were dissolved in N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolid(in) one. Then the solutions were deposited on a glass substrate by spin coating method with a different spin rate. Changes in surface topography and optical properties were observed. A confocal laser scanning microscope CLSM Zeiss LSM 5 Exciter has been used. Photos have been taken from area of 120 x 120 microns. Findings: The analysis of images and spectra has confirmed that the quality of thin films depends upon the used polymers. It was also observed that the parameters of the spin coating method have significant effect on the morphology and the optical properties. The spin rate has got a strong impact on them. Research limitations/implications: The morphology and optical properties of polyoxadiazoles thin films has been described. This paper include description how the spin rate influence on the polymer thin films. In order to use a polymer thin film in photovoltaics or optoelectronics it must have a high <b>internal</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>density.</b> Further research of polymer thin films are recommended. Practical implications: The spin coating method allows to deposit a uniform thin films. It is important to know how the spin rate influence on the thin films properties. It is also important to find a new use for this group of material engineering in photovoltaic or optoelectronics devices. Originality/value: The good properties of thin films make them suitable for various applications. The value of this paper is defining the optimal parameters of spin-coating technology for polyoxadiazoles thin films. The results allow the choosing optimal parameters of the deposition process. Spin coating is a very good method to obtain thin films which are obligated to have the same thickness over the whole surface...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} Balassa-Samuelson effect in 9 CEECs. Using panel cointegration techniques, we find strong {{empirical}} evidence {{in favour of}} what we call the <b>internal</b> <b>transmission</b> mechanism since productivity growth in the open sector is found to bring about non-tradable inflation. However, we also shed new light {{on the fact that the}} impact of the <b>internal</b> <b>transmission</b> mechanism on overall inflation is considerably attenuated by the low share of non-tradables in the consumer price index. Furthermore, we argue that because of this and the high share of food items and regulated prices, the CPI may be misleading when analysing the Balassa-Samuelson effect. The paper also shows that the appreciation of the transition economies' real exchange rate, which has become something of a stylised fact over the last decade is only partly caused not the Balassa-Samuelson effect. Instead, we argue that a trend increase in tradable prices is behind this phenomenon. Balassa-Samuelson effect, Panel cointegration, Transition economies, EMU...|$|R

30|$|In this article, we {{improve the}} {{performance}} of CSMA in wireless ad hoc networks by introducing joint transmitter-receiver sensing and simultaneously optimizing the sensing thresholds of both the transmitter and the receiver. This protocol is denoted as CSMATXRX. Within a Poisson distributed ad hoc network, approximate analytical expressions are derived for the outage probability of CSMATXRXwith respect to the <b>transmission</b> <b>density</b> and the sensing thresholds. The optimal sensing thresholds for both the transmitter and receiver are obtained both in non-fading and fading networks, and an understanding is provided for how these optimal thresholds balance between the hidden and exposed node problems of CSMA. It is shown that using optimal sensing thresholds can provide significant performance gain for all <b>transmission</b> <b>densities.</b> Moreover, when multiple backoffs are allowed, CSMATXRX outperforms CSMARX[12], which was previously shown {{to provide the best}} performance in unslotted systems, e.g., when M= 4, this improvement is 40 %.|$|R

40|$|International audienceNumerical {{simulations}} of mechanical loadings on pyrotechnic structures require {{the determination of}} the friction coefficient between steel and explosives. Our study focuses on contact pressures of around 100 [*]MPa and sliding velocities of around 10 [*]m/s. Explosives are brittle materials which fracture when submitted to such pressures in uniaxial compression. They have therefore to be confined to avoid any fracture during the tests. A new Hopkinson bar device which simultaneously enables to confine a sample and rub it on steel has therefore been designed. This device is composed of two coaxial transmission bars. It consists in a cylindrical sample confined in a steel tube, the cylindrical sample being inserted between the incident bar and the <b>internal</b> <b>transmission</b> bar, and the confinement tube being leant against the external transmission bar. The high impedance of the external transmission bar keeps the confinement tube quasi-motionless whereas the impedance of the <b>internal</b> <b>transmission</b> bar is calculated to reach the desired pressure and the desired velocity at the tube–sample interface. Tests have been carried out with an inert material mechanically representative of explosives. The friction coefficient and the stresses at the tube–sample interface are deduced from strain measurements on the Hopkinson bars and on the external face of the confinement tube, and from an analytical model...|$|R
