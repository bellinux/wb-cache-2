2500|$|Peyton {{was further}} {{designed}} as an artist, {{in order to}} add more depth to the character and express what she cannot or {{does not want to}} say. It also complemented her romance with Lucas, as both are deep thinkers who use their skills to speak to the world. The actual artist of Peyton's works is Helen Ward. [...] "Before joining , I had already worked as a set designer, storyboard artist and illustrator for a number of films. But I still had to try out for the job," [...] she said. [...] "I think they asked a bunch of people to give their shot at a particular drawing. They were pretty specific about what they were looking for. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>my</b> work was closest. I got the job." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the songs}} {{recorded}} for the album were Parsons and Battin's [...] "Yesterday's Train", a gentle {{meditation on the}} theme of reincarnation; a cover of Lowell George and Bill Payne's [...] "Truck Stop Girl", sung by Clarence White; and a light-hearted reading of Lead Belly's [...] "Take a Whiff on Me". The album also included the Battin-penned [...] "Well Come Back Home", a heartfelt comment on the Vietnam War. Battin explained the song's genesis to author Johnny Rogan during a 1979 interview: [...] "I was personally touched by the Vietnam situation, and my feelings about it came out in that song. I had a high school friend who died out there and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>my</b> thoughts were on him at the time." [...] Battin also revealed in the same interview that he couldn't decide whether to name the song [...] "Well Come Back Home" [...] or [...] "Welcome Back Home" [...] but finally settled on the former. Curiously, although the song was listed on the original album and the original CD issue of (Untitled) as [...] "Well Come Back Home", it was listed as [...] "Welcome Back Home" [...] on the (Untitled)/(Unissued) re-release in 2000, possibly in error. With a running time of 7:40, the song is the longest studio recording in The Byrds' entire oeuvre. In addition, the song also continues the tradition of ending The Byrds' albums on an unusual note, with Battin chanting the Nichiren Buddhist mantra [...] "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo" [...] {{towards the end of the}} song.|$|E
