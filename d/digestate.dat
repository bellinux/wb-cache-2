In early 2007 a thermophilic anaerobic digestion facility was commissioned in Stornoway in the Western Isles. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Renewable Energy Association are also {{leading the way}} towards {{the establishment of a}} <b>digestate</b> standard to facilitate the use of solid outputs from digesters on land. Anaerobic digestion and mechanical biological treatment facilities have been planned at a number of other locations in Scotland, such as Westray.|$|E
25|$|<b>Digestate</b> is {{the solid}} {{remnants}} of the original input material to the digesters that the microbes cannot use. It also consists of the mineralised remains of the dead bacteria from within the digesters. <b>Digestate</b> can come in three forms: fibrous, liquor, or a sludge-based {{combination of the two}} fractions. In two-stage systems, different forms of <b>digestate</b> come from different digestion tanks. In single-stage digestion systems, the two fractions will be combined and, if desired, separated by further processing.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Biogas <b>digestates</b> contain {{valuable}} nutrients {{but also}} have high water contents. Di-gestates were sampled from two different biogas facilities before and after solid-liquid separation and were analyzed {{with regard to their}} composition and phosphorus (P) fractions. Additionally, to investigate the P fertilizer effects of these <b>digestates</b> in comparison with undigested slurry or TripleSuper-P (TSP), they were applied in a pot experiment (6 kg soil per pot) in an amount corresponding to 200 mg P per pot in combination with various crops (amaranth, maize, maize + beans mixed cropping, sorghum). A separation of <b>digestates</b> resulted in higher P concentrations of the solid fraction in comparison with the liquid fraction. The proportion of the readily soluble P fractions (H 2 O-P, NaHCO 3 -P) to the total P was higher than 70 % in all <b>digestates.</b> The <b>digestates</b> increased P uptake of the tested crops and concentrations of bioavailable P in the soil to the same extent as highly soluble TSP. Activities of soil enzymes were lower after application of the <b>digestates</b> in comparison to unfermented slurry. The fertilizer management of <b>digestates</b> can be improved by a solid-liquid separation since the solid fraction showed a relatively high concentration of P resulting in a reduction in application doses required to meet the P demands of crops...|$|R

25|$|The three {{principal}} {{products of}} anaerobic digestion are biogas, <b>digestate,</b> and water.|$|E
25|$|<b>Digestate</b> {{typically}} contains elements, such as lignin, that {{cannot be}} broken down by the anaerobic microorganisms. Also, the <b>digestate</b> may contain ammonia that is phytotoxic, and may hamper the growth of plants if it {{is used as a}} soil-improving material. For these two reasons, a maturation or composting stage may be employed after digestion. Lignin and other materials are available for degradation by aerobic microorganisms, such as fungi, helping reduce the overall volume of the material for transport. During this maturation, the ammonia will be oxidized into nitrates, improving the fertility of the material and making it more suitable as a soil improver. Large composting stages are typically used by dry anaerobic digestion technologies.|$|E

However, little is known on how it could alter the speciation of contaminants in organic waste. This study was focused on determining the influence of anaerobic digestion on the speciation of copper and zinc, two metals that generally occur at high concentration in organic waste. Copper and zinc speciation was investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy in four different raw organic wastes (predigestion) and their digested counterparts (postdigestion, i. e., <b>digestates).</b> The results highlighted {{an increase in the}} <b>digestates</b> of the proportion of amorphous or nanostructured copper sulfides as well as amorphous or nanostructured zinc sulfides and zinc phosphate as compared to raw waste.

40|$|Manure {{is known}} to contain {{residues}} of antibiotics administered to farm animals as well as bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). These genes are often located on mobile genetic elements. In biogas plants (BGPs), organic substrates such as manure and plant material are mixed and fermented {{in order to provide}} energy, and resulting <b>digestates</b> are used for soil fertilization. The fate of plasmid carrying bacteria from manure during the fermentation process is unknown. The present study focused on transferable antibiotic resistance plasmids from <b>digestates</b> of seven BGPs, using manure as a co-substrate, and their phenotypic and genotypic characterization. Plasmids conferring resistance to either tetracycline or sulfadiazine were captured by means of exogenous plasmid isolation from <b>digestates</b> into Pseudomonas putida KT 2442 and Escherichia coli CV 601 recipients, at transfer frequencies ranging from 10 - 5 to 10 - 7. Transconjugants (n = 101) were screened by PCR-Southern blot hybridization and real-time PCR for the presence of IncP- 1, IncP- 1 ε, IncW, IncN, IncP- 7, IncP- 9, LowGC and IncQ plasmids. While 61 plasmids remained unassigned, 40 plasmids belonged to the IncP- 1 ε subgroup. All these IncP- 1 ε plasmids were shown to harbor the genes tetA, sul 1, qacE∆ 1, intI 1 and integron gene cassette amplicons of different size. Further analysis of 16 representative IncP- 1 ε plasmids showed that they conferred six different multiple antibiotic resistance patterns and their diversity seemed to be driven by the gene cassette arrays. IncP- 1 ε plasmids displaying similar restriction and antibiotic resistance patterns were captured from different BGPs, suggesting that they may be typical for this environment. Our study showed that BGP <b>digestates</b> are a potential source of transferable antibiotic resistance plasmids and in particular the broad host range IncP- 1 ε plasmids might contribute to the spread of ARGs when <b>digestates</b> are used as fertilizer...|$|R

Dairy cattle slurry and <b>digestates</b> from anaerobic digestion of municipal solid wastes (MSW) are organic wastes containing phosphorus which can potentially be used as a secondary source of this nutrient. The present study investigated the effect of pH in phosphorus release from these wastes using acid and base extraction followed by phosphorus recovery via precipitation, targeting the production of a fertilizer. Results showed that when using HNO 3, 100 % of P content was extracted from dairy cattle slurry (2. 0 < pH < 3. 3) and 90 % from MSW <b>digestates</b> (1. 2 < pH < 1. 5). The maximum extraction was obtained after 2. 5 h for dairy cattle slurry and 48 h for MSW <b>digestates.</b> The extraction efficiencies using NaOH were only 22 % for dairy cattle slurry (12. 9 < pH < 13. 4) and 9 % for MWS <b>digestates</b> (13. 0 < pH < 13. 4). Phosphorus precipitation from extracted solutions was carried out at a molar ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 for Mg:N:P and at pH around 8. 0. Analysis of the harvested precipitates by XRD and SEM-EDS ruled out the formation of struvite, but validated the formation of amorphous calcium phosphates, a potential fertilizer that can help to close the cycle of this nutrient. During the process, heavy metals might become enriched in the precipitates. In the perspective of producing a fertilizer this is an undesirable process, and one that should be taken into account when considering phosphorus recovery from wastes...|$|R

Our results show that especially in regions with only a small amount of agricultural land and a large heterogeneity in its agricultural area, processing of <b>digestates</b> increases the profitability of biogas production. The same accounts for regions with high livestock density, where the area needed for disposal is comparatively large.

25|$|Some systems {{incorporate}} both {{anaerobic digestion}} and composting. This may either {{take the form}} of a full anaerobic digestion phase, followed by the maturation (composting) of the <b>digestate.</b> Alternatively a partial anaerobic digestion phase can be induced on water that is percolated through the raw waste, dissolving the readily available sugars, with the remaining material being sent to a windrow composting facility.|$|E

In this event, <b>digestate</b> exiting the system will be darker in colour and will typically have more odour.|$|E
40|$|Globally, {{there is}} growing {{interest}} in microalgae production as innovative vegetable biomass rich in phytochemicals at high added value to apply in different commercial sectors (food, feed, nutraceutical, cosmetician and wastewaters depuration) and as future biodiesel source for the high lipid content and fatty acid profile of some species. To date the microalgae market for food and feed is a niche market but it is increasingly relevant and strictly correlate to their chemical composition (in particular lipids, fatty acids profile, proteins, carbohydrates, pigments and vitamins), underlying that microalgae biomass {{has the potential to}} be competitive respect the others conventional vegetable sources. From a point of view of biodiesel source the microalgae production is yet too expensive, both for fertilizers cost both for energy consumption for harvesting, drying and extraction. To develop the competitiveness of microalgae based products, some technical and economic aspects, that play a key role in biomass production costs and in production environmental sustainability, have to be considered. In the present research liquid <b>digestates</b> from anaerobic digestion of organic waste and food industry by-products were analyzed as alternative cheap fertilizer for autotrophic and heterotrophic microalgae production. An overview in terms of possible application of produced biomass in commercial sector on the basis of EU legislation was also considered. The thesis work consists of four experiments: 1) An overview of the use of liquid <b>digestates</b> and food industry by-products as microalgae grow media; 2) Heterotrophic production of Galdieria sulphuraria in spent cherry brines and its effects on the biomass productivity and composition; 3) The growth and the ability to metabolize the nutrients presents in different liquid <b>digestates</b> of two species of freshwater microalgae (S. obliquus, B. braunii), a marine diatom (P. tricornutum), and a photosynthetic cyanobacterium (A. maxima); 4) The evaluation of biomass productivity, the carbon dioxide fixation rate and the biochemical composition of two microalgal species, P. tricornutum and S. obliquus, grew indoors in high-tech photobioreactors and open ponds and low photobioreactors technology in greenhouses in southern Italy. Microalgae were cultivated using standard medium and two liquid <b>digestates</b> obtained by anaerobic digestion of vegetable biomass and zootechnical wastes. In conclusion the alternative media applied showed the ability to support sustainably the microalgae production, leading a reduction of productivity of about 25 % with the use of by-products of confectionary industry, and a productivity in line with the standard medium with the use of liquid <b>digestates</b> for S. obliquus and P. tricornutum. Furthermore, the biochemical profile changes of biomass produced with the use of the liquid <b>digestates</b> were highlighted, in terms of lipids (average increase of 55 %) and carbohydrates (average decrease of about 5 %). With the use of by-products from the confectionary industry was observed a variation in the nutritional composition of the biomass, with an average reduction of about 35 % of the protein and lipid content and, with an increase of about 70 % in terms of polyphenols, in particular anthocyanins, and with an increase of 12 % of carbohydrates. Also the lipid profile showed the variations, a decrease of about 70 % of saturated fatty acids and an increase of 10 % of unsaturated FA for liquid <b>digestates</b> and by products from confectionary industry utilized. The different microalgae species utilized were metabolized and reduced by about 90 % the NH 4 + -N The different microalgae species were highlighted a good capacity of phyto-remediation with a reduction of about 90 % the NH 4 + -N and a reduction of PO 4 of about 86 %.

At dose corresponding to 140 [*]kg NH 4 +-N ha− 1, 30. 9 – 32. 5 % {{of the carbon}} applied in BD-A, BD-C, and PS was utilized during 12 days, while for BD-B and BD-D corresponding utilization was 19. 0 and 16. 9 %, respectively. All BDs resulted in net nitrogen assimilation at low rates (17. 5 – 140 [*]kg NH 4 +-N ha− 1) but net mineralization dominated at higher rates. PS resulted in net mineralization at all application rates. All residues inhibited potential ammonium oxidation (PAO), with EC 50 -values ranging between 45 and 302 [*]kg NH 4 +-N ha− 1. Low rates of BDs appeared to weakly stimulate potential denitrification activity (PDA), while higher rates resulted in logarithmic decrease. The EC 50 -values for PDA were between 238 and 347 [*]kg NH 4 +-N ha− 1. No inhibition of PDA was observed after amendment with PS. In conclusion, biogas <b>digestates</b> inhibited ammonia oxidation and denitrification, which could be an early warning of potential hazardous substances in the <b>digestates.</b> However, this effect can also be regarded as positive, since it may reduce nitrogen losses...|$|R

25|$|High solids (dry) digesters are {{designed}} to process materials with a solids content between 25 and 40%. Unlike wet digesters that process pumpable slurries, high solids (dry – stackable substrate) digesters {{are designed}} to process solid substrates without the addition of water. The primary styles of dry digesters are continuous vertical plug flow and batch tunnel horizontal digesters. Continuous vertical plug flow digesters are upright, cylindrical tanks where feedstock is continuously fed {{into the top of}} the digester, and flows downward by gravity during digestion. In batch tunnel digesters, the feedstock is deposited in tunnel-like chambers with a gas-tight door. Neither approach has mixing inside the digester. The amount of pretreatment, such as contaminant removal, depends both upon the nature of the waste streams being processed and the desired quality of the <b>digestate.</b> Size reduction (grinding) is beneficial in continuous vertical systems, as it accelerates digestion, while batch systems avoid grinding and instead require structure (e.g. yard waste) to reduce compaction of the stacked pile. Continuous vertical dry digesters have a smaller footprint due to the shorter effective retention time and vertical design. Wet digesters can be designed to operate in either a high-solids content, with a total suspended solids (TSS) concentration greater than ~20%, or a low-solids concentration less than ~15%.|$|E
2500|$|A limit {{case has}} been reached in Bolivia, with {{anaerobic}} digestion in temperature working conditions of less than 10°C. The anaerobic process is very slow, taking {{more than three times}} the normal mesophilic time process. In experimental work at University of Alaska Fairbanks, a 1,000 litre digester using psychrophiles harvested from [...] "mud from a frozen lake in Alaska" [...] has produced 200–300litres of methane per day, about 20 to 30% of the output from digesters in warmer climates. Mesophilic species outnumber thermophiles, and they are also more tolerant to changes in environmental conditions than thermophiles. Mesophilic systems are, therefore, considered to be more stable than thermophilic digestion systems. In contrast, while thermophilic digestion systems are considered less stable, their energy input is higher, with more biogas being removed from the organic matter in an equal amount of time. The increased temperatures facilitate faster reaction rates, and thus faster gas yields. Operation at higher temperatures facilitates greater pathogen reduction of the <b>digestate.</b> In countries where legislation, such as the Animal By-Products Regulations in the European Union, requires <b>digestate</b> to meet certain levels of pathogen reduction there may be a benefit to using thermophilic temperatures instead of mesophilic.|$|E

Increased energy production from biomass will inevitably {{lead to higher}} input of its by-products to the soil as amendments or fertilizers. However, it is still unclear how these by-products will influence microbial transformation processes in soil, and thereby its greenhouse gas (GHG) balance and organic C stocks. In this study, we assess C and N dynamics and GHG emissions following application of different bioenergy by-products to soil. Ten by-products were selected from different bioenergy chains: anaerobic digestion (manure <b>digestates),</b> first generation biofuel by-products (rapeseed meal, distilled dried grains with solubles), second-generation biofuel by-products (nonfermentables from hydrolysis of different lignocellulosic materials) and pyrolysis (biochars). These by-products were added at a constant N rate (150 kg N ha- 1) to a sandy soil and incubated at 20 °C. After 60 days, > 80 % of applied C had been emitted as CO 2 in the first-generation biofuel residue treatments. For second-generation biofuel residues this was approximately 60 %, and for <b>digestates</b> 40 %. Biochars were the most stable residues with the lowest CO 2 loss (between 0. 5 % and 5. 8 % of total added C). Regarding N 2 O emissions, addition of first-generation biofuel residues led to the highest total N 2 O emissions (between 2. 5 % and 6. 0 % of applied N).
