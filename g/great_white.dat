5|$|It {{is unclear}} {{how much of a}} {{concurrent}} increase in fishing for <b>great</b> <b>white</b> sharks has caused the decline of <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark populations from the 1970s to the present. No accurate global population numbers are available, but the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark is now considered vulnerable. Sharks taken during the long interval between birth and sexual maturity never reproduce, making population recovery and growth difficult.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon is now {{considered}} {{to be a member of}} the family Otodontidae, genus Carcharocles, as opposed to it previous classification into Lamnidae, genus Carcharodon. Megalodon's classification into Carcharodon was due to dental similarity with the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark, but most authors currently believe that this is due to convergent evolution. In this model, the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark is more closely related to the shark Isurus hastalis than to megalodon, as evidenced by more similar dentition in those two sharks; megalodon teeth have much finer serrations than <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark teeth. The <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark is more closely related to the mako shark (Isurus spp.), with a common ancestor around 4 mya. However, proponents of the former model, wherein megalodon and the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark are more closely related, argue that the differences between their dentition are minute and obscure.|$|E

5|$|Generally sharks {{have only}} one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark, have two to three layers or more, {{depending}} on body size. The jaws of a large <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark may have up to five layers. In the rostrum (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts.|$|E

5|$|One {{interpretation}} on how megalodon appeared {{was that}} it was a robust-looking shark, and may have had a similar build to the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark. The jaws may have been blunter and wider than the <b>great</b> <b>white,</b> and the fins would have also been similar in shape, though thicker due to its size. It may have had a pig-eyed appearance, in that it had deep-set and small eyes.|$|E

50|$|The Taylors {{felt that}} the Australian sharks may have a {{slightly}} different disposition to South African ones, but {{as it is now}} known that <b>Great</b> <b>Whites</b> swim between South Africa and Australia, this is open to debate.

5|$|Prior to August 1981, no <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark {{in captivity}} lived longer than 11 days.

5|$|Sharks often employ complex hunting {{strategies}} to engage large prey animals. <b>Great</b> <b>white</b> shark hunting strategies may {{be similar to}} how megalodon hunted its large prey. However, megalodon bite marks on whale fossils suggests that it employed different hunting strategies against large prey than the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark.|$|E
5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark has {{no known}} natural predators other than, on very rare occasion, the killer whale.

5|$|The {{narrative}} of Abzû is told wordlessly through gameplay and using cutscenes, {{taking place in}} a vast ocean. The player character, {{referred to as a}} female diver, awakens floating in the ocean and begins exploring the surrounding sea: ruins and ancient murals show that an ancient civilization which shared a symbiotic connection with the ocean. As she explores, she is led by a <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark to wells that—when activated using an energy from within her—restore life to the local seas. That energy is being forcefully harvested by pyramid-like devices, the development of which disrupted the ocean's balance and brought about the civilization's downfall. Upon reaching the original pyramid, the diver sees the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark attacking it, and the pyramid's counterattack damages the diver—revealing her to be mechanical and confirming her existence as a being connected to the pyramid and capable of restoring life to the ocean—and mortally wounds the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark, which dies as the diver comforts it. After activating the final well, the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark manifests and guides the repaired diver back to the pyramid. The diver destroys the pyramid, causing life to return to the ocean. During the credits, the diver and <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark swim together through the revitalized ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} {{conservation status}} of the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark is reflected by all Australian states under their respective laws, granting the species full protection throughout Australia regardless of jurisdiction. Many states had prohibited the killing or possession of <b>great</b> <b>white</b> sharks prior to national legislation coming into effect. The <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark is further listed as Threatened in Victoria under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, and as rare or likely to become extinct under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife Conservation Act in Western Australia.|$|E

5|$|However, some {{researchers}} have hypothesized that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not because sharks do not like human flesh, but because humans are often able to escape after the first bite. In the 1980s, John McCosker, Chair of Aquatic Biology at the California Academy of Sciences, noted that divers who dove solo and were bitten by <b>great</b> <b>whites</b> were generally at least partially consumed, while divers who followed the buddy system were generally rescued by their companion. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas, an author and professor at the University of Hawaii, suggest that a standard pattern for <b>great</b> <b>whites</b> is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal. Humans' ability {{to move out of}} reach with the help of others, thus foiling the attack, is unusual for a <b>great</b> <b>white's</b> prey.|$|R

5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that other notable species of sharks, such as the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark, responded to competitive pressure from megalodon by avoiding regions it inhabited by mainly inhabiting the cooler waters of the time. In areas where their ranges seemed to overlap, such as in Pliocene Baja California, {{it is possible that}} megalodon and the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark occupied the area at different times of the year while following different migratory prey. Megalodon probably also had a tendency for cannibalism, much like contemporary sharks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Great</b> <b>white</b> sharks were {{previously}} thought to reach sexual maturity at around 15 years of age, but are now believed to take far longer; male <b>great</b> <b>white</b> sharks reach sexual maturity at age 26, while females take 33 {{years to reach}} sexual maturity. Maximum life span was originally believed {{to be more than}} 30 years, but a study by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution placed it at upwards of 70 years. Examinations of vertebral growth ring count gave a maximum male age of 73 years and a maximum female age of 40 years for the specimens studied. The shark's late sexual maturity, low reproductive rate and slow growth make it vulnerable to pressures such as overfishing and environmental change.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> shark's mating habits. It is {{possible}} that whale carcasses are an important location for sexually mature sharks to meet for mating. Birth has never been observed, but pregnant females have been examined. <b>Great</b> <b>white</b> sharks are ovoviviparous, which means eggs develop and hatch in the uterus and continue to develop until birth. The <b>great</b> <b>white</b> has an 11-month gestation period. The shark pup's powerful jaws begin to develop in the first month. The unborn sharks participate in oophagy, in which they feed on ova produced by the mother. Delivery is in spring and summer. The Northern Pacific population of great whites is suspected to breed off of the Sea of Cortez, as evidenced by local fisherman who have said to have caught them and evidenced by teeth found at dump sites for discarded parts from their catches.|$|E
