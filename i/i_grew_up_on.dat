Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one day my brother told me someone had {{come down from the}} Bureau of Petty Harassment or {{something}} and they measured the temperature of the water and had decided it was a little too warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious about this stuff. So I thought that was pretty stupid right there.|$|E

He explained: [...] "I went out and bought all the music <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> that I didn't already have and spent three months listening to only that. Only stuff from before I started making records, so it was pre-1989—Waylon, Willie, Buck Owens, Haggard, Don Williams, Jim Croce. And what I discovered was a simplicity in song that I had moved away from. It was quite an emotional journey because these were all the songs that moved me and inspired me to do what I've been doing ever since." ...|$|E

Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Marvin Gaye, Esther Williams, all kinds of different things.

500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much I {{believed}} it. I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would have to do that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and smelled like.

6000|$|Well now, there's {{one great}} form of Christian faith I {{happened}} to be born in--which to teach Was given me as <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up,</b> <b>on</b> all hands, As best and readiest means of living by; The same on examination being proved The most pronounced moreover, fixed, precise And absolute form {{of faith in the}} whole world-- Accordingly, most potent of all forms For working on the world.

There's power in me and will to dominate Which I must exercise, they hurt me else: In many ways I need mankind's respect, Obedience, and the love that's born of fear: While at the same time, there's a taste I have, A toy of soul, a titillating thing, Refuses to digest these dainties crude. The naked life is gross till clothed upon: I must take what men offer, with a grace [...] 330 As though I would not, could I help it, take An uniform I wear though over-rich-- Something imposed on me, no choice of mine; No fancy-dress worn for pure fancy's sake And despicable therefore! now folk kneel And kiss my hand--of course the Church's hand. Thus I am made, thus life is best for me, And thus that it should be I have procured; And thus it could not be another way, I venture to imagine.|$|E

[...] —Rick Nowels, who co-wrote with Madonna on Ray of Light, commented on her songwriting skill. Madonna's music {{has been the subject of}} much analysis and scrutiny. Robert M. Grant, author of Contemporary Strategy Analysis (2005), commented that what has brought Madonna success is [...] "certainly not outstanding natural talent. As a vocalist, musician, dancer, songwriter, or actress, Madonna's talents seem modest." [...] He asserts Madonna's success is in relying on the talents of others, and that her personal relationships have served as cornerstones to the numerous reinventions in the longevity of her career. Madonna's approach was far from the music industry wisdom of [...] "Find a winning formula and stick to it." [...] Her musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim. Grant concluded that [...] "having established herself as the queen of popular music, Madonna did not stop there, but continued re-inventing." [...] Musicologist Susan McClary wrote that [...] "Madonna's art itself repeatedly deconstructs the traditional notion of the unified subject with finite ego boundaries. Her pieces explore various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition." [...] Critics noted that Madonna has [...] "pushed the boundaries" [...] in her music and image.|$|R
