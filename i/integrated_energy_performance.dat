40|$|With {{the growing}} {{worldwide}} concern about energy consumption, {{we are witnessing}} to a more extensive demand for more energy efficient solutions. A great saving potential has been identified in buildings and new directives and standards are being issuing to bind the <b>integrated</b> <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> or new or renovated buildings to prescribed limits. As fa as electric lighting is concerned, an important role is played by the adoption of control strategies which have the aim to reduce consumption by means of, for instance, daylight integration or lighting switching based on the real or expected occupancy of spaces. The influence of different control strategies and different building features on lighting enery demand is investigated in the paper. The analysis {{has been carried out}} through the use and comparison of two simulation tools: one simplified calculation method, recently proposed by the European Standard EN 15193, and a freeware software named Daysim.

40|$|With the Europe-wide {{introduction}} of the energy certification for buildings (<b>Energy</b> <b>Performance</b> of Buildings Directive, EPBD, 2002) the accurate assessment of the <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> of buildings becomes increasingly important for property valuation. The energy certification is a means to predict the energy efficiency of a building and hence energy costs and the overall long-term investment quality of the building. With respect to rising and volatile energy costs {{and the fact that}} <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> measurements such as energy certificates or life cycle costing (LCC) are a means to predict the energy efficiency of a building the impact of <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> will potentially influence the market behaviour of investors, tenants and property owners.

40|$|Within IEA Task 27 {{the topic}} of energy {{performance}} of advanced windows and facades was taken up in an international cooperation project. Different approaches throughout the various member countries were presented and discussed with the aim to develop the methodologies further and to harmonize the approaches. This work seemed to fit to the European Energy Performance Directive (EBPD) published in January 2003 as 2002 / 92 /EG, where {{the topic of}} a certification of the whole building - building structure and technical building services is being taken up. The directive works on the subsidiarity principle with a harmonised European structure and local national implementations. A methodology for calculating <b>integrated</b> <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> EP is needed, {{which can be used}} for specifiying the minimum requirements on EP of new buildings and for large existing buildings under major renovations, and for energy certification. The EPD shall be fully implemented in January 2006 and due to the tight time frame only little time was left to develop (inter) national integrated methods and certification schemes. In the following paper the general ideas within the IEA group are presented. These ideas could partially be transported into the national and European standardization groups through individual members, but many other issues had to be respected as well. Two basic approaches were identified which have different advantages and disadvantages. One is the so-called component performance assessment methodology (CPAM) where the performance of the façade is characterized with physical quantities associated alone with the building element. The second approach is the building performance assessment methodology, where the performance is characterized indirectly via building performance indicators, i. e. the components influence on overall building performance is the meter stick. Both methodologies and some aspects of the discussion within the standardisation organizations on the way to an European Building Performance standard will be described in the paper...|$|E

To promote sustainable design in the built environment, architecture must therefore assume a further dimension, conscientiously responding to the context where it is built and to the environment as a whole.

40|$|<b>Integrating</b> {{daylight}} and <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> with optimization {{into the design}} process {{has always been a}} challenge for designers. Most of the building environmental performance simulation tools require a considerable amount of time and iterations for achieving accurate results. Moreover the combination of {{daylight and}} <b>energy</b> <b>performances</b> has always been an issue, as different software packages are needed to perform detailed calculations. A simplified method to overcome both issues using recent advances in software integration is explored here. As a case study; the optimization of external shadings in a typical office space in Australia is presented. Results are compared against common solutions adopted as industry standard practices. Visual comfort and energy efficiency are analysed in an integrated approach. The DIVA (Design, Iterate, Validate and Adapt) plug-in for Rhinoceros/Grasshopper software is used as the main tool, given its ability to effectively calculate daylight metrics (using the Radiance/Daysim engine) and energy consumption (using the EnergyPlus engine). The optimization process is carried out parametrically controlling the shadings’ geometries. Genetic Algorithms (GA) embedded in the evolutionary solver Galapagos are adopted in order to achieve close to optimum results by controlling iteration parameters. The optimized result, in comparison with conventional design techniques, reveals significant enhancement of comfort levels and energy efficiency.

40|$|Design is a {{creative}} and dynamic process. The level {{to which a}} future generation of Intelligent Integrated Building Design Systems {{will be able to}} support this process depends on the power of the underlying conceptual models to cover the semantics of design. In the definition of generic building models, the concept of constraints appears to be a powerful means to formalize those semantics. Both design performance goals, and rules and relations in design composition can be described as constraints. The Engineering Data Model (EDM), recently developed at UCLA, acknowledges this fact. It allows the formal definition of object oriented building models, using constraints as the central concept for describing relations. This paper will discuss the development of an EDM building model for the <b>integrated</b> design for <b>energy</b> <b>performance,</b> and the implementa-tion of this model in a small prototype system. We will specifically deal with modelling informati-on in the early design stages. This information typically consists of multiple global design alternatives on one hand, and a wide range of conflicting design goals on the other hand. In the paper, it is demonstrated that integration of these conflicting views on building performance in one coherent model is the key to obtaining an optimal design result. Using the Dutch building codes for <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> (NEN 2916) as an example of design goals, the concepts and relations of these building codes were translated to a formal EDM model. A small shell was built on top of this computer-interpretable model, to demonstrate the useability of the model during the solving of a concrete design problem.
