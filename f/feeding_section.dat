40|$|In {{generating}} a column grand composite curve (CGCC) the enthalpy values calculated by top-down and bottom-up approaches are different at the feed stage. An insight analysis {{of material and}} energy balances indicates that these differences are due to the feed stage treated as a stripping stage in the top-down approach and as a rectifying stage in the bottom-up approach. To consider the practical feed process and overcome the shortcomings in the existing CGCC generation approaches, a modified approach is proposed, dividing the column into three sections: the rectifying section (from the 1 st to the f- 2 th stage, the condenser being the 1 st stage), the <b>feeding</b> <b>section</b> (the f- 1 th and the fth stage) and the stripping section (from the f+ 1 th to the nth stage, the reboiler being the nth stage).

Experiments were conducted on a single screw extruder equipped with various pressure and temperature sensors along the screw profile. Influences of temperature of <b>feed</b> <b>section,</b> screw and barrel were characterised. In order to modify the pressure drop, different dies were used. Three parameters were varied during the tests: the screw rotation speed (15, 40 and 70 min- 1), {{the temperature of the}} <b>feed</b> <b>section</b> and barrel (30, 60 and 90 °C) and that of the screw (50 and 90 °C), and fi nally the die restriction.

Hot melt extrusion is a well recognized technology in pharmaceutical industry today and is used in the preparation of variety of dosage forms and drug delivery systems. The types of extruders currently available for hot melt extrusion are single and twin-screw extruders.

40|$|We {{present results}} of a fully {{three-dimensional}} computational study of the calendering process of thermoplastics using the fluid dynamics software OpenFOAM. Our aim is to elucidate unique 3 D features of the process, such as spreading and melt flow. We assume that the material is fed {{in the form of}} a sheet of finite thickness and detaches from the cylinders at a prescribed thickness. The rotational motion of the cylinders, the consequent pressure build-up (both in the machine and the transverse directions) and the presence of the free surfaces (sides) of the calendered sheet-both deformable and at ambient pressure-forces the thermoplastic melt to spread in the transverse direction. A decoupled iterative procedure is used to predict the shape of the spreading side surfaces under different conditions. A spiraling transverse flow pattern in the melt <b>feeding</b> <b>section</b> is shown to exist, which determines the actual flow path of the calendered material in a nonintuitive way.

40|$|Sensors such as {{phased array}} radars {{play a crucial}} role in public safety. They are {{unavoidable}} for surveillance, threat identification and post-disaster management. However, different scenarios impose immensely diverse requirements for these systems. Phased array systems occupy a large space. In addition, if different antenna systems are needed for each function, the space required can be considerably large. For transportable platforms, such as ships and aircrafts, space and weight are critical parameters. Therefore, reconfigurable multi-band antennas are very attractive solutions for future multi-function sensor systems. Within this research work three different approaches are investigated to realize antennas for reconfigurable phased arrays. Wideband antenna designs constitute the first approach. Integrating this type of antennas with frequency selective filters provide the opportunity for fine tuning within one radar band. The wideband operation of the antenna is achieved by the blind-via <b>feeding</b> <b>section</b> and the quasi electric-magnetic radiating structure. The second approach involves the design of an antenna element with p-I-n diode switches. The switches are used to alter the antenna structure and thereby the operating frequency. Measured results verified the frequency reconfigurable capability of the antenna within L/S radar bands with frequency ratio more than 2 : 1. The planar structure, the back feeding mechanism, the compact size and the simple bias network made the proposed antenna suitable for array applications. The large frequency ratio and its usability in phased array applications made the design novel. Furthermore, for these frequency reconfigurable elements, a unique multi-scale array structure is introduced which can assure wide angle scanning for both frequency bands. The advantage of this novel array configuration is twofold: reduce the mutual couplings in the lower band, and increase the scanning volume for the higher band. A planar array demonstrator validated the proposed concept. In the third approach the operational band of an antenna is tuned by variable-impedance matching. In this study, the standard 50 ? matching is avoided and many advantages of variable-impedance matching are demonstrated. First, the principle is verified by tuning the frequency band of a microstrip antenna by an input-impedance tuneable CMOS RF-frontend. In the second design a novel dual-band E-slot antenna, with 2. 5 : 1 frequency ratio, was designed. By changing the input-impedance the operating frequency of the antenna can be switched from L- to S-band. Variable-impedance matching provides few other advantages to phased array antennas. A scan-angle dependent impedance matching will assure low reflection coefficients for the entire scanning volume. On the other hand, it will reduce interfering and jamming signals coming from adjacent angles. The outcomes of this research work have led to solid understanding of how we can realize frequency reconfigurable antennas for adaptive phased arrays. The results will be particularly valuable in developing future narrow or wide beam radar systems with frequency reconfiguration and angular filtering capabilities.

40|$|Mathematical {{simulations}} {{are already}} frequently {{used for the}} design of single-screw extruders for plastics processing and have the advantage of saving not only time and personnel, but are also economical. In order to obtain simulation results for the <b>feed</b> <b>section</b> of single-screw extruders with a good accuracy, not only the friction coefficients but also the pressure coefficients (the quotient of radial and axial pressure) of plastic bulk materials must be determined. It is of great importance that the determination of these material indices is based on the real conditions of the extrusion process. With this background in mind, available measurement devices for the determination of pressure coefficients, coefficients of friction, and density of plastic bulk materials were used to set boundary conditions for calculations in this work. A measurement device was then developed, which determines the material indices of the plastic bulk materials in the dynamic state. Measurements on several plastic bulk materials show that with rising axial pressure the product of coefficient of friction and pressure coefficient decreases. On the other hand this product rises for all examined plastic bulk materials with increasing velocity. The influence of temperature on the product of coefficient of friction and pressure coefficient is substantially more complex. The dependence of the friction characteristics and the plastic bulk density on temperature, axial pressure, and velocity are determined by means of a statistical testing plan and a regression analysis, and can be quantified by a regression equation. The regression equations are used in a model, which describes the processes in the <b>feed</b> <b>section</b> of single-screw extruders in two dimensions...|$|R

Here the results of more elaborate calculations are given in which the influence of the flight clearance and of a shear-thinning temperature dependent viscosity are investigated. The former conclusions are not altered in essence by these effects. Experimental results with a prototype screw are presented, showing that melting capacity is increased. Up to 100 percent increase in throughput is possible in the high RPM range (in comparison with a much longer traditional compression screw), provided that the feed capacity is sufficient. This usually requires the use of a grooved, well-cooled, feed section; the capacity of such a <b>feed</b> <b>section</b> depends, for a given screw geometry, on channel depth and granule dimensions.
