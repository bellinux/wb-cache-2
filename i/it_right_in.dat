5|$|The PVA 38th Corps, on {{the other}} hand, was marching towards the Kunu-ri—Sunchon road {{virtually}} unopposed. On 7 a.m. at November 28, the PVA 113th Division of the 38th Corps occupied the town of Samo-ri, placing <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> {{the path of the}} 5th Cavalry Regiment and besides the Kunu-ri—Sunchon road. An hour and half later, the advance platoon from the 5th Cavalry Regiment was ambushed and destroyed. With its advance blocked, the 5th Cavalry Regiment tried to dislodge the Chinese garrison, but it was forced to turn back by the afternoon. The 113th Division then occupied the valley containing the Kunu-ri—Sunchon road at that night and blocked the retreat route of the US 2nd Infantry Division. Upon receiving the news on November 29, 1st Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, part of 27th Brigade, tried to clear the valley from the south, but the attack was halted {{due to the lack of}} heavy weapons.|$|E

I remember I had <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> the sack. I could just feel it when I dubbed it down, made the final mix from the 16-track down to mono. It {{was a feeling}} of power, it was a rush. A feeling of exaltation. Artistic beauty. It was everything ... I remember saying, 'Oh my God. Sit back and listen to this!'" ...|$|E

She said [...] "They had done this brilliant thing {{and now they were}} going to undo it. They were just being practical. They said, [...] "It would be hours to get you back, your hair, your make-up." [...] Smart spoke to the hair and makeup artists and guaranteed producers they could get <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> two takes; they did it in one, and the scene stayed in.|$|E
500|$|After Bowie married Iman in {{a private}} {{ceremony}} in 1992, he said they knew that their [...] "real marriage, sanctified by God, had to happen in a church in Florence". Earlier that year, he knelt on stage at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recited the Lord's Prayer before a television audience of up to one billion people. In 1993, Bowie said he had an [...] "undying" [...] belief in the [...] "unquestionable" [...] existence of God. Interviewed in 2005, Bowie said whether God exists [...] "is not a question that can be answered.... I'm not quite an atheist and it worries me. There's that little bit that holds on: 'Well, I'm almost an atheist. Give {{me a couple of}} months.... I've nearly got <b>it</b> <b>right.</b> <b>In</b> his will, Bowie stipulated that he be cremated and his ashes scattered in Bali [...] "in accordance with the Buddhist rituals".|$|E
500|$|Yelp {{added the}} ability for {{business}} owners to respond to reviews in 2008. Businesses can respond privately by messaging the reviewer or publicly on their profile page. In some cases, Yelp users that had a bad experience have updated their reviews more favorably due to the businesses' efforts to make <b>it</b> <b>right.</b> <b>In</b> other cases disputes between reviewers and business owners have led to harassment and physical altercations. The system has led to criticisms that business owners can bribe reviewers with free food or discounts to increase their rating, though Yelp users say this rarely occurs. A business owner can [...] "claim" [...] a profile, which allows them to respond to reviews and see traffic reports. Businesses can also offer discounts to Yelp users that visit often using the [...] "check in" [...] feature. In 2014, Yelp released an app for business owners to respond to reviews and manage their profiles from a mobile device. Business owners can also flag a review to be removed, if the review violates Yelp's content guidelines.|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers behind Twilight {{worked to}} create a film that was as {{faithful}} to the novel as they thought possible when converting the story to another medium, with producer Greg Mooradian saying, [...] "It's very important to distinguish that we're making a separate piece of art that obviously is going to remain very, very faithful to the book.... But at the same time, we have a separate responsibility {{to make the best}} movie you can make." [...] To ensure a faithful adaptation, Meyer was kept very involved in the production process, having been invited to visit the set during filming and even asked to give notes on the script and on a rough cut of the film. Of this process, she said, [...] "It was a really pleasant exchange [...] from the beginning, which I think is not very typical. They were really interested in my ideas", and, [...] "...they kept me in the loop and with the script, they let me see it and said, 'What are your thoughts?'... They let me have input on it and I think they took 90 percent of what I said and just incorporated <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> to the script." [...] Meyer fought for one line in particular, one of the most well-known from the book about [...] "the lion and the lamb", to be kept verbatim in the film: [...] "I actually think the way Melissa [...] wrote it sounded better for the movie [...] {{but the problem is that}} line is actually tattooed on peoples' bodies [...] But I said, 'You know, if you take that one and change it, that's a potential backlash situation. Meyer was even invited {{to create a}} written list of things that could not be changed for the film, such as giving the vampires fangs or killing characters who do not die in the book, that the studio agreed to follow. The consensus among critics is that the filmmakers succeeded in making a film that is very faithful to its source material, with one reviewer stating that, with a few exceptions, [...] "Twilight the movie is unerringly faithful to the source without being hamstrung by it." ...|$|E

In the case of Bundy and the Gold Butte designations, the government did it right.

2500|$|GLaDOS' mocking of Chell was {{met with}} {{negative}} reception from Neal Stapel, an adoptive parent profiled by 1UP.com. He stated that [...] "it literally pokes fun for not having parents", and stopped playing when he first heard the insult. He added that [...] "it throws the ultimate question that that child {{is ever going to}} have for you... and it just throws <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> the living room." [...] Kotaku's Michael McWhertor felt that while it was [...] "awkward" [...] for the parents, the fact that GLaDOS was trying to kill Chell would be more upsetting. He also pointed out that [...] "morons and the overweight are also mocked by robots" [...] in Portal 2. 1UP.com's Chris Pereira found the joke [...] "harmless".|$|E

2500|$|Ryan, one of {{the last}} actors to be cast, was invited because Iñárritu had seen her in the play Detroit.

[...] "It's delicious because of the writing." [...] But like Shiner's character, Iñárritu found casting Laura difficult. Riseborough met him on a street corner for a cup of tea, and recalling the event, said [...] "I told him that I would crawl across hot coals to work with him". Iñárritu described Laura as [...] "a very wacky, quirky role", but said [...] "when [...] did it I knew that it was her, because she did <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> the tone, and she understood who she was – she was not judging".|$|E

Local Democrats organized an appreciation dinner on November 21, 1963 with over 3200 attendees {{to persuade him to}} run for another term. The most visible attendees were President John F. Kennedy and Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson who both spoke of Thomas's leadership. Kennedy said, [...] "Next month, when the United States of America fires the largest booster {{in the history of the}} world into space for the first time, giving us the lead, fires the largest, payroll -- payload -- into space, giving us the lead.

60|$|I will retort the {{question}} of the Leader of the Opposition by another question. Has the House of Lords ever been right? Has it ever been right in any of the great settled controversies which are now beyond the reach of Party argument? Was <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> delaying Catholic emancipation and the removal of Jewish disabilities? Was <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> driving this country to the verge of revolution in its effort to defeat the passage of reform? Was <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> resisting the Ballot Bill? Was <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> the almost innumerable efforts it made to prevent this House dealing with the purity of its own electoral machinery? Was <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> endeavouring to prevent the abolition of purchase in the Army? Was <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>in</b> 1880, when it rejected the Compensation for Disturbance Bill? I defy the Party opposite to produce a single instance of a settled controversy in which the House of Lords was right.|$|E
