40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the division of}} <b>founder</b> <b>shares</b> in entrepreneurial ventures, focusing on the decision {{of whether or not}} to divide the shares equally among all founders. To motivate the empirical analysis we develop a simple theory of costly bargaining, where founders trade off the simplicity of accepting an equal split, with the costs of negotiating a differentiated allocation of founder equity. We test the predictions of the theory on a proprietary dataset comprised of 1, 476 founders in 511 entrepreneurial ventures. The empirical analysis consists of three main steps. First we consider determinants of equal splitting. We identify three founder characteristics –idea generation, prior entrepreneurial experience and founder capital contributions – regarding which greater team heterogeneity reduces the likelihood of equal splitting. Second, we show that these same founder characteristics also significantly affect the share premium in teams that split the equity unequally. Third, we show that equal splitting is associated with lower pre-money valuations in first financing rounds. Further econometric tests suggest that, as predicted by the theory, this effect is driven by unobservable heterogeneity, and it is more pronounced in teams that make quick decisions about <b>founder</b> <b>share</b> allocations. In addition we perform some counterfactual calculations that estimate the amount of money ‘left on the table’ by stronger founders who agree to an equal split. We estimate that the value at stake is approximately 10 % of the firm equity, 25 % of the average founder stake, or $ 450 K in net present value. ...|$|R

The organization got its name from a journal written by its <b>founder,</b> <b>sharing</b> his experiences during a trip to eastern Congo in 2008. During that trip, Falling Whistles' founder met a group of five former child soldiers who told him that some children who were too young to carry weapons were sent into battle armed only with whistles. By wearing whistles, the campaign aims to use this weapon as a tool of protest and to raise awareness of the situation in Congo. As of September 2010, $500,000 has been raised.|$|R

40|$|Many {{economic}} activities are organized as partnerships. These are ventures formed with capital contributions by partnership members that in exchange obtain {{a share of}} ownership. The design of the partnership rules dictates {{how much of the}} profits are distributed among the members and how much are reinvested. In this paper, we study the optimal design of partner-ships under the assumption that one of the members (the founder) privately observes shocks to his liquidity needs. When the ownership <b>share</b> of the <b>founder</b> is large enough, private informa-tion is immaterial and the ownership structure remains constant over time. The founder has no incentives to misreport because a fraction of the increase in his payouts after reporting high liq-uidity needs is financed by disinvesting in the partnership. When the <b>founder’s</b> ownership <b>share</b> is not big enough, the ownership structure of the partnership must vary over time to prevent misreporting. In the long run, only two possible outcomes have positive probability: Either (i) the ownership <b>shares</b> of the <b>founder</b> converge to zero (i. e., “immiserization, ” as in other models of private information), or (ii) the <b>founder’s</b> <b>share</b> of the partnership becomes too big to cheat (i. e., his incentives to misreport vanish) and thus both partners own a constant positive share of the partnership forever...|$|R

40|$|The {{origins of}} Ashkenazi Jews remain highly controversial. Like Judaism, {{mitochondrial}} DNA is passed along the maternal line. Its {{variation in the}} Ashkenazim is highly distinctive, with four major and numerous minor founders. However, due to their rarity in the general population, these founders {{have been difficult to}} trace to a source. Here we show that all four major founders, ~ 40 % of Ashkenazi mtDNA variation, have ancestry in prehistoric Europe, rather than the Near East or Caucasus. Furthermore, most of the remaining minor <b>founders</b> <b>share</b> a similar deep European ancestry. Thus the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Levant, as commonly supposed, nor recruited in the Caucasus, as sometimes suggested, but assimilated within Europe. These results point to a significant role for the conversion of women in the formation of Ashkenazi communities, and provide the foundation for a detailed reconstruction of Ashkenazi genealogical history...|$|R
