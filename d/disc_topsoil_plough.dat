The study area is located in the North Poland, within the Brodnica Lakeland and it includes the direct catchment area of dwindling Sumowskie Lakes. There were three test area established for soil mapping. The photointerpretation was based on both immediate properties (colour of <b>topsoil)</b> for <b>ploughed</b> cultivated fields, and intermediate properties (vegetation and relief) for the areas of forests, shrubs or permanent pasture. The obtained results confirm the high usability of the cartographic materials such as aerial photographs and topographic maps for studies on specifications of areas such as the vicinities of dwindling lakes...|$|R

40|$|Selenium is an {{essential}} element for humans, animals and some species of microorganisms. The biological function of selenium shows dual characteristics. The selenium content range between toxic and deficient concentration is very narrow. The present paper discusses the geographical distribution of two forms (total and water-soluble) of selenium in <b>topsoil</b> (<b>plough</b> layer for cultivated soils, eluvial horizon for natural soils) and evaluates its relationship with some human health problems in China. Topsoil samples, 354 in total, including 156 natural and 198 cultivated soils of 21 main soil types were collected. The total Se concentration in soil samples was determined with DAN (diaminonaphthalene) -fluorescence spectrophotometer method. Soil water-soluble Se concentration was determined with the same method after extraction with water (water/soil = 5 : 1). The {{results showed that the}} geometric and arithmetic means of total Se concentration in soil, for all samples, were 0. 173 mg/kg and 0. 239 mg/kg, respectively, with the lowest value being 0. 022 mg/kg and the highest being 3. 806 mg/kg. For the cultivated soil, the geometric mean of total Se was 0. 188 mg/kg, its arithmetic mean was 0. 269 mg/kg and higher than those in the natural soil, 0. 154 mg/kg and 0. 206 mg/kg, respectively. The geometric and arithmetic means of water-soluble Se in soil for all the samples were 4. 0 and 6. 4 mug/kg, the lowest 0. 6 mug/kg and the highest value being 109. 4 mug/kg. For the cultivated soils, the average concentration of water-soluble Se was 4. 3 mug/kg, similar to that of natural soil, they are and 4. 4 mug/kg by geometric mean. Two sequences of the soil types, arranged separately in the concentration of total Se and water-soluble Se, are different and this demonstrates that the proportions of the two forms of selenium existing in various soils are different. The percentages of water-soluble Se to total Se in different types of soils varied from 1. 07 to 6. 69 %. However, generally the laterite and other subtropic soil still have relatively high absolute water-soluble Se contents because of their higher total Se contents. A very significant correlation between total Se and water-soluble Se has been found in cultivated soil with a correlation coefficient of 0. 58 (P < 0. 01). The relationships between soil Se and human endemic diseases Keshan disease, Kashin-Back diseases and selenosis have been discussed. The reference criteria for evaluating Se deficiency and Se excess in soil were suggested. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Researches {{have been}} carried out within the {{framework}} on the EFFICOND Project, focused at evaluating the effectiveness of the standards of Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAECs) established for Cross Compliance implementation under EC Regulation 1782 / 2003. In particular the standard 3. 1 b deals with soil structure protection through appropriate machinery use, with particular reference to ploughing in good soil moisture conditions. The study deals with the evaluation of soil structure after tillage in tilth and no-tilth conditions at soil moisture contents other than the optimum water content for tillage. The Mean Weight Diameter (MWD) of water stable aggregates was used as an indicator of tillage effectiveness. The study was carried out in the period 2008 - 2009 at six experimental farms belonging to Research Centres and Units of the Italian Agricultural Research Council (CRA) with different pedo-climatic and cropping conditions. Farm management and data collection in the different sites were carried out by the local CRA researchers and technicians. The comparison of MWD values in tilth and no tilth theses showed statistically significant differences in most cases, depending on topsoil texture. On clay, clay loam, silty clay, and silty clay loam topsoils a general and significant increase of MWD values under no tilth conditions were observed. No significant differences were observed in silt loam and sandy loam textures, probably due to the weak soil structure of the <b>topsoils.</b> Moreover, <b>ploughing</b> in good soil moisture condition determined higher crop production and less weed development than ploughing in high soil moisture conditions...|$|R
40|$|The French {{legislation}} {{for the management}} of potentially polluted sites requires that " the state of the soils of the site under study" be compared to the state of neighbouring natural soils. That is why diverse institutions try to find local data relating to trace metal concentrations in the soil (often called 'background values'), to use as points of comparison and thereby estimate the contamination level of the studied soil. However, in industrial or urban context, {{it is very difficult to}} find "natural soils" located in the vicinity. More often than not, these assessments can at best be carried out with reference to soils considered to be relatively little-contaminated, namely the closest agricultural soils. In France, a large data collection was carried out on a national scale. These data were provided by analyses made in <b>ploughed</b> <b>topsoils,</b> undertaken mainly within the framework of sewage sludge spreading plans. The data collected on the area of the region Centre have been processed and stratified according to "agricultural districts", territories much less heterogeneous from geological and pedological standpoints than administrative subdivisions. The usual measures of position (percentiles) and of dispersion (upper whiskers) have been determined for each agricultural district. These indicators may be used as appropriate reference values...|$|R
40|$|Planners {{would like}} a simple means of {{describing}} spatial and temporal variations in soil erodibility accurately. We have done a series of concentrated flow detachment experiments to investigate the feasibility. Four different soil horizons, typical of loess-derived soils in Belgium, were sampled seven times during one year, so that a representative range of initial soil moisture contents was obtained. Undisturbed soil samples were subjected to five different combinations of slope gradient and concentrated flow discharge. Results showed that for a given soil horizon, variations in detachment rate could be related well to temporal variations in initial soil moisture content. For a given initial soil moisture content the <b>ploughed</b> <b>topsoil</b> horizon (A(p)) and the underlying clay-enriched horizon (B-t) had only one fifth of the erodibility of the loess horizon whether decalcified (C- 1) or still calcareous (C- 2). Combining knowledge on spatial distribution of soil profiles and initial soil moisture content allowed us to explain observed spatial and temporal variations in resistance to ephemeral gully erosion for soils in loess. Also, differences in ephemeral gully morphology (cross-sections) could be explained from differences in initial soil moisture content and soil horizon. In the short term these results {{have important implications for}} spatial and temporal variations in erosion, while in the medium or long term information on spatial distribution of soil profiles is crucial when predicting the volumes and patterns of (ephemeral gully) erosion. Finally, the importance of combining the effect of water and tillage erosion with respect to soil profile evolution and consequent erosion risk is stressed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Comprehensive {{research}} into phosphorus (P) in soils and crops began in Finland {{in the early}} 1900 s. The average amount of total P in the <b>ploughed</b> <b>topsoil</b> layer of mineral soils was about two tonnes per hectare in the 1930 s, before the abundant use of fertilisers. The main chemical fractions of P in mineral soils were organic matter, primary apatite and secondary complexes of the hydrous oxides of Al and Fe. Of the smaller amounts of P in light peat soils, as much as 80 % was present in stable organic compounds. Field experiments showed that the native P reserves of Finnish soils are poorly available to plants, and that P fertilisers are inefficiently utilised because of the strong fixation of applied phosphate in soils. In evaluations before the late 1950 s, all simple chemical tests appeared to be rather unreliable indicators of the supply of P from soils to plants, but later {{research has shown that}} the results were impaired by errors implicit in the research materials. Some soil test P values (STP) obtained from old samples stored for more than ten years evidently were too high, particularly for organic soils, and many of the soils studied were strongly acidic and therefore biologically less fertile than the chemical P tests indicated. The acid ammonium acetate method (pH 4. 65) was introduced in the early 1950 s and has since been used in routine soil testing in Finland, not only for P but for all macronutrients except N. In later evaluations of different methods used for estimating the requirement of P fertilisation, the acid ammonium acetate method has proven equal or superior to any other simple chemical method. ...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{variability}} of soil structure complicates interpretation of investigations on soil physical properties and {{their influence on}} crop growth. Especially, for pleistocene sandy and sandy-loamy soils, small scale heterogeneity and the range over which observations give reliable estimates {{on the state of}} soil properties have to be considered. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the variability structure of various soil physical and morphological parameter in a field soil. In an Albic Luvisol under conventional tillage located in Miincheberg, Germany, numbers and pore area fraction of macropores > 200 |im were determined for samples taken from the topsoil layer (15 cm average soil depth), a layer compacted by wheel traffic (30 cm) and the subsoil (55 cm). For macropore determinations polished blocks of soil samples were used, stabilized with polyester resin (stained by fluoresceine). In the same layers, soil texture, saturated hydraulic conductivity, air permeability, dry bulk density and rootability were investigated for samples from 25 profiles in a 4 ha block within a 60 ha field. In the subsoil, clay content, total carbon content, dry bulk density and rootability were autocorrelated over a distance of about 25 to 50 m. Whereas soil structural parameters, such as numbers and area of macropores as well as permeability properties varied randomly even over the shortest distance sampled (10 cm). For the <b>topsoil</b> and the <b>plough</b> pan, variability appeared to be unstructured in case of hydraulic conductivity, air permeability, dry bulk density, rootability and number and area of macropores.

40|$|The {{effect of}} a single deep {{ploughing}} to 35 and 50 cm depth on subsequent crop yields on sandy soil was investigated {{in a series of}} 5 - 6 year experiments on 14 Swedish sites. Root depth was restricted to the topsoil on all sites prior to treatments, and the sand type was coarse (0. 6 - 2. 0 mm) on 1 site, medium (0. 2 - 0. 6 mm) on 7 sites and fine (0. 06 - 0. 2 mm) on the remaining 6 sites (Table 1). The {{effect of a}}n additional 30 kg N/ha fertilizer was investigated as a secondary treatment. Ploughing to 35 cm depth improved yields relative to the normal ploughed control by on average 4 % (Table 6). However, this positive effect was greatest in years 1 - 3 and had disappeared within 5 years. Ploughing to 50 cm depth had on the whole no or a somewhat negative effect compared to normal ploughing (Table 7). Positive results were obtained on the coarser sands, and on all sands in dry years. In wet years, however, there were indications of aeration problems in the ploughed-in topsoil on fine sands. Root studies showed that rooting depth was on average 5 - 15 cm greater on soil which had been ploughed to 50 cm. Where positive effects were obtained, they were obviously due to increased water availability to the crop. The negative effects observed were probably due to aeration problems on fine sands and more particularly to soil recompaction during secondary tillage after the deep ploughing treatment. The reduction in organic matter content of the topsoil due to its mixing with the subsoil was likely to have increased the sensitivity to compaction of these sandy soils. The application of an extra 30 kg N/ha improved yields by 6 - 7 % at all 3 ploughing depths investigated. Thus there was no additional advantage in fertilizing deep-ploughed plots despite the fact that nutrient availability was somewhat lower on these (Table 4). There was a difference between crops in their response to deep ploughing. Oats showed a positive yield response of 12 %, while potatoes showed a negative yield response of 10 % (Fig. 3). The effect of incorporating 500 m 3 /ha raw bark into the <b>topsoil</b> after <b>ploughing</b> to 50 cm was investigated on one site (Vinberga). After an initial year of very low yield, this treatment gave a large positive effects on yield, presumably as a result of improved soil structure. It was concluded from this series of experiments that deep ploughing was not an economically justifiable soil improvement treatment, since better and more consistent results could be obtained by fertilizing combined with normal ploughing. In very dry areas or on coarse sands water availability could be improved more reliably by irrigating than by deep ploughing...|$|R
40|$|The soil pore {{network and}} marcoporosity are {{important}} factors affecting water and solute transport. The transfer of contaminants to water resources {{is of particular}} importance in the Valle de Bravo watershed as it provides 10 % of the drinking water for the 20 million inhabitants of Mexico City. This watershed is composed mainly of Andosols with unique mineralogical and physical characteristics. Soil porosity is usually examined on thin sections, using various image analysis techniques. We propose a novel methodology combining image analysis and a displacement experiment to study relationships between soil structure and water tracer transport parameters. (H 2 O) -O- 18 displacement experiments were conducted through intact soil columns sampled at three depths from a representative cultivated Andosol profile. The soil structure and pore characteristics were obtained by image analysis on thin sections obtained from each column {{at the end of}} the displacement experiment. The total 2 D porosity (for pores larger than 50 mu m) varied from 80 % of the total section area in the topsoil to around 60 % in the subsoil. Tubular pores were the most abundant in the soil profile, but <b>ploughing</b> of the <b>topsoil</b> had destroyed sections of these pores and replaced them with packing pores. Water transport in the intact subsoil columns was always in physical non-equilibrium, showing the existence of preferential flow pathways. In the topsoil, one column out of three showed no preferential flow, demonstrating that soil ploughing also homogenised pore connections. Pore connectivity was larger in the <b>ploughed</b> <b>topsoil</b> than in their deeper soil horizon counterparts. Our methodology offers a 2 D quantitative characterisation of the macroporous network at 50 mu m resolution and the determination of water transport parameters on the same intact soil samples. 3 D characterisation of soil porosity using X-ray computed tomography (CT) gives a better picture of pore connection but usually has lower spatial resolution and a larger cost...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} was initiated in 1997 with non-inverting soil tillage compared to conventional tillage with annual mouldboard ploughing to either 20 cm depth (CT) or 10 cm depth (RCT). The new system included a non-inverting mechanical loosening {{of the soil}} to approximately 35 cm depth combined with a shallow cultivation of the top 5 cm soil by either a rotovator (NIT) or an S-tine harrow (RNIT). The experiment was located on a sandy loam at the organic farmed Rugballegård Experimental Station. A plough pan at 20 - 35 cm depth was identified by cone penetration measurements. The non-inverting tillage system succeeded in breaking up the plough pan, which reduced the cone index from approximately 1. 8 MPa in the CT and RCT treatments to 0. 6 MPa in the NIT treatment. A detailed soil profile description of the top 30 cm of the soil indicated that root growth was restricted for especially CT and RCT treatments in the form of thickened and horizontally deflected roots at the interface between the <b>topsoil</b> and the <b>plough</b> pan at approximately 22 cm depth. For RCT a new plough pan was under development just below the present ploughing depth at 10 cm. This also resulted in root growth restriction, but to a lesser extent than the deeper plough pan. A soil drop test was performed to characterise soil fragmentation. Undisturbed cubic soil samples were taken from the 5 - 15 cm layer and dropped from 75 cm height in to a metal box. The resulting aggregate size distribution differed between the treatments with geometrical mean weight diameter (GMD) of 5. 7 mm 7. 4 mm and 8. 9 mm for CT, RCT and NIT treatments, respectively. The higher degree of fragmentation for the mouldboard ploughed soil may be explained by higher energy input per soil volume by mouldboard ploughing than by non-inverting deep loosening. The results indicate for the 5 _ 15 cm layer, that plant growth conditions were best for CT treated soil, due to a combination of low cone index and small aggregates. For the 20 _ 35 cm layer, the results indicates best plant growth conditions for NIT treated soil due to a low cone index and less restricted root growth. The spring barley/pea mix with grass/clover undersown yielded on average 47. 6 hkg/ha. There {{were no significant differences between}} treatments...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{choice of}} {{cultivation}} system in arable agriculture exerts {{a strong influence}} not only on soil health and crop productivity {{but also on the}} wider environment. Conservation tillage using non-inversion methods conserves soil carbon, reduces erosion risk and enhances soil quality. In addition, conservation tillage has been shown to sequester more carbon within the soil than inversion tillage, reducing carbon dioxide losses to the atmosphere. Stable, well structured topsoils that develop following long-term conservation tillage lead to more energy efficient systems due to the reduced power requirements for cultivation. Long-term experiments, e. g. more than 20 years, that confirm the impact of conservation tillage over an extended period are not common. Here we evaluate the impact of different tillage methods and winter wheat straw management, either incorporated or removed, on organic matter turnover and soil quality indicators. No-till, chisel and mouldboard ploughing was carried out for 23 years on a silty clay loam soil in South West England that was not considered suitable for non-inversion tillage due to weak soil structure. In order to assess the effect of contrasting cultivation and straw disposal method on soil carbon dynamics, a range of assays were conducted, including water extractable organic carbon, hot water extractable carbohydrate, microbial biomass carbon, activity of β-glucosidase and acid phosphatase enzymes, C sequestration and the natural abundance of 13 C. Our results show that the soil organic carbon concentration in the topsoil was greater under no-till than mouldboard ploughing, while a reverse trend was observed in the lower depths. A 14 - 17 % increase in soil organic carbon was observed in the <b>topsoil</b> for chisel <b>plough</b> and no-till treatments compared to mouldboard ploughing.

40|$|RECONDES is {{a three-year}} EU-funded project, which focus is to {{mitigate}} desertification processes {{by means of}} innovative techniques using vegetation in specific landscape configurations prone to severe degradation processes. One of the research themes {{is the impact of}} desertification on abandoned land and potential mitigation practices. Land abandonment is nowadays widely spread in Spain and is expected to increase. Previous research showed that gully erosion was higher on abandoned fields compared to similar cultivated fields. Especially fields that are terraced or have earth dams are prone to gully erosion after abandonment, due to restoration of the natural drainage pattern and piping in case of dispersive substrate. Main cause of increased erosion is the absence of ploughing and a low vegetation recovery, which results in sealing crusts and bare spots with low infiltration rates leading to more runoff and finally gully erosion. The objective of this paper was to analyse the consequences of land abandonment on erosion and to provide effective eco-engineering techniques for mitigation of gully erosion. The study was carried out in the Carcavo basin, a semi-arid catchment in Southeast Spain. At catchment scale all abandoned fields were surveyed and characteristics of each field, gullies and terrace failures were described. One abandoned valley was surveyed at a more detailed scale to create a precise DTM and detailed aerial photographs were taken to study vegetation patterns. The results reveal that gullies on abandoned fields are often located on critical positions at the transition of the hillslope to the channel. This means that when a gully becomes active the connectivity of runoff and sediment in the landscape increases considerably, with the negative off-site effects as a consequence. A reconstruction of eroded sediment from the DTM confirms the importance of gully erosion in terms of sediment losses. Overflow at the lowest point and piping seem to be the main causes of terrace failure. Especially the influence of piping increases in dispersive soils after abandonment, because the <b>topsoil</b> is not <b>ploughed</b> anymore and runoff can enter directly the subsoil through cracks and macro-pores that have been developed after abandonment. Two potential soil and water conservation practices are: (1) Maintenance of terraces and earth dams, as a result more water is retained, which increases the vegetation cover and that strengthens the terrace or earth dam. Only in dispersive soils the risk of piping remains. (2) Revegetation on critical spots in the landscape with indigenous species that grow fast and have dense rooting systems to bind the soil...|$|R
