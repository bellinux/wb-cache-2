5|$|Many of {{the most}} legendary music venues in Baltimore have been shut down, {{including}} most of the shops, churches, bars and other destinations on the legendary Pennsylvania Avenue, center for the city's jazz scene. The Royal Theater, {{once one of the}} premiere destinations for African American performers on the East Coast, is marked only by a simple plaque, the theater itself having been demolished in 1971. A statue of Billie Holiday remains on Pennsylvania Avenue, however, between Lafayette and Lanvale, with a plaque that reads I don't think I'm singing. I feel like I am playing a horn. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> improvise. What comes out is what I feel.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

Subsequently, <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> evaluate the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality {{to see the}} neoconservative administration’s effects on local administrations based on market-oriented administration rationale. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> explain that the gender discourse was strengthened because of such administration rationale. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> evaluate this matter profoundly.
