Nine sampling gaps at Castanopsis kawakamii Natural Reserve Forest, Sanming City, China were divided into three sizes (small, medium and large). The micro-environments viz. soil temperature at 0, 5 and 10 cm depth, air temperature, light intensity, and air relative humidity were recorded for the entire gap area in every 2 hours interval from 8 am to 6 pm. The results showed time-dependent variations for these variables. In each <b>gap</b> <b>size,</b> the maximum light intensity was recorded at 10 am to 2 pm at the center of the gap, which was higher at the north and west directions than south and east directions, except for the north direction in large <b>gap</b> <b>size.</b> Light intensity has a significant positive correlation with soil temperature compared with that under canopy.

The rotor-stator interaction in a (1 / 2) -stage turbine is simulated by solving the quasi-three-dimensional unsteady Euler/Navier-Stokes equations using a parallelized numerical algorithm. The reduced turnaround time and cost/MFLOP of the parallel code was crucial to complete the numerous run cases presented in this paper. The inter-row gap effect is evaluated for 4 gaps, 3 radial positions and 3 angular velocities. As expected, the results presented in this paper show that the efficiency increases and losses decrease while the <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> increases. The maximum efficiency location, however, corresponds to values of the <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> which may be too large for practical use (approximately inch).

40|$|International audienceA wear {{map shows}} wear rate as a {{function}} of the grid-to-rod <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> and the frequency of the excitation force. The critical <b>gap</b> <b>size,</b> which is associated with the maximum wear rate, lies within the harmonic regime. In the no wear region the amplitude of the rod vibration is smaller than the <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> so that no impact between the rod and plate can happen. The curve of the resonant frequency of the system appears to overlap with the peaks in the contour. Grid-to-rod fretting (GTRF) wear is a major cause of fuel leaks. Understanding its mechanism is crucial for improving the reliability of nuclear reactors. In this paper we present a three-dimensional, finite-element based approach, which reveals how the wear rate depends on the <b>size</b> of the <b>gap</b> between the grid and the fuel rod, and on the frequency of the excitation force. We show that these two factors affect the dynamic vibration of the rod, which leads to three different regimes: harmonic, period-doubling and chaotic. The wear rate in the harmonic regime is significantly larger than that in the other two regimes, and reaches a maximum when the excitation frequency is close to the resonant frequency of the system, which is dependent on the <b>gap</b> <b>size.</b> We introduce the concept of a critical <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> that gives the maximum wear rate, and we identify the properties and values of this critical <b>gap</b> <b>size.</b> A wear map is developed as a result of a large number of parametric studies.

Montgomery. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 144 pages, appendices A-B. Recent losses of biodiversity in managed forests have invigorated {{the need for}} natural disturbance-based management that sustains the many goods and services expected from forests. Regionally, declines in species diversity of managed northern hardwood forests have prompted the need for alternative approaches to forest management. One approach to natural disturbance-based management is using harvest gaps to emulate natural gaps that result from canopy disturbances. In this dissertation, I examine harvest gaps and their influence on ground-layer plants {{in the context of}} canopy gap theory. With the help of others, I measured four planted tree species and ground-layer vegetation (woody and herbaceous) abundance within a field experiment located in a second-growth northern hardwood forest of northern Wisconsin. The experimental approach included a gap opening gradient (five <b>gap</b> <b>sizes,</b> 6, 10, 20, 30 and 46 m diameter, and undisturbed reference areas) and a temporal gradient (0, 2, 6, and 13 years after gap creation). Ground-layer plant community composition and functional traits differed among <b>gap</b> <b>sizes</b> supporting theory. <b>Gaps</b> of all <b>sizes</b> differed in composition from undisturbed areas and all pair-wise combinations of <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> also differed in composition, except the 6 m and 10 m gaps. Compositional differences in <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> were evident two years after gap creation and grew more pronounced over the 13 year period. Species' functional traits and micro-environments were related to variation in ground-layer composition. The correlation between <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> and ground-layer plant composition provides evidence for gap partitioning by the ground-layer community in this forest. In addition, medium <b>gap</b> <b>sizes</b> were more diverse than smaller or larger gaps, supporting the concept that intermediate disturbances maximize species diversity. Furthermore, survival and growth of planted yellow birch, white pine, red oak, and hemlock seedlings was lower than expected growth and survival based on prior empirical and theoretical results. Growth and survival responses to <b>gap</b> <b>sizes</b> are dampened by deer browsing and shrub competition. This dissertation argues that harvest gaps play a role in plant diversity at multiple scales and provides an ecological framework for management decisions regarding <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> and its relationship to the ground-layer plant community...|$|R

It has been shown that changing the <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> can affect the fundamental frequency of the beam. The bifurcation diagrams for small gap distance revealed that by changing the <b>gap</b> <b>size,</b> the number and type of the fixed points can change. However, for large gap regime, where the Casimir force is the dominant intermolecular force, changing the <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> does not affect the quality of the bifurcation behavior...|$|R
40|$|Histologically, {{secondary}} caries {{is divided}} in an outer lesion on tooth surface and an inner lesion along the cavity {{wall in the}} tooth-restoration-interspace. The outer lesion developes because of primary caries attack while the inner lesion {{is a result of}} microleakage. This theory is controversial because clinical examinations demonstrated that microleakage occures with time but not necessarily in coexistance with secondary caries. In contrast, only cavity walls at very wide gaps generate inner lesions. This leads to the question which relation exists between <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> and secondary caries. Some investigators described a close correlation while others deny this. This contrary results might be because of experimental design. Caries has a multifactorial etiology. Results from chemical in-vitro designs cannot be related to the situation in the oral cavity. It is impossible to assess colonization of the gap with microorganism. However, in vivo it is difficult to produce standardized <b>gap</b> <b>sizes,</b> to measure the inner lesion and to distinguish between secondary and residual caries. Another reason for the conflictive theories of secondary caries might be the simultaneous consideration of outer and inner lesion together. Although the invisible inner lesion is the most interesting part of a secondary caries lesion. The present study conducted in a bacterial-based in vitro caries model aimed to determine whether typical inner lesion can be detected at simulated walls with selected gap widths when the development of outer lesions is inhibited. Using a diamond saw microtome bovine teeth were cut in four blocks and divided in four groups. All specimens were mounted on a vice-like appliance. <b>Gap</b> <b>sizes</b> were adjusted: test group 50 (<b>gap</b> <b>size</b> of 50 µm), test group 100 (<b>gap</b> <b>size</b> of 100 µm), test group 250 (<b>gap</b> <b>size</b> of 250 µm) and control group (<b>gap</b> <b>size</b> of 250 µm). Before the adjustment all test group specimens´ surfaces were covered with an acid resistant nail varnish to avoid an outer lesion. Afterwards the specimen were incubated in a caries model for three weeks. All specimens of the test group with an intact varnish showed exclusively inner (wall) lesions in enamel and dentine. The control group revealed a stronger demineralized inner lesion. A statistically significant increase in lesion area could be detected in enamel between the <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> of 50 and 250 µm and in dentine between 50 and 100 µm. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} inner lesion can develop without outer lesion. Thus, the inner lesion is rather the result of microleakage or of biofilm in the gap than the effect of outer lesion. Although the extent of inner lesion depends mostly on factors like time and oral hygiene, the effect of outer lesion on inner lesion should not be underestimated. This fact could also be demonstrated in the stronger demineralization of inner lesion in the control group compared to the test group. The chosen study design can be a good basis for following examinations, for example the influence of <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> on different resorative materials or preventive treatment options on inner lesion. Clinically an independent assessment of inner and outer lesion is needed. If inner lesion forms without outer lesion, a „hidden caries“ is possible and would need spezial concepts for ist proper detection and treatment. This investigation showed an influence of <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> on inner lesion in vitro but it seems that oral hygiene has a stronger effect on inner lesion. Nowadays oral hygiene became more important in dental practice. The less bacterial load might increase the importance of <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> in the etiology of secondary caries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The flow {{visualizations}} of viscoelastic {{flows in}} the mixing-separating geometry of Cochrane et al. [1] showed provocative flow features {{that inspired the}} current numerical research using the upper-convected Maxwell (UCM) model. The effects of Deborah (De) and Reynolds (Re) numbers and <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> were analyzed in depth in this two-dimensional flow investigation. The normalized <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> was varied between 0 and 5, Re varied between 0 and 50 and De was varied between 0 and the maximum attainable value. The creeping flow of Newtonian fluids is always anti-symmetric, due to the anti-symmetry of the inlet conditions and the symmetry of the flow geometry. The increase in the <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> leads {{to an increase in}} the reversed flow rate ratio (i? ̂), here defined as the ratio between the reversed and total flow rates, an effect enhanced only fori?e> 5. The creeping flow of UCM fluids however, showed two distinct flow patterns. For normalized <b>gap</b> <b>sizes</b> below a critical value the reversed flow is slightly enhanced by viscoelasticity, followed by a strong decrease in Rr towards zero as De further increase, whereas for a supercritical <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> viscoelasticity is responsible for a continuous increase in Rr. For near-critical flow geometries it was possible to observe a sudden jump between the two flow conditions at slightly different Deborah numbers, thus suggesting the possibility to use such geometry as a micro-mixer for viscoelastic fluids if the imposed flow rates are made time periodic to enhance an oscillation between flow patterns. At low Reynolds numbers the dependence of flow pattern on <b>gap</b> <b>size</b> and Deborah number still exhibits the described double behavior, but inertia naturally enhances the straight flow case and at Re = 5, Rr always decreases with Debora...|$|R
