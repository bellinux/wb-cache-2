30|$|To further test {{our client}} {{libraries}} and API, {{we developed a}} group of key applications in various programming languages and frameworks.

40|$|Since code {{revisions}} {{reflect the}} extent of human involvement in the software development process, revision histories reveal the interactions <b>and</b> interfaces between <b>developers</b> <b>and</b> modules. We therefore divide <b>developers</b> <b>and</b> modules into groups according to the revision histories of the open source software repository, for example, sourceforge. net. To describe the interactions in the open source development process, we use a representative model, Legitimate Peripheral Participation (LPP) [6], to divide developers into groups such as core and peripheral teams, based on the evolutionary process of learning behavior. With the conventional module relationship, we divide modules into kernel and non-kernel types (such as UI). In the past, groups of <b>developers</b> <b>and</b> modules have been partitioned naturally with informal criteria. In this work, however, we propose a developer-module relationship model to analyze the grouping structures between <b>developers</b> <b>and</b> modules. Our results show some process cases of relative importance on the constructed graph of project development. The graph reveals certain subtle relationships in the interactions between core <b>and</b> non-core team <b>developers,</b> <b>and</b> the interfaces between kernel and non-kernel modules...|$|R

5|$|Fortress is {{the code}} {{name of a}} {{cancelled}} action role-playing video game that was in development by Grin. Director Ulf Andersson devised the concept for Fortress and pre-production began {{in the second half}} of 2008.

Grin reconceived the game in the recurring Final Fantasy world of Ivalice, and included elements of Final Fantasy XII such as stylistic motifs and character designs; additional elements included chocobos and other recurring creatures from the Final Fantasy series. It was to be released on the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 platforms.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of the production, Atlus staff saw Shin Megami Tensei as a chance to create a game with the company's brand on it. The staff saw it as a remake of the {{previous}} Megami Tensei game; because of this, they {{knew what was going to}} happen in the story, and the development went smoothly. The story went through multiple revisions, and many settings were inspired by the staff's personal lives. The character and demon designs were done by Kazuma Kaneko, who used mythical figures and multiple clothing styles in his designs. Reception and sales for the game have been highly positive, and its success helped launch Atlus as a <b>developer</b> <b>and</b> publisher, along with popularizing the Megami Tensei series.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{a project}} of real estate <b>developer</b> <b>and</b> former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, the {{structure}} was built by Walter Chrysler, {{the head of the}} Chrysler Corporation. The Chrysler Building's construction was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. The building served as the corporation's headquarters from 1930 until the mid-1950s. Although the building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation did not pay for its construction and never owned it, as Walter P. Chrysler decided to pay for it himself, so that his children could inherit it.|$|E
5|$|Overwatch {{announcement}} video, in 2014, {{contained a}} stray {{reference to a}} gauntlet. Following its obsessive popularity with fans, the developer, Blizzard Entertainment, expanded the gauntlet into a full-fledged, playable character. This period included a series of teasers from the <b>developer</b> <b>and</b> a campaign by actor Terry Crews to voice the character. Doomfist was ultimately voiced by Sahr Ngaujah. In Doomfist's fictional backstory, the playable character became the third generation to wield the gauntlet, and {{is presented as a}} villain after killing his predecessor and becoming a leader of Talon, the game's nemesis group. A digital comic accompanied the character's release.|$|E
5|$|Rætikon {{was first}} {{announced}} in July 2013, though its development began in 2011. The game's Viennese <b>developer</b> <b>and</b> publisher, Broken Rules Games, had previously {{worked on the}} 2012 Wii U game Chasing Aurora, which itself {{was based on a}} multiplayer prototype for Rætikon. The game is partly based on an Alps region culture conquered by the Roman Empire. Its visuals were inspired by dream-like flying sensations. In an effort to increase the game's replay value, the developers emphasized its artificial intelligence, physics, and interactive qualities, including animal-specific behaviors and strippable plant foliage.|$|E
