5000|$|Clipping is {{the process}} of {{removing}} primitives that <b>are</b> <b>outside</b> of the view box in order to continue on to the rasterizer stage. Primitives that <b>are</b> <b>outside</b> of the view box are removed or [...] "clipped" [...] away. Once the primitives that <b>are</b> <b>outside</b> of the view box are removed, the primitives that are still inside of the view box will be drawn into new triangles to be proceeded to the next stage.|$|R
5|$|During the {{recovery}} phase intravenous fluids are discontinued {{to prevent a}} state of fluid overload. If fluid overload occurs and vital signs are stable, stopping further fluid may be all that is needed. If a person <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> of the critical phase, a loop diuretic such as furosemide {{may be used to}} eliminate excess fluid from the circulation.|$|E
5|$|The classic {{point in}} polygon test from {{computational}} geometry applies the above ideas. To {{determine if a}} point lies within a polygon, one casts a ray from infinity to the point and counts {{the number of times}} the ray crosses the edge of polygon. The crossing number is even if and only if the point <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> the polygon. This algorithm works because if the ray never crosses the polygon, then its crossing number is zero, which is even, and the point <b>is</b> <b>outside.</b> Every time the ray does cross the polygon, the crossing number alternates between even and odd, and the point at its tip alternates between outside and inside.|$|E
5|$|A granite wall {{surrounds}} the temple, enclosing all its shrines and six of its seven bodies of water. The rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower, is unfinished. A swastika shaped temple tank built in 800 AD by Kamban Araiyan {{during the reign}} of Dantivarman <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> the temple complex. The Vijayanagar and Nayak kings commissioned paintings {{on the walls of the}} shrine of Pudarikakshan, some of which are still present.|$|E

5|$|Above {{the central}} figure shines a single small star {{at the very top}} of the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of {{the central figure}} herself. The {{distance}} of the star from the central figure, and the fact that it <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Although 47 Ursae Majoris b <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> its star's {{habitable}} zone, its {{gravitational influence}} would disrupt {{the orbit of}} planets in the outer part of the habitable zone. In addition, it may have disrupted the formation of terrestrial planets and reduced the delivery of water to any inner planets in the system. Therefore, planets located in the habitable zone of 47 Ursae Majoris {{are likely to be}} small and dry.|$|E
5|$|At the {{southeast}} end of Spring Street is Riverside Drive, which {{provides some of}} the most scenic views of the Ohio River and the eastern Louisville shoreline because of the limited alterations compared to other sections of the Ohio River in the Louisville area. Houseboats are docked along the Ohio River {{on the south side of}} Riverside Drive. The north side of Riverside Drive has a variety of architectural styles and is mostly residential. Unlike the other prominent streets, Riverside drive <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> the flood-wall that surrounds most of the city and was built two feet higher than the height the Ohio River flood of 1937.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Jupiter <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> that of Earth, the phase angle of Jupiter as viewed from Earth never exceeds 11.5°. That is, the planet always appears nearly fully {{illuminated}} when viewed through Earth-based telescopes. It was only during spacecraft missions to Jupiter that crescent views of the planet were obtained. A small telescope will usually show Jupiter's four Galilean moons and the prominent cloud belts across Jupiter's atmosphere. A large telescope will show Jupiter's Great Red Spot when it faces Earth.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine, {{a common}} {{industrial}} chemical, <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> {{the scope of}} the disarmament agreement; however, its use as a poison gas would violate the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined in 2013. Various parties, including Western governments, have accused Assad of conducting illegal chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. A late disclosure in 2014 regarding Syria's ricin program raised doubts about completeness of the government's declaration of its chemical weapons stockpile, and in early May 2015, OPCW announced that inspectors had found traces of sarin and VX nerve agent at a military research site in Syria that had not been declared previously by the Assad regime.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane's own sympathies lie most {{strongly}} with utilitarianism and liberalism; {{his own account}} is most influenced by them. He argues that rights derived from considerations of interests can protect individual animals and place limits on {{what can be done}} to them. These rights cannot be violated, even in the name of the greater good, which means that the cultural and economic practices of human beings will be affected. Anticipating criticism, Cochrane explains that not every interest leads to a right. A full consideration of this argument <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> the scope of the book. The argument was expanded in Cochrane's Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012) which, though published after An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, was based on his doctoral thesis.|$|E

5|$|Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter (stylized as Aliens Ate My Babysitter!) is a side-scrolling {{platform}} {{video game}} developed by id Software {{and published by}} FormGen in December 1991 for MS-DOS. It is the seventh episode of the Commander Keen series, though it is numbered as the sixth, as Commander Keen in Keen Dreams <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> of the main continuity. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, as he journeys through an alien world to rescue his kidnapped babysitter. The game feature Keen running, jumping, and shooting through various levels while opposed by aliens, robots, and other hazards.|$|E
5|$|Many astronomical {{alignments}} {{have been}} claimed for Stonehenge, {{a complex of}} megaliths and earthworks in the Salisbury Plain of England. The most famous {{of these is the}} midsummer alignment, where the Sun rises over the Heel Stone. However, this interpretation has been challenged by some archaeologists who argue that the midwinter alignment, where the viewer <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> Stonehenge and sees the sun setting in the henge, is the more significant alignment, and the midsummer alignment may be a coincidence due to local topography.|$|E
5|$|Ravalomanana's family origins are Merina, the island's {{largest and}} most {{politically}} prominent ethnic group. The Ravalomanana family tomb <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> the historic walls of the village, a placement that would typically indicate the family's origins lie with the hova (commoners' caste), rather than the andriana — the traditional ruling caste among the Merina that continues to exert considerable influence over political affairs in modern Madagascar. His later entry into the political sphere has made the question of his caste background one of popular interest and ongoing debate among the Malagasy public and press. Biographer Vivier (2007) maintains that the Ravalomanana family is andriana in origin.|$|E

5|$|Set {{before the}} events of Thor, Phil Coulson stops {{at a gas station}} on his way to Albuquerque, New Mexico. While Coulson shops for snacks {{in the back of the}} station, two robbers enter and demand the money from the register.

As he is about to turn over the gun, Coulson distracts the robbers and subdues both men in seconds. He then nonchalantly pays for his snacks while subtly advising the clerk not to mention his involvement to the police and leaves the station.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario RPG {{contains}} token {{similarities to}} other Square-developed video games, such as the Final Fantasy series, along with a story and gameplay based on the Super Mario Bros. series of platform games. Like most traditional JRPGs, {{there are two main}} sections to the game: adventuring and turn-based battle sequences. Much of Super Mario RPGs gameplay <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> monster battles and plays like an isometric 3D platformer, in which traditional Mario elements such as punching floating question blocks from below are prominent. There are no random encounters and as such enemies are visible in the field; a battle ensues only if Mario comes in contact with one. This allows the player to evade unnecessary battles.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottom end}} {{of the body is}} an ampulla (a flask-like swelling), which anchors the animal in the tube and enables it to retract its body very quickly when threatened. When the lophophore is {{extended}} {{at the top of the}} body, cilia (little hairs) on the sides of the tentacles draw food particles to the mouth, which is inside and slightly to one side of the base of the lophophore. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing a lid above the mouth or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The food then moves down to the stomach, which is in the ampulla. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E
