25|$|In 389, the Former Qin emperor Fu Deng, to whom Qifu Guoren had {{nominally}} submitted as a vassal, created Qifu <b>Gangui</b> the Prince of Jincheng—a {{title that}} signified less dominion than his original title of Prince of Henan, because Jincheng Commandery only roughly corresponded to modern Lanzhou—but Qifu <b>Gangui</b> accepted the title.|$|E
25|$|In 393, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> {{created his}} son Qifu Chipan as crown prince.|$|E
25|$|In 400, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> {{moved his}} capital from Xicheng to Wanchuan (苑川, also in Baiyin).|$|E
25|$|Qifu <b>Gangui</b> {{was known}} for using {{military}} strategies designed to expose weaknesses and to mislead enemies into acting in an overly dangerous manner, and then strike when the enemy became overconfident.|$|E
25|$|In 403, Lü Long {{decided to}} give up his state (now {{consisting}} of little more than the capital city of Guzang) to Later Qin, ending Later Liang, and Qifu <b>Gangui</b> was one of the generals whom Yao Xing sent to escort Lü Long to Chang'an and to escort his replacement, the Later Qin general Wang Shang (王尚) to Guzang, which was at the point effectively surrounded by Southern Liang and Northern Liang forces.|$|E
2500|$|In 397, {{determined}} to punish Qifu <b>Gangui,</b> Lü Guang launched a major attack against Xicheng [...] This frightened Qifu Gangui's officials {{enough that they}} recommended a retreat to Chengji (成紀, in modern Tianshui, Gansu) to the east, but Qifu <b>Gangui,</b> seeing weaknesses in Later Liang's forces despite their numbers, stood his ground. Later Liang forces were initially successful, capturing several major Western Qin cities, but Qifu <b>Gangui</b> tricked Lü Guang's brother and major general Lü Yan (呂延) the Duke of Tianshui into believing that he was retreating, and Lü Yan fell into a trap Qifu <b>Gangui</b> set and was killed. Lü Guang, in fear, withdrew to his capital Guzang (姑臧, in modern Wuwei, Gansu). [...] In 398, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> sent Qifu Yizhou to attack Later Liang, and he recovered some of the territory previously lost.|$|E
2500|$|In 391, Qifu Gangui's general Yuezhi Jiegui (越質詰歸) rebelled, {{but after}} Qifu <b>Gangui</b> {{personally}} led an army against him, Yuezhi surrendered—and Qifu <b>Gangui</b> married {{the daughter of}} a clansman to Yuezhi, showing Qifu Gangui's tendency to try to personally connect with tribal chiefs to get them to submit to him. [...] However, later 391, the strategy could have said to have backfired as the tribal chief Mo Yigan (沒奕干) initially submitted and sent two sons as hostages to him, seeking his aid in a campaign against another tribal chief, Da Dou (大兜). [...] Qifu <b>Gangui</b> aided him and defeated Da in battle, and then sent Mo's sons back to him, to try to get Mo to be more grateful of him. [...] However, Mo instead turned against Qifu <b>Gangui</b> and aligned himself with the Xiongnu chief Liu Weichen (劉衛辰), and Qifu <b>Gangui,</b> in anger, attacked Mo and, in battle, fired an arrow that struck Mo's eye. [...] During the campaign against Mo, however, Lü Guang the prince of Later Liang took this opportunity to attack Western Qin, forcing Qifu <b>Gangui</b> to withdraw to face him. [...] This incident appeared to start several years of intermittent battles between Western Qin and Later Liang.|$|E
2500|$|In 408, {{believing that}} Later Qin was growing weaker, {{he built a}} castle at Kanglang Mountain (嵻崀山, in modern Lanzhou, Gansu) to both prepare to defend himself against Later Qin's enemies and against a {{potential}} Later Qin campaign against him. [...] In 409, he captured Fuhan from the Later Qin rebel Peng Xi'nian (彭奚念) and secretly sent messengers to inform Qifu <b>Gangui</b> of this. [...] Qifu <b>Gangui,</b> who was then attending Yao Xing at Pingliang (平涼, in modern Pingliang, Gansu), then escaped and fled back to Yuanchuan to join him. [...] Soon, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> moved his home base to Dujianshan (度堅山, in modern Baiyin, Gansu) but left Qifu Chipan in command of Fuhan. [...] Late that year, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> redeclared independence with the title Prince of Qin, and he created Qifu Chipan crown prince again.|$|E
2500|$|Fu Deng's son Fu Chong fled to Huangzhong (湟中, {{in modern}} Xining, Qinghai), then under Qifu Gangui's control, and claimed {{imperial}} title. [...] However, in winter 394, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> expelled him, and he fled {{to one of}} his father's last remaining generals, Yang Ding (楊定) the Prince of Longxi. Yang led his forces to join Fu Chong's to attack Qifu <b>Gangui.</b> Qifu <b>Gangui</b> sent Qifu Yizhou and two other generals, Qifu Ketan (乞伏軻彈) and Yuezhi Jiegui against Yang and Fu Chong, and Yang was initially successful against Qifu Yizhou. However, the three Western Qin generals then counterattacked and killed Yang and Fu Chong in battle.|$|E
2500|$|In 394, {{after the}} death of the Later Qin emperor Yao Chang, Fu Deng {{prepared}} a major offensive against Yao Chang's son and successor Yao Xing, and as part of the preparation he requested aid from Qifu <b>Gangui</b> and created Qifu <b>Gangui</b> the Prince of Henan and bestowed on him the nine bestowments. [...] However, Fu Deng's campaign ended in failure, as his forces were defeated by Yao Xing's, and his brother Fu Guang (苻廣) and son Fu Chong abandoned his bases, forcing him to flee into the mountains. [...] He then married his sister the Princess Dongping to Qifu <b>Gangui</b> as his princess and created him the Prince of Liang. [...] Qifu <b>Gangui</b> sent his brother Qifu Yizhou (乞伏益州) to aid Fu Deng, but as Fu Deng came out of the mountains to join Qifu Yizhou's forces, Yao Xing ambushed and captured him, and then executed him. [...] Qifu Yizhou then withdrew.|$|E
2500|$|In summer 400, Later Qin's general, Yao Xing's uncle Yao Shuode (姚碩德) {{launched}} a major attack against Western Qin. [...] Initially, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> {{was successful in}} cutting off Yao Shuode's supply line, but Yao Xing then personally came to Yao Shuode's aid. [...] Qifu <b>Gangui</b> divided his army to try to ascertain Later Qin's intentions, but the armies lost communication in the fog, and Later Qin attacked them and greatly defeated them, taking nearly the entire Western Qin army captive. [...] Yao Xing advanced to Fuhan (枹罕, in modern Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu), forcing Qifu <b>Gangui</b> to flee back to Jincheng. [...] With his army lost, however, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> concluded {{that he could not}} sustain a state any more, and instructed his officials to surrender to Later Qin, while he himself surrendered to Southern Liang's prince Tufa Lilugu, who welcomed him as an honored guest. [...] Tufa Lilugu's brother Tufa Juyan (禿髮俱延) suspected Qifu Gangui's intentions, and suggested that Tufa Lilugu exile him to the Yifu (乙弗) tribe (probably west of the Qinghai Lake), a suggestion that Tufa Lilugu rejected. [...] However, worried that Qifu <b>Gangui</b> would try to reestablish his state, he sent an army to watch over him. [...] Qifu <b>Gangui,</b> fearing that he would be executed, then regained trust from Tufa Lilugu by sending Qifu Chipan, his brothers, and their mother to the Southern Liang capital Xiping as hostages. [...] He himself, however, as soon as the Southern Liang guard was down, fled to Fuhan and surrendered to Later Qin.|$|E
2500|$|In fall 395, Lü Guang {{made a major}} {{attack on}} Western Qin. [...] Under {{the advice of his}} {{officials}} Mi Guizhou (密貴周) and Mozhe Gudi (莫者羖羝), Qifu <b>Gangui</b> submitted to Lü Guang as a vassal and sent his son Qifu Chibo (乞伏敕勃) as a hostage to Lü Guang, and Lü Guang withdrew. [...] However, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> soon regretted this arrangement and executed Mi and Mozhe.|$|E
2500|$|In 400, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> {{suffered}} a major defeat {{at the hands}} of the Later Qin emperor Yao Xing, and most of his state was seized by Later Qin. [...] Qifu <b>Gangui</b> concluded that he could not sustain a state any more, and instructed his officials to surrender to Later Qin, while he himself surrendered to Southern Liang's prince Tufa Lilugu, who welcomed him as an honored guest. Tufa Lilugu's brother Tufa Juyan (禿髮俱延) suspected Qifu Gangui's intentions, and suggested that Tufa Lilugu exile him to the Yifu (乙弗) tribe (probably west of the Qinghai Lake), a suggestion that Tufa Lilugu rejected. However, worried that Qifu <b>Gangui</b> would try to reestablish his state, he sent an army to watch over him. Qifu <b>Gangui,</b> fearing that he would be executed, then regained trust from Tufa Lilugu by sending Qifu Chipan, his brothers, and their mother to the Southern Liang capital Xiping as hostages. He himself, however, as soon as the Southern Liang guard was down, fled to Fuhan (枹罕, in modern Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu) and surrendered to Later Qin.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{reference}} to Qifu <b>Gangui</b> in history was in 385, when his brother Qifu Guoren declared himself Chanyu and changed era name, thus signifying independence from Former Qin. [...] At that time, Qifu Guoren named Qifu <b>Gangui</b> a major general. [...] Nothing else {{is known about}} his life before or during Qifu Guoren's reign, other than an implied reference that he defeated the Former Qin general Wang Guang (王廣) in battle.|$|E
2500|$|In 411, Qifu <b>Gangui,</b> {{after some}} campaigns against Later Qin, agreed to {{nominally}} resubmit as a vassal, and Yao Xing created him the Prince of Henan and Qifu Chipan the Duke of Pingchang. [...] Later that year, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> sent Qifu Chipan {{and his brother}} Qifu Shenqian (乞伏審虔) on a campaign against Southern Liang, {{and they had a}} major victory over Tufa Rutan's crown prince Tufa Hutai (禿髮虎台), capturing more than 100,000 animals.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{not known}} when Qifu Shipan was born to his father Qifu <b>Gangui,</b> nor is it known for certain who his mother was. [...] However, it appears likely that he was born prior to Western Qin's {{establishment}} by his uncle Qifu Guoren (in 383), because he was Qifu Gangui's oldest son, and it also appears likely {{that his mother was}} Qifu Gangui's wife Queen Bian. [...] In 388, after Qifu Guoren died, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> became prince.|$|E
2500|$|Qifu <b>Gangui</b> {{created his}} wife Lady Bian princess, {{and he also}} {{established}} a governmental structure designed similarly to a Han Chinese governmental structure. [...] Over the next several years, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> {{used a variety of}} military and diplomatic pressure to get the various people around his—including people of Xianbei, Qiang, and Han ethnicities, to submit to him. [...] Later in the year, he moved the capital from Yongshi (勇士城, in modern Lanzhou, Gansu) to Jincheng (also in Lanzhou).|$|E
2500|$|Around the {{new year}} 395, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> claimed the title Prince of Qin—a greater title that implicitly made himself a rival of Later Qin, and the state thus became known in history as Western Qin. [...] In the summer, he sent Qifu Yizhou to attack the unsubmitting Di chief Jiang Ru (姜乳), despite {{warnings}} that Qifu Yizhou had become arrogant from his victories. [...] Qifu Yizhou indeed became unattentive and was defeated by Jiang. [...] Later in the year, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> moved his capital from Jincheng to Xicheng (西城, in modern Baiyin, Gansu).|$|E
2500|$|Around the {{new year}} 407, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> went on an {{official}} visit to Chang'an. [...] Yao Xing, apprehensive about Qifu Gangui's strength and independence, detained him and made him a minister, giving his command to Qifu Chipan.|$|E
2500|$|Later in 398, Qifu Yizhou battled Murong Shipi and {{defeated}} him. [...] Murong Shipi, in fear, sent his son Murong Dangqi (慕容宕豈) as a hostage and sought peace. [...] Qifu <b>Gangui</b> married {{the daughter of}} a clansman to Qifu Dangqi.|$|E
2500|$|In 408, with Tufa Rutan, who had {{previously}} submitted as a Later Qin vassal, acting independently but yet suffering many internal problems, Yao Xing became resolved to destroy Southern Liang, and Qifu <b>Gangui</b> {{was one of the}} generals he sent under the command of his son Yao Bi (姚弼) to try to destroy Southern Liang. [...] However, Yao Bi's campaign resulted in failure, and while Tufa Rutan nominally continued to submit for a time, he soon declared full independence. [...] In 409, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> himself escaped and returned to Wanchuan. [...] Later in the year, he redeclared the Western Qin state with the title Prince of Qin and changed his era name.|$|E
2500|$|Upon Qifu Gangui's {{arrival in}} the Later Qin capital Chang'an, Yao Xing created him the Marquess of Guiyi. [...] In 401, Yao Xing inexplicably gave Qifu <b>Gangui</b> his entire {{captured}} army back to him and had him defend his old capital Wanchuan, effectively putting {{him back in the}} position he had before, but now as a Later Qin vassal. [...] He quickly put his governmental structure back in place, but now with inferior titles to show submission to Later Qin. [...] Later in 401, Yao Xing sent Qifu <b>Gangui</b> to serve as Yao Shuode's assistant in a major campaign against Later Yang's emperor Lü Long (Lü Guang's nephew), forcing Lü Long's submission.|$|E
2500|$|In spring 412, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> {{moved the}} capital to Tanjiao (譚郊, in modern Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu), leaving Qifu Chipan in command of Yuanchuan. [...] In summer 412, while at Tanjiao, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> was assassinated by Qifu Guoren's son Qifu Gongfu (乞伏公府), who also killed more than 10 {{brothers}} of Qifu Chipan. [...] Qifu Gongfu then took up a defense position at Daxia (大夏, in modern Linxia as well). [...] Qifu Chipan sent his brothers Qifu Zhida (乞伏智達) and Qifu Muyigan (乞伏木奕干) to attack Qifu Gongfu, while moving {{the capital to}} Fuhan. [...] Qifu Zhida, meanwhile, defeated Qifu Gongfu and executed him, his sons, and his brother Qifu Achai (乞伏阿柴). [...] Qifu Chipan was now the undisputed heir, and he claimed the title Prince of Henan.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{historical}} {{reference to}} Qifu Chipan was in 393, when Qifu <b>Gangui</b> created Qifu Chipan crown prince. [...] By this point, {{he was already}} described as brave and intelligent, and more capable than his father. [...] He quickly became a key official in his father's administration.|$|E
2500|$|In summer 412, Qifu Guoren's son Qifu Gongfu killed Qifu <b>Gangui</b> in a {{coup and}} also {{killed more than}} 10 of Qifu Gangui's sons. [...] After a short {{campaign}} between Qifu Gongfu and Qifu Chipan, Qifu Chipan succeeded and killed Qifu Gongfu. [...] He took the throne as Prince Wenzhao.|$|E
2500|$|In 390, the khan of Tuyuhun, Murong Shilian (慕容視連), {{submitted}} to Western Qin as a vassal, and Qifu <b>Gangui</b> created him the Prince of Bailan. [...] However, after Murong Shilian died {{later that year}} and was succeeded by his more ambitious son Murong Shipi (慕容視羆), Murong Shipi rejected that title.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the next}} few years, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> {{appeared}} to begin to act more independently again. [...] For example, in 405, apparently without Later Qin sanction, he attacked Murong Dahai (慕容大孩), the khan of Tuyuhun, {{and later in the}} year he battled fellow Later Qin vassal Yang Sheng (楊盛), the ruler of Chouchi.|$|E
2500|$|Qifu <b>Gangui</b> or Qifu Qiangui ( [...] ; died 412), {{formally}} Prince Wuyuan of Henan (河南武元王), was {{a prince}} of the Xianbei state Western Qin. [...] He was a {{brother of the}} founding prince, Qifu Guoren (Prince Xuanlie), who became prince after Qifu Guoren's death in 388 because Qifu Guoren's son Qifu Gongfu (乞伏公府) was considered too young for leadership. [...] He subsequently expanded the state's power and influence, but only to an extent, and in 400 after military losses to Later Qin, his state was annexed by Later Qin and he himself became a Later Qin general. [...] However, after Later Qin was weakened by defeats {{at the hands of}} its rebel general Liu Bobo's Xia state, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> redeclared independence in 409, but ruled only three more years before he was killed by Qifu Gongfu in a coup. [...] His son Qifu Chipan (Prince Wenzhao) defeated Qifu Gongfu and succeeded him as prince.|$|E
2500|$|In 388, Qifu Guoren died. His son Qifu Gongfu was {{considered}} {{too young to}} take over the leadership, and the officials and generals supported Qifu <b>Gangui</b> to succeed Qifu Guoren, with the titles Grand Chanyu and Prince of Henan. [...] (This title does not imply dominion over modern Henan; rather, it signified dominion over the portions of modern Gansu and Qinghai that are south of the Yellow River.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 407, {{concerned}} that Qifu <b>Gangui</b> was becoming {{stronger and more}} difficult to control, Yao Xing detained him while he was visiting Chang'an, and had Qifu Chipan take over his post. [...] Later that year, when Tufa Rutan, who had nominally been a Later Qin vassal, considered renouncing that status, he sent messengers to Qifu Chipan urging him to join the rebellion. [...] Qifu Chipan beheaded Tufa Rutan's messengers and sent their heads to Chang'an.|$|E
2500|$|After his restoration, Qifu <b>Gangui</b> again {{created his}} wife Princess Bian as princess and Qifu Chipan as crown prince, and he {{temporarily}} set his capital at Dujianshan (度堅山, in modern Baiyin, Gansu). [...] In 410, he attacked Later Qin's Jincheng Commandery and captured it, {{and later in}} 410 moved the capital back to Wanchuan. [...] He then captured several more Later Qin commanderies. [...] However, in spring 411, he returned the captured officials to Later Qin and sought peace, offering to again submit as a vassal. [...] Yao Xing created him the Prince of Henan. [...] However, in winter 411 he again captured several Later Qin commanderies. [...] In spring 412, he moved the capital to Tanjiao (譚郊, in modern Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu), and left Qifu Chipan in charge of Wanchuan.|$|E
2500|$|It {{might have}} been around this time that Qifu Chipan married the {{daughter}} of Tufa Lilugu's brother Tufa Rutan, and later, when Qifu Chipan tried to flee to Later Qin to join his father but was captured on the way, Tufa Rutan urged for his life against Tufa Lilugu's initial desire to execute him, and Tufa Lilugu agreed with Tufa Rutan. [...] After Tufa Lilugu died in 402 and was succeeded by Tufa Rutan, Qifu Chipan successfully escaped and fled to his father, who by then had been made a key Later Qin general. [...] Tufa Rutan sent Qifu Chipan's wife and children to him. [...] Qifu <b>Gangui,</b> who was then in control of his old capital Yuanchuan (苑川, in modern Baiyin, Gansu), sent Qifu Chipan to the Later Qin capital Chang'an to visit the emperor Yao Xing, and Yao Xing made him a commandery governor.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{not known}} when Qifu Mumo was born, nor {{is the name of}} his mother known—other than that she was neither his father Qifu Chipan's princess Princess Tufa, nor her sister Consort Tufa. [...] The first {{historical}} reference to him was in 420, when Qifu Chipan created him crown prince—and by that time, he was already a major general, for the historical reference mentioned that he [...] "remained" [...] a general. [...] In 424, his father sent him and his uncle Qifu Muyigan (乞伏木奕干) to attack Northern Liang, and they were victorious. [...] A campaign that Qifu Mumo carried out with his father against Northern Liang in 426 would be far more disastrous, however, as the Northern Liang prince Juqu Mengxun not only repelled their attacks but persuaded the Xia emperor Helian Chang to attack Western Qin's capital Fuhan (枹罕, in modern Linxia, Gansu). [...] Helian Chang, in response, sent his general Hulu Gu (呼盧古) to attack Wanchuan (苑川, in modern Baiyin, Gansu) and Wei Fa (韋伐) to attack Nan'an (南安, in modern Dingxi, Gansu), and while Western Qin was able to hold Wanchuan, Nan'an fell, at great loss. [...] In winter 426, Xia forces commanded by Hulu and Wei attacked Fuhan, forcing Qifu <b>Gangui</b> to move the capital to Dinglian (定連, also in Linxia), and Hulu and Wei then captured another important Western Qin city, Xiping (西平, in modern Xining, Qinghai), and while they then withdrew, Western Qin had been dealt a major blow.|$|E
50|$|In 407, {{believing that}} Qifu <b>Gangui</b> was {{becoming}} difficult to control, when Qifu <b>Gangui</b> arrived in Chang'an for an official visit, he detained Qifu <b>Gangui</b> to be a civilian official, while giving command of Qifu Gangui's army to Qifu Gangui's heir apparent, Qifu Chipan.|$|E
5000|$|In 397, {{determined}} to punish Qifu <b>Gangui,</b> Lü Guang launched a major attack against Xicheng [...] This frightened Qifu Gangui's officials {{enough that they}} recommended a retreat to Chengji (成紀, in modern Tianshui, Gansu) to the east, but Qifu <b>Gangui,</b> seeing weaknesses in Later Liang's forces despite their numbers, stood his ground.
