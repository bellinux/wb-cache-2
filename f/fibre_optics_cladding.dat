Recently, fluorine-doped <b>fibre</b> <b>optics</b> were shown to be radiation resistant up to 10 19 n/cm 2. A micro-photo multiplier is being developed using a lithography technique for <b>fibre</b> <b>optics</b> of 100 µm diameter. Resonance ionisation spectroscopy through laser is applied to the detection of fission fragments. Preliminary experiments concerning Xe-isotope detection of the tag gas FFD system are considered, as is the sophisticated concept of reactor control by laser.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the most important}} types of distortions in <b>fibre</b> <b>optics</b> during transmission. They are divided into two main groups, linear and nonlinear. The linear phenomena consist of internal and external attenuation, different kinds of dispersions and negative effect of signal noise. The special {{attention is focused on}} polarization mode dispersion. The impact of the nonlinear phenomena on <b>fibre</b> <b>optics</b> in high date rate is discussed as well. Furthermore, the negative effects in <b>fibre</b> <b>optics</b> and their causes are deeply analyzed on results gathered from simulation of some transmission lines. There are presented many methods for counting the meaning of polarization mode dispersion, for example the theoretical model including implementation on physical layer and reducing power looses.

40|$|<b>Fibre</b> <b>optics</b> is {{the best}} way of {{communication}} ever found. It has huge bandwidth's capability often considered as unlimited. We can not use the full potential of <b>fibre</b> <b>optics</b> because there are lots of disturbance appearing at the output of an optical link. Lengths of the fibre and the type of fibre, multimode or single mode, are parameters that change attenuations. To counter these attenuations algorithms has been developed. Recently, a new type of modulation, part of the Partial Response family, has been used in <b>fibre</b> <b>optics.</b> Despite improvements by using this new modulation form we have not use the full potential of these communication systems yet. Furthermore, modulation is still done by electric filter, this conversion from electric to optical is the key to increase data rate of optical transmissions. This paper discusses results obtained and it presents options of creating an all optical equalizer using two different PR targets: EPR 4 and E 3 PR 4.
