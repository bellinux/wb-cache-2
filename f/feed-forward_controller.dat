25|$|For example, in most {{motion control}} systems, {{in order to}} {{accelerate}} a mechanical load under control, more force is required from the actuator. If a velocity loop PID controller {{is being used to}} control the speed of the load and command the force being applied by the actuator, then it is beneficial to take the desired instantaneous acceleration, scale that value appropriately and add it to the output of the PID velocity loop controller. This means that whenever the load is being accelerated or decelerated, a proportional amount of force is commanded from the actuator regardless of the feedback value. The PID loop in this situation uses the feedback information to change the combined output to reduce the remaining difference between the process setpoint and the feedback value. Working together, the combined open-loop <b>feed-forward</b> <b>controller</b> and closed-loop PID controller can provide a more responsive control system.|$|E

To meet the higher and stricter challenges and demands, advanced manufacturing paradigms such as flexible manufacturing and reconfigurable manufacturing {{are widely used}} by manufacturers to perform complex manufacturing operations. Complex manufacturing {{is characterized by a}} diverse product mix, various sources of disturbances, a large number of operations and stations, and the inevitable complex interactions among stations, and between processes and products. This dissertation deals with modeling and process control to enhance product quality produced in complex manufacturing processes, including multistage manufacturing processes. The successful deployment of these techniques will lead to new levels of quality and robustness in manufacturing. Fundamental research has been conducted on active control of multistage manufacturing systems. This includes three topics related to control and modeling, which are: o	Development of <b>feed-forward</b> <b>controllers</b> for manufacturing processes: <b>Feed-forward</b> <b>controllers</b> allow deviation compensation on a part-by-part basis using programmable tools. The control actions take into consideration not only process mathematical models and in-line measurements, but also the modeling and measurement uncertainties. Simulation results show that the proposed control approach is effective in variation reduction, both for a data-driven model and for an engineering-driven model. o	Stream of Variation (SoV) Modeling with consideration of model uncertainties: To model the variation propagation and model changes in Multistage Manufacturing Processes (MMPs) for control purposes, it is necessary for the model to capture the impact of model uncertainties that are due to the errors of incoming parts or errors arising from other process variations. This development of a modeling method considering model uncertainties enables the development of the above-mentioned control strategy. o	Model and controllability validation in real multistage manufacturing processes: As the theoretical basis for model-based predictive controls and many other applications in multistage manufacturing, the SoV model is validated in real manufacturing processes.

The resonant frequency of the device is tuned to the dominant frequency of the incoming wave spectrum by adjusting the PTO damping force, considered the controlled variable. The torque supplied by a generator acts as the control input, with the piston driving the PTO representing a disturbance. Adaptive tuning strategies require high performance actuator control to realise the benefits of optimisation; the work presented here utilises proportional-integral-plus (PIP) control. In their simplest form, PIP controllers cannot account for the interconnected system variables present in the PTO simulation, resulting in relatively poor performance. Therefore, previous research has considered several feed-forward forms of PIP control, in which disturbance is utilised as a measured variable. Although <b>feed-forward</b> <b>controllers</b> offer improved disturbance rejection over standard PIP controllers, when the disturbance signal is sufficiently far from the operating level upon which the controller is based, the response to disturbances deteriorates.
