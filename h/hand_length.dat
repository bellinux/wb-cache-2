40|$|Determining {{internal}} <b>hand</b> link <b>lengths</b> accurately {{is necessary}} in hand modeling {{for the application of}} ergonomic design and evaluation in virtual environment. Misconceived or cursory estimation of <b>hand</b> link <b>lengths</b> is however not rare in literature or practice. This article describes an optimization method for deriving <b>hand</b> link <b>lengths</b> from measured surface maker data. The method employs an optimization routine which minimizes the variations of <b>hand</b> link <b>length</b> and the depth from surface marker to joint center simultaneously during the hand grasping motion. To test the proposed method, an experiment was conducted, in which a 3 D optoelectronic motion capture system was utilized to measure hand and finger positions of 18 male participants for grasping two different cylinders. The grand mean of the Root-mean-square (RMS) differences between link lengths estimated by the proposed method for larger cylinder (d = 50 mm) and smaller cylinder (d = 30 mm) was 1. 7 mm. The grand mean of RMS differences between link lengths estimated by the proposed method and regression method of Buchholz et al. (1992) was 3. 0 mm. The grand mean of RMS differences between estimated wrist-to-fingertip (WTF) lengths by the proposed method and calculated WTF lengths by motion data was 4. 7 mm, which was smaller than the grand mean of RMS differences of WTF lengths estimated by the regression method (9. 1 mm). The proposed optimization method can estimate <b>hand</b> link <b>lengths</b> based on surface measurements and be utilized in human hand modeling required in the fields such as ergonomics, medical science...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Stature is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} important parameters for personal identification. So, Stature reconstruction is important as it provides forensic anthropological estimation of the height of a person in the living state which plays a vital role in the identification of individual remains. Aim: The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the association of <b>hand</b> <b>length</b> with height and to show if height could be predicted using <b>hand</b> <b>length</b> measurements in students of SKIMS Medical college. Methodology: The study of the anthropometric characteristics of 100 Medical College students of ages between 18 - 23 years of SKIMS Medical college, bemina with no obvious deformities or previous history of trauma to the spine or hand was undertaken. The study of these medical students, males (n= 50) & females (n= 50) was investigated. The anthropometric characteristics of their height and <b>hand</b> <b>length</b> were measured, analysed statistically for any significant difference, and correlation between the parameters studied. Results: The results show some significant differences between the anthropometric parameters Pearson’s correlation analysis was used and showed a strong positive correlation, which means that high X variable scores go with high Y variable scores. (R is 0. 8229) and significant. Results from the present study show that there was a positive correlation between height and <b>hand</b> <b>length</b> indicating that height could be predicted using <b>hand</b> <b>length.</b> Conclusion: As age groups increase the mean length of hand also increase, so there is direct relation between length of hand and age groups. Definite proportion also exists between the height and <b>hand</b> <b>length</b> in an individual at all ages, irrespective of the sex. Height of an individual is 9 times the height of <b>hand</b> <b>length.</b> Thus we can predict height from <b>hand</b> <b>length</b> when it is difficult or not possible to measure height directly. ...|$|E

40|$|Estimation of stature is an {{important}} issue, which is significantly considered in forensic anthropology. It {{will be difficult to}} predict the identification of an individual when only some parts of dead body are discovered following disasters or criminal events. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the relationship between stature and upper limb and <b>hand</b> <b>length</b> in Iranian adults to generate regression formulae for stature estimation. Three anthropometric measurements; Stature, Upper Limb Length (ULL) and <b>Hand</b> <b>Length</b> (HL) were taken on subjects, comprising 142 male students (18 - 25 years) using standard measuring instruments. The data were analysed using SPSS 16. Then linear regression models were used to estimate stature. The results indicated a positive correlation between stature and upper limb and hand measurements. The correlation coefficient with upper limb length was r= 0. 89 & p = 0. 0001 and with <b>hand</b> <b>length</b> was r= 0. 78 & p = 0. 0001.
