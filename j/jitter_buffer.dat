If the terminal is sending data to the gateway, and the gateway’s clock is too slow, the buffers (jitter buffers) in the gateway will eventually overflow, causing the transaction to fail.

40|$|When {{a shared}} channel or packet {{switched}} network is used for transmission (e. g. WLAN, HSPA (Turbo- 3 G), LTE (4 G)), it introduces variance in the delay of packets. Thisvariance is called jitter. This jitter can lead to significant degradation of quality inreal-time services {{if it is not}} properly handled. High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) is an extension to the third Generation W-CDMAcellular network that provides significantly increased bandwidth and network capacity byintroducing a High Speed-Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) for downlink and anEnhanced-Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) for uplink. Both HS-DSCH and E-DCH usere-transmissions in order to ensure a low block error rate, as a result jitter is induced inboth channels. Moreover, HS-DSCH also uses channel dependent scheduling betweenusers adding additional jitter. Since HSPA uses IP and the voice service is provided by voice over IP (VoIP), jittermanagement is performed at the destination end-point. However, 3 GPP has also specifiedtransportation of circuit switched voice over HSPA (CSoHS), where jitter managementneeds to be performed separately, at both the entry point to the core network and in thereceiving end-point as jitter is introduced both in the uplink and downlink. This report studies CSoHS, with a focus on its delay and jitter characteristics. Itintroduces two schemes for jitter management: a fixed <b>jitter</b> <b>buffer</b> and an adaptive jitterbuffer.

40|$|Abstract—Over the years, {{the quality}} in Voice over IP (VoIP) {{applications}} {{has been defined}} {{from the perspective of}} VoIP service providers but not necessarily from the perspective of end-users. Conversational quality as perceived by end-users is affected by a wide variety of factors that are not exclusive to network performance. While service providers focus their efforts on Quality of Service (QoS) in VoIP, end-users expect improvement in Quality of Experience (QoE). The measurement of QoE is significantly challenging due to the diverse nature of factors that collectively determine QoE. It is highly desired to have a more comprehensive and accurate quality measurement model that can provide objective measurement of QoS in real-time while simultaneously offering QoE measurement as well. Thus, unveiling the relevance of various factors in a quality measurement model is crucial.

30|$|There {{are three}} factors {{associated}} with packet networks that {{have a significant impact}} on perceived speech quality: delay, jitter (variations in packet arrival times), and packet loss. All three factors stem from the nature of a packet network, which provides no guarantee that a packet of speech data will arrive at the receiving end in time, or even that it will arrive at all [6]. Packet losses can occur both in routers in the network or at the end point when packets arrive too late to be played out. To account for these factors and to ensure a continuous decoding of packets, a <b>jitter</b> <b>buffer</b> is required at the receiving end. The design trade-off for the <b>jitter</b> <b>buffer</b> is to keep the buffering delay as short as possible while minimizing the number of packets that arrive too late to be used. A large <b>jitter</b> <b>buffer</b> causes an increase in the overall delay and decreases the packet loss. A high delay can severely affect the quality and ease of conversation as the wait leads to annoying talker overlap. The ITU-T Recommendation G. 114 [7] states that the one-way delay should be kept below 150 ms for acceptable conversation quality. In practice somewhat larger delays can be tolerated, but in general a latency larger than 300 to 400 ms is deemed unacceptable. A smaller buffer decreases the delay but increases the resulting packet loss. When a packet loss occurs, some mechanism for filling in the missing speech must be incorporated. Such solutions are usually referred to as packet loss concealment (PLC) algorithms, see Kim et al. [8] for a more complete review. This can be done by simply inserting zeros, repeating signals, or by some more sophisticated methods utilizing features of the speech signal, e.g., pitch periods. The result of inserting zeros or repeating packets is choppy speech with highly audible discontinuities perceived as clicks. Pitch-based methods instead try finding periodic segments to repeat in a smooth periodic manner during voiced portions of speech. This typically results in high-quality concealment, even though it may sound robotic and buzzy during events of high packet loss. An example of such a pitch-period-based method is the NetEq [9] algorithm in WebRTC, an open-source platform for audio and video communication over the web [10]. NetEq is continuously adapting the playout timescale by adding or reducing pitch periods to not only conceal lost segments but also to reduce built-up delay in the <b>jitter</b> <b>buffer.</b>|$|E
