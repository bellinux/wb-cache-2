40|$|In {{this paper}} we study <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{connections}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top executives (Presidents, CEOs and General Managers) of Italian banks on their turnover and on bank performance. We measure managers’ connections by the kilometer distance between <b>the</b> province <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bank's headquarter and <b>the</b> manager's province <b>of</b> birth. We show that top managers {{tend to be}} local {{in the sense that}} <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> this distance is heavily skewed towards zero. On <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> this evidence we investigate whether connections affect <b>the</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> at <b>the</b> bank, and whether connections entrench managers at <b>the</b> expense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bank's performance. We find that connections generally decrease <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> bank manager’s turnover, and that <b>the</b> positive effect <b>of</b> performance on tenure is strongly attenuated once connections are taken into account. Furthermore we find that for any bank type performance does not increase with connections. On the contrary, we show that having connected managers hurts performance in Mutual, Cooperative and Rural banks. Overall these findings suggest that connections are collusion devices to share and maintain rents at <b>the</b> expenses <b>of</b> bank performance...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study top {{executive}} turnover in Italian Banks {{over the period}} 1993 - 2001. We relate <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> survival of top executives (Presidents, CEOs and General Managers) to bank performance and the manager’s local connections, controlling for (observable and unobservable) bank and manager characteristics by exploiting longitudinal information on bank-manager <b>appointments.</b> We measure <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> managers’ local connections by the distance between <b>the</b> province <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bank’s headquarters and <b>the</b> manager’s province <b>of</b> birth. We show that top managers tend to be local {{in the sense that}} <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> this distance is heavily skewed towards zero. On <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> this evidence, we address two questions. First, we investigate whether connections affect <b>the</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> at <b>the</b> bank. Second, we ask whether connections entrench managers at <b>the</b> expense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bank’s performance. We find that connections generally increase <b>the</b> probabilities <b>of</b> managers surviving at their banks, and that <b>the</b> positive effect <b>of</b> performance on tenure (as amply documented by the executive turnover literature) disappears once connections are taken into account. On the other hand, we provide evidence against the hypothesis that managerial connections contain information valuable for enhancing a bank’s performance. In particular, we find that highly connected boards cause <b>the</b> shorter survival <b>of</b> banks, and that those who benefit from connections are top managers themselves (mostly Presidents and General Managers). This suggests that connections may be collusion devices with which to maintain and share rents. JEL classification:J 40, J 63, G 21, G 34...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} <b>the</b> {{relative importance}} <b>of</b> {{factors that influence}} patient choice in <b>the</b> booking <b>of</b> general practice appointments for two health problems. Methods: Two discrete choice experiments incorporated into a survey of general practice patients and qualitative methods to support survey development. Results: An overall response of 94 % (1052 / 1123) was achieved. Factors influencing the average respondent's choice of appointment, in order of importance, were: seeing a doctor of choice; booking at a convenient time of day; seeing any available doctor; and having an appointment {{sooner rather than later}} (acute, low worry condition). This finding was the same for an ongoing, high worry condition but in addition <b>the</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> was also <b>of</b> (small) value. Patients traded off speed of access for more convenient appointment times (a willingness to wait an extra 2. 5 – 3 days longer to get a convenient time slot for an acute low worry/ongoing, high worry condition, respectively). However, contrary to expectation, patients were willing to trade off speed of access for continuity of care (e. g. willingness to wait five days longer to see <b>the</b> doctor <b>of</b> their choice for an acute, low worry condition). Preferences varied by a person's gender, work and carer status. Conclusions: Patients hold strong preferences for the way general practice appointment systems are managed. Contrary to current policy on improving access to primary care patients value a more complex mix of factors than fast access at all costs. It is important that policy-makers and practices take note of these preferences...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: In 2000, <b>the</b> Chartered Society <b>of</b> Physiotherapy (CSP) updated {{its core}} {{standards}} for measuring <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interaction between a patient and physiotherapist. Some organisational barriers exist however, in implementing these standards within an outpatient clinical setting. Therefore, <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this work was}} to design and evaluate a patient-information leaflet for new patients referred to the department, advising them about the physiotherapy process and addressing some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core standards. RELEVANCE: This work reflects the Government’s agenda for clinical governance, ‘creating {{an environment in which}} excellence in clinical care will flourish’ (Secretary of State for Health 1998). It also addresses local needs, informing patients about their physiotherapy service and <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> delivery <b>of</b> care. DECSRIPTION: <b>The</b> leaflet development was completed in 3 stages: 1) 50 patients were asked to identify what information they would like to know about physiotherapy, the department, their first visit, and their rights, for <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> developing a leaflet; 2) 100 consecutive patients discharged from the outpatient physiotherapy service were asked to participate in an anonymized postal audit evaluating their experience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> department, using the CSP’s standardized ‘Patient Feedback’ questionnaire; 3) a patient-information leaflet was developed using the responses from stage 1, the core standards and input from clinicians. This leaflet was piloted with 100 patients. OBSERVATIONS: The response rate for stage 1 = 74 %. Patients most wanted directions to the department, information about their personal physiotherapist (such as their name and level <b>of</b> experience), <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> and likelihood <b>of</b> a successful outcome of treatment. In stage 2, the feedback from patients was generally positive, with 89 % enjoying ‘coming for physiotherapy’ and 87 % being ‘very satisfied’ with their care. However, 43 % of patients did not recover as well as they had hoped and nearly 8 % considered their physiotherapy to be ‘a waste of time’. In stage 3, the mean score for the leaflet on a scale of 0 - 10, where 0 =‘of no benefit’ and 10 =‘extremely helpful’ was 8. 4. Work is currently underway to repeat the audit from stage 2 with 100 consecutive patients discharged from the department, who had received the leaflet prior to their first appointment. These findings will be compared to the findings from stage 2. CONCLUSIONS: A simple, patient-information leaflet, sent out with <b>the</b> <b>appointment</b> card before patients first attend an outpatient physiotherapy department, is proving popular with patients and can be used as part of a range of strategies to implement the core standards into clinical practice and improve patient care...|$|R

40|$|Customer {{service is}} a measure of support and {{courtesy}} provided to individuals who patronize an organization, and is a factor vital to <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> any business.

Results suggest that most WIC participants served by the Duval County Health Department were satisfied; however, three areas exist for improvement.
