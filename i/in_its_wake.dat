5000|$|A {{simple way}} of {{considering}} wave-making resistance {{is to look}} at the hull <b>in</b> relation to <b>its</b> <b>wake.</b> At speeds lower than the wave propagation speed, the wave rapidly dissipates to the sides. As the hull approaches the wave propagation speed, however, the wake at the bow begins to build up faster than it can dissipate, and so it grows in amplitude.

This results in an exponential increase in resistance with increasing speed.|$|R
