25|$|As President Bush's AIDS Coordinator, Tobias was {{responsible}} for setting policy detailing which countries would receive monies from various US agencies, <b>how</b> <b>much,</b> <b>and</b> what the rules governing assignment of those funds would be. As AIDS Coordinator, he discussed the rules {{in an interview with}} PBS' Frontline where he detailed a legal requirement that recipients of U.S. aid denounce prostitution:The Congress I think very appropriately has put into the legislation that created this program that organizations, in order to receive money, need to have a policy opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking. I don't think it's too difficult for people to be opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking, which are in fact two contributing causes to the spread of HIV/AIDS. I think when organizations initially became aware of that requirement, some organizations were concerned about what the implications of that might be, but we implemented that in the first year with non-U.S. organizations. We're now implementing that requirement with U.S. organizations. And so far, I really know of no problems that we've had on the ground.|$|E

Charles Rosen comments that [...] "most of the written-out indications of rubato in Chopin {{are to be found}} in his mazurkas... It is probable that Chopin used the older form of rubato so important to Mozart... the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in the bass... An allied form of this rubato is the arpeggiation of the chords thereby delaying the melody note; according to Chopin's pupil Karol Mikuli, Chopin was firmly opposed to this practice." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the past}} {{electrical}} generation was all dispatchable and consumer demand led <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>and</b> when to dispatch power. The trend in adding intermittent {{sources such as}} wind, water, solar, means the grid is beginning to be led by the intermittent supply instead. Effective use of intermittent sources relies on electric power grids that are carfully managed, for instance using highly dispatchable generation that is able to shut itself down whenever an intermittent source starts to generate power, and to successfully startup without warning when the intermittents stop generating. [...] Ideally {{the capacity of the}} intermittents would grow to be larger than consumer demand for periods of time, creating excess low price electricity to displace heating fuels or be converted to mechanical or chemical storage for later use.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "correlatives" [...] are a {{paradigm}} of pro-forms, {{used to ask}} and answer the questions what, where, when, why, who, whose, how, <b>how</b> <b>much,</b> <b>and</b> what kind. They are constructed from set elements so that correlatives with similar meanings have similar forms: There are nine endings corresponding to the nine wh- questions, and five initial elements that perform the functions of asking, answering, denying, being inclusive, and being indefinite about these nine questions. For example, the words kiam (when) and kiu (who, which), with the initial ki- of questions, ask about time and individuals, whereas the words tiam (then) and tiu (this/that one), with the same endings but the initial ti- of demonstratives, answer those questions, and the words neniam (never) and neniu (no-one) deny those questions. Thus by learning these 14 elements the speaker acquires {{a paradigm}} of 45 adverbs and pronouns.|$|E

Instead, RÄƒdulescu-Motru expanded on Titu Maiorescu's criticism of [...] "forms without fundament" [...] (in reference to {{the discrepancy between the}} Westernized facade and the underdeveloped economic and social setting), viewing the class of low-ranking boyars, increasingly attracted to Liberal currents during the 19th century, as the main agents of incoherent changeâ€“ this attracted him the criticism of the Poporanist Garabet IbrÄƒileanu, who argued that Junimea was an exclusivist school of criticism that [...] "has never said [...] what, <b>how</b> <b>much,</b> <b>and</b> when should be imported". In this context, IbrÄƒileanu emphasized the gestures of boyars before and during the Organic Regulation government, as indicative of a skeptical nationalist mood (rather than of a cosmopolitan ideology).|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the seventh}} season Duchovny was in {{negotiations}} with the Fox network, saying he wanted more money (while not saying <b>how</b> <b>much)</b> <b>and</b> an improved work schedule, among other issues. After settling his contract dispute, portraying actor Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after the seventh season. This contributed to uncertainties over the likelihood of an eighth season. Carter and most fans felt the show was at its natural endpoint with Duchovny's departure, but it was decided Mulder would be abducted at {{the end of the}} seventh season, leaving things open for the actor's return in 12 episodes the following year. Duchovny's character Mulder was replaced by John Jay Doggett (portrayed by Robert Patrick). In season nine, Duchovny wasn't available for shooting, so he only appeared in three episodes with small cameos, the first being an archive footage only in [...] "Trust No 1", a brief cameo in [...] "William", which he also directed and appeared full-time in the series finale, [...] "The Truth".|$|E
2500|$|The {{size of a}} {{population}} depends on <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>and</b> how many resources are able to support it. For the population to remain the same size year after year, {{there must be an}} equilibrium, or balance between the population size and available resources. Since organisms produce more offspring than their environment can support, not all individuals can survive out of each generation. There must be a competitive struggle for resources that aid in survival. As a result, Darwin realised that it was not chance alone that determined survival. Instead, survival of an organism depends on the differences of each individual organism, or [...] "traits," [...] that aid or hinder survival and reproduction. Well-adapted individuals are likely to leave more offspring than their less well-adapted competitors. Traits that hinder survival and reproduction would disappear over generations. Traits that help an organism survive and reproduce would accumulate over generations. Darwin realised that the unequal ability of individuals to survive and reproduce could cause gradual changes in the population and used the term natural selection to describe this process.|$|E

2500|$|Internalized {{homophobia}} {{refers to}} negative stereotypes, beliefs, stigma, and prejudice about homosexuality and LGBT people {{that a person}} with same-sex attraction turns inward on themselves, {{whether or not they}} identify as LGBT. The degree to which someone is affected by these ideas depends on <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>and</b> which ideas they have consciously and subconsciously internalized. These negative beliefs can be mitigated with education, life experience and therapy, especially with gay-friendly psychotherapy/analysis. Internalized homophobia also applies to conscious or unconscious behaviors which a person feels the need to promote or conform to cultural expectations of heteronormativity or heterosexism. This can include extreme repression and denial coupled with forced outward displays of heteronormative behavior for the purpose of appearing or attempting to feel [...] "normal" [...] or [...] "accepted." [...] Other expressions of internalized homophobia can also be subtle. Some less overt behaviors may include making assumptions about the gender of a person's romantic partner, or about gender roles. Some researchers also apply this label to LGBT people who support [...] "compromise" [...] policies, such as those that find civil unions acceptable in place of same-sex marriage.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "Being-with" [...] {{refers to}} an ontological {{characteristic}} of the human being, that it is always already with others of its kind. This assertion is to be understood not as a factual statement about an individual, {{that he or she}} is at the moment in spatial proximity to one or more other individuals. [...] Rather it is a statement about the being of every human, that in the structures of its being-in-the-world one finds an implicit reference to other humans. We all live with others, and in fact we could not live without them. Humans have been called (by others, not by Heidegger) [...] "ultrasocial" [...] and [...] "obligatorily gregarious." [...] Without others of our kind we could not survive. Heidegger, from his phenomenological perspective, calls this feature of human life [...] "Being-with" [...] (Mitsein), and says it is essential to being human.
