40|$|A <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifier</b> (<b>DA)</b> {{is often}} used as a {{repeater}} in broadcast video applications to extend the reach of a link, most commonly 75 Ω coaxial cable. The data path in a DA consists of an SDI adaptive cable equalizer, SDI reclocker and SDI cable driver. In an operational system a video signal may be transmitted through multiple DAs or similar equipment, such as a video router, before reaching its final destination. The DA’s primary function is to reconstruct signal integrity of the incoming attenuated signal back to its original state by opening the waveform eye (equalizer), cleaning high-frequency jitter (reclocker) and setting appropriate slew rate and signal amplitude (cable driver). Low frequency jitter, below the loop bandwidth of the reclocker’s PLL, will be passed through. Adding several DAs in cascade will eventually result in accumulated low-frequency jitter {{commonly referred to as}} jitter peaking. Some SDI reclockers and equalizers are more susceptible to jitter peaking than others. This report focuses on an experiment {{to determine the effects of}} cascading multiple DAs using National Semiconductor’s LMH 0344 SDI adaptive cable equalizer, LMH 0356 SDI reclocker, and LMH 0303 SDI cable driver. In the experiment, eye patterns were collected, jitter tolerance graphs acquired using a PRBS 1...|$|E

Two different classes of <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are then reviewed to see how they compare to the sources presented earlier. The front-to-back isolation and phase noise of a <b>distribution</b> <b>amplifier</b> are not the only important parameters that need to be considered.
