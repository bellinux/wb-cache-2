50|$|Today, this {{particular}} municipality remains a controversial topic {{of local and}} national politics. On May 31, 2010, its city council voted a motion asking that it be reassigned from the Flemish Region to the Brussels Capital Region, {{in view of the}} majority of francophones residing there. A considerable number of Belgian French-speakers would like this to happen, thus creating a <b>geographical</b> <b>link</b> between Wallonia and Brussels. Francophone politicians propose this in exchange of the Flemish demand for the splitting of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde. The reassignment of the area is strongly opposed by most Flemish people, their politicians and their institutions, who argue that the borders of Belgium's regions should not be changed simply because many people move from one region to another. They see the incorporation of the territory into the Brussels {{as a threat to the}} language and cultural rights of Flemish residents, and that a precedent would be set that would invite further Francophone migration to other municipalities with facilities. They also view this tendency as the extension of an already prevalent Francophone influence on the capital region.|$|E

This paper {{describes}} the iterative development {{and evaluation of}} high usability mobile user interface elements for query and exploration of <b>geographical</b> <b>Linked</b> Data. It includes an analysis and synthesis of {{the current state of}} the art in geo-graphical Linked Data visualization and industry design guidelines for mobile device user interfaces. It addresses the lack of published research on mobile Linked Data application usability or user experience. The usability studies described here com-pare the usability of custom mobile Linked Data query and exploration interfaces to standard <b>geographical</b> <b>Linked</b> Data inter-faces available on fixed platforms. Evidence was collected that suggests that despite the limitations of a mobile interface for complex tasks, such as Linked Data query and exploration, it is possible to attain equivalent usability on mobile devices to fixed platforms. The importance of visual feedback for users was demonstrated when designing for the limited screen area of mobile devices. The user study provides evidence that task-oriented HCI elements or controls are more important for usability than dataset explanation or visualization. The limited screen area of mobile devices often necessitates multi-screen task dia-logs. This study provides evidence that minimizing the memory requirements for the user for multi-screen tasks, in terms of visual clues of state in subsequent screens or even animated transitions between screens, produces a better user experience. The prototype mobile application developed as part of this user study delivers highly usable <b>Linked</b> Data <b>geographical</b> data-set exploration and query that compares favourably to state of the art fixed platform geographical tools.

Abstract The world city theory focuses on concentration of the most progressive activities of the social-economic system in a few key cities that together have a major share of command and control power within the global economy. Location advantages of such cities attract TNC headquarters, financial services and R&D facilities. Interactions between them lead to further strengthening {{of the position of}} the global city and it brings a cumulative effect on the location advantages. This paper examines the global city hierarchy based on the data on 1 500 world's biggest companies headquarters location, as well as location of 1 500 most important R&D institutions and 200 biggest banks.

40|$|The current paper {{proposes a}} novel {{end-to-end}} congestion control suitable for multimedia flows, {{with the primary}} aim of guaranteeing a good level of smoothness to the connections that employ it. The suggested strategy, termed Adaptive GAIMD, has as its starting point a blind, window-based scheme named General Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease (GAIMD); it however enhances it through a measurement-based prediction of network conditions, based on the observation of the interarrival times of the most recently received triple duplicate acknowledgments. Such forecast allows the control to selectively switch to the AIMD policy, i. e., to a TCP-like behavior, when the network drifts towards overload conditions. On the other hand, if the network is sensed lightly loaded, the control behaves as GAIMD. In all cases, Adaptive GAIMD guarantees a smoother packet delivery than native GAIMD and TCP would. The validity of the proposed approach is experimentally proved, performing numerous tests and comparisons between Adaptive GAIMD, GAIMD and TCP-Sack, that took place on a <b>geographical</b> <b>link</b> spanning from Modena, Italy, to Los Angeles, United States...|$|E

Out of the examined samples, 130 of which (about 64 %) of suspected farms were positive for IBV with real time RT-PCR. 13 IBV-positive samples were selected for further isolation and characterization. Isolation in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryos was carried out after studies three blind successive passages and the hypervariable region of spike protein 1 (SP 1) was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced to study the genetic diversity between the isolated viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the obtained sequences of 13 isolates compared with other IBV strains from the Middle East and worldwide reveled that 11 out of the 13 isolates had close relationship the Israeli variants (IS/ 885 and IS/ 1494 / 06) with nucleotide homology reached up to 89. 9 % and 82. 3 %, respectively.

40|$|State sector {{education}} policy in England aims to deliver raised standards of attainment and equality of educational opportunity through offering fair access to schools for all pupils from any background. Two initiatives of 'school choice' and `school improvement' have been specifically introduced for this purpose. Choice policies came {{about in the}} late 1980 s. They propose to provide equal access through breaking the historical <b>geographical</b> <b>link</b> between {{the home and the}} school attended. Pupils can apply for admission to any preferred school from their current home location. An equal distribution of better standards in education is thought to be achieved through the scheme's creation of school competition for pupils. Improvement strategies took off in the early 2000 s under the Academies Programme. The initiative targets the re-emergence of low-performing schools as viable competitors for pupils through a process of institutional reform. It aspires to raise standards and equality by providing more opportunities for all pupils to have access to better-quality schools. The National Pupil Database is an administrative annual census of state school pupils that allows enrolment-related activity in schools to be tracked. It is used here to address whether fairness is an outcome of the two education policies. Evaluation considers (i) if pupils of differing backgrounds gain access to popular primary schools without moving home under the choice system and; (ii) if failing secondary schools that convert into Academies remain accessible to all pupils. Evidence indicates that the connection between the school attended and home location persists partly because entry rules by popular schools reinstate school-home proximity as an admissions criteria. Meanwhile, there is exclusivity in entry to Academies, with proportionally fewer underprivileged, low-ability pupils featuring in the renewed schools. These outcomes suggest that {{education policy}} {{has a long way to}} go if fair access to schools is to be achieved. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} strategy. Making as practised by small professional football clubs. The study was undertaken because football clubs were perceived to have problems with strategy-making {{and because it was}} believed that the specific circumstances of football clubs could be outside the range of views covered by conventional views of strategy-making. The characteristics of the club environment are its uncertainty and unpredictability, simultaneous competition and co [...] operation, strong regulations, and a not-for-profit orientation. Small clubs in particular face a constant struggle for financial viability and survival, due in part to split business and playing objectives. The study was designed to establish the extent and nature of the difficulties clubs experience with a view to preparing the way for creating practical guidance on ways to overcome them. Clearly, in order to survive in the long term, small professional football clubs require very effective strategic decisions. This study has addressed this issue by inquiring into the nature of strategy making for these organisations with the objective to establish the general direction in which the football clubs in question should be moving. As a result, the main research question to guide this investigation was determined as: Why do small professional football clubs have difficulties making strategies. The investigation was based on an analysis the concept of strategy and its elements, the strategic vision and objectives, the process by which strategic action comes about, the strategic action itself, and the context within which this action occurs. Data has been collected, analysed and interpreted in relation to each of these elements. Together {{with a wide variety of}} published material, 20 small football clubs have been sampled and personal interviews were conducted with board members of those clubs. The findings indicate that small football clubs do indeed experience considerable difficulties in making strategies, the reasons for which lie both in the characteristics of their competitive environment and their approaches to strategy-making. The competitive environment is characterised by a cartel-like structure with a high degree of regulation, high levels of uncertainty, little control over the core product or the production process, short-term business cycles and a close <b>geographical</b> <b>link</b> between a club with its local market. The management of clubs is characterised by the need to balance conflicting sporting and business objectives. Formal planning techniques are of little use in the small football club context as decision-making processes have a strong political character and the development of novel strategies is hindered by a strong conservative, industry paradigm and a lack of financial and managerial resources. It is concluded that there is no simple advice to be given to clubs, as they must re-examine the relationship between their playing and business objectives to create a unified and workable approach...|$|E

The aim of the research was to establish if there were common links and themes between these saints, given that so many of them are found and remembered solely in Cornwall and, in the majority of cases, have only one church dedicated to them. Given the lack of contemporaneous written material relating to these saints, much focus was placed on material evidence relating to them in terms of churches and holy wells, many of which I visited. Secondary evidence relating to these saints has also been considered, including the work of both modern scholars and earlier sources. Although much work has been carried out on the saints of Cornwall, little has been done to establish any parallels between the female saints. In many cases, the lack of knowledge about them means that they are all but forgotten outside of their parish boundary. It became clear as I researched more that there were links between them in terms of common themes (in particular, the themes of water and holy wells, and of the virgin martyr).
