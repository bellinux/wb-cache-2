500|$|The song {{begins with}} a rap verse {{performed}} by Jay Z, whose lines include: [...] "I talk big money, I talk big homes / <b>I</b> <b>sell</b> out arenas, I call that getting dome / Million dollar voice, came through phone / We heading to the top, if you coming, come on". He raps at a slow pace and incorporates both double entendres and humorous remarks, including a sexual reference that Claire Suddath viewed was an indication of Jay Z's enjoyment on the song: [...] " [...] had it by her bladder, she's like 'Oh I gotta pee!'." [...] Melissa Maerz from Entertainment Weekly remarked that he [...] "even touts their jet-set lifestyle on the title track, bragging that he can fly out to Pisa / Just to get some pizza." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's release {{generated}} much publicity over a sales {{competition with}} 50 Cent's Curtis. Three months that were {{prior to the}} September 11 release date, West extended his gratitude towards 50 Cent for the enthusiasm and excitement the friendly competition had produced. Though confident that he would emerge victorious, West {{said that he would}} be perfectly fine with losing to 50 Cent, saying that he'd rather, [...] "be #2 on that day rather than come out and be #1 on a day nobody cares about." [...] In an interview for USA Today, 50 Cent expressed his view on the idea of a sales competition, stating [...] "It's great marketing — for Kanye West. But <b>I</b> <b>sell</b> way more records than Kanye West, and I generate way more interest than Kanye West. They think they can match us up, but they'll find out when that week goes by and the sales come back. This is no rivalry." [...] "Mine will sell and his will still be on the shelf," [...] 50 Cent tells ROLLING STONE". On August 10, 50 Cent confirmed during an interview with SOHH that he would end his career as a solo recording artist if Graduation were to sell more copies than Curtis in the United States. However, 50 Cent later retracted his statement within an MTV interview due to his contract agreements with Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. [...] But most retailers and radio programmers interviewed pick Kanye, whose current single, [...] "Stronger," [...] is Number Six on BiIIboard's Hot 100 -while none of 50's four singles have climbed higher than thirty-two. [...] "In hip-hop you're only as good as your last hit, and Kanye's got the bigger hit right now," [...] says Bruce St. James, program director for Phoenix hip-hop station Power 98.3.|$|E

Allegiant CEO Maurice Gallagher said in 2009, [...] "We collect $110 from you {{at the end of}} your trip. If I tried to charge you $110 up front, you wouldn't pay it.

2500|$|The {{government}} hasn't {{still been}} able to formulate a correct approach to the “Armenian question.” Its real aim is not to solve the problem, but to gain points like a wrestler in a contest. How and when it will make the right move and defeat its opponent. That's the only concern. This is not earnestness. The state calls on Armenian historians to discuss history, but does not shy from trying its own intellectuals who have an unorthodox rhetoric on the Armenian genocide. It restores an Armenian church in the Southeast, but only thinks, “How can I use this for political gains in the world, how can <b>I</b> <b>sell</b> it?” ...|$|E
2500|$|More particularly, two {{incidents}} involving Trudeau are {{remembered as}} having fostered Western alienation, and as emblematic of it. During {{a visit to}} Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on July 17, 1969, Trudeau met {{with a group of}} farmers who were protesting the Canadian Wheat Board. The widely remembered perception is that Trudeau dismissed the protesters' concerns with [...] "Why should <b>I</b> <b>sell</b> your wheat?"– however, he had asked the question rhetorically and then proceeded to answer it himself. Years later, on a train trip through Salmon Arm, British Columbia, he [...] "gave the finger" [...] to a group of protesters through the carriage window– less widely remembered is that the protesters were shouting anti-French slogans at the train.|$|E
