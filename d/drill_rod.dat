40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to follow up {{blasting}} at the development work of drifts by measuring the distance from a fixed point to the faces before and after scaling and then analyzes the data. LKAB Malmberget needs to follow up the blasting to improve and make the development of drifts more effective. The goals of the project have been to investigate if {{the length of the}} <b>drill</b> <b>rods,</b> <b>drilling</b> plan or the placement of faces affects the need for scaling. The work has involved a literature review of tunneling and its processes, a five-week field study at the development of drifts in LKAB Malmberget where the collection of data was done, analysis, comparing and finally documenting in report form. Development {{is the first step in}} the extraction of ore. Development involves the building of new fields and transport routes in the mine where the ore can be mined and transported. There are two types of drifts in the ore bodies, main gallery and cross cut. It is in the cross cuts the large-scale sub-level caving takes place, which LKAB is known for. At the development work, LKAB Malmberget is using the conventional cycle of blasting which includes drilling, charging, blasting, ventilation, excavation, scaling and reinforcement. At the drilling of the drifts there are three drilling rigs with two different lengths of the <b>drill</b> <b>rods,</b> 16 and 18 feet. In the western field, a rig with 18 foot rod is used and the eastern field has two rigs with both 16 and 18 foot. There are also two different types of drilling plans with different numbers of holes. The drilling plan with 76 holes is used on the western field and the drilling plan on the eastern field has fewer holes. The results of the project show that the need for scaling is greatest when using the 18 foot <b>drill</b> <b>rods,</b> which can be caused by abnormalities of the drill holes or a failed blasting where the rock was not thrown out in the drift. Since the drill holes are longer when using 18 foot <b>drill</b> <b>rods</b> there are also possible that air pockets are formed during the charging in the explosives which can result in an uneven and weak detonation. Further the results show that the need of scaling increases when the face is placed in ore which may be caused by the density. The ore has a higher density than waste rock which makes it harder to blast in ore. The difference in distance before and after scaling is more even for faces placed in ore, which may its base in the formation of a slice of ore closest to the face which is released more even then waste rock does under the scaling process. The drilling plan has no significant effect on the needed scaling because there is only a few holes difference in the drilling plans on the eastern and western field which otherwise is equal. If the dimensions of the profile may vary, there can be an effect on the need for scaling. Validerat; 20110928 (anonymous...|$|R

50|$|Where a {{reciprocating}} action is produced, such {{as for a}} rock drill, the valve may be actuated either by inertia of the frame or by {{the movement of the}} working piston. As the piston hammers back and forth, it impacts a small tappet, which in turn moves the air valve and so reverses the flow of air to the piston. One form of this, the arc tappet valve, was an important feature of the Ingersoll rock drill, the first successful compressed air rock drill for use in mining and tunneling. This used a valve that rotated in a slight arc, rather than sliding. The valve was double-acting, controlling the air supply for both the power and the return stroke. The innovation that made this valve so reliable, thus successful, was a separate tappet that was actuated by the piston in passing at the middle of the stroke, rather than being hammered by a jarring direct impact of the piston. The mid-stroke actuation also opened the valve passageways earlier, before top dead centre, allowing in air that provided a cushioning effect. This further improved the action of the drill, giving a powerful stroke on the working piston and <b>drill</b> <b>rod,</b> but with less damaging hammering to the frame of the drill.|$|E
