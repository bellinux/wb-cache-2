50|$|The {{low quality}} {{technology}} used for large-scale burning of brown coal {{led to a}} sharp increase in the content of harmful sulfur dioxide and aerosols in the atmosphere. The result was wholesale damage to the environment (such as the die-back of the forests in the Ore Mountains from acid rain) and human health. In view of the unsustainable situation, the first post-communist Czechoslovak government decided to resolve the situation by introducing <b>desulphurization</b> and aerosol removal from major state-owned power plants, and the setting of limits which specific mines should not go beyond in future. In areas that had already been mined, support was also given to the reclamation of damaged landscape. The limits hence served as a government guarantee to North Bohemian communities that their environment would no longer continue to deteriorate and that their very existence has a long-term future, i.e. that it is worth purchasing property there, building and renovating houses, reconstructing roads and utilities, establishing businesses, etc.|$|E
50|$|This section {{contains}} {{a series of}} interactive simulations of major steelmaking processes from raw materials, Basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS) and Electric arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking, secondary steelmaking, Continuous casting and Hot rolling. Different steel grades can be processed using two levels of operation which are suitable for students and graduates in the industry. The ‘student level’ provides a basic functionality enabling the user to understand and control the process principles without too many operational complications, whereas the ‘industry level’ has advanced functionality and the user needs to deal with practical disturbances that are not anticipated in advance. Real-time feedback is given on the composition {{and quality of the}} steel, on process time and temperature and incurred costs, to allow the process to be optimized. A user guide and more conventional supporting e-learning units are also available within each module to enable the learner to better understand the reactions. For example, in the secondary steelmaking module, there are sections on deoxidation, <b>desulphurization,</b> decarburization and dehydrogenation.|$|E
50|$|Doraiswamy {{was known}} to have {{introduced}} several innovations in chemical reaction engineering. Gas-solid catalytic and non-catalytic reactions, solid-solid reactions, phase-transfer catalysis mediated reactions, stochastic modelling, fluidization, adsorption and catalysis and catalytic reactor analysis {{are some of the}} areas where his researches reportedly made improvements. He launched radical changes in the processing of dimethylaniline, chloromethanes, methylchlorosilanes, ethylenediamine and vitamin B6. He introduced a complete process for methyl, ethyl, butyl and 2-ethylhexylacrylates while the process initiated by him, jointly with G. D. Rihani in 1965 for calculating enthalpy, entropy and the Cp for an ideal gas is known as Rihani-Doraiswamy method. Verma-Doraiswamy method for the estimation of Standard enthalpy of formation is another process that bears his name. The invention jointly made with Thomas Wheelock of a calcium based sorbent for coal gas <b>desulphurization,</b> introduction of zeolite catalysts, the development of a xylene isomerization process and a new methodology for the alkylation of benzene with alcohols are some of his other contributions. It was at the tissue culture pilot plant established by him where a method of propagation of bamboo by tissue culture was identified for the first time.|$|E

50|$|Pigments {{and other}} {{biomarkers}} produced by organisms can evade microbial and chemical degradation and persist in sedimentary rocks. Under conditions of preservation, {{the environment is}} often anoxic and reducing, leading to chemical loss of functional groups like double bonds and hydroxyl groups. The exact reactions during diagenesis are poorly understood, although some have proposed reductive <b>desulphurization</b> as a mechanism for saturation of okenone to okenane. There is always the possibility that okenane is created by abiotic reactions, possibly from methyl shifts in β-carotene. If this reaction was occurring, okenane would have multiple precursors and the biological specificity of the biomarker would be diminished. However, {{it is unlikely that}} isomer specific rearrangements of two methyl groups are occurring without enzymatic activity. The majority of studies conclude that okenane is a true biomarker of purple sulfur bacteria. However, other biological arguments against this interpretation hold merit. Past organisms that synthesized okenone may not be modern analogues of purple sulfur bacteria. There may also be other okenone producing photosynthesizers in today's ocean that are uncharacterized. A further complication is horizontal gene transfer. If Chromatiaceae gained the ability to create okenone more recently that the Paleoproterozoic, then the okenane does not track purple sulfur bacteria, but rather the original gene donor. These ambiguities indicate that interpretation of biomarkers in billion-year-old rocks will be limited by understanding of ancient metabolisms.|$|E
50|$|Major {{equipment}} like boiler, turbine, auxiliaries like BFP, CEP, PA fans, bowl mills etc. were {{supplied by}} BHEL. In coal handling plant, major equipment like {{primary and secondary}} crusher were supplied by TRF and wagon tippler was supplied by Heavy Engineering Corporation (HEC). Since commissioning none of the unit could deliver the desired level of generation for various reasons. Some {{of the main reasons}} were problem in the boiler, turbine, mill and other unit auxiliaries and also in the coal handling plant. During July 2002, the plant was running at a very low PLF of 4.6%, very high auxiliary power consumption of 22.68% very high specific oil consumption of 59.12 ml/kwhr and height specific coal consumption of 0.85 kg/kwhr with a coal of GCV 3500 Kcal/kg. None of the units could deliver the required level of generation and the maximum PLF of the plant in the last twenty years of operation has been only 24.23%. As a result, the station had to be shut down. It had been found that although it was technically feasible to renovate the existing units of BTPS, {{it would not have been}} economically viable as the tariff works out to about Rs 3.16 per unit after carrying out R&M at an estimated cost of about Rs 7 billion. Hence, capital grant/viability gap funding of Rs 3.5 billion would have to be provided to bring down the tariff to an acceptable level of Rs 2.50 per unit. The alternative is NTPC's proposal to set up a new 750 MW (3 X 250 MW) Thermal Power Station at the same location, at a total project cost of approximately Rs Rs 44.9624 billion based on third quarter 2006 price level. The power station would be based on Fuel Gas <b>Desulphurization</b> (FGD) technology due to high sulphur content of Assam coal, involving additional cost of Rs 0.5 crores/MW approximately.|$|E
40|$|<b>Desulphurization</b> {{of liquid}} {{hydrocarbon}} fuel is necessary {{due to the}} increasingly stringent environmental regulations on the sulphur content of liquid hydrocarbon fuel. Also, oil products produced from waste tyre pyrolysis have sulphur content of about 1. 0 wt% which is far higher than the regulations. Therefore, <b>desulphurization</b> is important for commercialization of tyre pyrolysis oil. In this project, different chemical <b>desulphurization</b> methods were applied to tyre pyrolysis oil. It {{was found that the}} best <b>desulphurization</b> system consists of three processes. Oil is first extracted by acetonitrile, followed by the oxidative <b>desulphurization</b> by hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid. The last step is a further extraction by acetonitrile. This <b>desulphurization</b> gives high <b>desulphurization</b> efficiency with reasonable oil recovery. After determining the best chemical <b>desulphurization</b> system, three reaction parameters (reaction temperature, amount of acetic acid and amount of hydrogen peroxide) were investigated. For each parameter, four conditions were examined. The results showed that the best <b>desulphurization</b> conditions are 50 °C with 5 vol% of acetic acid and 10 vol% of 30 % hydrogen peroxide solution. The <b>desulphurization</b> efficiency of this system is around 30 %. Biological <b>desulphurization</b> of tyre pyrolysis oil by Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS 8 was conducted both in flask cultures and in a controlled fermenter. It was found that the optimum oil/water ratio was 1 : 1. The <b>desulphurization</b> of this system was around 28 %. Emulsification and demulsification of oil and water during biodesulphurization was also investigated. The optimum emulsification is achieved by aeration while demulsification can be achieved by either ultrasound or centrifugation depending on requirements on oil quality and reaction time requirements. A novel scheme for combining chemical, physical and biological <b>desulphurization</b> was developed based on the experimental findings. In this system, biodesulphurization is conducted before chemical <b>desulphurization.</b> The reactor used for biodesulphurization is a plug flow reactor (PFR) while that used for chemical <b>desulphurization</b> is a continuous-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{touches the}} problem of {{recycling}} battery scrap and <b>desulphurization</b> methods. The aim {{of this paper is}} to compare sodium method and new amine method for <b>desulphurization</b> of battery paste. Also the comparison of this methods refers to environmental and technological aspects of lead smelting. Design/methodology/approach: Base of the comparison of two different methods were tests of melting of desulphurized battery paste in a rotary-tilting furnace by BJ Industries Company. Findings: Both methods of <b>desulphurization</b> allow to reduce amount of sulphur to less than 1 %. The economic considerations determine the degree of <b>desulphurization</b> of battery paste. Amine method allows to reduce sulphur to a degree of about 0, 5 % maintaining favorable technical and economical parameters. Research limitations/implications: Effectiveness of amine method was confirmed in the pilot-scale tests, but it’s difficult to say what will be the results of <b>desulphurization</b> by this method in industrial scale.
