5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s she was {{attending}} art {{classes at the}} Art Students League of New York, and in 1941 she had her first solo exhibition. A student of Hans Hofmann and Chaim Gross, Nevelson experimented with early conceptual art using found objects, and dabbled in painting and printing before dedicating her lifework to sculpture. Usually created out of wood, her sculptures appear puzzle-like, with multiple intricately cut pieces placed into wall sculptures or independently standing pieces, often 3-D. A unique feature of her work is that her figures are often painted in monochromatic black or white. A figure in the international art scene, Nevelson was showcased at the 31st Venice Biennale. Her work is seen in major collections <b>in</b> <b>museums</b> and corporations. Nevelson {{remains one of the}} most important figures in 20th-century American sculpture.|$|E

Lambert's position as the heaviest person in recorded history was soon overtaken by the American Mills Darden (1799–1857), but Lambert had by now become a cult figure, and virtually every item connected with him was preserved for posterity. His clothes and possessions were sold at auction to collectors, {{and many of them}} are preserved <b>in</b> <b>museums</b> today.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th and 18th Centuries, {{equation}} clocks were made, which allowed {{the user to}} see or calculate apparent solar time, as would be shown by a sundial. Before {{the invention of the}} pendulum clock, sundials were the only accurate timepieces. When good clocks became available, they appeared inaccurate to people who were used to trusting sundials. The annual variation of the equation of time made a clock up to about 15 minutes fast or slow, relative to a sundial, depending on the time of year. Equation clocks satisfied the demand for clocks that always agreed with sundials. Several types of equation clock mechanism were devised. which can be seen in surviving examples, mostly <b>in</b> <b>museums.</b>|$|E

5|$|Many {{items from}} the battlecruiser were sent to New Zealand after she was scrapped. Equipment {{including}} several 4-inch guns, a range finder and laundry equipment, were used by military units while other artifacts were placed on display <b>in</b> <b>museums.</b> During World War II, the 4-inch guns were the main armament of the land batteries which protected the entrances to the harbours at Auckland, Wellington and Lyttelton. The captain's piupiu was returned to New Zealand in 2005, and is {{on display at the}} Torpedo Bay Navy Museum in Auckland alongside the ship's bell and other artifacts.

5|$|Matthew and Brown also {{described}} a fifth skeleton (AMNH 5664), which Charles H. Sternberg had collected in 1917 {{and sold to}} their museum. It was smaller than other Gorgosaurus specimens, with a lower, lighter skull and more elongate limb proportions. Many sutures between bones were unfused in this specimen as well. Matthew and Brown noted that these features were characteristic of juvenile tyrannosaurids, but still described it as the holotype of a new species, G. sternbergi. Today's paleontologists regard this specimen as a juvenile G. libratus. Dozens of other specimens have been excavated from the Dinosaur Park Formation and are housed <b>in</b> <b>museums</b> across the United States and Canada. G. libratus is the best-represented tyrannosaurid in the fossil record, known from a virtually complete growth series.|$|E
5|$|Research {{work on the}} Book of the Dead {{has always}} posed {{technical}} difficulties thanks {{to the need to}} copy very long hieroglyphic texts. Initially, these were copied out by hand, with the assistance either of tracing paper or a camera lucida. In the mid-19th century, hieroglyphic fonts became available and made lithographic reproduction of manuscripts more feasible. In the present day, hieroglyphics can be rendered in desktop publishing software and this, combined with digital print technology, means that the costs of publishing a Book of the Dead may be considerably reduced. However, a very large amount of the source material <b>in</b> <b>museums</b> around the world remains unpublished.|$|E
