5|$|The hairpin banksia's {{infructescence}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> Banksia cone-like structure, {{with up to}} 100 crowded embedded follicles {{which are}} 1–2.4centimetres (⅓–1in) in diameter; these generally remain closed until burnt by bushfire.

Old flower spikes fade to brown, then grey with age. Old flower parts usually persist for a long time, giving the infructescence a hairy appearance. In Central and North Queensland, old cones of both var.spinulosa and var.collina are generally bare.|$|E
