5|$|The botik (small boat) was constructed, {{either in}} England or by Danes in Russia using an English design, in the 1640s, and {{was then called}} the St. Nicholas. The boat {{originally}} belonged to Peter the Great's grandfather; an earlier theory held that the boat {{was a gift from}} Queen Elizabeth to <b>Ivan</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terrible</b> in the 1580s. It is the last remnant of the fleet of wooden boats maintained by Peter's father, Alexis; the rest rotted from neglect or were destroyed during the rebellion of Stenka Razin.|$|E
5|$|During the war years, {{restrictions}} on {{style and the}} demand that composers write in a 'socialist realist' style were slackened, and Prokofiev was generally able to compose in his own way. The Violin Sonata No. 1, Op. 80, The Year 1941, Op. 90, and the Ballade for the Boy Who Remained Unknown, Op. 93 all came from this period. In 1943 Prokofiev joined Eisenstein in Alma-Ata, the largest city in Kazakhstan, to compose more film music (<b>Ivan</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terrible),</b> and the ballet Cinderella (Op. 87), {{one of his most}} melodious and celebrated compositions. Early that year he also played excerpts from War and Peace to members of the Bolshoi Theatre collective, but the Soviet government had opinions about the opera that resulted in many revisions. In 1944, Prokofiev composed his Fifth Symphony (Op. 100) at a composer's colony outside Moscow. He conducted its first performance on 13 January 1945, just a fortnight after the triumphant premieres on 30 December 1944 of his Eighth Piano Sonata and, on the same day, the first part of Eisenstein's <b>Ivan</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terrible.</b> With the premiere of his Fifth Symphony, which was programmed alongside Peter and the Wolf and the Classical Symphony (conducted by Nikolai Anosov), Prokofiev appeared to reach the peak of his celebrity as a leading composer of the Soviet Union. Shortly afterward, he suffered a concussion after a fall due to chronic high blood pressure. He never fully recovered from the injury, and he was forced on medical advice to restrict his composing activity.|$|E
5|$|On a Good Friday evening, Ivan Velikopolsky, a 22-year-old sacristan's son and {{clerical}} student, walks {{home and}} imagines that the bitter wind, cold, and darkness he experiences were also felt throughout history: by Rurik, <b>Ivan</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terrible,</b> and Peter the Great. Along his path, he meets Vasilisa and Lukerya, {{a mother and}} her daughter who have both been widowed. As he joins them around their fire, Ivan remarks that the warmth they feel must also have been felt by Saint Peter. Suddenly, he asks if the widows have been reading the Twelve Passion Gospels to which Vasilisa replies that they have.|$|E

5|$|Before Báthory's {{election}} to the throne of the Commonwealth, <b>Ivan</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terrible</b> of Russia had begun encroaching on its sphere {{of interest in the}} northeast, eventually invading the Commonwealth borderlands in Livonia; the conflict would grow to involve a number of nearby powers (outside Russia and Poland-Lithuania, also Sweden, the Kingdom of Livonia and Denmark-Norway). Each of them was vying for control of Livonia, and the resulting conflict, lasting for several years, became known as the Livonian War. By 1577 Ivan was in control of most of the disputed territory, but his conquest was short-lived. In 1578 Commonwealth forces scored a number of victories in Liviona and begun pushing Ivan's forces back; this marked the turning point in the war. Báthory, together with his chancellor Zamoyski, led the army of the Commonwealth in a series of decisive campaigns taking Polotsk in 1579 and Velikiye Luki in 1580.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} postulate that onion domes were borrowed by Russians from Muslim countries - {{probably from}} the Khanate of Kazan, whose conquest <b>Ivan</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terrible</b> commemorated by erecting St. Basil's Cathedral. Eight {{of the nine}} domes featured on St. Basil's Cathedral represent each attack on Kazan. The ninth dome was constructed 36 years after the siege of Kazan as a tomb for Basil. The ornate finishes of these domes are bright in color and bold in shape as they are adorned with pyramids and stripes, and many other patterns seen on other cathedrals than Basil's. Some believe that onion domes first appeared in Russian wooden architecture above tent-like churches. According to this theory, onion domes were strictly utilitarian, as they prevented snow from piling on the roof.|$|E

25|$|Saint Lazar was venerated at {{the court}} of <b>Ivan</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terrible,</b> the first Russian tsar (1547–1584), whose {{maternal}} grandmother {{was born in the}} Serbian noble family of Jakšić. Lazar appears in a fresco in the Cathedral of the Archangel, the burial place of Russian rulers in the Moscow Kremlin. The walls of the cathedral were painted in 1565 with frescoes showing all Russian rulers preceding <b>Ivan</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terrible.</b> Only four non-Russians were depicted: Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos and three Serbs—Saints Simeon, Sava, and Lazar. The prince is also represented in the Illustrated Chronicle of <b>Ivan</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terrible,</b> in its nine miniatures depicting the Battle of Kosovo. It is in this Russian book that Prince Lazar was for the first time referred to as a tsar. Around 1700, Count Đorđe Branković would write his Slavo-Serbian Chronicles, in which he claimed that Lazar was crowned tsar. This would influence Serbian folk tradition, in which the prince is to this day known as Tsar Lazar. After the death of <b>Ivan</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terrible,</b> Lazar is rarely mentioned in Russian sources.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1500s, prior to Yermak’s expeditions, the Russians {{attempted}} to push eastward into Siberia {{in search of}} furs. Under <b>Ivan</b> <b>the</b> Great, the Russians entered northwest Siberia but “to approach Siberia from that direction proved too arduous and difficult, {{even in the best}} of times.” The Russians decided that taking a southern route through the Tatar khanate of Kazan would allow them to penetrate Siberia more easily, but Kazan would need to be overthrown first. <b>Ivan</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terrible’s</b> first foreign objective upon rising to power was to take Kazan. <b>Ivan</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terrible’s</b> modernized army proved successful in the beginning of October 1552 and Ivan proceeded to open up the east to enterprising Russian individuals, such as the Stroganovs. Anika Stroganov used the former khanate of Kazan as an entryway into Siberia and established a private empire on the southwest corner of Siberia.|$|R

50|$|The Oprichnik or The Guardsman (Опричник, Oprichnik) is {{an opera}} in 4 acts, 5 scenes, by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840-1893) {{to his own}} {{libretto}} after the tragedy The Oprichniks (Опричники) by <b>Ivan</b> Lazhechnikov (1792-1869). <b>The</b> subject of the opera is the oprichniks.

25|$|During {{his long}} reign, <b>Ivan</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terrible</b> nearly doubled the already large Russian {{territory}} by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of the disintegrated Golden Horde): Kazan and Astrakhan along the Volga River, and the Siberian Khanate in southwestern Siberia. Thus, {{by the end}} of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a multiethnic, multidenominational and transcontinental state.|$|E
25|$|The Gdansk merchants had {{suffered}} {{a great deal from}} the blockade, especially because of lack of trade.
