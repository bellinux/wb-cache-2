This is known as the [...] "time bomb" [...] hypothesis of autism. Each year, the Escher Fund for Autism awards scientists grants to investigate this hypothesis. Escher discovered that her mother took heavy and continuous dosses of synthetic steroid hormone drugs when pregnant with her. Escher believes these intensive exposures subtly damaged her eggs, resulting in severe <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism</b> in her son and daughter. Escher is a longtime supporter of and collaborator with Autism Speaks. Escher claims that the increase in the rate of autism in recent times is not because of shifting diagnostic characteristics, writing that it is actually harder to get diagnosed than it used to be.|$|E
40|$|To examine brain volumes in {{substructures}} {{associated with}} the behavioral features of children with FXS compared to children with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism</b> and controls. A cross-sectional study of brain substructures was conducted at the first time-point {{as part of an}} ongoing longitudinal MRI study of brain development in FXS. The study included 52 boys between 18 – 42  months of age with FXS and 118 comparison children (boys with autism-non FXS, developmental-delay, and typical development). Children with FXS and autistic disorder had substantially enlarged caudate volume and smaller amygdala volume; whereas those children with autistic disorder without FXS (i. e., <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism)</b> had only modest enlargement in their caudate nucleus volumes but more robust enlargement of their amygdala volumes. Although we observed this double dissociation among selected brain volumes, no significant differences in severity of autistic behavior between these groups were observed. This study offers a unique examination of early brain development in two disorders, FXS and <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism,</b> with overlapping behavioral features, but two distinct patterns of brain morphology. We observed that despite almost a third of our FXS sample meeting criteria for autism, the profile of brain volume differences for children with FXS and autism differed from those with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism.</b> These findings underscore the importance of addressing heterogeneity in studies of autistic behavior...|$|E

40|$|<b>Idiopathic</b> <b>autism,</b> {{caused by}} genetic {{susceptibility}} interacting with unknown environmental triggers, {{has increased dramatically}} in the past 25 years.

Here, we examined gene expression patterns of fathead minnows treated with a mixture of three psychoactive pharmaceuticals (fluoxetine, venlafaxine & carbamazepine) in dosages intended to be similar to the highest observed conservative estimates of environmental concentrations. We conducted microarray experiments examining brain tissue of fish exposed to individual pharmaceuticals and a mixture of all three. We used gene-class analysis to test for enrichment of gene sets involved with ten human neurological disorders. Only sets associated with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism</b> were unambiguously enriched.

40|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} {{for the importance of}} genetic factors in <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism.</b> The results from independent twin and family studies suggest that the disorder is caused by the action of several genes, possibly acting epistatically. We have used cDNA microarray technology for the identification of constitutional changes in the gene expression profile associated with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism.</b> Samples were obtained and analyzed from 6 affected subjects belonging to multiplex autism families and from 6 healthy controls. We assessed the expression levels for approximately 7, 700 genes by cDNA microarrays using mRNA derived from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes. The microarray data were analyzed in order to identify up- or downregulation of specific genes. A common pattern with nine downregulated genes was identified among samples derived from individuals with autism when compared to controls. Four of these nine genes encode proteins involved in biological processes associated with brain function or the immune system, and are consequently considered as candidates for genes associated with autism. Quantitative real-time PCR confirms the downregulation of the gene encoding SEMA 5 A, a protein involved in axonal guidance. Epstein-Barr virus should be considered as a possible source for altered expression, but our consistent results make us suggest SEMA 5 A as a candidate gene in the etiology of <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism...</b>|$|E

40|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social reciprocity, impaired communication and stereotypical behaviors. Despite strong {{evidence for a}} genetic basis, few susceptibility genes have been identified. Here, we describe the positional cloning of SCAMP 5, CLIC 4 and PPCDC as candidate genes for autism, starting from a person with <b>idiopathic,</b> sporadic <b>autism</b> carrying a de novo chromosomal translocation. One of these genes, SCAMP 5 is silenced on the derivative chromosome, and encodes a brain-enriched protein involved in membrane trafficking, similarly to the previously identified candidate genes NBEA and AMISYN. Gene silencing of Nbea, Amisyn and Scamp 5 in mouse beta-TC 3 cells resulted in a twofold increase in stimulated secretion of large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs), while overexpression suppressed secretion. Moreover, ultrastructural analysis of blood platelets from the patients with haploinsufficieny {{of one of the}} three candidate genes, showed morphological abnormalities of dense-core granules (DCGs), which closely resemble LDCVs. Taken together, this study shows that in three independent patients with autism three different negative regulators of LDCV secretion are affected, respectively, suggesting that in at least a subgroup of patients the regulation of neuronal vesicle trafficking may be involved in the pathogenesis of autism. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{syndrome}} {{groups at}} high risk of autism comorbidity, like Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome, have been presented as useful models for understanding risk and protective factors involved in the emergence of autistic traits. Yet despite reaching clinical thresholds, these ‘syndromic’ forms of autism appear to differ in significant ways from the <b>idiopathic</b> or ‘non-syndromic’ <b>autism</b> profile. We explore alternative mechanistic explanations for these differences and propose a developmental interpretation of syndromic autism that takes into account the character of the genetic disorder. This interpretation anticipates syndrome-specific autism phenotypes, since the neurocognitive and behavioural expression of the autism is coloured by syndromically defined atypicalities. To uncover the true nature of comorbidities and of autism per se, we argue that it is key to extend definitions of autism to include the perceptual and neurocognitive characteristics of the disorder and then apply this multilevel conceptualization to the study of syndromic autism profiles...|$|R
40|$|Agenesis of {{the corpus}} callosum (AgCC) is a {{congenital}} condition associated with wide-ranging emotional and social impairments often overlapping with the diagnostic criteria for autism. Mapping functional connectivity in the acallosal brain can help identify neural correlates of the deficits {{associated with this}} condition, and elucidate how congenital white matter alterations shape the topology of large-scale functional networks. By using resting-state BOLD {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (rsfMRI), here we show that acallosal BTBR T? tpr 3 tf/J (BTBR) mice, an <b>idiopathic</b> model of <b>autism,</b> exhibit impaired intra-hemispheric connectivity in fronto-cortical, but not in posterior sensory cortical areas. We also document profoundly altered subcortical and intra-hemispheric connectivity networks, with evidence of marked frontothalamic and striatal disconnectivity, along with aberrant spatial extension and strength of ipsilateral and local connectivity. Importantly, inter-hemispheric tracing of monosynaptic connections in the primary visual cortex using recombinant rabies virus confirmed the absence of direct homotopic pathways between posterior cortical areas of BTBR mice, suggesting a polysynaptic origin for the synchronous rsfMRI signal observed in these regions. Collectively, the observed long-range connectivity impairments recapitulate hallmark neuroimaging findings in autism, and are consistent with the behavioral phenotype of BTBR mice. In contrast to recent rsfMRI studies in high functioning AgCC individuals, the profound fronto-cortical and subcortical disconnectivity mapped suggest that compensatory mechanism may not necessarily restore the full connectional topology of the brain, resulting in residual connectivity alterations that serve as plausible substrates for the cognitive and emotional deficits often associated with AgCC...|$|R

40|$|Synapsin I (SynI) is a {{synaptic}} vesicle (SV) phosphoprotein playing multiple {{roles in}} synaptic transmission and plasticity by differentially affecting crucial steps of SV trafficking in excitatory and inhibitory synapses. SynI knockout (KO) mice are epileptic, and nonsense and missense mutations {{in the human}} SYN 1 gene have a causal role in <b>idiopathic</b> epilepsy and <b>autism.</b> To get insights into the mechanisms of epileptogenesis linked to SYN 1 mutations, we analyzed {{the effects of the}} recently identified Q 555 X mutation on neurotransmitter release dynamics and short-term plasticity (STP) in excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We used patch-clamp electrophysiology coupled to electron microscopy and multi-electrode arrays to dissect synaptic transmission of primary SynI KO hippocampal neurons in which the human wild-type and mutant SynI were expressed by lentiviral transduction. A parallel decrease in the SV readily releasable pool in inhibitory synapses and in the release probability in excitatory synapses caused a marked reduction in the evoked synchronous release. This effect was accompanied by an increase in asynchronous release that was much more intense in excitatory synapses and associated with an increased total charge transfer. Q 555 X-hSynI induced larger facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation in excitatory synapses and stronger depression after long trains in inhibitory synapses. These changes were associated with higher network excitability and firing/bursting activity.

Furthermore, recessively inherited mutations of SLC 12 A 6 cause Andermann syndrome, characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum, which is associated with peripheral neuropathy and psychoses.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that amyloid ß (Aβ), a product of {{proteolytic}} cleavage of the amyloid β precursor protein (APP), accumulates in neuronal cytoplasm in non-affected individuals in a cell type-specific amount. In the present study, we found that the percentage of amyloid-positive neurons increases in subjects diagnosed with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism</b> and subjects diagnosed with duplication 15 q 11. 2 -q 13 (dup 15) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In spite of interindividual differences within each examined group, levels of intraneuronal Aβ load were significantly greater in the dup(15) autism group than in either the control or the <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism</b> group in 11 of 12 examined regions (p< 0. 0001 for all comparisons; Kruskall-Wallis test). In eight regions, intraneuronal Aβ load differed significantly between <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism</b> and control groups (p< 0. 0001). The intraneuronal Aβ was mainly N-terminally truncated. Increased intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ(17 - 40 / 42) in children and adults suggests a life-long enhancement of APP processing with α-secretase in autistic subjects. Aβ accumulation in neuronal endosomes, autophagic vacuoles, Lamp 1 -positive lysosomes and lipofuscin, as revealed by confocal microscopy, indicates that products of enhanced α-secretase processing accumulate in organelles involved in proteolysis and storage of metabolic remnants. Diffuse plaques containing Aβ(1 - 40 / 42) detected in three subjects with ASD, 39 to 52 years of age, suggest that there is an age-associated risk of alterations of APP processing with an intraneuronal accumulation of a short form of Aβ and an extracellular deposition of full-length Aβ in nonfibrillar plaques. The higher prevalence of excessive Aβ accumulation in neurons in individuals with early onset of intractable seizures, and with a high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy in autistic subjects with dup(15) compared to subjects with idiopathic ASD, supports the concept of mechanistic and functional links between autism, epilepsy and alterations of APP processing leading to neuronal and astrocytic Aβ accumulation and diffuse plaque formation...|$|E

A cardinal biological feature of both disorders is abnormalities of cerebral cortical brain volumes. We have previously shown that the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) promoter polymorphism is associated with cerebral cortical volumes in children with autism, and we now sought to determine whether the association was also present in children with FXS. Methods Participants included 47 2 -year-old Caucasian boys with FXS, some of whom also had autism, as well as 34 2 -year-old boys with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism</b> analyzed in a previous study. The MAOA promoter polymorphism was genotyped and tested for relationships with gray and white matter volumes of the cerebral cortical lobes and cerebro-spinal fluid volume of the lateral ventricles. Results MAOA genotype effects in FXS children were the same as those previously observed in idiopathic autism: the low activity MAOA promoter polymorphism allele was associated with increased gray and white matter volumes in all cerebral lobes.

40|$|Objective—Many {{investigators}} now routinely classify {{children with}} fragile X syndrome (FXS) {{according to whether}} or not they also meet diagnostic criteria for autism. To determine whether this classification is appropriate, we examined the profiles of autistic behaviors shown by boys and girls with FXS. Method—Individuals with FXS, aged 5 to 25 years, were assessed on two established measures of autism- the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Results—We found that 35. 1 % of boys and 4. 3 % of girls with FXS scored in the “autism ” category on both instruments. Analysis of the symptom profile indicated that both boys and girls with FXS showed lower rates of impairment on communication and reciprocal social interaction items than the reference autism samples on the measures. Furthermore, a regression model showed that IQ was significantly negatively associated with the SCQ total score in both boys and girls with FXS, when controlling for age, medication use, and FMRP levels. Conclusions—These data suggest that there are significant differences in the profile of social and communicative symptomatology in FXS compared to individuals diagnosed with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism.</b> Given these differences, the implementation of standard autism interventions for individuals with FXS may not be optimal. Maintaining the conceptual distinction between FXS (an established biological disease) and <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism</b> (a phenomenologically-defined behavioral disorder) may also facilitate the development of more targeted and thus, effective interventions for individuals with FXS in the future...|$|E

Evidence suggests that social cognitive ability, or theory of mind, may also be impaired in both conditions, and in autism, may importantly relate to pragmatic language ability. Given the substantial overlap observed in autism and FXS, this study aimed to better define those social-communicative phenotypes that overlap in these two conditions by comparing pragmatic language ability and theory of mind in children with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism</b> and children with FXS, with and without autism, as well as children with Down syndrome and typically developing controls. We further examined correlations between these cognitive-behavioral phenotypes and molecular genetic variation related to FMR 1 in the FXS group.

However, the molecular diversity of SHANK family gene products, {{as well as the}} heterogeneity in human and mouse phenotypes, pose challenges to modeling human SHANK mutations. Here, we review the molecular genetics of SHANK mutations in human ASD and discuss recent findings where such mutations have been modeled in mice. Conserved features of synaptic dysfunction and corresponding behaviors in Shank mouse mutants may help dissect the pathophysiology of ASD, but also highlight divergent phenotypes that arise from different mutations in the same gene...|$|E
40|$|SummaryInsular cortex (IC) {{contributes}} {{to a variety of}} complex brain functions, such as communication, social behavior, and self-awareness through the integration of sensory, emotional, and cognitive content. How the IC acquires its integrative properties remains unexplored. We compared the emergence of multisensory integration (MSI) in the IC of behaviorally distinct mouse strains. While adult C 57 BL/ 6 mice exhibited robust MSI, this capacity was impaired in the inbred BTBR T+tf/J mouse model of <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism.</b> The deficit reflected weakened γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) circuits and compromised postnatal pruning of cross-modal input. Transient pharmacological enhancement by diazepam in BTBR mice during an early sensitive period rescued inhibition and integration in the adult IC. Moreover, impaired MSI was common across three other monogenic models (GAD 65, Shank 3, and Mecp 2 knockout mice) displaying behavioral phenotypes and parvalbumin-circuit abnormalities. Our findings offer developmental insight into a key neural circuit relevant to neuropsychiatric conditions like schizophrenia and autism...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Autism {{results from}} {{developmental}} {{factors that affect}} many or all functional brain systems. Brain is one of tissues which are crucially in need of adenosine triphos-phate (ATP). Autism is noticeably affected by mitochondrial dysfunction which impairs energy metabolism. Considering mutations within ATPase 6, ATPase 8 and tRNALys genes, associated with different neural diseases, and the main role of ATPase 6 / 8 in energy gen-eration, we decided to investigate mutations on these mtDNA-encoded genes to reveal their roles in autism pathogenesis. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, mutation analysis for the mentioned genes were performed in a cohort of 24 unrelated patients with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism</b> by employ-ing amplicon sequencing of mtDNA fragments. Results: In this study, 12 patients (50 %) showed point mutations that represent a signifi-cant correlation between autism and mtDNA variations. Most of the identified substitutions (55. 55 %) were observed on MT-ATP 6, altering some conserved amino acids to other ones which could potentially affect ATPase 6 function. Mutations causing amino acid replacemen...|$|E
40|$|SummaryAutism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) {{may arise}} from increased ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. Many pharmacological treatments have been tested in ASD, but only limited success has been achieved. Here we report that BTBR T+ Itpr 3 tf/J (BTBR) mice, a model of <b>idiopathic</b> <b>autism,</b> have reduced spontaneous GABAergic neurotransmission. Treatment with low nonsedating/nonanxiolytic doses of benzodiazepines, which increase inhibitory neurotransmission through positive allosteric modulation of postsynaptic GABAA receptors, improved deficits in social interaction, repetitive behavior, and spatial learning. Moreover, negative allosteric modulation of GABAA receptors impaired social behavior in C 57 BL/ 6 J and 129 SvJ wild-type mice, suggesting that reduced inhibitory neurotransmission may contribute to social and cognitive deficits. The dramatic behavioral improvement after low-dose benzodiazepine treatment was subunit specific—the α 2, 3 -subunit-selective positive allosteric modulator L- 838, 417 was effective, but the α 1 -subunit-selective drug zolpidem exacerbated social deficits. Impaired GABAergic neurotransmission may contribute to ASD, and α 2, 3 -subunit-selective positive GABAA receptor modulation may be an effective treatment...|$|E
