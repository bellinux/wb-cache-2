5|$|Mycena adscendens {{produces}} a white spore print. The spores are broadly , amyloid, and have dimensions of 8–10 by 5–6.5µm. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are two-spored, club-shaped, and measure 14–17 by 7–9µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) {{may be present}} or absent. If present, they {{are similar to the}} cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edges). The cheilocystidia are abundant, measuring 28–44 by 8–12µm. They are variable in shape, often fusoid-ventricose (fuse-shaped with a swollen center) or with 2–3 needle-like projections arising from the apex; the projections are sometimes forked. The swollen parts of the cheilocystidia are covered with short rodlike protuberances or warts. The <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gills is vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap is made up of greatly enlarged cells, with the surface covered with club-shaped to almost globular cells measuring 25–40 by about 20µm.

5|$|The <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap {{consists}} {{of a number of}} microscopically distinct layers of tissue. The cuticle of the cap (known as the pileipellis) is between 8–10µm thick, and is made of a loose textura intricata, a type of tissue in which the hyphae are irregularly interwoven with distinct spaces between them. The cuticle hyphae are thick-walled to thin-walled, with scattered inconspicuous cystidia measuring 40–55 by 3.5–5.5µm. These cystidia located in the cap (pileocystidia) are cylindrical, thin-walled, yellow in Melzer's reagent, hyaline in KOH, sometimes with amorphous dingy brown material coating the walls. Beneath the cuticle layer is a zone 54–65µm thick, made of very loosely entwined, thin-walled hyphae, 2–3µm in thickness, with clamps at the septa. Below this is a zone 208–221µm in thickness, in which the densely compacted hyphae, 3–8µm in diameter, have swollen, gelatinized walls, and often more or less a vertical orientation. This in turn is followed by a layer 520µm in thickness, formed of loosely interwoven hyphae, 2–8µm in width, some of which have thin walls with clamps at the septa, whilst others have somewhat thickened gelatinized walls. The <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap has a layer of upright hyphae bending into a lower layer of interwoven hyphae with diameters of 2.5–8µm. The <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gills {{is similar to that of}} the lower cap.|$|E

5|$|Cucurbitacin is a plant steroid {{present in}} wild Cucurbita {{and in each}} member of the family Cucurbitaceae. Poisonous to mammals, it is found in {{quantities}} sufficient to discourage herbivores. It makes wild Cucurbita and most ornamental gourds, with the exception of an occasional C.fraterna and C.sororia, bitter to taste. Ingesting too much cucurbitacin can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea and even collapse. This bitterness is especially prevalent in wild Cucurbita; in parts of Mexico the <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fruits is rubbed on a woman's breast to wean children. While the process of domestication has largely removed the bitterness from cultivated varieties, there are occasional reports of cucurbitacin causing illness in humans. Cucurbitacin is also used as a lure in insect traps.|$|E

5|$|The {{barndoor}} skate {{is one of}} five skates in the Gulf of Maine that has commercial value, but of those, the species that are most frequently targeted are the winter skate (Leucoraja ocellata) and the thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata). The {{barndoor skate}} is most commonly considered by-catch by commercial trawlers operating in the northwestern Atlantic that target other commercially valuable species of fish using bottom trawling. When harvested, the <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barndoor skate is used as bait, fish meal, pet food, and the meat from its wings is sold for human consumption. Since 1981, landings of skates have increased substantially, partly in response to increased demand for lobster bait, and more significantly, to the increased export market for skate wings. Currently, commercial retention and sale of barndoor skate is prohibited in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The fruitbodies (ascocarps) of Geopyxis carbonaris are cup shaped, 1–2cm wide, {{and have}} fringed whitish margins.

5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees {{to get at the}} coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of the}} coconut. Once the pores are visible, the coconut crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|E
5|$|Two eastern North American species, C.inedulis and C.roseipes, {{also have}} an {{appearance}} similar to C.calopus. C.inedulis produces smaller fruit bodies with a white to greyish-white cap, while C.roseipes associates solely with hemlock. C.firmus, found in the eastern United States, eastern Canada, and Costa Rica, has a pallid cap colour, reddish stipe, and bitter taste, but unlike C.calopus, has red pores and lacks stipe reticulation. C.panniformis, a Japanese species described as new to science in 2013, bears a resemblance to C.calopus, but can be distinguished by its rough cap surface, or microscopically by the amyloid-staining cells in the <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap, and morphologically distinct cystidia on the stipe.|$|E
5|$|Boletellus ananas, {{commonly}} known as the pineapple bolete, is a mushroom in the family Boletaceae, and the type species of the genus Boletellus. It is distributed in southeastern North America, northeastern South America, Asia, and New Zealand, where it grows scattered or in groups on the ground, often at the base of oak and pine trees. The fruit body is characterized by the reddish-pink (or pinkish-tan to yellowish if an older specimen) scales on the cap that are often found hanging from the edge. The pore surface {{on the underside of the}} cap is made of irregular or angular pores up to 2mm wide that bruise a blue color. It is yellow when young but ages to a deep olive-brown color. Microscopically, B.ananas is distinguished by large spores with cross striae on the ridges and spirally encrusted hyphae in the marginal appendiculae and <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stem. Previously known as Boletus ananas and Boletus coccinea (among other synonyms), the species was given its current name by William Alphonso Murrill in 1909. Two varieties of Boletellus ananas have been described. Although the mushroom may be considered edible, it is not recommended for consumption.|$|E

5|$|Mycologists Tsuguo Hongo and Rokuya Imazeki {{suggested}} in the 1980s that the Japanese mushroom A.sphaerobulbosa was synonymous with the North American A.abrupta. However, a 1999 study of Amanita specimens in Japanese herbaria concluded that they were closely related but distinct species, {{due to differences in}} spore shape and in the microstructure of the volval remnants. Another similar species, A.magniverrucata, is differentiated from A.abrupta by a number of characteristics: the universal veil is clearly separated from the <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap; the volval warts disappear more quickly because the surface of the cap cuticle gelatinizes; the partial veil is more persistent; the spores are smaller and roughly spherical; {{on the underside of the}} partial veil, the stem has surface fibrils that are drawn upward so as to somewhat resemble a cortina (a cobweb-like protective covering over the immature spore bearing surfaces); A.magniverrucata has a known distribution limited to the south western coast of North America.|$|E
5|$|The pileipellis, the {{top layer}} of hyphae in the cap, is a cutis. The cutis is made up of {{cylindrical}} hyphae between 2 and 5µm thick. The inamyloid and thin-walled hyphae are covered in brown granules. The flesh in the cap is made up of cylindrical hyphae from 4 to 7µm wide with thin cell walls. They are all generative hyphae, and run parallel to one another. They can be either inamyloid or only weakly dextrinoid. The flesh in the gills is basically the same as the flesh in the cap, but for {{the fact that it is}} completely inamyloid. The hyphae of the stipitipellis, the uppermost layer in the stem, also form a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae making up the cutis run parallel to one another, and measure from 2.5 to 4.5µm in width, with walls up to 1µm thick. They are encrusted with a brown pigment, and are dextrinoid. The <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stem is made up of generative hyphae running lengthways (that is, up and down the stem).

The hymenophoral tissue (tissue of the hymenium-bearing structure) is made of thin-walled hyphae that are 7–15µm wide, cylindrical, smooth, colorless, and dextrinoid (staining reddish to reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent). The cap cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2–5µm wide, cylindrical, and densely covered with warty or finger-like thin-walled diverticulae that are colorless or contain cytoplasmic brownish pigment. The layer of hyphae underlying the cap cuticle are parallel, colorless or with cytoplasmic brownish pigment, dextrinoid, and have short and inflated cells measuring up to 30µm wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 3–5µm wide, and cylindrical. These hyphae are covered with scattered, thin-walled warty or finger-like diverticulae that can be either colorless, or contain brownish pigment in the cytoplasm.
