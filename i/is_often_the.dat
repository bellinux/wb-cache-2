5|$|For {{many years}} Averno's {{real name was}} {{not a matter of}} public record, as <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. However, in May 2011, Averno was booked in a Lucha de Apuesta, where he lost his mask and was forced to reveal his true identity. Ruíz left CMLL in April 2014 and joined rival {{promotion}} Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) the following month.|$|E
5|$|In captivity, sarus cranes {{have been}} known to live for as long as 42 years. Premature adult {{mortality}} <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> result of human actions.

5|$|Some viruses cause no {{apparent}} {{changes to the}} infected cell. Cells in which the virus is latent and inactive show few signs of infection and often function normally.

5|$|There were unfounded rumours of its {{continued}} existence until {{the beginning of}} the 20th century. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway stated that an extremely small population might still survive on small offshore islets, since this <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> last refuge of endangered birds.

5|$|Congestion pricing remains highly {{controversial}} {{with the public}} {{both before and after}} implementation. This has in part been resolved through referendums, such as after the seven-month trial period in Stockholm; however this creates a debate as to where the border line for the referendum should go, since it <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> people living outside the urban area who have to pay the tax, while the external benefit is granted those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was a majority in the referendum within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.|$|E

5|$|Female {{elephants}} {{spend their}} entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups, {{some of which are}} made up of more than ten members, including three pairs of mothers with offspring, and are led by the matriarch which <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> eldest female. She remains leader of the group until death or if she no longer has the energy for the role; a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal corticosterone ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the surviving elephants. When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present. The older matriarchs tend to be more effective decision-makers.|$|E
5|$|Home Health Aide: The home health, or hospice, aide {{is not a}} {{core service}} for a hospice patient; this means it is not {{required}} that every patient on hospice receive an aide. However, most patients do receive this service, and it <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> one most depended on by the patient and family. The hospice aide typically visits anywhere from 3–7 {{days a week for}} approximately 1–2 hours at each visit. His or her functions include providing respite to the primary caregiver and physical support to the patient, including bathing, dressing, or feeding. Many times it is the hospice aide who develops the closest relationship with the patient, due to the frequency of visits. The hospice aide is not a licensed nurse and therefore can not administer medications, treat wounds, handle IV's or similar treatments.|$|E

Their shirts are often trimmed with tricolores at the margins. Since 1981, the RBFA emblem {{has been the}} national team's badge; the previous badge was a yellow lion on a black shield, similar to the escutcheon of the national coat of arms.|$|E
