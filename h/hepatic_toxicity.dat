In this retrospective study, 151 consecutive patients undergoing cTACE or DEB-TACE and MRI 3 - 6 weeks before and after therapy were included. Toxicity was assessed on imaging (global hepatic damages (GHD), overall biliary injuries, biliary cast, bile duct dilatation, intrahepatic biloma, portal thrombosis), and clinico-biological follow-ups. Tumour response, time to progression (TTP), and overall survival were assessed. Factors influencing complication rate were identified by generalized equation logistic regression model. Biliary injuries and intrahepatic biloma incidence were significantly higher following DEB-TACE (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). DEB-TACE showed a significant increased risk of GHD (OR: 3. 13 [1. 74 - 5. 63], p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and biliary injuries (OR: 4. 53 [2. 37 - 8. 67], p[*]<[*] 0. 001). A significant relationship was found between baseline prothrombin value and GHD, biliary injuries and intrahepatic biloma (all p[*]<[*] 0. 01), and between the dose of chemotherapy and intrahepatic biloma (p[*]=[*] 0. 001). Only TTP was significantly shorter following DEB-TACE compared to cTACE (p[*]=[*] 0. 025). DEB-TACE was associated with increased <b>hepatic</b> <b>toxicities</b> compared to cTACE.

Dabigatran etexilate is rapidly absorbed, it lacks interaction with cytochrome P450 enzymes and with other food and drugs, {{there is no need for}} routine monitoring and it has a broad therapeutic index and a fixed-dose administration, which is excellent safety compared with warfarin.

40|$|EGFR inhibitors, {{even with}} {{therapeutics}} superiorities in anticancer, can cause idiosyncratic pulmonary and <b>hepatic</b> <b>toxicities</b> {{that are associated}} with the reactive electrophile bioactivated by Cytochrome P 450 s (P 450 s). Until now, neither has the electrophilic intermediate been caught experimentally, nor has the subtle mechanism been declared. Herein, the underlying mechanism of bioactivation mediated by P 450 s was explored by DFT calculations for a case of EGFR inhibitor, Erlotinib. Based on the calculation and analysis, we suggest that with other metabolites, reactive electrophiles of Erlotinib: epoxide and quinine-imine, can be generated by several steps along the oxidative reaction pathway. The generation of epoxide needs two steps: (1) the addition of Erlotinib to Compound I (Cpd I) and (2) the rearrangement of protons. Whereas, quinine-imine needs a further oxidation step (3) via which quinone is generated and ultimately turns into quinine-imine. Although both reactive electrophiles can be produced for either face-on or side-on pose of Erlotinib, the analysis of energy barriers indicates that the side-on path is preferred in solvent environment. In the rate-determining step, e. g. the addition of Erlotinib to the porphyrin, the reaction barrier for side-on conformation is decreased in aqueous and protein environment compared with gas phase, whereas, the barrier for face-on pose is increased in solvent environment. The simulated mechanism is in good agreement with the speculation in previous experiment. The understanding of the subtle mechanism of bioactivation of Erlotinib will provide theoretical support for toxicological mechanism of EGFR inhibitors...|$|R
