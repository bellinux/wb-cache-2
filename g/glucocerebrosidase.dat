50|$|The most {{detailed}} genetic analysis study of Ashkenazi {{was published in}} September 2014 by Shai Carmi and his team at Columbia University. The results of the detailed study show that today's 10 million Ashkenazi Jews descend from a population of only 350 individuals who lived about 600-800 years ago. That population derived from both Europe and the Middle East. There {{is evidence that the}} population bottleneck may have allowed deleterious alleles to become more prevalent in the population due to genetic drift. As a result, this group has been particularly intensively studied, so many mutations have been identified as common in Ashkenazis. Of these diseases, many also occur in other Jewish groups and in non-Jewish populations, although the specific mutation which causes the disease may vary between populations. For example, two different mutations in the <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> gene causes Gaucher's disease in Ashkenazis, which is their most common genetic disease, but only one of these mutations is found in non-Jewish groups. A few diseases are unique to this group; for example, familial dysautonomia is almost unknown in other populations.|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to the lysosomal <b>glucocerebrosidase,</b> a distinct beta-glucosidase that is also active towards glucosylceramide could be demonstrated in various human tissues and cell types. Subcellular fractionation analysis revealed that the hitherto undescribed <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> is not located in lysosomes but in compartments with a considerably lower density. The non-lysosomal <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> differed in several respects from lysosomal <b>glucocerebrosidase.</b> The non-lysosomal isoenzyme proved to be tightly membrane-bound, whereas lysosomal <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> is weakly membrane-associated. The pH optimum of the non-lysosomal isoenzyme is less acidic than that of lysosomal <b>glucocerebrosidase.</b> Non-lysosomal <b>glucocerebrosidase,</b> {{in contrast to the}} lysosomal isoenzyme, was not inhibited by low concentrations of conduritol B-epoxide, was markedly inhibited by taurocholate, was not stimulated in activity by the lysosomal activator protein saposin C, and was not deficient in patients with Gaucher disease.

The proportion of form II <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> was high in extracts of spleen, {{liver and kidney}} and low in extracts of brain, placenta and fibroblasts. Furthermore, the proportion of form II enzyme was higher in a detergent-free aqueous extract of spleen than in a Triton X- 100 extract of total spleen or splenic membranes. When form II <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> in a splenic extract was separated from form I enzyme by immunoaffinity chromatography and stored at 4 degrees C, a gradual conversion to form I enzyme occurred. The conversion was almost immediate if 30 % (v/v) ethylene glycol was present. In the denatured state both forms of <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> reacted with anti-(placental <b>glucocerebrosidase)</b> antibodies. Form I <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> was stimulated by sodium taurocholate or sphingolipid-activator protein 2 (SAP- 2), whereas form II enzyme exhibited maximal activity {{in the absence of}} the effectors. The pH activity profile of form II <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> was almost identical to that of form I enzyme in the presence of SAP- 2. In the native state, form I <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> had a molecular mass of 60 kDa whereas that of form II <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> was about 200 kDa. After gel-permeation high-performance liquid chromatography of splenic extracts, the fractions with form II <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> contained material cross-reacting with both anti-(placental <b>glucocerebrosidase)</b> and anti-(SAP- 2) antibodies. Preincubation of form I <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> with SAP- 2 at pH 4. 5 led to masking of the epitope on <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> reacting with monoclonal anti-(placental <b>glucocerebrosidase)</b> antibody 2 C 7. Furthermore, preincubation of form I <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> with monoclonal antibody 2 C 7 prevented activation of the enzyme by SAP- 2.

Screening of a variety of natural and synthetic alkaloid compounds showed isofagomine, N-dodecyl deoxynojirimycin, calystegines A(3), B- 1, B- 2 and C- 1, and 1, 5 -dideoxy- 1, 5 -iminoxylitol to be potent inhibitors of <b>glucocerebrosidase.</b> Among them, isofagomine was the most potent inhibitor of <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> in vitro, and the most effective active-site-specific chaperone capable of increasing residual <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> activity in fibroblasts established from Gaucher patients with the most prevalent Gaucher disease-causing mutation (N 370 S). Intracellular enzyme activity increased approximately two-fold after cells had been incubated with isofagomine, and the increase in <b>glucocerebrosidase</b> activity was both dose-dependent and time-dependent.
