The different types of risks (market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity risk) are independant variables {{and the return of}} sukuk is dependant variable. Data were collected from Nasdaq Dubai HSBC sukuk index of sukuk market period from 2005 to 2015 on a monthly basis and analyzed using descriptive, correlation analysis and multi-regressions analysis. The four regression models explain 70 % to 89 % of the variation. While risk exposure on global sukuk return is 88 %, risk exposure on sovereign sukuk return is 70 %. While risk <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>corporate</b> sukuk return is 89 % risk <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> financial sukuk return is 73 %. The results indicate that a sovereign sukuk return is very less exposed to risk compared with other sectors corporate sukuk and financial sukuk.

A primary purpose {{of this research was}} {{to determine whether or not}} perceptions of organizational image vary across different web-based recruitment methods, specifically examining corporate websites and social networking (SNW) sites, such as company Facebook profiles. A secondary goal was to determine how these perceptions of image are shaped by the objective components of websites and Facebook profiles. Finally, this study sought to determine the most influential components of websites and Facebook profiles, in terms of impacting image, to better understand how organizations can maximize their web-based recruitment efforts. ^ A total of 102 companies selected from Fortune Magazine’s 2011 top 500 were chosen for the study. Perceptions of organizational personality as well as objective assessments of personality were gathered for each organization in a two phase approach. Results indicate that <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>corporate</b> websites and company Facebook profiles do influence perceptions of image in different ways. Furthermore, individual components of the websites were identified as key drivers for influencing specific image dimensions, particularly for company Facebook pages. Findings are beneficial for advising practitioners on how to best manage their web-based recruitment sources in order to maximize efficiency. The present study serves to further our understanding of the process through which perceptions of organizational image are influenced by new recruitment sources. ...|$|R
40|$|Banks incur {{a variety}} of risks and utilise {{different}} techniques <b>to</b> manage the <b>exposures</b> so created. Some of those techniques are internal to the bank. For example, the law of large numbers enables banks to diversify away liquidity risk or default risk from a portfolio of retail loans. Alternatively, matching of asset and liability characteristics such as interest rate reset dates removes interest rate risk. Other techniques involve use of markets. For example, banks can take positions in markets in interest rate options and futures to manage interest rate risk. Unfortunately, one type of exposure does not appear amenable to either of these risk management techniques. This is the credit risk arising from loans extended <b>to</b> large <b>corporate</b> customers.

40|$|Unemployment {{scenario}} {{of the graduate}} level in Bangladesh has been a serious problem. Lately, graduates {{are more prone to}} acquire business education, which is more transferable to the job. Despite that, the business graduates are frustrated with the burden of education, as there are concurrent occurrences of joblessness. However, the prevalent dilemma of employability appears, as there are imbalances due to expected skills/qualifications by the ultimate employers. Analysis of this study tries to indicate this phenomenon by focusing of the skills/qualification (apart from degree, certificate, and diploma) that are considered as important for graduates' employability by the corporate bodies of Bangladesh. Continuous persuasion of immaculate academic results by the business graduates have been identified as less important, whereas more emphasis have been imparted on <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> the <b>corporate</b> culture and analytical competence.

Academically the relevant question is whether companies themselves feel that they are exposed to short-term pressure to perform even if it means that they have to compromise company’s long-term future. This paper studies this issue using results from a survey conducted among the 500 largest companies in Finland. The results show that companies in general feel moderate short-term pressure, with reasonable dispersion across firms. There seems to be a link between the degree of pressure felt, and the firm’s ownership structure, i. e. we find support for the existence of short-term versus long-term owners. We also find significant ownership related differences, in line with expectations, in how such short-term pressure is reflected in actual decision variables such as the investment criteria used...|$|R

Secondly, both disciplines share the goal of enhancing, or preserving, firm value. [...] There is a fundamental debate [...] relating to [...] "Risk Management" [...] and shareholder value. Per the Modigliani and Miller framework, hedging is irrelevant since diversified shareholders are assumed to not care about firm-specific risks, whereas, on the other hand hedging is seen to create value in that it reduces the probability of financial distress. A further question, is the shareholder's desire to optimize risk versus taking <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> pure risk (a risk event that only has a negative side, such as loss of life or limb).

40|$|Much public {{commentary}} has asserted or {{implied that}} the American criminal-justice system unjustly privileges individuals who commit crimes in corporations and financial markets. This Article demonstrates that this claim is not accurate—at {{least not in the}} ways commonly believed. Law and practice of sentencing, evidence, and criminal procedure cannot persuasively be described as privileging the white collar offender. Substantive criminal law makes charges in white collar cases easier to bring and harder to defend against than in other cases. Enforcement institutions, and the political economy in which they exist, include features that both shelter corporate offenders and heighten their <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> criminal liability. <b>Corporate</b> actors enjoy a large advantage in legal defense resources relative to others. That advantage, however, does not pay off quite as one might expect. A fully developed claim of privilege can be sustained only by showing that basic American arrangements of criminal law and policing have been misguided. This argument would fault the justice system for failing to treat illegal behavior within firms as requiring omnipresent policing, looser definitions of criminality, the harshest of punishments, and rethinking of the right to counsel. Those who believe corporate offenders are privileged should confront the difficulties that argument entails. And they {{should be aware of the}} complications that follow from overreliance on punishment to deal with intractable problems of ex ante regulatory control...|$|R

We posit that, ceteris paribus, corporate bonds held by investors with high <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> securitized bonds and liquidity needs experience greater selling pressure and price declines (yield increases) {{at the onset of}} the crisis. We further test predictions of a model of dynamic asset liquidation: Investors with large enough future liquidity shocks retain liquid assets, and instead sell assets that have relatively high temporary price impacts of trading. Mutual funds with higher sensitivity of pay to performance held higher portions of their portfolios in securitized bonds prior to the crisis. After the onset of the crisis, these funds did not sell securitized bonds on average and instead sold <b>corporate</b> bonds <b>to</b> meet their liquidity needs. Sales rose and yield spreads widened more for those corporate bonds whose mutual fund holders’ portfolios were more heavily exposed to securitized bonds, compared to same-issuer bonds held by unexposed funds. Shorter-horizon mutual funds liquidated greater portions of their corporate bond holdings and in particular lower-rated bonds. In contrast, insurance companies sold little regardless of their exposure as long as they were above the minimum capital ratio threshold.
