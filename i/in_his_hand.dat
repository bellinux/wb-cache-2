5|$|In the lower-left {{corner of}} the {{painting}} holding a document bearing the royal seal, stands Bartolommeo Berrecci, architect who rebuilt Royal Wawel Castle. Next to him is Seweryn Boner, an important burgher and banker. His face {{is one of the}} two self-portraits of Jan Matejko. The second is the face of the royal jester Stańczyk. As Berrecci, Matejko portrayed himself as a gray eminence, dominating the scene, with a royal scepter <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E

50|$|Generally, the {{contributing}} partner's {{basis in}} the partnership interest corresponds to the adjusted basis of the property <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> {{at the time of}} contribution plus the amount of money contributed (Sec. 722). The holding period of the partnership interest includes the contributing partner's holding period of the transferred asset if it was a capital asset <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> (Sec. 1223(1)). If it was an ordinary asset <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> the holding period of the partnership interest begins the day after the contribution.|$|R

5|$|Other portraits {{include one}} by William Nicholson dating from 1814 in which Bewick sits {{with a pencil}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and a dog beside his chair; the one at his birthplace; and the {{full-length}} seated portrait of 1827 by Thomas Sword Good (see above). Another painting by Sword in the National Portrait Gallery is now no longer thought to be of Bewick. An unsigned painting supposedly {{of him in the}} Yale Center for British Art is equally dubious.|$|E

5|$|The {{institution}} of marriage is stated to have come into existence after he married {{to set an example}} for other humans to follow.

This is accepted in the Jain tradition as what started the tradition of alms giving in its various forms, and one that has continued since ancient times in India.|$|E

5|$|Wyatt and Virgil Earp and Doc Holliday {{believed}} that Tom had a revolver {{at the time}} of the gunfight. Wyatt thought Tom fired a revolver under the horse's neck and believed until he died that Tom's revolver had been removed from the scene by Wesley Fuller. Witness Fallehy wrote that he saw Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday shooting at a man who was using a horse to barricade himself, and once shot the man fell. In his statement, Fallehy wrote that the man still held his pistol <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> Although he did not see him shoot, he thought Tom McLaury was armed.|$|E
5|$|Years later, after Ferreira has died, Kichijiro asks Rodrigues to absolve him again, but Rodrigues refuses, {{saying he}} is no longer a priest. Kichijiro later is caught with a pouch he claims to have won while {{gambling}} containing a religious amulet which he disclaims as being his own. He is taken away and never heard from again. Many years later, Rodrigues dies. He is placed in a large round wooden casket, and his body is cremated. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> is the tiny crudely-made crucifix that was given to him when he first came to Japan.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Varanasi {{was founded}} by the god Shiva. There {{happened}} a fight between the two supreme gods, Brahma and Shiva, and the succeeding combat resulted {{in one of the}} five heads of Brahma being torn off by Shiva. It was a custom of the time that the victor carried the slain adversary’s head <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. The land of Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy religious site.|$|E

5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as to let their father grieve in private. Jim {{depended}} heavily on his sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house. Jim later {{took part in the}} running of the household, as Cynthia Lennon remembered that when she and John Lennon used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often answer the door with his sleeves rolled up, a tea towel <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and an apron tied around his waist. When Paul later played at The Cavern during lunchtimes, Jim would drop off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road. Ruth remembered that Jim was funny and musical with her, but also strict when she was young, and was insistent that she learned good table manners and etiquette when speaking to people.|$|E
5|$|Beckett {{struggled}} {{in the early}} part of the 2013 season with an 0–5 record and 5.19 ERA in eight starts. He was placed on the disabled list with a groin strain on May 15. While on the disabled list he began to experience numbness and tingling <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> so he went to see a nerve specialist and expressed doubt as to whether he would be able to pitch again. The Dodgers shut him down from pitching for a month while he underwent a rigorous rehabilitation program in an effort to avoid season-ending surgery. However, the tingling sensation returned when he attempted to resume his throwing program in late June. He was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, which required him to undergo surgery on July 10, 2013 that ended his 2013 season.|$|E
5|$|Due to the NHL lockout, he {{made his}} {{professional}} debut in the AHL with the Coyotes' minor league affiliate, the Utah Grizzlies in 2004–05. He notched two goals and 20 points over 60 games in his professional rookie campaign. As NHL resumed play the following season, Ballard played his first game with the Coyotes on October 5, 2005, against the Vancouver Canucks. He scored his first NHL goal in his debut, beating goaltender Dan Cloutier. Ballard finished with 8 goals and 39 points as a rookie; both remain career highs. He led all NHL defensemen in shorthanded goals with three. Ballard was sidelined for 13 games in his second NHL season due to a bone fracture <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> suffered while blocking a shot during a game on October 9, 2006. He went on to record 27 points in 69 games. In the off-season, he was re-signed on August 29, 2007, to a two-year contract. In 2007–08, Ballard recorded a career-low 21 points.|$|E
