5|$|As Rand's story begins, he is {{restoring}} {{order in}} the nation of Arad Doman while searching for Graendal, one of the Dark One's favored servants known as the Forsaken. The Aes Sedai work with Rand to interrogate Semirhage, another Forsaken captured {{at the end of}} Knife of Dreams. After being freed by her allies, Semirhage is given a Domination Band, an item used to control male channelers, and locks it around Rand's neck. She and Black Ajah sister Elza Penfell use it to make him torture and attempt to kill his lover, Min Farshaw. Unable to channel, <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> and inexplicably accesses the True Power, a different power normally only granted by the Dark One, using it to free himself and kill Semirhage and Elza. After this, he resolves to make himself harder and emotionless. He banishes his adviser Cadsuane Melaidhrin for not securing the Domination Band, promising to kill her if he sees her face again.|$|E
5|$|The third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, follows Harry in {{his third}} year of magical education. It is the only book in the series which does not feature Lord Voldemort in any form. Instead, Harry must deal with the {{knowledge}} that he has been targeted by Sirius Black, his father's best friend, and, according to the Wizarding World, an escaped mass murderer who assisted in the murder of Harry's parents. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors – dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul and feed on despair – which are ostensibly protecting the school, <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> to Remus Lupin, a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who is eventually revealed to be a werewolf. Lupin teaches Harry defensive measures which are well above the level of magic generally executed by people his age. Harry comes to know that both Lupin and Black were best friends of his father and that Black was framed by their fourth friend, Peter Pettigrew, who had been hiding as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. In this book, a recurring theme throughout the series is emphasised – in every book there is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, none of whom lasts more than one school year.|$|E
500|$|When James and Kristen awaken, it is morning, {{and they}} are tied to chairs {{in the living room}} with the masked strangers {{standing}} before them. Kristen asks them why they are doing this, to which the blonde woman replies, [...] "because you were home". The strangers then unmask themselves to the couple offscreen, and take turns stabbing the couple in the stomach and chest before leaving. They drive past two young boys on bicycles who are distributing religious tracts. Dollface asks for a tract. The boy asks if she's a sinner and she replies, [...] "sometimes". The strangers drive away, as the pin-up girl states, [...] "it'll be easier next time". The two boys come upon the house and discover the chaotic scene, including the bodies of Kristen, James and Mike inside. One boy approaches Kristen's body, and as <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> to her, she wakes up and screams.|$|E

2500|$|Their {{journey is}} {{interrupted}} when their steam-powered vessel is waylaid by the outlaw petrol-powered motorcycle gang, the Black Avengers. Jaggar, however, senses {{that these men}} may be of use to his cause and challenges their leader, Stag Stopa. The rules of the Black Avengers only allow a member to challenge the leader, and so he and Bogel are taken back to their headquarters for Feric to be initiated. Feric acquits himself mainly in the drinking of ale and in running the gauntlet of torches on a motorcycle. He and Stopa duel with truncheons, and Feric's truncheon breaks. Desperately <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> and defeats Stopa with the legendary [...] "Great Truncheon of Stag Held"—which can only be wielded by a descendant of the last true King of Heldon, Sigmark IV. The Black Avengers immediately pledge fealty to him, and become the [...] "Knights of the Swastika".|$|E
2500|$|Randy is {{suffering}} from severe constipation and {{has been unable to}} defecate for more than three weeks. After taking a laxative, Randy produces an abnormally large piece of excrement during an extremely painful bowel movement. Believing he has passed the world's biggest stool, <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> to the [...] "European Fecal Standards and Measurements" [...] office, headquartered in Zürich, Switzerland. The institute concludes he has the world record, weighing in at 8.6 courics – a fictional measurement unit (approximately 2.5 pounds) named after journalist Katie Couric. As Randy is the first American to ever receive the award, the American government holds a ceremony to honor his achievement. However, it is interrupted by a video of Bono, the previous record holder, claiming he has just taken a crap weighing 9.5 courics, and is therefore still the record holder. His claim is accepted, despite protests that his only proof is an unverified photo.|$|E

2500|$|That night, Charlie Brown {{is still}} sad {{that he has}} not {{discovered}} {{what it means to be}} a [...] "good man", then he discovers a pencil which has been dropped by the Little Red-Haired Girl (his perennial crush).

[...] With that realization, he concludes that today hasn't been so bad, after all, and he's done a lot of things that make him happy. As Charlie Brown expresses what makes him happy, everyone, touched by his love of life, begin to express what makes them happy as well ("Happiness"). Right then, he realizes being a [...] "good man" [...] means trying your best and making the most of the things you've been given in life. As his other friends leave the stage, Lucy turns to him and puts out her hand, making him shrink back.

2500|$|Jimmy Page is filmed {{sitting by}} a lake {{next to his}} 18th century manor at Plumpton, East Sussex, playing a hurdy-gurdy. The tune played is called [...] "Autumn Lake" [...] and the scene was filmed in October 1973. Page's fantasy role {{involved}} climbing up {{the face of a}} snow-capped mountain near Boleskine House, Loch Ness during the nights of a full moon on December 10 and 11, 1973. The act was meant to show Page on a quest of self-enlightenment, and deep understanding, by seeking out the Hermit, a character featured in many Tarot packs. The mythological Hermit is seen on the summit of the mountain; Staff of Wisdom in one hand, and in the other, the Lantern of Knowledge held out abreast over the world below. Being a Threshold Guardian, he represents an obstacle the seeker must overcome to achieve true enlightenment. At the culmination of Page's quest, <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> to touch The Hermit, only to discover paradoxically that the Hermit is himself. The Hermit features on the artwork of the untitled fourth album. The thematic music is [...] "Dazed and Confused." ...|$|E

60|$|Nor is food all, nor drink, nor work, nor open air. There {{has spread}} abroad {{along with the}} {{so-called}} physical efficiency a perfect passion for information. Somehow if a man's stomach is empty and his head clear as a bell, and if he won't drink and won't smoke, <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> for information. He wants facts. He reads the newspapers all though, instead of only reading the headings. He clamours for articles filled with statistics about illiteracy and alien immigration {{and the number of}} battleships in the Japanese navy.|$|E
6000|$|Father, I think thou knowest my resolve, And {{with this}} nobler vengeance art content. Father, I think in letting this man live That I am doing what thou wouldst have done. Father, I know not if a human voice Can pierce the iron gateway of the dead, Or if {{the dead are}} set in ignorance Of what we do, or do not, for their sakes. And yet I feel a {{presence}} in the air, There is a shadow standing at my side, And ghostly kisses seem to touch my lips, And leave them holier. [Kneels down.] O father, if 'tis thou, Canst thou not burst through the decrees of death, And if corporeal semblance show thyself, That I may touch thy hand! No, there is nothing. [Rises.] 'Tis the night that cheats us with its phantoms, And, like a puppet-master, makes us think That things are real which are not. It grows late. Now must I to my business. [Pulls out a letter from his doublet and reads it.] When he wakes, And sees this letter, and the dagger with it, Will he not have some loathing for his life, Repent, perchance, and lead a better life, Or will he mock because a young man spared His natural enemy? I do not care. Father, it is thy bidding that I do, Thy bidding, and the bidding of my love Which teaches me to know thee as thou art. [Ascends staircase stealthily, and just as <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> <b>out</b> his hand to draw back the curtain the Duchess appears all in white. GUIDO starts back.] ...|$|E
