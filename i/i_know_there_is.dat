25|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} onwards, New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF), based out of Brigham Young University, has {{sponsored}} archaeological excavations in Mesoamerica, {{with a focus}} on the Mesoamerican time period known as the Preclassic (earlier than c. AD 200). The results of these and other investigations, while producing valuable archaeological data, have not led to any widespread acceptance by non-Mormon archaeologists of the Book of Mormon account. Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, wrote, As far as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing the historicity of the Book of Mormon, and I would like to state that {{there are quite a few}} Mormon archaeologists who join this group.|$|E

The Presidential Guard of Mahmoud Abbas was enlarged and equipped, and its members trained by the US, Egypt and Jordan. [...] Also, a PLC council member for Hamas, Anwar Zaboun, believes that ″Mohammed Dahlan had a big plan to remove the roots of Hamas, the resistance, in Gaza and the West Bank″.- ″In terms of the reconciliation, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a veto from the United States of America and the European Union.

2500|$|When fellow Congressman Todd Akin made {{inappropriate}} {{comments about}} female biology, Bartlett immediately repudiated them, adding [...] "There {{is no room}} in politics for these types of statements...As a human physiologist <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no scientific backing to Todd's claims." [...] He said his view on abortion exceptions has been [...] "he same for twenty years. I'm pro-life, with exceptions {{for the life of}} the mother, rape and incest...I'm so avidly pro-life I'm against corporal punishment", later adding that a very small proportion of [...] abortions are a result of rape; however, in 2001 Bartlett had supported a constitutional amendment which did not include the rape and incest exceptions. [...] "The Maryland Democratic Party went after Bartlett", trying to connect Todd Akin's comments to Bartlett.|$|E
2500|$|Because Voris is {{the owner}} of St. Michael's Media, and had {{contracted}} with Marc Brammer's RealCatholicTV run from South Bend, Indiana (which is under the authority of Bishop Kevin Rhoades), a question of jurisdiction under canon law arose. Brammer noted he had received a letter from the Archdiocese of Detroit acknowledging him as the owner of the website and its name. He responded to the letter by requesting a meeting but got no response. Brammer personally met with Bishop Rhoades, who reassured him that he had no problem with the name RealCatholicTV.com. Voris held that he had made seven attempts to set up a meeting with the archbishop on the matter and had been rebuffed or ignored on each occasion. When asked by reporters if the diocese Marc Brammer lives in had any problems with RealCatholicTV, Fr. Mark Gurtner, judicial vicar of the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend in Indiana, responded, [...] "No, as far as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> nothing." [...] Gurtner went on, stating that speaking as a canon lawyer (and not speaking on behalf of the diocese) it was his opinion that as the owner of the website lived in Indiana, they had jurisdiction over the matter rather than Detroit. In response, the Archdiocese of Detroit cited its own canon lawyer, Ed Peters (a professor at the local Sacred Heart Major Seminary), who maintained that Detroit was on [...] "firm ground" [...] in its actions concerning Voris.|$|E
