5|$|If {{a player}} is dealt {{a pair of}} eights, the total of 16 is {{considered}} a troublesome hand. In fact, the value 16 {{is said to be}} the worst hand one can have in blackjack. Since sixteen of the other fifty cards have a value of 10 and four have a value of 11, there is a strong chance of getting at least an 18 with either or both split cards. A hand totaling 18 or 19 is much stronger than having a 16. Splitting eights limits one's losses and improves one's hand. Probabilistic research of expected value scenarios shows that by splitting eights one can convert a hand that presents an <b>expected</b> <b>loss</b> to two hands that may present an expected profit or a reduced loss, depending on what the dealer is showing. A split pair of eights is expected to win against dealer upcards of 2 through 7 and to lose less against dealer upcards of 8 through ace. If a player hits on a pair of eights, he is expected to lose $52 for a $100 bet. If the player splits the eights, he is expected to lose only $43 for a $100 bet.|$|E
5|$|Uncovered {{interest}} rate parity asserts that an investor with dollar deposits will earn the {{interest rate}} available on dollar deposits, while an investor holding euro deposits will earn {{the interest rate}} available in the eurozone, but also a potential gain or loss on euros depending on the rate of appreciation or depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Economists have extrapolated a useful approximation of uncovered interest rate parity that follows intuitively from these assumptions. If uncovered interest rate parity holds, such that an investor is indifferent between dollar versus euro deposits, then any excess return on euro deposits must be offset by some <b>expected</b> <b>loss</b> from depreciation of the euro against the dollar. Conversely, some shortfall in return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected gain from appreciation of the euro against the dollar. The following equation represents the uncovered interest rate parity approximation.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The paper {{attempts}} {{to analyze the}} volatility of returns and <b>expected</b> <b>losses</b> of Islamic bank financing. In particular, it takes the case of Indonesian Islamic banking industry. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses Value at Risk (VaR) approach to compute the volatility (risk) of returns and <b>expected</b> <b>losses</b> of Islamic bank financing. In particular, it uses variance-covariance method to calculate VaR of multi-asset portfolios (groups of equity-, debt- and service-based financing). Findings – First of all, equity and debt-based financing produce sustainable returns of bank financing. Moreover, they are also very resilient during unfavorable economic conditions. Second, the performance of service-based financing is very sensitive to the economic conditions. Lastly, VaR computation on the volatility of returns and <b>expected</b> <b>losses</b> of bank financing finds that risk of investment and <b>expected</b> <b>losses</b> are well managed. Practical implications – The paper demands Islamic banks to keep intensifying equity-based financing rather than only debt-based financing and improve the banking services to support the performance of service-based financing. Originality/value – To {{the best of the}} author's knowledge, this is the first paper to assist the volatility of returns and <b>expected</b> <b>losses</b> of the Islamic banking financing in Indonesian.

Because of its use of optimization, the mathematical theory of statistics shares concerns with other decision sciences, such as operations research, control theory, and mathematical economics.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} implicit guarantees and capital regulations {{on the behavior of}} a bank and on the <b>expected</b> <b>losses</b> for its depositors. I show that implicit guarantees increase the incentives of the bank to enhance leverage and/or risk taking and that this leads to higher <b>expected</b> <b>losses</b> for its depositors. To reduce the adverse effects of moral hazard, policy measures have to be taken. However, a simple leverage ratio is likely to increase <b>expected</b> <b>losses</b> further and risk adjusted capital requirements do not necessarily affect highly leveraged banks with very low risk assets. A combination of both requirements can be successful. Positive long-term effects can be achieved by a reduction of moral hazard and informational imperfections. However, it is difficult to achieve these reductions and potentially severe short-term effects have to be taken into account...|$|R
25|$|In {{decision}} theory, and {{in particular}} in choice under uncertainty, an agent is described as making an optimal choice {{in the context of}} incomplete information. For risk neutral agents, the choice involves using the expected values of uncertain quantities, while for risk averse agents it involves maximizing the expected value of some objective function such as a von Neumann–Morgenstern utility function. One example of using expected value in reaching optimal decisions is the Gordon–Loeb model of information security investment. According to the model, one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be {{only a small fraction of}} the <b>expected</b> <b>loss</b> (i.e., the expected value of the loss resulting from a cyber/information security breach).|$|E
25|$|Because a Bayesian {{network is}} a {{complete}} model for the variables and their relationships, {{it can be used}} to answer probabilistic queries about them. For example, the network can be used to find out updated knowledge of the state of a subset of variables when other variables (the evidence variables) are observed. This process of computing the posterior distribution of variables given evidence is called probabilistic inference. The posterior gives a universal sufficient statistic for detection applications, when one wants to choose values for the variable subset which minimize some <b>expected</b> <b>loss</b> function, for instance the probability of decision error. A Bayesian network can thus be considered a mechanism for automatically applying Bayes' theorem to complex problems.|$|E
25|$|To {{determine}} a bond's rating, a credit rating agency analyzes {{the accounts of}} the issuer and the legal agreements attached to the bond to produce what is effectively a forecast of the bond's chance of default, <b>expected</b> <b>loss,</b> or a similar metric. The metrics vary somewhat between the agencies. S's ratings reflect default probability, while ratings by Moody's reflect expected investor losses {{in the case of}} default. For corporate obligations, Fitch's ratings incorporate a measure of investor loss in the event of default, but its ratings on structured, project, and public finance obligations narrowly measure default risk. The process and criteria for rating a convertible bond are similar, although different enough that bonds and convertible bonds issued by the same entity may still receive different ratings. Some bank loans may receive ratings to assist in wider syndication and attract institutional investors.|$|E
