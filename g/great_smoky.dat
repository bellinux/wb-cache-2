25|$|Trunk {{volume is}} the third {{dimension}} to receive attention by ENTS. Many eastern hemlocks have been modeled to over 30m³ trunk volume, and the largest has been calculated to be 44.8 m³, making it the largest natural evergreen conifer in the eastern United States.

25|$|The Blue Ridge area lies on {{the eastern}} edge of Tennessee, {{bordering}} North Carolina. This region of Tennessee is characterized by the high mountains and rugged terrain of the western Blue Ridge Mountains, which are subdivided into several subranges, namely the <b>Great</b> <b>Smoky</b> Mountains, the Bald Mountains, the Unicoi Mountains, the Unaka Mountains and Roan Highlands, and the Iron Mountains.|$|E
25|$|Pignut hickory {{frequently}} {{grows on}} dry ridgetops and sideslopes throughout its range {{but it is}} also common on moist sites, particularly in the mountains and Piedmont. In the <b>Great</b> <b>Smoky</b> Mountains pignut hickory has been observed on dry sandy soils at low elevations. Whittaker (27) placed pignut in a submesic class and charted it as ranging up to 1480 m (4,850ft)-the hickory with the greatest elevational range in the <b>Great</b> <b>Smoky</b> Mountains. In southwest Virginia, south-facing upper slopes from 975 to 1050 m (3,200 to 3,445ft) of Beanfield Mountain are dominated by pignut hickory, northern red oak Quercus rubra), and white oak (Q. alba). This site is the most xeric habitat on the mountain because of high insolation, 70 percent slopes, and medium- to coarse-textured soils derived from Clinch sandstone. Mid-elevation slopes from 800 to 975 m (2,625 to 3,200ft) are dominated by chestnut oak (Q. prinus), northern red oak, and pignut hickory and coincide with three shale formations (12).|$|E

25|$|The worst {{recorded}} fatality {{incident occurred}} in May 1978, {{in which a}} black bear killed three teenagers fishing in Algonquin Park in Canada. The majority of attacks happened in national parks, usually near campgrounds, where the bears had become habituated to human contact and food. 1028 incidences of black bears acting aggressively toward people, 107 of which resulted in injury, were recorded from 1964 to 1976 in the <b>Great</b> <b>Smoky</b> Mountains National Park, and occurred mainly in tourist hotspots, where people regularly fed the bears handouts.|$|E
25|$|Junaluska {{salamanders}} {{have only}} {{been found in the}} Blue Ridge Mountain area in the Cheoah River, Santeetlah Creek, and Tululah Creek in Graham County of North Carolina. They are also found in a limited number of creeks in the <b>Great</b> <b>Smoky</b> Mountains National Park, Sevier County, Tennessee. These salamanders are very rarely encountered in either area. One looking for this species is more likely to find E. junaluska in larger rocky streams in colder weather. Another popular way of spotting this species is late-night driving along roads on rainy nights. They can be seen moving between the terrestrial habitat they inhabit and the areas where they breed.|$|E
