The chemical structures of these chemicals all closely resemble one another, with the compounds containing an identical imidazolinone ring structure with a carboxylic acid group {{attached to the}} backbone. They vary only in the attached ring structure. These six herbicides kill plants by inhibiting acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS). AHAS is the first enzyme in the branched-chain amino acid pathway that eventually ends in the synthesis of amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{herbicides}} {{that have}} been used with the best success on S. minima include the ingredients fluridone, <b>imazamox,</b> and penoxsulam. Some of these herbicides kill S. minima more successfully when a surfactant is added to make the chemicals stick {{to the surface of the}} leaves. Though herbicides are effective in controlling S. minima, they can have adverse effects. Herbicides can kill or cause harm to native organisms that are not the intended target. Also, if a large area of S. minima is sprayed with an herbicide all at once, the dead plant matter will sink into the water and decompose, which can deplete oxygen in the water and result in fish kills. Smaller sections can be sprayed at a time to combat this side effect.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWheat {{is a major}} world crop. Wheat {{production}} is actually decreased {{by the emergence of}} herbicide-resistant weeds commonly found in wheat fields. The need to control these weeds has led to the use of herbicides, such as imidazolinones, that are not typically used in wheat fields. As a consequence, a new wheat cultivar, the Clearfield® wheat Pandora variety, has been developed to be resistant to imidazolinones. Actually, only few mechanisms of resistance are known. Here, we studied non-target mechanisms and the resistance to <b>imazamox</b> for susceptible and resistant cultivars, under greenhouse and laboratory conditions. Our results show a resistance factor of 14. 3. We observed that the acetolactate synthase enzyme in the resistant cultivar showed resistance to <b>imazamox.</b> We found also variable cross-resistance to all tested imidazolinone herbicides. Metabolism studies showed a high conversion of <b>imazamox</b> to two metabolites in the resistant cultivar. We also observed a similar penetration of <b>imazamox</b> in both cultivars and a high translocation of <b>imazamox</b> to the root in the susceptible cultivar. Results on cytochrome P 450 suggest that the principal resistance mechanism is not in its metabolism. This is the first study on the metabolism of <b>imazamox</b> in Clearfield® wheat cultivars...|$|E

They {{have been on the}} market for a few years, especially in North America. To determine if <b>imazamox,</b> an imidazolinone herbicide, and IMI-resistant oilseed rape cultivars are suitable for cultivation in Finland, we conducted four herbicide trials in three locations. We found, that <b>imazamox</b> had no negative effect on yield or oil quality characters of IMI-resistant oilseed rape. Some transient chlorosis was observed immediately after the treatment, but it was not apparent after a few days. The effects of <b>imazamox</b> against the most troublesome weeds in oilseed field in Finland, Chenopodium album and Galium spurium, were very good. <b>Imazamox</b> had good or moderate effects on Stellaria media, whereas its effects on Viola arvensis, Lapsana communis and Fallopia convolvulus were insufficient. If the total weed number was high or the emergence of oilseed rape was slow, the application of <b>imazamox</b> increased the yield of oilseed rape compared to untreated control. Our results suggest that <b>imazamox</b> is a good alternative in controlling weeds for Finnish oilseed fields.

Glyphosate applied to alfalfa at the unifoliate growth stage provided 67 % weed control and {{was similar to}} <b>imazamox</b> applied at the two-trifoliate leaf stage. Delaying glyphosate application until alfalfa had reached the two-trifoliate growth stage improved weed control to 83 %, and weed control was similar to <b>imazamox</b> plus 2, 4 -DB and imazethapyr plus 2, 4 -DB. <b>Imazamox</b> and imazethapyr caused minor crop injury, {{and the addition of}} bromoxynil or 2, 4 -DB to both herbicides further decreased crop safety. Weeds were most competitive with the first forage harvest and reduced relative feed value, crude protein, and value (dollars per t) of forage compared to forage that had been treated with herbicides. The total forage yield for the season consisted of three forage harvests and was greatest when no herbicides were applied. The total forage yield of plots treated with glyphosate at the two-trifoliate growth stage was greater than that of plots treated with <b>imazamox</b> or imazethapyr in combination with bromoxynil.

Two studies were conducted in 2006 and 2007 in Saskatchewan with the research objective of determining the optimal weed control timing and herbicide to maximize weed control and lentil yield. The first experiment investigated the critical period of weed control (CPWC) for lentil. The CPWC was realized by investigating two components; the duration of weed interference and the duration of the weed-free period which respectively determine {{the beginning and end of}} the CPWC. The crop remained weedy or weed-free from zero to eleven lentil nodes to investigate the durations of weed interference and weed-free period. There was an inverse relationship between weed biomass and lentil yield such that lentil yield was highest when weed biomass was minimal. The CPWC was found to commence at the five node stage and continue to the ten node stage. The second experiment investigated imazethapyr / <b>imazamox,</b> <b>imazamox</b> and metribuzin + sethoxydim applied at two application times to determine the best herbicide for the CPWC. The results indicated that imazethapyr / <b>imazamox</b> and <b>imazamox</b> applied at the six node stage resulted in the overall lowest weed biomass and highest lentil yield compared to application at the two node stage.

A field trial was conducted to identify alternative herbicides for the management of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) -inhibiting herbicide-resistant smooth barley in field pea. Preplant (PP) soil applications of pyroxasulfone; prosulfocarb plus S-metolachlor; dimethenamid-P; propyzamide; trifluralin alone or with triallate or with diuron; or <b>imazamox</b> applied POST were evaluated for their effectiveness and crop safety. Propyzamide, pyroxasulfone, or <b>imazamox</b> applied POST provided a high level of smooth barley control, did not cause any crop injury, and increased field pea grain or forage yield compared with the nontreated. Furthermore, propyzamide or pyroxasulfone reduced panicle density and seed production in smooth barley, whereas the effectiveness of POST <b>imazamox</b> varied over the two seasons. Dimethenamid-P reduced the impact of smooth barley on field pea yield, but cause stunting, and was less effective than propyzamide, pyroxasulfone, and <b>imazamox</b> in reducing smooth barley seed production. Negative relationship between field pea yield and smooth barley panicle density indicated that smooth barley is highly competitive in field pea crops and can cause large yield losses. The results of this investigation suggest that propyzamide or pyroxasulfone applied PP and <b>imazamox</b> applied POST could be used effectively in the field for the management of ACCase-inhibiting herbicide-resistant smooth barley in South Australia.

Target and non-target mechanisms of resistance were studied to characterize the resistance of Pantera and to identify the importance of each mechanism involved in this resistance. Pantera is resistant to <b>imazamox</b> as was determined in previous experiments. The molecular study confirmed that it carries a mutation Ser-Asn 627 conferring resistance to <b>imazamox</b> in {{two out of three}} acetolactate synthase (ALS) genes (imi 1 and imi 2), located in wheat on chromosomes 6 B and 6 D, respectively. However, the last gene (imi 3) located on chromosome 6 A does not carry any mutation conferring resistance. As a result, photosynthetic activity and chlorophyll content were reduced after <b>imazamox</b> treatment. Detoxification was higher in the resistant biotype as shown by metabolomic study while <b>imazamox</b> translocation was higher in the susceptible cultivar. Interestingly, <b>imazamox</b> metabolism was higher at higher doses of herbicide, which suggests that the detoxification process is an inducible mechanism in which the upregulation of key gene coding for detoxification enzymes could play an important role. Thus, the identification of cultivars with a higher detoxification potential would allow the development of more resistant varieties. We thank Rafael A.

However, two selection treatments would add an additional level of confidence should a single herbicide treatment not be completely effective (i. e. some heterozygous plants survived). Treating segregating populations for FS 2 gene with 2 x of <b>imazamox</b> herbicide causes plants to die and hence reduced plant density. Like many other studies in wheat, reduction of plant density caused a delay in flowering; and a reduction in plant height, grain yield, and grain volume weight. However once the susceptible and heterozygous plants are removed, the populations after spraying have full stand density and can be treated as ‘normal’ population for agronomic selection. ...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{observations}} from field systems suggest that RiceBeaux? may enhance efficacy of imidazolinone herbicides {{for control of}} red rice. Therefore, this research was undertaken to evaluate the herbicidal interactions of RiceBeaux? with Newpath? and Beyond?. Field experiments were conducted in 2012 and 2013 at the David R. Wintermann Rice Research Station in Eagle Lake, TX. In both years, imazethapyr alone and imazethapyr+RiceBeaux? treatments, were evaluated for control of XL 723, which was used to simulate red rice in the field. In 2012, imazethapyr alone treatments provided 60 to 85 % control of XL 723 14 DAT and 87 to 100 % control 21 DAT. Imazethapyr+RiceBeaux? combinations provided 51 to 91 % control of XL 723 14 DAT and 87 to 100 % control 21 DAT. During both years, all treatments provided greater than 98 % control of XL 723 28 and 35 DAT. In 2013, treatments that {{did not include a}} tank-mix with RiceBeaux? provided 60 to 77 % control of XL 723 14 DAT and 80 to 94 % control 21 DAT. Imazethapyr+RiceBeaux? combinations provided 60 to 85 % control of XL 723 14 DAT and 81 to 99 % control 21 DAT. These data indicated that for both years, Imazethapyr+RiceBeaux? combinations provided no additional control of XL 723 compared to imazethapyr alone. In 2013, experiments were conducted to evaluate the interaction of RiceBeaux? on <b>imazamox</b> in the field. <b>Imazamox</b> alone provided 62 to 75 % and 87 to 94 % control of XL 723 14 and 21 DAT, respectively. Imazamox+RiceBeaux? treatments provided 57 to 85 % control 14 DAT and 86 to 100 % control 21 DAT. All treatments provided excellent control 28 and 35 DAT. Based on these data, imazamox+RiceBeaux? combinations provided no additional control of XL 723 compared to <b>imazamox</b> alone. Laboratory experiments were also conducted to characterize the interaction of RiceBeaux? on translocation and absorption of <b>imazamox</b> using ^(14) C-imazamox. TX- 4 red rice plants were treated with ^(14) C-imazamox, with plants subsequently harvested at 8 separate timings. At each harvest timing, six samples were harvested from each plant and analyzed using Liquid Scintillation Spectrometry to quantify radioactivity. Significantly more ^(14) C-imazamox was recovered from the cuticle when <b>imazamox</b> was applied alone, resulting in lower amounts of <b>imazamox</b> absorption. In contrast, imazamox+RiceBeaux? resulted in significantly higher absorption of ^(14) C-imazamox at 24, 48, and 96 hr after treatment. Results indicated RiceBeaux? may allow more <b>imazamox</b> to cross the lipophilic cuticle to reach the sites of action, which may result in enhanced red rice control.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of AgronomyPhillip W. StahlmanSeveral weed species infest {{sunflower}} fields, but herbicidal {{options for}} broadleaf weed control are limited. In recent years, <b>imazamox</b> and tribenuron herbicides have been registered for POST use in imidazolinone-tolerant and tribenuron-tolerant sunflowers, respectively. Objectives {{of this study}} were to 1) investigate the effects of soil nitrogen level on Palmer amaranth control with <b>imazamox</b> in imidazolinone-tolerant sunflower and 2) evaluate crop response and weed control efficacy of single and sequential applications of tribenuron at two rates and the effectiveness of preemergence herbicides followed by postemergence tribenuron in tribenuron-tolerant sunflower. Greenhouse experiments were conducted in Manhattan, KS and field experiments were conducted near Hays, KS in 2007 and 2008. For the first objective, treatments consisted of a factorial arrangement of three soil nitrogen levels (28, 56, and 84 kg/ha) and two <b>imazamox</b> rates (26 and 35 g ai/ha) in a RCBD. Palmer amaranth growth rate increased with increasing soil nitrogen level. In all experiments, plants grown at the highest soil nitrogen level exceeded the maximum recommended plant height (7. 6 cm) by > 35 % at the time of <b>imazamox</b> application. Generally, <b>imazamox</b> rates did not differ in control effectiveness at the 56 kg/ha soil nitrogen level, but the higher 35 g/ha rate was superior to the lower rate at the 84 kg/ha soil nitrogen level because of greater weed size. For the second objective, tribenuron was applied singly at 9 and 18 g/ha, sequentially in all combinations of those rates, and singly at those rates following PRE herbicide treatments. In general, tribenuron at 18 g/ha applied with methylated seed oil adjuvant before weeds exceeded 10 cm in height provided excellent control of most species with insignificant injury to the crop. The need for supplemental PRE herbicides for weed control in tribenuron-tolerant sunflower depends on weed species present and their size at the time of tribenuron application...|$|E

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Agronomy. The development of Imidazolinone (IMI) Resistant (IR) rice now allows rice producers to selectively control red rice (Oryza sativa, O. rufipogon, and O. nivara), weedy relatives of commercial rice (O. sativa). Imazethapyr the primary herbicide used with this technology {{has been shown to be}} relatively persistent in the soil and may cause injury to rotational crops including non-IR rice. <b>Imazamox</b> has less soil persistence in non-flooded environments; however, this herbicide has not been studied in rice environments including flooded soils. Thirteen selected treatments of two and three sequential applications of imazethapyr and <b>imazamox</b> were applied to IR rice in 2004 and 2005. In 2005 and 2006, non-IR rice was planted into the previous years' plots to evaluate herbicide carryover. Studies were conducted on two soils commonly utilized for rice production: a DeWitt silt loam and a Sharkey clay soil. Treatments included several variations including common programs with <b>imazamox</b> added, double-rate treatments, and imazamox-only treatments and treatments where <b>imazamox</b> was substituted for imazethapyr. Non-IR rice was evaluated for carryover injury at preflood and 2 -week postflood timings. No injury was observed on the silt loam soil in 2005 or on the clay soil in 2006. The addition of <b>imazamox</b> at the preflood in 2005 on the clay soil to any treatment was the main factor increasing injury to significant levels. In 2006 on the silt loam soil, doubling the imazethapyr rate was the main factor increasing injury. However, in all cases, injury was low and in some instances treatments that caused or did not cause injury did not correlate to the herbicide rates applied. To further investigate imidazolinone dissipation, imazethapyr, <b>imazamox</b> and imazapyr were applied to flooded and non-flooded plots on silt loam and clay soils. Soil damples were taken periodically during the year following application. Samples were frozen to stop dissipation. Soil samples were tested using a bioassay and standard curve. From this information, dissipation rates and half lives were estimated. Visual injury was found to provide the best measurement of herbicide quantity in the soil. Half lives for <b>imazamox</b> were found to be 16 d on flooded silt loam, 8 d on flooded clay. Half lives were longer under non-flooded conditions with half lives of 270 and 13 d being calculated on silt loam and clay soils. Imazethapyr half lives ranged from 5 d on flooded clay to 128 d on nonflooded loam. Half lives calculated for imazapyr ranged from 8 to 78 d under flooded and non-flooded conditions on the clay soil, and from 50 to 539 d on the silt loam soil. The active herbicide concentrations declined more quickly under flooded conditions as compared to non-flooded conditions, regardless of soil type. However, dissipation occurred faster on the clay soil as compared to the silt loam...|$|E
40|$|Competition {{control is}} {{essential}} for successful eucalyptus plantation establishment, yet few selective herbicides have been identified. Five herbicides, flumioxazin, <b>imazamox,</b> imazapic, oxyfluorfen, and sulfometuron methyl, were evaluated for selective weed control {{in the establishment of}} genetically modified frost tolerant Eucalyptus urograndis clones. Herbicides were applied at two or three rates, either before or after weed emergence, and compared to a nontreated control and to near-complete weed control obtained with glyphosate directed sprays. Applications prior to weed emergence were most effective for weed control and, with the exception of imazapic, all resulted in enhanced eucalyptus growth relative to the nontreated control. Among postemergent treatments, only <b>imazamox</b> enhanced stem volume. Among selective herbicide treatments, preemergent 2240 [*]g[*]ha− 1 oxyfluorfen produced the best growth response, resulting in stem volume index that was 860 % greater than the nontreated control, although only 15 % of the volume index obtained with near-complete weed control. Imazapic was the most phytotoxic of all herbicides, resulting in 40 % mortality when applied preemergent. Survival was 100 % for all other herbicide treatments. This research found the previously nontested herbicides <b>imazamox</b> and imazapic to be effective for selective weed control and refined application rate and timing of five herbicides for use in clonal plantations...|$|E
40|$|Experiments, in Petri {{dish and}} greenhouse, {{were carried out}} to {{investigate}} the efficiency of three herbicides (rimsulfuron, imazapic and <b>imazamox)</b> in controling broomrape. In Petri dish study, herbicides were applied at 0. 05, 0. 25, 1. 25, 6. 25 and 31. 25 micro-mole doses to broomrape seeds at germination stage without a host plant and adding GR 24 as stimulator. In the greenhouse experiments, the efficiency of these herbicides to control broomrape in two varieties of tomato (Viva and Hyb. Petopride II) was investigated. Treatments were four doses of rimsulfuron (25, 50, 75 and 100 g ai/ha), imazapic (5, 10, 15 and 20 g ai/ha) and <b>imazamox</b> (0. 4, 0. 8, 1. 2 and 1. 6 g ai/ha) at one, two and three applications. Results of Petri-dish experiments showed that rimsulfuron and imazapic significantly reduced radicle elongation of seedlings {{as compared to the}} control, while, <b>imazamox</b> did not have any effect on broomrape seed. Each dose was applied for one, two and three times with in 15, 29 and 43 days after within transplanting tomato seedlings. Results of pot experiments indicated that the responses of two tomato varieties herbicides were different. Viva was responsive to herbicidal effect and produced higher biomass than Hyb. Petopride II. Rimsulfuron was a suitable herbicide in tomato to control broomrape. Rimsulfuron at doses of 25, 50 and 75 g ai/ha (three times of application) were the best doses, specially in viva were the best treatments for broomrape control and producing tomato biomass.

40|$|The {{application}} of <b>imazamox</b> as an herbicide in oilseed-rape got possible {{due to the}} introduction of Clearfield oilseed-rape varieties which are tolerant to ALS inhibitors. The question of this investigation was, if the broader use of ALS-inhibitors increases the selection pressure on herbicide resistant weeds and increases their occurrence in the crop rotation. An outdoor container trial with 30 containers (350 l, 0, 7 m²) was performed, starting in autumn 2011. A winter wheat – oilseed-rape rotation was simulated for four years. Three different black-grass biotypes with different resistance pattern and 5 different herbicide programmes were analysed in this study in order to investigate the population dynamics of target-site resistance (TSR) and the development of metabolic resistance. The trials showed interactions between the black-grass biotype and the herbicide strategy on the increase of the black-grass density. There was no interaction due to the use of propyzamide. The frequency of target-site resistance to ACCase inhibitors increased for the corresponding biotypes independently of the herbicide strategy during the trial period. The low frequency of ALS-TSR at trial start did not change during the trial period, independently of the use of <b>imazamox</b> in the oil-seed rape cultivation. The comparison of the resistance factors between the original biotypes and the seeds harvested after the four year container trial showed increasing resistances against pinoxaden for all biotypes. Within the different black-grass biotypes there was a slightly decrease as well as an increase in <b>imazamox</b> efficacy observed. There was no significant increase of meso- + iodosulfuron resistance compared to the original biotypes from 2011 caused by different herbicide treatments. The results indicated that the integration of <b>imazamox</b> tolerant oilseed rape in winter wheat crop rotations did not necessarily increase the development of herbicide resistant black-grass...|$|E
