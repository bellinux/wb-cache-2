40|$|We {{focus on}} the {{evaluation}} of the applicability of the classical and well-established linear polarimeter to the measurement of linear retardance in the presence of phase flicker. This analysis shows that there are large errors in the results provided by the linear polarimeter when measuring the linear retardance of a device. These errors depend on the specific retardance value under measurement. We show that there are some points where this limitation can be used to measure the fluctuation amplitude consistently. An elegant method is further proposed, enabling the measurement of the average retardance value, thus extending the applicability of the classical linear polarimeter. Experimental characterization results are provided for various <b>electrical</b> sequences <b>addressed</b> onto a parallel aligned liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) display. Good agreement is obtained with experiment, thus validating the linear polarimeter methodology proposed.

In the present paper, the electroactive biomolecule microperoxidase- 11 (MP- 11) was integrated into metal-bridge-metal (MBM) junctions assembled from a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) setup. Before immobilization of MP- 11, the Au working electrode was first modified by a self-assembled monolayer of 1 -undecanethiol (UDT). A symmetric and potential independent response of current-bias voltage (I(t) /V(b)) was observed for the Au (substrate) /UDT/Au (tip) junction. However, the I(t) /V(b) characteristics became potential dependent and asymmetrical after binding of MP- 11 between the electrodes of the junction. The rectification ratio of the asymmetric current response varies with gate electrode modulation. A resonant tunneling process between metal electrode and MP- 11 enhances the tunneling current and is responsible for the observed rectification.

These efforts are partly motivated by the resulting desirable features, such as transport along edge states that is robust against backscattering. We analyze how the optomechanical interaction between photons and mechanical vibrations can be used to create artificial magnetic fields for photons on a lattice. The ingredients required are an optomechanical crystal, i. e., a free-standing photonic crystal with localized vibrational and optical modes, and two laser beams with the right pattern of phases. One of the two schemes analyzed here is based on optomechanical modulation of the links between optical modes, while the other is a lattice extension of optomechanical wavelength-conversion setups. We analyze both schemes theoretically and present numerical simulations of the resulting optical spectrum, photon transport in the presence of an artificial Lorentz force, edge states, and the photonic Aharonov Bohm effect.

The effect of mechanical stimulation is well studied in organs and tissues, for instance by using flexible tissue culture substrates that can be stretched by external means. However, on the cellular and subcellular level, dedicated technology to apply appropriate mechanical stimuli is limited. Here we report an organic electronic microactuator chip for mechanical stimulation of single cells. These chips are manufactured on silicon wafers using traditional microfabrication and photolithography techniques. The active unit of the chip consists of the electroactive polymer polypyrrole that expands upon {{the application of a}} low potential. The fact that polypyrrole can be activated in physiological electrolytes makes it well suited as the active material in a microactuator chip for biomedical applications.

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{properties of}} CdSe quantum dots with electrochemically inactive surface ligands (TOPO) {{have been investigated}} {{in comparison with the}} analogous nanocrystals containing electrochemically active oligoaniline ligands. The TOPO-capped nanocrystals have been studied in a wide size range (from 3 to 6. 5 nm) with the goal to amplify the influence of the quantum confinement effect on the electrochemical response. The determined HOMO and LUMO levels have been found in good agreement with the ones obtained from photoluminescence studies and those predicted theoretically. Ligand exchange with aniline tetramer significantly influences the voltammetric peaks associated with the HOMO oxidation and the LUMO reduction of the quantum dots, which are shifted to higher and lower potentials, respectively. These shifts are interpreted in terms of the positive ligand charging which precedes the oxidation of the nanocrystals and the insulating nature of the ligand {{in the case of the}} nanocrystal reduction. The ligand-nanocrystal interactions have also been studied by UV-Vis-NIR and Raman spectroelectrochemistry in comparison with a specially prepared model compound which, apart from the anchoring function is identical to the grafted oligoaniline ligand. Both spectroelectrochemical techniques clearly indicate the same nature of the oxidation/reduction pathway for both the model compound and the grafted ligand. The influence of the grafting is manifested by a shift in the onset of the ligand oxidation as compared to the case of the "free" model compound. Since both components (ligands and nanocrystals) mutually influence their electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical properties, the newly developed system can be considered as a true molecular hybrid. Such hybrids are of interest because the potential zone of the ligand electroactivity is well separated from that of the nanocrystals and, as a result, the organic part can be electrochemically switched between the semiconducting and the conducting states with no change in the oxidation state of the nanocrystal. The newly developed system offers therefore the possibility of an <b>electrical</b> <b>addressing</b> of individual nanocrystals via the conducting ligand...|$|E

40|$|The full {{potential}} of nanotechnology can be unleashed only {{when one is}} able not only to synthesize a rich variety of nanoscale building blocks but also assemble them into various patterns at the supramolecular and supracluster levels. In particular, the application of nanoparticle and nanowire materials often requires their assembly {{in the form of}} thin films, preferably on conductive surfaces for <b>electrical</b> <b>addressing,</b> control, and detection. Although a dazzling array of nanostructures has been fabricated by bottom-up approaches, one of the contemporary challenges is to assemble these nanostructures so that they introduce and realize functionalities. An alluring avenue is to simultaneously accomplish both the nanostructure synthesis and assembly on a useful substrate in a parallel fashion, affording the advantages of simplicity, low cost, and high throughput. In this Account, we review our recent work on growing inorganic nanowires (for example, metal sulfides, metal oxides, and so forth) directly from and on metal substrates in arrays without using templates and catalysts. This method of engineering nanowire arrays on metal substrates integrates the nanowire synthesis and assembly into a parallel process, both in time and in space, by exploiting in situ chemistry on the metal substrates. Both gas-phase and solution-phase approaches have been developed to synthesize the aligned nanowires; here, full advantage is taken of interfacial kinetics of restricted diffusion and surface-specific reactions, often accompanied by new interfacial growth mechanisms. The setting of nanowire arrays on metal substrates has allowed exploration of their application potentials in areas such as field electron emission and chemical sensing. The approaches described here are general, and we predict that they will be extended to more inorganic materials, such as metal halides. Moreover, as more control is achieved with synthetic methods, inorganic nanowire arrays should provide unusual magnetic, optical, and electronic properties for nanostructural engineers willing to confront the attendant challenges. Accordingly, applications for which there is a current impetus for progress, such as solar cells or lithium ion secondary batteries, might well be addressed with this methodology...|$|E
40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the fabrication of one-dimensional nanostructures based on DNA templates. The aim hereby {{is the development of}} novel, conducting, DNA-based materials, which may at the end allow the programmable assembly of DNA-based electronic nanostructures, like nanoswitches and conductive nanowires. DNA is a suitable template because of its one-dimensional structure and its extraordinary self recognition properties. Due to the sequence of base pairs and the possibility to direct this sequence by modern methods for the synthesis of DNA the template is furthermore to a certain degree programmable. The multitude of binding sites at the DNA bases and the charged backbone as well as the possibility to incorporate artificial bases instead of the natural ones allows a modification of DNA with metal ions and nanoparticles. For the synthesis of the one-dimensional nanostructures presented in this work native DNA strands as well as artificially synthesized DNA duplexes were utilized. Two main strategies for the metallization are described: the immobilization of preformed nanoparticles to DNA templates and the continuous metallization of DNA strands for the generation of continuous metal nanowires. One approach investigated in this work is the immobilization of amine terminated Fe/Pt nanoparticles to neighbouring GC base pairs in native plasmid DNA via the DNA binding complex cisplatin. In this context, a variety of water soluble Fe/Pt particles stabilized by different amines were synthesized via a ligand exchange reaction and studied by means of transmission electron microscopy. The coupling of ethylenediamine stabilized Fe/Pt particles to native plasmid DNA with cisplatin could be shown by AFM. This method yielded partly decorated strands, due to a low selectivity for binding sites, and was therefore not investigated in detail. However, the versatile surface functionalization of the water soluble Fe/Pt nanoparticles in combination with the extraordinary magnetic properties of the material opens the opportunity of diverse biomedical applications. Spatially defined DNA-nanoparticle-assemblies could be obtained by immobilization of azide terminated Au nanoparticles to artificial DNA duplexes. Those DNA duplexes which were synthesized by PCR incorporate artificial alkyne labeled thymine and cytosine derivatives instead of the native bases within their sequence. The immobilization of azide terminated nanoparticles to the alkyne functionalized template could be accomplished via the Cu(I) -catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition, the so called ‘click’ reaction. The azide functionalized Au particles were obtained by direct synthesis as well as by ligand exchange reactions in one- and two-phase systems. The resulting nanoparticles with sizes between 1 - 4 nm were characterized by means of AFM, TEM, UV/Vis, and ATR. After the reaction with the alkyne labeled templates, one-dimensional nanoparticle arrays could be obtained as proven in detailed TEM and AFM studies. It could be observed that the array consists of uniform nanoparticles with regular particle distance presumably caused by the space requirement of the ligand shell around the particles. A second main goal in this work was the generation of continuously metallized nanowires with tunable diameters. Therefore again alkyne labeled DNA duplexes were utilized which were reacted with a sugar azide in a further step to generate reductive groups {{on the surface of the}} strands. Incubation with Tollens solution yielded Ag nucleation sites on the DNA, which could be covered with a Ag or Au layer in a further step. The resulting structures could be characterized by means of AFM and SEM. In case of the bimetallic Ag/Au wires diameters of 10 nm and smaller could be obtained. In time dependent metallization experiments the metallization time could be identified as a size-defining variable. Furthermore, the Ag nanowires, which were synthesized according to a similar method, were characterized by means of SEM and EDX. The latter showed a diameter between 50 nm and 100 nm and could be used for <b>electrical</b> <b>addressing</b> with a nanomanipulator unit incorporated into the chamber of the SEM. A long-term objective emerging from this thesis will be the combination of both methods, the site specific continuous metallization of DNA and the spatially defined immobilization of preformed metal clusters on the DNA strand. The feasibility of both methods has been demonstrated here. In combination they give prospect to functional DNA-based devices generated by self-assembly processes in solution...|$|E
40|$|SiNW FETs and CNT FETs {{have been}} studied as {{candidates}} for integrable biosensors. Both types show sensing capability, CNT FETs even for uncharged molecules. The “top–down” process developed for SiNW FET fabrication gives much freedom in device designing and is fully compatible with CMOS production schemes. Due {{to the fact that}} the SiNW fabrication reported here uses the same structuring techniques as in CMOS processing, it is very reliable. The fabrication of CNT FETs is based on CVD. By this process CNT FETs with interesting device parameters can be reached. Since CVD needs high temperatures it is not compatible with CMOS techniques. CVD growth leads to a mixture of CNT types which results in a low device yield. The contact regions between the nanoscale CNTs and fabricated metal contacts are very critical. Hysteresis, device break down due to metal etching or chemical disruption and instability in liquid environment have been attributed to the Pd–CNT contacts. It was shown that the degradation of CNT FETs can be recovered. With this both device types show good long term stability. The concept of combining the electrolyte–gate with the back–gate, presented in the example of pH sensing on SiNW FETs, enables stable performance in liquid environment. Based on our current experience we propose the following improvements regarding future device design: SiNW FETs: • Improvement in sensitivity could be reached by removing the top oxide locally and by reducing the nanowire width. An optimal width needs to be found for high sensitivity and low device to device fluctuations. • A higher doping, up to 1018 cm− 3, would enhance the contact properties and lower the threshold voltages. But as the screening length LD is reduced, the nanowire width has to be reduced as well. • Control of the nanowire surface by a thin oxide layer or covalent functionalization could help for stabilization and would allow specific sensing. • Differential measurements between a sensing and a reference SiNW FET would allow stable performance. CNT FETs: Especially with respect to stability and to reproducibility further improvements need to be done. Some possible solutions are: • Humidity free fabrication and annealing before the deposition of the metal contact. • Titanium as contact material. Annealing leads to titanium carbide contacts [32] which are less transparent, but expected to be more stable. • Contact passivation has to be very robust and innert. Therefore we suggest to cover the contact region with silicon oxide or silicon nitride. • Increase of the hydrophobicity of the SiO 2 surface by a monolayer of alkane ended molecules. Due to the improved stability in fabrication and performance reported here and with the further improvements suggested above, we can think about possible applications of SiNW FETs and CNT FETs and give an outlook on possible future developments. The high intrinsic sensitivity of CNT FETs is of interest in real time monitoring of minute amount of molecules — or ultimately single molecules — without labelling. In contrast to conventional sensing techniques, such as fluorescence microscopy, the devices can easily be integrated on a micro chip which is of special interest for in vivo experiments where access with optical instruments is limited. Need in current basic research of biophysics can be met this way. However the limited reliability in fabrication and performance of CNT FETs hinders their integration into complex, highly integrated devices or their implementation in industrial products. In contrast to this SiNWs are well suited in this respect. The fabrication is entirely CMOS compatible and very flexible in design. Devices proved to be robust under the conditions of all performed experiments. Depending on the application of interest the sensitivity can be chosen by adjusting the NW size. The SiNW FETs introduced here can be used as transducers for various sensor types. Implementing on–chip micro pH sensors would be the most direct way to an industrial product. For this purpose, two different surface types are needed: a pH–sensitive surface for the working FET and a pH–insensitive surface for a reference FET. Going beyond this into the field of biosensing, specific receptors have to be immobilized. For multiplex sensing, each SiNW in an array has to be functionalized individually. This can be realized by techniques such as microcontact printing [149], dip-pen- [150] or conventional lithography [151] combined with UV assisted Si-H chemistry [152] or by <b>electrical</b> <b>addressing</b> of individual NWs, for example by electrochemical [153] or local heat assisted [154] Si chemistry. In a next step the SiNW sensor array has to be combined with an electronic read out system — preferably implemented on–chip. Further on such a multiplex sensor device can be integrated in a micro fluidic system. Complex micro fluidic systems including actuators such as pumps and valves, separation and mixing chambers, and liquid multiplexing, all on one chip have been reported [155, 156, 157, 158]. Integrated sensors that can be coupled to actuators via integrated electronic control elements can enhance the functionality of such devices. As an example we think of a ring mixer where the liquid is cycled repeatedly. An integrated sensors could not only monitor the mixing, but the product of chemical reactions in situ. Combining the sensors, logic on–chip electronics and micro fluidic actuators would lead to complex, even programmable Lab-On-Chip systems. Such devices could be used for fast and massively parallel analyzing tools — maybe a key technology for systems biology and an opening to the “post microarray area”...|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} duality and asymptotic {{stability of}} the positive linear <b>electrical</b> circuits are <b>addressed.</b> The specific duality of positive linear electrical circuits composed of resistances, inductances, capacitances and source voltages is established. 1) The linear electrical circuits are positive {{if and only if}} the common branches between meshes with resistances and inductances and meshes with resistances and capacitances contain only source voltages; 2) In linear electrical circuits the interchanges of the inductances by the capacitances and the capacitances by inductances do not change the asymptotic {{stability of the}} electrical circuits.

The research was directed toward solving the problems of material fatigue, selective heat <b>addressing,</b> <b>electrical</b> charging of the film surface and charge patterning by light. A number of solutions to these problems were found but the main conclusion {{to be drawn from}} the work is that deformable media which employ heat in the recording process are not satisfactory for use in a high-speed random-access read/write holographic memory. They are, however, a viable approach in applications where either high speed or random-access is not required...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Targeted at {{improving}} the overall integrity of functionalised composite structure, an embedded sensor network technique was developed using circuited piezoelectric wafers. The technical difficulties due to sensor embedment, such as <b>electrical</b> insulation, were <b>addressed.</b> With Hilbert transform-based signal processing and a correlation-based identification algorithm, Lamb wave signals, excited and {{captured by the}} integrated sensor network, were evaluated for damage assessment. Effectiveness of the sensor network and proposed identification algorithm was demonstrated by identifying delamination in orthotropic woven fabric CF/EP composite laminates. Excellent identification capacity of the built-in sensor network indicates its considerable application potential in providing high-fidelity data acquisition/condition monitoring for composite structures...|$|R
