40|$|Pursuant to its duties under Health and Safety Code Section 41125, the Commission of Housing and Community Development hereby refers the California Statewide Housing Plan, 1977 (which {{includes}} the Farmworker <b>Housing</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Plan,</b> reproduced {{in a separate}} volume) to the Legislature for review, revision, and adoption. The Plan was prepared by the Department of Housing and Community Development, {{in conjunction with the}} Business and Transportation Agency. The Department and the Commission of Housing and Community Development jointly held extensive public hearings on drafts of the Plan. Private industry, local government, and other state agencies provided substantial and valuable input into the preparation of the Plan. The Commission commends the staff of the Department of Housing and Community Development for its diligent efforts to involve as many individuals and organizations as possible in the preparation of the Plan. These efforts not only made the Plan a better document, but also tended to assure that the Plan should have the widest possible public support and acceptance. The Legislature has directed our Commission to send to it our comments on the Plan. Because the Plan has many aspects to it, and because each Commissioner 2 ̆ 7 s view of our state 2 ̆ 7 s housing problems differs somewhat, some Commissioners wish to comment separately · on the Plan. Those comments are attached...|$|E
50|$|The {{other main}} {{feature of the}} Act was the {{creation}} of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG). While not directly tied to public housing, CDBGs were lump sums of money, the amount of which was determined by a formula focusing on population, given {{to state and local governments}} for housing and community development work. The sum could be used as determined by the community, though the legislation also required the development of <b>Housing</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Plans</b> (HAP) which required local communities to survey and catalog their available housing stock as well as determine the populations most in need of assistance. These were submitted as part of the CDBG application.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this paper}} examines the effect of <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> programs on aspects of labour market behaviour and outcomes in Australia. The relationship between <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> and labour market behaviour is a key concern of policy makers. In fact, a guiding principle of the current agreement between {{the federal and state}} governments concerning the provision of <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> programs is the need to ensure that 2 ̆ 7 <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> supports access to employment and promotes social and economic participation 2 ̆ 7 (Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement 2003, Schedule 1).

40|$|Australian {{state and}} federal governments spend a large amount of money on {{providing}} <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> to Australian households. This <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> takes a variety of forms. It includes the provision of public housing, subsidies for low-income renters in the private sector and various forms of assistance for homeownership. An improved housing outcome for the recipient provides an explicit rationale for much of this recipient based assistance. In addition to directly influencing <b>housing</b> outcomes, <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> programs also have significant non-shelter effects. The keys areas in which <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> programs may influence non-shelter outcomes include physical and mental health, education status, labour market outcomes, crime, community participation and social cohesion, income andwealth distribution and poverty outcomes, and locational advantage.

40|$|This article uses {{data from}} {{randomized}} evaluations in Indiana and Delaware to address three questions: (1) Are welfare recipients who receive federal <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> less employable than recipients who do not? (2) How does {{the impact of}} welfare reform compare for families with and without <b>housing</b> <b>assistance?</b> (3) Does welfare reform increase or decrease {{the use of such}} <b>assistance?</b> Although public <b>housing</b> residents may be more disadvantaged than welfare recipients who do not get <b>housing</b> <b>assistance,</b> voucher users and Section 8 project-based recipients were not. Welfare reform had similar impacts on the earnings and welfare benefits of families that received <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> and those that did not.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the recent evolution, {{at a time}} of turmoil within global financial markets, of Australia&# 039;s housing system and considers the effectiveness of <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> responses formulated to assist low-income Australians. Following the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), housing was recast in the public and political consciousness and received substantial policy attention. In this era of rapidly declining housing affordability as well as threats to the supply of housing finance, the Australian Government renewed its approach to <b>housing</b> <b>assistance.</b> The paper examines <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> in Australia and assesses individual outcomes in terms of a &# 039;wellbeing dividend&# 039;. It draws upon on a survey of 1700 low-income households to examine individual outcomes for health and wellbeing across three of Australia&# 039;s major forms of <b>housing</b> <b>assistance.</b> The research clearly shows that while <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> makes a positive contribution to wellbeing, not all forms of assistance are equal...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} employment outcomes of Australian labour market programme participants {{vary according to}} whether they receive <b>housing</b> <b>assistance.</b> This issue attracted attention when a series of US studies showed that clients of welfare-to-work programmes {{are more likely to}} achieve positive employment outcomes if <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> is also received. This paper tracks the employment outcomes of labour market programme participants utilising six waves of data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) database.

40|$|The rate of {{employment}} participation {{has been consistently}} lower among <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> recipients than non-housing assistance recipients {{over the past two}} decades. In the period 1982 - 2000 employment outcomes among public housing tenants has deteriorated, despite an improving employment outlook for the general working age population during most of the 1990 s. In this paper, we report the findings from the first stage of a collaborative research venture that examines the impacts of <b>housing</b> <b>assistance,</b> that is public housing concessional rents and Commonwealth Rent Assistance, on economic participation outcomes. Research directions that will be followed in the remainder of the collaborative research venture are also outlined in this paper. The first stage of the collaborative research venture comprises four main components. Firstly, <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> recipients are profiled against appropriate benchmark groups in the Australian population. Secondly, the contribution of <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> programmes to poverty and unemployment traps are measured. Thirdly, data sources that will enable researchers to conduct analysis into the causal links between <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> and economic participation are examined. Fourthly, an inventory of housing policy initiatives that encourage economic participation is provided. We find that working age adults eligible for <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> generally confront deeper poverty and unemployment traps than other income support recipients. Among public housing tenants concessional rents make a significant contribution to the depth of both poverty and unemployment traps. We also find evidence of multiple barriers to economic participation faced by <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> recipients that include lack of access to computers and the Internet, inferior educationa...|$|R

40|$|In Australia, an {{increasing}} number of households face problems of access to suitable housing in the private market. In response, the Federal and State Governments share responsibility for providing <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> to these, mainly low-income, households. A broad range of policy instruments are used to provide and maintain <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> across all <b>housing</b> tenures, for example, assisting entry into homeownership, providing affordability assistance in the private rental market, and the provision of socially owned and managed housing options. Underlying each of these interventions is the premise that secure, affordable, and appropriate housing provides not only shelter but also a number of nonshelter benefits to individuals and their households. Although the nonshelter outcomes of housing are well acknowledged in Australia, the understanding of the nonshelter outcomes of <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> is less clear. This paper explores nonshelter outcomes of three of the major forms of <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> provided by Australian governments—low-income mortgage <b>assistance,</b> social <b>housing,</b> and private rent assistance. It is based upon analysis of a survey of 1, 353 low-income recipients of <b>housing</b> <b>assistance,</b> and specifically measures the formulation of health and well-being, financial stress, and housing satisfaction outcomes across these three assistance types. We find clear evidence that health, finance, and housing satisfaction outcomes are associated with quite different factors for individuals in these three major <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> types...|$|R

40|$|Policymakers {{have started}} {{examining}} the long-term impacts of <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> on families.

In this article we use a longitudinal data set of households receiving <b>housing</b> <b>assistance</b> and compare their trajectories on three outcomes—income, earnings, and employment—across types of housing programs and household characteristics. Using descriptive and multivariate analyses, we find notable differences in these three outcomes across different housing programs and populations.
