5000|$|Paragraph 5 of SFAS No. 157 (now {{known as}} ASC 820 in the updated FASB Codification) <b>defines</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> as “the price {{that would be}} {{received}} to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.” Of note, this Statement requires consideration of the exit price paid (if liability) or received (if asset) in a hypothetical transaction in an orderly market (i.e., not a forced liquidation or sold under duress).|$|E
50|$|Also new in FAS 157 is {{the idea}} of nonperformance risk. FAS 157 {{requires}} that in valuing a liability, an entity should consider the nonperformance risk. If FAS 157 simply required that fair value be recorded as an exit price, then nonperformance risk would be extinguished upon exit. However, FAS 157 <b>defines</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> as the price at which you would transfer a liability. In other words, the nonperformance that must be valued should incorporate the correct discount rate for an ongoing contract. An example would be to apply higher discount rate to the future cash flows to account for the credit risk above the stated interest rate. The Basis for Conclusions section has an extensive explanation of what was intended by the original statement with regards to nonperformance risk (paragraphs C40-C49).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the reliability of}} <b>Fair</b> <b>Value</b> Measurements (FVM). It argues that lack of agreement on FVM objectives and <b>defining</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> in terms of prices that would have obtained in a hypothetical market transaction between willing buyers and sellers are potential sources of reliability problems. FVM requires estimates and judgments {{on the part of}} management especially when no active market exists for the item in question. These estimates and judgments are different from those made under the transactions-based accounting system because normally there is no historical entity experience to discipline <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> estimates. This paper argues that under the current state of market development, expanding the use of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> may not be warranted. Furthermore, given that even a small change in inputs (e. g., cash flows estimates, discount rate, etc.) may {{have a significant impact on}} <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> estimates, it argues that firms should provide adequate disclosures so as to make users aware of the non-absoluteness of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> estimates. This paper also argues that reliability of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> estimates for the same class of items may not be the same in all countries because of inter-country differences in the level of market developments and hence, a more cautious approach towards mandating <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> for all countries is warranted...|$|R

40|$|The {{doctrine}} of shareholder oppression protects a close corporation minority investor from the improper exercise of majority control.

Further, when is <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> to be measured? The questions are critical ones that affect the lives of countless close corporation investors and that generate {{an enormous amount of}} present-day litigation. This Article builds a case for <b>defining</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> as enterprise value in the shareholder oppression context. The Article argues, in other words, that the buyout remedy should provide an oppressed minority investor with his pro rata share of the company 2 ̆ 7 s overall value, with no reductions (or 2 ̆ 2 discounts 2 ̆ 2) for the lack of control or liquidity associated with the minority 2 ̆ 7 s shares.

5000|$|Subsequently, FAS 157 was subsumed into FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820 (Fair Value Measurement), {{which now}} <b>defines</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> as [...] "The price {{that would be}} {{received}} to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date." [...] This is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "exit value". In the futures market, fair value is the equilibrium price for a futures contract. This is equal to the spot price after taking into account compounded interest (and dividends lost because the investor owns the futures contract rather than the physical stocks) over a certain period of time.

With Auction Rate Securities no longer being liquid, public companies began to write down their ARS holdings starting {{in the first quarter}} of 2008. Through May 31, 2008, 402 publicly traded companies had reported Auction Rate Securities on their books. Of those 402, 185 had taken some level of impairment. However, there had been no ascertainable trend in the amount of writedowns taken. Firms have reported discounts ranging from 0-73% of par value. IncrediMail, Ltd. proved the most extreme example of this as it booked an impairment of 98% off face value for its ARS holdings, while Berkshire Hathaway took no impairment on its more than $3.5 billion of these securities. Some of the higher-profile firms taking writedowns include Bristol-Myers Squibb, 3M and US Airways. Citigroup took a $1.5 billion loss on its inventory of auction rate securities.|$|E

With debt markets locked up tight and equity bashed to very low levels, everyone is understandably trying to duck any blame. One place where a lot of blame is being placed is on the “mark to market ” style of accounting currently required by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).

40|$|Motivation et objectifs <b>Defining</b> the <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> of {{derivatives}} is not {{a simple}} task. In insurance, a <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> of a contingent claim is calculated by taking expectations of the claim payoff with addition of the claim variance or standard deviation to account for risk. In some other cases, when utility functions are used, the <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> is <b>defined</b> to be the certainty equivalent of the claim. The certainty equivalent is the amount which, when received by certainty, is regarded as good as taking the risk. In financial markets, the <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> of an option is the expectation of the discounted payoff, where the expectation is taken under a different probability measure. When the underlying risk is assumed to be log-normally distributed, Black-Scholes type formulae for options can be obtained. It should be stressed that, in capital markets, many ad-hoc methods were used before the Black and Scholes methodology gained the consensus among different market participants. And even though it is widely used, {{it is well known that}} its assumptions are not realistic and it cannot be applied to pricing all types of options.

40|$|Using {{the dual}} Black-Scholes partial {{differential}} equation, Dupire derived an explicit formula, involving {{the ratio of}} partial derivatives of the evolving <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> of a European call option (ECO), for recovering information about its variable volatility. Because the prices, {{as a function of}} maturity and strike, are only available as discrete noisy observations, the evaluation of Dupire’s formula reduces to being an ill-posed numerical differentiation problem, complicated by the need to take the ratio of derivatives. In order to illustrate the nature of ill-posedness, a simple finite difference scheme is first used to approximate the partial derivatives. A new method is then proposed which reformulates the determination of the volatility, from the partial differential equation <b>defining</b> the <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> of the ECO, as a parameter identification activity. By using the weak formulation of this equation, the problem is localized to a subregion on which the volatility surface can be approximated by a constant or a constant multiplied by some known shape function which models the local shape of the volatility function. The essential regularization is achieved through the localization, the choice of the analytic weight function, and the application of integration-by-parts to the weak formulation to transfer the differentiation of the discrete data to the differentiation of the analytic weight function...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirement}} of applying International Financial Reporting Standards (IAS/IFRSs) for all EU listed companies starting from 2005, is causing some adapting issues since the International Accounting System {{is quite different}} from that of Continental countries, in particular Italy.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} utilizes empirical {{methods to}} shed light on the current debate over whether to adopt <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting for loans held for long term. Proponents of <b>fair</b> <b>valuing</b> loans argue that reporting loans at their <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> enhances the overall transparency of financial reporting. In contrast, opponents are against applying <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting to loans because <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> cannot be measured reliably in the case of loans held for long term. Therefore, the key question here is whether loan <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> are sufficiently reliable to provide more relevant and transparent information compared to traditional measurements of loans. To explore this, I compare <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> disclosures of loans under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 (SFAS 107), Disclosures about <b>Fair</b> <b>Value</b> of Financial Instruments, with traditional measurements of loans reported on balance sheets. More specifically, this study asks two research questions; (i) whether loan <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> provide more relevant information about future loan losses compared to traditional measurements of loans and (ii) whether banks intentionally manage their <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> estimates of loans when they are financially distressed. SFAS 107 mandates the disclosure of <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> for financial instruments with the objective of providing investors with more relevant information about firms' future cash flows. However, the results show that <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurements of loans explained variation in future loan losses, which capture cash flows from loans, less than traditional cost-based measurements of loans. In addition, I find evidence suggesting that financially distressed banks overstated the <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> of their loan portfolios and that <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> of loans in the aggregate lagged considerably behind the market values of loans during the recent credit crisis. Overall, my results suggest that <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> disclosures in bank loan portfolios contain relatively less information about future cash flows because they are measured unreliably and they suffer from a similar lack of timeliness as reported carrying values...|$|R

The {{object of the}} research {{is to find out}} whether the dominant role of historical cost accounting evidenced by prior studies applies to companies domiciled in Central and Eastern Europe. What is more, I also examine how <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting affects asset values and explore what explains the choice to use <b>fair</b> <b>value.</b> All the companies included in the research report under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The total sample comprehends companies that come from five different countries including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovenia. To clarify the applied accounting methods for PPE and investment property I read each company's accounting policies for these asset groups in its annual report. <b>Fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting's effect on asset values is studied by comparing different financial ratios between historical cost companies and <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> companies. The choice to apply <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting to PPE and investment property is examined by applying a logistic regression analysis. In line with previous evidence, historical cost accounting is the dominant accounting method. However, I find more support for <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting for PPE than previous studies. On the other hand, <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting for investment property is slightly less popular than results from earlier studies would suggest. The results indicate that <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting has a significant impact on asset <b>values.</b> <b>Fair</b> <b>value</b> companies have clearly higher book-to-market ratios and lower return on assets (ROA). When examining the choice to apply <b>fair</b> <b>value,</b> I find that companies operating in the real estate industry are more likely to apply <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> to investment property. As for PPE, there are two factors that explain the choice to apply <b>fair</b> <b>value.</b> First, companies that measure investment property at <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> are more likely to apply <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> to PPE as well. Second, PPE-heavy firms are more likely to measure PPE at <b>fair</b> <b>value...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} how investors perceive <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> {{gains and losses}} arising from {{the adoption of the}} standard Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159 The <b>Fair</b> <b>Value</b> Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (hereafter FAS 159). We find that there is a positive correspondence between a firm’s stock returns and FAS 159 gains and losses attributable to <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> changes in assets. However, we do not observe a similar relation for gains and losses arising from <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> changes in liabilities. The results provide support that there are different valuation implications from <b>fair</b> <b>valuing</b> liabilities as opposed to <b>fair</b> <b>valuing</b> assets. Specifically, investors may perceive the <b>value</b> implications of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> changes from liabilities as less economically viable than those arising from changes in the <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> of assets. Further analyses provide support that FAS 159 gains and losses enable investors to better assess the underlying economic risk of the firm...|$|R
40|$|Many {{have argued}} that {{measuring}} financial instruments at <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> might not reflect firms’ financial condition. Prior study finds that managers manipulate the “disclosure” of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurement (Song et al. 2010). In this study, we attempt to provide evidence regarding manager’s incentive to manipulate the disclosure of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurements by examining whether the disclosure of less relevant <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurement {{is related to the}} odds of earnings management. We find that firms with more Level 3 assets and liabilities (i. e., less <b>value</b> relevant <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurement) are more likely to recognize positive unrealized gains to meet or beat analyst forecast target. In addition, we find that only firms with weak corporate governance disclose more Level 3 <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> liabilities and recognize unrealized gains into reported earnings to meet or beat analyst forecast target. This evidence suggests that managers manipulate the disclosure of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurement in order to manage reported earnings via the adoption of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> option. ...|$|R
