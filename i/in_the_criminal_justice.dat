25|$|Moore v.

The case resulted from prosecution of twelve men for the death of a white man associated with the Elaine Race Riot in Phillips County, Arkansas. A white railroad security employee died on September 30, 1919 after shots were exchanged outside a church where a black tenant farmers union was meeting. With rumors of black insurrection, Governor Charles Hillman Brough led a deployment of federal troops into the rural county, arresting hundreds of blacks. Other blacks were allowed to be in public only with military passes. In the week after the shooting, roving bands of whites and federal troops killed upwards of 200 blacks.|$|E
25|$|From the 1980s the UK {{government}} passed several {{acts that}} had a provision concerning sectarian violence. These included the Public Order Act 1986, which introduced offences relating to the incitement of racial hatred, and the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which introduced offences of pursuing a racially aggravated course of conduct that amounts to harassment of a person. The 1998 Act also required courts {{to take into account}} where offences are racially motivated, when determining sentence. In the twenty-first century the Scottish Parliament legislated against sectarianism. This included provision for religiously aggravated offences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Justice</b> (Scotland) Act 2003. The Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 strengthened statutory aggravations for racial and religiously motivated crimes. The Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012 criminalised behaviour which is threatening, hateful, or otherwise offensive at a regulated football match including offensive singing or chanting. It also criminalised the communication of threats of serious violence and threats intended to incite religious hatred.|$|E
25|$|There was a hard-fought 16-month {{legal battle}} in the House of Lords, then the highest court of the United Kingdom. Pinochet claimed {{immunity}} from prosecution as a former head of state under the State Immunity Act 1978. This was rejected, as the Lords decreed that some international crimes, such as torture, could not be protected by former head-of-state immunity. This judgement was set aside in a second, unprecedented case, {{on the basis that}} one of the judges involved was potentially biased due to his ties to Amnesty International, a human rights activist organization that had campaigned against Pinochet for decades and intervened in the case. A third case in March 1999 confirmed the original verdict, but the Lords held in this case that Pinochet could only be prosecuted for crimes committed after 1988, the year during which the United Kingdom implemented legislation for the United Nations Convention Against Torture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Criminal</b> <b>Justice</b> Act 1988. This invalidated most, but not all, of the charges against him; but the outcome was that extradition could proceed.|$|E

25|$|When Cardenas {{learned of}} his wife's predicament, he {{recommended}} that she retain Charles Garry, a criminal attorney who had {{gained a reputation}} in Soledad State Penitentiary as the ardent defender of George Jackson, Huey P. Newton, and Bobby Seale. At the same time, news of the case reached the San Francisco Bay Area, where the women's rights and Chicano movements were at their apex. García began speaking to women's groups in the area, and the Inez Garcia Defense Committee raised money for the defense and publicized the case, hoping to put gender inequalities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> system, rather than Garcia herself, on trial. Through her contact with feminist groups, Garcia transformed from the timid, submissive victim who was too ashamed to even admit {{what had happened to}} her into an outspoken critic of patriarchy, even when she saw it in her own judge, who she accused of prejudice and sexism. During the trial, Garry had argued that García had acted with diminished capacity. He based this argument on expert psychological testimony that rape causes mental trauma and García's own history of mental instability. The defense disappointed feminists who preferred to see García as a symbol of strength and resistance to male domination. It also failed to win the sympathy of the jury. García was convicted of second-degree murder, sentenced, and spent two years in the California Institution for Women before her appeal was heard.|$|E

He then examines how Plath blamed her father for her suffering, and identifies him in her poem [...] "Daddy" [...] with Nazism and makes allusions to the holocaust. Dalrymple writes that [...] "Plath felt it right to allude {{to one of the}} worst and most deliberate inflictions of mass-suffering in the whole of human history, merely on the basis that her father, who died when she was young, was German…the metaphorical use of the holocaust measures not the scale of her suffering, but of her self-pity". He asserts that before Plath, self-pity [...] "was regarded as a vice, even a disgusting one, that precluded sympathy", and that [...] "the appropriation of the suffering of others to boost the scale and significance of one's own suffering is now a commonplace." [...] He then analyses a number of figures, including Binjamin Wilkomirski and Margaret Seltzer, who he alleges [...] "make bogus claims to victim status" [...] and whose stories reveal perfectly [...] "the dialectic between sentimentality and brutality". Dalrymple ends the chapter by analysing victimhood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> system and concludes, [...] "For the sentimentalist, of course, {{there is no such thing}} as a criminal, only an environment that has let him down".|$|E
