5|$|As of 1 January 2014, Esbjerg has a {{population}} of 71,618, making it the fifth-largest city in Denmark, and the largest in west Jutland. Until the harbour was developed in the 1860s, the area was sparsely inhabited with just a few farms. Thereafter, it grew rapidly: by 1880, there were some 1,500 inhabitants, rising to some 13,000 by 1901 when it was already larger than neighbouring Varde and Ribe. By the end of the 1950s, with almost 60,000 inhabitants, it had become Denmark's fifth-largest city. By 1970, Esbjerg had seen a fivefold increase <b>in</b> <b>population</b> since 1901, reaching some 70,000.

40|$|Objectives. This report {{analyzes}} {{cigarette smoking}} over 10 years <b>in</b> <b>populations</b> <b>in</b> the World Health Organization (WHO) MONICA Project (to monitor trends and determinants of cardiovascular disease). Methods. Over 300 000 randomly selected subjects aged 25 to 64 years participated in surveys conducted <b>in</b> geographically defined <b>populations.</b> Results. For men, smoking prevalence decreased {{by more than}} 5 % in 16 of the 36 study <b>populations,</b> remained static <b>in</b> most others, but increased in Beijing. Where prevalence decreased, this was largely due to higher proportions of never smokers in the younger age groups rather than to smokers quitting. Among women, smoking prevalence {{increased by more than}} 5 % <b>in</b> 6 <b>populations</b> and decreased by more than 5 % <b>in</b> 9 <b>populations.</b> For women, smoking tended to increase <b>in</b> <b>populations</b> with low prevalence and decrease <b>in</b> <b>populations</b> with higher prevalence; for men, the reverse pattern was observed. Conclusions. These data illustrate the evolution of the smoking epidemic <b>in</b> <b>populations</b> and provide the basis for targeted public health interventions to support the WHO priority for tobacco control...|$|R

40|$|DOI: 10. 1890 / 02 - 0557 © Ecological Society of AmericaCoupled trophic {{interactions}} with specialist predators or resources {{are thought to}} be primarily responsible for generating delayed density dependence. Previous theoretical studies suggest that autocorrelation in exogenous factors could generate apparent negative delayed density dependence <b>in</b> <b>populations</b> regulated only by direct density dependence. Using both linear and nonlinear models, we show that autocorrelated exogenous factors can generate the spurious appearance of not only negative, but also positive, delayed density dependence <b>in</b> <b>populations</b> regulated only by direct density dependence. Evidence for negative delayed density dependence is found mainly <b>in</b> <b>populations</b> exhibiting monotonic deterministic stability, whereas evidence for positive delayed density dependence is found mainly <b>in</b> <b>populations</b> exhibiting damped or persistent two-point cycles, or more complex deterministic dynamics. We argue that fluctuating resources (e. g., mast seeding) in bottom-up controlled communities could qualify as autocorrelated exogenous factors and cause apparent delayed density dependence <b>in</b> the <b>population</b> of their consumers...|$|R

5|$|A {{population}} ecology concept is r/K selection theory, {{one of the}} first predictive models in ecology used to explain life-history evolution. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to population density. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase <b>in</b> <b>population</b> size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available resources for rapid population growth. These early phases of population growth experience density-independent forces of natural selection, which is called r-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called K-selection.|$|E
5|$|A workhouse {{was built}} in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law which stated that each Poor Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief to the {{increasing}} numbers of destitute poor. In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2,715, this increased to 4,677 by 1841. There {{were a couple of}} reasons for this large growth <b>in</b> <b>population.</b> Firstly the opportunities provided by the booming linen industry led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan in the hope of gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the construction of new buildings such as Brownlow House.|$|E
