50|$|Very {{soon after}} Pellow's Barbary capture and {{conversion}} to Islam, {{he was on}} a <b>forward</b> <b>track</b> towards his elite slave stature. Pellow was educated to speak Arabic, as well as how to perform Moroccan social customs. From roughly the age of 12, Thomas Pellow was given the responsibility of managing 80 slave boys. Pellow's excelled in his new position and eventually was transferred into the Palace to work as a personal attendant for Mulai Ismail's son, Mulai Zidan. Pellow's close proximity to the monarch's family exposed him to the many forms of capricious violence the Mulai family often employed. During his time there he witnessed the Zidan murder his favourite black slave for disturbing two pigeons that Zidan was observing. We can interpret Pellow's role as Zidan's personal attendant as preparatory grooming technique that tested Pellow's ability to care for the monarch.|$|E
30|$|The system {{sometimes}} makes a mistracking, {{especially when}} the motion is fast, {{because of the large}} motion vectors.

Because our final aim is mesh tracking throughout a video sequence, neither backward <b>tracking</b> nor <b>forward</b> <b>tracking</b> is well suited. The backward tracking provides good results when simply applied to two successive images, but it is damaged by the initial mesh which can not generally be considered as known on the last frame.

50|$|A cyclist {{executing}} a basic track stand {{holds the}} bicycle's cranks in a horizontal position, {{with his or}} her dominant foot <b>forward.</b> <b>Track</b> stands executed on bicycles with a freewheel usually employ a small uphill section of ground. The uphill needs to be sufficient to allow the rider to create backward motion by relaxing pressure on the pedals, thus allowing the bike to roll backwards. Once the track stand is mastered, even a very tiny uphill section is sufficient: e.g. the camber of the road, a raised road marking, and so on. Where no such uphill exists, or even if the gradient is downhill, a track stand can be achieved on a freewheeling bicycle by using a brake to initiate a backwards movement. If a fixed-gear bicycle is being used, an uphill slope is not needed since the rider is able to simply back pedal to move backwards. In both cases forward motion is accomplished by pedalling forwards. The handlebars are held at approximately a 45 degree angle, converting the bike's forward and back motion into side-to-side motion beneath the rider's body. This allows the rider to keep the bike directly below their center of gravity.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a new smoothing algorithm called fixed-lag smoothing data association algorithm based on IPDA (FLIPDA-S) for tracking maneuvering targets in clutter using a constant-velocity model. At the first scan of each smoothing interval, the smoothing data association probabilities, the smoothing target trajectory estimation, and the smoothed target existence probability are obtained by using smoothing innovations. In the fusion, each fIPDA track prediction (including both the updated <b>forward</b> <b>tracks</b> based on smoothing data association probabilities {{and the new}} initialized <b>forward</b> <b>tracks)</b> fuses with the validated bIPDA track predictions through data association to obtain the information fusion state predictions, which is used for calculating the smoothing innovations. The simulation study shows a significant improvement in the target state estimation accuracy and FTD {{as compared to the}} IPDA. The FTD benefit of FLIPDA-S over sIPDA and IPDA is demonstrated by the effectiveness of applying smoothing data association algorithm to the tracking of maneuvering targets in clutter.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{energy output}} of solar-thermal systems using flat plate {{collectors}} {{can be improved}} by tracking. Tracking is well known as a path for {{increasing the amount of}} solar radiation received by the collector; additionally the paper proposes a new concept that considers the inverse tracking as a viable option for protecting the collectors against overheating. An analysis of the thermal energy output and conversion efficiency is done considering <b>forward</b> <b>tracking</b> in three different days with different radiation profile (cloudy, sunny and mixed days), followed by an analysis of the inverse tracking concept. The in-field data show that there is a limiting angle below which inverse tracking is not effective and this value is estimated at 40 ° as compared with the optimal orientation. A logical scheme is proposed based on four different programs for <b>forward</b> <b>tracking,</b> inverse tracking, maximum inverse tracking or fixing the collector; this decisional scheme covers a broad range of functional situations having as central concept the production of thermal energy only when needed, for satisfying the demand, decreasing the energy consumption for forced circulation and supporting the systems reliability and safety...|$|R

30|$|In {{smoothing}} algorithms, the <b>forward</b> <b>track</b> prediction and the backward track prediction {{are based}} on measurements collected in a fixed-lag smoothing interval [k,N]. In the smoothing interval, the fusion of <b>forward</b> <b>track</b> prediction and backward track prediction is performed at scan k. Therefore, in an environment with densely populated clutter, low detection probabilities, and uncertain target motion, the forward predicted state and the backward predicted state may lie far away such that their contributions to establish the fused predicted state may be insignificant, which results in bad fusion performance. Due to this, fusion of forward prediction and backward prediction becomes a challenging issue. Thus, smoothing algorithm may fail to detect the true target trajectories. For such difficult environments, we propose a new smoothing algorithm called fixed-lag smoothing data association based on IPDA (FLIPDA-S). The proposed algorithm considers a constant-velocity model {{to deal with the}} problems of tracking a maneuvering target in a cluttered environment. A constant-velocity model is a dynamic model of a tracking filter that describes the target motion using a 4 -dimensional state vector composed of 2 -dimensional position and 2 -dimensional velocity. The proposed work uses an arbitrary size of the smoothing interval [k,N], where the first scan of each smoothing interval faces fixed-lag smoothing, such that the fixed-lag of the proposed algorithm is N−k. Unlike sIPDA [19], the proposed FLIPDA-S algorithm does not use the RTS algorithm for smoothing.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} FLIPDA-S algorithm employs {{two independent}} IPDA filters, {{where the first}} IPDA filter runs in the forward (fIPDA) direction and the other runs in the backward (bIPDA) direction. The FLIPDA-S algorithm utilizes bIPDA multi-track state predictions. The backward multi-track state predictions at each scan in the smoothing interval are obtained recursively by utilizing the sensor measurements starting {{from the end of}} the smoothing interval to the beginning of the smoothing interval. The fIPDA tracks are initialized and maintained by using the sensor measurements at each scan. At each scan in the fixed-lag interval, the <b>forward</b> <b>track</b> state prediction of FLIPDA-S is used to produce smoothing innovations associating with the multiple tracks generated from bIPDA. In this fusion, each track in the forward path treats the backward path tracks as the measurements for data association. The smoothing data association probabilities, smoothed target trajectory state, and smoothed target existence probability are obtained by applying the smoothing innovations to the sensor measurements received at scan k in the fixed-lag smoothing interval [k,N]. FLIPDA-S uses smoothing data association probabilities to update and propagate the existing forward tracks to the next smoothing interval. In the next fixed-lag interval, the FLIPDA-S uses each updated <b>forward</b> <b>track</b> and new forward tracks (initialized by fIPDA) to fuse with the backward path multiple tracks to smooth the target trajectory state and the probability of target existence. This procedure continues in each subsequent interval, which significantly improves both the target trajectory state estimation accuracy and the FTD. The simulation study of Section 5 shows improved FTD performance of FLIPDA-S as compared with sIPDA and IPDA for maneuvering target tracking in a cluttered environment.|$|E
