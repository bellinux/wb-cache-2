500|$|The American press, {{eager for}} {{positive}} stories about U.S. {{involvement in the}} war effort, quickly turned [...] "Scarsdale Jack" [...] {{into one of the}} nation's most written-about fighter pilots during {{the first few months of}} the war. Broadcaster Lowell Thomas mentioned him by name on several occasions, as did Life Magazine, Time Magazine, the Associated Press, the United Press, and the Chicago Daily News and New York Times. [...] The Walt Disney organisation created an official Flying Tigers insignia – a winged Bengal tiger with extended claws flying through a large blue V for victory – which Newkirk and other AVG members sewed on their <b>flight</b> <b>jackets</b> and painted on their aircraft. Zip Comics and Wings Comics each devoted full-color spreads to Newkirk and his aerial exploits.|$|E

Scooterboy fashion includes <b>flight</b> <b>jackets,</b> mechanic's jackets, and motorcycle jackets. [...] "Skinheads brought in things such as Doc Martens and pilot jackets ... Punks brought in clothes such as the leather jacket and tighter clothing Beneath the jacket was often a band T-shirt or a tartan shirt taken from rockabillies" [...] Psychos often cut the arms off of their leather jackets, converting them into vests, and decorate the jackets with horror imagery or band logos.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} name, Confederate Air Force, {{started as}} a simple tongue in cheek joke, poking fun at the organization's ragtag beginnings. As the collection of warbirds at Central Valley Airport in Mercedes, Texas started to grow, someone painted {{the name on the}} side of the original North American P-51 Mustang Red Nose. The name stuck, and it grew to the point where the airport was renamed Rebel Field, all members were called [...] "colonels" [...] (a tradition which still remains), and it led to the creation of a fictitious leader named Colonel Jethro E. Culpepper. There was even a humorous CAF twist put to the old AVG Flying Tigers World War II [...] "blood chit" [...] that read, [...] "This foreign person has come to China to help in the war effort. Soldiers and civilians, one and all, should rescue, protect, and provide him medical care." [...] The CAF version seen on the backs of flight suits and <b>flight</b> <b>jackets</b> stated, [...] "This is a CAF aviator. If found lost or unconscious, please hide him from Yankees, revive with mint julep and assist him in returning to friendly territory. CONFEDERATE AIR FORCE".|$|E

50|$|The MA-1 bomber jacket (also {{known as}} the MA-1 <b>flight</b> <b>jacket)</b> is an American {{military}} jacket which was first developed in the mid 1950s.

5000|$|More technically, {{the jacket}} may be {{considered}} the U.S. Military <b>flight</b> <b>jacket</b> developed in 1947 and used in the Korean War, since the term [...] "G-1" [...] was not used as a label for this fur-collared military-issued jacket until after World War II. However, the term [...] "G-1" [...] {{has come to be}} used for this style of naval leather <b>flight</b> <b>jacket.</b> Prior to the end of World War II, and starting in 1940 when it was officially named by the U.S. Navy, the jacket had the military spec number of M-422.|$|R

50|$|The {{decline of}} DOD {{contracts}} {{and expansion of}} foreign production threatened to end Alpha Industries.

5000|$|Flight {{clothing}} varied widely by {{theater of}} operation {{and type of}} mission. Innovative aviation flight suits, boots, leather helmets, goggles, and gloves were issued as early as 1928 to the Air Corps, {{and at least one}} style, the Type A-3 flight suit, continued in service until 1944. However, A-2 <b>flight</b> <b>jackets,</b> made standard issue on 9 May 1931, became one of the best known symbols of the AAF. Made of seal brown horsehide leather (later supplemented by goatskin) with a beige spun silk lining (cotton after 1939), the jackets featured an officer's stand-up collar, shoulder straps, knit waistbands and cuffs, a zipper closing, and unit insignia. Heavy, sheepskin-lined B-3 and B-6 <b>flight</b> <b>jackets,</b> A-3 winter flying trousers, and B-2 [...] "gunner's" [...] caps, all in seal brown shearling, proved insufficient for the extreme cold temperatures of high altitude missions in unpressurized aircraft, and were supplemented by a variety of one-piece electrically heated flying suits manufactured by General Electric. In addition to men's flight clothing, flight nurses wore specially manufactured women's lightweight and intermediate weight <b>flight</b> <b>jackets</b> and pants. Flight clothing such as the A-2 jacket was not authorized to be worn off the camp or post unless required for flight duty. The same sage green fatigue uniforms of herringbone cotton twill, and wind-resistant poplin field jackets used by Army ground troops, were also worn by AAF troops depending on duty assignment.|$|E

He immediately bought a couple of the jackets, thinking the pockets would serve him well as a referee. He changed to black knickers, kept the white shirt, and wore the new black <b>flight</b> <b>jacket,</b> creating the black uniform with the apparent white [...] "trim." ...|$|R
