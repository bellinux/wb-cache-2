5|$|The shrine at Bury St Edmunds {{soon became}} one of the most famous and wealthy pilgrimage {{locations}} in England. In 1010, Edmund's remains were translated to London to protect them from the Vikings, where they were kept for three years before being returned to Bury. For centuries the shrine was visited by various kings of England, many of whom gave generously to the abbey: Sweyn's son, King Canute, converted to Christianity and rebuilt the abbey at Bury St Edmunds. In 1020, he made a pilgrimage and offered his own crown upon the shrine as atonement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> his forefathers.|$|E
5|$|Three major {{theological}} controversies {{occurred during}} Manuel's reign. In 1156–1157 {{the question was}} raised whether Christ had offered himself as a sacrifice <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> {{the world to the}} Father and to the Holy Spirit only, or also to the Logos (i.e., to himself). In the end a synod held at Constantinople in 1157 adopted a compromise formula, that the Word made flesh offered a double sacrifice to the Holy Trinity, despite the dissidence of Patriarch of Antioch-elect Soterichus Panteugenus.|$|E
5|$|Once Pope struck, Cibber {{became an}} easy target for other satirists. He was {{attacked}} as the epitome of morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> his autobiography. In the Apology, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was not merely the fact of the autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of The Champion. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces that he came down to posterity.|$|E

25|$|Jesus' crucifixion is not {{considered}} an atonement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> humanity. The crucifixion is taught to be an outcome of the fears of religious leaders of the day, who regarded his teachings {{as a threat to}} their positions of authority.|$|E
25|$|Jesus is the Messiah, {{the second}} person of the Trinity, was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, died <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> all humanity, rose again, and is co-equal with God. Jesus will return to earth in the near future.|$|E
25|$|Allegorically, the Inferno {{represents}} the Christian soul seeing sin {{for what it}} really is, and the three beasts represent three types of sin: the self-indulgent, the violent, and the malicious. These three types of sin also provide the three main divisions of Dante's Hell: Upper Hell, outside the city of Dis, for the four sins of indulgence (lust, gluttony, avarice, anger); Circle 7 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> violence; and Circles 8 and 9 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> malice (fraud and treachery). Added to these are two unlike categories that are specifically spiritual: Limbo, in Circle 1, contains the virtuous pagans who were not sinful but were ignorant of Christ, and Circle 6 contains the heretics who contradicted the doctrine and confused the spirit of Christ. The circles number 9, {{with the addition of}} Satan completing the structure of 9 + 1 = 10.|$|E
50|$|For Christianity, {{salvation}} is {{only possible}} through Jesus Christ. Christians believe that Jesus' {{death on the}} cross was the once-for-all sacrifice that atoned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> <b>of</b> humanity.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{government}} as well as school authorities forbid such games, they are widely practiced. Historians tell of a bishop in 1867 who threatened excommunication <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> <b>of</b> playing Carnival games.|$|R
50|$|According to the Talmud, {{the wearing}} of the tunic {{and the rest of}} the priestly {{garments}} atoned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> <b>of</b> bloodshed on <b>the</b> part of the Children of Israel (B.Zevachim 88b).|$|R
25|$|Some have {{contended that}} the {{doctrine}} of particular redemption implies that Christ's sacrifice was insufficient to atone <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> the whole world, but Calvinists have universally rejected this notion, instead holding {{that the value of}} the atonement is infinite but that God intentionally withholds its efficacious availability only to the elect.|$|E
25|$|Adventists {{teach that}} the scapegoat, or Azazel, {{is a symbol}} for Satan. They believe that Satan will finally have to bear the {{responsibility}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> the believers of all ages, {{and that this was}} foreshadowed on the Day of Atonement when the high priest confessed the sins of Israel over the head of the scapegoat (Leviticus 16:21).|$|E
25|$|The central iconic {{imagery of}} the two traditions {{underscore}} the difference in their belief structure, when the peaceful death of Gautama Buddha at an old age is contrasted with the harsh image of the crucifixion of Jesus as a willing sacrifice for the atonement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> humanity. Buddhist scholars such as Masao Abe see the centrality of crucifixion in Christianity as an irreconcilable {{gap between the two}} belief systems.|$|E
50|$|Jewish philosophic preachers such as Jacob Anatoli and Isaac Arama {{viewed the}} groups and events in Genesis 6:1-4 as an allegory, {{primarily}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> <b>of</b> lust that declined man's higher nature.|$|R
2500|$|Rashi {{explained}} that in [...] God required {{the people to}} bring a young bull as an offering, because [...] required such an offering to make atonement when the community had committed idolatry (and they were atoning <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Golden Calf).|$|R
5|$|Another {{monument}} {{marks the}} spot where the fire stopped: the Golden Boy of Pye Corner in Smithfield. According to the inscription, it was evidence of God's wrath on the City <b>of</b> London <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> <b>of</b> gluttony that <b>the</b> fire started at Pudding Lane and stopped at Pye Corner.|$|R
25|$|The Men who had {{remained}} faithful {{were given the}} island of Númenor, {{in the middle of}} the Great Sea, and there they established a great Kingdom; and the White Tree of Númenor was planted in the King's city of Armenelos; and it was said that while that tree stood in the King's courtyard, the reign of Númenor would yet last. The Elves were granted pardon <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> Fëanor, and were allowed to return home to the Undying Lands.|$|E
25|$|Any {{member of}} the LDS Church, male or female, who is at least 12 years old and holds a current temple {{recommend}} may act as a proxy in this ordinance. Men must also hold the Aaronic priesthood prior to entering the temple. Men act as proxy for deceased men, and women as proxy for deceased women. The concept of a spiritual proxy is compared by some in the LDS Church {{to the belief that}} Jesus acted as proxy for every human when he atoned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> the world.|$|E
25|$|Blunt {{is staying}} in Belvile's house. Florinda enters, sees Blunt and asks him for help. Blunt then {{attempts}} to rape her {{based on his}} new contempt for women ("be revenged on one whore <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> another"). Frederick enters, also convinced that Florinda is a prostitute, and joins Blunt. Florinda gives them a diamond ring and asks them to consult Belvile. Frederick fears {{that she might be}} a lady of some worth and asks Blunt to wait. Blunt is still sceptical but agrees. Frederick locks Florinda in a room.|$|E
5|$|Leontius was {{bishop of}} Antioch from 348 to 357. He is {{quoted in the}} Chronicon Paschale, or Paschal Chronicle, a {{universal}} chronicle of history based on the paschal cycle, as an authority on the martyrdom of Babylas. The quotation describes Philip seeking penitence from Babylas <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> <b>of</b> murdering his predecessor.|$|R
25|$|Traditionally, Yom Kippur is {{considered}} the date on which Moses received {{the second set of}} Ten Commandments. It occurred following the completion of the second 40 days of instructions from God. At this same time, the Israelites were granted atonement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Golden Calf; hence, its designation as the Day of Atonement.|$|R
50|$|Later, Arjuna {{built the}} Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple during his conquest for Ashvamedha in South India. Legend {{has it that}} Arjuna built this temple to expiate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> <b>of</b> having killed Karna against the Dharma of killing an unarmed enemy. The temple is {{dedicated}} to Parthasarathy (Lord Krishna's role as Arjuna's charioteer in the war).|$|R
25|$|God {{resolves}} {{to destroy}} the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> their people. Abraham protests and gets God to agree not {{to destroy the}} cities if 10 righteous men can be found. Angels save Abraham's nephew Lot and his family, but his wife looks back on the destruction against their command and is turned into a pillar of salt. Lot's daughters, concerned that they are fugitives who will never find husbands, get him drunk to become pregnant by him, and give birth to the ancestors of the Moabites and Ammonites.|$|E
25|$|The {{manner of}} Gordon's death is uncertain, {{but it was}} romanticized in a popular {{painting}} by George William Joy – General Gordon's Last Stand (1893, currently in the Leeds City Art Gallery), {{and again in the}} film Khartoum (1966) with Charlton Heston as Gordon. The most popular account of Gordon's death was that he put on his ceremonial gold-braided blue uniform of the Governor-General together with the Pasha's red fez and that he went out unarmed except with his rattan cane to be cut down by the Ansar. This account was very popular with the British public as it contained much Christian imagery with Gordon as a Christ-like figure dying passively <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> all humanity.|$|E
25|$|Scholars such as Paul Numrich {{have stated}} that despite surface level non-scholarly analogies, Buddhism and Christianity have {{inherent}} and irreconcilable differences at the deepest levels. The central iconic imagery of the two traditions underscore {{the difference in the}} perspectives on Buddha and Jesus, when the peaceful death of Gautama Buddha at an old age is contrasted with the harsh image of the crucifixion of Jesus as a willing sacrifice for the atonement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sins</b> <b>of</b> humanity. Buddhists scholars such as Masao Abe and D. T. Suzuki see the centrality of crucifixion in Christianity as an irreconcilable gap between the lives of Buddha and Jesus. Despite this, some Hindus see Jesus as a shaktavesha avatar, or an empowered incarnation.|$|E
25|$|Some devotions {{have the}} form of Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sufferings and insults that Jesus endured during His Passion or <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> <b>of</b> blasphemy, e.g. <b>the</b> Golden Arrow Prayer. Devotions {{involving}} the Sacred Heart of Jesus {{first appeared in the}} eleventh and twelfth centuries, but most current devotions are attributed to Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque (1647–1690).|$|R
25|$|The Jerusalem Talmud and Midrash Leviticus Rabbah (x.) {{give the}} {{following}} interpretation: The coat symbolized atonement for murder or <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> <b>of</b> wearing mixed garments, and the undergarment typified atonement <b>for</b> unchastity. <b>The</b> miter denoted atonement <b>for</b> pride, and <b>the</b> belt <b>for</b> theft or trickery. The breastplate represented atonement for any perversion of the Law, <b>the</b> ephod <b>for</b> idolatry, and <b>the</b> robe <b>for</b> slander.|$|R
50|$|It is {{this advice}} that led Dante Alighieri to place Guido in Hell. In Canto XXVII of the Inferno, Guido recounts how he reluctantly gave advice to Boniface, only after Boniface {{had agreed to}} absolve him <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> <b>of</b> his {{fraudulent}} counsel. As Guido recounts his story, after his death St. Francis arrived to claim his soul <b>for</b> <b>the</b> saved, but a black Cherub asserted Hell's superior claim.|$|R
