5000|$|Robert Malkin is a Professor of the Practice of Biomedical Engineering at Duke University. He is {{best known}} for his work {{concerning}} medical equipment in the <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> for which he was named one of Today's Engineering Heroes by IEEE in 2015. Dr. Malkin founded Engineering World Health, a non-profit that delivers technical expertise and medical equipment to the <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> He also founded The Global Public Service Academies an organization that places high school students in <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> clinics and hospitals. Working at Duke University, Dr. Malkin helped launch several efforts for making and distributing medical devices for the <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> including a bili light company called PhotoGenesis Medical and a colposcope project at Family Health Ministries. Dr. Malkin has published papers and books on Medical Instrumentation in the <b>Developing</b> <b>World</b> (2006) and has published and consulted in the field of cardiac defibrillation.|$|R

30|$|The {{traditional}} nuance {{of development}} as ‘modernisation’ explains why in many polities in the <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> MTE {{is only for}} {{the first few years of}} schooling before transition to education in other languages, usually western languages. Within this framework, MTE is conceptualised as being a simplistic but necessary precursor of education in western languages. This orientation to development which informs many an education system in the <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> accounts for the crises of MTE in <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> polities. Human development on its part accounts for the renewed interest in MTE in many polities in the <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> MTE is conceptualised as an integral part of enlarging people’s choices within and outside the education system.|$|R

40|$|Responding {{to rapid}} and steep {{increases}} {{in the cost of}} scientific journals, a growing number of scholars and librarians have advocated “open access” (OA) to the scientific literature. OA publishing models are having {{a significant impact on the}} dissemination of scientific information. Despite the success of these initiatives, their impact on researchers in the <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> is uncertain. This article analyses major OA approaches adopted in the industrialized world (so-called Green OA, Gold OA, and OA mandates, as well as non-OA information philanthropy) as they relate to the consumption and production of research in the <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> The article concludes that while the consumption of scientific literature by <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> researchers is likely to be significantly enhanced through such programs, promoting the production of research in the <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> requires additional measures. These could include the introduction of better South-focused journal indexing systems that identify high-quality journals published in the <b>developing</b> <b>world,</b> coupled with the adjustment of academic norms to reward publication in such journals. Financial models must also be developed to decrease the reliance by institutions in the <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> on information philanthropy and to level the playing field between OA journals in industrialized and developing countries...|$|R
30|$|MTE {{discourse}} is critical and {{is bound to}} remain so {{for a long time}} especially in the <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> That this is the case is hardly surprising for as Mwaniki ([2010]) pointedly submits, more than a century after the onset of the colonial project in much of the <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> that has unequivocally sought to replicate the ethnolinguistic homogenisation project of Western and Central Europe, it can safely be submitted that this project has failed to produce the ‘desired’ results of ethnolinguistic homogenisation. Despite polities in the <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> pursuing unilingual and/or bilingual policies which are largely inimical to MTE, multilingualism has not vanished {{in this part of the}} world. It may just be time to acknowledge failure of the ethnolinguistic homogenisation project of the last 100  years; and the viability and resilience of multilingualism the <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> Such an acknowledgement will signal a new dawn for MTE in the <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> A resurgent MTE discourse will greatly benefit from language management.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{test the}} {{capitalist}} and democratic peace arguments within the <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> Notwithstanding the theoretical arguments and empirical evidence which indicate two different dynamics of interstate conflict in the developing and the <b>developed</b> <b>worlds,</b> the proponents of both “democratic peace” and “capitalist peace” arguments did {{not take into account}} the distinction between developing and developed countries and tested their hypotheses within samples that included “all dyads” in different time periods. This study aims to fill this gap by testing capitalist and democratic peace arguments within the <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> It tests the capitalist and democratic peace arguments through statistical analysis (logistic regression) of the militarized interstate disputes in the <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> between 1951 and 2000. The results support the “capitalist peace” argument and suggest that, within the <b>developing</b> <b>world,</b> economic development leads to interstate peace, whereas democracy does not. The findings are robust to different measures of conflict, democracy and economic development...|$|R

5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution it was {{realized}} that the military and economic might of nations were dependent on both the body size and strength of their soldiers and workers. Increasing the average body mass index from what is now considered underweight to what is now the normal range {{played a significant role in}} the development of industrialized societies. Height and weight thus both increased through the 19thcentury in the <b>developed</b> <b>world.</b> During the 20th century, as populations reached their genetic potential for height, weight began increasing much more than height, resulting in obesity. In the 1950s increasing wealth in the <b>developed</b> <b>world</b> decreased child mortality, but as body weight increased heart and kidney disease became more common.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{examines}} {{organizational and}} political issues {{associated with the use}} of geographic information systems (GIS) and land information systems (LB) in the <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> The paper suggests that “appropriate technology ” for the <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> does not have to be old-fashioned or unsophisticated; it just has to be cheap, effective, reliable, and easy to use. As a result, the question of whether GIS technology is appropriate for regional planning in the <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> is dependent on the availability of all four components of the GIS technology “package”: suitable equipment, appropriate information, proper organization, and available expertise. This paper considers each of these components as they relate to the use of GIS for regional planning in the <b>developing</b> <b>world...</b>|$|R
