25|$|Bascom {{started making}} portraits in 1801 by tracing the shadow {{cast of the}} sitter by lamp- or candlelight on <b>drawing</b> <b>paper</b> placed on a wall in a dark room. At that time, cutting {{profiles}} was a popular parlor game and an inexpensive form of art. She didn't seem to make many portraits {{in the first decade}} or so of the 19th century; she recorded making portraits just seven times between 1801 and 1808, and {{there was no mention of}} profiles again until 1818, when she made them of the recently deceased son and wife of A. Gould. In 1819 she began making profiles in the evenings. The subject's features and other details were drawn with a pencil.|$|E

60|$|I {{reflected}} for {{a minute}} or two. The portrait was only wanted in chalk, and would not take long; besides, I might finish it in the evening, if my other engagements pressed hard upon me in the daytime. Why not leave my luggage at the picture-dealer's, put off looking for lodgings till night, and secure the new commission boldly by going back at once with the landlord to the hotel? I decided on following this course almost as soon as the idea occurred to me--put my chalks in my pocket, and a sheet of <b>drawing</b> <b>paper</b> in the first of my portfolios that came to hand--and so presented myself before Mr. Faulkner, ready to take his likeness, literally at five minutes' notice.|$|E

This haversack he got ready, supplying it with all that he thought would be required for the excursion. He put in it his drinking cup,--the one which he had bought in Scotland,--a little spy glass, which he used for viewing the scenery, a book that his mother was reading, a little portfolio containing some <b>drawing</b> <b>paper</b> and a pencil, a guide book and map, and, lastly, a paper of small cakes and sugar plums, to give to any children that he might chance to meet on the way.|$|E
60|$|The Studio was a {{large and}} lofty room, lighted by a skylight, and running {{along the side of}} the house {{throughout}} its whole depth. Its walls were covered with plain brown paper, and its floor was only carpeted in the middle. The most prominent pieces of furniture were two large easels placed at either extremity of the room; each supporting a picture of considerable size, covered over for the present with a pair of sheets which looked woefully in want of washing. There was a painting-stand with quantities of shallow little drawers, some too full to open, others, again, too full to shut; there was a movable platform to put sitters on, covered with red cloth much disguised in dust; there was a small square table of new deal, and a large round table of dilapidated rosewood, both laden with sketch-books, portfolios, dog's-eared sheets of <b>drawing</b> <b>paper,</b> tin pots, scattered brushes, palette-knives, rags variously defiled by paint and oil, pencils, chalks, port-crayons--the whole smelling powerfully at all points of turpentine.|$|E

Not content with this she hunted out a huge sheet of <b>drawing</b> <b>paper</b> and drew upon it an original pen-and-ink design after her own heart. A dudish cat--Miss Allen was fond of the No. 16 cat if she could be said to be fond of anything--was portrayed seated on a rocker arrayed in smoking jacket and cap with a cigar waved airily aloft in one paw while the other held out a placard bearing the legend [...] "Merry Christmas." [...] A second cat in full street costume bowed politely, hat in paw, and waved a banner inscribed with [...] "Happy New Year," [...] while faintly suggested kittens gambolled around the border. The girls laughed until they cried over it and voted it to be the best thing Nellie had yet done in original work.|$|E
60|$|He {{found himself}} in a simply {{furnished}} man's sitting-room. An easel was standing close to the window. There were reams of <b>drawing</b> <b>paper</b> and several unfinished sketches leaning against the wall. There was a small oak table {{in the middle of the}} room; against the wall stood an exquisite chiffonier, on which were resting some cut-glass decanters and goblets. There was a Turkey carpet upon the floor which matched the curtains, but to his surprise there was not a single chair of any sort to be seen. The walls had been distempered and were hung with one or two engravings which, although he was no judge, he was quite sure were good. He wandered into the back room, where he found a stove, a tea-service upon a deal table, and several other cooking utensils, all spotlessly clean and of the most expensive description. The walls here were plainly whitewashed, and the floor was of hard stone. He then tried the door on the left, which led into the larger portion of the building--the shed in which the lifeboat had once been kept. Not only was the door locked, but he saw at once that the lock was modern, and the door itself was secured with heavy iron clamps. He returned to the sitting-room.|$|E
60|$|Looked out a {{quantity}} of things to go to Abbotsford; for we are flitting, if you please.[198] It is {{with a sense of}} pain that I leave behind a parcel of trumpery prints and little ornaments, once the pride of Lady S----'s heart, but which she sees consigned with indifference to the chance of an auction. Things that have had their day of importance with me I cannot forget, though the merest trifles. But I am glad that she, with bad health and enough to vex her, has not the same useless mode of associating recollections with this unpleasant business. The best part of it is the necessity of leaving behind, viz., setting rid of, a set of most wretched daubs of landscapes, in great gilded frames, of which I have often been heartily ashamed. The history of them was curious. An amateur artist (a lady) happened to fall into misfortunes, upon which her landscapes, the character of which had been buoyed up far beyond their proper level, sank even beneath it, and it was low enough. One most amiable and accomplished old lady continued to encourage her pencil, and to order picture after picture, which she sent in presents to her friends. I suppose I have eight or ten of them, which I could not avoid accepting. There will be plenty of laughing when they come to be sold. It would be a good joke enough to cause it to be circulated that they were performances of my own in early youth, and they would be looked on and bought up as curiosities. True it is that I took lessons of oil-painting in youth from a little Jew animalcule, a smouch called Burrell, a clever sensible creature though; but I could make no progress either in painting or drawing. Nature denied me correctness of eye and neatness of hand, yet I was very desirous to be a draughtsman at least, and laboured harder to attain that point than at any other in my recollection, to which I did not make some approaches. My oil-paintings were to Miss ------ above commemorated what hers are to Claude Lorraine. Yet Burrell was not useless to me altogether neither; he was a Prussian, and I got from him many a long story of the battles of Frederic, in whose armies his father had been a commissary, or perhaps a spy. I remember his picturesque account of seeing a party of the Black Hussars bringing in some forage carts which they had taken from a body of the Cossacks, whom he described as lying {{on the top of the}} carts of hay, mortally wounded, and, like the Dying Gladiator, eyeing their own blood as it ran down through the straw. I afterwards took lessons from Walker, whom we used to call Blue-beard. He was one of the most conceited persons in the world, but a good teacher--one of the ugliest countenances he had too--enough, as we say, to spean weans.[199] The man was always extremely precise in the quality of everything about him, his dress, accommodations, and everything else. He became insolvent, poor man, and for some reason or other I attended the meeting of those concerned in his affairs. Instead of ordinary accommodations for writing, each of the persons present was equipped with a large sheet of <b>drawing</b> <b>paper</b> and a swan's quill. It was mournfully ridiculous enough. Skirving[200] made an admirable likeness of Walker, not a single scar or mark of the smallpox which seamed his countenance, but the too accurate brother of the brush had faithfully laid it down in longitude and latitude. Poor Walker destroyed it (being in crayons) rather than let the caricature of his ugliness appear at the sale of his effects. I did learn myself to take some vile views from Nature. When Will Clerk and I lived very much together, I used sometimes to make them under his instruction. He to whom, as to all his family, art is a familiar attribute, wondered at me as a Newfoundland dog would at a greyhound which showed fear of the water.|$|E

30|$|To get paper-based SCs, a {{piece of}} Xerox paper (1.5 cm 2) was drawing by a 4 B pencil (86  % {{graphite}} and 14  % clay) until its sheet resistance reduced to about 95  Ω sq− 1 (~ 150 times of scratching). After that, a layer of thin graphite sheets was deposited on the paper. Then, the graphite–paper composite (the area is about 1.0  ×  1.0  cm) was immersed in a solution that contained 0.2  M NaClO 4 and 5  % (V:V) pyrrole monomer, and PPy was grown on the <b>drawn</b> <b>paper</b> via an electrochemical deposition process. Three-electrode configuration {{was used in this}} deposition process with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, platinum foil as the counter electrode and the <b>drawn</b> <b>paper</b> as the working electrode. A constant voltage of 0.8  V was applied during the process. Then the as-grown sample was washed with deionized water and dried at room temperature. In order to seek for the dependence of SC performance on PPy deposition time, the deposition time of PPy on the <b>drawn</b> <b>paper</b> was different. Finally, two pieces of 1.0  ×  1.5  cm functionalized paper were used as electrodes with the opposite area of 1.0  ×  1.0  cm. A gel composite H 3 PO 4 /PVA was used which acted as the separator and the electrolyte between the two electrodes. After the gel electrolyte dried completely, the quasi-solid-state SC was prepared.|$|R
