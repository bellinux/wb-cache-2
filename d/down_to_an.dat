He did not provide Mackendrick with another directoral role, but assigned him to second unit work. Another of Ealing's directors, Charles Crichton, added additional footage at Ealing Studios and re-edited the film; this version was the one released into cinemas.|$|E
5|$|After {{examining}} {{the practice of}} other British railways, Richard Maunsell, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, secured agreement for a 4-cylinder design, with an improved boiler and Belpaire firebox. The drive would be divided between the front coupled axle for the inside cylinders and the middle coupled axle for the outside cylinders giving better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow. The new design was an inevitable compromise between {{the need for additional}} power and to keep the weight <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> acceptable limit.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} central London Underground stations, Holborn was modernised {{in the early}} 1930s to replace the lifts with escalators. The station frontages on Kingsway and High Holborn were {{partially}} reconstructed to modernist designs by Charles Holden with the granite elements replaced with plain Portland stone façades perforated with glazed screens. The lifts were removed and a spacious new ticket hall was provided giving access to a bank of four escalators <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> intermediate concourse for the Central line platforms. A second bank of three escalators continues down to the Piccadilly line platforms.|$|E

Another participant, Daniel Pope, managed to track Russian <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> address in Richmond upon Thames and convinced him to be interviewed by Christmas TV and apologise on camera. As Russian had not actually taken money from his victims, he had not committed a crime, and a civil case was not pursued {{due to a lack of}} funds.|$|E
5|$|Malmö FF's average {{attendance}} at Malmö Stadion initially lay steady at around 15,000 per season from the mid-1960s {{to the early}} 1970s, before decreasing to around 10,000 spectators per season {{for the remainder of}} that decades. During the 1980s and the 1990s, attendances decreased even further <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> average of around 5,000 fans per season; the general interest in Swedish football was also very low at the time. Attendance took a sharp turn upwards during the 2001 season, Malmö FF's first season back in Allsvenskan after a season in Superettan. Average crowds then increased annually, and reached their peak during the 2004 season, when Malmö FF reached an all-time record average attendance of 20,061. Attendances afterwards decreased each year, and were down to a seasonal average of 11,182 by the time of Malmö FF's final season at the ground. Only 6,580 attended Malmö FF's last Allsvenskan match at the stadium, on 9 November 2008.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Battalion harassed the {{constantly}} moving German flying column during August and September 1917. Two Military Medals were won by RNR soldiers {{during this}} time: Sergeant Northcote rescued a wounded askari under German fire in late August, {{and a few}} days later Corporal Suga, himself lightly injured, dragged his wounded commanding officer Lieutenant Booth out of the open and into cover. The 2nd Battalion, comprising Major Jackson at the head of 585 askaris and 75 whites, left Salisbury on 16 September 1917, and joined the front on 16 October, when it arrived at Mbewa on the north-eastern shore of Lake Nyasa, intending to ultimately merge with 1RNR. After 1RNR spent two months garrisoning Wiedhaven and 2RNR underwent further training, the two forces joined on 28 January 1918 (becoming known as the 2nd Rhodesia Native Regiment), and immediately made their way south in pursuit of Lettow-Vorbeck's Germans, who were by now <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> effective strength of less than 2,000, and moving through Portuguese Mozambique.|$|E

5|$|After Becket's {{election}} as archbishop, Foliot was nominated to the Diocese of London, {{to which he}} was translated on 6March 1163. His nomination had been put forward by the king, who wrote to the pope stating that Foliot would be more accessible as an adviser and confessor if he was in London, rather than in Hereford on the Welsh Marches. Becket wrote to Foliot urging him to accept the translation. His transfer was confirmed by Pope Alexander III on 19 March 1163 and Foliot was enthroned at London on 28April 1163. Papal confirmation was required because the movement of bishops from one see to another was still frowned on at this time. The medieval chronicler Ralph de Diceto, who was a canon at London, states that the cathedral chapter at St Paul's Cathedral, London, the cathedral of the London diocese, approved of Foliot's selection. Becket was unable to attend Foliot's enthronement, and Foliot did not make a profession of obedience to the archbishop, arguing that he had already sworn an oath to Canterbury when he became Bishop of Hereford, and thus no further oath was required. The issue was sent to the papacy, but the pope refused to be pinned <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> answer. Foliot then attempted to make London independent of Canterbury by reviving Pope Gregory I's old plan for an archbishopric at London. Foliot proposed either to have London raised to an archdiocese along with Canterbury, or to have London replace Canterbury as the archiepiscopal seat for the southern province. Foliot did though support Becket in the latter's attempt to prevent the Archbishop of York having his archiepiscopal cross borne in procession before him when visiting the province of Canterbury.|$|E

25|$|To measure cosmogenic {{isotopes}} produced within solid earth materials, such as rock, {{samples are}} generally first put {{through a process}} of mechanical separation. The sample is crushed and desirable material, such as a particular mineral (quartz in the case of Be-10), is separated from non-desirable material by using a density separation in a heavy liquid medium such as lithium sodium tungstate (LST). The sample is then dissolved, a common isotope carrier added (Be-9 carrier in the case of Be-10), and the aqueous solution is purified <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> oxide or other pure solid.|$|E

25|$|By the 1950s, it {{appeared}} that absolute poverty was a minor problem although pockets did remain, for example among the elderly, but {{it was believed that}} increased welfare benefits would soon eradicate this lingering poverty.
