5|$|Henry Ward Beecher (June 24, 1813 – March 8, 1887) was an American Congregationalist clergyman, social reformer, and speaker, {{known for}} his support of the {{abolition}} of slavery, <b>his</b> <b>emphasis</b> on God's love, and his 1875 adultery trial.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Kalakaua was {{characterized}} by <b>his</b> <b>emphasis</b> on military pomp. On October 4, 1886, Iaukea was created adjutant general to the Forces of the Kingdom, succeeding upon the resignation of Charles T. Gulick. According to the military act of 1886, as adjutant general, he was the second-in-command after John Owen Dominis, who was appointed lieutenant general and commander-in-chief with the king as supreme commander and generalissimo.|$|E
5|$|The system expounded by Medhurst {{influenced}} later dictionary compilers {{with regard}} to tonal notation and initials, but both his complicated vowel system and <b>his</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the literary register of Southern Min were dropped by later writers. Following on from Medhurst's work, Samuel Wells Williams became the chief proponent of {{major changes in the}} orthography devised by Morrison and adapted by Medhurst. Through personal communication and letters and articles printed in The Chinese Repository a consensus was arrived at for the new version of POJ, although Williams' suggestions were largely not followed.|$|E

50|$|Joe Comartin was the MP for Windsor—St. Clair and the {{environment}} critic {{at the time of}} the election. His election in 2000 had been the first federal win for the NDP in Ontario in ten years, and he helped add a second Ontario seat with Brian Masse's win in the neighbouring Windsor West in 2002. <b>His</b> <b>emphases</b> included Mideast peace and support for UN resolutions on Palestine, and his campaign reached out prominently to the Muslim Canadian community.|$|R
5|$|While {{continuing}} {{work on the}} Cronica and {{detailing the}} enormous loss of life during the Black Death in 1348, Villani died of the same illness. His work on the Cronica was continued by his brother and nephew. Villani's work has received both praise and criticism from modern historians. The criticism is mostly aimed at <b>his</b> <b>emphasis</b> on supernatural guidance of events, his organizational style, and his glorification of the papacy and Florence.|$|E
5|$|After Symeon's death his {{writings}} were kept alive by {{small groups of}} followers, eventually {{becoming one of the}} central teachings of the hesychast movement. Many copies of his works were made in the following centuries, particularly around the 14th century, and among the Eastern Orthodox monasteries on Mt. Athos. His recognition has always been greater outside the official church, its calendar and liturgy. Historians credit this to his zealous personality, his criticism of the church hierarchy, <b>his</b> <b>emphasis</b> on direct experience of God, and some of his unorthodox teachings—including his belief that an unordained monk who had the direct experience of God was empowered to absolve others of their sins.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{there were}} few visible changes within the church. Tkach {{continued}} Armstrong's tradition of traveling abroad, although <b>his</b> <b>emphasis</b> was more on visiting church members and operations than on Armstrong's agenda of visiting world leaders to attempt to witness to them. The church entered a period of rapid growth {{during the early years}} of Tkach's administration. In fact, the membership peaked during his tenure at 126,800 members in 1988. The finances were stable, largely due to the church's teaching that members should tithe, giving a tenth of their gross income to the church. The church magazine, The Plain Truth, continued to serialize the final and most controversial book by Armstrong, Mystery of the Ages. Tkach also continued, at least in public, to promote the church's unique doctrines.|$|E

He had been a Member of Parliament for over 20 years. <b>His</b> <b>emphases</b> included trade, Medicare, taxes and the environment, and his parliamentary experience. An ordained minister in the United Church of Canada, Blaikie was a prominent heir to the Social Gospel, Christian left tradition deeply rooted in the NDP.|$|R

5|$|Although not {{as active}} in routine business, Johnson still took an {{interest}} in political events. For example, he spearheaded the efforts of the booksellers of London and Westminster to appeal a new copyright law in 1808. Moreover, although Johnson did not publish controversial political works after his imprisonment, he still undertook important publishing ventures. For example, he administered the publication of a forty-five volume work entitled The British Essayists, edited by Alexander Chalmers; the complete works of Samuel Johnson; and a ten-volume set of Shakespeare. Johnson published in more congers during the last decade of his life than at any other time. He also occasionally published important new authors, such as the political economist Thomas Malthus, whose Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) sparked a long debate between idealists and pragmatists. <b>His</b> <b>emphasis</b> on educational books continued or even increased as his interest in publishing contentious political works diminished. He also continued to support his friends, as with Godwin, who needed financial rescue after his play, Faulkener, cost him £800.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} interludes of The Loves of the Plants, {{the voice}} of the Poet, which would seem to be Darwin's voice as well, argues that poetry is meant to appeal to the senses, {{particularly}} vision. Darwin's primary tool for accomplishing this was personification. Darwin's personifications were often based on the classical allusions embedded with Linnaeus's own naming system. However, they were not meant to conjure up images of gods or heroes; rather, the anthropomorphized images of the plants depict more ordinary images. They also stimulate the readers' imaginations to assist them in learning the material and allow Darwin to argue that the plants he is discussing are animate, living things—just like humans. Darwin's use of personification suggests that plants are more akin to humans than the reader might at first assume; <b>his</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the continuities between mankind and plantkind contributes to the evolutionary theme that runs throughout the poem.|$|E
5|$|Petrus Christus {{placed his}} sitter in a naturalistic setting {{rather than a}} flat and featureless background. This {{approach}} was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in <b>his</b> <b>emphasis</b> on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces. In his 1462 , Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape, while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts. Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power. Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo's positioning of the Mona Lisa {{in front of a}} landscape view. Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff and Martin Schongauer among others.|$|E

5|$|To Whistler himself, {{however, the}} {{painting}} was not old-fashioned, but rather an expression of something new and innovative. By naming it Symphony in White, No. 3, Whistler highlighted <b>his</b> <b>emphasis</b> on composition, rather than subject matter. The use of a musical title was also {{an expression of the}} theory of corresponding arts, which was an idea developed by the French poet Charles Baudelaire. These tendencies became more and more dominant in Whistler's art over time. His two earlier paintings Symphony in White, No. 1 and Symphony in White, No. 2 had originally been titled The White Girl and The Little White Girl respectively, and later been renamed by the artist. Whistler had originally intended to call this work Two Little White Girls, but the development of his artistic philosophy made him change his mind, and from the time of its first exhibition it has been called by its musical title.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly, Roa Bastos' own {{experiences}} {{played a significant}} role in <b>his</b> <b>emphasis</b> on human suffering. As a young man he fought in the Chaco war between Bolivia and Paraguay, an event he portrayed in Hijo de hombre. Later he saw the devastation of WWII at first hand in Europe, the violent strife of 1947 in Paraguay, and the rise of the Argentinian military dictatorship in 1976. His collection of short stories published in 1953, El trueno ebtre las hojas, set the stage for Hijo de hombre and Yo, el Supremo with its dark portrayal of devastating political struggle and oppression. Two decades later, Yo, el Supremo was published, providing a prime example of Roa Bastos' idea of the engaged writer. It offered an unflattering, fictionalized account of the final thoughts and ramblings of Paraguay's first dictator, at a time when Paraguay was under the stranglehold of a regime that adopted many of the same policies of oppression and isolationism. Roa Bastos was not alone in using literature to engage in contemporary events during the Latin American Boom period. In the 1960s and 1970s, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and others adopted the same approach. Together, these writers created the Dictator novel genre.|$|E
5|$|What Yamamoto did {{not know}} was that the U.S. had broken the main Japanese naval code (dubbed JN-25 by the Americans), divulging many details of his plan to the enemy. <b>His</b> <b>emphasis</b> on {{dispersal}} also meant none of his formations were {{in a position to}} support each other. For instance, despite the fact that Nagumo's carriers were expected to carry out strikes against Midway and bear the brunt of American counterattacks, the only warships in his fleet larger than the screening force of twelve destroyers were two Kongō-class fast battleships, two heavy cruisers, and one light cruiser. By contrast, Yamamoto and Kondo had between them two light carriers, five battleships, four heavy cruisers, and two light cruisers, none of which would see action at Midway. The light carriers of the trailing forces, and Yamamoto's three battleships, were unable {{to keep pace with the}} carriers of the Kido Butai and so could not have sailed in company with them. The distance between Yamamoto and Kondo's forces and Nagumo's carriers had grave implications during the battle: the invaluable reconnaissance capability of the scout planes carried by the cruisers and carriers, as well as the additional antiaircraft capability of the cruisers and the other two battleships of the Kongō-class in the trailing forces, was denied to Nagumo.|$|E
