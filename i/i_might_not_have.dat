500|$|Brosnan has {{expressed}} contempt for his education by the Christian Brothers. However, in 2013 he commented, [...] "It always {{helps to have}} a bit of prayer in your back pocket. At the end of the day, you have to have something and for me that is God, Jesus, my Catholic upbringing, my faith... God has been good to me. My faith has been good to me in the moments of deepest suffering, doubt and fear. It is a constant, the language of prayer... <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> got my sums right from the Christian Brothers or might not have got the greatest learning of literature from them but I certainly got a strapping amount of faith." [...] Brosnan attends Mass, but adheres to other spiritual beliefs. In 2008 he said [...] "I also love the teachings of Buddhist philosophy. It's my own private faith. I don't preach it, but it's a faith that is a comfort to me when the night is long." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the tour, Black Sabbath {{returned}} to Los Angeles and again rented {{a house in}} Bel Air, where they spent nearly a year working on new material for the next album. The entire band were abusing both alcohol and other drugs, but Iommi says Osbourne [...] "was on a totally different level altogether". The band {{would come up with}} new song ideas but Osbourne showed little interest and would refuse to sing them. Pressure from the record label and frustrations with Osbourne's lack of input coming to a head, Iommi made the decision to fire Osbourne in 1979. Iommi believed the only options available were to fire Osbourne or break the band up completely. [...] "At that time, Ozzy had come to an end", Iommi said. [...] "We were all doing a lot of drugs, a lot of coke, a lot of everything, and Ozzy was getting drunk so much at the time. We were supposed to be rehearsing and nothing was happening. It was like 'Rehearse today? No, we'll do it tomorrow.' It really got so bad that we didn't do anything. It just fizzled out." [...] Drummer Ward, who was close with Osbourne, was chosen by Tony to break the news to the singer on 27 April 1979. [...] "I hope I was professional, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been, actually. When I'm drunk I am horrible, I am horrid", Ward said. [...] "Alcohol was definitely one of the most damaging things to Black Sabbath. We were destined to destroy each other. The band were toxic, very toxic." ...|$|E
2500|$|At age eight, Crosby {{wrote her}} first poem which {{described}} her condition. She later remarked: [...] "It seemed intended by the blessed providence of God that I should be blind all my life, and I {{thank him for}} the dispensation. If perfect earthly sight were offered me tomorrow I would not accept it. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> sung hymns to the praise of God if I had been distracted by the beautiful and interesting things about me." [...] She also once said, [...] "when I get to heaven, the first face that shall ever gladden my sight will be that of my Savior". According to biographer Annie Willis, [...] "had {{it not been for}} her affliction she might not have so good an education or have so great an influence, and certainly not so fine a memory".|$|E

But at the same time my uni is the centre of and is a massive part of the town itself. So even though I may not see it, I think there are links with the town. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> necessarily <b>have</b> that much of an insight into it.|$|R

6000|$|The Emperor had {{committed}} himself to my care. The Emperor was dead. Those {{were the two}} thoughts which clanged in my head, until I had no room for any other ones. He had come with me and he was dead. I had done what he had ordered when living. I had revenged him when dead. But what of all that? The world would look upon me as responsible. They might even look upon me as the assassin. What could I prove? What witnesses <b>had</b> <b>I?</b> <b>Might</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been the accomplice of these wretches? Yes, yes, I was eternally dishonoured--the lowest, most despicable creature in all France. This, then, {{was the end of}} my fine military ambitions--of the hopes of my mother. I laughed bitterly at the thought. And what was I to do now? Was I to go into Fontainebleau, to wake up the palace, and to inform them that the great Emperor had been murdered within a pace of me? I could not do it--no, I could not do it! There was but one course for an honourable gentleman whom Fate had placed in so cruel a position. I would fall upon my dishonoured sword, and so share, since I could not avert, the Emperor's fate. I rose with my nerves strung to this last piteous deed, and as I did so, my eyes fell upon something which struck the breath from my lips. The Emperor was standing before me! ...|$|R

60|$|Too weak {{to scrutinize}} {{thoroughly}} the mystery, I tried to settle it by {{saying it was}} a mistake, a dream, a fever-fit; and yet I knew {{there could be no}} mistake, and that I was not sleeping, and I believed I was sane.

All these objects, as well as the blue-damask furniture, were, in fact, precisely the same, in every minutest detail, with those I so well remembered, and with which I had been so thoroughly intimate, in the drawing-room of my godmother's house at Bretton.

60|$|Apart {{from this}} usage, which they {{practise}} {{in common with}} many thousand most estimable citizens, the Vermont gentleman, and the Kentucky whiskered lady--or did I say the reverse?--whichever you like my dear sir--were quite quiet, modest, unassuming people. She sat working with her needle, if I remember right. He, I suppose, slept in the great cabin, which was seventy feet long at the least, nor, I am bound to say, did I hear in the night any snores or roars, such as you would fancy ought to accompany the sleep of ogres. Nay, this giant had quite a small appetite, (unless, to be sure, he went forward and ate a sheep or two in private with his horrid knife--oh, the dreadful thought!--but IN PUBLIC, I say, he had quite a delicate appetite,) and was also a tea-totaler. I don't remember to have heard the lady's voice, though <b>I</b> <b>might,</b> <b>not</b> unnaturally, <b>have</b> been curious to hear it. Was her voice a deep, rich, magnificent bass; or was it soft, fluty, and mild? I shall never know now. Even if she comes to this country, I shall never go and see her.

60|$|Strange comment. <b>Might</b> <b>I</b> <b>not,</b> after <b>having</b> {{spoken of}} Dun Scotus's works, say;--"he is {{reported}} to have surpassed all his contemporaries in subtlety of logic:"--yet still mean no other works than those before mentioned? Are not Philo's works full of, crowded with, Platonic and Pythagorean philosophy? Eusebius knew from his works that he was a great Platonic scholar; but that he was greater than any other man of his age, he could only learn from report or history. That Virgil is a great poet I know from his poems; but that he was the greatest of the Augustan age, I must learn from Quinctilian and others.|$|R

60|$|Having {{heard only}} four {{reports from the}} muskets, I was {{led to believe that}} they were worked by the islanders {{in the same manner as}} the Sultan Solyman’s {{ponderous}} artillery at the siege of Byzantium, one of them taking an hour or two to load and train. At last, no sound whatever proceeding from the mountains, I concluded that the contest had been determined one way or the other. Such appeared, indeed, to be the case, for in a little while a courier arrived at the “Ti,” almost breathless with his exertions, and communicated the news of a great victory having been achieved by his countrymen: “Happar poo arva!—Happar poo arva!” (the cowards had fled). Kory-Kory was in ecstasies, and commenced a vehement harangue, which, so far as I understood it, implied that the result exactly agreed with his expectations, and which, moreover, was intended to convince me that it would be a perfectly useless undertaking, even for an army of fire-eaters, to offer battle to the irresistible heroes of our valley. In all this I of course acquiesced, and looked forward with no little interest to the return of the conquerors, whose victory <b>I</b> feared <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been purchased without cost to themselves.|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} large, {{and full of}} hardware, harness, saddles, blankets--everything that cowboys and ranchmen use. Several men, two in shirt-sleeves, were chatting near the door.

So I sat down to wait, determined to take Western ways and things as I found them. I sat there fifteen minutes by my watch. This was not so bad; but when a lanky, red-faced, leather-legged individual came in too he at once supplied with his wants, I began to get angry. I waited another five minutes, and still the friendly chatting went on. Finally I could stand it no longer.|$|R
