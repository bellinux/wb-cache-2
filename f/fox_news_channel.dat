5000|$|Contextual {{objectivity}} is {{a principle}} with roots in quantum mechanics that was adapted {{and applied to}} explain and describe the operations of news media organizations during times of war. Proposed by Adel Iskandar and Mohammed El-Nawawy in their analysis of Al-Jazeera as a case study, the term expresses the attempt [...] "to reflect all sides of any story while retaining the values, beliefs and sentiments of the target audience". The concept has been applied by some scholars to explain <b>Fox</b> News <b>Channel's</b> <b>news</b> programming in the 2002-2003 run-up to the Iraq war. Other studies used contextual objectivity to describe differences between mainstream media and alternative ethnic media's coverage of post-Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.|$|R
40|$|Social media {{websites}} allow {{users to}} communicate with each other through several tools like chats, discussion forums, comments etc. This results in learning and sharing of important information among the users. The nature of information on such social networking websites can be straight forward categorized as unstructured and fuzzy. In regular day-to-day discussions, spellings, grammar and sentence structure are usually neglected. This may prompt various sorts of ambiguities, for example, lexical, syntactic, and semantic, which makes it difficult to analyse and extract data patterns from such datasets. This study aims at analyzing textual data from Facebook and attempts to find interesting knowledge from such data and represent it in different forms. 33815 posts from 16 <b>news</b> <b>channels</b> pages over Facebook were extracted and analyzed. Different text mining techniques were applied on the collected data. Findings indicated that <b>Fox</b> <b>news</b> is the most <b>news</b> <b>channel</b> that share posts on Facebook, followed by CNN and ABC News respectively. Results revealed that the most frequent linked words are focused on the USA elections. Moreover, results revealed that most of the people are highly interested in sharing the news of Mohammed Ali Clay through all the <b>news</b> <b>channels.</b> Other implications and future perspectives are presented within the study...|$|R
40|$|Too often critics treat <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist {{brand and}} voice, {{its claim to}} stick up for the little guy as a gimmicky type of charlatanism {{that is used to}} convey simple and {{misleading}} news stories. However, in this dissertation, I demonstrate how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist journalistic style is in fact a sophisticated and complex form of political communication, one that requires great performative skill to embody, a deep knowledge of traditional political discourses, and an astute awareness of the key social and cultural cleavages active in a given historical moment. To capture the complexity of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist mode of address, in this study, I conduct a critical-textual analysis of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top three programs during the late- 2000 s Recession : Glenn Beck, Hannity, and The O'Reilly Factor. This involves a close reading of the "imagined community" <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> style is designed to address and how its style is crafted to create a political identity for viewers. While partisan identification with the Republican Party and political conservatism defines the broadest parameters of Fox's imagined community, the real power and ideological utility of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> mode of address, I argue, derive from its cultural referents, particularly, how it aligns deep moral values and social archetypes from the American populist rhetorical tradition with the political right, marking populism as conservative. In {{the first half of this}} dissertation, I develop a theoretical model for interpreting <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> unique populist address, which includes an analysis of how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top programs attempt to draw symbolic linkages between political conservatism and the white working- class. In the second half of the dissertation, I demonstrate the power of this rhetorical approach by showing how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top programs framed news about the late- 2000 s Recession to fashion a conservative economic agend...|$|R

5|$|Rhonda Latimer, {{an aging}} {{reporter}} for <b>Fox</b> <b>News</b> <b>Channel</b> who is idolized by viewers {{because of her}} good looks, is dismissed when the network's first high-definition broadcast exposes her wrinkles, leaving a job opportunity open. Lois auditions for the part, ignoring Brian's warnings that Fox News is a heavily biased network, and she is chosen as the new reporter. On her first day reporting, she is assigned to do an exposé on Michael Moore {{to prove that he}} is a homosexual. When she spies on him outside his house, she sees Rush Limbaugh coming out, leading her to conclude that Limbaugh and Moore are in a gay relationship. However, Fox News refuses to allow any material against fellow conservative Limbaugh to be broadcast, leading Lois to realize that Brian was right about them. The two decide to take the story into their own hands and confront who they expect to be Moore and a naked Limbaugh in the same bedroom, only to discover that the both of them are portrayed by Fred Savage, who has created bodysuits of them in order to continue his acting career. A flabbergasted Lois ultimately decides to report his story instead.|$|E
