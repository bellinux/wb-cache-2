Sometime after this, she met the witch-priestess, Ainet, who took her in and became her surrogate mother. Once, when their village {{was going through a}} terrible drought, Storm commanded rain for days just to help them. By doing this, she threw off the natural order of nature, and droughts were formed over numerous villages, and hundreds of animals were killed. Sensing the damage she had done, Ainet told Storm of <b>her</b> <b>kind</b> but ill-thought-out gesture, and of the damage she caused. Ainet took this opportunity to explain to Ororo how her powers worked with nature, and how she could fix the problem by properly distributing rain.|$|E

25|$|Upon signing her {{deal with}} Atlantic Records, Marion Raven set about {{recording}} her debut album, {{and worked with}} Swedish songwriters/producers Max Martin and Rami, as well as Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk and her husband Raine Maida from 2003 to 2005. Initially, the record company was not confident of Raven's switch to a more rock image and a darker, more personal style of songwriting. Raven had to fight to record <b>her</b> <b>kind</b> of music, rock music with a pop element. The resulting 14-track list, including 2 bonus tracks, cultivated a more rock/pop sound and was titled Here I Am. The album saw Raven's transformation from the candy-pop music of M2M to a more angsty, rock-oriented singer, and was released in Scandinavia, Japan, Latin America and Southeast Asia.|$|E

Hōshō was actively used to develop carrier operational methods and tactics for the IJN during the 1920s. She {{was assigned to the}} First Carrier Division with Akagi on 1 April 1928.

[...] Diana is a dangerous femme fatale, who is [...] "beautiful, sexy and strong". TV Soap said {{she is a woman}} on a mission. Badler described her character's background saying she had a dysfunctional upbringing, which made her strong and a fighter. Diana has had to fight for everything in her life, so she works hard in order to survive. Badler added in an interview with Network Ten that Diana is highly ambitious and very driven, which makes <b>her</b> <b>kind</b> of like a man. Diana is one of the chiefs of Lassiter's International, but she knows that she will not get {{to the top of the}} company because Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) is the heir to the Robinson fortune.|$|E

500|$|Nine {{years after}} the fateful heist, Trevor finds out that Michael faked his death, and is so spooked and enraged that he breaks the truce and kills most of his {{competition}} in one burst of violence, a deadly streak that continues when a potential game-changing deal with the Triads falls through. He drives to Los Santos, taking over the apartment and ruining the life of Wade's cousin Floyd, and reunites with Michael, who now took on the name [...] "De Santa". After Michael introduces Trevor to Franklin Clinton, the two perform heists again, this time including Franklin. Trevor is determined to rob anything guarded by Merryweather Security Consulting, a private security firm that he dislikes, but he often fails. After not getting paid for a job, Trevor kidnaps Patricia, the wife of kingpin Martin Madrazo. Due to <b>her</b> <b>kind</b> maternal nature and his own abandonment issues, Trevor {{falls in love with}} her and only returns her after much demanding from Michael.

500|$|The Doctor {{goes back}} inside to {{question}} Signora Calvierri who confirms {{that she and}} the others are from the planet Saturnyne, a race of aquatic beings with vampire-like tendencies. [...] She and the others landed on Earth after seeing the cracks in the universe.

500|$|Stevie is {{the privately}} educated {{daughter}} of rich parents, who have abandoned {{her to go}} travelling. [...] She {{is said to be}} clueless about real life, with her profile on the official E20 website describing her as generous, creative and unlucky in love, though she has a boyfriend. Although she is described as posh, Fairbank-Hynes said Stevie is not just like a posh girl in East London, but would be out of place anywhere as she is in her own world. Fairbank-Hynes opined that posh characters in Walford stand out and can bring comedy to the show. Stevie is very naive and, according to Fairbank-Hynes, [...] "away with the fairies"—the most naive person anyone could meet. However, writer Emer Kenny was worried that Stevie being [...] "away with the fairies" [...] would make her unrealistic, but said that Fairbank-Hynes made the character recognisable. Because of Stevie's naivety and <b>her</b> <b>kind</b> nature, people see this as an invitation to take advantage of her. Stevie does not understand why people are cruel to her because she sees the good in them and wants to look after them, be around people and mother them. Fairbank-Hynes commented, [...] "Stevie's {{the type of person who}} thinks a stranger is a friend she hasn't met yet". However, Stevie is very forward, which can scare people away. She is also creative, empathetic and a complete daydreamer who lacks common sense but has bursts of assertiveness and intelligence, which can surprise people. Thompson said that Stevie has a good balance as she can be ditzy but also quite smart. Fairbank-Hynes identified with the character's mad outbursts, innocence and daydreaming, and also said Stevie is quirky, lovely and eccentric. Her daydreaming can lead people to believe she is a bimbo, but she is not.|$|E

500|$|With Shadar defeated, Oliver {{prepares to}} return home, but the White Witch appears and casts a spell known as [...] "manna", an ash-like {{substance}} that turns all living beings {{in the three}} major cities into undead-like creatures. A girl named Pea, who has been appearing to Oliver on occasion, travels with the group and uses her magic to clear the cities of manna and restore the people to normal; the group then travel to defeat the White Witch herself. They discover {{that she was a}} young queen called Cassiopeia from thousands of years ago who had noble intentions, but was manipulated by her [...] "council of twelve", calling themselves the Zodiarchs, who desired to run the country. Feeling powerless, she found and used the manna spell, believing it would bring peace and prosperity to her people. When the horrific effects of manna were revealed, she gradually witnessed the death of all of her subjects, including the council, and found herself on her own; she was gradually driven to despair and became the White Witch, believing that all life must be destroyed in an attempt to [...] "start over". Her power created an illusory version of the council to oversee the destruction of the world, but the remains of <b>her</b> <b>kind</b> intentions also created the council member that helped the group by sending them back in time, as well as Pea, the incarnation of her as a child. Having been defeated, Cassiopeia fuses together with Pea and is restored to her former, kind self. After assisting the group in destroying the Zodiarchy, the last manifestations of the council, Cassiopeia declares that she will dedicate her life to making amends for her actions and Oliver bids farewell to his friends before returning to his old life in Motorville.|$|E

Duke later said Robson [...] "continually treated [...] like an imbecile, which she definitely was not, and she was very attuned and sensitive to this treatment". Polanski later quoted Robson as saying to him, [...] "That's a great girl you're living with. Few actresses have <b>her</b> <b>kind</b> of vulnerability. She's got a great future." ...|$|E
