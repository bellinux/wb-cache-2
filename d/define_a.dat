5|$|A Markov {{chain is}} a type of Markov process that has either {{discrete}} state space or discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies. For example, it is common to <b>define</b> <b>a</b> Markov chain as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous time with a countable state space (thus regardless of the nature of time), but it is also common to <b>define</b> <b>a</b> Markov chain as having discrete time in either countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space).|$|E

5|$|Given a {{set with}} an {{addition}} operation, one cannot always <b>define</b> <b>a</b> corresponding subtraction operation on that set; {{the set of}} natural numbers is a simple example. On the other hand, a subtraction operation uniquely determines an addition operation, an additive inverse operation, and an additive identity; for this reason, an additive group {{can be described as}} a set that is closed under subtraction.|$|E
5|$|In other areas, such as formal analysis, {{it is more}} {{convenient}} to work directly with the power series themselves. Thus one may <b>define</b> <b>a</b> solution of a differential equation as a power series which, one hopes to prove, is the Taylor series of the desired solution.|$|E
5|$|These {{operations}} <b>define</b> <b>a</b> symmetry {{relation between}} equivalent grids. Excluding relabeling, and {{with respect to}} the 81 grid cell values, the operations form a subgroup of the symmetric group S81, of order 3!8×2=3,359,232. Applying the above operations on majority of the grids results in 3!8×2×9! essentially equivalent grids. Exceptions are Automorphic Sudokus which due to additional non-trivial symmetry generate fewer grids.|$|E

5|$|A {{clinical}} exam {{is often}} used {{as a means to}} diagnose CSF leaks. Improved patient response to conservative treatment may further <b>define</b> <b>a</b> positive diagnosis. The lack of clinician awareness of the signs -symptoms and ailments- of a CSF leak is the greatest challenge to proper diagnosis and treatment, in particular: the loss of the orthostatic characteristic of headache and that every chronic CSF leaker will have a unique symptom set that as a whole contributes to the underlying condition, and diagnosis of, a CSF leak.|$|E
5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to <b>define</b> <b>a</b> common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
