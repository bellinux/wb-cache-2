40|$|Background: Cross-cultural {{differences}} in {{attitudes and practices}} related to diabetes are well-known. Similar {{differences in}} symptom reporting of endocrine conditions such as menopause are well documented. Minimal literature {{is available on the}} cross-cultural variation in reporting of hypoglycemic symptoms. Aims: This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the symptoms of hypoglycemia encountered by <b>diabetologists</b> who deal with patients from different language groups from various states of North and West India and Nepal. Materials and Methods: Eighty three doctors from six Indian states and Nepal, attending a continuing medical education program were requested to fill a detailed, pre-tested, Likert scale based questionnaire which assessed the frequency and symptoms with which patients presented with hypoglycemia in their clinical practice. Data were analyzed based on geographic location of the <b>diabetologists</b> and language spoken by their patients (Hindi vs. Gujarati). Results: Gujarati-speaking patients tended to report to their doctors, a greater inability to work under pressure and a higher frequency of intense hunger during hypoglycemia. They were less likely to report specific adrenergic (inward trembling), neuroglycopenic (feeling down over nothing), and nocturnal (crumpled bedsheets upon waking up) symptoms. Conclusion: Significant cross-cultural differences related to the symptomatology of hypoglycemia are noted.

40|$|Andrologists, cardiologists and <b>diabetologists</b> (and general practitioners) {{have the}} great {{opportunity}} to collaborate and find shared clinical workup {{for the benefit of}} a large number of men. Several evidence established a link between erectile dysfunction (ED), cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Not only these conditions share many risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms but also an emerging paradigm indicates that ED is, in fact, an independent marker of cardiovascular disease risk, CV events and CV mortality. However, there is no consensus on the best cardiologic investigation in men with ED with no known CVD and, on the contrary, on what is the clinical and prognostic role of detecting ED during cardiovascular investigation and CVD risk assessment. Only vasculogenic ED, which represents the most common type of organic ED, indeed represents a harbinger of CVD, especially for younger patients, and might be diagnosed by dynamic penile color doppler ultrasonography, which represents a real cardiovascular imaging technique that give evidence on the presence of systemic endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, assessment of glucose and lipid metabolism is warranted as first step workup in all ED patients, and <b>diabetologists</b> should ask their patients for erectile function, address ED patients to andrologists, and consider vasculogenic ED in the context of the cardiovascular and metabolic workup and in the context of diabetic complications.

40|$|SUMMARY Psychological {{adjustment}} to {{type 2 diabetes}} Objective. Based upon {{the literature of the}} past ten years, this study analyzes the initial phase of psychological adjustment after a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, with the goal of providing useful guidelines to <b>diabetologists</b> in supporting their patients from the very first moment of clinical work. The study identifies five functional areas that characterize this adjustment: anxiety, depression, locus of control, self-esteem and self-efficacy. Method. Using a battery of psychometric tests, we assessed the psychological condition in a sample of 42 subjects with type 2 diabetes, comparing with a control sample of 420 subjects, without diabetes. Results. The initial psychological adjustment after six months from diagnosis, seems characterized by decreased tone of mood and self-efficacy, without anxious symptoms. The subjects seem to develop a fatalistic attitude or a strong external entrustment, showing inclination to underestimate the disease’s reality and to seek external dependence that could affect the path towards an adequate and effective self-management. Conclusions. The authors discuss the findings emerged and possible directions for a smoother working relationship between <b>diabetologists</b> and their patients...|$|R

40|$|This {{symposium}} {{aimed to}} address the current issues {{in the management of}} patients with Type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS), bringing together the views of both cardiologists and <b>diabetologists.</b> T 2 D increases the risk of ACS and is associated with a poorer prognosis for these patients. Although guidelines provide comprehensive recommendations for patients with ACS, specific guidance is lacking following hospital discharge for those with concomitant T 2 D. As a result, these patients receive suboptimal treatment compared with patients without T 2 D. The cardiovascular (CV) benefits of intensive glucose lowering alone for those with T 2 D are uncertain. However, knowledge of the CV safety profiles of available therapies helps <b>diabetologists</b> to provide individualised treatment for their patients. Currently, three studies have reported on the CV safety of dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) inhibitors in patients with T 2 D. However, active inclusion of patients who are both post-ACS (15 – 90 days) and at high risk of CV disease (CVD) is rare. Only the DPP- 4 alogliptin has been assessed in a CV safety outcome study in patients with this specific profile...|$|R
