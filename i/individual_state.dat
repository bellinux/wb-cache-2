5|$|In 2006, the Association of Boxing Commissions (ABC) held a {{committee}} meeting {{to revise the}} Unified Rules. During it, Kizer and Lembo proposed altering the rule on downward elbow strikes to permit 12-6 elbows to anywhere except {{the head of a}} downed opponent. However, the proposal was strongly rejected by doctors on the committee on the grounds that 12-6 elbows could still cause serious injury, even when not done on the head. The ABC, despite endorsing the Unified Rules, does not have statutory authority over the <b>individual</b> <b>state</b> athletic commissions in the United States though governs through influence. As a result, in some states such as Mississippi, 12-6 elbows are permitted in MMA fights. As a result, a commission was set up by ABC to look at the regional MMA rule variations, including 12-6 elbows, to standardise MMA in the United States.|$|E
