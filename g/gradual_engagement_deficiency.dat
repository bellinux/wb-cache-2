In this chapter, we focus on aspects of peripheral interaction in proxemic interactions. We illustrate how to facilitate transitions between interaction outside the attentional field, the periphery, {{and the center of}} attention by means of the Proxemic Flow peripheral floor display. We summarize and generalize our findings into two design patterns: slow-motion feedback and <b>gradual</b> <b>engagement.</b> We propose slow-motion feedback as a way to draw attention to actions happening in the background and provide opportunities for intervention, while <b>gradual</b> <b>engagement</b> provides peripheral awareness of action possibilities and discoverability and reveals possible future interactions...|$|R
40|$|Connecting and {{information}} transfer between {{the increasing number}} of personal and shared digital devices in our environment – phones, tablets, and large surfaces – is tedious. One has to know which devices can communicate, what information they contain, and how information can be exchanged. Inspired by Proxemic Interactions, we introduce novel interaction techniques that allow people to naturally connect to and perform cross-device operations. Our techniques are based on the notion of <b>gradual</b> <b>engagement</b> between a person’s handheld device and the other devices surrounding them as a function of fine-grained measures of proximity. They all provide awareness of device presence and connectivity, progressive reveal of available digital content, and interaction methods for transferring digital content between devices from a distance and from close proximity. They also illustrate how <b>gradual</b> <b>engagement</b> may differ when the other device seen is personal (such as a handheld) vs. semi-public (such as a large display). We illustrate our techniques within two applications that enable <b>gradual</b> <b>engagement</b> leading up to information exchange between digital devices.

40|$|Introduction Since its {{inception}} in 1955, the harmonic drive has found widespread acceptance among practitioners. This mechanical transmission, occasionally called "strain-wave gearing", employs a continuous deflection wave along non-rigid gear to allow for <b>gradual</b> <b>engagement</b> of gear teeth (Figure 1). Because of this unconventional gear-tooth meshing action, harmonic drives can deliver high reduction ratios {{in a very small}} package. In fact, the radical mechanical operation of this gear train defies conventional understanding of gear behaviour and creates a new arena for exploration and understanding. Figure 1 : Harmonic drive components The harmonic drive exhibits performance features both superior and inferior to conventional gear transmissions. Its performance advantages include high torque capacity, concentric geometry, lightweight and compact design, zero backlash, high efficiency, and back drivability. Harmonic drive systems suffer however, from high fle...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of digital devices in our environment enriches how we interact with digital content. Yet, crossdevice information transfer – which should be a common operation – is surprisingly difficult. One has to know which devices can communicate, what information they contain, and how information can be exchanged. To mitigate this problem, we formulate the <b>gradual</b> <b>engagement</b> design pattern that generalizes prior work in proxemic interactions and informs future system designs. The pattern describes how we can design device interfaces to gradually engage the user by disclosing connectivity and information exchange capabilities {{as a function of}} inter-device proximity. These capabilities flow across three stages: (1) awareness of device presence/connectivity, (2) reveal of exchangeable content, and (3) interaction methods for transferring content between devices tuned to particular distances and device capabilities. We illustrate how we can apply this pattern to design, and show how existing and novel interaction techniques for cross-device transfers can be integrated to flow across its various stages. We explore how techniques differ between personal and semi-public devices, and how the pattern supports interaction of multiple users.

40|$|Evaluation of the {{mechanical}} properties of arterial wall components is necessary for establishing a precise mechanical model applicable in various physiological and pathological conditions, such as remodeling. In this contribution, a new approach {{for the evaluation of}} {{the mechanical}} properties of aortic media accounting for the lamellar structure is proposed. We assumed aortic media to be composed of two sets of concentric layers, namely sheets of elastin (Layer I) and interstitial layers composed of mostly collagen bundles, fine elastic fibers and smooth muscle cells (Layer II). Biaxial mechanical tests were carried out on human thoracic aortic samples, and histological staining was performed to distinguish wall lamellae for determining the dimensions of the layers. A neo-Hookean strain energy function (SEF) for Layer I and a four-parameter exponential SEF for Layer II were allocated. Nonlinear regression was used to find the material parameters of the proposed microstructural model based on experimental data. The non-linear behavior of media layers confirmed the higher contribution of elastic tissue in lower strains and the <b>gradual</b> <b>engagement</b> of collagen fibers. The resulting model determines the nonlinear anisotropic behavior of aortic media through the lamellar microstructure and can be assistive in the study of wall remodeling due to alterations in lamellar structure during pathological conditions and aging...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to investigate}} the changes or transitions that occur in teachers as they move from a traditional basal delivery to a holistic, integrated delivery when teaching reading/language arts. ^ Ten elementary teachers from eight different educational settings in the midwest, who were enrolled in a whole language workshop, were chosen to participate through purposive sampling. Data were collected from initial and exit interviews, classroom observations, and reflective journaling. Grounded theory was generated through constant comparative methodology which was used simultaneously to collect and analyze data. ^ The grounded theory included six theoretical propositions and supporting evidence: (1) A precondition to voluntary teacher change is a <b>gradual</b> <b>engagement</b> in an evolutionary process which is influenced by a variety of factors, (2) Subjects 2 ̆ 7 involvement in a whole language workshop provided a structure for predicting obstacles and changes that might be encountered during the transitional process, (3) Time emerged as the most problematic factor during the transitional process, (4) Supportive, affirming incidences enabled subjects to cope with attitudinal, philosophical, and methodological changes, (5) Professional and personal growth occurred {{as a result of the}} subjects 2 ̆ 7 involvement in the transitional process, (6) Significant teacher change focused on a student-centered learning community where curriculum was driven by social interaction and ideas of interest meaningful to students. ^ Substantive theory constructed from the theoretical propositions indicates that teachers involved in a voluntary change process arrive at this threshold in an evolutionary fashion, drawing on incidences from life-long experiences with literacy and learning. For these subjects, a workshop setting provided a structure of definition to predict unknown obstacles. These teachers continued to change and grow both personally and professionally with supportive and affirming incidences, in spite of their perceived lack of time. Their shift from a teacher-centered to a student-centered learning environment was an important change. ...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decade an {{increasing}} awareness regard the 'new food equation' (Morgan and Sonnino 2010) – and the very tangible challenges that entails – started growing significantly among different governments in the Global North. In only few years time a unique 'wave' of worldwide institutional attention has arisen and {{a new generation of}} urban and regional planning tools – the 'food strategies' – was born (the Toronto, London, Amsterdam and New York ones represent {{only a small part of}} them). Nevertheless, in order to make 'food system thinking' operable on governance level and turn visions into reality, a high degree of 'creativity' (Kunzmann 2004) and innovation was being required from local administrations. Perhaps one of the most compelling answers that stemmed from this pressing demand is represented by the so-called 'food policy councils' (FPCs). As Mark Winne observes: "Though lacking authority and respectable budgets, these entities have become de facto food system planning agencies" (Winne 2004 : 15). The present paper will advance the hypothesis that FPCs (and alike organisations) in many occasions have constituted the strategic catalyst that made it possible for 'food planning' visions to 'travel' through different "institutional sites in a governance landscape, penetrate governance processes and sediment into governance cultures" (Healey 2007 : 23). In particular, by taking advantage of relevant examples from both North-American and Western-European cities, the influence of three distinct aspects over such transformative dynamics will be examined. A first area of investigation will focus on how conditions like FPCs 'location' and 'degree of integration into a city government' (Dahlberg 1994) increase or weaken their credibility and 'persuasive' capacity. Such conditions will also be examined with relation to the necessary factors for delivering more 'electoral cycle'-proof strategies. The paper will then explore how the different strategies' predominant connotations (health, labour, 'zero carbon' growth, poverty, etc.) reflect different city departments 'sensitizing' and, accordingly, diverse food system governance 'capacities' (Mendes 2008) development. Finally, in the third part, will be addressed the relevance of 'scale' and how the 'food planning' inherent complexity is fostering the <b>gradual</b> <b>engagement</b> of multiple governance levels (e. g. the city of Boston, having already a city FPC, has asked for the establishment of a state-wide one, while New York City is doing vice-versa). The paper will conclude rising some key questions on the relationship between cities' size and the opportunities for the sustainable food paradigm to transform their 'mainstream' planning processes and cultures (Healey 2004) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{emerges from}} my own {{concerns}} about how North American evangelicals approach social and environmental challenges. As an evangelical pastor I continue to be troubled {{by the lack of}} attention paid by evangelicals to actually making the world a better place. I began by investigating the theological reasons behind the evangelicals’ lack of commitment to social amelioration. In those studies I discovered eschatological concepts that shaped the evangelicals’ attitudes towards the socio-political world. Therefore, this thesis is an exploration of a cluster of related, yet complex subjects: evangelicals, eschatology, and social engagement. The primary aim of this thesis is to address the eschatology that shapes the approaches evangelicals take in engaging with the social and environmental challenges of our day. This thesis begins by describing the historical roots of contemporary evangelical eschatological theology. Having described the complexity of evangelical eschatology, the second chapter offers a sustained reflection on the neo-evangelical critique of the pessimistic eschatological theologies that emerged from the Fundamentalist movement. Through the neo-evangelical critique, this thesis then analyzes some of the more significant problems with contemporary evangelical social <b>engagement.</b> Those <b>deficiencies</b> are brought into dialogue with the Hope Theology of Jürgen Moltmann. Moltmann’s proposed eschatological theology coincides with the neo-evangelical proposal of an inaugurated-enacted eschatology. This inaugurated-enacted eschatological theology is then used in the construction of my own theological proposal for a theology of social engagement for evangelicals. This theological proposal identifies several key ideas posited by an inaugurated-enacted eschatology and then applies these ideas to evangelical notions of biblicism, crucicentrism, conversionism, and activism. A final chapter explores the potential of my proposed theology of social <b>engagement</b> for overcoming <b>deficiencies</b> in evangelical environmental theologies. This final chapter demonstrates the efficacy of my proposed evangelical theology of social engagement for improving evangelical approaches to social and environmental amelioration. Throughout this thesis I claim that evangelical can and must {{do a better job of}} addressing the social and environmental issues of our day. My contribution is to offer an eschatological framework for improving evangelical theologies of social engagement...|$|R
40|$|An under-studied {{dimension}} of Irenaeus’s exegetical practice is his {{extensive use of}} Hellenistic literary-critical techniques. He couples this usage with a consistent claim that the meaning of texts should primarily be established by attending to the “clear” or “manifest” sense of terms and expressions. Irenaeus’s practice culminates a <b>gradual</b> and deepening <b>engagement</b> with these techniques apparent in earlier Christian texts, but the suddenness and striking quality of his advance is best explained by seeing him as reacting to the Val-entinian production of commentary literature that claims the cultural capital of ancient literary-critical techniques to justify reading the texts of the “New Testament” as enigmatic ciphers for Valentinian myths. Irenaeus responds by making a distinct claim on the same cultural capital—one that utilizes an established anti-allegorical rhetoric—to justify his own practice. Understanding Irenaeus’s particular adaptation of ancient literary-critical practice provides a deeper context for considering his emphasis on reading {{in the light of}} the regula veritatis. In so doing he becomes a foundational figure in shaping the exegetical practice so central to early Christianity in the centuries that follow...|$|R
40|$|Planned {{community}} relocation or “resettlement” is not new, {{however the}} {{contexts in which}} people are being relocated and the safeguards in place to protect them are changing. Multilateral development banks are under competing pressures to minimise the negative impacts of community resettlement without over-burdening the governments of borrowing countries. Intensive debates are underway about what rights should be afforded to resettled people and what safeguards are most effective. Similar concerns are being voiced by policy-makers working on climate change adaptation, who are looking to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) to identify ways to safeguard communities being resettled in response to climate change. One of the most important tensions shaping these debates, is how resettlement safeguards developed at an international or “global” level can cater to the needs and aspirations of affected people in different local settings. As a contribution to this debate, this thesis explores a resettlement scheme for an ADB co-financed railway project in Cambodia in which advocacy interventions resulted in significant improvements in the resettlement sites over the eight years of the project from 2006 to 2014. Drawing on the railway project as a case study, the research focuses on understanding how safeguards, developed at a “headquarter level”, aligned and misaligned with community needs and aspirations at different points in time. It investigates how advocacy interventions altered the course of the project and considers the implications of relying on resettlement safeguards in a country where domestic legal protections are otherwise not well-established. The research is founded on an appreciation of the valuable literature that exists to understand resettlement. It uses legal geography and theories of scale to build on the conceptual frameworks already available. It does this through analysing the socio-legal dimensions of the resettlement process from multiple stakeholder perspectives over time. This approach enables a close field-based analysis of how different actors (communities, NGOs, governments and financiers) experienced and understood resettlement tensions at different scales: at a community level in five locations in Cambodia, and at national, international and institutional scales. Through a qualitative analysis of different stakeholder perspectives, the research goes behind the scenes and behind the paper work to investigate how the risks and impacts of the project were rationalised by decision-makers as they unfolded. It draws on interviews with NGOs, consultants, safeguards and resettlement specialists in Cambodia and other sites of decision-making and institutional influence: especially within the ADB, World Bank and Australian Government. From a community perspective, the resettlement process was an uneven and arbitrary experience, but the reactions were different across the five resettlement sites. Like many resettlement schemes, the rights and benefits available to affected people were determined by the precise physical space in which they lived prior to the project. Rather than following the natural contours of how communities were living, the scheme drew new lines of social organisation based on the ADB resettlement policy guidelines. Intensive NGO interventions using creative trans-national strategies brought international scrutiny to the project. Yet, as additional compensation was provided and services and infrastructure slowly improved in the resettlement sites, the resettlement dynamics began to change. The appeal of resettlement increased for many community members who were left behind. Over time resettlement standards improved in some of the sites so much that they became “islands of governance”, demarcated or ring-fenced from the otherwise limited support provided to people partially-affected by the project but not given the option of relocation. While efforts were made by NGOs to advocate for those who were partially affected, but not relocated, clear limitations in the scope of the safeguards policy emerged. NGOs were required to navigate complex community tensions, revealing how conflicting community interests and aspirations, which inevitably characterise resettlement, are also inherently difficult to incorporate into advocacy campaigns. The experiences described provide rich insights into the realities of being embroiled in so-called “community-driven accountability processes”, as well as the adaptation strategies community members employed to navigate resettlement. The research explores how community awareness of resettlement safeguards was built through contact with NGOs, and also through the <b>gradual</b> <b>engagement</b> of ADB staff once the project’s impacts were publicised. Over time, community members developed a sophisticated understanding of the rights and benefits afforded by the project and the ADB safeguards and accountability framework in place. From the perspectives of financiers, the interviews also reveal how debates about the “right” way to address resettlement problems were occurring within the ADB, Cambodian and Australian Governments, and there were many points of controversy among staff members and consultants. There were also many disagreements behind the scenes about the adequacy of the resettlement processes in place, due diligence and accountability. The case of the Cambodian railway project conveys how resettlement impacts are not easily overcome through internal monitoring, supervision and technical assistance at a project level, even where these aspects of a project are well resourced. These challenges are particularly complex in places where there is a significant disparity between national government standards for resettlement and international, project-specific safeguards, {{as is the case in}} Cambodia. The research conveys the extent of influence that international financiers have on the quality of resettlement within the bounds of a given project, as well as the limits of this influence on other aspects of governance external to these projects. The research supports a move away from simple approaches to resettlement premised on the notion that it is possible to mitigate negative social and environmental impacts of infrastructure projects only through the establishment of safeguards and monitoring systems. Instead it supports an approach which more explicitly includes local civil society actors and international advocacy NGOs, recognising the valuable roles they play...|$|R
