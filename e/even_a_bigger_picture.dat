50|$|A {{horizontal}} {{variant of}} 70 mm, with <b>an</b> <b>even</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>picture</b> area, {{is used for}} the high-performance IMAX format which uses a frame that is 15 perforations wide on 70 mm film. The Dynavision and Astrovision systems each use slightly less film per frame and vertical pulldown to save print costs while being able to project onto an IMAX screen. Both were rare, with Astrovision largely used in Japanese planetariums. In the 2014 movie Interstellar, a significant amount was shot in the IMAX format. Other scenes were shot in either 35 mm or in the standard 'vertical' 5-perf 65 mm format. IMAX introduced a digital projection system in the late 2000s and most IMAX venues have migrated to digital setup.|$|R
