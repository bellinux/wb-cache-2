50|$|Throughout the 1990s, the Chinese Football Association were {{demanding}} more professionalism from their football teams. Guangzhou {{was one of}} the first fully professional football clubs in China after the Apollo Group took over the club on 8 January 1993. The <b>investment</b> <b>aided</b> the manager Zhou Suian to help create a competitive squad. Hu Zhijun won the top goalscoring award. Guangzhou were able to gain a runners-up spot at the 1994 league season. The following season Zhou Suian left the team after having twice guided the club to a runners-up position within the league and a runners up spot against Shanghai in the 1991 Chinese FA Cup. After his exit, the club were unable to replicate the same results. When influential international footballers Peng Weiguo and Hu Zhijun left the club, the team went into free fall and were relegated at the end of the 1998 league season. With the management concerned about the team's performance, an investigation was launched which discovered that Wen Junwu and three other players were in collusion with gambling groups and were immediately expelled from the club. In 2001, the Guangzhou Sports Bureau took over the club again. With significant investment coming from the Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., Ltd it was hoped that the club could push for promotion. The division was rocked by a match-fixing scandal involving Changchun Yatai, Chengdu Wuniu, Jiangsu Sainty and Zhejing Greentown. Guangzhou's new sponsors Geely immediately pulled their funding from the team to distance themselves from the bad publicity. The club went through a tough transitional period until the Sunray Cave Group took over the club in 2004 and started to invest money in hopes of pushing for promotion. When the Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals group took over the club in 2006, they were able to realize the ambition of gaining promotion. The club won the 2007 division title and entry to the Chinese Super League.In February 2010, Guangzhou was relegated back to the China League One in the fallout of a match-fixing scandal despite having achieved a ninth-place finish in the 2009 season. The match in question was the 19 August 2006 league game against Shanxi Luhu, which Guangzhou won 5-1 when they were still playing in the China League One. It was discovered by the police that the Guangzhou general manager Yang Xu paid ¥200,000 to the opposing general manager Wang Po to secure a win at home and that Guangzhou's vice president's Wu Xiaodong and Xie Bin knew about it. With the offending participants sentenced to jail for fraud, the club was put up for sale. On 28 February 2010, Evergrande Real Estate Group took over the club for a fee of ¥100 million. Xu Jiayin, chairman of Evergrande Real Estate Group, said that they would pump more funds into the transfer market. His first act was to sign in Chinese national team striker Gao Lin from Shanghai Shenhua for a reported fee of ¥6 million, then he replaced the head coach Peng Weiguo with former Beijing Guoan manager Lee Jang-Soo with no indication. In the 2010 summer transfer window, the club signed Sun Xiang, the first Chinese footballer to play in the UEFA Champions League with PSV Eindhoven, and Chinese national team captain Zheng Zhi on 28 June 2010. On 30 June 2010, Guangzhou confirmed that they had signed Muriqui on a four-year deal from Campeonato Brasileiro Série A side Atlético Mineiro with a domestic record fee of ¥23 million. On 30 October 2010, Guangzhou became League One champions for the second time and returned to the Super League after a 3-1 win against Hunan Billows.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between private forest investments and public cost sharing (government financial <b>aid</b> to private <b>investment</b> projects) was first analysed with an economic optimization model. In the general case the model predicted that cost-sharing causes substitution between private funding of <b>investments</b> and public <b>aid.</b> However, in some special cases complementarities were not ruled out. Next, the model predictions were tested with a translog cost function specification of forest investment fund shares. Aggregate data from Finland in years 1963 / 2000 were used. The substitution and own price elasticities of purely private, subsidized individual and subsidized collective investments {{are derived from}} maximum likelihood estimates of translog system model, allowing for investment scale effects.

40|$|This {{paper is}} timely because it {{critically}} examines {{the influence of}} African-Americans on U. S. trade, foreign direct <b>investment</b> and <b>aid</b> toward the Sub-Saharan African Countries in the late 1970 s, a dimension that has been largely overlooked in foreign policy analysis, despite its critical significance. In fact, African-American influence in U. S. trade, foreign direct <b>investment</b> and <b>aid</b> policy toward Africa is an aspect that has so far received scanty attention regarding their ancestral homeland. For much of early 1960 s, African-American community identified with African countries in their decolonization struggles, economic sanction against former apartheid South Africa and a complete withdrawal of U. S. military aid to the Tshombe administration in the Congo. The low priority given to African countries in the U. S. foreign policy raises question(s) on the place of African Americans in the U. S. foreign policy, especially {{in the realm of}} trade, foreign direct <b>investment</b> and <b>aid</b> between the late 1970 s and early 1980 s. In this paper, we argue that there is significant relationship between the volume of trade, foreign direct <b>investment</b> and <b>aid</b> enjoyed by African countries from the U. S. foreign policy regarding Sub-Saharan Africa, and the influence of African-Americans on the US-African foreign policy, especially in the late 1970 s. The paper examined the active role played by the Congressional Black Caucus, NAACP, Trans-Africa, Africare, African-American political and religious leaders holding important positions in the U. S government. The methodology for this paper is mainly descriptive and relies on Government Documents, Journals, Newspapers, Reports from the United States Department of Trade and Commerce (USDTC), books and the internet, among others. The paper concludes that the activities undertaken by African-Americans have positive impact on the U. S. foreign policy toward their ancestral homeland like other ethnic groups, such as Jewish- Americans; Irish-Americans, Polish-Americans and Armenian- Americans. The conclusion is derived from the volume of trade, foreign direct <b>investment</b> and <b>aid.</b> The policy challenge for this paper is how to maximize the influence of African-American Community on U.
