5|$|Encouraged by a friend, {{she went}} to Paris to become a writer but had little success. While in Paris Eberhardt met the widow of Marquis de Morès. Although deMorès was {{reportedly}} murdered by Tuareg tribesmen in the Sahara, {{no one had been}} arrested. When his widow learned that Eberhardt was familiar with the area where deMorès died, she hired her to investigate his murder. The job benefited Eberhardt, who was destitute and longed to return to the Sahara. She returned to Algeria in July 1900, settling in El Oued. According to Sahara expert R. V. C. Bodley, Eberhardt made little effort to investigate deMorès' death; Bodley considered this due to a combination of the unwillingness of the French to co-operate in an investigation and Eberhardt's fatalism rather than deliberate dishonesty. Word eventually <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deMorès widow about Eberhardt's lackluster investigation, and she subsequently cut off her funding.|$|E

They had no key so the manager {{opened the door}} for them. According to the roommate (speaking after Duggan's death to Duggan's girlfriend), Duggan could not sleep and kept switching the lights on and off.

25|$|Word of his {{exploits}} <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> President, {{who ordered}} General Winfield Scott {{to see to}} Lowe's formation of a balloon corps, with Lowe as Chief Aeronaut. It was almost four months before Lowe received orders and provisions to construct four (eventually seven) balloons equipped with mobile hydrogen gas generators. At {{the same time he}} assembled a band of men whom he would instruct in the methodology of military ballooning. The newly formed Union Army Balloon Corps remained a civilian contract organization, never receiving military commissions, a dangerous position lest any one of the men be captured as spies and summarily executed.|$|E
25|$|When she <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States she {{submitted}} a very thorough and insightful report to Congress. One of her recommendations was that Congress should {{create a new}} State Department Bureau for African Affairs to be overseen by a new {{assistant secretary of state}} for African affairs. Bolton helped to see that this did in fact happen, and Congress created the new bureau in 1958. In addition to sharing information about her trip with Congress through her official report, Bolton also made an impressive effort to enlighten the American people about the diversity of the African continent by creating a film about her trip, entitled Africa: Giant With a Future, 1955. This film is an excellent resource for students and instructors wanting a look at several African countries/colonies in the mid-1950s, and has been made available on DVD by the National Archives. In addition to educating Congress and the general public about Africa, Bolton's trip helped to begin the process of opening doors for women to play a major role in US foreign relations.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, {{only two}} non-Cup Series regulars won a race during the 35-race schedule: David Gilliland and Paul Menard. Menard and Johnny Sauter {{were the only}} Busch Series regulars to finish in the top-10 in points that season. In 2007, only three Busch drivers scored a victory: Aric Almirola, Stephen Leicht and Jason Leffler. Almirola's victory at the Milwaukee Mile on June 23 was {{controversial}} and unusual, as Almirola was pulled from his pole-winning car after leading 42 of the first 58 laps {{to make room for}} Cup regular Denny Hamlin, due to obligations with sponsor Rockwell Automation which is headquartered in Milwaukee. Hamlin was scheduled to compete in a Cup event at Infineon Raceway the same weekend, and had several delays in his trek from California to Wisconsin. Despite the loss in track position due to the driver change, Hamlin <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front to take the checkered flag after 250 laps. Almirola was officially credited with the win because he made the start, but did not participate in victory celebrations.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Purser {{helped the}} Hawks {{return to the}} finals {{following}} a successful {{second half of the}} season where they won nine of their final 13 games. After missing out on the finals in 2014, the Hawks <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> post-season only just with a 12–14 record to finish in eighth position. That set up a clash with the Joondalup Wolves in the quarter-finals, where the Hawks almost pulled off what would have been a remarkable upset. Perry Lakes won Game 2 in a two-point thriller after losing Game 1 by a solitary point, before going on to lose the series with a 109–100 defeat in Game 3. On 4 July 2015, in his 200th SBL game, Purser had a season-best outing with 29 points, 14 boards, four assists and four steals in a 104–102 overtime win over the Goldfields Giants in Kalgoorlie. Purser appeared in all 29 games for the Hawks in 2015, averaging 18.1 points, a career-high 9.4 rebounds and 4.3 assists per game. Throughout the season, he recorded a career-high 12 double-doubles.|$|E

He lauded his players for their effort nonetheless, saying: [...] "..we've won an All-Ireland, and <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final. I think that's a phenomenal achievement." [...] He added that he was confident Armagh would win another title in the future. Of the match itself, Kernan said: [...] "I think if Steven McDonnell had got that goal towards the end, even with the man down I {{think we would have}} won the game. Big matches hinge on certain things {{and that was one of}} them." [...] McDonnell applauded Conor Gormley's tackle which prevented him from scoring: [...] "...I'd say it was one of the best tackles ever." ...|$|E
500|$|After the race, Simpson {{prepared}} for the world road championships with distance training and criteriums. At the world championships on 3 September, the [...] road race consisted of twenty-four laps of a varying circuit at Sallanches in the French Alps. Simpson crashed on the third lap while descending in wet conditions, damaging a pedal. He <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> peloton, launching a solo attack on a descent; he then chased down the group of four leaders with two laps to go. On the last lap he was dropped by three riders, finishing six seconds behind. On 17 October, Simpson rode in the Giro di Lombardia. Halfway through the race {{he was given the}} wrong musette (bag) by his team in the feed zone, and threw it away. With the head of the race reduced to five riders, Molteni's Gianni Motta attacked. Simpson {{was the only one who}} could follow, but he began to feel the effects of not eating. Motta gave him part of his food, which sustained him for a while. On the final climb Simpson led Motta, but was exhausted. Over the remaining [...] of flat terrain, Motta dropped him; Simpson cracked, and was repeatedly overtaken, finishing twenty-first. He closed the year riding track races.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to Manchester Central railway station, where she waited outside in the car while he {{selected}} their victim. After a few minutes Brady reappeared {{in the company of}} Edward Evans, to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister. After they had driven back home and relaxed over a bottle of wine, Brady sent Hindley to fetch her brother-in-law. When they <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house Hindley told Smith to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light. When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for [...] "the miniature wine bottles". Brady led Smith into the kitchen and left him there, saying {{that he was going to}} collect the wine. A few minutes later, Smith heard a scream, followed by Hindley shouting loudly for him to come and help. Smith entered the living room to find Brady repeatedly striking Evans with the flat of an axe, and watched as he then throttled Evans with a length of electrical cord. Evans's body was too heavy for Smith to carry to the car on his own—Brady had sprained his ankle in the struggle—so they wrapped it in plastic sheeting and put it in the spare bedroom.|$|E

Arnaud Démare crashed on the climb, but was able to reach the field again as it <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attacking group {{at the bottom of}} the Poggio. [...] set the pace up the final climb, but Michał Kwiatkowski broke clear [...] from the finish. Vincenzo Nibali chased after him on the descent and the group of favourites came back together at the run-in to the finish, after Fabian Cancellara had put in an attack, marked by Matteo Trentin (...) [...] At the [...] mark, Edvald Boasson Hagen started one last attack, but to no avail as the group approached the finish together. Shortly before the line, a touch of wheels led to a crash by Fernando Gaviria (...) , which caused several riders to lose momentum, including Peter Sagan. In the following mass sprint, Arnaud Démare came out on top and won his first ever cycling monument, ahead of Ben Swift and Jürgen Roelandts (...) [...] Démare was the first Frenchman to win Milan–San Remo since Laurent Jalabert in 1995, and the first Frenchman to win a monument race since Jalabert's victory in the 1997 Giro di Lombardia.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} also subject to less {{favorable}} reviews from critics who were {{disappointed with the}} gaps in Michael and Walt's story. Steve Heisler of Time Out [...] "wasn't all-too-pleased", citing the story's predictability. TMZ's Daniel called [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] "solid, but not spectacular" [...] {{and gave it a}} grade of a [...] "C+", writing that [...] "this episode fell a little short … I feel like we were kind of robbed of half of the 'What Happened to Michael?' story. It was interesting to see how far into depression he sunk … And they did give him a pretty good reason for working for Ben … But I can't shake the feeling that we missed a good opportunity". He further commented that [...] "Tom would make a great football coach—his motivational speeches are awesome." [...] TV Squad's Erin Martell was unsatisfied with Michael's flashback and the lack of Walt, asking [...] "What was their cover story when they <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mainland? … they couldn't do a genuine flashback scene because of … Kelley's growth spurt, but they could have worked around that." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV ranked it as the second worst episode of the season; his colleague John Kubicek was also critical, and commented that the flashback [...] "essentially tells us things we already know without telling us much more." ...|$|E
500|$|Rejewski studied these related {{pairs of}} letters. For example, {{if there were}} four {{messages}} that had the following indicators on the same day: BJGTDN, LIFBAB, ETULZR, TFREII, then {{by looking at the}} first and fourth letters of each set, he knew that certain pairs of letters were related. B was related to T, L was related to B, E was related to L, and T was related to E: (B,T), (L,B), (E,L), and (T,E). If he had enough different messages to work with, he could build entire sequences of relationships: the letter B was related to T, which was related to E, which was related to L, which was related to B (see diagram). This was a [...] "cycle of 4", since it took four jumps until it <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> start letter. Another cycle on the same day might be AFWA, or a [...] "cycle of 3". If there were enough messages on a given day, all the letters of the alphabet might be covered by a number of different cycles of various sizes. The cycles would be consistent for one day, and then would change to a different set of cycles the next day. Similar analysis could be done on the 2nd and 5th letters, and the 3rd and 6th, identifying the cycles in each case and the number of steps in each cycle.|$|E

In stage nineteen, the general classification leaders descended the wet roads of the unclassified penultimate climb {{at the head of the}} race, with only Costa surviving from the breakaway. Romain Bardet attacked after a series of crashes that included Froome and Mollema.

500|$|... withdrew its {{sponsorship}} of the Gitane team for the 1963 season. Simpson was contracted to their manager, Raymond Louviot; Louviot was rejoining St. Raphaël-Gitane-Geminiani and Simpson could follow, but he saw that as a step backwards. [...] bought the contract from Louviot, which ran {{until the end of}} the season. Simpson's season opened with Paris–Nice; he fell out of contention after a series of tyre punctures in the opening stages, using the rest of the race as training. He withdrew from the race on the final stage to rest for his next race, Milan–San Remo; after breaking away by himself he stopped beside the road, which annoyed his fellow riders. At Milan–San Remo, Simpson was in a four-rider breakaway; his tyre punctured, and although he <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front, he finished nineteenth. He placed third in the Tour of Flanders in a three-rider sprint. In Paris–Roubaix Simpson worked for teammate, and winner, Emile Daems, finishing ninth. In the one-day Paris–Brussels he was in a breakaway near the Belgian border; with [...] remaining he was left with world road race champion Jean Stablinski of St. Raphaël-Gitane-Geminiani, who attacked on a cobbled climb in Alsemberg outside Brussels. Simpson's bike slipped a gear, and Stablinski stayed away for the victory. After his second-place finish, Simpson led the Super Prestige Pernod International season-long competition for world's best cyclist. The following week he raced in the Ardennes classics, placing thirty-third in Liège–Bastogne–Liège, after he rode alone for about [...] before being caught in the closing kilometres.|$|E
