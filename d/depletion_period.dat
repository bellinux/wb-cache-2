These levels were reduced by 61 % within 14 days after zinc supplementation was terminated. Incubation of rat [35 S]metallothionein with human erythrocyte lysate showed a time-dependent increase in 35 S soluble in 20 % trichloroacetic acid, indicating degradation of the labeled protein, presumably via protease activity in the lysate. It is proposed that zinc supplementation induces erythrocyte metallothionein during erythropoiesis and that low zinc intake decreases synthesis and/or accelerates degradation of the protein in reticulocytes/erythrocytes.

Several ozone depletion events and concurrent decreases in hydrocarbon concentrations relative to their background levels were observed at Alert and Narwhal ice camp. At Narwhal, a long period (≥ 7 days) of ozone depletion was observed during which a clear decay of alkane concentration occurred. A kinetic analysis led to a calculated Cl atom concentration of 4. 5 × 10 ³ cm⁻³ during this period. Several low-ozone periods concurrent with NMHC concentration decreases were observed over a widespread region of the Arctic region (82 °– 85 °N, and 51 °– 65 °W).

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the dominance of one species with respect to others is a pertinent challenge in HAB growth dynamics studies and the nutrient supply mode {{is one of the}} factors potentially involved. The competition for phosphorus (P) between a toxic species, Alexandrium minutum, and a non-toxic species, Heterocapsa triquetra, was studied (1) along a gradient of P depletion, (2) testing different P depletion degrees before a single PO 4 supply and (3) experimenting different PO 4 supply frequencies. In conditions of PO 4 depletion, H. triquetra stopped growing after two days both in monospecific and mixed batch cultures whereas A. minutum grew progressively from day 2 {{until the end of the}} experiment. This time-lag growth of A. minutum is associated to its ability to store P intracellularly and then mobilize it for cell division when P depletion becomes severe. Heterocapsa triquetra outcompeted A. minutum when it was submitted to less than three days of P depletion before the pulse. In contrast, A. minutum outcompeted H. triquetra after more than three days of depletion. This transition was related to the capacity for A. minutum to increase its cell PO 4 uptake rate in a higher proportion to face potential PO 4 supply. As a result of this physiological acclimatation to P starvation, A. minutum consumed the whole PO 4 pulse supplied after 3 to 10 days of P depletion. This resulted in a reduction of H. triquetra growth. These two acclimatations were confirmed in a P limited semi-continuous culture experiment testing several PO 4 supply frequencies (1, 2, 4, 6 day intervals). These experiments revealed that A. minutum is a “storage specialist ” species for P, which uptakes PO 4 pulses for luxury consumption, survives <b>depletion</b> <b>periods</b> and, then, utilizes P for cell growth.

40|$|The springtime episodic {{depletion}} of tropospheric ozone and gaseous elemental mercury in the Arctic {{has been a}} focus of intense research over recent years. It has been generally accepted that bromine is the primary driver of Arctic ozone depletion events (ODEs) through a photochemical reaction mechanism catalyzed by Br atoms. Due to the very close correlation between ODEs and atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) it has been proposed that reactive bromine species (i. e., Br and/or BrO) are the dominant reaction partners for gaseous elemental mercury. The source of the reactive bromine to the Arctic boundary layer {{is believed to be}} the saline snow and ice surfaces that are ubiquitous in the Arctic marine environment, however, the specific source and production mechanism of these species remain unknown. Ground-based and satellite observations of BrO in the Arctic have confirmed the presence of reactive bromine chemistry during polar spring. However, there remains significant debate regarding the importance of reactive chlorine on ODEs and AMDEs, as well as on the impact of chlorine on important tropospheric chemical cycles. This gap in our understanding of Arctic chemistry is due in part to a lack of analytical techniques suitable for detecting the very low concentrations of ClO radical species present in the Arctic boundary layer. ^ This work describes a new method developed for the in-situ chemical detection of BrO and ClO radicals in ambient Arctic air using a dynamic chemical reaction system coupled to a gas chromatograph with electron capture detection. This method was used during the Ocean-Atmosphere-Sea Ice-Snowpack (OASIS) 2009 field campaign in Barrow, Alaska for the detection and quantification of ClO radicals. This data, along with the suite of measurements from the OASIS study, was used to analyze the role of reactive chlorine in ODEs and AMDEs by both kinetic analysis and computer model simulations. Additionally, modeling studies were performed to investigate the interactions of the bromine, chlorine, and iodine radical species during ozone <b>depletion</b> <b>periods.</b> Finally, this work discusses the development and testing of a mobile, sled-based version of the chemical reaction method for determining halogen levels directly over the sea ice in an effort to gain a better understanding of the sources of halogen species to the Arctic polar boundary layer. ...|$|R

This case contains all stages of the general model, as shown in Fig.  5, {{where there is a}} significant <b>Depletion</b> <b>period</b> before the eventual failure of the enterohepatic cycle leads to the onset of Metabolic Deficiency. The total vitamin B 12 falls, but HoloTC, MMA and tHcy remain normal, during the <b>Depletion</b> <b>period.</b> When the liver store of HoloHC is consumed, Metabolic Deficiency commences, with the HoloTC concentration falling and the MMA and tHcy increasing. This case applies where the failure is outside of the HoloTC feedback control loop (Fig.  4), for example when the vitamin B 12 deficiency is caused by reduction in intake, or reduction in the utilization of the vitamin B 12 in the cells because of a defect in the intracellular cobalamin metabolism. Another, very common, example of this case is food-cobalamin malabsorption where vitamin B 12 bound to food protein cannot be released because of hypochlorhydria due to gastric atrophy (Carmel 1995; Andrès et al. 2004). This common cause of vitamin B 12 deficiency in the elderly {{is not the same as}} pernicious anaemia because production of intrinsic factor is not affected; the patient is able to absorb unbound vitamin B 12. Examples of such cases consistent with this alternative model, where vitamin B 12 deficiency was likely to be caused by gradual loss of gastric acid production, were those whose subjects were elderly (Miller et al. 2006; Clarke et al. 2007; Schrempf et al. 2011; Palacios et al. 2013; Remacha et al. 2014).|$|E

Striatal PP 1 activity is partially inhibited by a fragment of the PP 1 -binding protein neurabin-I, Nb-(146 – 493), because of the selective inhibition of the PP 1 γ 1 isoform. The fraction of PP 1 activity that is insensitive to Nb-(146 – 493) was unaffected by dopamine depletion, demonstrating that dopamine depletion specifically reduces the activity of PP 1 isoforms that are sensitive to Nb-(146 – 493) (i. e. PP 1 γ 1). However, total striatal levels of PP 1 γ 1 or any other PP 1 isoform were unaffected by dopamine depletion, and our previous studies showed that total levels of the PP 1 regulatory/targeting proteins DARPP- 32, spinophilin, and neurabin were also unchanged. Rather, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that dopamine depletion increases the association of PP 1 γ 1 with spinophilin in striatal extracts.

Simultaneously,the Fe oxide-rich layer from flood deposition prevents (or at least limits) phosphorus release intoporewater {{as shown by the}} increasing P/Fe ratio of the ascorbate extractions. During spring and summer, Fe oxidesare reductively dissolved until complete <b>depletion</b> results. This <b>period</b> also corresponds to the saturation ofFe oxides by phosphorus and probably maximum P release to the water column. The site located closer to theshore showed higher density of benthic faunas leading to more intense bioirrigation. The importance of bioturbationon the year scale for biogeochemical processes is discussed according to both bioirrigation and biomixingprocesses...|$|R
40|$|The study {{evaluated}} the iron bioavailability and utilization in rats fed cassava-based complementary diets. Bioavailability and utilization were determined in Sprague-Dawley rats using the iron balance and hemoglobin depletion-repletion methods in a 6 x 8 randomized block design. Rats were depleted by feeding them a low iron casein diet for 14 days. During the repletion period, the rats were fed four composite diets formulated using iron improved cassava varieties {{as the base}} ingredients. Hemoglobin was determined {{at the end of}} <b>depletion</b> and repletion <b>periods.</b> Iron bioavailability expressed as hemoglobin regeneration efficiency (HRE) was higher in the rats that consumed the positive control diet than in those fed test (improved with iron) diets. The present study also found an inverse correlation between diet iron content and bioavailability (r = - 0. 88, P 12 g/dl) except for rat fed the negative control suggesting that iron was poorly utilized. The study confirmed that the overall iron bioavailability expressed as hemoglobin regeneration efficiency (HRE) from composite flour formulated from cassava is low. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} simultaneous {{measurements of}} stratospheric ClONO 2, HNO 3, temperature, and aerosol extinction coefficient by the Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer (CLAES) on the NASA Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), obtained {{over the period}} 9 January 1992 through 23 April 1993. The discussion concentrates on the stratosphere region near 21 km {{of particular interest to}} heterogeneously driven ozone <b>depletion.</b> For <b>periods</b> between 12 June and 1 September 1992 at latitudes poleward of about 60 deg S, when temperatures were below type I polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) formation thresholds throughout the lower stratosphere, CLAES observed high levels of PSCs coincident with highly depleted fields of both HNO 3 and ClONO 2. By 17 September, the incidence of PSCs had greatly diminished in the lower stratosphere, but both CLONO 2 and HNO 3 remained highly depleted. These observations are consistent with the removal of gaseous HNO 3 through the formation of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) particles and the removal of ClONO 2 through heterogeneous reactions on the particle surfaces. They also suggest substantial denitrification of the lower Antarctic vortex through sedimentation of PSC particles. In the Northern Hemisphere winter of 1992 / 93 far fewer PSCs were observed in the Arctic lower-stratosphere vortex, which had shorter periods and more localized regions of cold temperatures. Both HNO 3 and ClONO 2 maintained much higher levels inside the Arctic vortex than seen in the Antarctic throughout the winter/spring period. Following 28 February 1993 when Arctic vortex temperatures rose above 195 K, ClONO 2 was observed in large quantities (greater than 2. 1 ppbv near 21 km) inside the vortex. The persistence of relatively high levels of HNO 3 inside the Arctic spring vortex compared with the low levels seen in the Antarctic spring vortex suggest a much lower level of denitrification in the Arctic...|$|R
40|$|Pairs of littermate, {{primiparous}} sows {{were fed}} a low folic acid, basal diet for 98 days to minimize body folic acid (FA) stores. Following the <b>depletion</b> <b>period,</b> sows were synchronized and bred via artificial insemination.

Experimental diets {{consisted of the}} low folic acid, basal diet supplemented with either 0 or 8 mg of FA per sow per day. The FA supplementation elevated sow serum FA concentration during pregnancy but did not alter immunoglobulin concentration in sow serum, piglet serum nor sow colostral whey at parturition.

The FA supplementation of the gravid sow did not alter piglet thymus or spleen weight, DNA, or protein content at birth, but resulted in a lower (...|$|E
30|$|Well {{completion}} and specification parameters for oil wells are mentioned in Table  2. This is base scenario for these wells. The well oil production limits are set at 20, 000 STB/day {{as shown in}} Table  3. The maximum gas to oil ratio for scenario 1 {{was found to be}} 1.21 MSCF/STB. It is obvious from Fig.  1, that the injection of gas raises the sector’s reservoirs pressure by 400 psia in 2016, as compared to reservoir pressure of natural <b>depletion</b> <b>period</b> and this pressure further sustains till 2019 and additional oil is recovered. Higher injection rates cause higher average sector pressures. The oil production from these wells lasted from 2010 to 2019 as shown in Fig.  2. From Fig.  2, it is obvious that reservoir’s life extends by 2  years and improved oil recovery produces an additional 1.23  M tonnes at the end of oil recovery period.|$|E
40|$|A {{subclinical}} vitamin K deficiency was induced in 32 healthy subjects (four {{groups of}} eight males and females) aged 20 - 40 and 60 - 80 yr {{residing in the}} Metabolic Research Unit of the Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts Univer-sity. Volunteers were initially fed (4 d) a baseline-period diet containing the recommended daily allowance for vitamin K which is equivalent to 80;tg/d of phylloquinone (vitamin K 1). During the baseline period various parameters of vitamin K nutritional status were monitored. The baseline period was fol-lowed by a 13 -d <b>depletion</b> <b>period</b> during which the subjects were fed a very low vitamin K 1 diet (- 10;ug/d). After depletion, the subjects entered a 16 -d repletion period (four stages lasting 4 d each) during which time they were repleted with 5, 15, 25, and 45,ug of vitamin K 1 per day.

30|$|The detrended TEC map at 05 : 50 UT in Fig. 2 (a), {{about four}} {{minutes after the}} {{earthquake}} onset, indicates that any remarkable TEC variations were not observed over Japan. At 05 : 55 UT in Fig. 2 (b), enhancements of the detrended TEC were observed {{in the vicinity of}} the epicenter. It is noted that the trend of the vertical TEC obtained with a 10 -minute running average decreases (increases) within five minutes before the sudden depletion (enhancement) in the vertical TEC. The detrended TEC derived by subtracting this trend from the vertical TEC could show a virtual enhancement (<b>depletion)</b> during this <b>period.</b> Considering the time sequence of the vertical TEC in Fig. 1 (a) and the characteristics of this detrended technique, the enhancements of the detrended TEC would correspond to the sudden depletions in the vertical TEC. The center of these enhancements (represented by cross marks in Fig. 2) was estimated to be around 37.5 °N of latitude and 144.0 °E of longitude. We termed this center the “ionospheric epicenter”. The ionospheric epicenter was about 170 km distance from the epicenter in the southeast direction.|$|R
30|$|The log-log graphs in Figure 1 include {{lines with}} a slope of − 0.5 that {{indicate}} periods during the experiments when leaching {{can be assumed}} to be mainly controlled by diffusion. Diffusion-controlled processes {{are expected to be}} proportional to the square root of time (i.e. exponent 0.5). This exponent becomes factor 0.5 in logarithmic functions of cumulative emissions and − 0.5 in logarithmic functions of emission rates with time. During the early stage of the experiments, the emission curves of all components follow the lines with a slope of − 0.5 almost parallel, i.e. leaching is mainly controlled by diffusion. Steeper graphs indicate <b>depletion</b> after longer <b>periods</b> of permanent immersion. The applied TS- 2 sampling scheme includes a short immersion step from the 14 th to the 15 th day. This caused relatively high emission rates for tebuconazole during this immersion period (see Figure 1 a), but not for Cu, DOC and TN. For tebuconazole and copper, these observations are in agreement with former experiments [9],[11]. It is assumed that leaching of tebuconazole is restricted due to its low water solubility (29 mg/l at 20 °C, independent of pH [19]). Providing fresh water strongly supports leaching of this substance.|$|R
40|$|Drastic {{groundwater}} {{resource depletion}} due to excessive extraction for irrigation {{is a major}} concern in many parts of India. In this study, an attempt was made to simulate the groundwater scenario of the catchment using ArcSWAT. Due to the restriction on the maximum initial storage, the deep aquifer component in ArcSWAT was found to be insufficient to represent the excessive groundwater depletion scenario. Hence, a separate water balance model was used for simulating the deep aquifer water table. This approach is demonstrated through a case study for the Malaprabha catchment in India. Multi-site rainfall data was used to represent the spatial variation in the catchment climatology. Model parameters were calibrated using observed monthly stream flow data. Groundwater table simulation was validated using the qualitative information available from the field. The stream flow was found to be well simulated in the model. The simulated groundwater table fluctuation is also matching reasonably well with the field observations. From the model simulations, deep aquifer water table fluctuation was found very severe in the semi-arid lower parts of the catchment, with some areas showing around 60 m <b>depletion</b> over a <b>period</b> of eight years.
