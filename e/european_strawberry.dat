50|$|Fragaria vesca, {{commonly}} called wild strawberry, woodland strawberry, Alpine strawberry, Carpathian Strawberry, <b>European</b> <b>strawberry,</b> or fraisier des bois, is a perennial herbaceous {{plant in the}} rose family that grows naturally {{throughout much of the}} Northern Hemisphere, and that produces edible fruits.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} of strawberries {{is a long}} story that starts with the selection and cultivation of <b>European</b> <b>strawberry</b> species in western Europe in the 15th century while a similar discovery and cultivation occurred in Chile. The most commonly consumed strawberry species in modern times is the garden strawberry, a species derived from hybridization of two other species, with the scientific name Fragaria × ananassa, {{but there are many}} species of strawberries, several others of which are cultivated to some extent. The strawberry species fall into several different genetic types, based on their number of chromosomes. Strawberry growers have employed many breeding techniques, starting with traditional plant breeding and then moving on to molecular breeding and genetic engineering in the 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|In 1752 {{the house}} was bought by Admiral Lord Anson, who {{commissioned}} Capability Brown to remake the formal gardens in sweeping [...] "landscape style" [...] with a small lake. Horace Walpole was not impressed: [...] "I was not much struck with it, after all the miracles I had heard Brown had performed there. He has undulated the horizon in so many artificial molehills, that it is full as unnatural {{as if it was}} drawn with a rule and compasses." [...] Further owners succeeded at regular intervals until the enlarged estate was sold to the Robert Grosvenor, 1st Baron Ebury in 1828. Earl Grosvenor, son of the Duke of Westminster, built the gateway at Batchworth Heath and planted the pleasure grounds with trees and ornamental shrubs. It is said that the commercial strawberry, a hybrid of the <b>European</b> <b>strawberry</b> and a Chilean species, was first cultivated in the kitchen gardens of Moor Park, as had been the [...] "Moorpark" [...] fuzzless apricot in an earlier day.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} the physicochemical characteristics and antioxidant activity of 13 commercial honeys from diverse floral origin, produced in Portugal. The values of electrical conductivity of cardoon and pennyroyal honeys were {{superior to the}} maximum limits defined by <b>European</b> legislation. Citrus, <b>strawberry</b> tree, and 1 sample of lavender honeys had values of diastase activity below those determined by <b>European</b> legislation. <b>Strawberry</b> tree, pennyroyal, and cardoon honeys had the highest amounts of potassium that coincided with the highest electrical conductivity. Strawberry tree honey was the most effective as antioxidant along with cardoon and heather honeys. This ability was strongly correlated with the amounts of phenols and flavonoids and not with the levels of vitamin C or proline...|$|R
40|$|Background: Globally, high {{amounts of}} food are wasted due to {{insufficient}} quality and decay. Although pollination {{has been shown}} to increase crop quality, a possible impact on shelf life has not been quantitatively studied. Results: We tested how shelf life, represented by fruit decay, firmness and weight, changes as a function of pollination limitation in two <b>European,</b> commercially important <b>strawberry</b> varieties. Pollination limitation resulted in lower amounts of deformed fruits. Whereas 65 % of wind-pollinated fruits were deformed, open pollination resulted in only 20 % deformed fruits. During storage, the proportion of decayed fruits increased in relation to the degree of deformation. In the variety Yamaska, 80 % of the fruits with high degrees of deformation decayed after four days, whereas in the variety Sonata, all highly deformed fruits had already decayed after three days. Fruit weight decreased independent from the degree of deformation. However, strongest deformations resulted in a generally lower fruit weight in Sonata, whereas in Yamaska, also medium deformed fruits had a lower weight than highly deformed fruits. Effects of deformation on firmness declines were mostly variety dependent. Whereas firmness declined similarly for all degrees of deformation for Yamaska, highly deformed fruits lost firmness fastest in Sonata. Conclusions: Our results suggest that crop pollination has the potential to reduce food loss and waste in pollinated crops and thus to contribute to global food security. However, this relationship between pollination and food waste has so far been almost completely ignored. Future pollination research should therefore focus not only on yield effects but also on crop quality. A more comprehensive understanding of how pollination can benefit global food security should lead to a more efficient crop production to help meeting future food demands...|$|R
40|$|Sicilian {{strawberry}} production {{plays an}} important role in <b>European</b> <b>strawberry</b> industry, due to early production (February to April) and high market value. In Sicily planting takes place from August to October, depending on cultivation method and cultivar. Plug plants (tip plants) and fresh-dug plants from high elevation nurseries are the preferred plant materials due to early fruiting potential. However, optimal planting dates must be determined for the various commercial strawberry varieties in order to maximize fruit production. We planted four cultivars, ‘Camarosa’, ‘Candonga’, ‘Tudla’, ‘Naiad’, and a selection, MT 99. 163. 22 - Kilo’ (MT 91. 143. 5 x Chandler) on September 25 th and October 10 th 2006. Early-season and total yield were greatest for plug plants established in late September as plants were able to achieve adequate growth before the cold winter season...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{project is}} based on {{research}} on pheromones and the project SoftPest Multitrap. Copenhagen Universitys Science and Life Sciences, more specifically Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, has researched and developed the pheromonis for mass trapping of the Strawberry Blossom Weevil (Anthonomus Rubi) and the European Tarnished Plant Bug (Lygus Rugulipennis). Our foucus is on the user-experience Associated with the pheromonibased traps. Especially the distrubution, assembly, setup, Collection, cleaning, storage and The Problem The Strawberry Blossom Weevil and European Tarnished Plant Bug are a major problem to <b>European</b> <b>strawberry</b> producers and reduces the annual yield remarkably. The conventional strawberry producers can efficiently spray with pesticides to control the pest, however, this is harmful to the environment. The ecological strawberry producers lack effective pest control methods and has no options if they are attacked by the mentioned pest. A preromone-based pest control method is a promising alternative and it is useful for both conventional and ecological strawberry producers. However, a userdriven redesign of SoftPest Multitrap (figure 1) is nescessary. This {{is to ensure that}} the traps can be easily implemented in the various production methods and be a competitive alternative to pesticides...|$|E
