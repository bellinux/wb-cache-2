2500|$|In {{science and}} engineering, {{the weight of}} an object is usually taken to be the force on the object due to gravity. Weight is a vector whose {{magnitude}} (a scalar quantity), often denoted by an <b>italic</b> <b>letter</b> W, {{is the product of}} the massm of the object and the magnitude of the local gravitational accelerationg; thus: [...] The unit of measurement for weight is that of force, which in the International System of Units (SI) is the newton. For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons {{on the surface of the}} Earth, and about one-sixth as much on the Moon. In this sense of weight, a body can be weightless only if it is distant (in principle infinitely far away) from any other mass. Although weight and mass are scientifically distinct quantities, the terms are often confused with each other in everyday use (i.e. comparing and converting force weight in pounds to mass in kilograms and vice versa).|$|E

5000|$|There {{is a minor}} {{dispute about}} the proper {{nomenclature}} rules to use for this unusual star system. One side regards the A/B convention of naming binary stars as having priority, so that the pulsar is PSR B1620-26 A, the white dwarf companion is PSR B1620-26 B and the planet is PSR B1620-26 c. The other side considers PSR to apply only to stars which are pulsars, not their companions, so the white dwarf should be named using the WD convention, making the pulsar PSR B1620-26, the white dwarf [...] "WD J1623-266", and the planet [...] "PSR B1620-26 b." [...] Early articles used the first convention, but star catalogs have been using the second. The most recent proposal provides a nomenclature like PSR B1620-26 (AB)b, including capital letters A and B in parentheses to identify inner stellar components of binary system, followed by <b>italic</b> <b>letter</b> b referred to outer planetary companion. In practice, context makes it clear whether the pulsar, the white dwarf, the planet, or {{the system as a}} whole is being referred to.|$|E

50|$|Italics {{describe}} the sloping of letters setting it apart from non-italicized words (or vice versa). Using italics {{on a map}} also slightly decreases {{the size of the}} font as it shapely squeezes it around features. When introduced, the idea was to condense the text by italicizing it, thus creating more text on the pages. The slope in the font was created to mimic the flow of cursive handwriting and thus, the angles of <b>italic</b> <b>letters</b> range anywhere from 11 to 30 degree and consequently, serifs are absent.|$|R

40|$|Complexity theory {{refers to}} the {{asymptotic}} analysis of problems and algorithms. How efficient is an algorithm for a particular optimization problem, {{as the number of}} variables gets large? Are there problems for which no efficient algorithm exists? These are the questions that complexity theory attempts to address. The theory originated in work by Hartmanis and Stearns (1965). By now there is much known about complexity issues in nonlinear optimization. In particular, our recent book Vavasis (1991) contains all the details on many of the results surveyed in this chapter. We begin the discussion with a look at convex problems in the next section. These problems generally have efficient algorithms. In Section 3 we study the complexity of two nonconvex problems that also have efficient algorithms because of special structure. In Section 4, we look into hardness results (proofs of the nonexistence of efficient algorithms) for general nonconvex problems. Finally, in Section 5 we look at recent developments in "approximation" algorithms. We follow the notation in this chapter that lower-case boldface letters are vectors, lower-case <b>italic</b> <b>letters</b> are scalars, and upper-case <b>italic</b> <b>letters</b> are sets or matrices. Superscript T indicates matrix transpose, and aTx indicates inner product. The operators 'less than' and 'greater than' are applied component- wise to vectors; we say x is greater than y if each entry of x is {{greater than or equal to}} the corresponding entry of y...|$|R
