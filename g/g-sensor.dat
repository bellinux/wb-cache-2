40|$|An {{automated}} model-image fitting {{algorithm is}} proposed in this paper for generating façade texture image from pictures taken by smartphones or tablet PCs. The façade texture generation requires tremendous labour work and thus, has been the bottleneck of 3 D photo-realistic city modelling. With advanced developments of the micro electro mechanical system (MEMS), camera, global positioning system (GPS), and gyroscope (<b>G-sensors)</b> can all be integrated into a smartphone or a table PC. These sensors bring the possibility of direct-georeferencing for the pictures taken by smartphones or tablet PCs. Since the accuracy of these sensors cannot compared to the surveying instruments, the image position and orientation derived from these sensors are not capable of photogrammetric measurements. This paper adopted the least-squares model-image fitting (LSMIF) algorithm to iteratively improve the image’s exterior orientation. The image position from GPS and the image orientation from gyroscope are treated as the initial values. By fitting the projection of the wireframe model to the extracted edge pixels on image, the image exterior orientation elements are solved when the optimal fitting achieved. With the exact exterior orientation elements, the wireframe model of the building can be correctly projected on the image and, therefore, the façade texture image can be extracted from the picture...|$|R

50|$|At the 2009 Mobile World Congress, more {{extensive}} changes were revealed. A Calendar tab, featuring month and day views, was introduced. The Stock tab was revised; {{it no longer}} displays graphs, but instead displays the quote and whether it has increased or decreased. The contacts tab was also changed: tapping on a contact displays a subscreen with several new tabs: a contact details tab, and tabs which display text messages, emails, and the call history associated with that contact. The Settings tab has been expanded to include more aspects such as <b>G-sensor</b> and contact card. In addition, a replacement for the Tasks Screen has been devised: all tabs now have an arrangement in landscape format.

Alternatively, in both portrait and landscape modes, a quick swipe left or right can flip tabs one at a time.|$|E
5000|$|To {{control the}} ATTESA E-TS system, {{there is a}} 16-bit {{computer}} that monitors the cars movements 10 times per second to sense traction loss by measuring the speed of each wheel via the ABS sensors. Also a three-axis <b>G-Sensor</b> mounted underneath the center console feeds lateral and longitudinal inputs into a computer, which controls both the ATTESA-ETS AWD system and the ABS system. The computer can then direct up to 50% of the power to the front wheels. When slip is detected {{on one of the}} rear wheels (a rear wheel turn 5% or more than the front wheels), the system directs torque to the front wheels which run a non-limited slip differential. Rather than locking the AWD in all the time or having a system that is [...] "all or nothing", the ATTESA E-TS system can apportion different torque ratios to the front wheels as it sees fit. This provides the driver with an AWD vehicle that performs like a rear wheel drive vehicle in perfect conditions and can recover control when conditions aren't as perfect.|$|E

For most airliners and fighters, the g-sensors are located away from the Center of Gravity (C. G.). Theoretical mechanics shows that, depending on the distance between the <b>g-sensor</b> and the C.

Combining all the information, the adaptive front-lighting system can achieve the real-time control of the pitman arm and yaw angle for automobile headlight system. The feasible control methodology could highly enhance the safety of driving and electronic additional value in automobile industry.

40|$|Many studies {{utilize the}} signal {{strength}} of short-range radio systems (such as WiFi, ultrasound and infrared) {{to build a}} radio map for indoor localization, by deploying {{a large number of}} beacon nodes within a building. The drawback of such an infrastructure-based approach is that the deployment and calibration of the system are costly and labor-intensive. Some prior studies proposed the use of Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) for indoor localization, which does not require the deployment of beacon nodes. In a PDR system, a small number of sensors are put on the pedestrian. These sensors (such as a <b>G-sensor</b> and gyroscope) are used to estimate the distance and direction that a user travels. The effectiveness of a PDR system lies in its success in accurately estimating the user’s moving distance and direction. In this work, we propose a novel waist-mounted based PDR that can measure the user’s step lengths with a high accuracy. We utilize vertical acceleration of the body to calculate the user’s change in height during walking. Based on the Pythagorean Theorem, we can then estimate each step length using this data. Furthermore, we design a map matching algorithm to calibrate the direction errors from the gyro using building floor plans. The results of our experiment show that we can achieve about 98. 26 % accuracy in estimating the user’s walking distance, with an overall location error of about 0. 48 m...|$|E
40|$|Driving {{behavior}} {{is determined by}} individual driving capability features to control particular type of vehicle. These features form particular driving style, which depending on application may be categorized as: aggressive and safe driving, eco and fuel-demanding driving, sober and drowsy driving etc. Nowadays it is useful for transport companies to analyze driving behavior of their employees (or clients), because driving behavior affects vehicle life time, vehicle failure intensity, quality of transport services. Aggressive driving are considered all negative driving features that damage vehicle, increase risk of traffic accident, worsen transport services. In this work a detail driving behavior analysis is performed using inertial measurement sensor – 3 - axis <b>G-sensor</b> (accelerometer) signal information, which is attached to vehicle. There are to objectives of this research: recognition of aggressive and safe driving behavior when signal information is obtained from vehicle that is driven in aggressive and safe driving styles; driving behavior identification (driver classification) when signals are obtained from public transport bus that is driven by two drivers (one at a time). Signal processing analysis is performed and algorithms formed that reduce noise level and detect outliers in signal by combining moving median and average filters. Also a special signal processing is done on public transport bus signals when stopping time must be extracted and deleted from raw signal. This is performed by applying Gaussian mixture models. Algorithms of feature extraction from accelerometer signal are formed using both time and frequency domain information. From time domain the following features are extracted: quantiles of signal; difference between quantiles; correlation between signals; data threshold violation intensity; standard deviation of jerk signal (first order differences of original signal). In the frequency domain relative power spectral density in particular frequency band are extracted as features for various frequency bands. Experimental analysis of aggressive and safe driving classification performance is investigated when four classification algorithms are used: support vector machines, neural networks, random forest and k-nearest neighbor algorithms. Feature selection using filter methods and feature transformation using principal components is perform in order to study whether this could improve classification accuracy. The results of aggressive and safe driving classification show that using 10 sorted features ~ 95 % accuracy is achieved (that is greater than using all features) and using only 4 features extracted from X axis only ~ 91. 5 % accuracy is achieved. When performing public transport driver behavior classification the same all 78 features are extracted from public transport bus accelerometer signals and after feature extraction, a feature selection step is performed again together with driver classification. The results show that when using all 78 features, driving identification accuracy of ~ 79. 4 % is achieved, when using best 20 sorted features accuracy of ~ 79. 2 % is obtained and by using best 7 features, driver identification rate of ~ 77 % is achieved. 6 of all 7 features are extracted from X axis signal alone. After aggressive and safe driving classification and public transport bus driving behavior classification it was noticed that both feature sets roughly match and are alike. So the conclusion is that differences of driving behavior are conditioned by different level of aggressiveness...|$|E
