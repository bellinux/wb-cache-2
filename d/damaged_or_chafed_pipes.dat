5000|$|Investigation {{showed that}} Titan K-17, which was several {{years old and}} the last Titan IV-A to be {{launched}}, had dozens of <b>damaged</b> <b>or</b> <b>chafed</b> wires and {{should never have been}} launched in that operating condition, however the Air Force put extreme pressure on launch crews to meet program deadlines. The ultimate cause of the failure was an electrical short that caused a momentary power dropout to the guidance computer at T+39 seconds. After power was restored, the computer sent a spurious pitch down and yaw to the right command. At T+40 seconds, the Titan was travelling at near supersonic speed and could not handle this action without suffering a structural failure. In any case, the Titan's fuselage was filled with numerous sharp metal protrusions that made it nearly impossible to install, adjust, or remove wiring without it getting damaged. Quality control at Lockheed's Denver plant, where Titan vehicles were assembled, was described as [...] "awful".|$|R

The laboratory test frequently applied to ascertain diagnosis and watch disease and therapy. Common liver function test is AST (aspartat trasnsaminase) and ALT (alanine transaminase) will show if happened <b>damage</b> <b>or</b> <b>chafes</b> at liver network. Mulberry (Morus alba) {{is one of a}} real useful fruit because it’s containing of anthocyanin is having the character as antioxidant and can protect liver cell. The purpose of this research is to know the influence of pigment mulberry (Morus alba) extract as antioxidant to rate SGOT and SGPT at white mouse (Rattus novergicus) what induceed acetaminophen. The type of this research is True Experimental that to planning applied that Completely randomized design (RAL) consists of 6 group of treatment that is: group of A (control negative), Group Of positive B (control), Group Of C (AF + 0, 10 mg/BB), Group Of D (AF + 0, 17 mg/BB), Group Of E (AF + 0, 24 mg/BB), Group Of F (AF + 0, 31 mg/ BB) with 4 times restating. This research done in Laboratorium Kimia Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang on 11 Decembers - 28 Decembers 2007.

50|$|Inexpensive skates for {{recreational}} skaters usually resemble either figure skates or hockey skates, but recreational ice skates resembling inline skates with a molded plastic boot are also available. These recreational skates are commonly rented from ice rinks by beginners {{who do not}} own their own skates. In the non-American English-speaking world they are sometimes called 'death wellies' by skaters who own their own equipment because of their appearance and their reputation for giving the wearer blisters. People who own their own skates may further {{reduce the risk of}} blisters by adding a friction management patch to areas inside the skate that could rub <b>or</b> <b>chafe.</b>|$|R
