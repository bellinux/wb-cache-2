On this basis, a hostile stance is generally taken against the organization. A 1999 government inquiry committee reporting on the financial aspect of cults recommended dissolving the Church of Scientology because of swindling, complicity of swindling, abuse of trust, and other nefarious activities. A government report in 2000 categorized the church as an [...] "absolute cult" [...] and recommended that all its activities be prohibited. The <b>keeping</b> <b>of</b> <b>files</b> containing personal information on all its members (and other practices), are seen to qualify the Church as a totalitarian cult, moreover [...] "extremely dangerous". The report rejected U.S. criticism of the French government's hostility towards Scientology, saying that Washington's protection of cults was [...] "exorbitant".|$|E

40|$|THE ABSTRACT This thesis {{deals with}} the {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>filing</b> legal relations and other data to real estates with recording these legal relations and other data {{in the real estate}} register, included some problems which are in the real estate register incident and incurred while keeping the real estate register's state <b>of</b> <b>filing</b> in accordance with reality. To better realization of a generic context, especially for comprehension of the real estate register principles and recent state <b>of</b> <b>filed</b> data in the real estate register, there is also the historical evolution of registering the real estate in this thesis mentioned. It is difficult to understand some specific problems without knowledge of history because these problems result from former methods of registering the real estate and legal relations to them. Great attention is paid to <b>keeping</b> the state <b>of</b> <b>filing</b> in the real estate register in accordance with reality that is why the illustrations of some particular cases and examples are shown. This was led by effort to connect theoretical principles with their practical use, the major model situations were assumed from the experience of Klatovy Real Estate Register's employees. In the conclusion, an evaluation of the current state <b>of</b> <b>filing</b> in the real estate register is provided and there are some prospects [...] ...|$|R

The LHCb Grid interware LHCbDIRAC is used to make data available to all collaboration members around the world. The data is replicated to the Grid sites in different locations. However the Grid disk storage is limited and does not allow <b>keeping</b> replicas <b>of</b> each <b>file</b> at all sites. Thus it is essential to optimize number of replicas to achieve a better Grid performance. In this study, we present a new approach of data replication and distribution strategy based on data popularity prediction. The popularity is performed based on the data access history and metadata, and uses machine learning techniques and time series analysis methods.

40|$|Layered {{software}} development has demonstrably good reuse properties and offers {{one of the}} few promising approaches to addressing the library scalability problem. In this paper, we show how one can develop layered software using common Unix (Linux/Solaris) dynamic libraries. In particular, we show that, from an object-oriented design standpoint, dynamic libraries are analogous to components in a mixin-based object system. This enables us to use libraries in a layered fashion, mixing and matching different libraries, while ensuring that the result remains consistent. As a proof-of-concept application, we present two libraries implementing file versioning (automatically <b>keeping</b> older versions <b>of</b> <b>files</b> for backup) and application-transparent locking in a Unix system. Both libraries can be used with new, aware applications or completely unaware legacy applications. Further, the libraries are useful both in isolation, and as cooperating units...|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} Timeline {{has been used}} informally in {{spacecraft}} operations software for some time, {{but it has not}} heretofore been formalized and unified either syntactically or semantically. We have formalized and unified the Timeline so that the commonality can be exploited to reduce the cost of developing and using spacecraft operations software. The Timeline can then be used as the common data structure for storage and communications between spacecraft planning and operations software elements. We have formalized linear timelines (both instantaneous events and functions continuous in time) and activities (potentially overlapping set of activities). Most spacecraft planning and operations processes are naturally expressed in terms of software tools that read timelines from databases as input and generate results as new or modified timelines that are written to the databases. Timelines are rigorously versioned, and each version is immutable, thus a versioned timeline name forever represents exactly the same contents. The name is therefore as good as the contents, and the need for <b>keeping</b> <b>files</b> <b>of</b> contents for communicating between programs, or for associating several timelines or even values on those timelines, or for <b>keeping</b> a record <b>of</b> past values, is eliminated. Timelines thus form the syntactic and semantic method of integration of software elements, leading to decreased adaptation cost. Operations efficiency is increased because historically segregated elements are easily integrated so that there are fewer gaps in the operations process that must currently be closed, if they are closed at all, by expensive or inefficient means.
