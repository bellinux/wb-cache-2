60|$|She {{looked at}} him, still without speech. The <b>immobility</b> <b>of</b> {{her face was}} indeed a marvellous thing. Mr. Fentolin's {{expression}} darkened.|$|R

50|$|In {{the current}} era, the <b>immobility</b> <b>of</b> Polaris (the North Star) under the diurnal {{motion of the}} {{celestial}} sphere is a classical illustration of physical invariance.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{relevance}} of the exchange rate regime for stabilization policy. This regime question cannot be dealt with independently of other institutions, in particular how fiscal policy is designed. We show that once fiscal policy is taken into account, the exchange rate regime is irrelevant. This is the case independently of the severity <b>of</b> <b>price</b> rigidities, independently <b>of</b> asymmetries across countries in shocks and transmission mechanisms and regardless of the incompleteness of international financial markets. The only relevant condition is labour mobility. The <b>immobility</b> <b>of</b> labour across countries is a necessary condition for our results. fiscal and monetary policy; fixed exchange rates; labour mobility; monetary union; nominal rigidities; stabilization policy...|$|R

60|$|She did {{not reply}} to that. The <b>immobility</b> <b>of</b> her face, save for the one look she had flashed upon him, {{surprised}} and puzzled him more and more--the world--old, indefinable, eternal feminine quality of the Spring.|$|R
30|$|Contractures {{caused by}} {{compromised}} space in utero {{have a relatively}} late gestational onset and are relatively mild. These types of congenital contractures regress more easily compared to contractures caused by early <b>immobility</b> <b>of</b> the fetus [28].|$|R

30|$|Conclusion The <b>immobility</b> <b>of</b> {{the patient}} and the control of {{movement}} are the major problems of the MRI in pediatric practice as well as the risk of respiratory complication which requires a rigorous care and the most safety environment.|$|R

6000|$|Razumov {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} and stared. [...] "What a tirade!" [...] he thought. The silence and <b>immobility</b> <b>of</b> Councillor Mikulin impressed him. The bearded bureaucrat sat at his post, mysteriously self-possessed like an idol with dim, unreadable eyes. Razumov's voice changed involuntarily.|$|R
60|$|She rose suddenly, and {{sweeping}} across {{the office with}} one graceful movement, she leaned over Wingrave's chair. Her hands rested upon his shoulders, her eyes, soft with gathering tears, pleaded with his. Wingrave sat with all the outward <b>immobility</b> <b>of</b> a Sphinx.|$|R

60|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the fifth day, however, his eye was caught by two women who were gazing up at the cage. It was the <b>immobility</b> <b>of</b> their attitude and the length of time which they continued to gaze at him, which attracted his attention.|$|R
30|$|The {{thickness}} of the soft-tissue layer that remained on the implant surface was reduced {{as much as possible}} without perforating this layer or exposing the implant surface; for this procedure, microsurgical techniques were used in order to achieve <b>immobility</b> <b>of</b> the transplanted keratinized mucosa.|$|R
60|$|She turned aside, {{her face}} {{for the first time}} {{softening}} from the stony <b>immobility</b> <b>of</b> the earlier day, and {{the corners of her mouth}} resuming something of that delicacy of cut which was always lost in her moments of despair. At last she confronted him again.|$|R
60|$|It {{was entirely}} {{impossible}} for Mainwaring {{to conceal his}} astonishment at so unexpected a sight, {{and whether or not}} his own thoughts lent color to his imagination, {{it seemed to him that}} Eleazer Cooper concealed under the <b>immobility</b> <b>of</b> his countenance no small degree of confusion.|$|R
60|$|She {{listened to}} me unreadable, unmoved, narrowed eyes, closed lips, {{slightly}} flushed face, as if carved six thousand years ago in order to fix for ever that something secret and obscure which is in all women. Not the gross <b>immobility</b> <b>of</b> a Sphinx proposing roadside riddles but the finer <b>immobility,</b> almost sacred, <b>of</b> a fateful figure seated at the very source of the passions that have moved men from the dawn of ages.|$|R

6000|$|The {{faint smile}} on her deep-cut lips waned, and her head sank deep into the pillow, taking on the majestic pallor and <b>immobility</b> <b>of</b> marble.

60|$|Nikasti moved a step nearer towards her. Something of the servility of {{his manner}} had gone.

A queer premonition of trouble for a moment unsteadied her.|$|R

Galileo agreed to do so.|$|R
