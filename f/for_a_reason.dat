Olivia visits Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) at Massive Dynamic's headquarters and demands a full list of the subjects, one of which she knows herself to be. Nina claims {{not to have any}} such list.

5|$|On {{the desert}} planet, the search begins for a {{suitable}} source of lime to filter {{the air on}} Destiny. The sand itself has a small concentration of calcite, {{but not enough to}} be useful, so the team starts looking for a dry lake bed, which should have heavy deposits of lime. The group splits into two: Rush, Scott and Ronald Greer (Jamil Walker Smith) form one group, while Wallace leads the remainder in a different direction. After several failed tests, those in Wallace's group give up on the search, instead intending to try out the Stargate addresses the Destiny rejected. When Wallace informs the others, Scott sends Rush and Greer back to stop them while he continues searching. They make it back in time to stop Franklin (Mark Burgess), the member carrying the dialing remote, but the other two make it through. Rush is vehemently against the idea of exploring the other addresses, believing that the ship locked them out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason,</b> and several failed attempts to contact the two lost expedition members seem to support his concerns.|$|E

He is fairly athletic as well, as he is an extremely fast runner and good skateboarder. It is said that Ryang has no problem attracting girls, something that would get him into trouble later on. As for Ryang himself, {{there are more and more}} hints that he is attracted to Fanta.|$|E
25|$|Good {{and evil}} appear {{relative}} in The War of the Worlds, and {{the defeat of}} the Martians has an entirely material cause: the action of microscopic bacteria. An insane clergyman is important in the novel, but his attempts to relate the invasion to Armageddon seem examples of his mental derangement. His death, {{as a result of his}} evangelical outbursts and ravings attracting the attention of the Martians, appears an indictment of his obsolete religious attitudes; but the narrator twice prays to God, and suggests that bacteria may have been divinely allowed to exist on Earth <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> such as this.|$|E
25|$|On December 11, 2006, Kessel's family {{announced}} that he was hospitalized <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> unrelated to hockey. Later during the day, Bob Lobel, a sportscaster for WBZ-TV in Boston, confirmed that Kessel was diagnosed with a form of testicular cancer. Five days later, on December 16, Kessel was announced cancer-free. On January 5, 2007, he was assigned to the Providence Bruins, Boston's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, for conditioning purposes and then recalled on January 7. Kessel returned to the Bruins line-up on January 9, against the Ottawa Senators, after missing only 11 regular season games following cancer surgery.|$|E

25|$|Hayashida {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} NES Remix should be completely authentic to its vintage roots. To this end, the compilation is based entirely on accurate emulation of the NES's hardware and on the original game software. This includes hardware glitches such as frame rate slowdown when too many characters are on the screen, and software bugs. Hayashida stated that these were intricate parts of the original and directly affect the difficulty {{and so they were}} not changed. Hayashida also spoke similarly about the controls; even if they were not considered ideal, he understood that they had been conceived that way <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> and so they were unaltered for NES Remix.|$|E

For comparison, ISO 3696:1987 defines a standard for water used in laboratory analysis; this allows for a contaminant level of ten parts per billion, 4C in homeopathic notation. This water may not be kept in glass as contaminants will leach out into the water.|$|E

Deputy Speakers may resign their office {{in the same way as}} the Speaker, and must vacate their office in the same circumstances.|$|E

25|$|With {{his freedom}} restored, the Doctor chose to {{counteract}} his extended exile by seeking as much non-human company as possible. During this period, the Doctor encountered {{all manner of}} unusual beings – from a species that at cursory glance resembled the Earth tiger (The Year of Intelligent Tigers), to water spirits, to talking apes from another dimension. Though at times the Doctor seemed somewhat cold – as when he seemed more concerned about damaged plums than a dead man (Eater of Wasps) – he retained his passion for life in all forms. Although his amnesia remained a bother, the Doctor acknowledged that whatever {{had happened to him}} had happened <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason,</b> and he might as well make use of the advantages it offered.|$|E
25|$|Along with asking moral questions, Slaughterhouse-Five {{is also a}} {{novel that}} focuses on the philosophies of fate and free will. In the novel, Billy Pilgrim tries to {{determine}} what his role in life is and what the purpose of everything going on around him is as well. When abducted by the Tralfamdorians, Pilgrim asks them why he is chosen among all the others. He questions the fate of the situation and what led up to that point. Billy Pilgrim considers his fate and actions {{to be a part of}} a larger network of actions, his future manipulated by one thing over another based on decision. All things that happen would happen <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason.</b> Indeed, Pilgrim’s beginning mindset would suggest that he believed in free will, fate, whys, decisions and things happening for reasons. However, many of these thoughts are quickly challenged by the Tralfamadorians' ideology.|$|E
25|$|Many {{competitions}} regulations, both amateur and professional, for matches {{of one day}} duration or less, {{modify the}} Law of cricket to mandate a free hit after a No ball is bowled. If the bowler bowls any No ball <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> {{within the scope of}} the competition rule, that ball is treated as usual as a No ball under the Laws, with a penalty run added, and the batsman protected from most forms of dismissal. The next ball is the free hit. The fielders are required to stay in the same positions, and the batsman is again protected from most forms of dismissal under the No ball Law. The free hit may also be ruled a No ball or Wide, in which case the next ball is also a free hit, and so on. Once the bowler has bowled one legitimate 'free hit' ball, one ball is deemed to have been bowled towards the (usually six) legal balls required for one over, which then continues as normal.|$|E

25|$|Elsbeth, her {{page and}} {{the ladies of}} the court are walking in the palace grounds. She {{does not want to}} talk about her future {{marriage}} but of the poor jester whom she so admired. She sends the others away but then discovers Fantasio who amuses her with his banter about the flowers; she is intrigued by the unknown jester. The king, the prince and Marinoni (disguised as each other) enter. Elsbeth is not impressed by the aide-de-camp's song. When she and Fantasio are alone he casts more doubt in her mind about going ahead with the liaison with the prince, and she longs <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to delay the union. The court enter and while Marinoni (as the prince) sings her a pompous song in praise of beauty Fantasio climbs a tree and with a stick lifts the wig from the head of the false prince. The marriage of the Mantuan prince is immediately compromised but Fantasio is taken away.|$|E
25|$|The {{thought that}} the {{mammalian}} body must have some way of identifying introduced foreign particles first arose during World War II. Numerous theories were proposed and it wasn't until 1958 that {{the first of these}} identifying proteins was found. The first standardized naming system was established in 1968 by the WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System. HLA research didn't heat up until the 1980s when a group of researchers finally elucidated the shape of the HLA-A*02 protein (just one of many specific HLA proteins). Even more recently, in 2010, the WHO committee responsible for naming all HLA proteins revised their standards for naming to introduce more clarity and specificity in the naming system. It started with a plane crash in the height of the London Blitz. The pilot suffered severe burns requiring skin grafts. However, at the time skin grafts were a risky business, often being rejected for unknown reasons. The search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> spanned the next four decades and in some areas is still continuing today.|$|E
