25|$|Liriodendron tulipifera is {{generally}} considered to be a shade-intolerant species that is most commonly associated with the first century of forest succession. In Appalachian forests, it is a dominant species during the 50–150 years of succession, but is absent or rare in stands of trees 500 years or older. One particular <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> survived in the grounds of Orlagh College, Dublin for 200 years, before having to be cut down in 1990. On mesic, fertile soils, it often forms pure or nearly pure stands. It can and does persist in older forests when there is sufficient disturbance to generate large enough gaps for regeneration. Individual trees have been known to live for up to around 500 years.|$|E
25|$|Chukwu's incarnations and {{ministers in}} the world (ụ̀wà) are the Alusi, supernatural forces that {{regulate}} human life. In southern Igbo dialects especially, ágbàrà is the term for these forces. The alusi are regarded as channels to Chukwu. The alusi, who are also known as arushi, anusi, or arusi in differing dialects all spring from Ala the earth spirit who embodies {{the workings of the}} world. There are lesser alusi in Odinani, each of whom are responsible for a specific aspect of nature or abstract concept. According to Igbo belief, these lesser alusi, as elements of Chukwu, have their own specific purpose. Alusi manifest in natural elements and their shrines are usually found in forests in which they are based around specific trees. At shrines, íhú mmúọ́, an object such as a hung piece of cloth or a group of statues are placed at an alusi's <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> to focus worship. Deities are described as 'hot' and often capricious so that much of the public approach shrines cautiously and are advised to avoid them at most times, priests are entrusted in the maintenance of most shrines. Many of these shrines are by the roadside in rural areas. Tender palm fronds symbolise spiritual power and are objects of sacralisation, shrines are cordoned off with omu to caution the public of the deities presence. Larger clay modelings in honour of an alusi also exist around forests and rivers. Other alusi figures may be found in and around peoples homes and the shrines of dibia, much of these are related to personal chi, cults, and ancestral worship.|$|E

500|$|Spencer Gore's {{painting}} Richmond Park, {{thought to}} have been painted in the autumn of 1913 or shortly before the artist's death in March 1914, was exhibited at the Paterson and Carfax Gallery in 1920. In 1939 it was exhibited in Warsaw, Helsingfors and Stockholm by the British Council as <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trees.</b> It is now {{in the collection of the}} Tate Gallery under its original title but is not currently on display. [...] The painting is one of a series of landscapes painted in Richmond Park during the last months of Gore's life. According to Tate curator Helena Bonett, Gore's early death from pneumonia, two months before what would have been his 36th birthday, was brought on by his painting outdoors in Richmond Park in the cold and wet winter months. It is not certain where in the park the picture was made but a row of trees close to the pond near Cambrian Gate has a very close resemblance to those in the painting. Another Gore painting, with the same title (Richmond Park), painted in 1914, is at the Ashmolean Museum. His painting Wood in Richmond Park is in the Birmingham Art Gallery's collection.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} {{after the first}} day's shooting, Corbijn told the band about Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia), hardy and twisted plants in the deserts of the American Southwest, and he {{suggested}} their use on the sleeve. Bono was pleased to discover the religious significance of the plant's etymology; according to Mormon legend, early settlers named the plant after the Old Testament prophet Joshua, as the tree's stretching branches reminded them of Joshua raising his hands in prayer. The following day, Bono declared that the album should be titled The Joshua Tree. That morning, while driving on Route 190 near Darwin, they spotted a lone-standing tree in the desert. Corbijn had been {{hoping to find a}} single tree, as he thought it would result in better photographs than if he shot the band amongst a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees.</b> They stopped the bus and photographed with the lone plant for about 20 minutes, something the Edge called [...] "fairly spontaneous". Despite shooting in the desert, the group dealt with cold weather during parts of the trip. Bono explained, [...] "it was freezing and we had to take our coats off so it would at least look like a desert. That's {{one of the reasons we}} look so grim." [...] Regarding the serious tone of the images, Corbijn said, [...] "I guess people felt they took themselves too seriously. It was definitely the most serious, I think, that you can photograph a band. You couldn't go any further down that line unless you start photographing graves." ...|$|E

500|$|The greater noctule bat {{is known}} to {{participate}} in a fission-fusion society. These societies vary in size, but studies show that each society has a social order and a territory in a specific <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> that are used for roosting and breeding. The greater noctule bat has been shown to travel between several roosting sites and to participate in several societies through radio tracking studies. [...] It has been conjectured that ranking in society dictates different roles in society, e.g. some bats are scouts, others are hunters. [...] There has been correlation between a specific bat's social ranking and the size of that bat's potential home range; the higher the social ranking, the lower the home range. The greater noctule bat has an observed active range of 2500km2. {{which is one of the}} largest observed ranges for any bat species. This large area of activity has several effects on the way the greater noctule bat forages and roosts. It has been noted that changes by humans to the natural environment could have had an effect on the way the greater noctule bat travels and roosts in its attempts to find suitable food sources. It has been noted that a lack of roosting sites near food sources could be the reason for the large home range that is displayed by the greater noctule bat. Differences observed between two populations of bats with drastically different habitats, Great Britain and Spain respectively, show that the greater noctule bat would not travel great distances for food unless absolutely necessary. This need to fly great distances for food has been theorized as a reason for the decline of the species. One study reported finding a greater noctule bat on the ground exhausted from flight. Another study of owl droppings found in areas in between GNB roosting sites has shown that the greater noctule bat is susceptible to predation in flight.|$|E

Robert farmed Gourdiehill in Patrick's old age, Alexander took over the German interests; the other three sons emigrated, initially to America. [...] Matthew {{became interested in the}} colonisation of New Zealand and was instrumental in setting up a [...] "Scottish New Zealand Land Company". At his urging, James and Charles Matthew emigrated to New Zealand, where they set up one of the earliest commercial orchards in Australasia using seed and seedlings from Gourdiehill. John Matthew remained in America, sending botanical tree specimens back to his father; these included (in 1853) the first seedlings known to have been planted in Europe of both the Giant Redwood (Sequoiadendron giganteum) and [...] the Coastal Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens). A <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> of these species still thriving near Inchtures in Perthshire comes from these seedlings. [...] Matthew gave many more seedlings to friends, relatives and neighbours, and redwoods can be found throughout the Carse of Gowrie; these as well as some elsewhere in Scotland (e.g. at Gillies Hill near Stirling Castle) are thought to have been grown from the 1853 seedlings.|$|E
2500|$|While {{a member}} of the 2d U.S. Cavalry during the American Indian Wars, he participated in the pursuit of a group of Sioux Indians who had stolen a herd of ponies. On April 1, 1880 the group was located by scouts making camp with the herd at the head of O'Fallon Creek. In what would later be known as the Battle of O'Fallons Creek he was ordered to take ten {{soldiers}} and attempt to capture the complete herd. The soldiers were able to retrieve the herd and cut the Indians off from their horses as well. When the Indian group attempted to get to their horses and escape they were driven away, causing them to separate. In the action one of the Indians was killed and five were captured, while the rest escaped into a nearby <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees.</b> When Brett and his men tried to approach the trees, the Indians, who had lain down on the ground inside the woods, opened fire on the troops. In the battle one soldier {{was shot in the head}} and one horse was hurt and the soldiers' attack had been repelled. While the soldiers considered their next move, the Indians moved into a more defensible position, although completely surrounded. By this point it was getting dark and the soldiers were cold and tired from the day's fighting and they determined it unfeasible to attack. At some point the Indian group escaped from their position without a trace and escaped. For his actions during the battle, Brett received the Medal of Honor, which was presented to him February 7, 1895.|$|E
