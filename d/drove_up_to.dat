5|$|Kehoe <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{the school}} {{about half an}} hour after the explosion. He saw Superintendent Huyck and summoned him over to his truck. Charles Hawson testified at the inquest that he saw the two men {{struggle}} over some type of long gun before Kehoe detonated the dynamite stored in his truck, killing himself, Superintendent Huyck, Nelson McFarren (a retired farmer), and Cleo Clayton, an eight-year-old second grader. Clayton had survived the first blast and had wandered out of the school building debris; he was killed by the fragmentation from the exploding vehicle. The explosion also mortally wounded postmaster Glenn O. Smith, who lost a leg and died later that day of his wounds, and injured several others.|$|E
5|$|New York Police linked rapper Fabolous to {{a crew of}} robbers who {{targeted}} Judah twice. According {{to police}} reports, the Street Fam Crew, the gang that attempted to rob Judah, {{is made up of}} 20members, all former drug dealers from Fabolous' Brooklyn neighborhood. In 2006, three men tried to rob Judah as he stood next to his Lamborghini on West 27th Street at 10th Avenue in New York City. The three men <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Judah in a minivan at about 5am, and came out. One man pulled a handgun on Judah, and told him to put his jewelry on the hood of his car, but Judah ran instead. The muggers followed in their minivan, but crashed into a tree a block away. All three robbers fled the scene, but one was captured by a Homeland Security agent on his way to work, and another was grabbed by a nearby cab driver.|$|E

She identified the Marine as Major Michael Brown and stated that during the assault the major threw her mobile phone into the nearby Tengan River. The woman, later identified with the initials V.N., who was 40 years old, and originally from the Philippines, had lived in Okinawa for 17 years, and was married to a Japanese citizen of Okinawan descent. She reported that she had picked up Brown in her car about 1:30a.m. after the officers' club closed and that he directed her to the deserted road behind the base and after parking, Brown tried to rape her and then threw her mobile phone into the river when she tried to call the police. The Camp Courtney security personnel called the Japanese National Police Agency (NPA). Japanese officers came and took V. N.'s report.|$|E

25|$|Häkkinen again {{remained}} at McLaren for 1997 and Coulthard remained his teammate. Häkkinen's season {{got off to}} a good start: In the season opening race in Australia, he <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the third position and later managed to score further consecutive finishes inside of the points scoring positions in the next three races. He suffered his first retirement of the season at the Monaco Grand Prix when he was involved in a collision with Benetton driver Jean Alesi. Häkkinen later managed to take ninth position at the Spanish Grand Prix, but later suffered three consecutive retirements in the next three races—a collision with Ferrari driver Eddie Irvine in Canada and engine failures in France and Britain.

25|$|In 1991, Rudd won {{his only}} {{race of the}} year at Darlington Raceway. Later in the year at Sonoma, Rudd was the center of {{controversy}} {{in one of the most}} bizarre finishes in NASCAR. Rudd started on pole at the race, and was offered a bonus paycheck with the winning money if he won the race. Rudd <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> second spot with 3 laps left, and when the white flag was waved Rudd tapped Davey Allison to take the lead. When Rudd came back around to the finish line he waved to his pit crew but was shown a black flag for the tap. His win was taken away and given to Allison who refired to end up in second place. Rudd ended up in second place; Rick Hendrick, and crew chief Waddell Wilson unsuccessfully tried to appeal the penalties.|$|E
25|$|Bryant <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{the toll}} booth, {{where there were}} several vehicles, and blocked a BMW owned by Mary Rose Nixon.

Bryant transferred ammunition, handcuffs, the AR-15 rifle and a fuel container to the BMW. Mary Nixon, Russell Pollard, Helene Salzmann and Robert Salzmann are the people Bryant was charged with killing at the toll booth.|$|E

At some stage of the proceedings, they shot and seriously wounded a British soldier who attempted to interfere with them. All available information so far is {{to the effect that}} they were Jews. Somewhere {{in the basement of the}} hotel they planted bombs which went off shortly afterwards. They appear to have made good their escape." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{few days}} before his high school graduation, Bar-Jonah drove to nearby Hartford, Connecticut, and, impersonating a police officer, {{abducted}} a nine-year-old girl, whom he savagely assaulted in the car. After the child began vomiting and convulsing from the assault, he <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a sidewalk and threw the girl out of the car. A nearby witness saw the incident and got his license plate, leading to his arrest. This assault never got back to Bar-Jonah's probation officer, and {{he was released from}} parole in May 1976 for his earlier abduction and sexual assault of an eight-year-old boy. When Bar-Jonah's probationary period was over, he received a letter thanking him for his [...] "cooperation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eleven-year-old Krista Harrison [...] (born May 28, 1971, Orrville, Ohio) {{had been}} picking up {{aluminum}} cans in the Marshallville park {{with one of}} her friends.

Harrison's companion described the abductor's van to have been a brown or dark red color that had round windows on the sides, near the rear. After she was kidnapped, volunteers searched for her body across Marshallville to no avail. It was initially believed that the man would demand ransom for Krista's return, yet no contact was made.|$|E

[...] She lived there several years with her daughters, Mary Banning (1871–1956) and Lucy Banning (1876–1929). The enormous old structure made a charming home, which was cut up into suitable parlors and bedrooms and elegantly furnished, with a fine view. It {{was the scene of}} many social events attended by the first families of the city who <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> it in their carriages.

Simpson explained that he had overslept and would be at the front gate soon. Kaelin opened the Ashford gate to let Park drive the limo onto the estate grounds, and Simpson came out of his house through the front door a few minutes later. Both Kaelin and Park helped Simpson put his belongings (which were already outside the front door when Park <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the front of Simpson's house) into the trunk of the limo for the ride to the airport. Both Kaelin and Park remarked in their testimony that Simpson looked agitated. But other witnesses, including the ticket clerk at Los Angeles International Airport who checked Simpson onto the plane and a flight attendant, said that Simpson looked and acted perfectly normal. Conflicting testimony such as this was to be a recurring theme throughout the trial.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{ignored the}} protests for six months, but on June20,1917, as a Russian {{delegation}} <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the White House, suffragists unfurled a banner which stated: [...] "We women of America {{tell you that}} America is not a democracy. Twentymillion women are {{denied the right to}} vote. President Wilson is the chief opponent of their national enfranchisement". Another banner on August14,1917, referred to [...] "Kaiser Wilson" [...] and compared the plight of the German people with that of American women. With this manner of protest, the women were subject to arrests and many were jailed. Another ongoing tactic of the National Woman's Party was watchfires, which involved burning copies of President Wilson's speeches, often outside the White House or in the nearby Lafayette Park. The Party continued to hold watchfires even as the war began, drawing criticism from the public and even other suffrage groups for being unpatriotic. On October17, Alice Paul was sentenced to seven months and on October30 began a hunger strike, but after a few days prison authorities began to force feed her. After years of opposition, Wilson changed his position in 1918 to advocate women's suffrage as a war measure.|$|E
2500|$|On the 5th Bavarian Division front the {{bombardment}} increased on 14 September, causing many casualties, cutting most telephone lines and destroying the front trenches until an overnight lull. The bombardment resumed {{early in the}} morning including gas shells and before dawn a thick mist rose, which with the gas and smoke, reduced visibility and around [...] troops of Bavarian Infantry Regiment 21 (BIR 21) near Ginchy were surprised to see three vehicles emerge from the mist, manoeuvring round shell-craters. The vehicles, with blue-and-white crosses, were thought to be for transporting wounded. Machine-gun fire was received from them and the Bavarians returned fire but the vehicles <b>drove</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the edge of the trench and fired along it for several minutes. The vehicles drove away, one being hit by a shell and abandoned in no man's land. Soon afterwards a creeping barrage began to move towards the German defences and the German artillery reply was considered by survivors to be feeble. A wounded officer returning for treatment found that the batteries around Flers and Gueuedecourt did not know that the British were attacking because the telephone lines had been cut and visual signals had not been seen in the smoke and mist.|$|E
