60|$|One {{not only}} hears of this favor at home, {{but when one}} goes to England one still hears of it. To be sure one hears of it mainly from Americans, but {{they have the best}} means of knowing the fact; they are chiefly concerned, and they are {{supported}} in their belief by the almost unvaried amenity of the English journals, which now very rarely take the tone towards Americans formerly habitual with them. Their change of tone is the most obvious change which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Americans</b> can count upon noting when they come to England, and I am far from reckoning it insignificant. It did not happen of the newspapers themselves; it must be the expression of a prevalent mood, if not a very deeply rooted feeling in their readers. One hears of their interest, their kindness, not from the Americans alone; the English themselves sometimes profess it, and if they overestimate us, the generous error is in the right direction. At the end it must cease to be an error, for, as we Americans all know, we need only to be better understood in order to be more highly prized. Besides, liking is much oftener the effect of willing than has been supposed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{image of}} {{superior}} quality that Healy strove to promote with his beers received a significant {{start with the}} results of the 1985 Great American Beer Festival, in which Hibernia Dunkel Weizen took second place overall (out of 104 entries) in the Consumer Preference Poll at the competition—trailing only another new beer at the time, Samuel Adams Boston Lager, a contract brew—and Eau Claire All Malt scored first out of 45 beers in the lager competition. [...] Healy expressed justifiable pride in the accomplishment, noting that “there hasn’t been a commercially brewed dark wheat beer in this country in 65 years. It’s the right idea at the right time. … <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>American</b> beer drinkers will discover Americans can make a beer that’s as good as anybody’s in the world if they take the time to do it.” ...|$|R

5000|$|... "Stanny Boy and Frantastic" [...] was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from television critics. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "After a somewhat dull episode last week, American Dad moved back into form with a decent episode about Stan and Francine making friends with a younger couple." [...] However, he would criticize the subplot of the episode, saying {{that the rest of}} the episode was a [...] "distraction". He went on the give the episode a B, the highest grade of the night tying with The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Like a Boss", and Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Sacred Cow", while scoring higher than The Simpsons episode [...] "Homer the Father". Jason Hughes of TV Squad wrote, [...] "I like when a comedy speaks to me on something I can relate to.

The band Dixie Chicks and lead singer Natalie Maines claim that Free Republic was instrumental in fueling a nationwide boycott of their music, which was organized by some former fans and radio stations after Maines made anti-Bush comments in 2003. In their 2006 documentary Shut Up and Sing {{as well as in}} interviews, the Dixie Chicks have often mentioned Free Republic in reference to the boycott, which sharply reduced sales of their CDs and concert tickets.|$|R
5000|$|In a 1998 essay for Mirabella, Burleigh {{described}} an occasion aboard Air Force One {{when she noticed}} President Bill Clinton apparently looking at her legs.

Approached by a Washington Post media reporter to discuss the Mirabella article, Burleigh stated, “I {{would be happy to}} give him a blowjob just to thank him for keeping abortion legal. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>American</b> women should be lining up with their Presidential kneepads on to show their gratitude for keeping the theocracy off our backs.” Referring to the comment in a 2007 piece for The Huffington Post, Burleigh wrote, [...] "I said it (back in 1998, but a good quote has eternal life) because I thought it was high time for someone to tweak the white, middle-aged beltway gang taking Clinton to task for sexual harassment. These men had neither the personal experience nor the credentials to know sexual harassment when they saw it, nor to give a good goddamn about it if they did. The insidious use of sexual harassment laws to bring down a president for his pro-female politics was the context in which I spoke." ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{the above}} {{gives us an}} {{overview}} of what a goal is and what constitute a good goal, we might often find it useful to identify the personal habits which can propel our human performance and thus achievement higher or {{to the next level}} or to achieve the next goal or objective. Next you will find a list of individual personal habits which serve as an expeditor and fine tuner to reach goals. They are not a creation of the writer; rather they are the outcome of what the Scotish and later <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>American</b> great leader of the steel industry, Andrew Carnegie delegated as a project to Attorney Napoleon Hill after considering hundreds of men for the job of writing a philosophy of success which all ordinary men could read. Napoleon Hill wrote many books about it and the next outline is only a summary of the various key habits which he found the many men he interviewed engaged themselves in and carried out during their quest to achieve their success. Sometimes hindsight is 20/20, and the interviews from which Napoleon Hill extracted the habits are in effect what the achievers he interviewed in hinidsight did to reach their goals and objectives.|$|R
5000|$|The 9/11 truth {{movement}} {{became an}} issue in the 2010 Texas Gubernatorial Republican primary when candidate Debra Medina replied when asked by Glenn Beck about US government involvement in the 9/11 attacks: [...] "I think some very good questions have been raised in that regard, there are some very good arguments, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the <b>American</b> people have not seen all of the evidence there, so I have not taken a position on that." [...] After being criticized for the remarks by opposing candidates, Medina said that she has never been a 9/11 truth movement member and believes the twin towers were attacked by Muslim terrorists.|$|R

[...] In early August, Obama said that Snowden was no patriot and that Americans {{would have been better off}} if they had remained unaware of the NSA surveillance activities that Snowden revealed. Obama also said that he had [...] "called for a thorough review of our surveillance operations before Mr. Snowden made these leaks.... My preference, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the <b>American</b> people's preference, would have been for a lawful, orderly examination of these laws; a thoughtful fact-based debate that would then lead us to a better place." ...|$|R

6000|$|I can say conscientiously, {{that were}} {{my life to}} be passed over again, without the hope of {{commanding}} a vessel, it should be passed in the navy. The food is better, the service is lighter, the treatment is better, if a man behave himself at all well, he is better cared for, has a port under his lee in case of accidents, and gets good, steady, wages, with the certainty of being paid. If his ship is lost, his wages are safe; and if he gets hurt, he is pensioned. Then he is pretty certain of having gentlemen over him, {{and that is a}} great deal for any man. He has good quarters below; and if he serve in a ship as large as a frigate, he has a cover over his head, half the time, at least, in bad weather. This is the honest opinion of one who has served in all sorts of crafts, liners, Indiamen, coasters, smugglers, whalers, and transient ships. I have been in a ship of the line, two frigates, three sloops of war, and several smaller craft; and such is the result of all my experience in Uncle Sam's navy. No man can go to sea and always meet with fair-weather, but he will get as little of foul in one of our vessels of war, as in any craft that floats, if a man only behave himself. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the <b>American</b> merchantmen give better wages than {{are to be found in}} other services; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the <b>American</b> men-of-war, as a rule, give better treatment than the American merchantman.

While {{we were looking at}} it, I saw two Americans,--Western men, I should judge,--one of them with a true American slouch, talking to the policeman in attendance, and describing our Senate Chamber in contrast with the House of Lords. The policeman smiled and ah-ed, and seemed to make as courteous and liberal responses as he could. There was quite a mixed company of spectators, and, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> other <b>Americans</b> present besides the above two and ourselves. The Lord Chamberlain's tickets appear to be distributed with great impartiality. There were two or three women of the lower middle class, with children or babies in arms, one of whom lifted up its voice loudly in the House of Peers.|$|R
