5|$|Compton {{was one of}} {{a handful}} of {{scientists}} and philosophers to propose a two-stage model of free will. Others include William James, Henri Poincaré, Karl Popper, Henry Margenau, and Daniel Dennett. In 1931, Compton championed the idea of human freedom based on quantum <b>indeterminacy,</b> and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring chance into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the Schrödinger's cat paradox, which was published in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Although Musique funèbre was internationally acclaimed, his new {{harmonic}} techniques led {{to something}} of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which he still could not see how to express his musical ideas. Then on 16 March 1960, listening to Polish Radio broadcast on new music, he happened to hear John Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra. Although he was not influenced by the sound or {{the philosophy of the}} music, Cage's explorations of <b>indeterminacy</b> set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching. His Three Postludes were hastily rounded off (he had intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.|$|E
25|$|Arguably, {{concurrent}} {{logic programming}} {{is based on}} message passing and consequently {{is subject to the}} same <b>indeterminacy</b> as other concurrent message-passing systems, such as Actors (see <b>Indeterminacy</b> in concurrent computation). Carl Hewitt has argued that, concurrent logic programming is not based on logic in his sense that computational steps cannot be logically deduced. However, in concurrent logic programming, any result of a terminating computation is a logical consequence of the program, and any partial result of a partial computation is a logical consequence of the program and the residual goal (process network). Consequently, the <b>indeterminacy</b> of computations implies that not all logical consequences of the program can be deduced.|$|E
40|$|Parameter <b>indeterminacies</b> are {{inherent}} in 3 D computer vision. We show in this thesis that how they are treated can have {{significant impact on the}} accuracy of the estimated 3 D structure. However, {{there has not been a}} general and convenient method available for representing and analyzing the <b>indeterminacies</b> and their effects on accuracy. Consequently, up to the present their effects are usually ignored in uncertainty modeling research. In this work we a develop gauge-based uncertainty representation for 3 D estimation that includes <b>indeterminacies.</b> We represent <b>indeterminacies</b> with orbits in the parameter space and model local linearized parameter <b>indeterminacies</b> as gauge freedoms. Combining this formalism with first order perturbation theory, we are able to model uncertainties along with parameter <b>indeterminacies.</b> The key to our work is a geometric interpretation of the parameters and gauge freedoms. We solve the problem of how to compare parameter uncertainties despite <b>indeterminacies</b> and added constraints. This permits us to extend the Cramer-Rao lower bound to problems that include parameter <b>indeterminacies...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{parameters}} {{estimated by}} Structure from Motion contain inherent <b>indeterminacies.</b> In particular, shape and motion parameters are only recovered up to a similarity transformation. Past work on uncertainty modeling has imposed gauge {{constraints on the}} coordinates and scale {{to reduce the number}} of parameters and eliminate these <b>indeterminacies.</b> In this paper our approach is instead to maintain these <b>indeterminacies,</b> or gauge freedoms, in our covariance-based uncertainty representation. The solution is not unique so we define the normal form for a covariance matrix which captures the essential geometric uncertainty in the parameters along with the <b>indeterminacies,</b> and derive an equivalence relationship between covariances that capture the same geometric uncertainty. We then propose an efficient method for estimating the shape and motion covariances. The <b>indeterminacies</b> imply that Structure from Motion over-parametrizes the problem and that the parameters do not have direct physical meani [...] ...|$|R

They have each argued against relativism, supporting the Kantian view that universality is essential to any viable moral philosophy.

25|$|The One {{acts as the}} {{determining}} factor on the Indefinite Dyad, which is called 'the Great and the Small,' and eliminates its <b>indeterminacy,</b> which encompasses every possible relation between largeness and smallness or between excess and deficiency. Thus the One produces determinate relations between magnitudes by making the <b>indeterminacy</b> of the Indefinite Dyad determinate, and just these relations are understood by advocates of the unwritten doctrines to be the Forms of Numbers. This is the origin of determinate Twoness, which can from various perspectives {{be seen as the}} Form of Doubleness or the Form of Halfness. The other Forms of Numbers are derived in the same way out of the two fundamental principles. The structure of space is implicit in the Forms of Numbers: the dimensions of space somehow emerge from their relations. Key details of this extra-temporal emergence of space are missing from the surviving ancient testimonies, and its nature is debated in the scholarly literature.|$|E

30|$|Estimation of the PNL causal model (2) {{has several}} indeterminacies: the sign, mean, and {{scale of the}} error term varepsilon, and accordingly, the sign, location, and scale of f_i 1 are arbitrary. In the {{estimation}} procedure, one may impose certain constraints to avoid such <b>indeterminacies</b> in the estimate. However, we should note that in principle, we do not care about those <b>indeterminacies</b> in the causal discovery context, since they do not change the statistical independence or dependence property between the estimated error term and the hypothetical cause.|$|R

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Einstein's position underwent {{significant modifications}} {{over the course}} of the years. In the first stage, Einstein refused to accept quantum indeterminism and sought to demonstrate that the principle of <b>indeterminacy</b> could be violated, suggesting ingenious thought experiments which should permit the accurate determination of incompatible variables, such as position and velocity, or to explicitly reveal simultaneously the wave and the particle aspects of the same process.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} aspect of successfully analyzing data with blind source separation is to know the <b>indeterminacies</b> of the problem, {{that is how the}} separating model is related to the original mixing model. If linear independent component analysis (ICA) is used, {{it is well known that}} the mixing matrix can be found in principle, but for more general settings not many results exist. In this work, only considering random variables with bounded densities, we prove identifiability of the postnonlinear mixing model with analytic nonlinearities and calculate its <b>indeterminacies.</b> A simulation confirms these theoretical findings...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel {{approach}} for separating convolutive mixtures in the frequency domain.

In order to separate each instantaneous mixture, we will extend the criterion proposed in [4]. We also show that both the permutation and the amplitude <b>indeterminacies</b> can be removed using second-order statistics when the sources are temporally-white...|$|R

25|$|The central theses {{underlying}} the <b>indeterminacy</b> of translation and other extensions of Quine's work are ontological relativity {{and the related}} doctrine of confirmation holism. The premise of confirmation holism is that all theories (and the propositions derived from them) are under-determined by empirical data (data, sensory-data, evidence); although some theories are not justifiable, failing to fit with the data or being unworkably complex, there are many equally justifiable alternatives. While the Greeks' assumption that (unobservable) Homeric gods exist is false, and our supposition of (unobservable) electromagnetic waves is true, both are to be justified solely by their ability to explain our observations.|$|E
25|$|This {{has some}} {{interesting}} implications. For starters, Everett {{suggested that the}} universe is actually indeterminate as a whole. To see this, consider an observer measuring the spin of some particle, which previously is in an undetermined state (a superposition of possible spins). When you measure the spin, you may determine it to be up or down. But in fact, there has been a “splitting” of the universe into two states, one where you measure up, and the other where you measure down. Thus, the <b>indeterminacy</b> of the system simply grows and you become a part of it.|$|E
25|$|Bohr's {{argument}} about the impossibility of using the apparatus proposed by Einstein to violate the principle of <b>indeterminacy</b> depends crucially {{on the fact that}} a macroscopic system (the screen S1) obeys quantum laws. On the other hand, Bohr consistently held that, in order to illustrate the microscopic aspects of reality, it is necessary to set off a process of amplification, which involves macroscopic apparatuses, whose fundamental characteristic is that of obeying classical laws and which can be described in classical terms. This ambiguity would later come back in the form of what is still called today the measurement problem.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to the study of economic problems that have hitherto been modeled as games with discontinuous payoffs. Typically, the discontinuities arise from <b>indeterminacies</b> in the underlying problem. The authors' point of departure from the conventional approach is to view the sharing rules that resolve these <b>indeterminacies</b> as part of the solution rather than as part of the description of the model. A solution to the authors' model is a sharing rule, together with a profile of (mixed) strategies that satisfies the usual (Nash) best response criterion. Their main result is that such a solution always exists. Copyright 1990 by The Econometric Society. ...|$|R
