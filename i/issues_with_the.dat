5|$|Much of Redemption's {{criticism}} {{focused on}} technical problems {{when it was}} released, undermining the game experience or making it unplayable. Several reviewers noted <b>issues</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> initial lack of a function to save game progress at any point, which meant that dying or technical <b>issues</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> game could necessitate them to reload a previous save, and then repeat up to 30 minutes of gameplay. CGW added that the repetitive gameplay meant that losing progress and having to repeat it was a particular downside. Next Generation, who provided {{the game with a}} score of 3 out of 5, said that Redemption was potentially only a few patches away from being a 5 out of 5 game, if not for technical issues. PC Gamers review even included recommended instructions for cheats that worked around the technical flaws.|$|E

5|$|The Campaign for Borders Rail {{claimed in}} February 2016 that only 35½% of {{services}} were arriving on time at Tweedbank, {{which made the}} Borders Railway one of ScotRail's most poorly-performing services. In addition, reliability <b>issues</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Class 158 units and traincrew problems resulted {{in at least one}} train being cancelled on 74 of the 143 days between 31 March 2016 and 20 August 2016. This comprised 14 days of severe disruption due to crew shortages, 18 days as a result of <b>issues</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Class 158s and nine days for signalling failures. Crew shortages came about due to higher than expected levels of sickness as well as the difficulty of replacing staff during a popular period for annual leave. Reliability <b>issues</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Class 158s were encountered during hot weather which caused radiators to overheat, particularly on steep gradients with a heavy load, as coolant systems became stressed. To deal with the problem, ScotRail sought to replace the faulty radiators with superior quality models. Signalling problems were mainly due to water ingress into axle counters as well as a faulty telecommunications link coupled with a failure {{on the part of the}} automated fault-finding system to detect the problem locations.|$|E

5|$|Big Huge Games added {{multiple}} {{new features}} {{to the game}} during its development, {{in an attempt to}} fix <b>issues</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> original version. In an interview with GameSpot, executive producer Tim Train explained the development of the expansion pack. He stated how some nations were previously either too weak or too strong, and so features were added to balance gameplay. One way they did this is armed caravans and merchants were added to the Dutch nation, in order to weaken raids initiated by other players who rush their opponent. He said Big Huge Games brought in professional players in order to get suggestions on how to improve the game.|$|E

5|$|Born to Irish immigrants, Talbot was {{minimally}} educated, {{working in}} textile mills {{from an early}} age. He entered into a partnership with his brother, founding the Talbot Mills of Billerica in 1857. He became politically active, partly due to <b>issues</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mills, and served two terms as Lieutenant Governor, acting as Governor {{for part of the}} second term after Governor William B. Washburn won election to the United States Senate. Talbot was a strong temperance advocate, and his veto of a popular alcohol licensing bill contributed to his loss in the 1874 gubernatorial race. He was more successful in 1878 against divided opposition, serving a single lackluster term.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{argued that}} the {{confusing}} format of The Million Second Quiz, along with its lack of drama and technical <b>issues</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> show's app during {{the first days of}} the series, caused viewers to lose interest in watching it on air.

However, no demo was shown at E3, as the staff were still trying to fix some <b>issues</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> controls in the game. In September, the beta test program was postponed indefinitely.

5|$|Dishonored 2 was {{released}} {{to a positive}} reception. Praised were the improvements made since the first game: the more challenging stealth, the adaptability of Emily and Corvo's abilities to both play styles, the art direction, the creative design of individual missions, {{the realization of the}} game's world as well as the replay-value and the artificial intelligence. Criticism was directed at the lack of focus of the overarching narrative. Aside from this, technical blunders as well as <b>issues</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> PC version were received unfavorably. Dishonored 2 won the award for Best Action/Adventure Game at The Game Awards 2016 and for Costume Design at the 2017 NAVGTR Awards.|$|E
5|$|Fall of Cybertron {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics.

Graphics and audio also received broadly positive comments, though some reviewers noticed frame rate <b>issues</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> PlayStation 3 version. A tie-in titled , which is partially set between War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron was released June 24, 2014.|$|E
