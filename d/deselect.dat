5|$|Bessie's {{increasingly}} centrist stance troubled {{party members}} in Liverpool Exchange, where the Bevanite faction was generally popular. In 1954 the local party passed a motion requesting that she step down {{before the next}} general election. This {{was rejected by the}} NEC, who believed that Bessie was a national electoral asset. Shortly before the May 1955 general election the Exchange party tried again, and voted by 40 to 39 to <b>deselect</b> her. Bessie, convinced that this vote had been rigged, appealed to the NEC, who set the decision aside and imposed her on the constituency. These party machinations had no effect on Bessie's popularity with the voters; in the election on 26May, despite the intervention of a left-wing Independent Socialist candidate, she increased her majority to 7,186. Nevertheless, nationally the Conservatives retained power with an increased parliamentary majority. In the municipal elections held that same month, Labour won control of Liverpool's council for the first time; Jack Braddock became council leader. Bessie gave up her St Anne's ward seat, after 25 years, but remained on the council as a co-opted alderman.|$|E

For example, audio and video streams use separate RTP sessions, enabling a receiver to <b>deselect</b> a particular stream.

25|$|The {{matter is}} {{described}} in the following extract from {{an article in the}} Times dated 21 May 1987:“The Carshalton Conservative Association suffers from bigots and zealots who indulge in internecine warfare. Not Labour smear tactics, nor Alliance innuendo, but the words of its Conservative MP, Mr Nigel Forman. Several attempts to <b>deselect</b> Mr Forman failed. But when the election was called last week, five of the seven senior officers took their revenge on the beleaguered MP by resigning.” – The Times, May 1987.|$|E

25|$|There was {{widespread}} {{media coverage of}} her remarks, and Hodge was severely criticised for giving the BNP publicity. The BNP went on to gain 11 seats in the local election {{out of a total}} of 51, making them the second largest party on the local council. Local Labour activists attempted to blame Lady Hodge, and it was reported that moves were under way to <b>deselect</b> her (as PPC). The GMB wrote to Hodge in May 2006, demanding her resignation as a scapegoat for those election results.|$|E
500|$|In December 1951 Sephora Davies was {{expelled}} from the Labour Party because of her close association with a proscribed organisation, the British Soviet Friendship Society. Davies's deep roots in the Labour movement, and his large base of local support, saved him from a similar fate. In June 1953 he was attacked by Will Lawther, the NUM president, for defying the Labour Party's position and supporting the Soviet claim that a workers' rising in East Germany had been orchestrated by [...] "a CIA-sponsored West-German pro-fascist organisation". Lawther demanded that the local Merthyr Tydfil party <b>deselect</b> Davies as their parliamentary candidate, but they stood firm.|$|E
2500|$|Forman’s {{progressive}} views did not endear him to {{the leadership}} of his constituency Conservatives in Carshalton. Many of them regarded him as disloyal to Margaret Thatcher and a traitor. There were repeated attempts to <b>deselect</b> him. Matters {{came to a head}} in 1986 after the Liberal SDP Alliance took control of Sutton Borough Council from the Conservatives. Forman publicly attributed this to the shortcomings of the local Conservative leadership.|$|E

2500|$|Pay for {{performance}} programs often target patients with serious and complex illnesses; such patients commonly interact with multiple healthcare providers and facilities. However, pilot programs now underway focus on simple indicators such as improvement in lab values {{or use of}} emergency services, avoiding areas of complexity such as multiple complications or several treating specialists. A 2007 study analyzing Medicare beneficiaries' healthcare visits showed that a median of two primary care physicians and five specialists provide care for a single patient. The authors doubt that pay-for-performance systems can accurately attribute responsibility for the outcome of care for such patients. The American College of Physicians Ethics has stated concerns about using a limited set of clinical practice parameters to assess quality, [...] "especially if payment for good performance is grafted onto the current payment system, which does not reward robust comprehensive care...The elderly patient with multiple chronic conditions is especially vulnerable to this unwanted effect of powerful incentives." [...] Present pay-for-performance systems measure good performance based on specified clinical measurements, such as glycohemoglobin for diabetic patients. Healthcare providers who are monitored by such limited criteria have a powerful incentive to <b>deselect</b> (dismiss or refuse to accept) patients whose outcome measures fall below the quality standard and therefore worsen the provider's assessment. Patients with low health literacy, inadequate financial resources to afford expensive medications or treatments, and ethnic groups traditionally subject to healthcare inequities may also be deselected by providers seeking improved performance measures.|$|E

30|$|Due to the {{one-to-one}} mappings between {{features and}} system components and parameters, the CA uses a basic {{set of four}} reconfiguration operations to instruct the CM, namely: add (feature selected), remove (feature <b>deselected),</b> replace (one feature selected and other <b>deselected</b> in an alternative relationship), and update component (feature representing a component parameter is selected or <b>deselected).</b> However these operations {{do not have an}} specific semantics. For instance, adding a component can mean to deploy it on a particular slot of the system that requires an specific interface, or it can mean to connect a new component with an already deployed one, among others. The Component Manager and operation classes must be extended in order to apply the approach on a particular system and provide semantics to these operations.|$|R
