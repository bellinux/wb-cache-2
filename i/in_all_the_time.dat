2500|$|During an {{interview}} John Stalker, Deputy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester {{in the early}} 1980s and himself a Detective Inspector in 1973, has stated that the depiction of the police [...] "has {{got nothing to do}} with real policing in the 1970s. It could not be more inaccurate in terms of procedure, the way they talk or the way they dress. <b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> I was in the CID in the 1970s I never saw a copper in a leather bomber jacket and I never heard an officer call anyone 'guv'.... Actually, there were a few police officers in London who started to behave like Regan and Carter in The Sweeney, but that was a case of life following art, not the other way round". The journalist who interviewed Stalker, Ray King, remarks that the depiction of the police can be defended if we assume that Sam is indeed in a coma and that we are seeing his imaginary idea of 1973, filtered through 1970s cop shows.|$|E
2500|$|... "Be Black, Baby" [...] {{was filmed}} {{in black and}} white stock on 16mm, in low-light {{conditions}} that stress the crudity of the direct cinema aesthetic. It is precisely from this crudity that the film itself gains a credibility of [...] "realism." [...] In an interview with Michael Bliss, De Palma notes [...] " [...] was rehearsed for almost three weeks... In fact, it's all scripted. But once the thing starts, they just go with the way it's going. I specifically got a very good documentary camera filmmaker (Robert Elfstrom) to just shoot it like a documentary to follow the action." [...] Furthermore, [...] "I wanted to show in Hi, Mom! how you can really involve an audience. You take an absurd premise – [...] "Be Black, Baby" [...] – and totally involve them and really frighten them at the same time. It's very Brechtian. You suck 'em in and annihilate 'em. Then you say, [...] "It's just a movie, right? It's not real." [...] It's just like television. You're sucked <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and you're being lied to in a very documentary-like setting. The [...] "Be Black, Baby" [...] section of Hi, Mom! is probably the most important piece of film I've ever done." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{was also}} claimed that one Sunday Liddell {{refereed}} a hockey match {{to stop fighting}} amongst the players, as he was trusted not to take sides. One of his fellow internees, Norman Cliff, later {{wrote a book about}} his experiences in the camp called [...] "The Courtyard of the Happy Way" [...] (Chinese 樂道院, also translated as [...] "The Campus of Loving Truth"), which detailed the remarkable characters in the camp. Cliff described Liddell as [...] "the finest Christian gentleman it has been my pleasure to meet. <b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in the camp, I never heard him say a bad word about anybody". Langdon Gilkey, who also survived the camp and became a prominent theologian in his native America, said of Liddell: [...] "Often in an evening I would see him bent over a chessboard or a model boat, or directing some sort of square dance– absorbed, weary and interested, pouring all of himself into this effort to capture the imagination of these penned-up youths. He was overflowing with good humour and love for life, and with enthusiasm and charm. It is rare indeed that a person has the good fortune to meet a saint, but he came as close to it as anyone I have ever known." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before I {{came to this}} country, and <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> I {{have been}} here, it has never {{occurred}} to me to think of New York as being beautiful. [...] Therefore all this talk of beautifying New York seems strange to me. If we were discussing Bismarck I might ask five hundred questions about him before I should think of asking whether he was beautiful. ... So it is with New York. We expect of her power and magnificence, but not beauty. If a European came over here and found that New York was beautiful {{in the same way as}} the European cities he knew he would be very much disappointed. I do not see how you can make New York beautiful in that way with the laws and the democratic spirit that you have here [...] The kind of beauty that makes Paris charming can only exist when private rights and personal liberty are or have been trampled on. [...] Only when the mob rules, or where kings rule, so that there is at one time absolutely no respect for the property of the rich and at another time for the rights of the poor can the beauties of Paris be realized.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 August 2010, the Russian Islamist website Kavkaz Center claimed Umarov had officially {{announced}} his resignation {{for health reasons}} and appointed his military deputy Aslambek Vadalov as his successor. He appointed Vadalov saying [...] "that jihad should be led by younger and more energetic commanders." [...] Although {{he added that he}} would [...] "continue to wage jihad and will do his utmost to help the new leadership. [...] does not mean that I give up jihad. I will do whatever I can by word and deed." [...] On 4 August, he contradicted the claim issued by him on video saying [...] "Due to the situation in the Caucasus I consider that it is impossible for me to quit my duties. The previous declaration is annulled. It is a falsification. I declare that my health is good to serve Allah. And I will serve the word of Allah and work to kill the enemies of Allah <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that he gives me to live on this earth." [...] He called the initial video a [...] "fabrication," [...] but did not say why there was a conflict. Later in 2010, Vadalov and the Arab mujahid Muhannad attempted to overthrow Umarov {{as the leader of the}} Caucasus Emirate. The [...] "supreme judge" [...] of the group, Sayfullah and Emir Adam, the [...] "governor of Ingushetia province", continued to support Umarov. Umarov blamed the split in the organization for Muhannad, who was killed by Russian forces in April 2011, paving the way for re-unification. In July 2011, the insurgents' supreme Islamic court ruled in favour of recognizing Umarov as the leader of the Caucasus Emirate. Amir Khamzat, the commander of the Riyad-us-Saliheen Martyr Brigade suicide battalion was named the commander of the western sector; Hussein Gakayev was named to lead the eastern sector. Vadalov and Tarkhan Gaziyev consequently followed suit and re-affirmed their allegiance to Umarov. Umarov then warned Russia that it would be the target of a new strengthened insurgency as he promised a year of [...] "blood and tears" [...] as a result of the new unity.|$|E
