50|$|Alternately, a {{new breed}} of cooling system is being developed, {{inserting}} a pump into the thermo siphon loop. This adds another degree of flexibility for the design engineer, as the heat can now be effectively transported away from the heat source and either reclaimed or dissipated to ambient. Junction temperature can be tuned by adjusting the system pressure; higher pressure equals higher fluid saturation temperatures. This allows for smaller condensers, smaller fans, and/or the effective dissipation of heat in a high ambient temperature environment. These systems are, in essence, the next generation fluid cooling paradigm, as they are approximately 10 times more efficient than single phase water. Since the system uses a dielectric as the <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> <b>medium,</b> leaks do not cause a catastrophic failure of the electric system.|$|E

In the present paper, all fusion welding processes are categorized in terms of the welding power density delivered {{to the surface of the}} workpiece.

In the low heat density regime, characterized by oxyacetylene and electroslag welding, convection within the metal and slag pools controls the <b>heat</b> <b>transport.</b> In the <b>medium</b> <b>heat</b> density regime, characterized by most arc welding processes, a number of phenomena have been shown to have an influence on weld pool shape; ho~v ever, no formalism has been developed which allmvs a pi"io·pi estimation of the weld geometry.

The response of the Pacific oceanic <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> to El Niño–like winds, extratropical winds, and variations in the Indonesian Throughflow is studied. Large, opposing changes {{are found in the}} <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> by the meridional overturning and the horizontal gyres in response to El Niño–like winds. Consequently, the change in total <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> is relatively small. The overturning transport decreases and the gyres spin down when the winds decrease in the Tropics.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the concept and}} preliminary component testing of a gas-cooled, UN-fueled, pin-type reactor which uses He/Xe gas that goes directly into a recuperated Brayton system to produce electricity for nuclear electric propulsion. This Direct-Drive Gas-Cooled Reactor (DDG) {{is designed to be}} subcritical under water or wet- sand immersion in case of a launch accident. Because the gas-cooled reactor can directly drive the Brayton turbomachinery, it is possible to configure the system such that there are no external surfaces or pressure boundaries that are refractory metal, even though the gas delivered to the turbine is 1144 K. The He/Xe gas mixture is a good <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> <b>medium</b> when flowing, and a good insulator when stagnant. Judicious use of stagnant cavities as insulating regions allows transport of the 1144 -K gas while keeping all external surfaces below 900 K. At this temperature super-alloys (Hastelloy or Inconel) can be used instead of refractory metals. Super-alloys reduce the technology risk because they are easier to fabricate than refractory metals, we have a much more extensive knowledge base on their characteristics, and, because they have a greater resistance to oxidation, system testing is eased. The system is also relatively simple in its design: no additional coolant pumps, heat exchanger, or freeze-thaw systems are required. Key to success of this concept is a good knowledge of the heat transfer between the fuel pins and the gas, as well as the pressure drop through the system. This paper describes preliminary testing to obtain this key information, as well as experience in demonstrating electrically heated testing of simulated reactor components...|$|E

This TDRM will aid {{in the development and}} selection of the required heat exchanger for: power production (the first anticipated process heat application), hydrogen production, steam methane reforming, methanol to gasoline production, or ammonia production. This TDRM (a) establishes the current state of molten salt SHX technology readiness, (b) defines a path forward that systematically and effectively tests this technology to overcome areas of uncertainty, (c) demonstrates the achievement of an appropriate level of maturity prior to construction and plant operation, and (d) identifies issues and prioritizes future work for maturing the state of SHX technology. This study discusses the results of a preliminary design analysis of the SHX and explains the evaluation and selection methodology. An important engineering challenge will be to prevent the molten salt from freezing during normal and off-normal operations because of its high melting temperature (390 °C for KF ZrF 4). The efficient transfer of energy for industrial applications depends on the ability to incorporate cost-effective heat exchangers between the nuclear heat transport system and industrial process heat transport system. The need for efficiency, compactness, and safety challenge the capabilities of existing heat exchanger technology. The description of potential heat exchanger configurations or designs (such as printed circuit, spiral or helical coiled, ceramic, plate and fin, and plate type) were covered in an earlier report (Sabharwall et al. 2011). Significant future work, much of which is suggested in this report, is needed before the benefits and full potential of the AHTR can be realized. The execution of this TDRM will focuses research efforts on the near-term qualification, selection, or maturation strategy as detailed in this report.

The signal of current and voltage during the calorimetric experiments is used to calculate the <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> to the welding plate. This calculation is done {{with the help of a}} computer program which analyses the measured signals of current and voltage. In this calculation is taken into account both the <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> to the electrode and the <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> to the weld pool. Also is looked for the influence of the welding parameters on some efficiencies. The stability of the process is strongly depending on the transport of the electrode material. Electrode melting plays an important role in the transport of the electrode material and therefore <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> is important for the stability of the process. The results from the calorimetric experiments show that the <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> to the welding plate is at most with maximum stability.

This RF scheme provides a dominant localised ion heating, but also some electron heating, and therefore both ion and electron heat channels were modulated. This allows {{to carry out a}} simultaneous transport analysis of ion and electron <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> channels, including transient transport phenomena. This also provides an experimental assessment of the ICRH heat sources of the 3 He scheme. The modulation approach, so far widely used for electron transport studies, has been validated for ion <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> in these experiments and yields results on stiffness and threshold of the ITG-driven ion <b>heat</b> <b>transport.</b> The results for the electron channel demonstrate the importance of the ITG-driven, off-diagonal, contribution to electron <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> in plasmas with significant ion heating...|$|R

30|$|However, {{being aware}} of the complex {{temperature}} distribution at depth {{is not enough to}} reduce the exploration risk as the productivity is another key parameter for geothermal energy production. To enable a reliable temperature prediction for a geothermal reservoir, the significant <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> mechanisms coupled to the fluid flow processes in the respected area have to be understood on a bigger scale. Thereby, different types of <b>heat</b> <b>transport</b> acting in a sedimentary basin should be considered (Kaiser et al. 2011): (1) conductive <b>heat</b> <b>transport,</b> where the efficiency of heat transfer depends on the thermal conductivity of the lithology of the respective layer and the occurring thermal gradient; (2) advective <b>heat</b> <b>transport,</b> where <b>heat</b> is <b>transported</b> passively by pressure-driven fluid flow; and (3) convective <b>heat</b> <b>transport,</b> where <b>heat</b> is <b>transported</b> by density-driven convective fluid flow. In a fluid influenced geothermal environment, such as the Molasse Basin, a combination of all three heat-driving mechanisms can be expected, as been already shown for other sedimentary basins, e.g. for the North German Basin by Kaiser et al. (2011) and Noack et al. (2013) and for the Po Plain by Pasquale et al. (2013).|$|R
