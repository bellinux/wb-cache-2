5|$|The {{university}} historically pioneered {{research and}} training collaborations between academia, industry and government.

On the other hand, MIT's extensive collaboration {{with the federal government}} on research projects has led to several MIT leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940. MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy.|$|E
