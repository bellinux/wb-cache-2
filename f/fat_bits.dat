2500|$|Debauchery is {{a primary}} theme {{throughout}} the album, stemming from Wainwright's struggles with addiction and quest for fame. [...] "Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk" [...] best reflects this motif, directly addressing decadence and desire ("Everything it seems I like's a little bit sweeter/A little <b>bit</b> <b>fatter,</b> a little <b>bit</b> harmful for me"). The song has been called an [...] "ode to subtle addictions and the way our compulsions rule our lives."

60|$|The {{effect of}} {{all he did was}} that the terror with which she {{regarded}} him gradually wore off; and next day, when she seemed to be recovering her strength, he proposed by signs to remove her to the cave higher up, where she would be sheltered in case of rain. She appeared to understand him, and allowed herself to be taken up in his arms and carried with much labour {{to the top of the}} chasm. In the cave he made her a second couch, and tended her assiduously. He made a fire on the floor and kept it burning night and day, and supplied her with water to drink and fresh leaves for her foot. There was little more that he could do. From the choicest and <b>fattest</b> <b>bits</b> of toasted tapir flesh he offered her she turned away with disgust. A little cassava bread soaked in water she would take, but seemed not to like it. After a time, fearing that she would starve, he took to hunting after wild fruits, edible bulbs and gums, and on these small things she subsisted during the whole time of their sojourn together in the desert.|$|R

5000|$|Leigh {{began his}} career in non-League {{football}} with Swaythling, leaving them as a seventeen-year-old in October 1979 to join Football League team Bournemouth. Leigh made his professional debut for Bournemouth in 1981 after replacing the injured Kenny Allen in an away game against Peterborough United, {{a game in which}} Bournemouth lost 1-0. Over the next five seasons, Leigh made 123 appearances in the Football League for Bournemouth. While playing in the FA Cup against defending champions Manchester United in January 1984, Leigh kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 victory, and was rewarded with a lifetime supply of pizzas from a local Italian restaurant. The deal stayed in place for over a year, until Bournemouth's then manager Harry Redknapp bought the restaurant, citing the fact that Leigh was getting, [...] "a <b>bit</b> <b>fat,</b> a little <b>bit</b> lumpy." [...] Towards the end of his Bournemouth career, Leigh spent brief loan spells at Bristol City and Torquay United, making one and four appearances respectively. After Leigh left Bournemouth in 1986, he briefly played non-League football for Bashley, before moving to Malta to play with Hamrun Spartans, where he spent a further six seasons. Leigh was renowned for his powerful long shots, and became Ħamrun Spartans' penalty taker.|$|R
5000|$|... exFAT allows {{individual}} files {{larger than}} 4 GiB, facilitating long continuous recording of HD video which can exceed the 4 GiB limit {{in less than}} an hour. Current digital cameras using FAT32 will break the video files into multiple segments of approximately 2 or 4 GiB. With the increase of capacity and the increase of data being transferred, the write operation needs to be made more efficient. SDXC cards, running at UHS-I have a minimum guaranteed write speed of 10 MBps and exFAT plays a factor in achieving that throughput through the reduction of the file system overhead in cluster allocation. This is achieved through the introduction of a cluster bitmap and elimination (or reduction) of writes to the <b>FAT.</b> A single <b>bit</b> in the directory record indicates that the file is contiguous, telling the exFAT driver to ignore the FAT.This optimization is analogous to an extent in other file systems, except that it only applies to whole files, as opposed to contiguous parts of files.|$|R
5000|$|Through the Eyes {{received}} mixed-to-positive {{reviews from}} critics. According to Mark Jenkins of the Washington Post, [...] "Like Sevendust, Flaw is apparently still smarting from childhood trauma" [...] and, ultimately, [...] "Flaw lets its guard down". The PRP website gave Through the Eyes 3.5 out of 5, {{and said that}} the album [...] "is a strong showing from a band who have a lot to offer". It praised the album's musicianship, saying that the only [...] "flaw" [...] was that Flaw [...] "could benefit from trimming some of the proverbial <b>fat</b> a <b>bit</b> closer to the bone next time out, because in their current state, they at times can feel a bit too long winded and unnecessary". AntiGUY of AntiMUSIC gave Through the Eyes four smiley faces and wrote that the album [...] "is the perfect counter argument to those who would casually dismiss the nu metal genre as only simplistic drop tuned guitars pounding out unremitting powerchords and primal screaming vocals". AntiGUY praised Volz' vocals, comparing Flaw to Factory 81 and A Perfect Circle. According to Brian O'Neill of AllMusic, [...] "A few catchy tracks - such as the lead single, [...] "Payback," [...] and the eerie [...] "My Letter" [...] - are surrounded by filler that fails to stick". However, O'Neill called Volz' singing [...] "powerful and melodious". Andy Schwegler wrote that Through the Eyes [...] "is perfect if you want 13 tracks of jamming for your car, but it ultimately runs thin in the long run".|$|R
5000|$|In {{discussing}} his race, Retronauts discussed how King Hippo was a racial stereotype of islanders (specifically {{that they were}} all <b>fat</b> and lavish). <b>Bit</b> Mob editor Brian Shirk commented that the stereotypes utilized in King Hippo were uncalled for, stating that his [...] "subhuman caricature is particularly offensive, and it likely stems from the typically savage portrayal of Polynesians in literature and film." [...] GameDaily commented that while he is a [...] "lovable oaf," [...] others may see him as a [...] "fat Pacific Islander who loves stuffing his face." [...] King Hippo's weakness {{is considered one of the}} things that makes King Hippo iconic. Game Informer writes that the [...] "secret to beating this flabby fighter was probably even more widely known than the 30-lives code in Contra". Colette Bennett echoed sentiments of the notability of his weakness and said that [...] "anyone could tell you King Hippo's weak point". 1UP.com editor Bob Mackey also listed him as the third worst dressed video game character, called the fight with him an [...] "iconic moment in gaming." [...] Mackey added that King Hippo's shorts falling down was [...] "talk of the schoolyards during the 80's". GamesRadar editor Chris Antista comments that his role in Captain N was his biggest achievement.|$|R
60|$|Steve {{wrote to}} me once, and his letter seemed irritated. He took it kind of hard because I’d left him with Spot. Also, he said he’d used the “rough-on-rats,” per directions, {{and that there was}} nothing doing. A year went by. I was back in the office and prospering in all ways—even getting a <b>bit</b> <b>fat.</b> And then Steve arrived. He didn’t look me up. I read his name in the steamer list, and {{wondered}} why. But I didn’t wonder long. I got up one morning and found that Spot chained to the gate-post and holding up the milkman. Steve went north to Seattle, I learned, that very morning. I didn’t put on any more weight. My wife made me buy him a collar and tag, and within an hour he showed his gratitude by killing her pet Persian cat. There is no getting rid of that Spot. He will be with me until I die, for he’ll never die. My appetite is not so good since he arrived, and my wife says I am looking peaked. Last night that Spot got into Mr. Harvey’s hen-house (Harvey is my next-door neighbour) and killed nineteen of his fancy-bred chickens. I shall have to pay for them. My neighbours on the other side quarrelled with my wife and then moved out. Spot was the cause of it. And that is why I am disappointed in Stephen Mackaye. I had no idea he was so mean a man.|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between pulmonary function, nutritional status, body image, and eating attitudes in children with cystic fibrosis (CF) compared with healthy controls. Method. Seventy-six children with CF (39 girls) and 153 healthy control children (82 girls) were recruited. All children were between 7 and 12 years of age. After being weighed and measured, participants undertook a structured 1 -to- 1 interview. Four measures were used to assess body image: body size (perception and satisfaction) were ascertained using the Children 2 ̆ 7 s Body Image Scale (CBIS), which uses photographs of children of various body mass index (BMI) representative of the range of BMI percentiles for children 7 to 12 years of age. Body size satisfaction was measured by the response to the questions, "Do you think your body is 1) much too thin, 2) too thin, 3) just right, 4) too fat, and 5) much too fat?" Body weight satisfaction was measured by the question, "Would you like your body to be 1) much thinner, 2) a little bit thinner, 3) stay the same, 4) a little <b>bit</b> <b>fatter,</b> and 5) much fatter?" Global self-esteem was measured using the children 2 ̆ 7 s version of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and Body Esteem Scale using a 24 -item scale. Dieting behavior was measured by asking directly about previous weight control behaviors, use of the Dutch Eating Behavior-Restraint Scale (DEBQ-R), and, in children who acknowledged previous dieting behavior, the Children 2 ̆ 7 s Eating Attitude Test (ChEAT) was additionally administered. Results. Both girls and boys with CF had significantly reduced BMI percentiles compared with control children. Boys with CF did not have a significantly different BMI compared with girls with CF. There were significant positive correlations between forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) (...|$|R
