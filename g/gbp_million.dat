40|$|Background: We {{report the}} first study that {{analyses}} public and philanthropic investments awarded to UK institutions for research related to sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Methods: We systematically searched award data from the major funders for information on all infectious disease research funding awarded in 1997 – 2013. The STI–related projects were identified and categorised by pathogen, disease and type of science along the research pipeline from preclinical to translational research. Findings: We identified 7393 infection–related awards with total investment of GBP 3. 5 billion. Of these, 1238 awards (16. 7 %) covering funding of <b>GBP</b> 719. 1 <b>million</b> (20. 5 %) were for STI research. HIV as an STI received <b>GBP</b> 465 <b>million</b> across 719 studies; non–HIV STIs received <b>GBP</b> 139 <b>million</b> across 378 studies. The Medical Research Council provided greatest investment (<b>GBP</b> 193 <b>million</b> for HIV, <b>GBP</b> 45 <b>million</b> for non–HIV STIs). Preclinical awards totalled <b>GBP</b> 233 <b>million</b> (37. 1 %), whilst translational research received <b>GBP</b> 286 <b>million</b> (39. 7 %). Substantial proportions of HIV investment addressed global health research (<b>GBP</b> 265 <b>million),</b> vaccinology (<b>GBP</b> 110 <b>million)</b> and therapeutics (<b>GBP</b> 202 <b>million).</b> For other STIs, investments focused on diagnostics (<b>GBP</b> 45 <b>million)</b> and global health (<b>GBP</b> 27 <b>million).</b> Human Papilloma Virus research received <b>GBP</b> 58 <b>million</b> and chlamydia <b>GBP</b> 24 <b>million.</b> Funding for non–HIV STIs has declined in the three most recent years of this data set. Conclusions: The investment for HIV research awarded to UK institutions correlates with the high global burden, but other STIs are relatively neglected, including gonorrhoea and syphilis. Future STI funding should be better aligned with burden while addressing the emerging risk of antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae and outbreaks of other pathogens...|$|R
