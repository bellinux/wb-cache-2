5|$|Because {{these three}} surface {{energies}} form {{the sides of}} a triangle, they are constrained by the triangle inequalities, γij < γjk + γik meaning that no one of the surface tensions can exceed {{the sum of the}} other two.

5|$|The {{boundaries}} of most counties in Arizona <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> the northern {{boundary of the}} Gadsden Purchase, but six counties in Arizona do have most of their populations within {{the land of the}} Gadsden Purchase. Four of these also contain areas north of the Gadsden Purchase, but these areas do have low population densities, with the exception of northeastern Pinal County, Arizona, including the towns of Apache Junction and Florence. Maricopa County also extends south into the area of the Gadsden Purchase, but this area is also thinly populated. Tucson is the largest city in the Gadsden Purchase.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether new {{elements}} will continue {{the pattern of the}} current periodic table as period 8, or require further adaptations or adjustments. Seaborg expected the eighth period to follow the previously established pattern exactly, so that it would include a two-element s-block for elements 119 and 120, a new g-block for the next 18 elements, and 30 additional elements continuing the current f-, d-, and p-blocks, culminating in element 168, the next noble gas. More recently, physicists such as Pekka Pyykkö have theorized that these additional elements <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> the Madelung rule, which predicts how electron shells are filled and thus affects the appearance of the present periodic table. There are currently several competing theoretical models for the placement of the elements of atomic number {{less than or equal to}} 172.|$|E
5|$|Jackals, or Kig-Yar, (from {{the moon}} of Eayn, {{orbiting}} Chu'ot) carry energy shields or ranged weaponry. Shield or armor colors denotes {{the rank of}} each caste. In some cases, such as with the Jackals, the overall design was honed once the enemy's role was clearly defined. They look like bird-like creatures or raptors. This particular species did not come into the Covenant {{in the same way}} as other species. They work as mercenaries, as their culture is based on piracy and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> the religious beliefs like the other species. In the Halo book, Halo: Contact Harvest, it was revealed that Jackals were the first species in the Covenant to encounter humanity. The resulting events initiated the start of the Human-Covenant War.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{striking}} in his symphonic poems is Liszt's approach to musical form. As purely musical structures, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> a strict presentation {{and development of}} musical themes as they would under sonata form. Instead, they follow a loose episodic pattern, in which motifsrecurring melodies associated with a subjectare thematically transformed {{in a manner similar}} to that later made famous by Richard Wagner. Recapitulations, where themes are normally restated after they are combined and contrasted in development, are foreshortened, while codas, where pieces of music generally wind to a close, are greatly enlarged to a size and scope that can affect the listener's concept of the themes. Themes shuffle into new and unexpected patterns of order, and three- or four-movement structures roll into one in a continual process of creative experimentation.|$|E

5|$|A {{separate}} {{criminal investigation}} {{focused on the}} illegal factory itself. Almost all factories and homes in the area were illegal and unauthorised, and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> building codes and sanctions. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said action would be taken against {{the owners of the}} factory and house, and Superintendent of Police of South 24 Parganas S. N. Gupta said that the owners of the building would be arrested. Investigation has shown that the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) issued notices to the building on three separate occasions, in 1988, 1989, and 1992, yet took no further action. It has been shown, however, that the KMC also approved trade licences for two businesses to operate from the building. The owner of the building, Khurshid Alam, has had a police complaint filed against him by the fire department for illegal construction charges. Mohammed Sagir Ahmed and Mohammed Asif, the owners of Tenex Exports, also face related charges. Both investigations are ongoing.|$|E
5|$|During sessions, {{members may}} speak after being called {{on by the}} President. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates. Partly due {{to the need for}} translation, and the {{politics}} of consensus in the chamber, debates tend to be calmer and more polite than, say, the Westminster system. Voting is conducted primarily by a show of hands, that may be checked on request by electronic voting. Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case, however; that only occurs when there is a roll-call ballot. This is required for the final votes on legislation and also whenever a political group or 30 MEPs request it. The number of roll-call votes has increased with time. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example, when the president is elected). All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the Official Journal of the European Union and can be accessed online. Votes usually <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>follow</b> a debate, but rather they are grouped with other due votes on specific occasions, usually at noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. This is because the length of the vote is unpredictable and if it continues for longer than allocated it can disrupt other debates and meetings later in the day.|$|E
