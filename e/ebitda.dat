5|$|For {{the first}} time in its five-year operation, the Company {{reported}} a net income of NT$5.78 billion, with earnings per share of NT$0.59. Between 2010 and 2011, revenues increased by 16.65% from NT$27.64 billion to NT$32.24 billion, with operating costs and expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) rising by only 4.98%. Over the same period of time, gross profit totaled NT$12.98 billion (an increase of 30.32%), income from operations totaled NT$12.06 billion (an increase of 32.93%) and <b>EBITDA</b> totaled NT$22.73 billion (an increase of 22.34%). 2011 gross profit, income from operation and <b>EBITDA</b> were all record highs.

5|$|On 16 November 2010, it was {{revealed}} that the Glazers were to pay off the remaining £220million contained within the PIK loans by 22 November 2010. The loans were by then accruing interest at a rate of 16.25%, as the club's overall debt had exceeded its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (<b>EBITDA)</b> by more than five times. However, the club claimed that none of its own money had been put towards the repayment, raising questions as to how the Glazer family had raised the funds; suggested methods include the sale of a minority stake in the club to a third party, the sale of {{some or all of the}} family's other businesses, and – the most likely option – the refinancing of the PIKs with another loan at a lower interest rate.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, 30,000 {{vehicles}} a day {{traveled on}} the expressway, which fulfilled state expectations; however, complaints were {{made about the}} toll machines, due to their low height and needing the exact amount of the toll. In late 2009, the South Bay Expressway partnership that operated the road questioned {{the value of the}} toll road for property tax purposes, saying that it was worth $330 million less than it was originally valued due to the low volumes of traffic using the road. On March 22, 2010, the toll road's operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing traffic counts running at less than 40 percent of initial estimates due to the economic downturn. Some drivers chose not to use the toll road due to a recent increase in tolls. An editorial in the San Diego Union-Tribune also blamed the delay in opening the toll road and the associated penalties, interest, and legal fees for the company's financial status. According to the bankruptcy filing, the expressway had $510 million of loans outstanding, of which $170 million was owed to the U.S. Department of Transportation. In addition, there was over $600 million of unresolved litigation with the construction contractors. The gross earnings (<b>EBITDA)</b> for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 were approximately $3 million on revenues of $21 million.|$|E
25|$|The company’s <b>EBITDA</b> {{growth for}} the 2012 was AED 3.99 billion, 37.10%, {{representing}} an <b>EBITDA</b> margin of 39.37% for 2012. Net profit before royalty grew by 55.81% to reach AED 2.82 billion in 2012. The Federal Government confirmed the royalty charge for 2012 at 5% of revenue and 17.5% of profit, resulting in net profit after royalty of AED 1.98 billion.|$|E
25|$|Partizan {{operates}} as a sports association, as part of Partizan Sports Association, which includes 26 clubs in different sports, but it has complete independence regarding organisation, management, finances, material goods and facilities.

25|$|Despite recent {{declines in}} sales, {{management}} sees {{the company as}} progressing toward those goals. In his letter, Morone points {{to an increase in}} adjusted <b>EBITDA</b> despite increased spending on research and development. At the same time, the company was able to pay down $32 million in debt, and fully fund its pension plans in the U.S., U.K. and Canada.|$|E
25|$|In May 2016, ESPN {{originally}} {{reported that}} the UFC's parent company Zuffa, LLC was in talks to sell the company for $3.5 billion to $4 billion. (In 2015, the UFC had a reported <b>EBITDA</b> of $200–250 million.) Because it was a privately owned company, no official comment was made from the UFC or Dana White regarding the sale. Companies initially interested in the sale were Dalian Wanda Group, China Media Capital, and WME–IMG.|$|E
25|$|Banks, {{telephone}} service companies, Internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services, often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates {{as one of}} their key business metrics (along with cash flow, <b>EBITDA,</b> etc.) because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one. Companies from these sectors often have customer service branches which attempt to win back defecting clients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients.|$|E

500|$|In {{cumulative}} figures, until July 2008, depreciation {{and interest}} were equal to 95% of THSRC's accumulated debt. Both THSRC and a September 2009 government report identified an unreasonable financial {{structure and the}} resulting high interest rates and high depreciation charges as the main causes of negative financial performance, while the government assessed THSRC to have performed well in its core business, as measured by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (<b>EBITDA).</b> [...] To reduce its interest load, THSRC sought to revise its loan structure in 2008 and again in 2009. To reduce depreciation costs by increasing the amortization time, THSRC requested an extension of its 35-year concession period.|$|E
500|$|Having {{spent some}} US$4 billion {{during this period}} under the {{stewardship}} of Kikukawa, the company's aggressive strategy of external growth was not without criticism. According to an Olympus employee, the acquisitions process and funds movements were under the tight control of a small circle of executives in the 'Financial Affairs Group'. Japanese business daily {{is quoted as saying}} more than a hundred businesses were acquired during Kikukawa's tenure, and that the majority were unlisted and loss-making. The investments were in diverse sectors such as pet care and DVD production, and often had little connection with the core Olympus business. The most significant acquisition was the British medical equipment maker Gyrus Group, acquired in 2008 at a cost of $2billion – the equivalent of almost 5 times turnover and 27 times <b>EBITDA.</b> In the same year, Olympus also paid out ¥73.5billion ($965 million) when it acquired three [...] "small venture firms" [...] – Altis, Humalabo, and NewsChef. By contrast, in 2009 Olympus sold the profitable diagnostics unit it had built up over 40 years to Beckman Coulter for $1 billion – approximately two times turnover – to free up capital.|$|E

The improvement of this result, {{in a market}} still characterized by price pressure, was primarily due to the key initiatives taken by the Ferretti Group {{during the course of}} the 2009-2010 nautical year, which resulted in a cost reduction of around 50 million euro. As of August, 31st, 2010, the Group’s Net Financial Debt improved compared with the previous year and was reduced to around 590 million euro, basically in line with the Plan.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} in June 2014 that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) was investing an additional $3.5 billion in equity into First Data, after KKR raised the money with a private sale of its stock. The injection of equity lowered First Data's debt from around $24 billion to $20.7 billion, and was generally hailed in the press as a saving grace for the company. Previously First Data's interest payments had come to $440 million a year, which had used up 75 percent of the company's $2.4 billion of <b>EBITDA</b> (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization).

In 2008 both operations showed a positive <b>EBITDA.</b> In Sweden the mobile network is shared with Telenor, except for cities like Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmo, Lund and Karlskrona where they handle their own 3G networks, but this practise is not allowed in Denmark. In the spring 2011 3 started, without Telenor, to build their own 3G Network on the UMTS 900-band which will give a bigger coverage. UMTS 900 and LTE 800 is rolled out using the same base stations. Today 3 Sweden covers about 98.5% of the Swedish population. In May 2012, 3 Sweden launched it first LTE services. It uses the TDD2600, FDD2600 and FDD800 bands. According to ZTE, this is the world's first LTE network to use both FDD and TDD at the same time. At the beginning of 2014, 3 Sweden was Sweden's fastest growing mobile operator.|$|E
