40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{normative}} problem of redistribution between agents who can influence their survival probability through private health spending, but who {{differ in their}} attitude towards the risks involved in the lotteries of life to be chosen. For that purpose, a two-period model is developed, where agents' preferences on lotteries of life can be represented by a mean and variance utility function allowing, unlike the expected utility form, some sensitivity to what Allais (Econometrica 21 (4), 503 - 546, 1953) calls the 'dispersion of psychological values'. It is shown that if agents ignore the impact of health spending on the return of their savings, the decentralization of the first-best utilitarian optimum requires intergroup lump sum transfers and group-specific positive taxes on health spending. Under asymmetric information, a <b>differentiated</b> <b>taxation</b> across agents is still required, but subsidizing health spending may be optimal {{as a way to}} solve the incentive problem...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the current {{pesticide}} regulatory system is inefficient. An elaborate set of registration requirements has led to high costs of new pesticides. The current system does not provide any incentives for decreasing its pesticide use. The implementation of financial incentives to control pesticide use is difficult since damage from pesticide use depends on locational factors, timing, and manner of application. An efficient pesticide tax scheme requires detailed monitoring and reporting of pesticide use by farmers. Improved monitoring systems will enable differentiated pesticide taxes according to application technology, and such <b>differentiated</b> <b>taxation</b> will encourage the adoption of precision technologies that reduce pesticide use. Proceeds from pesticide taxes may {{have a role in}} financing research and education in Integrated Pest Management methods, given the high development costs and advanced management skills demanded by many non-chemical control methods. The transition to efficient financial incentives will be gradual in the near future, and it may be useful to use financial incentives to induce improvement in pesticide use efficiency and reduce pesticides use levels...|$|E

40|$|Governments that wish to {{redistribute}} through budgetary policy do so {{mostly on the}} spending side, not on the taxation side of the budget. The taxation side is nevertheless important, partly because less efficient tax structures seem {{to be associated with}} lower taxation and spending levels. Hence political conflicts over spending levels may partly be fought as conflicts over tax structure. The paper provides a coherent perspective on the politics of tax structure. Specific topics include the (ir-) relevance of tax mixes, policy change in income taxation, the importance of tax competition, and the role of political institutions. Wenn der staatliche Haushalt zur Umverteilung genutzt wird, so geschieht dies vor allem auf der Ausgabenseite und nicht auf der Einnahmenseite. Die Einnahmeseite ist trotzdem bedeutsam, weil es offenbar einen Zusammenhang gibt zwischen der Effizienz der Steuerstruktur und dem Steuerniveau. Daraus folgt, dass politische Auseinandersetzungen über Ausgabenniveaus teilweise als Auseinandersetzungen über die Steuerstruktur geführt werden können. Das Papier entwickelt eine kohärente Perspektive zur Analyse von Steuerstrukturpolitik.

50|$|The Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem {{states that}} if {{non-linear}} taxes on earnings are available as policy tool, differential taxation of first- and second period consumption is not optimal if all consumers have preferences weakly separable between consumption and labor. Furthermore, consumers {{need to have}} homogeneous subutility functions of consumption. When applied to capital income taxation, the Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem argues that since present and future consumption are equally complementary to leisure due to weakly separable preferences (and hence there is no Corlett-Hague motive for capital income taxation), capital income taxes do not alleviate the tax distortions caused by labor income taxation while additionally distorting capital income. Thus, capital income <b>taxation,</b> i.e. <b>differentiated</b> consumption <b>taxation,</b> is more costly (and therefore less optimal) than pure non-linear labor income taxation.|$|R

40|$|Argentina {{has a long}} {{record of}} taxing {{agricultural}} exports. In 2013, the European Commission started to impose antidumping duties on exports of Argentinean biodiesel. They were considered being dumped due to reduced export taxes compared to those applied to soybean oil exports. The objective {{of this paper is}} to analyze the economic consequences of these Argen-tinean differential taxes on the European biodiesel and related sectors. Thanks to an original model sim-ulating the world markets of main arable crops, we first analyze the results of an increase of the export tax on biodiesel only. We then simulate the conse-quences of a reduction of export taxes on soybean products. Finally, we assess the impacts of the overall Argentinean policy of <b>differentiated</b> <b>taxation</b> of agri-cultural exports. One main conclusion is that Europe-an biodiesel producers are relatively more penalized than biodiesel producers in other countries by the current Argentinean policy, due to a relatively greater production of rapeseed. US and Brazilian producers suffer from welfare losses in all scenarios due to the indirect effects on soybean markets. The welfare im-pacts on consumers and taxpayers are often opposite to the welfare impacts on producers, leading to small global welfare effects...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examines}} three options for {{ways in which}} a more level playing field between domestic and imported electricity can be achieved. Under the first option, an electricity tax {{is linked to the}} source of electricity, targeting fossil fuel electricity generation. The second option foresees the application of a tax on imported fossil fuel electricity, based on the CO 2 content of the electricity. Under the third option, Switzerland uses import tariffs as an instrument to tax imported fossil fuel electricity. Finally, the study addresses the possibility of taxing imported electricity from nuclear power. The study finds that under WTO law, EU law and the Switzerland–EEC 1972 FTA, it is unlikely that a differential electricity tax will have to be readjusted for imported EU electricity in order {{to take into account the}} costs incurred by EU electricity producers subject to the EU ETS. Furthermore, taxing imported nuclear electricity requires a comprehensive differentiated electricity tax imposed equally on domestic and imported nuclear electricity, both under WTO law and under the Switzerland–EEC 1972 FTA. Moreover, the {{study examines}} the possibility to introduce an import tariff on electricity from fossil fuels or nuclear power. This scenario would require deconsolidation of Swiss tariffs for electricity bound at zero per cent based on production methods according to Art. XXVIII GATT. However, under the Switzerland–EEC 1972 FTA as well as under EU law, imposition of any tariffs on the import of electricity is prohibited and cannot be justified without revoking the Free Trade Agreement. In any case, the implementation of <b>differentiated</b> <b>taxation</b> creates practical problems in all constellations discussed. Currently EU GOs do not contain the necessary information for tracing the exact CO 2 footprint of electricity from fossil fuels, and do not distinguish fossil electricity from nuclear electricity.

They can be achieved through already available technologies and practices, which will not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly, but also generate social, environmental and economic co-benefits. However, progress in the take-up of low-carbon mobility measures substantially lags behind the potential. A number of barriers contribute to this lack of uptake. This paper explores those barriers by focusing on vehicle fuel efficiency in particular, but will also touch on the wider policy framework to improve {{the efficiency of the}} transport sector and reduce emissions. The paper suggests that a combination of fuel pricing, <b>differentiated</b> vehicle <b>taxation,</b> vehicle standards and the provision of modal choice are necessary to minimise rebound effects and significantly curb transport sector greenhouse gas emissions at low- or even negative cost.|$|R
40|$|No final do século XX, as empresas latino-americanas foram inseridas em um ambiente de competitividade internacional - devido à consolidação das reformas neoliberais, o processo de abertura econômica e a estabilização monetária e com isso tornou-se necessário buscar ganhos de produtividade associados à redução de custos. Diante deste cenário e visto que as empresas de micro e pequeno porte sempre tiveram um importante papel nas economias latinas, no que se refere à geração de emprego e renda, o auxílio do Estado por meio de políticas públicas de apoio torna-se fundamental, principalmente no atendimento de suas necessidades mais prementes como o crédito facilitado, tributação diferenciada e capacitação. Assim, o objetivo deste trabalho é analisar, no período de 1998 a 2003, o impacto dessas políticas, mediante uma correlação com as variáveis de desempenho das MPEs número de estabelecimentos e empregos; total de vendas anuais; vendas anuais por empresa e por empregado - no Brasil e no Chile. Para realizar esta análise, inicialmente, recorremos aos autores clássicos do pensamento econômico os quais destacam, diretamente ou indiretamente, questões pertinentes as MPEs. A partir daí, estas são inseridas no cenário econômico latino-americano e então, busca-se delimitá-las nas economias brasileira e chilena, bem como as políticas públicas aplicadas a este porte de empresa. A metodologia utilizada neste trabalho foi de pesquisa bibliográfica e quantitativa. Os métodos de procedimento foram comparativos e estatísticos, tendo como base a técnica de documentação indireta. Como resultado do trabalho pode-se afirmar que é verdadeira a hipótese levantada na pesquisa, ou seja, que as políticas públicas de apoio às MPEs geram impactos positivos no desempenho das empresas na economia.

Like this, the objective of this work is to analyze, in the period from 1998 to 2003, the impact of these politics, by a correlation with the variables of acting of small businesses - number of establishments and jobs; total of annual sales; annual sales for company and for employee - in Brazil and in Chile. To accomplish this analysis, initially, we fell back upon the classic authors of the economical thought which highlight direct or indirectly pertinent subjects small businesses.

As a result of the work, it can be claimed that the hypothesis lifted up in the research is true, in other words, that the public politics of support to the small businesses generate positive impacts in the acting of the companies in the economy...|$|E
40|$|Optimal tax {{theory has}} shown that, under weak assumptions, {{indirect}} taxation such as production subsidies, tariffs, or <b>differentiated</b> commodity <b>taxation,</b> are sub-optimal and that redistribution should be achieved solely with the direct income tax. However, these important results of optimal tax theory, namely production efficiency and uniform commodity taxation under non-linear income taxation, {{have been shown}} to break down when labor taxation is based on income only and when there is imperfect substitution of labor types in the production function. These results in favor of indirect tax instruments are valid in the short-run when skills are exogenous and individuals cannot move from occupation to occupation. In the long-run, it is more realistic to assume that individuals choose their occupation based on the relative after-tax rewards. This paper shows that, in that context, production efficiency and the uniform commodity tax result are restored. Therefore, in a long-run context, direct income taxation should be preferred to indirect tax instruments to raise revenue and achieve redistribution. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a new framework {{for evaluating the}} welfare effects of commodity tax reforms. It is shown that tax reforms are welfare improving {{if and only if}} they satisfy the following intuitive property: on average, consumer prices fall for commodities with high marginal excess burdens. The rule is then applied to analyze a shift from <b>differentiated</b> commodity <b>taxation</b> to direct flat-rate taxation of labour income. The welfare impact of such reforms can be decomposed into two effects: (i) the increase in welfare associated with substitution among taxed commodities, and (ii) the loss in welfare associated with substitution between commodities and leisure. On balance, a shift towards direct taxation is desirable when inter-commodity substitution effects are large relative to commodity–leisure substitution effects. The analysis allows us to reconcile the apparently conflicting results of the tax reform and optimal taxation literatures.
