5|$|An {{alternative}} {{suggestion was}} that the comets were all fragments of an earlier Sun-grazing comet. This idea was first proposed in 1880, and its plausibility was amply demonstrated when the <b>Great</b> Comet of 1882 broke up into several fragments after its perihelion passage. In 1888, Heinrich Kreutz published a paper showing that the comets of 1843 (C/1843 D1, the <b>Great</b> March Comet), 1880 (C/1880 C1, the <b>Great</b> Southern Comet), and 1882 (C/1882 R1, <b>Great</b> September Comet) were probably fragments of a giant comet that had broken up several orbits before. The comet of 1680 proved to be unrelated to this family of comets.|$|E

40|$|The {{profiles}} of four analogues of idazoxan {{have been examined}} at alpha-adrenoceptors and the results compared to those obtained with idazoxan and yohimbine. The compounds possessed either a methyl (RX 801079), ethyl (RX 811033), n-propyl (RX 811054) or isopropenyl (RX 811005) group at the two position of idazoxan. The rank order of antagonist potency against UK- 14, 304 at prejunctional alpha 2 -adrenoceptors of the rat isolated vas deferens was RX 811054 <b>greater</b> than RX 811033 <b>greater</b> than idazoxan <b>greater</b> than RX 811005 <b>greater</b> than yohimbine = RX 801079. All compounds were competitive antagonists. The rank order of antagonist potency against noradrenaline at postjunctional alpha 1 -adrenoceptors of the rat isolated anococcygeus muscle was RX 811054 = RX 811033 = idazoxan = yohimbine <b>greater</b> than RX 811005 = RX 801079. All compounds were competitive antagonists. The rank order of alpha-adrenoceptor selectivity (alpha 2 /alpha 1) was RX 811005 <b>greater</b> than RX 801079 <b>greater</b> than RX 811054 <b>greater</b> than RX 811033 <b>greater</b> than idazoxan <b>greater</b> than yohimbine. In pithed rats, intravenous administration of all compounds fully reversed the prejunctional alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist effects of clonidine and guanabenz on electrically-induced contractions of the vas deferens and anococcygeus muscle respectively. In pithed rats the rank order of antagonist potency against UK- 14, 304 at cardiac prejunctional alpha 2 -adrenoceptors was RX 811054 <b>greater</b> than RX 811033 <b>greater</b> than idazoxan <b>greater</b> than yohimbine <b>greater</b> than RX 811005 <b>greater</b> than RX 801079. In contrast, the rank order of antagonist potency against cirazoline pressor effects (vascular postjunctional alpha 1 -adrenoceptors) was RX 811054 <b>greater</b> than RX 811033 <b>greater</b> than yohimbine <b>greater</b> than idazoxan <b>greater</b> than RX 811005 <b>greater</b> than RX 801079. The rank order of alpha 2 -adrenoceptor selectivity was RX 811033 = RX 801079 = RX 801005 <b>greater</b> than RX 811054 <b>greater</b> than idazoxan <b>greater</b> than yohimbine. Although idazoxan produced contractions of the anococcygeus muscle and increased blood pressure in pithed rats, three of the analogues (RX 811005, RX 801079 and RX 811033) were inactive. In conclusion, alkyl substitution in the 2 -position of idazoxan can enhance either alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist potency or selectivity or both and furthermore, the weak partial alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonist properties of idazoxan can be removed...|$|R
