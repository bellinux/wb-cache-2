25|$|The only {{currency}} {{strong enough}} to meet the rising demands for <b>international</b> <b>currency</b> transactions was the U.S. dollar. The strength of the U.S. economy, the fixed relationship of the dollar to gold ($35 an ounce), and {{the commitment of the}} U.S. government to convert dollars into gold at that price made the dollar as good as gold. In fact, the dollar was even better than gold: it earned interest and it was more flexible than gold.|$|E
25|$|In July 1944, {{before the}} {{conclusion}} of World War II, delegates from the 44 allied nations gathered in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, United States, to reestablish and regulate the international financial systems. The meeting resulted in {{the founding of the}} International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and was followed by other post-war reconstruction efforts, such as establishing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The IMF was charged with the maintenance of a system of <b>international</b> <b>currency</b> exchange rates which became known as the Bretton Woods system.|$|E
25|$|The {{shift toward}} a more pluralistic {{distribution}} of economic power led to increasing dissatisfaction with the privileged role of the U.S. dollar as the <b>international</b> <b>currency.</b> As in effect the world's central banker, the U.S., through its deficit, determined the level of international liquidity. In an increasingly interdependent world, U.S. policy greatly influenced economic conditions in Europe and Japan.

25|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, Peru's <b>international</b> <b>currency</b> {{reserves}} {{were built}} up from nearly zero at the end of García's term to almost US$10 billion. Fujimori also left a smaller state bureaucracy and reduced government expenses (in contrast to the historical pattern of bureaucratic expansion), a technically minded (but widely perceived as politicized) administration of public entities like SUNAT (the tax collection agency), a large number of new schools (not only in Lima but in Peru's small towns), more roads and highways, and new and upgraded communications infrastructure. These improvement led to the revival of tourism, agroexport, industries and fisheries.|$|E
25|$|In 1944 at Bretton Woods, as {{a result}} of the {{collective}} conventional wisdom of the time, representatives from all the leading allied nations collectively favored a regulated system of fixed exchange rates, indirectly disciplined by a US dollar tied to gold—a system that relied on a regulated market economy with tight controls on the values of currencies. Flows of speculative international finance were curtailed by shunting them through and limiting them via central banks. This meant that international flows of investment went into foreign direct investment (FDI)—i.e., construction of factories overseas, rather than <b>international</b> <b>currency</b> manipulation or bond markets. Although the national experts disagreed to some degree on the specific implementation of this system, all agreed on the need for tight controls.|$|E
25|$|The ransom of {{one million}} rixdollars was the {{equivalent}} in value of four year's of Swedish harvests.

Most of the rixdollars were obtained by selling Swedish copper on the international market, but the government also had to take Dutch loans of altogether 250,000 rixdollars. In the end Sweden managed to pay the ransom. The payment was financed by a severe extra tax paid during six years by almost all persons above the age of 15, including the royalty and the nobility. The only exempts were the tenants of noble seat farms, and active duty soldiers. The Danes had hoped that Sweden {{would not be able}} to pay, thereby losing its outlet to the Atlantic.|$|E

25|$|Platinum coins are {{a form of}} currency. Platinum has an <b>international</b> <b>currency</b> symbol under ISO 4217 of XPT. The {{issues of}} {{legitimate}} platinum coins were initiated by Spain in Spanish-colonized America in the 18th century and continued by the Russian Empire in the 19th century. As a form of currency, these coins proved to be impractical: platinum resembles many less expensive metals, and, unlike the more malleable and ductile silver and gold, {{it is very difficult}} to work. Several commemorative coin sets have been issued starting from 1978 and became popular among coin collectors. The major platinum bullion coins include the American Platinum Eagle, the Canadian Platinum Maple Leaf, the Australian Platinum Koala, the Isle of Man Noble, the Chinese Platinum Panda and several series by the Soviet Union and later by the Russian Federation.|$|E
25|$|Reinforcing the {{relative}} decline in U.S. {{power and the}} dissatisfaction of Europe and Japan with the system was the continuing decline of the dollar—the foundation that had underpinned the post-1945 global trading system. The Vietnam War and the refusal of the administration of U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson {{to pay for it}} and its Great Society programs through taxation resulted in an increased dollar outflow to pay for the military expenditures and rampant inflation, which led to the deterioration of the U.S. balance of trade position. In the late 1960s, the dollar was overvalued with its current trading position, while the German Mark and the yen were undervalued; and, naturally, the Germans and the Japanese had no desire to revalue and thereby make their exports more expensive, whereas the U.S. sought to maintain its international credibility by avoiding devaluation. Meanwhile, the pressure on government reserves was intensified by the new <b>international</b> <b>currency</b> markets, with their vast pools of speculative capital moving around in search of quick profits.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Edgar L. Feige {{proposed}} a synthesis and {{extension of the}} ideas of Keynes and Tobin by proposing a flat rate tax on all transactions. The total volume of all transactions undertaken in an economy represents the broadest possible tax base and therefore requires the lowest flat tax rate to raise any requisite amount of revenue. Since financial transactions in stocks, bonds, <b>international</b> <b>currency</b> transactions and derivatives comprise most of the automated payment transaction (APT) tax base, it is in essence the broadest of financial transaction taxes. Initially {{proposed a}}s a revenue neutral replacement for the entire Federal tax system of the United States, it could alternatively {{be considered as a}} global tax whose revenues could be used by national governments to reduce existing income, corporate and VAT tax rates as well as reducing existing sovereign debt burdens. If adopted by all of the developed nations, it would have the advantage of eliminating all incentives for substitution between financial assets and between financial centers since all transactions would universally be taxed at the identical flat tax rate.|$|E

2500|$|Dooley, Folkerts-Landau and Garber have {{referred}} to the monetary system of today as Bretton Woods II.

The backlash of high government debt levels on monetary policy making is argued to lead to the hysteresis of low interest rates and high government debt levels. In this context, monetary reform is discussed with respect to the exit from low interest rates and high debt policies and a reform of the prevalent world monetary system.
