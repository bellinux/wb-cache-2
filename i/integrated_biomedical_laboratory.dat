40|$|This paper {{describes}} a distributed collaborative effort between industry and academia to systematize data management {{in an academic}} <b>biomedical</b> <b>laboratory.</b> Heterogeneous and voluminous nature of research data created in <b>biomedical</b> <b>laboratories</b> make information management difficult and research unproductive. One such collaborative effort was evaluated {{over a period of}} four years using data collection methods including ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, web-based surveys, progress reports, conference call summaries, and face-to-face group discussions. Data were analyzed using qualitative methods of data analysis to (1) characterize specific problems faced by biomedical researchers with traditional information management practices, (2) identify intervention areas to introduce a new research information management system called Labmatrix, and finally to (3) evaluate and delineate important general collaboration (intervention) characteristics that can optimize outcomes of an implementation process in <b>biomedical</b> <b>laboratories.</b> Results emphasize the importance of end user perseverance, human-centric interoperability evaluation, and demonstration of return on investment of effort and time of laboratory members and industry personnel for success of implementation process. In addition, there is an intrinsic learning component associated with the implementation process of an information management system. Technology transfer experience in a complex environment such as the <b>biomedical</b> <b>laboratory</b> can be eased with use of information systems that support human and cognitive interoperability. Such informatics features can also contribute to successful collaboration and hopefully to scientific productivity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- To utilize {{dispersed}} information {{effectively in}} Omics medicine that {{stands on a}} massive amount of Clinical Omics information, the first hurdle to overcome {{is to establish a}} social IT infrastructure that has Electronic Health Record (EHR) and <b>integrated</b> <b>biomedical</b> database with standardized technologies derived from HL 7 /CEN/ISO. In preparation for Omics Medicine, Japan started the <b>Integrated</b> <b>biomedical</b> database project as a National project of Japan on 2007. This project tries to establish semantic integration, semantic navigation, and semantic interoperability with the Clinical Omics ontology which integrates clinical ontology and omics ontology.

40|$|In 1984, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in {{consultation}} with experts from academic institutions, industry, and government, published the book Biosafety in Microbiological and <b>Biomedical</b> <b>Laboratories</b> ("Guidelines") [Richardson JH, Barkley WE, eds. Biosafety in microbiological and <b>biomedical</b> <b>laboratories,</b> 1984. Washington, DC: Public Health Service, 1984; DHHS publication no. (CDC) 84 - 8395. ]. These Guidelines are based on combinations of standard and special practices, equipment, and facilities recommended for use in working with infectious agents in various laboratory settings. The recommendations are advisory; they provide a general code for operating microbiologic and <b>biomedical</b> <b>laboratories.</b> One section of the Guidelines is devoted to standard and special microbiologic practices, safety equipment, and facilities for biosafety levels (BSL) 1 through 4. Another section contains specific agent summary statements, each consisting of {{a brief description of}} laboratory-associated infections, the nature of laboratory hazards, and recommended precautions for working with the causative agent. The authors realized that the discovery of the availability of information about these agents would necessitate updating the agent summary. Such a statement for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (called HTLV-III/LAV when the Guidelines were published) was published in MMWR in 1986 [CDC. Human T-lymphotropic virus type III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus agent summary statement. MMWR 1986; 35 : 540 - 2, 547 - 9].
