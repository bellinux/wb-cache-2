25|$|Sulfatide shows {{involvement}} in HIV-1 infection. gp120-gp41 are {{specific types of}} <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> complexes that are found on HIV-1. These glycoprotein complexes can interact with CD4, a viral receptor molecule, which induces {{a change in the}} conformation of gp120. This change in conformation allows the gp120 complex to interact with the chemokine co-receptor and the insertion of the fusion peptide, gp41, into the membrane of the host cell. This allows the HIV-1 virus to enter into the cell. Gp120 can also bind to glycolipids like sulfatide and galactocerebroside (GalCer). Sulfatide binds strongly to the V3 loop of gp120, which does not interact with CD4. Consequently, sulfatide acts as an alternate virus receptor in CD4- cells, and it participates in transmembrane signaling. However, sulfatide has little function in HIV-1 infection of CD4+ cells.|$|E
25|$|Galectin-1 {{has been}} shown to enhance HIV {{infection}} due to its galactose binding specificity. HIV preferentially infects CD4+ T cells and other cells of the immune system, immobilising the adaptive immune system. HIV is a virus that infects CD4+ cells via binding of its viral <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> complex, which consists of gp120 and gp41. The gp120 glycoprotein contains two types of N-glycan, high mannose oligomers and N-acetyllactosamine chains on a trimannose core. The high mannose oligomers are pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) and are recognised by the C-type lectin DC-SIGN found on dendritic cells. The N-acetyllactosamine chains are ligands for galectin-1. Galectin-1 is expressed in the thymus. In particular it is secreted in abundance by Th1 cells. In its normal function, galectin-1 binds to glycans on the CD4 co-receptor of T cells to prevent auto reactivity. When HIV is present, the galectin bridges between the CD4 co-receptor and gp120 ligands, thus facilitating HIV infection of the T cell. Galectin-1 is not essential for HIV infection but assists it by accelerating the binding kinetics between gp120 and CD4. Knowledge of the mechanism between galectin and HIV may provide important therapeutic opportunities. A galectin-1 inhibitor can be used in conjunction with antiretroviral drugs to decrease the infectivity of the HIV and increase the efficacy of the drug.|$|E

25|$|Their {{life cycle}} {{is thought to}} begin with a virion {{attaching}} to specific cell-surface receptors such as C-type lectins, DC-SIGN, or integrins, which is followed by fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. The virions taken up by the cell then travel to acidic endosomes and lysosomes where the viral <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoprotein</b> GP is cleaved. This processing appears to allow the virus to bind to cellular proteins enabling it to fuse with internal cellular membranes and release the viral nucleocapsid. The Ebolavirus structural glycoprotein (known as GP1,2) is responsible for the virus' ability to bind to and infect targeted cells. The viral RNA polymerase, encoded by the L gene, partially uncoats the nucleocapsid and transcribes the genes into positive-strand mRNAs, which are then translated into structural and nonstructural proteins. The most abundant protein produced is the nucleoprotein, whose concentration in the host cell determines when L switches from gene transcription to genome replication. Replication of the viral genome results in full-length, positive-strand antigenomes that are, in turn, transcribed into genome copies of negative-strand virus progeny. Newly synthesized structural proteins and genomes self-assemble and accumulate near the inside of the cell membrane. Virions bud off from the cell, gaining their envelopes from the cellular membrane from which they bud. The mature progeny particles then infect other cells to repeat the cycle. The genetics of the Ebola virus are difficult to study because of EBOV's virulent characteristics.|$|E

Because HCV pseudotype particles contain fully functional <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins,</b> these <b>envelope</b> proteins, or at least a fraction of them, should be in a mature conformation similar to that on the native HCV particles.

40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) gp 120 exterior and gp 41 transmembrane <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> assemble into trimers on the virus surface that represent potential targets for antibodies. Potent neutralizing antibodies bind the monomeric gp 120 glycoprotein with small changes in entropy, whereas unusually large decreases in entropy accompany gp 120 binding by soluble CD 4 and less potent neutralizing antibodies. The high degree of conformational flexibility in the free gp 120 molecule implied by these observations has been suggested to contribute to masking the trimer from antibodies that recognize the gp 120 receptor-binding regions. Here we use cross-linking and recognition by antibodies to investigate the conformational states of gp 120 monomers and soluble and cell surface forms of the trimeric HIV- 1 <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins.</b> The fraction of monomeric and trimeric <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> able to be recognized after fixation was inversely related to the entropic changes associated with ligand binding.

2500|$|<b>Envelope</b> <b>{{glycoprotein}}</b> GP120 (or gp120) is a glycoprotein exposed on {{the surface}} of the HIV envelope.

Gp120 is essential for virus entry into cells as it plays a vital role in attachment to specific cell surface receptors. These receptors are DC-SIGN, Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycan and a specific interaction with the CD4 receptor, particularly on helper T-cells. Binding to CD4 induces the start of a cascade of conformational changes in gp120 and gp41 that lead to the fusion of the viral with the host cell membrane. Binding to CD4 is mainly electrostatic although there are van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds.|$|E

We found that each chimeric envelope construct had a cell surface-specific pattern of expression {{similar to that of the}} parental <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> corresponding to the gp 41. Thus, the difference in cell surface expression observed between TCLA viruses and various PI is probably due to a signal located in gp 41. Identification of this signal may be important for the design of PI envelope-derived immunogens and may increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which HIV- 1 escapes from the immune system...|$|R
40|$|Several {{members of}} the {{chemokine}} receptor family have recently been identified as coreceptors, with CD 4, for entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) into target cells. In this report, we show that the <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> of several strains of HIV- 2 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) employ the same chemokine receptors for infection. <b>Envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> from HIV- 2 use CCR 5 or CXCR 4, while those from several strains of SIV use CCR 5. Our data indicate also that some viral envelopes can use more than one coreceptor for entry and suggest {{that some of these}} coreceptors remain to be identified. To further understand how different envelope molecules use CCR 5 as an entry cofactor, we show that soluble purified <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> (SU component) from CCR 5 -tropic HIV- 1, HIV- 2, and SIV can compete for binding of iodinated chemokine to CCR 5. The competition is dependent on binding of the SU glycoprotein to cell surface CD 4 and implies a direct interaction between <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> and CCR 5. This interaction is specific since it is not observed with SU glycoprotein from a CXCR 4 -tropic virus or with a chemokine receptor that is not competent for viral entry (CCR 1). For HIV- 1, the interaction can be inhibited by antibodies specific for the V 3 loop of SU. Soluble CD 4 was found to potentiate binding of the HIV- 2 ST and SIVmac 239 <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> to CCR 5, suggesting that a CD 4 -induced conformational change in SU is required for subsequent binding to CCR 5.

Treatment of target PBMCs with an antibody against LFA- 1, a principal ICAM- 1 receptor, was able to nullify the ICAM- 1 -mediated enhancement. The incorporation of ICAM- 1 rendered HIV- 1 virions less susceptible to neutralization by a monoclonal antibody directed against the viral <b>envelope</b> <b>glycoproteins.</b> Surprisingly, an antibody against ICAM- 1 completely neutralized infection by ICAM- 1 -containing viruses, reducing the efficiency of virus entry by almost 100 -fold. Thus, HIV- 1 neutralization by an ICAM- 1 -directed antibody involves more than an inhibition of the contribution of ICAM- 1 to virus entry...|$|R
