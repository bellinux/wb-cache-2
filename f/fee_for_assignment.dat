The main questions of the study have been: What is the social services recruitment policy of foster carers? What is a good foster home and how it is being determined? What would be useful to make fostering attractive for younger carers and how to find them? The study has been selected six respondents (five social workers and one foster family) strategically from different municipalities in Gothenburg. Qualitative method has been used to conduct the study and semi-structured interview has been used to collect empirical data from the respondents. The findings of the study show that In Sweden foster care is considered as an assignment, it is not an employment.

Foster carers are recruited by the guideline of Swedish law, the Social Services Act and the Care of Young Persons Act...|$|R
40|$|Consultant {{pre-selection}} is {{an essential}} process to distinguish capable candidates before they are invited to submit their technical and <b>fee</b> proposals <b>for</b> consultancy <b>assignments.</b> Despite that, many clients have their own criteria and emphasis, and this could result in discrepancies in pre-selection decisions. The aim {{of this paper is}} to devise a more objective framework for evaluating consultants' general capabilities during the pre-selection process. The paper begins by identifying the commonly used criteria for pre-selecting engineering consultants. In order to examine the importance of consultant pre-selection criteria (CPC), a questionnaire survey has been conducted with clients who are responsible for pre-selecting their consultants; and consultants being pre-selected by the clients. The findings reveal that the perception of the client and consultant groups on the importance of CPC was very consistent. Finally, a multi-criteria model for evaluating consultants' general capabilities during the pre-selection is proposed. Based on each candidate score, clients can determine which engineering consultants should be invited to bid <b>for</b> a consultancy <b>assignment.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|To {{what degree}} are audit <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> U. S. firms with {{publicly}} traded equity higher than <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> otherwise similar firms with private equity? The answer is potentially important for evaluating regulatory regime design efficiency and for understanding audit demand and production economics. For U. S. firms with publicly traded debt, we hold constant the regulatory regime, including mandated issuer reporting and auditor responsibilities. We vary equity ownership and thus public securities market contextual factors, including any related public firm audit fees from increased audit {{effort to reduce}} audit litigation risk and/or pure litigation risk premium (litigation channel effects). In cross-section, we find that audit <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> public equity firms are 20 - 22 % higher than <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> otherwise similar private equity firms. Time-series comparisons for firms that change ownership status yield larger percentage <b>fee</b> increases (decreases) <b>for</b> those going public (private). Results are consistent with litigation channel effects giving rise to substantial incremental audit <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> U. S. firms with public equity ownership...|$|R
