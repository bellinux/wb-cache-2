The 1879 team participated <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> game, {{which resulted in a}} scoreless tie. It was played against the Baltimore Athletic Club, at most likely an unused drill field on the Naval Academy campus. Navy would not field a football team in 1880 or 1881, likely {{due to the lack of}} support.|$|E

About one-third of Berrios’ campaign contributions in that decade came from the 15 property tax appeal law firms that gained the most for their clients between 2006 and 2008, contributing almost $1 million to six political action committees controlled by Berrios and his daughter, Illinois State Representative Maria Antonia Berrios, Democrat of the 39th Illinois House district on Chicago's northwest side. Berrios started 2008 with $1.2 million <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> of his several campaign funds, much of it from attorneys who appeared before him.|$|E

The prices of spinach, cabbage, and lettuce rose by 124%, 72%, and 26% respectively <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> day.

Kershaw pitched a no-hitter on June 18, 2014, becoming the 22nd Dodger to do so. Being a left-handed strikeout pitcher and playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Kershaw has often been compared to Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax.

5|$|Oda {{also made}} constitutions, or rules, for his clergy. His Constitutions of Oda {{are the first}} {{surviving}} constitutions of a 10th-century English ecclesiastical reformer.

The work is extant <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> surviving manuscript, British Museum Cotton Vespasian A XIV, folios 175v to 177v. This is an 11th-century copy done for Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July, the 169th Division {{reached the}} town of Kayraly, but was thrown back by strong Soviet counterattacks. All three Soviet {{divisions}} now formed a formidable defense line around Kayraly, incorporating the adjacent lakes Apa and Kuola into their defense. The German advance stalled, facing difficulties with arctic forest fighting. At {{the same time the}} Soviets managed to bring additional reinforcements to replace their losses. On 16 July, Falkenhorst arrived at the XXXVI Corps' headquarters and pressured Feige to renew the offensive. Feige relented and on 27 and 29 July the corps made two additional attacks separately against the Soviets which led to nothing. A stalemate had developed at the front line that the Germans could not break. Due the grim situation, and mounting losses (5,500 men <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> month), AOK Norwegen finally ordered Feige to halt the offensive.|$|E
