5|$|As Leader of the Opposition, Douglas-Home persuaded Macleod and Powell {{to rejoin}} the Conservative front bench. Within weeks of the general {{election}} Butler retired from politics, accepting the post of Master of Trinity College, Cambridge together with a life peerage. Douglas-Home did not immediately allocate shadow portfolios to his colleagues, but in January 1965 he gave Maudling the foreign affairs brief and Heath became spokesman on Treasury and economic affairs. There was no immediate pressure for Douglas-Home {{to hand over the}} leadership to a member of the younger generation, but by early 1965 a new Conservative group called PEST (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism) had discreetly begun to call for a change. Douglas-Home either did not know, or chose to <b>ignore,</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Heath had made a donation to PEST. He decided that the time was coming for him to retire as leader, with Heath as his preferred successor.|$|E

25|$|We cannot <b>ignore</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{thousands}} of Chechen civilians {{have died and}} more than 200,000 have been driven from their homes. Together with other delegations, we have expressed our alarm at the persistent, credible reports of human rights violations by Russian forces in Chechnya, including extrajudicial killings. There are also reports that Chechen separatists have committed abuses, including the killing of civilians and prisoners.... The war in Chechnya has greatly damaged Russia's international standing and is isolating Russia from the international community. Russia's work to repair that damage, {{both at home and}} abroad, or its choice to risk further isolating itself, is the most immediate and momentous challenge that Russia faces.|$|E
25|$|The first council {{did not end}} the conflict. When Emperor Constantine I was baptized, the baptism was {{performed}} by an Arian bishop and relative, Eusebius of Nicomedia. Also the charges of Christian corruption by Constantine (see the Constantinian shift) <b>ignore</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Constantine deposed Athanasius of Alexandria and later restored Arius, who had been branded a heresiarch by the Nicene Council. After his death, Constantine I was succeeded by two Arian Emperors Constantius II (son of Constantine I) and Valens. It {{was not until the}} co-reigns of Gratian and Theodosius that Arianism was effectively wiped out among the ruling class and elite of the Eastern Empire. Theodosius' wife St Flacilla was instrumental in his campaign to end Arianism. This later culminated into the killing of some 300,000 Orthodox Christians at the hands of Arians in Milan in 538AD.|$|E
25|$|By 2009, 27 coffeeshops selling {{cannabis}} in Rotterdam, {{all within}} 200 metres from schools, must close down. This is {{nearly half of}} the coffeeshops that currently operate within its municipality. This is due to the new policy of city mayor Ivo Opstelten and the town council. The higher levels of the active ingredient in cannabis in Netherlands create a growing opposition to the traditional Dutch view of cannabis as a relatively innocent soft drug. Supporters of coffeeshops state that such claims are often exaggerated and <b>ignore</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> higher content means a user needs to use less of the plant to get the desired effects, making it in effect safer. Dutch research has however shown that an increase of THC content also increase the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content. Closing of coffeeshops is not unique for Rotterdam. Many other towns have done the same in the last 10 years.|$|E

25|$|Another problem (also {{compounded}} {{by the absence of}} implementing legislation) is the apparent lack of understanding by many judges in Mexico of the law of the Convention. Mexican judges frequently seem to <b>ignore</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a case before them arises out of a return application under the Convention, and instead simply apply the procedural and substantive law that would govern a Mexican custody dispute. The result is almost always that those courts deny return without evaluating the merits of the application under the law of the Convention. U.S. Embassy officials report that the Mexican Central Authority has taken some preliminary steps to address this problem. The Mexican Central Authority actively participated in June 2003 in a conference hosted by the U.S. Embassy to educate family law judges about the Hague Convention. The Mexican Central Authority has also started to contact judges it believes may be presiding over a Convention case {{for the first time to}} provide support and guidance, and, in particular, to emphasize the distinction between the court's role in Convention cases and its role in domestic custody determinations.|$|E
25|$|In March 1918, George's {{father was}} exiled to the remote city of Perm by the Bolsheviks, and Natalia became {{concerned}} for her family's safety. She {{turned to her}} friends, Prince and Princess Putyatin, for help. The Putyatins' apartment in Saint Petersburg was {{next door to the}} Danish embassy, and the Danes agreed to surreptitiously smuggle George out of the country. The Danish diplomat overseeing prisoner-of-war exchange, Colonel Cramer, gave George and his nanny, Miss Neame, shelter at his home in Sergeyevskaya street for a month until 25 April. On a train carrying prisoners-of-war who were being repatriated back to Germany, and with false passports in the name of Silldorff, Miss Neame posed as the wife of an Austrian officer and George posed as her son. A Danish officer, Captain Sorensen, accompanied them, since neither spoke German, and if they were discovered Miss Neame was in danger of being shot as a spy. They reached the Danish embassy in Berlin safely, and were given shelter by the ambassador, Count Carl Moltke. Informed of their escape, Wilhelm II, German Emperor, chose to <b>ignore</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the British Miss Neame was an enemy alien, and permitted them to continue their journey to Copenhagen.|$|E
25|$|Even though Malta {{acquired}} independence, {{there was}} an ongoing presence of continuity. One {{of them is the}} monarchy pre-1964 and prior 1964. The Malta Independence Order 1964 was subject to the Malta Independence Act of that same year and it is a document that holds the chief regulations that govern the constitution of a state. This document is supreme over each and every other document and all legislation is subject to it. Throughout Malta's constitutional history, the nation acquired its own constitution, and to a certain extent, the Independence Constitution is made up of certain principles that arose {{for the first time in}} previous constitutions. It can be said that the Independence Constitution has evolved from the constitution which preceded it. But one must not <b>ignore</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> changes have taken place in this process of evolution. The statement that the 1964 constitution is in fact a replica of the 1961 constitution with sovereignty added might be criticised by saying that some factors differ between the two constitutions. The 1964 constitution is not merely what can be defined as an improvement. It is more like another stepping-stone in constitutional history being the final step in a long series of constitutions. In fact, even though it may seem that some provisions were altered from the 1961 constitution to the 1964 constitution, some of those provisions remained unchanged until the amendments of the 1964 constitution were made. On 14 April 2014, the anti-discrimination provision of constitution is amended to include sexual orientation and gender identity.|$|E

The bluespotted stingray is generally fished for its meat, being either smoked and salted or dried for local markets, but inexpensive due to its small size. It is caught in mass in bottom trawl, trammel, and fish traps. The bluespotted stingray is very venomous and it has a barb approximately [...] long. [...] The venom contains serotonin, 5' nucleotidase, and phosphodiesterase.|$|E
500|$|From {{its early}} days, {{there has been}} {{criticism}} of Palsgraf, and more recently, of Cardozo for authoring it. Cowan, writing in 1938, described its holding as limited to its facts, that given the identical circumstances recurring, the railroad would breach no duty to the new plaintiff by assisting a man with such a package in boarding. Prosser in his 1953 article wondered [...] "how can any rule as to the 'scope of the risk' evolved from two guards, a package of fireworks and a scale aid in the slightest degree in the solution of this question? Is it proper, in Palsgraf itself, so utterly to <b>ignore</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the plaintiff was a passenger... until the question is decided, is Palsgraf really definite authority even for Palsgraf?" ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{independence}} in 1921, {{there was no}} state encouragement to develop the mercantile marine. [...] "Our new leaders seemed to turn their backs upon the sea and to <b>ignore</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> we are an island". Each year the fleet declined. In 1923, the merchant fleet consisted of 127 ships. This number dropped every year until 1939 when, {{at the start of}} World War II, the fleet numbered only 56 ships. Only 5% of imports were carried on Irish flagged vessels. There were several reasons for this decline: a consequence of the war of independence, a policy of self-sufficiency, the economic depression, the lack of investment and government neglect. Foreign ships, on which Ireland had hitherto depended, were withdrawn. [...] "In the period April 1941 and June 1942 only seven such ships visited the country".|$|E

Manson later dismissed claims that his work inspired the murder, arguing instead that [...] "the education that parents give their children and the influences they receive" [...] plays a more direct role in violent behavior, and criticised media who attempted to [...] " [...] the blame elsewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{anthropologist}} Murphy Pizza {{suggests that}} Heathenry {{can be understood}} as an example of what the historian Eric Hobsbawm termed an [...] "invented tradition". As the religious studies scholar Fredrik Gregorius states, despite the fact that [...] "no real continuity" [...] exists between Heathenry and the pre-Christian belief systems of Germanic Europe, Heathen practitioners often dislike being considered adherents of a [...] "new religion" [...] and [...] "modern invention" [...] and thus prefer to depict theirs as a [...] "traditional faith". Many practitioners avoid using the scholarly, [...] term [...] "reconstructionism" [...] to describe their practices, preferring to characterize it as an [...] "indigenous religion" [...] with parallels to the traditional belief systems of the world's indigenous peoples. In claiming a sense of indigeneity, many Heathens—particularly in the United States—attempt to frame themselves as the victims of Medieval Christian colonialism and imperialism. Snook, Thad Horrell, and Kirsten Horton argued that in doing so, these Heathens <b>ignore</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> most of them are white, and thus members of the same ethnic community which has perpetrated and benefitted from colonial and imperial policies against indigenous communities in the Americas and elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|Lucy Popescu of CineVue {{called the}} film [...] "a {{powerful}} {{indictment of the}} global trade in human beings and the abuse of vulnerable people," [...] but criticized the film for focusing on human trafficking victims, arguing that the perpetrators should have been dealt with more prominently. She commended Bilheimer on the few interviews with traffickers that he did include, but she condemned as inadequate the [...] "only passing reference {{to the thousands of}} men who engage in sexual tourism, like those who travel to Cambodia to 'buy' traumatized children who they can then abuse for weeks at a time." [...] Popescu also called the film [...] "simplistic", arguing that it should have more clearly expressed that sex trafficking victims are not able to provide legitimate consent for sexual activity because they are afraid that their lives might be in danger if they do not comply. John Rash of the Star Tribune called the film [...] "a cacophony of concerned voices speaking about a modern-day scourge." [...] Rash praised the film for its global scope, but suggested that this geographical breadth allows American audiences to <b>ignore</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the trafficking of children is prevalent in the United States and not just in other countries.|$|E

500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I think might benefit from an extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I love the way it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to <b>ignore</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E
