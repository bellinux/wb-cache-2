40|$|Partial, {{unilateral}} nigrostriatal lesions {{of varying}} severity were produced in rats by injecting graded doses of 6 -hydroxydopamine into the substantia nigra. Formation of the dopamine metabolites <b>dihydroxyphenylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and homovanillic acid in each surviving nigrostriatal neuron (estimated by {{the ratios of}} <b>dihydroxyphenylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> to dopamine and homovanillic acid to dopamine in the striatum) increased significantly when dopamine concentrations in striata containing lesions {{had been reduced to}} 25 % or less of control values, but remained unchanged in rats with less severe lesions. These findings suggest that, in rats with severe damage of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, surviving neurons increase their firing rates and accelerate dopamine synthesis and release. In rats that had lesions and enhanced striatal dopamine release, but not in rats with lesser lesions (i. e., which reduced ipsilateral dopamine concentrations by less than 75 %), administration of tyrosine (250 mg/kg) caused further significant increases in formation of <b>dihydroxyphenylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and homovanillic acid.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} virgin olive oil phenolic compounds (PC) alone or in combination with thyme PC on blood lipid profile from hypercholesterolemic humans, and whether the changes generated are related with changes in gut microbiota populations and activities. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover human trial (n = 12) was carried out. Participants ingested 25 mL/day for 3 weeks, preceded by 2 -week washout periods, three raw virgin olive oils differing in the concentration and origin of PC: (1) a virgin olive oil (OO) naturally containing 80 mg PC/kg, (VOO), (2) a PC-enriched virgin olive oil containing 500 mg PC/kg, from OO (FVOO), and (3) a PC-enriched virgin olive oil containing a mixture of 500 mg PC/kg from OO and thyme, 1 : 1 (FVOOT). Blood lipid values and faecal quantitative changes in microbial populations, short chain fatty acids, cholesterol microbial metabolites, bile acids, and phenolic metabolites were analysed. RESULTS: FVOOT decreased seric ox-LDL concentrations compared with pre-FVOOT, and increased numbers of bifidobacteria and the levels of the phenolic metabolite protocatechuic acid compared to VOO (P < 0. 05). FVOO {{did not lead to}} changes in blood lipid profile nor quantitative changes in the microbial populations analysed, but increased the coprostanone compared to FVOOT (P < 0. 05), and the levels of the faecal hydroxytyrosol and <b>dihydroxyphenylacetic</b> <b>acids,</b> compared with pre-intervention values and to VOO, respectively (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The ingestion of a PC-enriched virgin olive oil, containing a mixture of olive oil and thyme PC for 3 weeks, decreases blood ox-LDL in hypercholesterolemic humans. This cardio-protective effect could be mediated by the increases in populations of bifidobacteria together with increases in PC microbial metabolites with antioxidant activities.

40|$|The hemispheric {{content of}} {{dopamine}} and its metabolites in the frontal cortex, caudatus putamen and nucleus accumbens septi was evaluated {{in relation to}} behavioral lateralization assessed by paw preference. Three groups of C 3 H/He mice were {{selected on the basis}} of their performance in the paw preference test (left-handed, ambidextrous and right-handed) and levels of dopamine and its metabolites were measured in the two hemispheres of each group. Mice showed significant differences in hemispheric content of dopamine and 3 - 4 <b>dihydroxyphenylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> in the nucleus accumbens septi depending on the behavioral lateralization as expressed by paw preference. The hemispheric dominance (right hemisphere/right hemisphere + left hemisphere content of dopamine and metabolites x 100) was also calculated for each mouse. Significant differences in hemispheric dominance for dopamine, 3 - 4 <b>dihydroxyphenylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and 3 -methoxytyramine in the nucleus accumbens were found between right-handed and left-handed mice. This dominance was ipsilateral to the preferred paw: % right hemisphere/total content of dopamine and its metabolites were lowest in left-handed, highest in right-handed and intermediate in ambidextrous mice. Finally, individual % right hemisphere/total content for dopamine, 3 - 4 <b>dihydroxyphenylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and 3 -methoxytyramine in the nucleus accumbens positively correlated with individual paw preference scores.

Cardiac output was rneasured using a thermodilution technique and regional blood ftows using directional pulsed Doppler velocimetry. Dermorphin, at doses of 0. 1 - 100 nmol/kg, increased {{blood pressure and}} hindquarter blood flow, renal and mesenteric resistance, and core temperature. Higher doses (1 - 5 μmol/kg) caused respiratory depression, acidosis, and shock despite profaund sympatho-adrenomedullary stimulation.

Male CD- 1 mice were continuously exposed to 0, 4. 7, 19. 5, and 95. 2 mg phenol/l {{in drinking water}} for 4 weeks. Various immune functions were evaluated and levels of selected neurotransmitters and metabolites measured in discrete brain regions. The doses of phenol did not produce any overt clinical signs of toxicity; peripheral red blood cell counts and hematocrits decreased. A dose of 95. 2 mg/l suppressed the stimulation of cultured splenic lymphocytes by lipopolysaccharide, pokeweed mitogen, and phytohemagglutinin and the response in mixed lymphocyte cultures. The two high doses suppressed antibody production response to the T cell-dependent antigen (sheep erythrocytes), as determined by plaque-forming cells, and serum antibody levels. Mice treated with phenol had lower levels of neurotransmitters in several brain regions. In the hypothalamus, a major norepinephrine-containing compartment, the concentrations of norepinephrine significantly decreased by 29 and 40 % in groups dosed with 19. 5 and 95. 2 mg/l, while dopamine concentrations decreased in the corpus striatum by 21, 26, and 35 % at 4. 7, 19. 5 and 95. 2 mg/l, respectively.

By 7 days postinjection, the protein-bound cysteinyl catechols were still detectable, although reduced in concentration, whereas the free forms {{could no longer be}} measured. Histological examination of striatum at 7 days revealed a central core of nonspecific damage including neuronal loss and gliosis. This core was surrounded by a region containing a marked reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity but no apparent loss of serotonin or synaptophysin immunoreactivity. When dopamine was injected with an equimolar concentration of either ascorbic acid or glutathione, the formation of protein-bound cysteinyl catechols was greatly reduced. Moreover, the specific loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity associated with dopamine injections was no longer detectable, although the nonspecific changes in cytoarchitecture were still apparent. Thus, following its oxidation, dopamine in high concentrations binds to protein in the striatum, an event that is correlated with the specific loss of dopaminergic terminals. We suggest that the selective degeneration of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease may be caused by an imbalance between the oxidation of dopamine and the availability of antioxidant defenses...|$|E

Low doses of ethanol (0. 25 - 0. 5 g/kg i. p.) stimulated DA release specifically in the n. accumbens and elicited pure behavioral stimulation. Higher doses of ethanol (1. 0 - 2. 5 g/kg) elicited sedation and hypnosis and stimulated further DA release and <b>dihydroxyphenylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and homovanillic acid output in the accumbens and, although less, also in the caudate. High doses of ethanol (5 g/kg i. p.) elicited long-lasting hypnosis and sedation and induced a depression followed by stimulation of DA release in the accumbens. DA release in the caudate was stimulated further. Low doses of apomorphine (0. 05 mg/kg s. c.) reversed completely the stimulant effect of 0. 5 g/kg of ethanol on behavior and on DA release in the accumbens. Moreover, the stimulation of behavior and of DA release in the accumbens elicited by 0. 5 g/kg of ethanol were abolished completely by pretreatment with 700 mg/kg of gamma-butyrolactone, an agent which blocks DA firing and DA release.

Furthermore, methamphetamine-pretreated rats were able to increase their concentration of extracellular DA to the same extent as controls in response to a (+) -amphetamine challenge. It is suggested that this adaptive response is probably responsible, at least in part, for the absence of obvious behavioral deficits in animals exposed to neurotoxic doses of methamphetamine...|$|E
40|$|Levels of uric acid, xanthine, hypoxanthine, {{ascorbic acid}} (AA), dehydroascorbic acid, {{glutathione}} (GSH), noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), <b>dihydroxyphenylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA) and and 3 -methoxytyramine were determined in the striatum and/or in the brainstem of 3 -month-old male Wistar rats given manganese (MnCl 2, 200 mg/kg/day for 7 days by gavage) alone or associated with allopurinol. Allopurinol alone (300 mg/kg/day for 4 days by gavage) decreased uric acid and increased xanthine levels {{both in the}} striatum and in the brainstem; moreover, allopurinol decreased the striatal DOPAC + HVA/DA ratio. Allopurinol antagonised the Mn-induced: (a) increase in the DOPAC + HVA/DA ratio; (b) increase in uric acid levels and AA oxidation; and (c) decrease in GSH and NA levels. We conclude that allopurinol may protect against Mn-induced oxidative stress by inhibiting both DA oxidative metabolism and xanthine oxidase-mediated formation of reactive oxygen species...|$|E
40|$|The tremorgenic {{mycotoxin}} verruculogen administered intraperitoneally to Wistar {{rats and}} C 57 BL/ 6 N mice produced a tremorgenic syndrome which lasted about 4 h and, although more severe in mice, was similar in both species. Striatal samples collected from animals sacrificed at 1, 4, 24 h and 7 days after treatment {{showed a significant}} (P < 0. 05 at 1 and 4 h) reduction of the dopamine metabolite 3 ‐methoxytyramine (3 ‐MT), while dopamine (DA) and other metabolites such as <b>dihydroxyphenylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were found not to be significantly modified. The onset and {{the time course of}} the behavioural impairment observed are compatible with the duration of the biochemical changes measured in the striatum. A reduction in DA release rather than an effect on intraneuronal DA metabolism might account, at least in part, for the tremorgenic activity of verruculogen...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the cholinomimetic {{properties}} of the drug L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine (alpha-GPC) at CNS level. Experiments using tritium labelled alpha-GPC indicate that the drug reaches the brain after i. p. and per os administration. In order to study the cholinomimetic properties of this drug an indirect functional index of cholinergic activation was used. In fact cholinergic agonists induce an activation of striatal dopaminergic output. alpha-GPC both i. p. and per os administered increased striatal <b>dihydroxyphenylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DOPAC) content. In addition, the in vitro K+ stimulated dopamine release was increased in rats treated in vivo with alpha-GPC. Since alpha-GPC has a weak displacing activity in QNB binding, the in vivo cholinergic activity {{might be due to}} the fact that this drug may increase the availability of choline for acetylcholine synthesis leading to increased acetylcholine production. This activity may be useful in those situations such as aging in which cholinergic activity is deficient...|$|E
40|$|Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the {{substantia nigra}} pars compacta and the {{resulting}} decrease in striatal dopamine levels are the hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease. Tgfβ and Gdnf {{have been identified as}} neurotrophic factors for dopaminergic midbrain neurons in vivo and in vitro. Haploinsufficiency for either Tgfβ or Gdnf led to dopaminergic deficits. In this study we therefore analyzed the nigrostriatal system of aged Tgfβ 2 +/−/Gdnf+/− double-heterozygous mice. Unexpectedly, we found no morphological changes in the nigrostriatal system as compared with age-matched wild-type mice. There {{were no significant differences in}} the number of TH-positive midbrain neurons and no changes in the optical density of TH immunoreactivity in striata of Tgfβ 2 +/−/Gdnf+/− double-heterozygous mice. Moreover, we found no significant differences in the striatal levels of dopamine and its metabolites <b>dihydroxyphenylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and homovanillic acid. Our results indicate that a combined haploinsufficiency for Tgfβ 2 and Gdnf has no impact on the function and the survival of midbrain DA neurons under normal aging conditions...|$|E
40|$|Rats treated {{continually}} and chronically with trifluoperazine (ca 3 mg/kg/day) for {{six months}} initially developed mild catalepsy and an inhibition of spontaneous locomotor activity; both effects disappeared by three months. An initial increase in dopamine turnover (as measured by levels of homovanillic acid and <b>dihydroxyphenylacetic</b> <b>acid)</b> also disappeared by three months. Apomorphine-induced stereotypy was completely inhibited in drug-treated animals at two weeks, but progressively returned to normal {{after three months of}} drug intake. An exaggerated response to apomorphine developed in animals after six months of drug administration. Inhibition of striatal dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase found during the first month of drug intake was reversed at three months, a trend exaggerated after continuous drug administration {{for six months}}. Specific striatal 3 H-spiperone binding affinity decreased acutely, but was increased after six months drug intake; no change in number of receptor sites occurred. These changes suggest that at least striatal dopamine receptors may become “supersensitive” during chronic neuroleptic treatment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of Parmigiano Reggiano (P. R.) cheese on copulatory behavior was studied in male rats. Sexually naїve, sluggish and potent rats were chronically fed with {{a diet of}} P. R. cheese for 10 d. Mount, intromission, ejaculation latencies {{and the percentage of}} mounting and ejaculating animals were recorded during the mating test. Microdialysis technique was used to detect the extracellular levels of dopamine (DA) and its metabolite <b>dihydroxyphenylacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (DOPAC) in rat brain following the P. R. diet. The P. R. diet was able to improve sexual behavior in naїve rats increasing the percentage of mounting and ejaculating animals. Moreover it was able to reduce latencies of mounts, intromissions and ejaculations and to increase the percentage of mounting and ejaculating animals in sluggish rats. Finally, in the microdialysis study an increase in DA and its metabolite DOPAC was found in P. R. fed naїve rats in comparison with control group...|$|E
