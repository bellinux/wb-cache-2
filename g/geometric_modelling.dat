40|$|<b>Geometric</b> <b>model</b> fitting is a {{fundamental}} task in computer graphics and computer vision. However, most <b>geometric</b> <b>model</b> fitting methods are unable to fit an arbitrary <b>geometric</b> <b>model</b> (e. g. a surface with holes) to incomplete data, due to that the similarity metrics used in these methods are unable to measure the rigid partial similarity between arbitrary models. This paper hence proposes a novel rigid geometric similarity metric, which is able to measure both the full similarity and the partial similarity between arbitrary <b>geometric</b> <b>models.</b> The proposed metric enables us to perform partial procedural <b>geometric</b> <b>model</b> fitting (PPGMF). The task of PPGMF is to search a procedural <b>geometric</b> <b>model</b> space for the model rigidly similar to a query of non-complete point set. Models in the procedural model space are generated according {{to a set of}} parametric modeling rules. A typical query is a point cloud. PPGMF is very useful as {{it can be used to}} fit arbitrary <b>geometric</b> <b>models</b> to non-complete (incomplete, over-complete or hybrid-complete) point cloud data. For example, most laser scanning data is non-complete due to occlusion. Our PPGMF method uses Markov chain Monte Carlo technique to optimize the proposed similarity metric over the model space. To accelerate the optimization process, the method also employs a novel coarse-to-fine model dividing strategy to reject dissimilar models in advance. Our method has been demonstrated on a variety of <b>geometric</b> <b>models</b> and non-complete data. Experimental results show that the PPGMF method based on the proposed metric is able to fit non-complete data, while the method based on other metrics is unable. It is also shown that our method can be accelerated by several times via early rejection...|$|R

50|$|Wireframing {{is one of}} {{the methods}} used in <b>geometric</b> <b>modelling</b> systems. A {{wireframe}} model represents the shape of a solid object with its characteristic lines and points. There are two types of wireframe modelling: Pro's and Con's. In Pro's user gives a simple input to create a shape. It is useful in developing systems. While in Con's wireframe model, it does not include information about inside and outside boundary surfaces. Today, wireframe models are used to define complex solid objects. The designer makes a wireframe model of a solid object, and then the CAD operator reconstructs the object, including detailed analysis. This technique has some advantages: generally the 3-dimensional solid objects are complex, but wireframe models can be viewed in 1 dimension, improving comprehensibility; the solid object can be modified further; the designer can ignore the geometry inside a surface while in solid modelling the designer has to give consistent geometry for all details; wireframe models require less memory space and CPU capacity.|$|E
