Significant variations of the capacity factor are observed along the column. The effect of the density gradient along the column on local diffusivity and dispersion is studied. The column efficiency in systems with significant pressure drops is affected by changes in: the linear velocity of the mobile phase; the diffusion coefficients; and the capacity factors of the solutes along the column.

40|$|Chromatography is, in principle, a {{dilution}} process. In HPLC analysis, on dis-solving the substances to {{be analyzed}} in an eluent and then injecting 20 μl, the peak volume exiting the column is greater than 20 μl. This {{is a consequence of}} the chromatographic conditions. Depending on the column dimensions, there is a critical injection volume, which, if exceeded, leads to additional peak broad-ening. If one dissolves the substances {{to be analyzed}} in a weaker eluent, as is generally done when the gradient elution technique is used, then the injection volume that can be tolerated is increased significantly. The efficiency (Fig. 1. 1) of the column is defined by the plate number N and the selectivity of the separation of two components is given by the separation factor α. The time taken for an eluent or carrier gas molecule to run through the column without retention is the mobile phase <b>hold-up</b> <b>time</b> tM. This often corresponds approximately to the time of the appearance of the first peak in the chromato-gram. If one uses too strong an eluent, all components to be separated are eluted at the <b>hold-up</b> <b>time</b> because they are not held back on the column.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the {{proposed}} converter {{is predicated on}} a moiety-bridge LLC resonant converter structure and a single auxiliary switch is integrated at the primary side. The converter has two different operational characteristics. It shows the same operational characteristic with the conventional LLC resonant converters during nominal state. However, when ac line lost and the converter enters into the <b>hold-up</b> <b>time</b> state, which requires wide voltage gain changes,the control method of {{the proposed}} converter is transmuted to the PWM method utilizing the auxiliary switch. Since the proposed converter compensates wide voltage gain variation with PWM method of the auxiliary switch, the frequency variation range for the LLC resonant converter is highly reduced in the proposed converter. Therefore the transformer in the proposed converter can be designed at the optimal operating point and it results in decremented conduction loss of the magnetizing inductor current. Furthermore, the maximum voltage gain of the proposed converter is facilely incremented by elongating the obligation ratio of the auxiliary switch. It avails to decrement the link capacitance. To verify {{the efficacy of the}} proposed circuit, operational principle will be expounded and experimental results will be presented with following designation. 100 kHz of switching frequency, 250 – 400 V of input voltage range, 250 V of output voltage, and 75 W output potency.

40|$|The {{effect of}} axial {{temperature}} gradient on the chromatographic efficiency was studied under adiabatic conditions by a modeling approach. The Equilibrium-Dispersive model of chromatography {{was used for}} the calculations. The model was extended by taking into account the axial temperature gradient. The results show that due to the temperature gradient, there are retention and migration velocity gradients in the column. Since the retention factor, k is not constant in the column, k cannot be calculated as the ratio of net retention and <b>hold-up</b> <b>times.</b> As a result of the gradual increase of migration velocity, the retention times of solutes decreases as the slope of temperature gradient increases. In addition, the band in the column have extra broadening due to larger migration velocity of the front of band. The width of bands becomes larger at larger change of temperature. In the same time, however, the release velocity of the compounds from the column is increasing as ΔT increases. Accordingly, an apparent peak compression effect makes the peaks thinner. As a result of the two counteracting effects (peak expansion, apparent peak compression) the column efficiency does not change significantly in case of axial temperature gradient under adiabatic conditions. The resolutions, however, decreases slightly due to the decrease of retention times...|$|R
40|$|Radioisotopes are {{radioactive}} {{versions of}} the natural chemical elements, differing from these only in their nuclear mass and {{in their ability to}} emit radiations. They are produced mainly by neutron bombardment of ordinary materials in a nuclear reactor. The most important radiations are beta particles (fast electrons of nuclear origin) and gamma rays (penetrating electromagnetic radiations). These are detected with ionization chambers, Geiger counters or scintillation counters. In production control, the absorption or scattering of radiations is used as a measure of material thickness, and in some cases, of its atomic number. Radioactive tracers aid in production research in rapid determination of mixing efficiencies and <b>hold-up</b> <b>times.</b> Tracers are also used in the non-destructive testing of materials and components and in more basic research into alloy structure. In this latter research, photographic films are used to produce autoradiographs which show the micro-scopic distribution of radioactively labelled constituents. Radioactivation by neutron irradiation enables certain impurities to be assayed at sub-microgram levels without chemical separation. The wear of engine parts can be measured, in a fraction of the time taken for orthodox methods, by making the parts in question radioactive and measuring the worn radioactive debris in circulating lubricant. Cutting tools can be measured similarly by assaying radio-active debris attached to the swarf. For many purposes gamma radiography supplements X-radiography or replaces it as a cheaper alternative.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Using single {{molecule}} fluorescence microscopy, {{we study}} {{the dynamics of}} an electric-field-driven DNA molecule colliding with a single stationary post. The radius of the obstacle is small compared to the contour length of the molecules. Molecules that achieve hooked configurations which span the obstacle were chosen for study. Four different types of hooked configurations were found: symmetric hairpins with constant extension during unhooking, asymmetric hairpins with constant extension during unhooking, asymmetric hairpins with increasing extension during unhooking, and rare multiply looped entangled configurations. The important physics describing the unhooking dynamics for each classification differ and models are proposed to predict unhooking times. Surprisingly, we find that most collisions do not follow classic rope-on-pulley motion but instead form hairpins with increasing total extension during the unhooking process (called X collisions). Last, we show that unraveling to form a hairpin and center-of-mass motion during unhooking affect the overall center of mass <b>hold-up</b> <b>time</b> during a collision process...|$|E

The renormalization procedure adopted yields the Laplace transform of the Residence Time Distribution and allows one to calculate its time moments. The incidence of the connectivity of the medium on dispersion is discussed. The fractal dimension does not appear explicitly in the dispersion properties of the network. Geometrical dispersion is shown to result from the difference of pathlengths offered to the fluid in the generating pattern of the network. The dispersion front is strongly non-Gaussian and presents several maxima (short circuits) in some extreme cases. An approximate expression for the dispersion front is derived when the distribution of pathlengths in naroow.

Drop size distribution measurements using a FBRM probe for various solvent combinations showed that the Sauter mean drop sizes of the dispersed phase were between 30 and 600 µ. The small drops indicate a very high specific interfacial area in the annular zone of up to 10 times the specific interfacial area in stirred tanks.

40|$|Multiphase {{flows of}} heavy oils and other fluids with high {{apparent}} viscosity {{is a particular}} industrial challenge. Main challenges here is that interfacial waves, atomization at the large scale gas–liquid interface as well as bubble entrainment and separation all are significantly modified by high fluid viscosity. In addition the viscous liquid may behave as laminar while gas and other low viscosity liquids show turbulent behaviour. Accordingly, correct modelling of the turbulence, including correct transitional behaviour between turbulent and laminar flow becomes of great importance. In this paper we have investigated two phase flows of gas at a rather high density and viscous oil. Experiments have been performed at the SINTEF Multiphase Flow Laboratory at Tiller, Trondheim. The experimental section was horizontal, with a pipe inner diameter of 69 mm. Pressure drop - and liquid <b>hold-up</b> <b>time</b> series, as well as video-documentation of the flow, were recorded.

The design of disposable diapers {{has changed over the}} years and today thinner products can be produced partly because of the excellent absorption and retention properties of the petrochemical-based SAP. The possibilities of producing alternative absorbent materials from a renewable resource, kraft pulp, are investigated in this thesis. In this work, a four step process was developed using kraft pulp from either softwood or hardwood as the raw material. In the process, kraft pulp fibers were treated with TEMPO oxidation followed by washing, disintegration of the fibers into microfibrillar cellulose (MFC), and porous absorbent foam was then obtained by freeze drying the MFC. Process conditions were evaluated to optimize the properties of the obtained foams. In an attempt to improve the mechanical stability of the foam, un-modified fibres were added before the drying step, thus forming a cellulosic composite material. Tests of absorption properties showed that the absorbent foams had a more rapid absorption rate, similar absorption capacity and about half the retention capacity as compared to commercial SAP. In the foam, wet integrity was provided by the aldehyde groups introduced by TEMPO oxidation possibly through the formation of hemiacetal bonds. A high dosage of primary oxidant and the use of wood from birch as the raw material were the most favourable for maximizing liquid retention in the foams. An increase in the oxidation temperature from 25 ˚C to 50 ˚C decreased the reaction time, reduced the energy demand to disintegrate the fibers, while the retention capacity remained more or less unchanged. Washing experiments showed that in comparison with washing reference pulp, oxidized pulps had a higher specific filtration resistance and thus a larger filter area or longer <b>hold-up</b> <b>time</b> was needed for oxidized pulps. The addition of CTMP fibres increased the liquid retention capacity of the TEMPO-oxidized MFC. At fibre contents around 85 %, the retention capacities of the TEMPO-oxidized MFC were comparable with the capacity of commercial SAP. The preparation of foam on the kilogram-scale showed that a similar morphology to gram-scale experiments was not achieved and consequently liquid retention was lower for kilogram-scale foams...|$|E

South-bound traffic on the A6 here has to negotiate a roundabout and a set of traffic lights, which has numerous and lengthy <b>hold-ups</b> at peak <b>times.</b> The three-laned A6 overlaps the A50 for a couple of miles, and there is a junction with the B6540 (former A453).

40|$|The Reversed Flow - Gas Chromatography Technique (RF-GC) is a {{modified}} Gas Chromatographic method, in which, abandoning the main {{role of the}} carrier gas and replacing it by gaseous diffusion currents, one can measure simultaneously kinetic physicochemical quantities, adsorption energies and related parameters. This {{can be done in}} a simple way, using suitable non linear mathematical models and the experimental data. The purpose of this dissertation is the mathematical modelling and especially the comparative valuation of the different mathematical models of the RF-GC method applied in the action of air pollutants on solids in the laboratory scale, which are analytically (not numerically) solved for the determination of kinetic physicochemical quantities pertaining to the adsorption/desorption phenomena, adsorption energies, local adsorption isotherms, local monolayer capacities, and probability density functions for the adsorption energies, all belonging to time-resolved Chemistry. The RF-GC method experimentally consists of a commercial gas chromatograph with a suitable detector, slightly modified to include a sampling column of stainless steel chromatographic tube of 4 mm I. D. placed inside the chromatograph oven, a diffusion column either with its wall covered by solid material (denuder coating) or partly filled with solid particles forming a solid bed. It is connected perpedicular to the sampling column, around the middle of the latter. The reversing of the direction of the carrier gas flow occurs only in the sampling column, while in a separation column the carrier gas flows only in one direction (with a volumetric flow-rate of about 30 cm 3 /min). No carrier gas flows through the diffusion column and the solid bed, both of these being filled with a stagnant film of the carrier gas. Through the injector a small amount of the probe gas or vapor A (0. 5 - 1 cm 3 under atmospheric pressure) is introduced and then one makes repeated flow-reversals (every 2 - 4 minutes) of short duration (10 - 30 s) of the carrier gas (air, nitrogen or helium) and finally the flow is restored to it’s original direction. This time of each reversal is shorter than the gas <b>hold-up</b> <b>time</b> in the sampling column sections. The carrier gas takes the vapors of the air pollutants, via a four-port valve, to the detector. Finally, one obtains in the recorder a series of narrow, fairly symmetrical sample peaks of considerable height H above the continuous chromatographic signal, depending on the time t when the flow reversal was made. The height H of each peak is proportional to the concentration in the sampling point of the sampling column. It’s half height width is equal to the duration of the flow reversal. ...|$|E
40|$|A compact {{electron}} {{cyclotron resonance}} ion source for radioactive isotopes (IRIS ECR) has been developed for the {sup 14 }O experiment at the 88 -Inch Cyclotron. The {sup 14 }O experiment is a joint effort between the Nuclear Science Division's Weak Interaction Group and the 88 -Inch Cyclotron ECR ion source group. The initial goal of the experimentalists is to measure {sup 14 }O half-life and {{the shape of the}} beta decay spectrum. The 70 second half-life of {sup 14 }O requires producing the isotope on-line at the 88 -Inch Cyclotron. The {sup 14 }O is generated in the form of {sup 12 }C{sup 14 }O in a high temperature carbon aerogel target using a 20 MeV {sup 3 }He{sup +} beam from the LBNL 88 -Inch Cyclotron via the reaction {sup 12 }C({sup 3 }He,n) {sup 14 }O. The {sup 14 }O atoms are then separated from the other radioactive isotopes produced in the target and then implanted into a thin foil. The implanted target serves to minimize the radiation background and maximize the signal in the beta spectrometer by concentrating the{sup 14 }O into a 5 mm diameter spot. An 8 meter long stainless steel transfer line connects the target chamber to the IRIS ECR through a turbo molecular pump. The gas coming from the turbo pump is fed into the ion source and ionized, extracted at energies of 20 to 30 keV and mass separated by an analyzing magnet. The ion source started operation in spring 1999 and achieved a beam intensity of 3 x 10 {sup 5 } {sup 14 }O{sup +} ions/second. Extensive developments on the production target were made to increase extraction efficiency of the {sup 14 }O. A liquid nitrogen trap was installed between the ECR and the turbo pump to minimize the gas load to the ion source. An improved support gas injection system was installed so that multiple support gases can be introduced. A bias disk is used to stabilize the plasma. A quartz liner in the plasma chamber is used to reduce the <b>hold-up</b> <b>time</b> for oxygen and increase the overall ionization efficiency. The extraction system was also modified to ensure reliable operation at 30 kV. In May 2000 IRIS produced a mass separated beam of {sup 14 }O{sup 1 +} ions at an average intensity of 2 x 10 {sup 7 } {sup 14 }O{sup 1 +} ions per second with a peak intensity of 3 x 10 {sup 7 } {sup 14 }O{sup 1 +} ions per second. This is the highest{sup 14 }O intensity achieved at any radioactive beam facility to date. The physics program has begun with a measurement of the {sup 14 }O lifetime in October 2001 and a test run for the CVC experiment during December 2001...|$|E
40|$|Trabajo presentado a la XV Reunión Científica de la Sociedad Española de Cromatografía y Técnicas Afines (SECyTA) celebrada en Castellón de la Plana del 28 al 30 de octubre de 2015 Optimization of a {{separation}} in comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) requires {{the selection of}} an appropriate set column, and the optimisation of their respective dimensions, temperature programs and flow rates. Until not so long ago, a time consuming trial and error process {{was the only way}} to select the columns and chromatographic conditions for the two GC dimensions. During the last few years, several attempts have been proposed to estimate the chromatographic response in GC×GC [1 - 4]. Although most of these methods are helpful contributions, some of them focussed exclusively on the retention time estimation and do not consider the effect of peak width, also essential for a correct prediction of the chromatographic separation capability. Others are based on theoretical formulas not applicable to the extreme experimental conditions used in GC×GC, or are only valid for specific types of compounds or stationary phases: these models cannot be corrected for different separation problems. In this work, modelization of retention time and peak width has been carried out from experimental 1 D GC data in order to estimate the response in GC×GC separation for different column sets operated under different flows and temperatures. Several theoretical and experimental models are proposed for estimation of 1 D and 2 D retention time and peak width; in experimental models, 1 D GC data are required together with information on column characteristics and operation conditions. Models for <b>hold-up</b> <b>time,</b> retention factor and peak width were first validated in 1 D GC from the fit between experimental and calculated data. Their validation in GC×GC was carried out by using n-alkanes and a mixture of disaccharides as their trimethylsilyl oxime derivatives. Comparison of experimental and estimated data showed good results for retention time in both first and second dimension. Peak widths presented, however, some errors, caused by the no consideration on estimation of the effect of the modulator or the rather unusual chromatographic conditions used. The developed programme is very versatile as it can be used for the calculation of the chromatographic response of compounds with different polarity and volatility, analysed under different pressures and temperature ramps, and with different sets of columns.

40|$|Biological Aerated Filter (BAF) {{represent}} a compact wastewater technology {{aimed at improving}} treatment effectiveness by contemporarily minimizing {{the volume of the}} sludge-to-water contactor. BAFs can be classified as three-phase systems as far as their hydrodynamics is concerned and make use of granulated activated carbon (GAC) as a solid support; the macro-pores of this solid immobilize the growing biomass and assure a high sludge-to wastewater flow rate ratio. Our study stars from the standard design criteria adopted for a batch unit and extends the application of BAFs to continuous systems to attain simpler operations. The new concept unit is implemented with an air-lift regulated GAC recirculation and a section for separating the sludge from GAC. The treated water is segregated from the sludge suspension thanks to a careful regulation of flow rates in the biological reactor, which has some similarities with the so-called "backwash upflow sand filter". The experimental work, ahead of treating wastewater from textile industries, defines all the operating variables suitable to steadily maintain the contact time between the liquid and solid phases, the <b>hold-up</b> and recirculation <b>time</b> of GAC and the flow rate ratio between the cleared stream and purge liquid. The experimentation has brought to define: the geometrical features of the unit, GAC hold-up and recirculation rate, main and air lift flow rates.

40|$|Regarding {{a future}} {{expected}} inspection {{in the whole}} country in a range of about 30, 000 km/a, it is required a suitable strategy which ensures the economic feasibility of such a commitment. Due to this municipality providers should generate solutions, bearing in mind if and under which conditions, single sewers should be investigated through predictive procedures, which nowadays are well-defined with constant fixed intervals. Nevertheless, it’s important as well to take into account a substantial improvement to sanitation needs, concerning a concrete implementation and the assigned boundary conditions from such strategy. This uncertain situation with respect to the implementation and use of different inspection strategies and its associated repercussions are the reason why this should be investigated, by clearing very punctual questions through a deep analysis and evaluation of such different strategies. This work includes an overview to {{the state of the art}} concerning optical sewer inspections. Several technical systems for optical condition gathering were analyzed from the literature regarding benefit-cost relationships. From there it is now possible to establish possible boundary conditions and their best operation scenarios. Together with the choice of suitable technical procedures as regards to inspection strategies, is to be clarified as well, when a sewer should be inspected within its normal life cycle. Such inspections can be developed through fixed intervals by means of conventional area-covering strategies, or by means of forecasting strategies. Last ones stand out, since the inspection of a sewer will depend on expected conditions, which could be estimated with statistical methods. Hereby, a mathematical foundation towards the concrete implementation of such personalized strategies will be attained. Afterwards, an evaluation is to be performed, taking into account the structural conditions from sewers, the associated error by the estimation from such conditions, the <b>hold-up</b> <b>time</b> from single sewers particularly during critical conditions and the yearly-based inspection rate. For this particular purpose a numerical method was developed and applied, which allows to simulate the development of sewer conditions under the influence of inspection strategies very close to reality. Every single strategy will be analyzed separately, in order to be able to judge the effects from several case scenarios and their implementations with respect to success potentials. Furthermore, a comparison of such strategies under the logistic and economical aspects is as well to be considered. Due to the huge observation periods in decades, a calibration between the real model and the applied numerical method is not possible. But from the significant effects of the different strategies concerning the formulated target, and since such a model tends to overvalue the potentials of success within conventional area-covering inspection strategies, it is possible for personalized strategies, to state recommendations regarding reasonable implementations with an adequate accuracy. Recapitulating, it will be proved with this work, that there are efficient alternatives from area-covered or partially first inspected sewers if applicable, as far as the expected reiterative area-covering inspections are based on fixed intervals. With such personalized strategies conditions from sewers can be gathered at an inexpensive and quite accurate way. Moreover, such personalized strategies contribute in a better way to the positive development of sewer conditions than conventional inspection strategies. There are many advantages from such strategies even for small sewage systems in municipalities with 10, 000 up to 20, 000 inhabitants. Such advantages tend to increase with bigger sewages. Additionally, it is also possible based on the conclusions of this paper and under the considerations of local conditions, depending on the committed target, to state recommendations for a particular inspection strategy and to estimate the potential savings compared to the contemplated strategy costs...|$|E
