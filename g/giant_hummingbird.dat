50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>hummingbird</b> (Patagona gigas) is {{the largest}} member of the hummingbird family, {{weighing}} 18 - 24 g with a wingspan measuring approximately 21.5 cm in length, and length of 23 cm. This is approximately the same length as a European starling or a northern cardinal, though the <b>giant</b> <b>hummingbird</b> is considerably lighter due to its more slender build and fairly long bill. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Patagona. This weight is almost twice that of the next heaviest recorded species, and ten times that of the smallest humming bird, the bee hummingbird.|$|E
5000|$|Agastache is a genus of {{aromatic}} flowering herbaceous {{perennial plants}} in the family Lamiaceae. It contains 22 species native to eastern Asia (one species) and North America (the rest).

50|$|Another {{version of}} Monster Island existed in Godzilla: The Series, the {{continuation}} of the 1998 film Godzilla. It is originally called Isla del Diablo (not {{to be confused with the}} real-life Devil's Island) and is given the codename: SITE OMEGA. This island was originally the base of operations for the Tachyon aliens as proposed by Major Hicks. This island eventually became home to Crustaceous Rex, King Cobra, the Giant Bat, Skeetera, the <b>Giant</b> Mutant <b>Hummingbirds,</b> and possibly the Shrewster as well as the combined monster population of the Mutant Colosseum and Mutant Mania Circus. Godzilla also visited the island occasionally. Because he traveled with H.E.A.T., he never became a permanent resident. Large, cage-like apparatuses were installed on the island to keep the creatures isolated from each other and they remain on Monster Island to this day. At one point, the base was infiltrated by an organization of eco-terrorists called S.C.A.L.E. who tried to free the monsters, which only resulted in a large scale battle between the beasts before they were imprisoned once again.|$|R
40|$|Considerations on the migrations of two neotropical <b>hummingbirds.</b> <b>Giant</b> Hurnmingbirds,are {{seasonally}} {{common in}} central Chile and adjacent Argentina where they nest, {{but they are}} not seen there from mid autumn to mid winter, and very few museum specimens from this distinct population are available from areas elsewhere so that only weak inferences can be made about the location of their wintering grounds. Fire Crowns are numerous in central Chile from autumn to winter but there is a marked decline in density from early spring to late summer. The destination of these hummingbirds was unknown for a long time but now it is known that the species moves to the south of Chile and Argentina for breeding. The only other species in the genus, S. fernandensis is divided into two subspecies. This is in sharp contrast with the lack of subspecific differentiation of the Más a Tierra population of S. galeritus, and warrants further investigation...|$|R

50|$|The great sapphirewing (Pterophanes cyanopterus) is {{a species}} of hummingbird in the family Trochilidae.It is found in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.Its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist montane forests. At 15.5-17.5 cm (6-7 in) in length and weighing about 10 grams, {{this is one of}} the largest species of hummingbird, though slightly smaller than the Topaza hummingbirds and the <b>giant</b> <b>hummingbird.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Cajas National Park {{is home to}} a large {{variety of}} animals, some of which are endemic or highly endangered.

The violet-throated metaltail (Metalura gorjivioleta) is endemic to Cajas and surrounding valleys. The avifauna consists of 157 bird species, making birdwatching an alluring activity for visitors.|$|E
50|$|The topazes are {{two species}} of {{hummingbirds}} in the genus Topaza. They are found in humid forests in the Amazon Basin.

Males have a total length of about 22 cm, although this includes their elongated rectrices. They are very colourful, being mainly strongly iridescent golden and crimson with a black hood and a green throat. Females lack the elongated rectrices and have a mainly green plumage.|$|E
50|$|Fauna is {{similarly}} distributed, with distinct altitudinal zonation present. The highest altitudes support the endangered mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), cougar (Puma concolor), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), and Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus).

50|$|Between 325 and 340 {{species of}} {{hummingbirds}} are described, depending on taxonomic viewpoint, {{divided into two}} subfamilies, the hermits (subfamily Phaethornithinae, 34 species in six genera), and the typical hummingbirds (subfamily Trochilinae, all the others). However, recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that this division is slightly inaccurate, {{and that there are}} nine major clades of hummingbirds: the topazes and jacobins, the hermits, the mangoes, the coquettes, the brilliants, the <b>giant</b> <b>hummingbird</b> (Patagona gigas), the mountain-gems, the bees, and the emeralds. The topazes and jacobins combined have the oldest split {{with the rest of the}} hummingbirds. The hummingbird family has the second-greatest number of species of any bird family (after the tyrant flycatchers).|$|E
50|$|In Bolivia, the <b>giant</b> <b>hummingbird</b> {{is known}} in Quechua as burro q'enti. The Spanish word burro refers to its dull, {{relatively}} unattractive plumage compared to other locally occurring hummingbirds (e.g., red-tailed comet). Typically members of P. gigas can be identified using their comparative size and characteristics such {{as the presence of}} an eye-ring, straight bill (longer than the head), dull colouration, very long wings (approaching tail tip when stowed), long and moderately forked tail, feathered tarsi to the toes and comparatively large sturdy feet. There is no difference between the sexes. Juvenile specimens can be determined by observing small corrugations on the lateral areas of the beak culmen.|$|E
5000|$|For a hummingbird P. gigas averages a slow {{hovering}} {{state of}} 15 wing beats per second. Resting heart rate for P. gigas is 300/min and peaks at 1020/min. Energy requirements for hummingbirds {{do not scale}} evenly with size increases, meaning a larger bird such as P. gigas requires comparatively more energy per gram to hover than a smaller bird. [...] This demanding homeostatic state means that consuming a huge 4300 calories/hr is the estimated requirement to sustain this. [...] This along with the oxygen availability/hypobaric limitations for hovering at altitudes that the <b>giant</b> <b>hummingbird</b> lives in appears to suggest that P. gigas {{is likely to be}} very close to the viable maximum size for a hummingbird.|$|E
5000|$|... 45 km {{west from}} Caraz (Ancash - Peru) at 4200m above sea level, at Huashta Cruz, on the Cordillera Negra, {{there is a}} [...] (single-species stand) of puyas, with a 145 km view of the Cordillera Blanca. The hilly area is known as Huinchus, and the <b>giant</b> <b>hummingbird</b> (Patagona gigas) is often spotted here. Perhaps the very largest plants {{are to be found}} near the {{abandoned}} village of Manallasac, Huamanga Province, Peru, where the spike per se can be seen to be twenty feet (6.1 meters) long and 4.5 feet (1.37 meters) wide atop a peduncle of an additional five feet (1.5 meters) long. Elsewhere spikes up to 23 feet (7 meters) long and even 29 feet (9 meters) with a width of five feet (1.5 meters) have been photographed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>hummingbird</b> {{is widely}} {{distributed}} throughout {{the length of the}} Andes on both the east and west sides. P. gigas typically inhabit the higher altitude scrubland and forests that line the slopes of the Andes during the summer and then retreat to similar, lower altitude habitats in winter months. The species persists through a large altitude range also with specimens retrieved from sea level up to 4600m. They have shown to be fairly resilient to urbanisation and agricultural activities, however the removal of vegetation limits their distribution in dense city areas and industrial zones.P. g. peruviana has been found from Equador to the South-Eastern mountains of Peru and P. g. gigas from Northern Bolivia and Chile to Argentina. Contact between subspecies is thought to most likely occur around the eastern slopes of the north Peruvian Andes.|$|E
50|$|More than 1000 {{bird species}} have been {{estimated}} {{to exist in the}} park. Birds reported for the lowland rainforest in the park include: the great tinamou, Spix's guan, the rufescent tiger-heron, the blue-and-yellow macaw, the silvery grebe, the harpy eagle, the blue throated piping-guan, the long-billed starthroat, the snowy egret, the king vulture, the ladder-tailed nightjar, the scarlet macaw, the sapphire-spangled emerald, the roseate spoonbill, the stilt sandpiper, the blue-crowned trogon, the turquoise tanager, the Amazonian pygmy owl, the black-throated mango, the blue-headed parrot, etc. Birds present in the mountain zones in the park include: the Andean tinamou, the great horned owl, the torrent duck, the yellow-billed pintail, the amethyst-throated sunangel, the Andean guan, the puna ibis, the golden-collared tanager, the Andean condor, the collared inca, the solitary eagle, the Andean cock-of-the-rock, the masked flowerpiercer, the mountain caracara, the mitred parakeet, the sapphire-vented puffleg, the <b>giant</b> <b>hummingbird,</b> etc.|$|E
5000|$|P. gigas is obligate nectarvorious and feeds from a {{range of}} flowers. The female <b>giant</b> <b>hummingbird</b> has been {{observed}} ingesting sources of high amounts of calcium (sand, soil, slaked lime and wood ash) post reproductive season to replenish the calcium used in egg production, nectar has a very low calcium content necessitating this. Similarly a nectar based diet is low in proteins and various minerals, this is countered by consuming insects on occasion. [...] Though there is a report of a nesting Broad-tailed hummingbird that sustained itself for several days only upon arthropods, this suggests that insects may have a larger part in hummingbird diet in some instances than previously thought. Supporting this is the fact that hummingbirds have evolved the ability to bend their mandibular bone midway down, manipulate their bottom jaw laterally and snap their jaw shut faster to accommodate better capture of flying insects.|$|E
40|$|Among vertebrates, {{hummingbirds}} (family Trochilidae) {{represent an}} extreme outcome in vertebrate physiological design, and are unique in their capacity for sustained hovering flight. Because hovering flight {{is one of}} the most energetically demanding forms of locomotion requiring high levels of metabolic power input and mechanical power output, hummingbirds offer a useful system to study their energetics and flight mechanics. There are about 330 species of hummingbirds, of which 70 % of the species weigh less than six grams and about 30 % are between six and ten grams. Surprisingly, just one species, Patagona gigas (the <b>Giant</b> <b>Hummingbird),</b> weighs on average 20 g, making it an outlier in the hummingbird body size distribution. 	Because power requirements increase with (body mass) 1. 17, whereas maximum aerobic capacity of volant animals scales negatively with body mass, large body size presents a dual mechanical/metabolic challenge to hovering flight in the <b>Giant</b> <b>Hummingbird.</b> In spite of the challenges of supporting its large body weight, P. gigas inhabits a broad altitudinal range, from sea level to 4500 m. a. s. l. At higher altitudes, where the combination of low air density, low partial pressure of oxygen and low temperatures makes both lift generation and flight energetics especially costly to achieve, P. gigas, on account of its large body size, is likely to face more extreme energetic restrictions. The overarching goal of my research program has been to determine the specific physical and environmental constraints that limit upper body size in hummingbirds, and to elucidate those aspects of the <b>Giant</b> <b>Hummingbird</b> lifestyle, physiology, biochemistry and biomechanics that have liberated it from these constraints. First, through measurements of daily, basal, and hovering rates of oxygen consumption in the <b>Giant</b> <b>Hummingbird,</b> I have shown that this species, although a clear outlier in terms of body size, does not deviate significantly from metabolic relationships derived from smaller hummingbirds. During this research I also measured enzyme flux capacities (V max values) of key enzymes in pathways of glucose and fatty acid oxidation in the flight muscles of the <b>Giant</b> <b>Hummingbird</b> as well as smaller species. Because flight muscles account for most of the VO 2 during hovering flight, I was able to accurately estimate metabolic flux rates from respirometric data obtained during hovering flight. My results reveal that hummingbirds share a highly conserved set of pathways for glucose and fatty acid oxidation. In addition, there was a lack of quantitative, mass-dependent interspecific variation in V max values for most of the enzymes involved in glucose and fat oxidation, in spite of the mass-dependent interspecific variation in hovering metabolic rate found in my first study. These results suggest a "one size fits all" hypothesis, i. e., qualitative as well as quantitative evolutionary conservation of pathways of energy metabolism. The lack of correlation between V max values and flux rates at most steps in energy metabolism, suggests that the interspecific variation in flux through pathways of glucose and fatty acid oxidation during hovering is achieved through modulation of enzyme activities, rather than adjustments in enzyme concentration. Overall, the allometric analyses and the enzyme flux capacities indicate that the <b>Giant</b> <b>Hummingbird</b> is just a "big" hummingbird and not an allometric outlier: estimates of metabolic parameters fall close to the allometric projections from smaller hummingbirds. However, my previous experiments were done at low elevations where the energetic requirements are lower. Consequently, the occurrence of P. gigas at a wide range of altitudes provides an excellent "natural experiment," with which to assess the behavioural, biomechanical and energetic responses of this bird to natural hypobaric variation. Accordingly, I explored the mechanisms used by this species to cope with the enhanced energetic and aerodynamic demands of living at high elevations. I measured flight kinematics (wingbeat frequency and stroke amplitude) and energetics (oxygen consumption) during hovering flight at two elevations spanning a 3700 m elevational gradient along the Andes Mountains of Peru. Contrary to my predictions, the <b>Giant</b> <b>Hummingbird</b> increased wing stroke amplitudes and wingbeat frequencies equally, and thus increased mechanical power output at high elevations relative to sea level. Moreover, oxygen consumption during hovering increased significantly (~ 33 %) at the high elevation site. However, based on the observed increase in mechanical power, the 33 % increase in metabolic power was larger than expected. It is unclear why metabolic costs would increase at a substantially greater rate than mechanical power output. Perhaps, exploring how the <b>Giant</b> <b>Hummingbird</b> modulates detailed wingbeat kinematics (e. g. wing rotation, angle of attack, torsion along the wing) might help to explain the unexpected lack of correlation between mechanical and metabolic power. Also, Patagona gigas gigas is a subspecies that inhabits mainly low elevations up to 2500 m. Studying this group in comparison to P. gigas peruviana (high elevation subspecies) could elucidate the mechanical and physiological mechanisms that have enabled the <b>Giant</b> <b>Hummingbird</b> to adapt to extremely different environmental conditions in spite of the high cost. Moreover, these comparisons may shed some light on the evolutionary trade-offs and constraints that have shaped the history and the evolutionary potential of hummingbird species. In summary, my dissertation shows that in spite of the large size of the <b>Giant</b> <b>Hummingbird,</b> it is not an outlier in terms of energetics or flight performance when compared to smaller hummingbirds. These findings may suggest that hummingbirds body size distribution and upper body size limit might have an ecological explanation rather than a physiological, biochemical or biomechanical constraint...|$|E
