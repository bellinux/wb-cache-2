25|$|Maas {{picked the}} league apart {{in his first}} year as a starter, and despite his late start was a West Division All-Star and the Edmonton nominee for CFL Outstanding Player. He threw 231 {{complete}} of 391 attempts for 3,646 yards, recording 21 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. His performance in the 2001 Labour Day Classic, when Maas was the offensive star and recorded a late 23-yard run to set up the winning field goal as time expired, made him an instant fan favourite. Maas led the Eskimos to first place in one of the weakest Western Divisions of all time, as the Esks won the division by winning only as many as they lost. The end of the year was sour as the Eskimos were blown out by the rival Calgary Stampeders in the Western Finals, 34–18. Maas emerged with little credit in the defeat, and after two straight years of disappointment, the local media were beginning to speculate whether the Eskimos were <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> past the Western Final.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Inskeep of Stylus {{magazine}} noted, [...] "...nearly {{the whole}} of 'Jump' sounds to these ears like a Pet Shop Boys homage." [...] Matt Zakosek of The Chicago Maroon wrote: [...] "The stand-out tracks here are 'Jump' and 'Push', which sound {{as close to the}} 80s Madonna as we're probably <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> again. The lyrics of Jump' are joyous, recalling the fun, community-minded Madonna of True Blue and Like a Prayer." [...] Diego Costa of UWM Post wrote that [...] "Jump" [...] is a [...] "bossy, slightly sadistic spoken intro by Madonna, just like in 'Erotica', so who can resist? A knock-yourself-out, club-tailored take on the wasteful nature of inertia." [...] Margaret Moser of The Austin Chronicle called the song [...] "slinky and sexy".|$|E
500|$|The {{theme song}} was {{composed}} by Mark Harrison and Blaise Smith, while {{the lyrics to}} the song were written by series creator Stephen Hillenburg and the series' original creative director Derek Drymon.

It has been dubbed [...] "Painty the Pirate", and according to Tom Kenny, Hillenburg found it in a thrift shop [...] "years ago". Patrick Pinney gives voice to Painty the Pirate, singing the theme song as the character. Hillenburg's lips were imposed onto the painting and move along with the lyrics. Kenny joked that this is [...] "about as close of a glimpse as most SpongeBob fans are <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> of Steve Hillenburg", because of Hillenburg's private nature.|$|E

[...] On the first three releases, Miller shared co-writing credits on [...] "The Young Drug" [...] with Alternate Learning's Carolyn O'Rourke, and on [...] "Life in July" [...] with Nancy Becker. Miller also included three songs that were written by Fred Juhos, and later defended the decision to record Juhos's songs as a Beatles-like [...] "relief from seriousness," [...] though only one was included in the Distortion of Glory compilation. Juhos's contributions were criticized as failing to mesh with Miller's, and Miller later mused, [...] "It's funny that his stuff wasn't popular.

Max Illidge stated in 2002 [...] "We could have made a video for it and maybe if the video was shocking enough it would have given us a bigger push, but London-Sire just decided to scrap [...] "Falling Down" [...] and go with [...] "Wither Away" [...] for the video. I mean we were literally going to leave in like a few days to shoot the video for ‘Wither Away" [...] — en route to LA — we had the plane tickets and the actresses schedules and just all that, and we were about three days away from the day of shooting and we got the phone call that we weren’t doing it {{and they were going to}} wait until early next year, but we knew that they were folding.

5000|$|Leven {{wrote about}} the [...] "Sir Vincent" [...] pseudonym:Some years ago I noticed that I was writing a lot more songs than I was <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> record and <b>get</b> released, {{especially}} in these times where you can only release one studio album every eighteen months. As I am a writer of genius, this began to worry me more and more. So I went to see my Cooking Vinyl boss, Martin Goldschmidt, to ask him if I could make more records. He said no. I said to him 'look, The Beatles once released four albums in one year, and nobody said to them, hey that's too many records in one year'. Martin said 'Jackie, this is not 1967 {{and you are not}} The Beatles'. We talked some more and we agreed that I could make records under a different name - that name is Sir Vincent Lone.|$|R
2500|$|Butler and {{his musical}} partner David McAlmont, {{and a number}} of other musicians formed the {{backbone}} of Duffy's band for her debut album, Rockferry, which was released on A Records on 3 March 2008. The black and white album art and video for the title track were shot by directors Luke Seomore and Joseph Bull, on and around the Ffestiniog Railway in Porthmadog, which was renamed 'Rockferry' for the occasion. According to Duffy, [...] "The album took nearly four years to make. We had to hire cheap, tiny studios and sometimes there would be three-week periods between writing and recording." [...] Bernard Butler, who was not initially paid, produced four songs for the album, including the single, [...] "Rockferry". The singles [...] "Mercy" [...] and [...] "Stepping Stone", were co-written and produced by Steve Booker, and the second single [...] "Warwick Avenue", by Jimmy Hogarth and Eg White. Duffy released the debut limited edition single [...] "Rockferry" [...] in November 2007 followed by the Steve Booker co-written and produced single, [...] "Mercy", which went straight to number one. [...] "Mercy" [...] was the last song written for the album. The single was physically released on 25 February 2008. She revealed that both [...] "Mercy" [...] and [...] "Stepping Stone" [...] are autobiographical; [...] "Mercy" [...] is about [...] "sexual liberty" [...] and [...] "not doing something somebody else wants you to do", and [...] "Stepping Stone" [...] is about not expressing her feelings to a person she fell in love with. [...] "Warwick Avenue" [...] was the second single released from the album. The song occurred when Duffy, then 19 years old, was familiarising herself with the London Underground and accidentally found herself at the Warwick Avenue station. The following day the song [...] "just sort of came out". At first the video for the song was meant to be an elaborate production but ended up a tearful head shot in a taxi cab with Duffy's mascara smudging. Duffy has said [...] "That's as close as I'm <b>ever</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to doing a performance that's real in a video." ...|$|E

[...] — Trevor Horn, on the inspiration of The Age of Plastic production sound The Age of Plastic lasts for a total length of 36 minutes and 24 seconds. Unable to make the album sound like what was typical of other records released in the late 1970s, as well as finding it boring, Horn [...] "figured that if I couldn't <b>get</b> records <b>to</b> sound like Elton John, which I couldn't because I couldn't {{figure out how they}} did it, then whatever I could do, I'd better exaggerate it." [...] He had also wanted to [...] "perverse things with sound, except that in 1978 and 1979, none of the equipment which would later allow me to do that was available. So I had to pre-date that technology by finding my own ways of achieving certain sounds." [...] Audio noted the album's sound to be reminiscent of duo Godley & Creme's debut album Consequences.|$|R
