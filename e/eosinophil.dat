5|$|Unlike its {{neighbours}} in the halogen column (chlorine and iodine), bromine is {{not known}} to have a confirmed biological role in humans. A single 2014 study suggests {{that it may be}} a necessary catalyst to make collagen IV, making it essential to basement membrane architecture and tissue development, but these findings have not been confirmed and the precise role posited for bromine is not certain. Aside from this, only circumstantial evidence in the form of hypothesised deprivation symptoms exists for a trace role for bromine. Nevertheless, even if bromine is not an essential element, it can be pharmacologically beneficial. For example, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, formed by the <b>eosinophil,</b> and either chloride or bromide ions, <b>eosinophil</b> peroxidase provides a potent mechanism by which eosinophils kill multicellular parasites (such as, for example, the nematode worms involved in filariasis) and some bacteria (such as tuberculosis bacteria). <b>Eosinophil</b> peroxidase is a haloperoxidase that preferentially uses bromide over chloride for this purpose, generating hypobromite (hypobromous acid), although the use of chloride is possible.|$|E
5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have <b>eosinophil</b> involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E
40|$|Human <b>eosinophils</b> {{are known}} to lose Ia antigen {{expression}} as they mature, and, accordingly, <b>eosinophils</b> obtained from the blood of five eosinophilic donors and three of four normal donors failed to display the major histocompatibility complex class II antigen HLA-DR, as determined by flow cytometry. However, when <b>eosinophils</b> from these nine donors were maintained in culture with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and murine 3 T 3 fibroblasts, HLA-DR consistently developed on the <b>eosinophils.</b> By days 4 - 6 of culture, 24 - 97 % of <b>eosinophils</b> were HLA-DR+, and the <b>eosinophils</b> remained morphologically mature. In contrast, another class II antigen, HLA-DQ, was not detectable by flow cytometry on <b>eosinophils</b> from eight of nine donors. Cultured <b>eosinophils</b> were able to synthesize HLA-DR, as documented by the incorporation of [35 S]methionine into immunoprecipitable HLA-DR heavy and light chains.

40|$|By in situ hybridization, 44 - 100 % of {{the blood}} <b>eosinophils</b> from five {{patients}} with hypereosinophilia and four normal subjects exhibited intense hybridization signals for TNF-alpha mRNA. TNF-alpha protein was detectable by immunohistochemistry in blood <b>eosinophils</b> of hypereosinophilic subjects, and purified blood <b>eosinophils</b> from three atopic donors exhibited cycloheximide-inhibitable spontaneous release of TNF-alpha in vitro. Many blood <b>eosinophils</b> (39 - 91 %) from hypereosinophilic donors exhibited intense labeling for macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 alpha (MIP- 1 alpha) mRNA, whereas <b>eosinophils</b> of normal donors demonstrated only weak or undetectable hybridization signals for MIP- 1 alpha mRNA. Most tissue <b>eosinophils</b> infiltrating nasal polyps were strongly positive for both TNF-alpha and MIP- 1 alpha mRNA. By Northern blot analysis, highly enriched blood <b>eosinophils</b> from a patient with the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome exhibited differential expression of TNF-alpha and MIP- 1 alpha mRNA. These findings indicate that human <b>eosinophils</b> represent a potential source of TNF-alpha and MIP- 1 alpha, that levels of expression of mRNA for both cytokines are high in the blood <b>eosinophils</b> of hypereosinophilic donors and in <b>eosinophils</b> infiltrating nasal polyps, that the <b>eosinophils</b> of normal subjects express higher levels of TNF-alpha than MIP- 1 alpha mRNA, and that <b>eosinophils</b> purified from the blood of atopic donors can release TNF-alpha in vitro...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>eosinophils</b> are {{involved}} in tyrosine nitration. In this study, we evaluated tyrosine nitration by rat <b>eosinophils</b> isolated from peritoneal fl uid and constituent <b>eosinophils</b> in the stomach. Rat peritoneal <b>eosinophils</b> activated with 1 &# 956;M phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and 50 &# 956;M NO 2 &# 65437; showed immunostaining for nitrotyrosine only in smaller cells, despite the fact that <b>eosinophils</b> are capable of producing superoxide (O 2 Â·&# 65437;). Free tyrosine nitrating capacity after incubation with PMA and NO 2 &# 65437; was 4 -fold higher in <b>eosinophils</b> than in neutrophils. Catalase and &# 65400;- and &# 65402; -tocopherol inhibited free tyrosine nitration by reactive nitrogen species from <b>eosinophils</b> but not that by peroxynitrite. Superoxide dismutase augmented free tyrosine nitration by activated <b>eosinophils</b> and peroxynitrite. The concentration of nitric oxide released from <b>eosinophils</b> was relatively low (0. 32 &# 956;M/ 106 cells/h) and did not contribute to the formation of nitrotyrosine. On the other hand, most constituent <b>eosinophils</b> constituent in the rat stomach stimulated by PMA and NO 2 &# 65437; showed tyrosine nitration capacity. These results suggest that intact cells other than apoptotic-like <b>eosinophils</b> eluted in the intraperitoneal cavity could not generate reactive species responsible for nitration by a peroxidase-dependent mechanism. In contrast, normal <b>eosinophils</b> in the stomach were capable of nitration, suggesting that the characteristics of <b>eosinophils</b> in gastric mucosa are diff erent from those eluted in the peritoneal cavity. </p...|$|R
25|$|Until recently, {{peripheral}} eosinophilia (high <b>eosinophil</b> counts) {{was considered}} partly indicative of ABPA.

25|$|A normal <b>eosinophil</b> {{count is}} {{considered}} to be less than 0.65/L. <b>Eosinophil</b> counts are higher in newborns and vary with age, time (lower in the morning and higher at night), exercise, environment, and exposure to allergens.

25|$|Eosinophilia {{is not a}} {{reliable}} measure of extent of infection because it varies from individual to individual. Some cases with multiple pairs of worms have reported low <b>eosinophil</b> levels, while other cases with a single pair had very high <b>eosinophil</b> counts. Such variation {{may be due to}} the lack of host tissue invasion by the parasite, since M. laryngeus attaches to the mucosal epithelium in the tracheolaryngeal region.

40|$|Bronchial asthma (BA) is {{characterized}} by infiltration of the respiratory tracts by <b>eosinophils.</b> A wide variety of adhesion molecules {{is involved in the}} binding of <b>eosinophils</b> to the vascular endothelium and their subsequent transmigration from the circulation to the airways, while little is known about CD 44 expression on <b>eosinophils.</b> In the present study we introduce a novel staining combination with which surface markers on <b>eosinophils</b> can be analyzed without purification prior to staining and examined whether the expression of CD 44 on peripheral blood <b>eosinophils</b> could be monitored as a marker of the control of BA. Staining of <b>eosinophils</b> with anti-CD 16 and anti-VLA- 4 monoclonal antibodies enabled us to delineate <b>eosinophils</b> as VLA- 4 highCDl 6 - cells from other leukocyte populations in the whole blood. CD 44 was constitutively expressed on resting <b>eosinophils</b> and expression increased following cytokine-mediated activation. In all BA patients examined, CD 44 high <b>eosinophils</b> were enriched in sputum relative to peripheral blood, indicating that <b>eosinophils</b> in sputum were more activated than those in the blood. By comparing the extent of CD 44 expression on blood <b>eosinophils</b> from poorly controlled and well-controlled asthma patients, we unexpectedly found that the density of CD 44 expression is lower on blood <b>eosinophils</b> from the poorly controlled group. Thus, the extent of CD 44 expression on blood <b>eosinophils</b> defined as VLA- 4 highCD 16 - cells is a novel marker indicative of the management of BA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} implicating <b>eosinophils</b> in host defence against parasites {{as well as}} allergic disease pathologies. However, a lack of reagents such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for <b>eosinophils</b> has {{made it difficult to}} confirm the functional role of <b>eosinophils</b> in such disease conditions. Using an established mammary model of allergic inflammation in sheep, large numbers of inflammatory cells enriched for <b>eosinophils</b> were collected from parasite-stimulated mammary glands and used for the generation of mAbs against ovine <b>eosinophils.</b> Results A panel of mAbs was raised against ovine <b>eosinophils</b> of which two were shown to be highly specific for <b>eosinophils.</b> The reactivity of mAbs 3. 252 and 1. 2 identified <b>eosinophils</b> from various cell and tissue preparations with no detectable reactivity on cells of myeloid or lymphoid lineage, tissue mast cells, dendritic cells, epithelial cells or other connective tissues. Two other mAbs generated in this study (mAbs 4. 4 and 4. 10) were found to have reactivity for both <b>eosinophils</b> and neutrophils. Conclusion This study describes the production of new reagents to identify <b>eosinophils</b> (as well as granulocytes) in sheep that will be useful in studying the role of <b>eosinophils</b> in disease pathologies in parasite and allergy models. </p...|$|R
40|$|Asthma is {{characterized}} by appearance of <b>eosinophils</b> in the airway. <b>Eosinophils</b> purified from the airway 48 h after segmental antigen challenge are described as exhibiting greater adhesion to albumin-coated surfaces via an unidentified Î² 2 integrin and increased expression of Î±MÎ² 2 (CD 11 b/ 18) compared with purified blood <b>eosinophils.</b> We have investigated the determinants of this hyperadhesive phenotype. Airway <b>eosinophils</b> exhibited increased reactivity with the CBRM 1 / 5 anti-Î±M activation-sensitive antibody as well as enhanced adhesion to VCAM- 1 (CD 106) and diverse ligands, including albumin, ICAM- 1 (CD 54), fibrinogen, and vitronectin. Purified blood <b>eosinophils</b> did not adhere to the latter diverse ligands. Enhanced adhesion of airway <b>eosinophils</b> was blocked by anti-Î±MÎ² 2. Podosomes, structures implicated in cell movement and proteolysis of matrix proteins, were larger and more common on airway <b>eosinophils</b> adherent to VCAM- 1 when compared with blood <b>eosinophils.</b> Incubation of blood <b>eosinophils</b> with IL- 5 replicated the phenotype of airway <b>eosinophils.</b> That is, IL- 5 enhanced recognition of Î±M by CBRM 1 / 5; stimulated Î±MÎ² 2 -mediated adhesion to VCAM- 1, albumin, ICAM- 1, fibrinogen, and vitronectin; and increased podosome formation on VCAM- 1. Thus, the hyperadhesion of airway <b>eosinophils</b> after antigen challenge is mediated by upregulated and activated Î±MÎ² 2...|$|R

25|$|Medications, {{substance}} abuse, {{and environmental}} exposures may all trigger <b>eosinophil</b> dysfunction. Medications such as NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen), nitrofurantoin, phenytoin, L-tryptophan, daptomycin and ampicillin and drugs of abuse such as inhaled heroin and cocaine may trigger an allergic response {{which results in}} EP. Chemicals such as sulfites, aluminum silicate, and cigarette smoke can cause EP when inhaled. A New York City firefighter developed EP after inhalation of dust from the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.|$|E
25|$|Several {{medications}} {{may be used}} {{to block}} the action of allergic mediators, or to prevent activation of cells and degranulation processes. These include antihistamines, glucocorticoids, epinephrine (adrenaline), mast cell stabilizers, and antileukotriene agents are common treatments of allergic diseases. Anti-cholinergics, decongestants, and other compounds thought to impair <b>eosinophil</b> chemotaxis, are also commonly used. Though rare, the severity of anaphylaxis often requires epinephrine injection, and where medical care is unavailable, a device known as an epinephrine autoinjector may be used.|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{surfactant}} protein-D (SP-D) is a multifunctional, {{pattern recognition}} molecule involved in resistance to allergen challenge and pulmonary inflammation. In view of therapeutic effects of exogenous SP-D or recombinant fragment of human surfactant protein-D (rhSP-D) (composed of eight Gly-X-Y collagen repeat sequences, homotrimeric neck and lectin domains) in murine models of lung allergy and hypereosinophilic SP-D gene-deficient mice, we investigated {{the possibility of}} a direct interaction of purified rhSP-D with human <b>eosinophils</b> derived from allergic patients and healthy donors. rhSP-D showed a sugar- and calcium-dependent binding to human <b>eosinophils,</b> suggesting involvement of its carbohydrate recognition domain. While <b>eosinophils</b> from allergic patients showed a significant increase in apoptosis, oxidative burst and CD 69 expression in presence of rhSP-D, <b>eosinophils</b> from healthy donors showed no significant change. However, these <b>eosinophils</b> from healthy donors when primed with IL- 5 exhibited increase in apoptosis on incubation with rhSP-D. Apoptosis mediated by rhSP-D in primed <b>eosinophils</b> was not affected by the antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine. There was a manifold increase in binding of rhSP-D to apoptotic <b>eosinophils</b> than the normal <b>eosinophils</b> and rhSP-D induced a significant increase in uptake of apoptotic <b>eosinophils</b> by J 774 A. 1 macrophage cells. The study suggests that rhSP-D mediated preferential increase of apoptosis of primed <b>eosinophils</b> while not affecting the normal <b>eosinophils</b> and increased phagocytosis of apoptotic <b>eosinophils</b> may be important mechanisms of rhSP-D and plausibly SP-D-mediated resolution of allergic eosinophilic inflammation in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disorder of unknown etiology, {{in which the}} esophagus is infiltrated by <b>eosinophils</b> and T cells. Topical corticosteroids {{are one of the}} treatment options for patients with EoE. The function of <b>eosinophils</b> in EoE is unknown, here we hypothesize that <b>eosinophils</b> serve as immunoregulatory cells. The <b>eosinophils</b> in the blood of untreated adult patients with EoE have a distinct phenotype. The aims of this thesis were to explore whether the eosinophilic phenotype of untreated patients with EoE can be reverted to the healthy phenotype by topical corticosteroid treatment, and to examine whether blood <b>eosinophils</b> from children with EoE have a distinct phenotype, different from that of healthy children. Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that <b>eosinophils,</b> similar to regulatory T cells, can diminish T cell proliferation and express FOXP 3. The role of the eosinophilic protein galectin- 10 in mediating immunosuppression was also investigated. This thesis demonstrates that the EoE phenotype of blood <b>eosinophils</b> is not restored by topical corticosteroid treatment, except with respect to CD 18. We also show that <b>eosinophils</b> from patients with EoE have an immunoregulatory phenotype, i. e., increased levels of FOXP 3 and galectin- 10. Moreover, <b>eosinophils</b> from healthy subjects and patients with EoE are able to suppress T cell proliferation in vitro, in part via galectin- 10. We show that <b>eosinophils</b> exposed to activated T cells release galectin- 10 via DNA nets and appear to transfer this protein to T cells through synapses. Two subsets of <b>eosinophils</b> emerge after co-culturing. Finally, we demonstrate that the blood <b>eosinophils</b> of children with EoE have a distinct phenotype, different from that of healthy children and that of adults with EoE. Importantly, we reveal marked age-related differences regarding the molecular patterns displayed by the blood <b>eosinophils</b> of healthy donors. Our finding that <b>eosinophils</b> from patients with EoE have upregulated immunoregulatory molecules could indicate that the function of <b>eosinophils</b> in EoE is to reduce a T cell-mediated inflammation in the esophagus...|$|R

25|$|Dead-end hosts are {{represented}} by large bovids, suids, llamas, horses and some Old World cervids. Infections in dead-end hosts are characterized by excessive fibrosis, thick-walled encapsulation of flukes within hepatic parenchyma, and black pigmentation of various tissues. Both afferent and efferent bile ducts are totally occluded and are marked by tracts of fibrous tissue. The eggs can not be passed into the bile system, and, therefore, the infection is not patent. In addition, flukes rarely mature in dead-end hosts probably due to strong immune response. Nevertheless, appearance of F. magna eggs in the faeces of a single experimentally infected calf has been documented. Rarely have the pathophysiology or clinical symptoms in dead-end hosts have been studied.

Examination of the urine may show red blood cells (occasionally in casts as seen under the microscope) and increased levels of protein; in a third of the cases with kidney involvement, eosinophils can also be detected in the urine. If vasculitis is suspected, complement levels may be determined as reduced levels are often encountered in vasculitis; complement is a group of proteins that forms part of the innate immune system.

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for separating <b>eosinophils</b> from other types of leucocyte in normal individuals. Erythrocytes are sedimented with dextran, and mononuclear cells are removed on an isotonic density gradient of ficoll and sodium diatrizoate. The <b>eosinophils</b> and neutrophils are then washed and sedimented onto plastic petri dishes coated with human IgG and rabbit anti-human IgG antibody; As neutrophils and monocytes have Fc-binding sites for complexed rabbit IgG they attach to the dishes, and the unabsorbed normal <b>eosinophils</b> which lack this binding site are eluted in a purified suspension. The mean purity of the <b>eosinophils</b> obtained in this way was 70 %, range 50 - 90 %, and the mean yield was 49 %, range 21 - 81 %. This method provides purified <b>eosinophils</b> from normal people without subjecting them to osmotic or plasma membrane stimulation. Normal <b>eosinophils</b> which are prepared in this way are particularly suitable for studying {{the ways in which}} <b>eosinophils</b> became altered in disease states...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Studies with {{isolated}} {{cells are}} important to the understanding of mechanisms by which <b>eosinophils</b> participate in allergic inflammation. Due to species variability, isolation techniques and cell biology need to be defined for each source. We developed methods to obtain rat <b>eosinophils</b> with purity and viability exceeding 90 %, characterized the superoxide anion production of these cells in response to standard activators, and compared these results with those previously obtained in our laboratories with the use of human eosmophils. Rat <b>eosinophils</b> responded vigorously to phorbol myristate acetate and poorly to platelet-activating factor and to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, parallel to the responses of human <b>eosinophils.</b> In contrast, rat <b>eosinophils</b> responded unlike human <b>eosinophils</b> to other activators, having a larger response to calcium ionophore A 23187, a smaller response to serumtreated or serum-opsomzed zymosan, and a negative rather than positive modulatory effect of cytochalasm B. We conclude that rat <b>eosinophils</b> can be obtained in high purity and with intact responsiveness to a number of different activators. J. Leukoc. Biol...|$|R
