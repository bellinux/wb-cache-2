5|$|Sham, {{who had won}} the Santa Anita Derby, {{was seen}} as the most {{formidable}} challenger to Secretariat in the Derby because of his finish ahead of Secretariat in the Wood and his Santa Anita victory. Coming off the heels of the his victory at the Wood, Angle Light was seen as a threat to win. Angle Light was also trained by Lucien Laurin, along with as Secretariat, and thus Secretariat and Angle Light were coupled for betting purposes. Flamingo Stakes winner Our Native finished first or second in seven of his nine starts during the 1973 season, causing him to be named as a contender. Blue Grass Stakes winner My Gallant and Shecky Greene, who won the Fountain of Youth Stakes, were both trained in Chicago by Lou <b>Goldline,</b> which also resulted in their odds being coupled. <b>Goldline</b> said the two horses were similar and would do well at Churchill Downs because they both liked fast tracks. Impecunious, who was victorious in the Arkansas Derby, was initially entered in the race, but withdrew two days before because of a bruised heel.

40|$|Lunar cycle-associated {{physiology}} {{has been}} found {{in a wide variety of}} organisms. Recent study has revealed that mRNA levels of Cryptochrome (Cry), one of the circadian clock genes, were significantly higher on a full moon night than on a new moon night in coral, implying the involvement of a photoreception system in the lunar-synchronized spawning. To better establish the generalities surrounding such a mechanism and explore the underlying molecular mechanism, we focused on the relationship between lunar phase, Cry gene expression, and the spawning behavior in a lunar-synchronized spawner, the <b>goldlined</b> spinefoot (Siganus guttatus), and we identified two kinds of Cry genes in this animal. Their mRNA levels showed lunar cycle-dependent expression in the medial part of the brain (mesencephalon and diencephalon) peaking at the first quarter moon. Since this lunar phase coincided with the reproductive phase of the <b>goldlined</b> spinefoot, Cry gene expression was considered a state variable in the lunar phase recognition system. Based on the expression profiles of SgCrys together with the moonlight’s pattern of timing and duration during its nightly lunar cycle, we have further speculated on a model of lunar phase recognition for reproductive control in the <b>goldlined</b> spinefoot, which integrates both moonlight an...|$|R

40|$|Many teleost fishes inhabiting shallow {{tropical}} waters exhibit synchronous spawning around species-selective lunar phases {{during their}} spawning season. For example, ovaries of the <b>goldlined</b> spinefoot (Siganus guttatus) develop during a single period {{each year from}} June to July in the Ryukyu Islands, Japan, while those of the <b>goldlined</b> spinefoot in the Karimunjawa Archipelago, Indonesia, develop twice a year from March to May, and then again from September to November. Increases in photoperiod and water temperature are possible cues for the initiation of reproductive activity in the populations around the Ryukyu Islands, while the transition between the rainy and dry season may trigger the initiation of reproductive activity in the Karimunjawa Archipelago populations. Moreover, the <b>goldlined</b> spinefoot releases its gametes around the first quarter moon period of the lunar phase, and since the lunar phase is consistent within the Indo-Pacific Ocean, this species can likely perceive cues from the moon and transcribe them as internal signals. In fact, periodical changes in moonlight intensity are expressed as changes in the plasma levels of melatonin, an endogenous transmitter of environmental light/dark cycles. In addition, the mRNA expression levels of clock genes of neural tissues [Cryptochrome (Cry 3) and Period (Per 2) ] change according {{to changes in the}} lunar cycle. To date, how the lunar cycle may affect endogenous reproductive processes in fish is not fully understood. However, knowledge of lunar spawning periodicity in commercially important species may help in the management of fisheries resources, determining where and when to prohibit fishing (e. g., time and area closures), as well as promoting efficient aquaculture techniques for inducing synchronous spawning.

40|$|<b>Goldlined</b> {{seabream}} Rhabdosargus sarba, is a demersal sparid species {{along the}} Omani {{coast of the}} Arabian Sea and constitutes {{an important part of}} the trawl fisheries. Its maturity, spawning season, length and age at first sexual maturity and sex ratio were studied.

40|$|The behaviour, {{mortality}} rates and plasma electrolyte concentrations of <b>goldlined</b> seabream Rhabdosargus sarba challenged with low dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions was studied in an experimental setup, comprising a control (7. 9 ml/l DO) and two hypoxic (2 ml/l and 1 ml/l DO) treatments. Increased ventilation rates and decreased swimming activity {{were observed in}} hypoxic treatments, but some fish exhibited strenuous avoidance actions. No mortalities were observed after 3 h, 6 h, or 24 h, but 50 % of males and 18 % of females died in the 48 h treatment at 1 ml/l DO. The mean size of surviving fish (305 ± 32. 1 g total weight) was significantly smaller than those that died (425 ± 33. 1 g). The plasma concentrations of Na+, Cl- and Mg 2 + did not vary significantly relative to treatment, exposure time, fish size and gender, or interactions among treatment, time and gender.

40|$|Lunar cycle-associated {{physiology}} {{has been}} found {{in a wide variety of}} organisms. Studies suggest the presence of a circalunar clock in some animals, but the location of the lunar clock is unclear. We previously found lunar-associated expression of transcripts for Cryptochrome 3 gene (SgCry 3) in the brain of a lunar phase-responsive fish, the <b>Goldlined</b> spinefoot (Siganus guttatus). Then we proposed a photoperiodic model for the lunar phase response, in which SgCry 3 might function as a phase-specific light response gene and/or an oscillatory factor in unidentified circalunar clock. In this study, we have developed an anti-SgCRY 3 antibody to identify SgCRY 3 -immunoreactive cells in the brain. We found immunoreactions in the subependymal cells located in the mediobasal region of the diencephalon, a crucial site for photoperiodic seasonal responses in birds. For further assessment of the lunar-responding mechanism and the circalunar clock, we investigated mRNA levels of Cry 3 as well as those of the other clock(-related) genes, Period (Per 2 and Per 4), in S. guttatus reared under nocturnal moonlight interruption or natural conditions. Not only SgCry 3 but SgPer 4 mRNA levels showed lunar phase-dependent variations in the diencephalon without depending on light condition during the night. These results suggest that the expressions of SgCry 3 and SgPer 4 are not directly regulated by moonlight stimulation but endogenously mediated in the brain, and implicate that circadian clock(-related) genes may be involved in the circalunar clock locating within th...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{reproductive}} biology of the <b>goldlined</b> seabream (Rhabdosargus sarba) in the lower Swan River Estuary in Western Australia, focusing particularly on elucidating the factors influencing the duration, timing, and frequency of spawning and on determining potential annual fecundity. Our results demonstrate that 1) Rhabdosargus sarba has indeterminate fecundity, 2) oocyte hydration commences soon after dusk (ca. 18 : 30 h) and is complete by ca. 01 : 30 - 04 : 30 h and 3) fish with ovaries containing migratory nucleus oocytes, hydrated oocytes, or postovulatory follicles were caught between July and November. However, in July and August, their prevalence was low, whereas that of fish with ovaries containing substantial numbers of atretic yolk granule oocytes was high. Thus, spawning activity did not start to peak until September (early spring), when salinities were rising markedly from their winter minima. The prevalence of spawning {{was positively correlated with}} tidal height and was greatest on days when the tide changed from flood to ebb at ca. 06 : 00 h, i. e., just after spawning had ceased. Because our estimate of the average daily prevalence of spawning by females during the spawning season (July to November) was 36. 5 %, individual females were estimated to spawn, on average, at intervals of about 2. 7 days and thus about 45 times during that period. Therefore, because female R. sarba with total lengths of 180, 220, and 260 mm were estimated to have batch fecundities of about 4500, 7700, and 12, 400 eggs, respectively, they had potential annual fecundities of about 204, 300, 346, 100 and 557, 500 eggs, respectively. Because spawning occurs just prior to strong ebb tides, the eggs of R. sarba are likely to be transported out of the estuary into coastal waters where salinities remain at ca. 35 ‰. Such down-stream transport would account for the fact that, although R. sarba exhibits substantial spawning activity in the lower Swan River Estuary, few of its early juveniles are recruited into the nearshore shallow waters of this estuary...|$|R
