5|$|In special relativity, {{energy is}} closely {{connected}} to momentum. Just as {{space and time}} are, in that theory, <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> a more comprehensive entity called spacetime, energy and momentum are merely <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> a unified, four-dimensional quantity that physicists call four-momentum. In consequence, if energy {{is a source of}} gravity, momentum must be a source as well. The same is true for quantities that are directly related to energy and momentum, namely internal pressure and tension. Taken together, in general relativity it is mass, energy, momentum, pressure and tension that serve as sources of gravity: they are how matter tells spacetime how to curve. In the theory's mathematical formulation, all these quantities are but aspects of a more general physical quantity called the energy–momentum tensor.|$|E

5|$|After {{the launch}} of the {{persecution}} campaign in 1999, practitioners outside China began holding frequent protests, rallies, and appeals. These include large-scale marches, demonstrations, and vigils to coincide with notable anniversaries, such as April 25, 1999, and July 20, 1999. Marches typically involve participants holding signs and banners, devoting different sections of the parade to <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the persecution. There is usually a section involving participants wearing only white (symbolizing mourning) and holding photos of those killed in China.|$|E
5|$|Frequently, two Eye-related goddesses appear together, {{representing}} <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the Eye. The juxtaposed deities often {{stand for}} the procreative and aggressive sides of the Eye's character, as Hathor and Sekhmet sometimes do. Wadjet and Nekhbet can stand for Lower and Upper Egypt, respectively, along with the Red Crown and White Crown that represent the two lands. Similarly, Mut, whose main cult center was in Thebes, sometimes served as an Upper Egyptian counterpart of Sekhmet, who was worshipped in Memphis in Lower Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Lowell also {{published}} The Biglow Papers, later {{named by the}} Grolier Club as the most influential book of 1848. The first 1,500 copies sold out within {{a week and a}} second edition was soon issued—though Lowell made no profit, as he had to absorb the cost of stereotyping the book himself. The book presented three main characters, each representing <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> American life and using authentic American dialects in their dialogue. Under the surface, The Biglow Papers was also a denunciation of the Mexican–American War and war in general.|$|E

Pramono, writing for Tempo, notes that the film presents a different side of Dahlan, who is usually portrayed as an old, bearded man who, in his opinion, seems neither modernist nor progressive.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution vests {{the three}} {{branches}} of the state with <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> governmental power. The executive {{is made up of}} the President and the Cabinet, which is headed by the Prime Minister. The Cabinet is accountable to the electorate and is an embodiment of representative democracy. The President is elected by the people to act as a constitutional safeguard in protecting the national reserves and preserving the integrity of the public service. To qualify as a presidential candidate, stringent criteria must be satisfied.|$|E
5|$|The cantata text {{does not}} tell a story but {{reflects}} <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the Holy Spirit, celebrated on Pentecost. It begins with general praise, then concentrates on one line from the Gospel, addresses the Holy Trinity, refers to the Spirit that {{was present at the}} Creation, shows a dialogue between the Soul and the Spirit, and concludes with a stanza from Nicolai's hymn which picks up the topic of unity between God (Spirit) and man, as shown in the dialogue. The text thus proceeds from general to more and more personal and intimate reflection.|$|E

Apart from the stories, the book also contains an extensive art gallery compiled of contributions from Bungie, Marvel and independent sources.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{examples}} of academic, peer-reviewed research concerning <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> Magic: The Gathering.

Another example used online auctions for Magic cards to test revenue outcomes for various auction types. A final example uses probability to examine Magic card-collecting strategies. Using {{a specific set of}} cards in a specialized manner has shown Magic: The Gathering to be Turing complete.|$|E

5|$|A team at Naughty Dog {{designed}} the character appearances, and Amy Hennig {{was the main}} writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The voice actors were given considerable license to improvise the lines and influence character personality, and also performed the motion capture work for their characters. Many of the characters were meant to highlight <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> Drake's personality. Reception to {{the characters in the}} series have been fairly positive, with most commentators focusing on the believable nature of the characters and their interactions with each other. The inclusion of strong female characters has also received praise, though one commentator pointed out that the women still fall into cliché roles. The voice acting has also received acclaim, including two Interactive Achievement Award nominations.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the century, the palette had {{expanded}} to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the earth as defined by different locations of the reservation. Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects. Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally. Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England {{on its way to the}} Navajo. Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. The Navajo obtained black dye through piñon pitch and ashes.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes are not rigid, static structures; {{instead they}} have complex {{internal}} dynamic motions – that is, {{movements of parts}} of the enzyme's structure such as individual amino acid residues, groups of residues forming a protein loop or unit of secondary structure, or even an entire protein domain. These motions {{give rise to a}} conformational ensemble of slightly different structures that interconvert with one another at equilibrium. Different states within this ensemble may be associated with <b>different</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> an enzyme's function. For example, different conformations of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase are associated with the substrate binding, catalysis, cofactor release, and product release steps of the catalytic cycle.|$|E
