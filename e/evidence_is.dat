40|$|The {{avoidance}} {{model in}} patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) hypothesizes that pain and psychological distress lead to avoidance of activities, and thereby to muscle weakness and activity limitations. This paper systematically reviews the scientific evidence for the validity of this avoidance model. A qualitative data synthesis was used to identify levels of <b>evidence.</b> Sixty studies <b>were</b> included. In knee OA, strong <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> found that avoidance of activities is associated with activity limitations via muscle weakness (mediation by muscle weakness), strong <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> found for an association between muscle weakness and activity limitations, and weak <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> found that pain and psychological distress are associated with muscle weakness via avoidance of activities (mediation by avoidance). In hip OA, weak <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> found for mediation by muscle weakness; and strong <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> found for an association between muscle weakness and activity limitations.

When searching for evidence of symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors that would have been used to convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools and skills that would have been used to produce art. Direct <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> difficult to find beyond 40ka, and indirect <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> essentially intangible, thus technological <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> the most fruitful of the three.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: To {{meet the}} {{requirement}} that <b>evidences</b> must <b>be</b> independent for <b>evidences</b> combination in D-S evidence theory when the information processing, the dependence among <b>evidences</b> should <b>be</b> eliminated, so a new combination method of dependent evidences based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is presented. The high-dimensional dependent <b>evidences</b> <b>are</b> replaced by the new low-dimensional independent evidences to reduce the dimensions following the guiding rule of PCA, and then the probability under the new <b>evidences</b> <b>is</b> calculated. The new independent <b>evidences</b> <b>are</b> combined with the combination rules of D-S evidence theory. Compared to existed methods, the dependence in initial <b>evidences</b> <b>is</b> eliminated, {{and the number of}} <b>evidences</b> <b>is</b> reduced, which leads to the simplification of the process of evidence combination. Finally, an example is employed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Preface Group decision-making of experts faces high uncertainty as revealed in fuzziness, randomness, incompleteness and inconstancy of information and knowledge. However, evidence theory can well define some important cognitive concepts, such as, “uncertain ” and “unknown ” and more flexibly measure uncertainty when the information processing. Furthermore, the reasoning mechanism o...|$|R
40|$|To {{provide insight}} into the {{prognostic}} and non-prognostic factors of return to work (RTW) in people with traumatic and non-traumatic acquired brain injury (ABI) who were working before injury. A systematic literature search (1992 - 2008) was performed, including terms for ABI, RTW and prognostic factors. The methodological quality of the studies <b>was</b> determined. <b>Evidence</b> <b>was</b> classified as strong (positive, negative or no), weak or inconsistent. Following classification of the studies, 22 studies <b>were</b> included. Strong <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> found that 'gender' and 'anatomic location' were not associated with RTW after non-traumatic ABI and that both 'injury severity' (classified by the Glascow Coma Scale) and 'suffering from depression' or 'anxiety' were not associated with RTW after traumatic ABI. In addition strong <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> found for the negative prognostic value on RTW of the 'inpatient length of stay', after traumatic ABI. Weak <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> found for the three trainable/treatable factors 'ability to perform activities of daily living', 'residual physical deficits/higher disability level' and 'number of associated injuries'. Strong <b>evidence</b> <b>was</b> found that six variables either had no association or a negative association with RTW.

In 1931, Friedrich Granier was the first to propose that by the time of Philip II's reign, Macedonia had a constitutional government with laws that delegated rights and customary privileges to certain groups, especially to its citizen soldiers, although the majority of evidence for the army's alleged right to appoint a new king and judge cases of treason stems from the reign of Alexander III of Macedon. Pietro de Francisci was the first to refute these ideas and advance the theory that the Macedonian government was an autocracy ruled by the whim of the monarch, although this issue of kingship and governance is still unresolved in academia.|$|E
