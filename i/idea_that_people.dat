5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> could be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired the imagination of the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance of disaster and injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley {{believed}} in the Enlightenment <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> could improve society through the responsible exercise of political power, but she feared that the irresponsible exercise of power would lead to chaos. In practice, her works largely criticise the way 18th-century thinkers such as her parents believed such change could be brought about. The creature in Frankenstein, for example, reads books associated with radical ideals but the education he gains from them is ultimately useless. Shelley's works reveal her as less optimistic than Godwin and Wollstonecraft; she lacks faith in Godwin's theory that humanity could eventually be perfected.|$|E
25|$|In August 1938, Rockwell {{enrolled}} at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island as a philosophy major. In his sociology courses, he rejected equality, the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{were made by}} their environment, {{and the idea that}} all human beings had the same potential in life. He debated with fellow students over topics such as social themes in popular novels.|$|E
5000|$|Motivational: <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> adopt {{because they}} {{perceive}} some self-interest in adopting them. Strictly speaking, motivationally transmitted memes do not self-propagate, but {{this mode of}} transmission often occurs in association with memes self-replicated in the efficiency parental, proselytic and preservational modes.|$|R
50|$|The {{notion of}} {{consumer}} networks expresses the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people’s</b> embeddedness in social networks affects their behavior as consumers. Interactions within consumer networks such as information exchange and imitation can affect demand and market outcomes in ways not {{considered in the}} neoclassical theory of consumer choice.|$|R
5000|$|He {{believed}} that religious experiences can have [...] "morbid origins" [...] in brain pathology {{and can be}} irrational but nevertheless are largely positive.

25|$|The story also {{speaks of}} mob {{psychology}} and the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> can abandon reason and act cruelly {{if they are}} part of a large group of people behaving in the same manner. The idyllic setting of the story also demonstrates that violence and evil can take place anywhere and in any context. This also shows how people can turn on each other so easily.|$|E
25|$|In the study, {{researchers}} created {{two versions}} of the same news story – one with compelling negative images and one without. Participants were asked to watch a 20 minute news video (half of the participants saw the negative images and the other half did not) and an additional ten-minute video. They were instructed to pay attention because they would be tested afterwards. A follow up survey was sent 6 to 7 weeks later to measure memory and recall from the news video. The results support the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> better remember information that comes after a negative event. Respondents who viewed the negative images better remembered {{the second half of the}} newscast than the part preceding the negative images. The findings of this study further support the media equation assumption that mediated experiences are the same as natural experiences.|$|E
25|$|Our {{ideas about}} God are {{important}} indicators {{of how we}} view the world. According to Adler, these ideas have changed over time, as our {{vision of the world}} – and our place in it – has changed. Consider this example that Adler offers: the traditional belief that people were placed deliberately on earth as God's ultimate creation is being replaced with the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> have evolved by natural selection. This coincides with a view of God not as a real being, but as an abstract representation of nature's forces. In this way our view of God has changed from one that was concrete and specific to one that is more general. From Adler's vantage point, this is a relatively ineffective perception of God because it is so general that it fails to convey a strong sense of direction and purpose.|$|E

40|$|Designing robots, virtual creatures, {{artificial}} companions {{and social}} artifacts {{can really be}} rather challenging sometimes. Forms and shapes <b>that</b> <b>people</b> are familiar with seems to inevitably correlate with their interpretation and interaction.

25|$|Though the {{relationship}} between smoking and schizophrenia is well established, a factor {{to be considered in}} this relationship {{is the role of the}} tobacco industry. Research based on internal industry documents shows a concerted effort by the industry to promote belief that people with schizophrenia need to smoke and that it is dangerous for them to quit. Such promotion includes monitoring or supporting research that endorsed the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> with schizophrenia are uniquely immune to the health consequences of smoking (since proved false) and that tobacco is needed for people with schizophrenia to self-medicate. The industry also provided cigarettes to hospital wards and supported efforts to block hospital-based smoking bans. Although this does not discredit the effects of nicotine in schizophrenia, it is argued that the efforts of the tobacco industry slowed the decline in smoking prevalence in people with schizophrenia as well as the development of clinical policies to promote smoking cessation.|$|E
25|$|Some current genetic {{research}} supports the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{living in the}} British Isles are likely mainly descended from the indigenous European Paleolithic (Old Stone Age hunter gatherers) population (about 80%), with a smaller Neolithic (New Stone Age farmers) input (about 20%). Paleolithic Europeans {{seem to have been}} a homogeneous population, possibly due to a population bottleneck (or near-extinction event) on the Iberian peninsula, where a small human population is thought to have survived the glaciation, and expanded into Europe during the Mesolithic. The assumed genetic imprint of Neolithic incomers is seen as a cline, with stronger Neolithic representation in the east of Europe and stronger Paleolithic representation in the west of Europe. Most in Wales today regard themselves as modern Celts, claiming a heritage back to the Iron Age tribes, which themselves, based on modern genetic analysis, would appear to have had a predominantly Paleolithic and Neolithic indigenous ancestry. When the Roman legions departed Britain around 400, a Romano-British culture remained in the areas the Romans had settled, and the pre-Roman cultures in others.|$|E
500|$|The <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{are drawn}} to professions that fit their name was {{suggested}} by psychologist Carl Jung, citing as an example Sigmund Freud who studied pleasure and whose surname means [...] "joy". A few recent empirical {{studies have indicated that}} certain professions are disproportionately represented by people with appropriate surnames (and sometimes given names), though the methods of these studies have been challenged. One explanation for nominative determinism is implicit egotism, which states that humans have an unconscious preference for things they associate with themselves. An alternative explanation is genetic: a person might be named Smith or Taylor because that was originally their occupation, and they would pass on their genes to their descendants, including an aptitude for activities involving strength in the case of Smith, or dexterity in the case of Taylor.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects in this stream of research relates {{to the fact that there}} is scarce scientific support for the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people’s</b> level of happiness can change for the better (Lyubomirsky et al. 2005). These authors advance that very few interventions on happiness studies have been carried out to understand the “possibility of becoming happier”. In addition, the conception of happiness that underlies the existing studies is not always explicit.|$|R

I joined Dad's Army when I was sixteen, and if the Germans had arrived, I tell you, I could use a bayonet, a rifle, a revolver, and if I'd seen a German officer having a meal I'd have tossed a grenade through the window.

Betty Driver said of the range's launch: [...] "Betty Turpin's hotpots have become something of an institution at the Rover's and she's very proud of her reputation for good, wholesome food.

[...] Driver discussed her astonishment at the general level of interest in her character's hotpots, disclosing: [...] "I was on a cruise on the QE2 a few weeks ago, and everyone was asking me about it.

500|$|Dixon {{took part}} in series 5 of [...] TV show Strictly Come Dancing in 2007, partnered with {{professional}} dancer Matthew Cutler. Dixon was at first hesitant to join, fearing that snobbery within the music industry would damage her career. In a later interview, she said, [...] "there's always this preconceived <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> do reality TV shows {{because they want to}} kick-start their careers whereas I was actually worried that it would affect it." [...] They had been the favourite from the third week, receiving the most points from the judges on numerous occasions. Dixon herself gained high appraisal from the judges, even being likened to a [...] "young Josephine Baker" [...] by Bruno Tonioli. They received 4.5 million votes in the final, beating actor Matt Di Angelo and professional dancer Flavia Cacace to win the glitter disco ball. Dixon is currently the most successful contestant to ever take part in Strictly Come Dancing, with an average point score of 36.5/40, the highest average score from any contestant to ever take part in the show.|$|E
30|$|It {{amazes me}} sometimes, when I sit in our {{collaboration}} {{meetings at the}} <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> come up with.

500|$|Before McCoy {{is arrested}} by security, he {{attempts}} to charter a spaceflight to Genesis in a bar. The scene opens with two officers playing a World War I-era dogfight video game. The wireframe biplanes were created using black lines on clear paper printouts placed on an overlay cell. [...] "It was really just a gag shot", effects artist Charlie Mullen explained, [...] "the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> in the future would be playing an old war game." [...] To accommodate the effect, Correll had to use {{a large amount of}} exposure without making the bar appear overlit. Much of the lighting was provided by tables rigged with fluorescent tubes to provide an effect different {{from other parts of the}} film. Correll could not add smoke to the scene to enhance the bar [...] "feel", because the disturbed atmosphere would have made ILM's game hard to insert. The scene was intended to end in a barroom brawl when security tried to take McCoy into custody; Nimoy decided that [...] "it didn't feel right" [...] and there was not enough time or money to achieve the scene successfully.|$|E
500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either. I think of all the things that I still want to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them."

500|$|In December 2014, Jed Whedon {{explained}} {{the benefits of}} introducing a society of superhuman characters in the Inhumans, saying [...] "One of the things that, early on {{was very important to}} us last season was, there were so few people in the Cinematic Universe who had powers. Really, only two humans had powers, Captain America and the Hulk. We had to be very responsible—we didn't want to dive into this show and have a new one every week, and have it feel like we disregarded everything that they spent so much money and time building in the films. Along those same lines, the origin of a power is always a complex thing—Marvel cares about it feeling grounded, it feeling scientific at some level. Even on Thor, he says, [...] "In our world, magic and science are the same thing." [...] So this is a way for us to sort of open up our world. It's a way to introduce, into the MCU, the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> can be born with a power. They don't have to be engineered in a lab, they don't need to have some freak accident with a vat of acid. They can be born with this. That's sort of a gamechanger, not just on our show, but in the cinematic universe".|$|E

Joyner believes that Brooker implicates the viewer with the story's credits scene, noting [...] "we're the ones with the smartphones, passively absorbing abuses to human rights and decency, and yet revelling in the image from the safety of the screen". Jeffery and Parker affirmed it contains the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> are preferring to document life rather than living it, as exemplified by [...] "people who see violence break out ... and decide to film it rather than intervene." [...] Leigh Alexander of Boing Boing said the episode reflects how violence is easily accessed on the Internet and quickly arouses people's attention. She noted, [...] "you can view the episode as a critique of all kinds of themes: Mob mentality, reality television, even the complicated treatment of women in the justice system ... Primarily, though, this episode is a critique of our deep, often-unexamined mass desensitization, or at least a dread portent of its potential to grow. It aims to ask: To what extent can you stand by and watch horror before you are complicit, punishable?" ...|$|E
500|$|Slay Tracks found {{unexpected}} attention {{after the}} Leeds, England-based band The Wedding Present covered [...] "Box Elder" [...] {{on their own}} 1990 EP, Brassneck.

[...] However, his opinion of the cover and its significance later changed: [...] "It was so cool that some band from the UK wanted to cover this obscure, horribly recorded song.
