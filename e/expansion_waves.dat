An idealized <b>expansion</b> <b>wave,</b> an idealized inlet port, and an idealized compression stage are considered. It is found that area variation does not have a very significant effect on the <b>expansion</b> <b>wave,</b> nor on the compression stage. For the <b>expansion</b> <b>wave,</b> increasing the passage area in the flow direction has the same effect as a diffuser, so that the flow emerges at a lower velocity than it would for the constant area case. This could be advantageous. The inlet is strongly affected by the area variation, as it changes the strength of the hammer shock wave, thereby changing the pressure behind it. In this case, reduction in the passage area in the flow direction leads to increased pressure.

We present {{a new approach}} with wave intensity analysis to revisit and explain counterpulsation principles. MethodsIn an acute porcine model, a standard intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in descending aorta in 4 pigs. We measured pressure and velocity with probes in left anterior descending artery and aorta during and without intra-aortic balloon pump assistance. Wave intensities of aortic and left coronary waves were derived from pressure and flow measurements with synchronization correction. ResultsWe identified predominating waves in counterpulsation. In the aorta, during diastolic augmentation, intra-aortic balloon inflation generated a backward compression wave, with a “pushing” effect toward the aortic root that translated to a forward compression wave into coronary circulation. During systolic unloading, intra-aortic balloon pump deflation generated a backward <b>expansion</b> <b>wave</b> that “sucked” blood from left coronary bed into the aorta. While this backward <b>expansion</b> <b>wave</b> translated to reduced left ventricular afterload, the “sucking” effect resulted in left coronary blood steal, as demonstrated by a forward <b>expansion</b> <b>wave</b> in left anterior descending coronary flow. The waves were sensitive to inflation and deflation timing, with just 25 ms delay from standard deflation timing leading to weaker forward <b>expansion</b> <b>wave</b> and less coronary regurgitation. ConclusionsIntra-aortic balloon pumps generate backward-traveling waves that predominantly drive aortic and coronary blood flow during counterpulsation. Wave intensity analysis of arterial circulations may provide a mechanism to explain diastolic augmentation and systolic unloading of intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation...|$|R

Reliable detonation requires raising a minimum volume of explosive to temperatures and pressures at which detonation starts. If energy is deposited at a single point, it can radiate away in the explosive in all directions in rarefaction or <b>expansion</b> <b>waves,</b> and only a small volume is efficiently heated or compressed.

40|$|Why {{does not}} an <b>expansion</b> shock <b>wave</b> {{exist in a}} gaseous medium in nature? The reason has been widely {{believed}} to be the irreversibility in nature, while an obvious demonstration for this belief has not been accomplished yet. In order to resolve the question from a microscopic viewpoint, an implosion process dual to an explosion process was investigated by means of the molecular-dynamics method (MD). To this aim, we employed a "bit-reversible algorithm (Bit MD) " that was completely time-reversible in a microscopic viewpoint and was free from any round-off error. Here we show that, through a dual implosion simulation (i. e., a time-reversible simulation of the explosion), a kind of <b>expansion</b> shock <b>wave</b> is successfully formed in the Bit MD simulation. Furthermore, we show that when the controlled noise is intentionally added to the Bit MD, the <b>expansion</b> shock <b>wave</b> disappears dramatically and turns into an isentropic <b>expansion</b> <b>wave,</b> even if the noise is extremely small. Since the controlled noise gives rise to the irreversibility in the Bit MD simulation, it can be concluded that the irreversibility in the system prohibits the <b>expansion</b> shock <b>wave</b> from appearing in the system. © 2007 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

A full oscillation of the Helmholtz resonance occurs before the exhaust valve is closed, {{and to increase}} low-speed torque, large amplitude exhaust pressure waves are artificially induced. This is achieved by partial closing of an internal valve within the exhaust—the EXUP valve—at {{the point where the}} four primary pipes from the cylinders join. This junction point essentially behaves as an artificial atmosphere, hence the alteration of the pressure at this point controls the behavior of reflected waves at this sudden increase in area discontinuity. Closing the valve increases the local pressure, thus inducing the formation of larger amplitude negative reflected <b>expansion</b> <b>waves.</b> This enhances low speed torque up to a speed at which the loss due to increased back pressure outweighs the EXUP tuning effect.

At low engine speeds the wave pressure within the pipe network is low. A full oscillation of the Helmholtz resonance occurs before the exhaust valve is closed, and to increase low-speed torque, large-amplitude exhaust pressure waves are artificially induced. This is achieved by partial closing of an internal butterfly valve within the exhaust {{at the point where}} the primary pipes from the cylinders join. This junction point essentially behaves as an artificial atmosphere. The alteration of the pressure at this point controls the behavior of reflected waves at this sudden increase in area discontinuity. Closing the valve increases the local pressure, inducing the formation of larger-amplitude negative reflected <b>expansion</b> <b>waves.</b> A servo motor controlled by the ECU opens and shuts the valve. The valve goes from being almost fully closed at idle speed, through to fully open at higher engine speeds.

The experimentation only considered variation in the shock tube pressure ratio whereas the simulation varied both independent parameters. A Navier-Stokes solver with Menters SST k-! turbulence model was found to adequately model the ow eld. A number of major ow features were identi ed, that occurred {{in the vicinity of the}} 90 corner. The ow features identi ed were: a shear layer which originated by ow separation near the apex of the 90 corner, a separation bubble that remained attached to a wall boundary in absence of rig-dependent e ects, and a re ected compression wave due to perturbation signals generated by di raction of the <b>expansion</b> <b>wave.</b> For a narrow-width <b>expansion</b> <b>wave</b> existing prior to di raction, it was found that after di raction a re ected compression wave developed which would steepen into an outwardly propagating, weak, cylindrical shock wave.

The wake region, through schlieren imaging, was found to consist of two distinct layers. The experimental results through shadowgraph and schlieren imaging have indicated large-scale turbulent structures within the separation bubble and the shear layer.

40|$|Most of {{the second}} year of our {{research}} program focused on exploring the potentially favorable the effects of <b>expansion</b> <b>waves</b> on homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, which is formed downstream of a grid. <b>Expansion</b> <b>waves</b> are associated with compressible flows and may reduce the drag over airfoils by suppressing turbulence.

40|$|We reexamine both numerically and {{analytically}} {{the collapse}} of the singular isothermal sphere in the context of low-mass star formation. We consider the case where the onset of collapse is initiated by some arbitrary process which is accompanied by a central output of either heat or kinetic energy. We find two classes of numerical solutions describing this manner of collapse. The first approaches in time the <b>expansion</b> <b>wave</b> solution of Shu, while the second class is characterized by an ever-decreasing central accretion rate and the presence of an outwardly propagating weak shock. The collapse solution which represents the dividing case between these two classes is determined analytically by a similarity analysis. This solution shares with the <b>expansion</b> <b>wave</b> solution the properties that the gas remains stationary with an r(exp - 2) density profile at large radius and that, at small radius, the gas free-falls onto a nascent core at a constant rate which depends only on the isothermal sound speed. This accretion rate is a factor of approx. 0. 1 that predicted by the <b>expansion</b> <b>wave</b> solution. This reduction {{is due in part to}} the presence of a weak shock which propagates outward at 1. 26 times the sound speed. Gas in the postshock region first moves out subsonically but is then decelerated and begins to collapse. The existence of two classes of numerical collapse solutions is explained in terms of the instability to radial perturbations of the analytic solution. Collapse occurring in the manner described by some of our solutions would eventually unbind a finite-sized core. However, this does not constitute a violation of the instability properties of the singular isothermal sphere which is unstable both to collapse and to expansion. To emphasize this, we consider a purely expanding solution for isothermal spheres. This solution is found to be self-similar and results in a uniform density core in the central regions of the gas. Our solutions may be relevant to the 'luminosity' problem of protostellar cores since the predicted central accretion rates are significantly reduced relative to that of the <b>expansion</b> <b>wave</b> solution. Furthermore, our calculations indicate that star-forming cloud cores are not very tightly bound and that modest disturbances can easily result in both termination of infall and dispersal of unaccreted material...|$|R

The inlet has a sound performance in terms of total pressure recovery and flow coefficient owing to its compact design to decrease the negative influences of shock waves. However, it still remains a tough task to design the inlet for the time being. It is here introduced in the paper the concept of <b>expansion</b> <b>waves</b> to simplify the design process of isentropic inlet. It is known to all that the air captured by the inlet will gradually decrease its speed due to influence of the countless numbers of compression waves. However, as we observe in the opposite direction, the air will accelerate its speed gradually in <b>expansion</b> <b>waves</b> flow field. One thing will remain the same in the preceding two flow situations, namely, streamline. Based on the idea, the profile traced in <b>expansion</b> <b>waves</b> flow field can yield the compression surface of isentropic inlet. <b>Expansion</b> <b>waves</b> are phenomena that are very common in supersonic flows. Certain types of <b>expansion</b> <b>waves</b> in a steady uniform parallel two-dimensional flow, which are called Prandtl-Meyer waves, can be analyzed by simple equations. With the joint solution of the MOC equations and Prandtl-Meyer equations, the supersonic <b>expansion</b> <b>waves</b> flow field, serving as the base flow field of designed inlet, can be obtained precisely. Next, the introduction of bilinear interpolation method allows the calculation of each point on a streamline starting from a given initial point. Finally, a streamline-traced sketch, derived from the above base flow field, will be the desired inlet forebody. The following two-dimensional numerical simulation conducted accordingly indicates the actual performance well satisfy the designed state. The fact that the designed inlet has a good performance in terms of total pressure recovery means that the design method is practical and feasible, and broadens applications of design method of such inlets...|$|E
