40|$|The {{objective}} of the project entitled ''Utilization of Lightweight Materials Made from Coal Gasification Slags'' was to demonstrate the technical and economic viability of manufacturing low-unit-weight products from coal gasification slags {{which can be used}} as substitutes for conventional lightweight and ultra-lightweight aggregates. In Phase I, the technology developed by Praxis to produce lightweight aggregates from slag (termed SLA) was applied to produce a large batch (10 tons) of expanded slag using pilot direct-fired rotary kilns and a fluidized bed calciner. The expanded products were characterized using basic characterization and application-oriented tests. Phase II involved the demonstration and evaluation of the use of expanded slag aggregates to produce a number of end-use applications including lightweight roof tiles, lightweight precast products (e. g., masonry blocks), structural concrete, insulating concrete, loose <b>fill</b> <b>insulation,</b> and as a substitute for expanded perlite and vermiculite in horticultural applications. Prototypes of these end-use applications were made and tested with the assistance of commercial manufacturers. Finally, the economics of expanded slag production was determined and compared with the alternative of slag disposal. Production of value-added products from SLA has a significant potential to enhance the overall gasification process economics, especially when the avoided costs of disposal are considered...|$|E
40|$|Temperatures and {{relative}} humidities in ventilated and unventilated attics. Measurements and calculations in attics with loose <b>fill</b> <b>insulation</b> of mineral wool and cellulose fibre In well-insulated houses with a ventilated attic {{there is a}} risk for condensation and high RH during the winter. One way to lower the RH and thereby decrease the risk of damage by mildew and rot is to decrease the outdoor air ventilation of the attic. This is possible only in cases where the roof has no air leakage from the inside. This means that the ceiling must be airtight and that there always is an underpreassure compared to the attic. Measurements have been made in a test roof space employing six different forms of structures. Two structures, one with mineral wool insulation, the other with cellulose fibre insulation, are ventilated with fans to a degree of 2 ach, two structures are naturally ventilated and two are not ventilated at all. The study shows that low ventilation gives a drier climate in the attic and that lower ventilation rate gives smaller differences in RH during day and night. There is only a slight difference in performance of the attics with cellulose fiber insulations compared to those with mineral wool insulation. Four researchers have made calculations of temperature and RH outgoing from outdoor climate and data of materials and constructions of the six structures. In some cases the agreement with measured results was very good, in other cases not so good...|$|E

40|$|Biorefinery of {{sunflower}} whole {{plant was}} performed successfully using a thermo-mechano-chemical twin-screw reactor. This {{led to the}} aqueous extraction of oil and other biopolymers like proteins, pectins and non pectic sugars. It resulted in the overall fractionation of biomass, thus allowing a complete valorization of the input. This biorefinery process was not only efficient {{but it was also}} environment-friendly. In addition, it contributed to the production of different end products for various industrial applications. Firstly, the hydrophilic phase will be recycled to the process. Secondly, the densest oil-in-water emulsion is a promising candidate for the formulation of cosmetic creams. Thirdly, the upper hydrophobic phase will be usable for the waterproofing treatment of the surface of agromaterials by coating. Its demixing will also lead to the production of proteins with tensioactive properties. These will serve for the food industry. Lastly, the cake was a mixture of plasticized proteins and lignocellulosic fibers. It was thus considered as a natural composite. Its molding into cohesive fiberboards was conducted successfully using both thermopressing and compression molding processes. The self-bonded boards with high density will be suitable for use as load bearing boards in dry conditions (floor underlayers, interior partitions, furniture, etc.). Positioned in walls and ceilings, boards with medium and low density will contribute to the heat insulation of buildings. In addition, the bulk cake will be also usable as a loose <b>fill</b> <b>insulation</b> material. As proposed, this flow chart thus allows a valorization for all fractions originating from the twin-screw reactor...|$|E
40|$|The {{assembly}} joints {{of modem}} solid rocket motor cases are generally sealed using conventional O-ring type seals. The 5500 + F combustion gases produced by rocket motors are kept {{a safe distance}} away from the seals by thick layers of phenolic insulation. Special compounds are used to <b>fill</b> <b>insulation</b> gaps {{leading up to the}} seals to prevent a direct flowpath to them. Design criteria require that the seals should not experience torching or charring during operation, or their sealing ability would be compromised. On limited occasions, NASA has observed charring of the primary O-rings of the Space Shuttle solid rocket nozzle assembly joints due to parasitic leakage paths opening up in the gap-fill compounds during rocket operation. NASA is investigating different approaches for preventing torching or charring of the primary O-rings. One approach is to implement a braided rope seal upstream of the primary O-ring to serve as a thermal barrier that prevents the hot gases from impinging on the O-ring seals. This paper presents flow, resiliency, and thermal resistance for several types of NASA rope seals braided out of carbon fibers. Burn tests were performed to determine the time to burn through each of the seals when exposed to the flame of an oxyacetylene torch (5500 F), representative of the 5500 F solid rocket motor combustion temperatures. Rope seals braided out of carbon fibers endured the flame for over six minutes, three times longer than solid rocket motor burn time. Room and high temperature flow tests are presented for the carbon seals for different amounts of linear compression. Room temperature compression tests were performed to assess seal resiliency and unit preloads as a function of compression. The thermal barrier seal was tested in a subscale "char" motor test in which the seal sealed an intentional defect in the gap insulation. Temperature measurements indicated that the seal blocked 2500 F combustion gases on the upstream side with very little temperature rise on the downstream side...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{was carried}} out in order to evaluate three differing approaches to achieving low energy buildings using improved methods of traditional masonry construction. Spiralling greenhouse emissions and fuel costs have focused the industry towards the delivery of low energy buildings. Cavity wall Masonry construction is the favoured method of construction currently used in the construction of dwellings in Ireland. Partial fill rigid insulation which is installed within the cavity is a technique which has been seen to result in large gaps between the design performance levels and actual performance levels. Impending requirements to further reduce heat loss will result in restricted use of traditional methods in the future. The inherent structural properties of this method are reaching their limits due to the requirement of more comprehensive widths of insulation material within the cavity. A comprehensive examination of published literature {{was carried out}} in order to address the causes of the performance gap relevant to this topic. The research will assess the performance issues with the comparative approaches through the literature review and primary research in order to determine if the use of either approach could contribute to narrowing the performance gap. Primary research will be gathered in the form of structured interviews with Industry professionals with expertise in both practical aspects and theoretical based levels of expertise. The results indicate that Solid Wall Construction with External Insulation is seen to be the approach which could contribute to the delivery of low energy buildings in Ireland on a more consist basis from the three options. The primary reasons for this are owing to the simplicity of the construction form and division of trade responsibility. However as this approach lacks familiarity, it is believed that a training and skills issued would firstly need to be addressed as it is a relatively new technique. One of the most problematic areas concerned with partial <b>fill</b> <b>insulation</b> is the issue of thermal passage that occur. Insulating cavity walls internally is seen to increase construction times and involves multiple layers with sequencing issues and lack of accountability in addition to the increased hygrothermal risk associated with insulating internally.

40|$|Many {{articles}} of daily use {{are made of}} or contain polyurethane (PU), for instance clothes, mattresses, furniture <b>filling,</b> <b>insulation</b> materials or automotive interiors. Polyurethanes (PUs), as most synthetic materials can emit volatile organic compounds (VOC), some {{of which could be}} unpleasant odorous and may reduce the consumer acceptance or cause consumer anxiety. Therefore, the aim of the PU-industries was the development of low emission and low odor PU products. The prerequisite in order to do this was to reveal the odorant sources and to understand their formation pathways during manufacturing. In contrast to other plastics, PUs are not commercially available as pellets/granulate or semi finished products for subsequent processing. PUs are produced in situ in the PUfactory by the exothermal polyaddition reaction of a polyol and an isocyanate component in presence of catalysts and additives like blowing agents, cross linkers, surfactants, flame retardants, pigments or fillers in order to achieve specific end product properties. Therefore, PU properties and corresponding material emissions are influenced by both the main PU components (polyol and isocyante), additives and catalysts as well as by production conditions like the reaction temperature. In order to reveal the causes for odor formation during the PU manufacturing process, the raw materials and additives of a conspicuous odorous PU product were sensorially evaluated. The odor evaluation showed that exclusively low odor raw materials and additives were used...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} Greek perlite deposits crop {{out on the}} islands of Milos (Provatas and Trachilas areas), Kimolos, and Kos, Aegean Sea, which are currently under exploitation. More than 200 specimens of raw perlite were collected from these perlite deposits and were subjected to physical, chemical, petrographic and expansion tests. The perlite deposits have been formed by a phreatomagmatic eruption, which is the last event of volcanic activity on the islands. Most of the deposits comprise the sand, ash, and perlitic fragments' formation, the perlitic lahar, the perlite beds, and the perlitic dome. The first formation is the precursor of the eruption, and {{is followed by the}} perlitic lahar, which is result of lava fragmentation, and the perlite beds, which are slow-cooled lavas. The perlitic dome penetrates into the perlitic succession. Vesiculation has taken place in the perlite beds, producing the pumiceous textures of perlite. Dacite fragments are found in the perlitic lahar, as well. Perlite consists of more than 70 % of high silica and alkalies glass. Phenocrysts of quartz, feldspar (mainly plagioclase of oligoclase composition), biotite, opaque minerals (magnetite, ilmenite) and apatite are also present. Various types of perlite, rich in quartz, feldspar, tridimite, and cristobalite, were identified. Two main modes of water are found in perlite. Differences in chemical composition of perlites indicate four individual parent magma sources. The main chemical variation is present in alkalis and Ba, Sr, Rb, and the R. E. E. The Eu anomaly is a common characteristic for the studied perlites. The relationship between glass and perlite composition is given. The specific gravity of Greek perlites ranges between 1. 50 and 3. 00 gr/cm 3, the p. H. between 6. 5 and 8. 5, the surface area is around 3. 00 m 2 /gr. All the studied perlites indicate good expansibility, obtaining low loose bulk density values (20 - 240 kgr/m 3), low percent of nonexpansibles (1 - 7 %), large particle size, low compaction resistance, high water (15 - 35 %) and oil (400 - 2200 cc/ 100 gr) absorption, and surface area values (6 - 13 m 2 /gr). The expanded perlite is chemical inert. A new phase rich in Cr and Fe, a pyroxene, and cristobalite are determined in the expanded product. Four different stages in the expansion process are determined by the scanning electron microscope. The phenocryst proportion and grain size contribute to the expansion results. On the other hand, the chemical and the mineral composition does not affect the expansibility of perlite, perhaps because the range of composition is small. The studied perlite is of good quality and is therefore suitable for filter aid, concrete and plaster aggregate, loose <b>fill</b> <b>insulation,</b> cryogenic, horticulture, animal feed, fire protection, and thermal insulation purposes...|$|E

40|$|Polyolefin {{degradation}} mechanisms under thermal, photo, and hydrolytic conditions, {{and their}} mechanisms {{have been well}} established. However, less is understood about the degradation of polyolefins under the presence of electric fields, water and metal ions. In this research the chemical components in hundreds of the local degraded regions (water treed regions) of service-aged and lab-aged cable and slab specimens were investigated by micro-FTIR difference spectra technique. It was found that water and carboxylate ions are the major chemical components in treed regions. The presence of carboxylate ions was confirmed by model compounds, several well-designed solid state chemical derivatizations and electrolytic cell test of PE films. Sulfate ions, esters and trace amount of ketones were also found in some trees. Based upon the generality of the phenomenon established, an electrochemical degradation mechanism for polyolefins is proposed. The growth of water tree {{is associated with the}} electro-oxidation of polyolefins which produces and converts ketones to carboxylate ions. The potential application of the proposed mechanism is to help design appropriate 2 ̆ 2 retardants 2 ̆ 2 to suppress the degradation process. ^ While much of the work is reported about the unfilled PE and crosslinked low density polyethylene (XLPE), the tree morphology and their initiation sites mineral-filled XLPE and ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) are not well understood. Therefore, the differences and similarities of the 2 ̆ 2 treeing 2 ̆ 2 phenomenon were also studied for the two systems using cable and slab specimens. It was found, by using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis and differential scanning calorimetry, that the trees are fewer and larger in the <b>filled</b> <b>insulations</b> than in unfilled XLPE. The initiation sites of water trees contain transition metal elements such as iron, vanadium, zinc, and titanium. The role of these metal ions in the growth of water tree is explained by electrooxidation catalysis. In filled systems, high water uptake and the presence of metal ions are believed to be associated with few trees of relatively large tree size. ...|$|R
