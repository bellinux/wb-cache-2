5000|$|In the United Kingdom, {{especially}} in England and Wales, the slipper {{was a common}} implement for administering corporal punishment in schools for students of both genders and all ages. In schools that used the cane as the ultimate penalty, the slipper {{was seen as a}} less severe alternative for punishing less serious misconduct. In some mixed schools the slipper was used on girls and the cane was reserved for boys. [...] "Slipper" [...] is a misnomer, as the usual item of footwear used was the plimsoll, or <b>gymshoe</b> or tennis shoe, with a fabric upper and a heavy rubber or synthetic sole. This could deliver a very painful stroke, depending on the force with which it was used, and the size and flexibility of the particular slipper; a size 11, well-worn, flexible slipper would deliver more sting than one that was new and stiff. Though not a slipper in the usual sense of the term, the implement used was invariably referred to as [...] "the slipper" [...] by teachers and pupils alike, presumably on account of its similarity to the type of carpet slipper used for parental punishments. [...] A typical gym shoe, which was actually used in a school in Lincolnshire, is shown on the left.|$|E
5000|$|In 1856 {{a wealthy}} US entrepreneur, Henry Lee Norris, {{established}} the North British Rubber Company in the {{buildings of the}} former Castle Silk Mill alongside the Union Canal. The company's Castle Mill premises eventually covered 20 acres {{of land in the}} area and employed thousands of workers over five generations in manufacturing a variety of products from galoshes and rubber Wellington boots to solid rubber wheels for Thomson steam traction engines (after 1870), pneumatic tyres (after 1890) and hot-water bottles. The company's design for trench boots, which was officially chosen by the War Office during the Great War, led to a lucrative government contract which saw the firm supplying up to 2750 pairs a day, reaching a total of 1.2 million pairs {{by the end of the}} war. Similar contracts resulted in the production of 1/4 of a million pairs of <b>gymshoes,</b> 47,000 pairs of heavy snow boots for the French Army, 16,000 tyres and 2.5 million feet of hosepipe. The Second World War brought another boom with the production of millions of civilian gas masks and barrage-balloon fabric. In 1958, the company produced Britain's first traffic cones for the M6 motorway. The United States Rubber Company gradually took control of the company. The United States Rubber Company was renamed Uniroyal in 1961 and North British took on this name when eventually taken-over in 1966. In that year, Uniroyal relocated the tyre manufacture to Newbridge, then outside Edinburgh. In 1957 Castle Mills began the production of Royalite thermoplastic sheeting. In 1967 Royalite production was moved to a new factory adjacent to the tyre plant at Newbridge. The manufacture of PowerGrip drive belts was relocated to the former Arrol-Johnston factory at Heathhall, Dumfries around 1970. All that remained at Castle Mills was the hose factory which continued until its closure in late 1973.|$|R
