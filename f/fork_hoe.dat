40|$|Balinese {{farmer in}} doing their daily {{activities}} in agricultural work still relay on their hand tools. One {{of the hand}} tools used is the hoe. In fact there are two type of <b>hoe,</b> <b>fork</b> type and single blade hoe.   The single blade hoe is very rare used for hoeing in wet rice field. Farmer chose the fork type one. Therefore, a {{study was conducted to}} compare the efficacy of those two hoes. Twenty farmers were participated voluntarily. They were divided into two groups evenly. The first group hoeing using the <b>fork</b> type <b>hoe,</b> and the second group using the single blade one. They hoeing in the same area of rice field (wet rice field) from 07. 00 until 12. 00. The parameter measured were resting and working heart rate, product and productivity, musculoskeletal disorders, and the deep of soil hoed. The student-t test was applied to analyses the results. The results found are: a) the working heart rate, the product and productivities were 111. 1 ± 14. 66 bpm; 127. 74 ± 9. 15 m 2; 0. 54 ± 0. 00 and 110. 2 ± 13. 88 bpm; 126. 88 ± 8. 79 m 2; 0. 54 ± 0. 00  for first group and second group, respectively. The MSD and the deep of soil hoed were 4. 50 ± 1. 97; 30. 0 ± 2. 54 cm and   4. 45 ± 2. 03; 29. 64 ± 1. 75 cm for both groups. There are no significant different found statistically. Therefore, it is concluded that the efficacy of single blade hoe is similar to the <b>fork</b> type <b>hoe</b> for hoeing the wet rice field in the tropic. For further study it is recommended to use these two hoes for hoeing in the dry soil. [MEDICINA 2009; 40 : 43 - 6]. </p...|$|R

Although it is the dominate income industry, commerce, education and other services are influential. Agricultural activities associated with seed, grafting, fertilizer, liming, animal feed and their derivatives have been economic successes.

40|$|In South Kivu (RD-Congo), Rwanda and Burundi, bananas (AAA-EA, Musa spp.) are {{frequently}} intercropped with annual crops, of which common bush beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) {{are the most}} common. At the onset of each rainy season, the soil in between the bananas is tilled manually using a hand <b>hoe</b> or a <b>fork</b> up to 10 - 15 cm depth to prepare the seedbed. Farmers believe that tillage favors the bean performance, {{but it may also}} seriously damage the superficial banana root system. This may negatively affect banana productivity and nematode and fungal disease pressure on banana roots. The aim of the research was {{to assess the impact of}} tillage on the banana root systems and growth 12 months after the application of no-till. We monitored characteristics of primary roots (biomass, length, nematode infection rate) in the topsoil (0 - 20 cm) on a monthly basis for a 6 months period in three on-farm trials. Mature banana plantations were subjected to no-till, tillage using a hoe, and tillage using a <b>forked</b> <b>hoe.</b> The latter was to test whether the fork would cause less damage to the root systems than conventional tillage. Immediately after tillage, hand hoe tillage reduced the root biomass by 85 % on average in the top 10 cm compared to no-till plots, with no significant differences between tillage methods. There was no effect of tillage below this depth. Both in terms of length and biomass, roots recovered within 2 to 3 months to levels similar to no-till plots in a radius of 45 cm around the tree. Nematode infection rates were similar across treatments. Pseudo-stem volume of the banana trees did not differ significantly between tilled and no-till plots during the trial period. Hand <b>hoe</b> and <b>fork</b> affected at the same level the banana root system in the top 10 cm. We conclude that tillage strongly, but temporarily, damages the banana root system in the top 10 cm, which represents 24 - 50 % of the total root biomass between 0 and 20 cm depth. The decrease in root length and biomass in the topsoil may have adverse effects on the banana productivity, but longer term monitoring is required to quantify these effects on yield. The root pruning action of plowing may facilitate the early growth of the beans by temporarily reducing competition between bean roots and banana roots in the topsoil...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{assesses the}} impact of animal traction on rural household food security. Since rural communities do not have sufficient agricultural capital to purchase improved agricultural technologies for better crop production, and often lack knowledge and skills to apply improved technologies low-cost alternatives must be sought. For these reasons, animal traction has been seen by researchers as an affordable, easy-to-use, sustainable and appropriate operation for crops production in rural areas. Animal traction has been long used {{and it continues to}} be used in rural areas to improve food insecurities. But the system confronts a number of constraints that impede the development of its full potential and these should be addressed in order to reap the full benefits of agricultural restructuring in the rural areas. A study was carried out in Damane rural village under Ntsika Yethu Municipality in the Eastern Cape where animal traction is very popular. A total of 80 small-scale farmers were interviewed by means of structured questionnaires to collect data from adopters and non-adopters of animal traction. A wide range of analytical techniques were employed to assess {{the impact of}} animal traction on household food production. Descriptive statistics was employed for analyses of demographic, agricultural production process of the surveyed households and challenges encountered by households. Multiple Linear Regression was applied to determine the factors affecting animal traction use and the extent to which they contribute to gross farm production. The results of the multiple linear regressions showed that animal traction played a significant role in the total output of all the crops produced last season. The results of the t- tests showed that animal traction was the most effective technology compared to the simple hand-tools such as fork, <b>fork</b> spade and <b>hoes.</b> The binary logistic regression was employed to test the probability that resource poor households would adopt animal traction technology. It is therefore recommended that government should support animal traction users by providing all the necessary resources for development of animal in rural South Africa...|$|R
