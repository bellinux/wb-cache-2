5|$|During 1935, {{he began}} {{work for the}} National Resources Planning Board, which was then working on a large {{consumer}} budget survey.

This work resulted in their jointly authored publication Incomes <b>from</b> <b>Independent</b> Professional Practice, which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income, a major component of the Permanent Income Hypothesis that Friedman worked out in greater detail in the 1950s. The book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices.|$|E
5|$|From {{its release}} in 1998, Half-Life saw fervent support <b>from</b> <b>independent</b> game developers, due {{in no small}} part to support and {{encouragement}} from Valve Software. Worldcraft, the level-design tool used during the game's development, was included with the game software. Printed materials accompanying the game indicated Worldcraft's eventual release as a retail product, but these plans never materialized. Valve also released a software development kit, enabling developers to modify the game and create mods. Both tools were significantly updated with the release of the version 1.1.0.0 patch. Many supporting tools (including texture editors, model editors, and rival level editors like the multiple engine editor QuArK) were either created or updated to work with Half-Life.|$|E

5|$|Indeed, the endosymbiotic {{theory for}} {{the origin of}} organelles sees a form of {{horizontal}} gene transfer as a critical step {{in the evolution of}} eukaryotes such as fungi, plants, and animals. The endosymbiotic theory holds that organelles within the cells of eukorytes such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, had descended <b>from</b> <b>independent</b> bacteria that came to live symbiotically within other cells. It had been suggested in the late 19th century when similarities between mitochondria and bacteria were noted, but largely dismissed until it was revived and championed by Lynn Margulis in the 1960s and 1970s; Margulis was able to make use of new evidence that such organelles had their own DNA that was inherited independently from that in the cell's nucleus.|$|E
