50|$|A {{jackshaft}} is {{an intermediate}} shaft used to transfer power from a powered shaft {{such as the}} output shaft of an engine or motor to <b>driven</b> <b>shafts</b> such as the drive axles of a locomotive. As applied railroad locomotives in the 19th and 20th centuries, jackshafts were typically {{in line with the}} drive axles of locomotives and connected to them by side rods. In general, each drive axle on a locomotive is free to move about one inch (2.5 cm) vertically relative to the frame, with the locomotive weight carried on springs. This means that if the engine, motor or transmission is rigidly attached to the locomotive frame, it cannot be rigidly connected to the axle. This problem can be solved by mounting the jackshaft on unsprung bearings and using side-rods or (in some early examples) chain drives.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{locomotives}} {{have been}} built with horizontal cylinders driving a crankshaft directly above the rear driving axle, with a common spring supporting both the shaft and axle {{so that they could}} move vertically together. Ross Winans designed a series of 0-8-0 locomotives starting in 1842, launching what became the B&O Mud Digger class of engines. Like the Grasshopper locomotives before them, the crank shafts on these engines were geared to the <b>driven</b> <b>shafts.</b> [...] In his 1843 patent, Winas referred to the crankshaft as a fifth shaft, or axle. [...] In 1880, the Fowler Steam Plough Works of Leeds England received a patent on a similar 0-4-0 locomotive design with vertical side rods between the crankshaft and rear axle. Here, the motivation was to get the cylinders and piston rods up away from dust and dirt on an engine with diminutive drive wheels. [...] One such Fowler locomotive survives, an very small narrow-gauge 0-4-2T.|$|E
5000|$|Set screws are {{not always}} {{the best way to}} resist the torque of <b>driven</b> <b>shafts.</b> To reduce the chance of {{slipping}} and to increase load capacity, a detent (often called a [...] "flat") may be milled or ground at the part of the shaft where the set screw's point contacts. The detent, however, must be closely aligned with the threaded hole prior to fastening. The operator can often feel the screw push the flat into final alignment as he or she makes the last half- or quarter-turn that tightens the screw. Set screws can successfully hold against heavy-torque applications if the details are right. For example, endmill holders of the solid type typically use large set screws holding against flats to fasten the endmill, and heavy loads are resisted. However, small set screws without flats are prone to spinning and galling if overloaded. The use of keys and keyways instead of, or in combination with, set screws is common for applications requiring high torque resistance or transmission. Splines offer yet more strength.|$|E

40|$|After a {{discussion}} on basic kinematics and mechanics of Rzeppa type ball joints, the paper focuses on some design solutions provided by the patent literature. In particular a short patent review is carried out. Under ideal conditions the joint is homokinetic. However, geometry errors are inevitably present and nonhomokineticity induces torsional vibrations along the powertrain. For design purposes, the modeling of these effects at kinematics level is first required. In this paper an analytical procedure for kinematic analysis of ball joints with straight crossed tracks is proposed. The relationship between the rotations of the driving and <b>driven</b> <b>shafts</b> has been expressed as a fourth degree polynomial. This allows an accurate closed form solution, also {{in the case of}} the presence of geometry errors. By means of this procedure, that could be extended to other joint morphologies, the influence of manufacturing errors on the kinematics can be accurately investigated. The sensitivity coefficients of the transmission ratio with respect to the different ball joint geometry parameters can be also readily obtained. A numerical example shows the results obtained by applying the proposed method to a common type of industrial ball joint with geometric errors...|$|E
40|$|A {{rotating}} gear pair experiences high vibration and noise mainly due to tooth profile error, mounting error, tooth wear, friction backlash and periodic change of meshing stiffness. The combined {{effect of the}} manufacturing error, mounting error and elastic tooth deformation is considered as the static transmission error that introduces internal displacement excitation within the gear pair. Such internal excitation generates torsional vibration through the driving and <b>driven</b> <b>shafts</b> even in absence of external excitations. Thus the vibration problem of a geared system involves homogeneous equations of motion with time dependent boundary conditions. The present research is to investigate the torsional vibrations of a geared system by developing a continuous model that converts the homogeneous equations with non-homogeneous boundary conditions into non-homogeneous equations with homogeneous boundary conditions. The influence of friction, tooth wear, backlash and other nonlinear variables have been ignored in the formulation. The free vibration results of the proposed model are validated by developing the classical Rayleigh-Ritz model with Bhat's boundary characteristic orthogonal polynomial functions. The results are also validated by performing experiments in the laboratory for a simple geared system. Torsional vibration responses are determined in both time and frequency domains. In addition to the proposed continuous model the discrete model is simulated to determine torsional vibrations and dynamic torque generated due to static tooth error. The experimental investigations are carried out by measuring free torsional vibrations with strain gauge and frequency analysis by a spectrum analyze...|$|E

The High-Intensity-Preconditioner (HIP) was designed with two independently <b>driven</b> <b>shafts,</b> thus offering control of both shaft speed and rotational direction with potential for improving residence time and thus pathogen inactivation. Residence time distribution (RTD) of raw dog food mix was impacted by the HIP process parameters (average residence time varying between 104 - 178 s for dry experiment and 65 - 177 s with steam addition) depending on shaft speed and direction. In general, increase in shaft speed resulted in shorter residence time with the larger shaft having a greater impact than the smaller shaft. Rotational direction of shafts also {{had an effect on}} average residence time (a maximum difference of 37 s was noticed between treatments with different shaft directions and the same speed). The uniformity of residence time distribution (difference of 97 - 132 s between 15 and 85 percentiles of the cumulative RTD) also varied considerably with process conditions, with uniformity increasing with shaft speed.   	Enterococcus faecium (ATCC®  8459 ™) was chosen as a surrogate for Salmonella for microbial inactivation studies on the HIP. Both HIP shaft speed (200 and 300 rpm) and process temperature (67 - 70 °C and 89 - 91 °C) impacted E. faecium survival. Lower shaft speed (corresponding to longer residence time) or higher temperature led to greater E. faecium inactivation. A 5 log CFU/g of E. faecium was reduced using selective agar (m-Enterococcus or mE agar) after treatment with high temperature, but approximately 3. 5 log CFU/g of E. faecium reduced on non-selective agar (Brain Heart Infusion or BHI agar).
