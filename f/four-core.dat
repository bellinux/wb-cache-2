It was raised 1.5 inches for additional ground clearance, 2.5 inch wall-thick square tubing was used to prevent potential roof buckling and added a reinforcing railing {{that doubles as a}} skid plate, an auxiliary braking system designed to assist drivers in controlled spins, the master cylinder was repositioned in the brake line to enable it to feed the rear wheels enabling the driver to lock the aft end on command, and the auxiliary master cylinder utilizes the original master cylinder's reservoir and is installed in series with the outlet of the original master cylinder port leading to the rear wheels. When the stock brake is applied, fluid passes freely through the stunt master cylinder inlet port and compensating port and out the exhaust port to the rear wheels. When the stunt brake is applied, the piston in the master cylinder blocks off the compensating port to the exhaust port and pressurizes the rear brake system, cutting off the original brake master cylinder besides the compensating port in the stunt brake. BF Goodrich TA's were added for enhanced stick, as were Tilton brake calipers. The improved traction required installation of a hydraulic in-line brake power booster lifted from a Volvo P-1800. It operates on engine vacuum to aid in breaking loose the pavement-hugging TA's. To further enhance the growl of the vehicle, Robert's team installed a NOS port-injected nitrous system, which was later replaced with a plate-type configuration. He also replaced the carburetor replacing the stock with a Predator which reduces fuel lag. A Modine all-aluminum <b>four-core</b> radiator was used to guard against Miami's hot weather, and liquid Auto-Meter gauges to monitor the temperature.|$|E

Epub 2014 Feb 14. International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{quantify}} the incremental detection rate (DR) of a targeted biopsy {{in addition to}} a randomized 10 -core biopsy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study analysed 1024 patients who consecutively underwent a <b>four-core</b> real-time elastography (RTE) targeted biopsies {{in addition to a}} randomized 10 -core transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) -guided biopsy in a primary or rebiopsy setting. The overall DR, the DR of a 10 -core randomized, RTE targeted biopsy and the incremental DR were calculated. RESULTS: Overall, randomized and RTE targeted biopsy DRs (for the combination, the 10 -core and the <b>four-core</b> RTE biopsy scheme) were 46. 2 % (n = 473), 39. 1 % (n = 400) and 29. 0 % (n = 297), respectively. <b>Four-core</b> RTE targeted biopsies detected an additional 73 patients not detected by the 10 -core randomized biopsies (increase in the overall DR of 7. 1 %). This represented a relative increase in DR of 18. 3 %. The incremental DR was better in rebiopsy patients (24. 8 %) than in patients having their first biopsy (14. 7 %). Within all patients diagnosed by RTE targeted biopsy only, 34 patients harboured significant Gleason 4 or 5 prostate cancer (PCa), diagnosed by <b>four-core</b> RTE biopsy only. Moreover, PCa with a Gleason grade of 4 or 5 was detected by <b>four-core</b> RTE biopsies in 30 patients, who showed low-grade PCa </= Gleason 3 only in the systematic 10 -core biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time elastography targeted biopsy seems to be an appropriate method for increasing the DR of PCa. Nevertheless, RTE targeted biopsies missed a high proportion of patients with PCa and should therefore be considered as an addition to randomized biopsies...|$|E

A fringe pattern, which was generated by the interference of four wavefronts emitted from the <b>four-core</b> optical fiber, was projected on an object's surface.

This procedure allows for the recording of the quantum dot emission from carrier diffusion between sample positions separated by more than 6 μm. In the multiple-matched mode, the excitation spot overlaps the <b>four-core</b> emission area.

Most of the essential OS kernel functions are implemented in hardware. In particular, the preemptive multi-threading performance is much higher than that of a software-based VM running on a traditional OS kernel such as Linux. Currently, single-cycle context switching with a time quantum as small as 20  μs can be achieved by each core. More importantly, the Java language model itself makes it possible to maintain binary portability of application software regardless of the hardwired OS kernel component.

To realize a miniature and multi-functional system for biomedical applications, the design of on-sensor mircoprocessor {{is considered to be a}} solution. However, how to balance the power consumption and system scalability remains a challenge. In this work, we try to involve the concept of multi-core computing systems into biomedical applications. A fully programmable system architecture based on the proposed two-way pipeline processing unit (two-way PPU) is introduced and evaluated. The proposed two-way PPU is a computing unit that adopts the general purpose processor (GPP) to provide high system programmability, and is easy to be cascaded for system extension.

40|$|Abstract—Explicit finite {{difference}} {{method is}} widely used in finance for pricing many kinds of options. Its regular computational pattern makes it an ideal candidate for acceleration using reconfigurable hardware. However, because the corresponding hardware designs must be optimised both for the specific option and for the target platform, it is challenging and time consuming to develop designs efficiently and productively. This paper presents a unifying framework for describing and automatically implementing financial explicit finite difference procedures in reconfigurable hardware, allowing parallelised and pipelined implementations to be created from high-level mathematical expressions. The proposed framework is demonstrated using three option pricing problems. Our results show that an implementation from our framework targeting a Virtex- 6 device at 310 MHz is more than 24 times faster than a software implementation fully optimised by the Intel compiler on a <b>four-core</b> Xeron CPU at 2. 66 GHz.

30|$|In {{the study}} of toy {{functions}} and antenna design, the maximal number of objective function evaluations (MFE) is fixed at 5000 D. For each test case, an algorithm is independently run 25 times to reach an average performance of the algorithm. For parallel GA-TPC, computational resources are equally split to stages 1 and 2. That is MFE = 2500 D for stage 1 and MFE = 2500 D for stage 2. It {{can be seen from}} the parallel framework that communication between multiple cores happens when creating initial population at stage 2. Because computational resource is equally split and the same algorithm structure is used, it is expected that multiple cores would finish running nearly the same time so that wasteful waiting of the synchronization of multiple cores is reduced to minimum. Thus, good parallel efficiency could be reached in the proposed parallel framework. Both algorithms and problems are programmed in Matlab. The simulation is performed on a personal computer with <b>four-core</b> 3.40 GHz CPU and 4 GB random access memory.|$|E
40|$|Intelligently {{partitioning}} the last-level cache {{within a}} chip multiprocessor can bring significant performance improvements. Resources {{are given to}} the applications that can benefit most from them, restricting each core {{to a number of}} logical cache ways. However, although overall performanceisincreased,existingschemesfailtoconsiderenergy saving when making their partitioning decisions. This paper presents Cooperative Partitioning, a runtime partitioning scheme that reduces both dynamic and static energy while maintaining high performance. It works by enforcing cached data to be way-aligned, so that a way is owned by a single core at any time. Cores cooperate with each other to migrate ways between themselves after partitioning decisions have been made. Upon access to the cache, a core needs only to consult the ways that it owns to find its data, saving dynamic energy. Unused ways can be power-gated forstaticenergy saving. We evaluate our approach on two-core and <b>four-core</b> systems,showingthatweobtainaveragedynamicandstatic energy savings of 35 % and 25 % compared to a fixed partitioning scheme.

This paper presents our architecture, which provides local and remote scratchpad access, to either individual words or multiword blocks through RDMA copy. Furthermore, we introduce event responses, as a mechanism for software configurable synchronization primitives. We present three event response mechanisms that expose NI functionality to software, for multiword transfer initiation, memory barriers for explicitly-selected accesses of arbitrary size, and multi-party synchronization queues. We implemented these mechanisms in a <b>four-core</b> FPGA prototype, and evaluated the on-chip communication performance on the prototype {{as well as on}} a CMP simulator with up to 128 cores.
