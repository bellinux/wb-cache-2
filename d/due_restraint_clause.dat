40|$|This article {{assesses the}} impact of legal {{practice}} upon the enforceability of employment restraints of trade. Post-employment restraints range from those prohibiting use of confidential information acquired through employment (non-disclosure clauses), or the solicitation of previous customers (non-solicitation clauses), to wider clauses imposing an obligation on the employee not {{to compete with the}} employer for a defined period after the termination of the employment (non-compete clauses). The empirical research reported in this article demonstrates that there is much uncertainty in the operation of the law around the use of <b>restraint</b> of trade <b>clauses</b> in employment contracts. While most usefully nuanced, the evidence suggests that to a significant extent, this uncertainty weighs more heavily on the side of any dispute that is least able to bear it – the employee. In light of our findings, we have introduced a limited number of reform options (ranging from the radical to the limited, and from the substantive to the procedural) that would assist in reducing the over-enforcement, or over-observance, of <b>restraint</b> <b>clauses...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article {{is to examine the}} {{relationship}} between a so-called "garden leave" clause and a post-termination <b>restraint</b> of trade <b>clause</b> in employment contracts, in view of the decision in Vodacom (Pty) Ltd v Motsa 2016 3 SA 116 (LC). The Labour Court grappled with the question of whether the enforcement of the garden leave provision impacts on the enforcement of a post-termination <b>restraint</b> of trade <b>clause.</b> Enforcement of both these types of clauses may be problematic. It can result in unfairness if an employee ends up being commercially inactive for a long period. The author argues that garden leave has a direct effect on the enforcement of a post- termination <b>restraint</b> of trade <b>clause.</b> Accordingly, a <b>restraint</b> of trade will be enforced only if the employer's proprietary interest requires additional protection beyond what is achieved under the garden leave clause...|$|R

Landzeal, then provided a new copy of the contract with the pay schedule, which Kyne then signed. However, this version of the contract also had added a <b>restraint</b> of trade <b>clause.</b>|$|R

If anything further were needed to indicate the probability of this, there was a well-favored and very smartly-dressed man standing beside the wagon, and Jordan's face grew suddenly hard {{as he looked at}} him.
