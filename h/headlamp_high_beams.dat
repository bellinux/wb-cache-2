40|$|Summary Visibility {{distances}} to obstacles {{on the right}} hand side of a straight two-lane road have been obtained. In <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> with opposing <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> of about the same intensity there are {{no significant differences in}} the visibility distance as a function of <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> intensity over about 50000 cd. In <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> with opposing <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> of intensity about three times as large or more there is a large loss in visibility distance (> 35 %) compared with the situation above. The optimum distance for switching from <b>high</b> to low <b>beam</b> varied between 250 m and 400 m when the two opposing vehicles had about the same <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> intensity. In <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> without opposing glare there is very little gain in visibility in relation to the amount of increase of intensity above 50 000 cd. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of traffic fatalities involving pedestrians occur {{at night and}} this is largely attributed to low illumination conditions. Yet, drivers tend to underuse their <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> despite the visibility benefits afforded to them. In the present study we report <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> usage rates during an open-road drive using a video camera-based method. Measurements of low and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> <b>headlamp</b> illuminance were also taken for all vehicles used in this study. The results indicate that drivers, on average, used their <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> 48 % of the time possible. Furthermore, there was a moderately negative relationship between low <b>beam</b> output and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> use indicating that drivers whose low beams produced less illumination tended to use their <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> more often. Future research should empirically investigate this relationship to lend further insight into the mechanism by which beam output influences beam usage. Research that improves our understanding of drivers’ knowledge and use of <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> {{is likely to be}} important as headlighting technologies continue to advance...|$|R

50|$|Laser diodes were {{unveiled}} at {{the show}} {{that are going to}} be used for <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> headlights in Audi vehicles. The <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> will be lasers, though the low beams will be light-emitting diodes. The car maker says that their <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> have a 500-meter range, which is roughly twice the distance of LED <b>high</b> <b>beams.</b> Lasers are expensive though. Lasers are smaller, brighter and more energy efficient than LED headlamps. Their laser headlamps use less than half the energy of LEDs. Laser diodes can emit 170 lumens per watt, while LEDs generate only 100 lumens. Lasers are sensitive to heat but that has not stopped their production for vehicles. Laser technology is not as advanced compared with LEDs, which have been around for decades.|$|R
40|$|This {{analytical}} {{study examined}} the effects of mounting height on discomfort glare from reduced-power high-beam headlamps used as automotive daytime running lamps. Of interest were the effects for mounting heights between 0. 864 m (34 in) and 1. 372 m (54 in) - the range in which full-power low beams are currently allowed, but reduced-power <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> are not. Three analyses were performed. The first analysis involved estimating the illuminance reaching a preceding driver via rearview mirrors. The second analysis compared glare illuminance from reduced-power <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> with that from full-power low beams. The third analysis evaluated the expected changes in discomfort-glare ratings from reduced-power <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> as a function of increased mounting height. The analyses were based on photometric information from five <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> and 43 low beams from lamps manufactured for the United States market. They were performed for five following distances and three lateral offsets of the vehicles. The results indicate that allowing reduced-power <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> with mounting heights between 0. 864 m and 1. 372 m would not appreciably increase discomfort glare for preceding drivers as compared with (a) glare from reduced-power <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> at a mounting height of 0. 864 m, or with (b) glare from currently allowed full-power low beams...|$|R
25|$|Glare-free <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> is a camera-driven dynamic {{lighting}} control strategy that selectively shades spots and slices {{out of the}} <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> pattern to protect other road users from glare, while always providing the driver with maximum seeing range. The area surrounding other road users is constantly illuminated at <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> intensity, but without the glare that would result from using uncontrolled <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> in traffic. This constantly changing beam pattern requires complex sensors, microprocessors and actuators, because the vehicles which must be shadowed out of the beam are constantly moving. The dynamic shadowing can be achieved with movable shadow masks shifted within the light path inside the headlamp. Or, the effect {{can be achieved by}} selectively darkening addressable LED emitters or reflector elements, a technique known as 'Pixel light'.|$|R

50|$|In the United States, the {{legality}} of headlight flashing varies from state to state. Some states consider that drivers have a First Amendment right to flash their headlights. In other states, law enforcement officers give citations for headlight flashing under three types of laws: (1) laws prohibiting a person from obstructing a police investigation, (2) laws prohibiting a person from having flashing lights on their vehicle, and (3) laws prohibiting shining a vehicle’s <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> at oncoming traffic. The specific language of each law varies by state along with courts’ holdings on whether their respective laws prohibit headlight flashing. Additionally, although not legally binding, the state driver’s manual of some states suggests flashing <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> under specific scenarios (e.g. if an oncoming vehicle is using its <b>high</b> <b>beams,</b> driver’s manuals suggest a motorist flash his or her <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> momentarily).|$|R

25|$|Each {{system has}} its {{advantages}} and disadvantages. The American system historically permitted a greater overall {{amount of light}} within the low beam, since the entire reflector and lens area is used, {{but at the same}} time, the American system has traditionally offered much less control over upward light that causes glare, and for that reason has been largely rejected outside the US. In addition, the American system makes it difficult to create markedly different low and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> light distributions. The <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> is usually a rough copy of the low beam, shifted slightly upward and leftward. The European system traditionally produced low beams containing less overall light, because only 60% of the reflector's surface area is used to create the low beam. However, low beam focus and glare control are easier to achieve. In addition, the lower 40% of the reflector and lens are reserved for <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> formation, which facilitates the optimization of both low and <b>high</b> <b>beams.</b>|$|R
