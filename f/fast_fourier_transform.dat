5|$|One {{consequence}} of this fact appears in the bit-reversed ordering of integer data types used by some computer algorithms, such as the Cooley–Tukey <b>fast</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform.</b> This ordering has the property that the farther to the left the first 1 occurs in a number's binary expansion, or the more times it is divisible by 2, the sooner it appears. Zero's bit reversal is still zero; it can be divided by 2 any number of times, and its binary expansion does not contain any 1s, so it always comes first.|$|E
5|$|The first EC-137 {{made its}} maiden flight on 9 February 1972, with the fly-off {{between the two}} radars taking place during March–July that year. Favorable test results led to the {{selection}} of Westinghouse's radar for the production aircraft. Hughes's radar was initially {{thought to be a}} certain winner, simply because much of its design was also going into the new F-15 Eagle's radar program. The Westinghouse radar used a pipelined <b>fast</b> <b>fourier</b> <b>transform</b> (FFT) to digitally resolve 128 Doppler frequencies, while Hughes's radars used analog filters based on the design for the F-15 fighter. Westinghouse's engineering team won this competition by using a programmable 18-bit computer whose software could be modified before each mission. This computer was the AN/AYK-8 design from the B-57G program, and designated AYK-8-EP1 for its much expanded memory. This radar also multiplexed a beyond-the-horizon (BTH) pulse mode that could complement the pulse-Doppler radar mode. This proved to be beneficial especially when the BTH mode is used to detect ships at sea when the radar beam is directed below the horizon.|$|E

50|$|A key {{advantage}} of OFDM is that <b>fast</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> (FFTs) {{may be used}} to simplify implementation. <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> convert signals {{back and forth between the}} time domain and frequency domain. Consequently, <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> can exploit the fact that any complex waveform may be decomposed into a series of simple sinusoids. In signal processing applications, discrete <b>Fourier</b> <b>transforms</b> (DFTs) are used to operate on real-time signal samples.

25|$|This crude {{approach}} {{results in}} the often-poor performance of voice removal. Common effects are hearing the reverberation effects on the voice track (due to stereo reverb on the vocals not being in the center); also, other instruments (snare/bass drum, bass guitar and solo instruments) that happen to be mixed into the center get removed, degrading this approach to hardly more than a gimmick in those devices. Recent years have seen {{the development of new}} techniques based on the <b>Fast</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>Transform.</b> Although still not perfect, the results are usually much better than the old technique, because the stereo left-right comparison can be done on individual frequencies.|$|E
25|$|If the ordered pairs {{representing}} the original input function are equally spaced in their input variable (for example, equal time steps), then the Fourier transform {{is known as}} a discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which can be computed either by explicit numerical integration, by explicit evaluation of the DFT definition, or by <b>fast</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> (FFT) methods. In contrast to explicit integration of input data, use of the DFT and FFT methods produces Fourier transforms described by ordered pairs of step size equal to the reciprocal of the original sampling interval. For example, if the input data is sampled for 10 seconds, the output of DFT and FFT methods will have a 0.1Hz frequency spacing.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} and continual improvement of computers, at first mechanical analog machines and then digital electronic machines, allowed industry {{to deal with}} larger and larger amounts of data to facilitate mass production and distribution and communication, and new areas of mathematics were developed to deal with this: Alan Turing's computability theory; complexity theory; Derrick Henry Lehmer's use of ENIAC to further number theory and the Lucas-Lehmer test; Rózsa Péter's recursive function theory; Claude Shannon's information theory; signal processing; data analysis; optimization and other areas of operations research. In the preceding centuries much mathematical focus was on calculus and continuous functions, but the rise of computing and communication networks led to an increasing importance of discrete concepts {{and the expansion of}} combinatorics including graph theory. The speed and data processing abilities of computers also enabled the handling of mathematical problems that were too time-consuming to deal with by pencil and paper calculations, leading to areas such as numerical analysis and symbolic computation.
