50|$|Jess Jackson grew {{up during}} the Great Depression and was raised in San Francisco's Sunset District. His father, a teacher, {{was out of work}} three times while he was growing up, and there were times when the family had to survive only on rice. To help support his family, Jackson started working at an early age. From the age of five, when he got his first job as a paper boy, he worked a variety of careers, {{including}} candy maker, a soda jerk, a temp at the post office, a <b>hops</b> <b>picker,</b> a longshoreman, a teamster, a lifeguard, an ambulance driver, among other things, all before graduating from the University of California Berkeley law school.|$|R
50|$|Horst {{revolutionized}} {{the processing of}} hops with the invention of his mechanical hop separator, patented 1909 in Elk Grove, California. It picked the hops while discarding the bine and leaves. It produced 25 bales of hops in one day, while an experienced worker picked just two bales in a week, allowing him to bypass the hassles of hiring seasonal labor. Horst continuously invented new hop-related machinery (1884-1924) holding at least 14 patents. In the first season that Horst used the new machine, he advertised and kept <b>hop</b> <b>pickers</b> on hand, in case anything went wrong. When the separator proved itself and the pickers were told {{that there would be}} no work, the workers went on strike and blocked access to the kilns, halting the harvest.|$|R
50|$|This {{violence}} soon {{spread to}} Washington Territory. On September 7, 1885, in Squak Valley (present-day Issaquah, Washington), {{a group of}} white and Native American laborers, fired into the tents of Chinese <b>hop</b> <b>pickers</b> and killed three of them. On September 11, 1885, another instance of anti-Chinese violence occurred in the Coal Creek mines of Newcastle, Washington Territory. There, one Chinese miner was kidnapped and the barracks of several dozen Chinese workers was set on fire. On September 19th, 1885 in the coal mining community of Black Diamond, Washington Territory, white miners drove the Chinese out and injured nine of them. These events spurred a flurry of organizing activity devoted to expelling the Chinese from other communities in the Washington Territory.|$|R
2500|$|Eight of {{the twelve}} {{members of the jury}} for the trial of the {{agricultural}} strike organizers were farmers. Testimony for the prosecution emphasized the fact that Ford and Suhr were [...] "agitators." [...] No witness indicated that they had seen Ford with a gun; rather the case was made that by mobilizing the <b>hop</b> <b>pickers</b> the IWW organizer had [...] "filled the magazines of wrath." [...] Suhr's so-called [...] "confession" [...] was not introduced into evidence, indicative that it had been obtained through the use of illegal force, but three deputies were put on the stand to testify that Suhr had told them he had taken a gun from an old man while fleeing the scene and fired twice. This accusation was denied by Suhr. No eyewitness evidence was produced to indicate that Suhr had actually fired the fatal shots.|$|R
50|$|Hawaiians and Chinese in {{the region}} made much use of it as well. In some places Kanakas married into the First Nations and {{non-native}} families and their particular mode of the Jargon {{is believed to have}} contained Hawaiian words, or Hawaiian styles of pronunciation. Similarly the Jargon as spoken by a Chinese person or a Norwegian or a Scot will have been influenced by those individuals' native-speaker terms and accents. In some areas the adoption of further non-aboriginal words has been observed. The Chinook Jargon naturally became the first language in multi-racial households and in multi-ethnic work environments such as canneries and lumberyards and ranches where it remained the language of the workplace well {{into the middle of the}} 20th century. During the Gold Rush, Chinook Jargon was used in British Columbia by gold prospectors and Royal Engineers. As industry developed, Chinook Jargon was often used by cannery workers and <b>hop</b> <b>pickers</b> of diverse ethnic background. Loggers, fishermen and ranchers incorporated it in their jargon.|$|R
5000|$|A Brabiralung man, Tulaba, {{who later}} became an {{important}} informant {{for one of the}} founding fathers of Australian ethnography. He generally stayed clear of missions such as those at Lake Tyers and Ramahyuck missions, the reserves where many remnants of the Victorian tribes were herded into. He encountered A. W. Howitt near Bairnsdale around 1866 when the latter established a hops farm, and was engaged as overseer for the indigenous <b>hops</b> <b>pickers</b> employed there. In his two employers, the MacLeods and Howitt, Tulaba found people who either did not meddle in native ways, or positively encouraged their retention, and Howitt assumed a tribal kinship role in his relationship with Tulaba, overcoming the latter's reluctance to have him observe the initiation rites, and placing them in a (jerra-eil) relationship. [...] ) The information Tulaba provided in exchange for food and clothing, using a match-stick system Howitt deployed to delineate geneaological structures, played a seminal function in Howitt's thinking about the aboriginal kinship systems. Tulaba died due to cancer at the Lake Tyers Mission in 1886 and was buried according to Anglican rites.|$|R
5000|$|Robertsbridge {{became a}} {{junction}} in 1900 {{with the opening}} of the Rother Valley Light Railway to Tenterden. The line was extended to Headcorn in 1905, and was renamed the Kent and East Sussex Railway. In 1954 all regular passenger services were withdrawn and the line beyond Tenterden Town was completely closed. The line to Tenterden continued to be used by freight services and occasional special passenger trains (e.g. <b>hop</b> <b>pickers</b> trains) until closed by British Railways on 12 June 1961. About half a mile length of line remained in use as a siding to serve Hodsons Mill on the outskirts of Robertsbridge until 1970.The bay platform, on the Down (eastern) side of the station, is still in place and used for engineers trains. A railway preservation society, the Rother Valley Railway, is in progress in constructing a new separate station on the east side of the car park, and have rebuilt the line from here to Northbridge Street. The first train on this rebuilt section ran in September 2013. They have plans to rebuild the rest of the route eastwards to join up with the Kent and East Sussex Railway and restore services along the line. (Steam trains already run on another section of the line, between Tenterden Town and Bodiam, 3½ miles from Robertsbridge.) ...|$|R
2500|$|Before {{the days}} of {{mechanised}} farming, hop picking was a labour-intensive process, requiring a vastly greater number of people than were available locally. Whole families (including children {{who could have been}} at school) from London, particularly the south-east and east of London, would leave their homes and spend their time working in the Wealden hop-fields of Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Hampshire. By the 1870s, the South Eastern Railway and the London Chatham and Dover Railway were running Hop Pickers' Specials to transport Londoners to the towns and villages {{at the start of the}} season. Similar trains were run to serve the pickers in Herefordshire and Worcestershire. An estimated 250,000 <b>hop</b> <b>pickers</b> from London were travelling to Kent by the early twentieth century [...] In Hampshire, some workers came from the Portsmouth, Southampton and Salisbury areas. Hopper huts were also provided in Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Workers in these two counties would come from the Black Country or South Wales. The miners from South Wales remained at home and carried on working at their pits. Accommodation in the early Victorian period would be in barns, stables, cattle sheds, pigsties, tents or the roof space of buildings. This led to problems with hygiene and therefore health. An outbreak of cholera killed 43 hop-pickers at East Farleigh in September 1849.|$|R
2500|$|In 1898, Father Richard Wilson, {{a priest}} from Stepney, London, became {{curious as to}} what his parishioners did when they disappeared. He persuaded one family to take him with them. He too was appalled by the {{conditions}} the pickers had to live in, but would go with them each year, gradually gaining their trust. From 1897 he rented a cottage at Five Oak Green for 2s.6d a week, furnishing it with cots and providing a nurse. Thus, the Little Hoppers Hospital was born. It was very busy that year, as there was an outbreak of smallpox. A few years later, {{he was able to}} rent a larger cottage. By 1906 most of the districts of Kent had laws to similar effect, and many farms had hopper huts by 1914. In 1910, Father Wilson bought the Rose and Crown public house in Five Oak Green and turned the building into the Hoppers' Hospital. [...] The building bore the legend [...] "E and H Kelsey's Fine Ales, Stout and Porter Sold Here" [...] over three lines, to which Father Wilson simply added the word [...] "not" [...] before the last two words. [...] This Hoppers Hospital was in operation for over 60 years. The Salvation Army also used to visit the <b>hop</b> <b>pickers</b> in the fields and attend to their welfare. There was also a Hoppers Hospital at Marden, which was not connected with the one at Five Oak Green.|$|R
