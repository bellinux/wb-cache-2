Methods: We performed a qualitative study based on semi-structured in-depth interviews, conducted from July 2012 until August 2013, with 24 Dutch {{parents who had}} had children through donor sperm treatment between 2000 and 2012. Results: During counseling, parents sometimes <b>felt</b> <b>screened</b> for their eligibility for parenthood rather than guided, and therefore felt discouraged about bringing up topics that were important for them. Parents of all family types would value extended psychological counseling before and after successful donor sperm treatment, that is in several stages of parenthood. Only after childbirth topics such as disclosure, fear of rejection of the social parent and future contact of the child with the sperm donor became more pertinent...|$|R

40|$|Two {{hundred and}} fifty-nine {{men and women}} aged 20 - 45 years who {{did not respond to}} an offer from their general {{practitioner}} for a health check were interviewed at home to explore the reasons for non-response. There was no support for the view that the invitation aroused anxiety or that the administrative arrangements had been a barrier to acceptance. Many subjects were not really interested (44 %) or just forgot to attend (24 %). Crises at work or home (26 %) and current attendance at a doctor (16 %) were other reasons offered, while 11 % <b>felt</b> <b>screening</b> to be in appropriate. There is little {{that can be done to}} change these rates except by a shift of public opinion to more consumer demand for health checks or by more opportunistic health checks when people attend their doctors for other reasons. The dangers of marketing health checks to increase consumer demand are discussed in the light of these findings and other work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{combination}} element frequency {{selective surface}} (FSS) with regular triangle patches and circular aperture elements in activated carbon fiber (ACF) felts were designed. The {{effects of the}} structure parameters and periodic arrangement of regular triangle patches on ACF felt composites were investigated. As the regular triangle patches were embedded into circular apertures, the combination element ACF <b>felt</b> <b>screen</b> (ACFFS) composites presented fluctuant absorbing characteristics and showed double-band frequency response characteristic including band pass and band stop. When the regular triangle edge length (L) increased, the effective absorption frequency (the reflection loss below- 10 dB) shifted to low frequency, and the effective bandwidth increased without reducing the maximum absorption value. When the regular triangle patches (L = 30 mm) were in staggered rows, the effective absorption frequency drifted by 3. 1 GHz, and the effective bandwidth was enhanced from 4. 3 GHz to 11. 0 GHz. Although the regular triangle patches are not central symmetry, it is proved that the absorption properties can be improved obviously by both horizontal polarization and vertical polarization...|$|R

40|$|My {{concept for}} the SES Decorated shed project was felt. Through researching the {{ideology}} and precedent buildings the clear concepts of felt was the interconnection and intertwining of space, {{but also by}} being able to visually connecting the spaces. So using this theory I decided to explore this concept through the spaces which connect rooms and area; hence “felt by circulation”. This can be seen mainly through the ramp and stair systems which link the floors together. These allow occupants to change floors but also connect into different spaces while using them visually felting them into the main spaces. For the exterior screen the idea of felt was also explored. Through using the previous screen project a similar component was found and manipulated to create 3 layers of the exterior screen. These layers where then weaved together linking and creating one <b>felted</b> <b>screen.</b> When exploring the site vernacular in Marrickville and searching for pattern the most interesting feature was the wear and tear of materials. Materials seemed take the natural cause of action of. Corroding, decaying recreating the original material to suite its environment. This idea was used for the screen material being Corten; the material will be forever changing linking into the context of Marrickville. The screens play a curial role within the interior. The internal layout has been designed to celebrate the screen allowing the users see and understand the work of the SES, that being weaving and protecting the community in time of need. At night the building will glow allowing the surrounding neighbour to feel protected. BDES 2020 (Architecture Studio 202...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{describe}} {{the perspectives of}} general dentists regarding oral health care for children ≤ 3 years. Methods. Mailed survey of 444 general dentists in Michigan. Results. Although most dentists were aware of recommendations for early dental visits, only 36 % recommended their own patients begin dental visits by 1 year of age. Only 37 % dentists <b>felt</b> that <b>screening</b> for oral health problems {{can be done by}} medical providers, whereas 34 % agreed administration of fluoride varnish by medical providers would be effective in preventing dental problems in young children. Conclusions. Dentists’ failure to recommend 1 -year dental visits is due neither to lack of awareness nor to capacity problems. The limited enthusiasm for involving children’s medical providers in oral health promotion signals attitudinal barriers that must be overcome to improve children’s oral health. Primary care providers should identify and refer to dentists in their community who are willing to see young children...|$|R

This study aimed to determine the attitudes of young women {{to the introduction of}} chlamydia screening in Australian General Practice. Methods In-depth face-to-face interviews with 24 young women from across Victoria, Australia, attending a randomly selected sample of general practices. Results Young women reported that they would accept age-based screening for chlamydia in general practice, during both sexual-health and non-sexual-health related consultations. Trust in their general practitioner (GP) was reported to be {{a major factor in the}} acceptability of chlamydia <b>screening.</b> The women <b>felt</b> chlamydia <b>screening</b> should be offered to all young women rather than targeted at "high risk" women based on sexual history and they particularly emphasised the importance of normalising chlamydia screening. The women reported that they did not want to be asked to provide a sexual history as part of being asked to have a chlamydia test. Some reported that they would lie if asked how many partners they had had Conclusion Women do not want a sexual history taken when being asked to have a chlamydia test while attending a general practitioner. They prefer the offer of chlamydia screening to be based on age rather than assessment of sexual risk. Chlamydia screening needs to be normalised and destigmatised. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} general practitioners' {{knowledge of}} and attitudes to impaired glucose tolerance. Design: Mixed methodology qualitative and quantitative study with semistructured interviews, focus groups, and questionnaires. Setting: 34 general practitioners in five primary care groups in the north east of England. Results: All the general practitioners had knowledge of impaired glucose tolerance as a clinical entity, but they had little awareness of the clinical significance of impaired glucose tolerance and were uncertain about managing and following up these patients. Attitudes to screening were mixed and were associated with reservations about increased workload, concern about lack of resources, and pessimism {{about the effectiveness of}} lifestyle interventions. Some general practitioners <b>felt</b> strongly that <b>screening</b> patients for impaired glucose tolerance and subsequent lifestyle intervention medicalised an essentially social problem and that a health educational approach, involving schools and the media, should be adopted instead. A minority expressed a positive attitude towards a pharmacological approach. Conclusion: Awareness of impaired glucose tolerance needs to be raised, and guidelines for management are needed. General practitioners remain to be convinced that they have a role in attempting to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes by targeting interventions at patients with impaired glucose tolerance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Information on {{clinical}} acceptability is needed when making cost-utility decisions about health screening implementation. Despite being in use for two decades, most {{data on the}} clinical acceptability of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) come from qualitative reports, or include relatively small samples of depressed women. This study aimed to measure acceptability {{in a survey of}} a relatively large, community sample with a high representation of clinically depressed women. Methods Using mail, telephone and face-to-face interview, 920 postnatal women were approached {{to take part in a}} survey on the acceptability of the EPDS, including 601 women who had screened positive for depression and 245 who had received DSM-IV diagnoses of depression. Acceptability was measured on a 5 -point Likert scale of comfort ranging from "Not Comfortable", through "Comfortable" to "Very Comfortable". Results The response rate was just over half for postal surveys (52 %) and was 100 % for telephone and face-to-face surveys (432, 21 and 26 respondents for postal, telephone and face-to-face surveys respectively) making 479 respondents in total. Of these, 81. 2 % indicated that screening with the EPDS had been in the range of "Comfortable" to "Very Comfortable". The other 18. 8 % rated screening below the "Comfortable" point, including a small fraction (4. 3 %) who rated answering questions on the EPDS as "Not Comfortable" at the extreme end of the scale. Comfort was inversely related to EPDS score, but the absolute size of this effect was small. Almost all respondents (97 %) <b>felt</b> that <b>screening</b> was desirable. Conclusion The EPDS had good acceptability in this study for depressed and non-depressed women. Women's views on the desirability of postnatal depression screening appear to be largely independent of personal level of comfort with screening. These results should be useful to policy-makers and are broadly supportive of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale as a suitable tool for universal perinatal depression screening. </p...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to begin to assess the {{awareness}} and knowledge of sickle-cell amongst carriers and non-carriers in a screened population of primarily African-Caribbean descent. A structured questionnaire containing 10 multiple-choice knowledge questions on sickle-cell was administered by community interviewers of African-Caribbean descent who did not know the respondents' haemoglobinopathy status. The survey took place in Leicester between the advent of selective screening at ante-natal clinics for sickle-cell in 1989 and the appointment of a haemoglobinopathy counsellor in 1993. One hundred and four people whose blood had been tested recently for sickle-cell (50 consecutive carriers and 54 non-carriers tested after the start date of the project) were identified as subjects for interview. Responses were obtained from 24 carriers (two of whom, it transpired, had sickle-cell anaemia) and 31 noncarriers. No significant differences in levels of sickle-cell awareness were found between carriers and non-carriers. Patterns of inheritance and the range of ethnic groups who carry the sickle-cell trait were least understood. Ethically there are grave problems in screening without systematic counselling, but little haemoglobinopathy counselling is undertaken by generic health professionals in the absence of haemoglobinopathy counsellors. There is considerable demand for leaflets and further counselling, though it is <b>felt</b> unlikely that <b>screening</b> in itself contributes much to raising levels of knowledge...|$|R

Methods: An online questionnaire available on the Dutch pregnancy fair website was completed by 381 pregnant women. Results: Of the women, 51 % expressed interest in having NIPT, including 33 % of women who had declined first-trimester screening. The majority (73 %) thought that the uptake of screening would increase with NIPT. Most women agreed that testing for life-threatening (89 %), severe physical (79 %), or severe mental (76 %) disorders should be offered. A minority (29 %) <b>felt</b> that prenatal <b>screening</b> should also be offered for late-onset disorders. Most (41 %) preferred to have a free choice from a list of disorders, 31 % preferred a 'closed offer', and 26 % preferred choosing between packages of disorders. Although most women (76 %) thought that screening for a broad range of conditions would avoid much suffering, 39 % feared that it would confront couples with choices, the implications of which would be difficult to grasp. Conclusion: The results suggest that the uptake of screening will increase with NIPT. If NIPT will be offered for a broad range of conditions, it is crucial to find a way that facilitates rather than undermines well-informed decision-making...|$|R

The views of general practitioners (GPs) {{are necessary to}} inform {{the design of the}} program. This paper aimed to investigate Australian GPs' views on how chlamydia screening could work in the Australian context. METHODS: This project used both qualitative interviews and a quantitative questionnaire. GPs were randomly selected from a national database of medical practitioners for both the qualitative and quantitative components. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with GPs and a thematic analysis conducted. The results of the interviews were used to design a quantitative postal questionnaire for completion by a larger sample of GPs. Up to three reminders were sent to nonresponders. RESULTS: Twenty one GPs completed an interview and 255 completed the postal questionnaire. The results of the postal survey were in strong concordance with those of the interview. GPs identified a number of barriers to increased screening including lack of time, knowledge of GPs and the public about chlamydia, patient embarrassment and support for partner notification. GPs <b>felt</b> strongly that <b>screening</b> would be easier if there was a national program and if the public and GPs had a greater knowledge about chlamydia. Incentive payments and mechanisms for recall and reminders would facilitate screening. Greater support for contact tracing would be important if screening is to increase.

A questionnaire assessing possible reasons for noncompliance was sent to subjects who {{did not attend the}} five year repeat screening. Results: 1672 primary screening flexible sigmoidoscopies were performed in 1997 &ndash; 1999 with 1362 being normal or having hyperplastic polyps only. The return rate was 45 %: 48 % of eligible males and 39 % of eligible females had returned (p = 0. 001 for difference). 709 questionnaires were mailed with a 50 % response rate and 162 requests for repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy were generated. 27 % of all respondents had undergone further bowel evaluation since the original normal sigmoidoscopy.

The survey {{was aimed at}} obtaining data on the current screening and treatment strategies for NLDO and the interval between lacrimal surgery and subsequent cataract surgery. Methods: An online survey was sent to all members of Oculoplastic Association of India. All valid responses were tabulated and analyzed. Results: Majority of the respondents (92 %) felt that nasolacrimal duct patency should be checked prior to performing cataract surgery: 59. 6 % felt that checking for regurgitation on pressure over the lacrimal sac (ROPLAS) was sufficient and 32. 6 % preferred to perform lacrimal irrigation to check for NLD patency. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) was the preferred surgery for NLDO thus detected. The preferred interval between a DCR and subsequent cataract surgery was 4  weeks (48. 9 %). A small minority (7. 9 %) of the respondents <b>felt</b> that pre-cataract <b>screening</b> for NLDO was not required. Also, a small but significant number (12. 6 %) felt that no treatment was required for NLDO in such patients and that to could go ahead with cataract surgery even {{in the presence of}} coexisting NLDO. Conclusions: There is a general agreement on the need for pre-cataract screening for NLDO and a majority indicated that checking for ROPLAS was sufficient. Most surgeons prefer to perform a DCR in cases of NLDO and wait for 4  weeks before intraocular surgery. There is however, a lacuna in the literature on guidelines regarding the optimal interval between lacrimal surgery and subsequent intraocular surgery...|$|R

Afterwards, he went freelance and eventually worked for companies/publishers like: TSR, Inc. (Dungeons & Dragons), Wizards of the Coast (Talislanta), Atlas Games, and Avalon Hill. Some of his notable works include the entirety of the card art for the trading card games, Dixie and Eagles (both published by Columbia Games Inc.), of which over 1,000 cards were illustrated within a period of a year and a half. More recently, he has been working more for himself, creating Whitewash City, a large set of PDF wild west cardstock buildings, which he researched and designed from historical sources, many from actual surviving Old West buildings. He also created Roman Seas, recreating authentic Roman warships and merchant ships in PDF file format for paper construction.

500|$|The World Ends with You was {{developed}} by the same team that created the Kingdom Hearts series, with input from Jupiter, the company that developed [...] The development of the game started {{two and a half years}} before its Japanese release, during the development of Kingdom Hearts II and the end of development of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories. At that time, Nintendo had announced the DS, but it was not yet on the market; Square Enix asked the team to make a game specifically for the handheld system. The creative team—consisting of Tatsuya Kando (director), Tomohiro Hasegawa (co-director), Takeshi Arakawa (planning director), and Tetsuya Nomura (character design)—were able to experience the DS during the [...] "Touch DS" [...] event in November 2004. From this demonstration, they had envisioned a version of Chain of Memories in which the card game aspects would be present on the bottom screen and an action role-playing game on the top. As they continued to work on the game, the developers realized that they wanted to use the touchscreen more, to make [...] "a game that can only be played on the DS". However, they also encountered the problem that by focusing heavily on the touchscreen, the top screen would be ignored. From this, the idea of the dual screen battle system arose. Several other options were explored for the top-screen game, including command-based battles or a music game, but once they reviewed the game from the eyes of the player, they ultimately settled on the card-game approach with the player having the option to control the game if they wanted to. Even with the completion of the Japanese version of the game, the team <b>felt</b> the dual <b>screen</b> system was too much for overseas audiences, and attempted to change the card-game mechanic into a special meter that would fill up with normal attacks from Neku, but this was not completed in time for release. However, the team was able to alter the [...] "information overload" [...] of the numerous tutorials at the start of the game in the North American release, reducing the amount of text presented as well as allowing the tutorials to be skipped. The [...] "Active Encounter" [...] system, the ability for the player to select when and how to go into battle, {{was developed}} specifically to avoid the issues of [...] "grinding" [...] that are common with most standard RPG systems. While they included the mechanics of being able to scan non-playable characters to see their thoughts, the team was not able to integrate this mechanic more into the game.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In 2015, a {{new policy}} {{mandates}} that institutions accredited with the Commission on Cancer (CoC) of the American College of Surgeons implement distress screening for all cancer patients. However, not all cancer patients experience distress, with some having higher levels of psychosocial distress than others. Implementation of a standard assessment could place a burden on the systems of care in cancer institutions. The {{purpose of this study}} is to understand the attitudes of healthcare professionals towards the new policy and to describe implications of implementing distress screening for all patients. Social workers working in accredited cancer institutions now have a professional duty to engage in distress screening, and to recognize the psychosocial and spiritual issues that impact cancer patients and their families. They must implement a plan to address these needs, and connect patients with appropriate services. More than ever, social workers are involved in addressing the gaps in services by identifying psychosocial problems and tackling social justice issues that impact cancer care, all of which challenge the traditional role of the oncology social worker. Methods: This paper utilizes survey research methodology from oncology social workers examine attitudes about cancer patients unmet needs, and whether a universal policy for psychosocial distress screening could negatively impact oncology social workers’ ability to provide care. We conducted a National Online Survey with social workers from the Association of Oncology Social Work to examine their attitudes and practice behaviors related to distress screening. The analysis included structured questions and free text. Results: With a 41. 5 % response rate (n= 465, N= 1125), participants reported that distress screening is useful and acts as a proactive measure to anticipate issues during treatment and assists to address patients’ concerns before a crisis happens. The majority said that screening for distress was either extremely (47. 3 %) or very much (42. 2 %) important to them. Distress screening was described as a quick way to get information, especially because of the limited time available. While some patients may not want to be seen by a social worker, many underreport their distress and distress screening allows those most in need to be heard. However, some oncology social workers <b>felt</b> that distress <b>screening</b> tools should not be implemented with every patient, especially if they resources to follow up on patients’ needs. Implications: It is important for social workers to be aware of the various psychosocial distress screening tools that are available. However, by screening every patient there is a danger that social workers become overwhelmed with all types of patient care needs, big and small. While standard screening tools can quickly identify patients’ needs, they can also identify patients in crisis, those most in need of a social worker. Oncology social workers can assist cancer patients and families as they begin treatment and embrace the changes that occur during treatment. Further attention is needed to develop clinical strategies that include distress screening, while improving the overall quality of cancer care...|$|R
