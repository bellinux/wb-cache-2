It appeared that an already existing crack had extended through more than 90% of the wall thickness and was about 800 mm in length. Further, {{it was determined that}} hydrogen embrittlement had reduced the fracture resistance of the steel by more than half. The vessel had been put into service in 1970 and had undergone several repairs and modifications before the July 1984 incident. The vessel was fractured along a path that was weakened by extensive cracking adjacent to a repair weld joining a replacement section to the original vessel.

The most prominent of the materials recommended are inconels and incolys which are Ni-Cr-Fe alloys. Though their nominal compositions were not presented, they are found to be very applicable in well head and flow lines with high sour and temperature applications. The materials (13 Cr, 316, 22 Cr, and 25 Cr) recommended by Craig [48] which are presented in Table  4 are also applicable to tackle corrosion in {{the oil and gas}} industry but are only active in the absence of oxygen, H 2 S, and elemental sulfur. The alloy (13 Cr) is corrosion resistant in CO 2 /NaCl environments in the absence of O 2 and H 2 S, while 25 Cr is corrosion resistant in H 2 S/CO 2 environments in the absence of elemental sulfur. The new alloy presented by Mannan et al. [47] with nominal composition Fe- 47 Ni- 20.5 Cr- 3 Mo- 2 Cu- 3 Nb- 1.5 Ti was developed by the method of homogenized vacuum induction melting. The mechanical properties and microstructure exhibited by the alloy after corrosion testing indicated that it could resist stress corrosion cracking, galvanically induced <b>hydrogen</b> <b>stress</b> <b>cracking,</b> and sulfide stress cracking [77].|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{embrittlement}} {{has caused}} many service failures in linepipe steel. Service conditions present several avenues by which hydrogen can adversely affect the mechanical properties of such steel. Fesseler [1] reported that local mechanical damage can arise from handling and laying of pipe {{and that some}} cathodic protection schemes can in fact inject dangerous amounts of hydrogen into a steel. There can be synergism between these two aspects which can give extremely high hydrogen charging conditions resulting in failure [2]. Metallurgists in {{the oil and gas}} industries refer to this type of failure as <b>hydrogen</b> <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> (HSC). Future synthetic natural gas from coal gasification may contain as much as 50 % H 2 which will be very deleterious to linepipe properties. Sulfides present in natural gas, hydrogen sulfide or carbon disulfide, tend to inhibit the recombination of 2 HADS → H 2 and therefore favor atomic hydrogen absorption into a steel [3]. Welding of linepipe is a potential source of nearly every known hydrogen problem depending on the circumstances of the technique [4]. Thus it is apparent that NDE techniques adaptable to field use will be important to the maintenance of thousands of miles of existing and future pipelines.

40|$|Concern {{has been}} {{expressed}} that hydrogen produced by corrosion, radiolysis, and decomposition {{of the waste}} could cause embrittlement of the carbon steel waste tanks at Hanford. The concern centers on the supposition that the hydrogen evolved {{in many of the}} existing tanks might penetrate the steel wall of the tank and cause embrittlement that might lead to catastrophic failure. This document reviews literature on the effects of hydrogen on the carbon steel proposed for use in the Multi-Function Waste Tank Facility for the time periods before and during construction {{as well as for the}} operational life of the tanks. The document draws several conclusions about these effects. Molecular hydrogen is not a concern because it is not capable of entering the steel tank wall. Nascent hydrogen produced by corrosion reactions will not embrittle the steel because the mild steel used in tank construction is not hard enough to be susceptible to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> and the corrosion product hydrogen is not produced at a rate sufficient to cause either loss in tensile ductility or blistering.

40|$|A {{review of}} the effect of {{hydrogen}} on materials is addressed in this paper. General aspects of the interaction of hydrogen and materials, hydrogen embrittlement, low temperature effects, material suitability for hydrogen service and materials testing are the main subjects considered {{in the first part of}} the paper.

The relative SCC initiation resistance decreased with increasing yield strength. In the cathodic potential region, the SCC initiation stress was smaller than the yield stress of steel; it was approximately equal to the stress at 0. 1 pct strain (sigma(0. 1 pct) for all the steels.

Carbon steel is resistant to the most common forms of corrosion, particularly from hydrocarbon impurities at temperatures below 205 °C, but other corrosive chemicals and environments prevent its use everywhere. Common replacement materials are low alloy steels containing chromium and molybdenum, with stainless steels containing more chromium dealing with more corrosive environments. More expensive materials commonly used are nickel, titanium, and copper alloys.

Specifically, the effect of hydrogen on crack initiation and propagation in Inconel 718 has been investigated by use of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Materials with two different grain sizes were examined in order to explore the effect of grain size on HE in Inconel 718. An {{attempt was made to}} develop a novel procedure for measuring local strains in tensile samples tested with in situ cathodic polarization. This procedure was based on using digital image correlation software to analyze series of images obtained with an optical microscope during tensile testing. Inconel 718 material of both grain sizes were found to be susceptible to HISC, based on fracture surfaces exhibiting transgranular cleavage fractures and severe secondary cracking on the sample surface. No secondary cracking was observed for samples tested in air. Qualitative examinations of specimen surfaces in SEM suggested that crack initiation happens preferentially at grain boundaries (GBs) and twins. This was supported by EBSD results indicating higher dislocation density at GBs and twins. Crack propagation happened transgranularly, as evidenced by the fracture surfaces. Hydrogen induced localized plasticity (HELP) is assumed to be the dominating mechanism for HISC, as suggested by significantly deformed regions near the crack edge and surrounding the crack tip.

Hydrogen related problems in the weld fabrication stage or <b>hydrogen</b> induced <b>stress</b> <b>cracking</b> (HISC) due to hydrogen embrittlement under cathodic protection have been reported and testing to better understand the behavior of these materials is of interest. The present work is focusing on the effect of double heat cycles on carbide precipitation and secondary hardening in two high grade SMSS, one alloyed with Ti and one not (0. 007 % Ti). The experimental work included heat treatment of both steels in single and double cycles in both oven and in induction heating weld simulator. All specimens were heated to 1000 degrees celsius for 30 min to austenize the material and air cooled before simulating second heat cycles of 1 - 60 min in the temperature range 500 - 600 degrees celsius. The microstructures resulting from the heat treatments were characterized by standard metallographic techniques, hardness testing and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results from hardness testing show a secondary hardening effect in both steels for all temperatures tested, with a maximum for samples treated at 550 degrees celsius. For all samples there was also a significant drop in hardness from the hardness of the single cycle sample to the 1 min tempered double cycle samples. From investigation in TEM it was found that, in the steel alloyed with titanium TiC precipitate during tempering and in the steel not alloyed with titanium Cr 23 C 6 precipitate during tempering at 550.

Testing has been done in a small test-jig incorporating a light microscope for crack and microstructural surveillance of the samples. Non-notched and notched samples have been tested. The non-notched samples tested showed to be too ductile for the test-jig, thus only the - 1050 mVAg/AgCl sample fractured with a fracture strength of 136 &# 177; 0 % of yield strength (YS).

This was done by hydrogen pre-charging and stepwise loading in Cortest proof rings, followed by {{an investigation of the}} fracture surfaces in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Five different versions of Inconel 625 were examined; one hot isostatic pressed (HIP), one cold worked and three forged qualities. The three forged qualities were subjected to heat treatment at 920 °C, 1010 °C and 1100 °C, respectively. An attempt was also made to estimate the critical hydrogen concentration necessary for brittle fracture to occur in Inconel 625. This was done by combining diffusion calculations with hydrogen measurements performed by SINTEF. The critical pitting temperature (CPT) for the different versions of Inconel 625 was obtained by {{a modified version of the}} ASTM G 48 test. The forged and the HIPed versions of Inconel 625 were found to be susceptible to HISC. This was based on a decrease in strength and ductility, as well as brittle fracture surfaces and secondary cracking on the samples outer surface. The CW samples showed a higher resistance to HISC, as no reduction in fracture strength, nor any secondary cracking was observed. Forged samples heat treated at 1010 °C were found to be the most susceptible to HISC, while heat treatment at 1100 °C resulted in the lowest HISC susceptibility amongst the forged qualities. The amount of grain boundary carbides was found to be the main factor influencing the HISC susceptibility, where an increased amount led to a higher susceptibility. The effect of grain size on the HISC susceptibility of Inconel 625 samples charged with hydrogen is still unresolved, but the results indicate that larger grains have a beneficial effect on the ductility.

The testing {{was carried out in}} cortest proof rings on three test specimens pre-charged with hydrogen and one reference specimen without hydrogen until fracture occurred. Hydrogen measurements were conducted and the fracture surfaces were examined in a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and the embrittlement through thickness was indexed. The possibility of secondary cracking was also investigated using the SEM. In addition, the microstructures were examined using optical microscopy (OM) and assessed compared to the HISC testing results. The austenite spacing was also measured. The hydrogen measurements together with the presence of secondary cracking of all test materials confirmed HISC being the fracture mechanism. The test results indicated that all SDSS materials tested are susceptible to HISC, and that the hot extruded material with no cold deformation has a higher HISC resistance while centrifugally cast materials are more prone to HISC than the other production methods. The fracture surfaces of all hydrogen charged test materials showed features indicating a reduction in ductility due to HISC as well as both ductile and brittle fracture characteristics across the surfaces. The placement of the ductile and brittle features varied, and both could be found close to the centre and edges of the fracture surfaces. The fracture surfaces for the reference specimens showed mostly ductile fracture characteristics. The results from the HISC testing were discussed compared to available literature on the subject of HISC in SDSS, and the susceptibility of the materials from the different materials towards HISC were ranked from lowest to highest based on the overall test performance and measurements conducted.

The fractured chain was examined in terms of its microstructure, hardness, transition temperature and strength. An attempt was made to explain why the fractured chain failed in-service. The tensile test of the fractured chain revealed that its yield strength was 140 MPa lower than that of the sandblasted chain. It was considered possible that the fracture chain were weaker than they should have been and that the reason it failed in-service was due to overload. The susceptibility of the two chains to HISC was tested by submerging tensile specimens into a 3. 5 % NaCl solution in CorTest Proof rings, while exposed to hydrogen. Specimens were either hot dip galvanized (HDG), protected by an external potential of - 1050 mV vs. Ag/AgCl or freely exposed at their corrosion potential.

The tubing, {{as a key}} {{ingredient}} in the well development, worked always under very complex stress and corrosion conditions, {{the failure of the}} tubing could cause huge losses. In this paper, a fractured 3 - 1 / 2 ″ P 110 SS tubing was analyzed through physical and chemical properties testing, SEM, EDS, and XRD method. The results showed that the failure of the tubing was belong to <b>hydrogen</b> sulfide <b>stress</b> corrosion <b>cracking.</b> The tubing material could not pass the SSC test, it was inappropriate to use in well contained high hydrogen sulfide. Background During the killing well operation at YuanBa NO. 29 well in northeastern SiChuan basin, the tubing pressure dropped sharply from 29. 4 MPa to 0 MPa, and the tubing was found fractured when removed from the well. The depth of finding fracture was 684. 22 m. The longitudinal cracking was found on the tubing, as shown in Fig. 1. a) upper fracture b) lower fracture Fig. 1 Pictures of the fractured tubing The fractured tubing was Φ 88. 9 × 9. 52 mm P 110 SS tubing, which was used 2 years. The well was gas well depth 6899 m, the temperature at bottom of well was 152. 56 ˚C, and the content of H 2 S was 5. 98 %wt. The failure analysis was done to the upper fractured tubing to investigate the reason of the tubing failure...|$|R

The {{main source of}} hydrogen formed during the reactions of titanium alloys with hot salt was identified as water associated with the salt. Hydrogen is produced by the reaction of an intermediate (hydrogen halide) with the alloy rather than from metal-water reactions. The fracture mode of precracked tensile specimens was ductile when the specimens were tested in air, and brittle when tests were made in high-pressure <b>hydrogen.</b> <b>Stressed</b> titanium-aluminum alloys also were cracked by bombardment with hydrogen ions produced in a proton accelerator. The approximate concentrations of the hydrogen ions in the alloys were calculated...|$|R
