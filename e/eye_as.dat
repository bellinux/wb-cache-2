The Sun is also a star, but it is close enough to the Earth to appear as a disk instead, and to provide daylight. Other than the Sun, the star with the largest apparent size is R Doradus, with an angular diameter of only 0.057 arcseconds.|$|E

5|$|Humberto {{continued}} to intensify {{on the morning}} of the 23rd as the central dense overcast became well defined, despite the lack of a clear eye feature. However, the intensification was slowed somewhat by the proximity of Iris to the west, whose outflow interfered with that of Humberto. Early on August 24, Humberto strengthened into a Category2 hurricane, finally forming a well-defined <b>eye,</b> <b>as</b> it slowed down and entered a Fujiwhara interaction with Iris. That afternoon, while still moving west-northwest, Humberto reached its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), just under Category3 intensity.|$|E
5|$|In the marginalia that El Greco {{inscribed in}} his copy of Daniele Barbaro's {{translation}} of Vitruvius' , he refuted Vitruvius' attachment to archaeological remains, canonical proportions, perspective and mathematics. He also saw Vitruvius' manner of distorting proportions {{in order to}} compensate for distance from the <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> responsible for creating monstrous forms. El Greco was averse to {{the very idea of}} rules in architecture; he believed above all in the freedom of invention and defended novelty, variety, and complexity. These ideas were, however, far too extreme for the architectural circles of his era and had no immediate resonance.|$|E
5|$|Plants have {{elaborate}} and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One {{of the most}} effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen molecules.|$|E

5|$|The {{nervous system}} is large {{relative}} to the bird's size. The most developed {{part of the brain}} is the one that controls the flight-related functions, while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building. Most birds have a poor sense of smell with notable exceptions including kiwis, New World vultures and tubenoses. The avian visual system is usually highly developed. Water birds have special flexible lenses, allowing accommodation for vision in air and water. Some species also have dual fovea. Birds are tetrachromatic, possessing ultraviolet (UV) sensitive cone cells in the <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> well as green, red and blue ones.|$|E
5|$|Two National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Research planes {{conducted}} experiments into Caroline. The {{experiments were}} {{to study and}} measure the wind velocity and the environment inside and around the <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> well as the boundary layer of the hurricane. The results of the experiments concluded that Caroline had a higher dissipation rate than normal hurricanes, with the dissipating rate averaging at 30%. This conclusion suggested that energy in a hurricane dissipating internally above the surface layer is two times higher than energy dissipating at the surface.|$|E

Whatever its merit, {{it is evident that}} during the 17th century, the Baroque style {{in the hands of the}} local architects and sculptors was already deviating from that of mainland Italy. This localised variation on the mainstream Baroque was not peculiar to Sicily, but occurred as far afield as Bavaria, and Russia, where Naryshkin Baroque would be just as eccentric as its Sicilian cousin.|$|E

5|$|After playing League cricket for Blackpool in 1939, on the {{outbreak}} of war Larwood left the game altogether, to work away from the public <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> a market gardener. In 1946 he used his savings to buy a sweet shop in Blackpool. Although he generally kept away from organised cricket and avoided all personal publicity, he was persuaded to attend a farewell luncheon for Don Bradman {{at the end of}} the Australians' 1948 tour. He and Bradman exchanged polite courtesies, though he was warmly welcomed by other members of the Australian team, including their premier fast bowler Ray Lindwall. The following year Larwood became one of 26 former professional Test cricketers awarded honorary membership of the MCC. This recognition, he said, went some way to help heal the hurt he had felt over his treatment by the game's ruling body 15 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|After {{slightly}} weakening {{throughout the}} day on August6, Felicia leveled out with winds of 135mph (215km/h) and a 23mi (37km) wide <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> the storm developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, which would allow Felicia to maintain a high intensity over marginally warm waters. Early the next day, {{the structure of the}} hurricane quickly deteriorated as convection became asymmetric and cloud tops warmed significantly. This marked a quick drop in intensity of the storm to a minimal Category 3 hurricane. Several hours later, the mid-level circulation began to separate from the low-level circulation and the overall size of the storm decreased. By this time, the storm began to take a long-anticipated westward turn towards Hawaii. After briefly re-intensifying on August7, Felicia weakened to a Category 1 hurricane early on August8. Around 11:00am HST (2100UTC), the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) took over responsibility of issuing advisories as Felicia crossed longitude 140°W.|$|E

5|$|Before {{tools such}} as the {{telescope}} were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked <b>eye.</b> <b>As</b> civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas {{on the nature of}} the Universe began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|Coinciding with Chan-hom's abrupt {{collapse}} on July3, {{the system}} turned northeast as it entered a {{weakness in the}} steering ridge. Later that day, the broad circulation turned north-northwest. Wind shear eased early on July4 as the TUTT cell retreated {{to the north and}} the subtropical ridge steadily re-established itself. Convection started redeveloping over the tropical storm. Late on July4 into July5, the center of Chan-hom skirted the southern coast of Rota in the Mariana Islands. While near the island, Chan-hom executed an unusual counter-clockwise loop owing to interaction with a monsoon trough. Once clear of the Mariana Islands, steady development ensued owing to low wind shear and good outflow. Early on July7, Chan-hom attained typhoon intensity according to the JMA, following to a burst in central convection. Microwave satellite imagery indicated the formation of an <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> convection deepened and banding features tightened around the circulation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the myth}} called the Destruction of Mankind, related in the Book of the Heavenly Cow from the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC), Ra uses the <b>Eye</b> <b>as</b> a weapon against humans who have rebelled against his authority. He sends the Eye—Hathor, in her {{aggressive}} manifestation as the lioness goddess Sekhmet—to massacre them. She does so, {{but after the}} first day of her rampage, Ra decides to prevent her from killing all humanity. He orders that beer be dyed red and poured out over the land. The Eye goddess drinks the beer, mistaking it for blood, and in her inebriated state returns to Ra without noticing her intended victims. Through her drunkenness she has been returned to a harmless form. Nadine Guilhou suggests that the Eye's rampage alludes to the heat and widespread disease of the Egyptian summer, and in particular to the epagomenal days before the new year, which were regarded as unlucky. The red beer might then refer to the red silt that accompanied the subsequent Nile flood, which was believed to end the period of misfortune.|$|E

Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced {{with a set of}} three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through red, green and blue filters and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by the human <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.|$|E
5|$|On August5, 1964, a weak trough {{emerged from}} Florida over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. According to the Atlantic {{hurricane}} database (referred to as HURDAT), the system {{developed into a}} tropical depression by 18:00UTC (1:00p.m. CDT) that day, with its center located roughly 160mi (260km) south-southeast of the Mississippi River Delta. Moving generally west, the system exhibited no signs of further development as it neared the Texas coastline. However, on August7, radar images from Brownsville, Galveston, Lake Charles, and Victoria showed an abrupt increase in organization. During the afternoon hours, banding features consolidated around a developing eye and weather reconnaissance planes were dispatched to the system. Forecasters initially mistook the <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> a hook echo-type feature {{at the end of}} a squall line. It is estimated that the depression became a tropical storm by 12:00UTC (7:00a.m. CDT), roughly 60mi (95km) southeast of Galveston, Texas. Operationally, the system was not even monitored as a depression this time, with the classification and naming of Tropical Storm Abby occurring at 16:00UTC (11:00a.m. CDT) on August7.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{becoming}} a hurricane, Felix developed a well-defined <b>eye</b> <b>as</b> Hurricane Hunters began investigating the storm. Beginning at 1200UTC on August11, the hurricane began undergoing rapid deepening, {{and by the}} next day, concentric eyewalls were observed, indicative of a strong storm. On August12, the Hurricane Hunters observed flight-level winds of , suggesting peak surface winds of 140mph (220km/h). At that time, Felix was located north of the Lesser Antilles, moving to the north-northwest due to an approaching trough weakening the ridge. After peak winds, Felix weakened due to stronger wind shear and its eyewall replacement cycle. The eye became indistinct and opened on August13, {{and it became a}} minimal hurricane by August14 with a broad inner core. Late on August14, Hurricane Felix turned more to the west-northwest, after the trough that previously brought it northward split into two pieces of energy, one moving southward and the other moving northeastward. On August15, the hurricane passed about 75mi (120km) south of Bermuda, and a building ridge was anticipated to allow Felix to continue its trajectory toward North Carolina.|$|E
