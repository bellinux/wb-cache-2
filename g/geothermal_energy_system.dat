50|$|As {{described}} by Brown, an HDR <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>system</b> is developed, first, by using conventional drilling to access {{a region of}} deep, hot basement rock. Once it has been determined that the selected region contains no open faults or joints (by far the most common situation), an isolated section of this first borehole is pressurized at a level high enough to open several sets of previously sealed joints in the rock mass. By continuous pumping (hydraulic stimulation), a very large region of stimulated rock is created (the HDR reservoir) that consists of an interconnected array of joint flow paths within the rock mass. The opening of these flow paths causes movement along the pressure-activated joints, generating seismic signals (microearthquakes). Analysis of these signals yields information about the location and dimensions of the reservoir being developed.|$|E

5000|$|Energy Conservation: Energy {{conservation}} {{is definitely the}} most intensive {{when it comes to}} cost premiums for implementation. However, it also has the largest potential for savings. Minimum savings can be achieved at no additional cost by pursuing passive design strategies. The next step up from passive design in the level of green (and ultimately the level of savings) would be implementing advanced building envelopematerials, like structural insulated panels (SIPs). SIPs can be installed for approximately $2 per linear foot of exterior wall. That equals a total premium of less than $500 for a typical one-story home, which will bring an energy savings of 50%. According to the DOE, the average annual energy expense for a single family home is $2,200. So SIPs can save up to $1,100 per year. To reach the savings associated with a net-zero energy home, renewable energy would have to be implemented {{on top of the other}} features. A <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>system</b> could achieve this goal with a cost premium of approximately $7 per square foot, while a photovoltaic system (solar) would require up to a $25,000 total premium.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{key element}} in the characterization, {{assessment}} and development of <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> is the resource type. Throughout the past 30 years many resource type schemes and definitions were published, based on temperature and thermodynamic properties. An alternative possibility to cataloging <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> is by their geologic characteristics, referred to as geothermal plays. Applied to worldwide case studies, a new catalog is developed based {{on the effects of}} geological controls and structural plate tectonic positions on thermal regime and heat flow, hydrogeologic regime, fluid dynamics, fluid chemistry, faults and fractures, stress regime, and lithological sequence. Understanding geologic controls, especially of geothermal plays without surface expression, allows the comparison with hydrocarbon reservoirs through their ratio of porosity and permeability. This analog has implications on site-specific, first class exploration strategies and reservoir improvement through technologies specifically suitable for unconventional sustainable energy reservoirs. This article aims to introduce geothermal plays to a wide geoscientific community and to initiate a geologically based cataloging of geothermal resources. With this new catalog of geothermal plays, it will be ultimately possible to transfer lessons learned not only within one specific catalog type, but also technology from geothermal plays to unconventional hydrocarbon plays and vice versa...|$|R

40|$|The {{advancement}} {{of renewable energy}} technologies is critical due to the unsustainable nature of currently used energy sources {{and the need to}} meet increasing energy demands. A broad and diverse energy plan is important for long term energy independence and stability. Geothermal energy sources including hydrothermal systems and enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) should {{play a key role in}} this energy plan. Geothermal energy is the most reliable, currently developed, schedulable alternative energy source. It is estimated that improvements in these systems have the potential to provide at least 200, 000 exajoules of energy to the U. S. in as little as 50 years [1]. The progress in developing this field is challenging in part due to the complex geochemical and geophysical properties of the subsurface environment. This dissertation reviews <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>system</b> limitations due to current well monitoring technologies and introduces microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors as a means of optimizing well performance. Harsh environment MEMS offer an ideal alternative to macro-scale sensors due to their harsh environment material compatibility, the ability to couple MEMS with wireless RF transmission systems, and their small footprint. In this work, harsh environment MEMS encapsulation materials are tested in simulated geothermal environments to determine their survivability. The sensors must be encapsulated to provide protection from oxidation, erosion, surface roughening, and other chemical attacks. Encapsulation materials such as silicon carbide, sapphire, vitreous carbon, and poly-crystalline diamond were tested in multiple simulated geothermal environments to determine a suitable protective layer for these MEMS devices. Once appropriate materials are determined, two temperature sensors are designed, optimized, fabricated, and tested. The first sensor improves upon existing out-of-plane MEMS capacitive temperature sensor devices by utilizing harsh environment materials. The second sensor is a novel in-plane design optimized to linearize capacitive output. These sensors are tested up to over 650 °C. [1] Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

30|$|Due {{to the low}} thermal {{diffusivity}} of aquifers relative to air, subsurface temperatures experience less fluctuation than surface air temperatures. Therefore, <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> use aquifers as heat sources {{during the winter months}} and as heat sinks during the summer months. In principle, {{there are two types of}} <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> systems: the ground source heat pump (GSHP) and the groundwater heat pump (GWHP). The GSHP is a closed system with a heat-carrying fluid circulating through a tube system installed underground. Heat is exchanged between the aquifer and the GSHP system, but the groundwater level remains unchanged. The GWHP is an open system, within which groundwater is extracted and sent through the heat pump installed at the ground surface. Heat is released or extracted depending on the season, and groundwater is re-injected within a short time period back into the aquifer (Haehnlein et al. 2010). Even though the cones of depression from groundwater withdrawal wells are likely to affect local-scale groundwater flow, the water budget does not change on a regional scale. However, the issue of changing the subsurface temperature around an injection well is crucial in some respects. Increasing the number of <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> within a small area can affect the efficiency of the individual systems (Ferguson and Woodbury 2006). Moreover, effects of temperature changes on the groundwater ecosystems such as estuaries, wetlands and ponds can be critical (Brielmann et al. 2009; Bonte et al. 2011).|$|R

30|$|GEOPHIRES is a {{computer}} code to perform techno-economic simulations of <b>geothermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>systems.</b> For a given set of input parameters, the tool simulates the subsurface reservoir, wellbore, and surface plant either by using built-in or external user-provided models.
