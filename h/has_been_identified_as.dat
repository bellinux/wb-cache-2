5|$|Although the {{mortuary}} inscription of Pacificus, archdeacon of Verona, {{records that}} he constructed a night clock (horologium nocturnum) {{as early as}} 850, his clock <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> being an observation tube used to locate stars with an accompanying book of astronomical observations, rather than a mechanical or water clock, an interpretation supported by illustrations from medieval manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Coins {{and seals}} {{from the site}} were studied. A {{particular}} circular seal cast in bronze with two headed eagle at the top <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> belonging to tsar John Alexander (r. 1331–1371).

The peak population in the early 16th century may have been around 10,000 people.|$|E

5|$|Against Neaera is {{preserved}} as Demosthenes' fifty-ninth speech, {{though it has}} been thought inauthentic since antiquity. Dionysius of Hallicarnassus, for instance, questioned its authorship. Modern scholars from the nineteenth century to the present have generally accepted that the speech was not written by Demosthenes, and today it is often grouped {{with the rest of}} the speeches concerning Apollodoros as being the work of a single Pseudo-Demosthenes. This author <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> Apollodoros himself by various scholars, including Kapparis in his commentary on the speech.|$|E
5|$|As of September 2017, {{reconstruction}} of the damaged lower section of the spillway was about one-third complete, {{with the goal of}} making the spillway operational by November 1. In 2018, the upper section of the spillway which was undamaged by the flood but also <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> structurally defective, will be demolished and rebuilt. In addition, crews are working to extend a cutoff wall under the emergency spillway to prevent erosion should that structure be used again in the future.|$|E

50|$|In general, Romani and Traveller {{sites are}} rural and {{segregated}} from areas {{that would normally}} be considered residential areas; {{it is common for}} these sites to be environmentally disadvantaged by being located near motorways, railroads, and garbage dumps, quarries, waterways, electrical transmission lines, or surrounded by industrial zones, all of which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> environmental health concerns. Seventy percent of local authority (LA) Irish Traveller sites in England <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> <b>having</b> at least two or more environmental hazards, while twenty-three percent of such sites <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> being subject to four or more environmental hazards.|$|R
5|$|Ealdred had {{returned}} to England by 1055, and brought with him {{a copy of the}} Pontificale Romano-Germanicum, a set of liturgies, with him. An extant copy of this work, currently manuscript Cotton Vitellus E xii, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> a copy owned by Ealdred. It appears likely that the Rule of Chrodegang, a continental set of ordinances for the communal life of secular canons, was introduced into England by Ealdred sometime before 1059. Probably he brought it back from Germany, possibly in concert with Harold.|$|E
5|$|Having {{rejected}} paganism as a {{young man}} due to its perceived moral corruption, he travelled in Greece, Asia Minor, Palestine and Egypt. Clement's journeys were primarily a religious undertaking. In Greece, he encountered an Ionian theologian, who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> Athenagoras of Athens; while in the east, he was taught by an Assyrian, sometimes identified with Tatian, and a Jew, who was possibly Theophilus of Caesarea.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the largely alignment-oriented statistically led methods of Green archaeoastronomy, Brown archaeoastronomy <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> being closer {{to the history of}} astronomy or to cultural history, insofar as it draws on historical and ethnographic records to enrich its understanding of early astronomies and their relations to calendars and ritual. The many records of native customs and beliefs made by the Spanish chroniclers means that Brown archaeoastronomy is most often associated with studies of astronomy in the Americas.|$|E

5|$|Motul de San José <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> {{the source}} of Ik-style polychrome {{ceramics}} bearing painted scenes of the Late Classic Maya aristocracy involved {{in a variety of}} courtly activities. The Ik-style was characterised by hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour, scenes with dancers wearing masks, and the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life. The city was the capital of a polity that included various satellite sites of varying importance, including a port on the shore of Lake Petén Itzá.|$|E
5|$|Other {{metabolites}} {{isolated from}} different species include dibenzonaphtyridinone alkaloids, prenylated phenols, benzofurans, chromenes, natural rubber (polyisoprene), sterols, and the sugar alcohol volemitol. Among toxic substances, Lactarius turpis contains the mutagenic alkaloid necatorin, {{and the small}} compound cycloprop-2-ene carboxylic acid <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> the toxic agent in Russula subnigricans. Some secondary metabolites showed antibiotic properties in laboratory tests. An ethanolic extract of Russula delica was antibacterial, and a lectin from Russula rosea showed antitumor activity.|$|E
5|$|The Nigerian {{health care}} system is {{continuously}} faced with a shortage of doctors known as 'brain drain', because of emigration by skilled Nigerian doctors to North America and Europe. In 1995, it was estimated that 21,000 Nigerian doctors were practising in the United States alone, which is about the same as the number of doctors working in the Nigerian public service. Retaining these expensively trained professionals <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the goals of}} the government.|$|E
