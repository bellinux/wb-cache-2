50|$|The Rodman gun is any of {{a series}} of American Civil War-era columbiads {{designed}} by Union artilleryman Thomas Jackson Rodman (1815-1871). The guns were designed to fire both shot and shell. These heavy guns were intended to be mounted in seacoast fortifications. They were built in 8-inch, 10-inch, 13-inch, 15-inch, and 20-inch bore. Other than size, the guns were all nearly identical in design, with a curving bottle shape, large flat cascabels with ratchets or sockets for the <b>elevating</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Rodman guns were true guns that did not have a howitzer-like powder chamber, as did many earlier columbiads. Rodman guns differed from all previous artillery because they were hollow cast, a new technology that Rodman developed that resulted in cast iron guns that were much stronger than their predecessors.|$|E

In 2013, a study confirmed Auger recombination as the cause of efficiency droop.|$|R
2500|$|Arsenic {{is highly}} {{detrimental}} to the innate and the adaptive immune system of the body. [...] When the amount of unfolded and misfolded proteins in endoplasmic reticulum stress is excessive, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated to increase the activity of several receptors that are responsible the restoration of homeostasis. The inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1) and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) are two receptors that restrict the rate of translation. On the other hand, the unfolded proteins are corrected by the production of chaperones, which are induced by the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). If the number of erroneous proteins <b>elevates,</b> further <b>mechanism</b> is active which triggers apoptosis. Arsenic has evidentially shown to increase the activity of these protein sensors.|$|R
5000|$|Because driver's hatch {{was moved}} from the glacis plate and {{positioned}} so that he exited the vehicle perpendicularly instead of crawling out of the hatch, his seat received an <b>elevating</b> <b>mechanism.</b> While in a relatively safe area the driver could elevate his seat to look outside of the tank, providing greater visibility and easier access to the controls. While in combat the driver lowered his seat back into the tank and {{had to rely on}} the vision slot protected by [...] (three-layer glass). While in this position the pedals of the main clutch, the fuel supply, and incline brake were positioned much higher and the levers of the steering clutch and gear shifting became inconvenient to operate. Early examples had transmission problems. While the driver was switching gears, two gears could engage simultaneously, which caused a broken gear pinion. This and other gearbox related problems were solved in a 1961 T-44M modernization with the introduction of a gearbox from the T-54 main battle tank.|$|E
5000|$|After July 1943, the appliqué armor bosses on {{the hull}} {{side of the}} M10A1 were deleted as the armor kits were never manufactured. This meant that some M36s had the {{redundant}} bosses, while others did not. The M36 initially retained the M10A1's [...] "stirrup" [...] gun rest on the rear hull; crews were unhappy {{about the lack of}} a proper travel lock for the 90 mm gun, and many improvised their own from travel locks taken from tanks. As the massive muzzle blast of the 90 mm gun obscured the crew's vision and reduced the rate of fire, a double-baffle muzzle brake was fitted to all vehicles after the first 600, beginning in early November 1944. A proper folding travel lock better-suited to the 90 mm gun was added to the rear hull at about this time. The gun itself was also modified with a better equilibrator and more powerful <b>elevating</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After {{the lessons}} learned at the Battle of Austerlitz, where Russian {{artillery}} had performed poorly, Arakcheyev devised the [...] "System of 1805". Under this arrangement, 6- and 12-pounder guns were employed throughout the army, as well as 2-, 10-, and 18-pounder licornes. Under the new system, a single Russian division had as much artillery as an entire French corps. A foot artillery battalion was composed of two light and two heavy companies. A light foot artillery company consisted of four 10-pounder licornes, four light and four medium 6-pounder guns; a heavy artillery company had four light and four heavy 12-pounder guns and four 18- and two 2-pounder licornes. Six light 6-pounder guns and six 10-pounder licornes made a company of horse artillery. Licornes were usually deployed on the flanks of the batteries. All these guns used a screw <b>elevating</b> <b>mechanism</b> instead of the old system of wedges and had an improved sighting apparatus.|$|E

The <b>elevated</b> wear-rate <b>mechanism</b> of CCC brakes at low operating temperatures (< 100 °C) is well understood (Abbott, 1995). Oxidation of these friction materials increases between temperatures of 400 °C - 600 °C (Cullinan et al, 1989), which also increases the level of heat-pack wear. The current method for monitoring the life of CCC brakes is by visual inspection of the wear pin indicator.

30|$|Appalachian USA {{coal mines}} have been implicated as major {{stressors}} to aquatic life in headwater streams via discharge of {{total dissolved solids}} (TDS). This paper summarizes column leaching studies of spoils (n >  50) and refuse and TDS effects on local water quality and biotic response. The initial pH of most materials is near-neutral. Initial specific conductance (SC) values range from 500 – 1, 000 to > 3, 000  µs/cm, but 2 / 3 of materials drop below 500  µs/cm after several pore volumes of leaching. Studies of mining-influenced streams have found altered aquatic life, relative to natural conditions with no mining influence, at SC ranging from ~ 200 to ~ 700  µs/cm with depressed aquatic life consistently associated with <b>elevated</b> TDS; <b>mechanisms</b> causing such effects are under investigation. We suggest that active mine operations should be modified to place high TDS producing materials in ways that reduce contact with percolating drainage waters.|$|R
40|$|Yra 1 p is an {{essential}} RNA-binding protein that couples transcription to export. The YRA 1 gene {{is one of only}} ∼ 5 % of genes that undergo splicing in budding yeast, and its intron is unusual in several respects, including its large size and anomalous branchpoint sequence. We showed previously that the intron is required for autogenous regulation of Yra 1 p levels, which cause a dominant negative growth phenotype when <b>elevated.</b> The <b>mechanism</b> of this regulation, however, remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that growth is inversely correlated with splicing efficiency. Substitution of a canonical branchpoint moderately improves splicing but compromises autoregulation. Shortening the intron from 766 to ∼ 350 nt significantly improves splicing but abolishes autoregulation. Notably, proper regulation can be restored by insertion of unrelated sequences into the shortened intron. In that the current paradigm for regulated splicing involves the binding of protein factors to specific elements in the pre-mRNA, the regulation of YRA 1 expression appears to occur by a novel mechanism. We propose that appropriate levels of Yra 1 p are maintained by inefficient cotranscriptional splicing...|$|R

40|$|Calcitonin is a {{circulating}} polypeptide that inhibits bone resorption by inducing both quiescence (Q effect) and retraction (R effect) in osteoclasts. Two structurally related {{members of}} the calcitonin gene peptide family, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and amylin, inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption selectively via the Q effect. In the present study, we have made measurements of cell spread area {{in response to the}} application of amylin, CGRP and a peptide fragment of CGRP, CGRP-(Val 8 Phe 37). We found that, over a wide concentration range (50 pmol/l to 2. 5 mumol/l), the selective Q effect agonists did not produce an R effect. Furthermore, the peptides, when used at a 50 -fold higher molar concentration than calcitonin, did not antagonize calcitonin-induced cell retraction. Additionally, experiments designed to measure changes in the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) in single osteoclasts revealed that, unlike calcitonin, the non-calcitonin Q effect agonists did not produce a rise in [Ca 2 +]i. The peptides were also unable to attenuate the peak rise in [Ca 2 +]i induced by calcitonin. The results support our hypothesis that the inhibitory activity of calcitonin on osteoclastic bone resorption is mediated by two sites {{which may or may not}} be part of the same receptor complex. One of these is the classical Q effect site coupled to adenylate cyclase via a cholera toxin-sensitive Gs. This site can be activated by nanomolar concentrations of calcitonin, amylin, CGRP or CGRP-(Val 8 Phe 37).

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 The sum {{of costs}} and {{benefits}} in an interspecific interaction determines whether the relationship is mutualistic, neutral, or antagonistic. We investigate novel benefits Acacia constricta may gain from ant visitors and how A. constricta may minimize potential costs of ant visitation. A. constricta attracts ants onto its foliage and encourages nesting at its base with extrafloral nectaries. Plants with basal nests have significantly greater soil nutrients and produce twice as many seeds as plants lacking basal nests (Wagner 1997). Along side these benefits, however, ants can interfere with plant reproduction. This study tests whether augmented soil nutrients increase A. constricta's defenses and ant attractants. We further test mechanisms A. constricta may have to reduce the potential costs of ants to reproduction. We found that increased soil nutrients <b>elevated</b> defense <b>mechanisms</b> in A. constricta and increased extrafloral nectary number, suggesting ants that provide plants with nutrients may indirectly increase plant defense as well as participate in a feed back cycle where ants increase soil nutrients allowing plants to increase ant attractants.

40|$|Abstract-Multi-resistant {{strains of}} Blattella germanica are now common, and {{strategies}} for their continued control using conventional insecticides need to be devised rationally if long-term suppression of these nuisance insects is to be achieved. Newer insecticides such as growth regulators may {{have a role in}} such strategies, but these cannot be used wholly as substitutes for conventional insecticides, due to their high cost and mode of action, which may result in a residual nymphal population being present over a long period. This may, wrongly, be perceived as control failure by householders. In order to devise control strategies for multi-resistant B. germmica the resistance status of thirty strains from four countries was determined for a range of pyrethroids.
