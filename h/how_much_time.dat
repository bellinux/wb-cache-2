5|$|The 21stages of the 2009 Giro d'Italia {{were divided}} into five categories: one team time trial, seven flat stages, four {{intermediate}} stages, seven mountain stages and two individual time trials. The type of stage together with the average speed of the winner decided <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> each cyclist {{would be allowed to}} finish that stage before being eliminated from the race.|$|E
5|$|Hans Bethe {{once said}} that Klaus Fuchs was the only {{physicist}} he knew who truly changed history. Because {{the head of the}} Soviet project, Lavrenti Beria, used foreign intelligence as a third-party check, rather than giving it directly to the scientists, as he did not trust the information by default, it is unknown whether Fuchs's fission information had a substantial effect. Considering that the pace of the Soviet program was set primarily by the amount of uranium they could procure, it is hard for scholars to accurately judge <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> this saved.|$|E
5|$|The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), {{the agency}} {{responsible}} for tracking down and reporting all communicable diseases in the U.S., faced governmental apathy {{in the face of}} mounting crisis. Shilts reported how CDC epidemiologists forged ahead blindly after being denied funding for researching the disease repeatedly. Shilts expressed particular frustration describing instances of the CDC fighting with itself over <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> and attention was being paid to AIDS issues.|$|E

50|$|Several factors {{determine}} <b>how</b> <b>much</b> delivery <b>time</b> {{stock and}} safety stock should be held. In summary, {{the efficiency of}} a replenishment system affects <b>how</b> <b>much</b> delivery <b>time</b> is needed. Since the delivery time stock is the expected inventory usage between ordering and receiving inventory, efficient replenishment of inventory would {{reduce the need for}} delivery time stock. And the determination of level of safety stock involves a basic trade-off between the risk of stockout, resulting in possible customer dissatisfaction and lost sales, and the increased costs associated with carrying additional inventory.|$|R
25|$|It {{concerns}} {{an engineer}} of explosives who, through remorse over bowing to his co-workers' blithe dismissal of technical glitches and thereby {{contributing to a}} thinly-fictionalized Challenger Incident, places explosives on the plane carrying himself and the culpable co-workers, thus killing them and committing suicide. The title is a reference to {{how long it would}} take the plane to fall to the ocean far below and to <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time's</b> worth of oxygen was expended of the breath-packs found in the wreckage of the Challenger.|$|R
5|$|All {{apprentices}} were to {{be educated}} in reading, writing and arithmetic {{for the first four}} years of their apprenticeship. The Act specified that this should be done every working day within usual working hours but did not state <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> should be set aside for it. Educational classes should be held {{in a part of the}} mill or factory designed for the purpose. Every Sunday, for one hour, apprentices {{were to be}} taught the Christian religion; every other Sunday, a divine service should be held in the factory, and every month the apprentices should visit a church. They should be prepared for confirmation in the Church of England between the ages of 14 and 18 and must be examined by a clergyman at least once a year. Male and female apprentices were to sleep separately and not more than two per bed.|$|E
5|$|One day, {{after trying}} to make the troublemaker Zhang {{apologize}} for bothering another student, Wei discovers that Zhang has left to go find work in the nearby city of Zhangjiakou. The village mayor is unwilling to give her money for a bus ticket to the city, so she resolves to earn the money herself, and recruits the remaining students to help. One girl suggests that they can make money by moving bricks in a nearby brickyard, and Wei begins giving the students mathematical exercises centered on finding out how much money they need to earn for the bus tickets, how many bricks they need to move, and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> it will take. Through these exercises and working to earn money, her rapport with the class improves. After earning the money, she reaches the bus station but learns that the price is higher than she thought, and she cannot afford a ticket. Wei ends up walking most of the way to Zhangjiakou.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived at}} its final destination of Libreville on 21 March, after twenty-seven days. The {{block of ice}} was found to weigh 2,714kg; it had lost only 336kg along the way. Though it was unclear <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> the expedition would take, Klevan had initially estimated a loss of 10%; the end result was approximately 11%. A French representative of the company met the crew in Libreville. A personal friend of President Charles de Gaulle, he presented an offer to drive the ice back to Paris. If the crew accepted, the President himself would have received the crew under the Arc de Triomphe. The men, however, were too exhausted at that point to contemplate such an offer. Instead, arrangement were made for the vehicles to be brought back by freight, while the crew would fly home. The ice was cut up and divided between the citizens of Libreville, for whom this was a rare commodity. Klevan, always conscious of promotional opportunities, brought {{a portion of the}} ice back home with him. This ice was subsequently used in drinks served to journalists at the première of the expedition documentary back home in Oslo.|$|E

25|$|When {{deciding}} whether to optimize a specific part of the program, Amdahl's Law should always be considered: {{the impact on the}} overall program depends very much on <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> is actually spent in that specific part, which is not always clear from looking at the code without a performance analysis.|$|E
25|$|<b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> Atkinson {{devoted to}} his law {{practice}} after moving to Chicago is unknown, but {{it is unlikely to}} have been a full-time career, given his amazing output during the next 15 years as a writer, editor, and publisher in the fields of New Thought, yoga, occultism, mediumship, divination, and personal success.|$|E
25|$|Riders became {{adept at}} {{circumventing}} controls. Their advisers learned to calculate {{how long it}} would take a drug to move from blood into urine, and therefore <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> a rider could risk waiting before going to a drugs test. And sometimes riders simply cheated. In 1978 the world discovered how it could be done.|$|E

This ensures users are returning accurate results for both scientific and statistical reasons.|$|R
25|$|A water clock uses a flow {{of water}} to measure time. If {{viscosity}} is neglected, the physical principle required to study such clocks is Torricelli's law. There {{are two types of}} water clocks: inflow and outflow. In an outflow water clock, a container is filled with water, and the water is drained slowly and evenly out of the container. This container has markings that are used to show the passage of time. As the water leaves the container, an observer can see where the water is level with the lines and tell <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> has passed. An inflow water clock works in basically the same way, except instead of flowing out of the container, the water is filling up the marked container. As the container fills, the observer can see where the water meets the lines and tell <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> has passed.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} half of the first season, the show's set resembled that of an ancient Roman gladiatorial arena, with the stands raised high above the ground. For the second half, the show's set was changed into a modern indoor sports arena style. An onscreen clock was added in the second half of the season, which allowed viewers to see <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> a {{contender}} had left to complete an event.|$|E
25|$|FairVote has {{conducted}} research on both presidential and Congressional elections. Most of its presidential election {{research focuses on}} the electoral college's effects on campaigning. In its 2012 Presidential Election analysis, FairVote documented the large disparity in both time and money spent in swing states (e.g., Florida) versus safe states (e.g., Maryland). In addition, FairVote has begun publishing data on <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> sitting presidents spend in swing states.|$|E

Lee said, [...] "I was impressed with <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>times</b> have changed; before it would have been impossible to parody the president. The film tries to show that heads of state are only human, just like you and me, which I think makes the movie distinctive, as well as fresh and fun for viewers." ...|$|R

25|$|An {{operating}} system kernel contains a scheduling program which determines <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> each process spends executing, {{and in which}} order execution control should be passed to programs. Control is passed to a process by the kernel, which allows the program access to the CPU and memory. Later, control is returned to the kernel through some mechanism, so that another program may be allowed to use the CPU. This so-called passing of control between the kernel and applications is called a context switch.|$|E
25|$|Kohl {{was a true}} people's {{person and}} loved to be in company of groups. His {{tremendous}} memory about people and their lives helped him to build up his networks in the Christian Democratic Union, in government and abroad. In a study of German chancellorship as political leadership, Henrik Gast gives examples <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> Kohl invested into personal relationships even with the backbenchers in the Bundestag and also party officials up to the local level. This worked, because it fitted Kohl's character and was authentic.|$|E
25|$|The final scene's snowy {{landscape}} was filmed in New Zealand. The ending is deliberately ambiguous, {{and the audience}} is left with several questions: specifically, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> has passed, if Dae-Su's meeting with the hypnotist really took place, whether he successfully lost the knowledge of Mi-do's identity, and whether he will continue his relationship with Mi-do. In an interview with Park (included with the European release of the film), {{he says that the}} ambiguous ending was deliberate and intended to generate discussion; it is completely up to each individual viewer to interpret what isn't shown.|$|E
