5|$|As {{a result}} of erosion of {{sandstone}} and the erosion-resistant sills and dikes, the topography in Minnesota has repeated parallel hills and valleys. The tightly packed lakes in the narrow valleys are long and narrow, and they orient from the east to west. The cliffs in these narrow valleys are the habitat to several rare plants which prefer living in narrow cliff areas in a sub-Arctic climate. In Ontario the Rove Formation is overlain by a thick <b>diabase</b> cap.|$|E
5|$|Stone wool or {{rock wool}} is a spun mineral fibre {{used as an}} {{insulation}} product and in hydroponics. It is manufactured in a blast furnace fed with <b>diabase</b> rock which contains very low levels of metal oxides. The resultant slag is drawn off and spun to form the rock wool product. Very small amounts of metals are also produced which are an unwanted by-product and run to waste.|$|E

The mafi c swarm {{comprises}} <b>diabases,</b> metadiabases and amphibolites. Metadiabases originatedfrom uralitization of <b>diabases.</b> These rocks have tholeiitic affi nity and predominant basaltic composition. Some samples are andesi-basalts. The ages of <b>diabases</b> and metabasites are 1380 ± 32 Ma and 1330 ± 120 Ma respectively. Geochemical data indicate that the compositional variation of <b>diabases</b> and metadiadases is due to fractional crystallization of evolved tholeiitic magmas. The origin of the basaltic magmas is related to a heterogeneous mantle source...|$|R

Geochemistry of the <b>diabases</b> reveals three distinct groups, including a) supra-subduction zone (SSZ) type, which is characterized by marked Nb-anomaly and normal mid-ocean ridge basalt (N-MORB) like HFSE distribution, b) enriched MORB (E-MORB) type, showing some degree of enrichment relative to N-MORB, c) oceanic-island basalt (OIB) type with characteristic hump-backed trace element patterns, coupled with fractionated REE distribution...|$|R
5000|$|Magmatism {{induced by}} {{continental}} rifting {{just prior to}} and in the Cambrian Period produced the granites and rhyolites (the red rocks), gabbroic rocks, anorthosites, and <b>diabases</b> (the black rocks).|$|R
5|$|After the Rove sediments were deposited, the Penokean orogeny {{added more}} land mass by {{accretion}} that occurred from the south. A few {{hundred million years}} later the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent Rift zone, which is a bow-shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas, arcing through the present-day Lake Superior Basin and then angling southeast through Michigan. Then came a period of advancing and retreating glaciers. The more resistant <b>diabase</b> sills and dikes remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. The north path of glaciation is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges.|$|E
5|$|The library, {{the last}} of the palace's rooms to be completed, is based on Sir Walter Scott's own library, {{revealing}} the personal friendship that Blore had with Scott. Inside, the library features about 6,000 literary and musical works of the 18th and 19th centuries. The interior's woodwork, including the doors, panelling, and ceilings, is made out of oak. The walls are adorned in cloth, with designs made by Dutch, Flemish, French, and Italian painters. The palace's Gothic fireplaces are made out of polished <b>diabase.</b>|$|E
5|$|This was a fast-spreading rift; the {{resulting}} basalts show little {{interaction with the}} then-existing rock. These immense volumes of mafic lava were generated in two major pulses, mostly via a hot mantle plume. Along the North Shore of Lake Superior, {{one can see the}} solidified lava (igneous rock) most everywhere. In the Rove region the magma didn't reach the surface; it intruded into fractures in the formation and slowly cooled to become <b>diabase</b> (rather than basalt). These solidified bodies are the Pigeon River and Logan Intrusion diabases.|$|E

The analyses and the laboratory tests have been performed on samples of <b>diabases</b> and quartz keratophyre. The samples were taken from the surface layers. The results from their physical and mechanical analyses showed that these rocks meet the requirements for their utilization as construction stone suitable for all fractions of asphalt – concrete, concrete aggregate, material for compaction of roads, stone dust and other application in the civil engineering related to the traffic infrastructure. Additionally, the quality of the stone is higher in the deeper parts of the terrain, where the external influences have little effect...|$|R
40|$|This work intends {{primarily}} {{to survey the}} field, mineralogical and petrographic characters of the mafic dykes which occur on a stretch of 650 km along the Southeastern coast of Brazil, between the city of São Sebastião, and the island of Santa Catarina. New chemical and geochronological data are also presented. The coastal dyke swarms are envisaged as {{the northern and southern}} arms of a plume-generated triple junction system centered on the Paraná State coast, and related to the initial opening of the South Atlantic. Mafic magma intruded as dyke swarms along three directions: N-S (the southern arm, along the Paraná-Santa Catarina coast), NW-SE (Ponta Grossa arch) and NE-SW (the northern arm along the São Paulo coast). Fifty two dykes, almost all tholeiitic <b>diabases,</b> were mapped and sampled along the south arm coast. The Ponta Grossa arch dykes are chiefly composed of tholeiitic <b>diabases</b> and lesser intrusions of andesitic to rhyolitic composition. Over 240 dykes were sampled and identified along the north arm west of São Sebastião. Lamprophyres are here abundant, followed by <b>diabases,</b> microdiorite porphyries and lesser amounts of trachy-andesite, carbonatite and Precambrian dykes. Special attention was given to the study of lamprophyres, their field appearance relative abundance, mineral and chemical composition, enclaves and relations to neighboring alkaline intrusions.

5|$|When {{continental}} glaciers {{moved over}} the Rove Formation area, the ice was a hundreds of meters thick and its surface sloped gently southward from the Patrician center to the north. The {{base of the}} ice sheet encountered the cuesta topography relief {{of a few hundred}} feet. Because the ice over the valleys would be thicker than the ice over the ridges, obstructed extrusion flow would operate and resulted in the removal of the easily quarried slates of the valleys. The ridges would not be appreciably eroded, partly because the ice would be thinner over the ridges and therefore less plastic, and partly because of the resistance of the <b>diabase</b> to both quarrying and abrasion by the ice.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{has some}} of the most ancient rocks found in any U.S. National Park. The oldest rocks dated so far are 2,680 ± 12million years old, though even older rocks are {{believed}} to exist in the park. Formed during the Archean Eon (4 to 2.5billion years ago), these metamorphic rocks include gneiss, schist and amphibolites. Metamorphic rocks are the most common types found in the northern and southern sections of the Teton Range. 2,545million years ago, the metamorphic rocks were intruded by igneous granitic rocks, which are now visible in the central Tetons including Grand Teton and the nearby peaks. The light colored granites of the central Teton Range contrast with the darker metamorphic gneiss found on the flanks of Mount Moran to the north. Magma intrusions of <b>diabase</b> rocks 765million years ago left dikes that can be seen on the east face of Mount Moran and Middle Teton. Granite and pegmatite intrusions also worked their way into fissures in the older gneiss. Precambrian rocks in Jackson Hole are buried deep under comparatively recent Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary deposits, as well as Pleistocene glacial deposits.|$|E
40|$|The Leg 173 Site 1067 and 1068 amphibolites and metagabbros {{from the}} west Iberia margin exhibit {{variable}} whole-rock compositions from primitive to more evolved (Mg numbers = 49 - 71) that are generally incompatible trace and rare earth element enriched (light rare earth element [LREE] = 11 - 89 x chondrite). The Site 1067 amphibolites are compositionally similar to the basalts reported at Site 899 from this same region, based on trace and rare earth element contents. The Site 1068 amphibolites and metagabbros {{are similar to the}} Site 899 <b>diabases</b> but are more LREE enriched. However, the Sites 1067 and 1068 amphibolites and metagabbros are not compositionally similar to the Site 900 metagabbros, which are from the same structural high as the Leg 173 samples. The Leg 173 protoliths may be represented by basalts, <b>diabases,</b> and/or fine-grained gabbros that formed from incompatible trace element-enriched liquids...|$|R

5|$|In {{common with}} most of the Orkney isles, Shapinsay has a bedrock formed from Old Red Sandstone, which is {{approximately}} 400 million years old and was laid down in the Devonian period. These thick deposits accumulated as earlier Silurian rocks, uplifted by the formation of Pangaea, eroded and then deposited into river deltas. The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of these eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The composition of Shapinsay is mostly of the Rousay flagstone group from the Lower Middle Devonian, with some Eday flagstone in the southeast formed in wetter conditions during the later Upper Devonian. The latter is regarded as a better quality building material than the former. At Haco's Ness in the south east corner of the island is a small outcrop of amygdaloidal <b>diabase.</b> The island is overlain with a fertile layer of boulder clay formed during the Pleistocene glaciations.|$|E
25|$|At Fulufjället, the {{sandstone}} is veined with <b>diabase.</b> This <b>diabase</b> {{is particularly important}} in the area, since it forms a much richer substrate than sandstone for vegetation. Additionally, it resists erosion better than sandstone and therefore forms prominent structures in the countryside. For example, the peak Brattfjället, highest zone in the park, is situated {{in one of the}} largest <b>diabase</b> zones. The <b>diabase</b> is a little less than 300 million years old, which corresponds to the formation of the Oslo Rift. This suggests that these diabases are connected to that rifting event.|$|E
25|$|The {{continent}} {{was later}} riven, creating {{one of the}} deepest rifts in the world. The lake lies in this long-extinct Mesoproterozoic rift valley, the Midcontinent Rift.

25|$|The {{principal}} rock of {{the park}} is the granite of Nordingrå, the park belonging to the Nordingrå massif. It consists of a rapakivi granite, formed about 1500 million years ago.

To the north-east {{of the park}}, one can also find <b>diabase,</b> which was formed 1200 million {{years ago in the}} faults of the Nordingrå massif. Since granite forms a substrate very poor in nutrients, the <b>diabase</b> constitutes by contrast a very fertile terrain, which permits a richer vegetation.|$|E

40|$|Mafic-layered {{intrusions}} and sills and spatially associated andesitic basalts {{are well}} {{preserved in the}} Funing area, SW China. The 258 ± 3 Ma-layered intrusions are composed of fine-grained gabbro, gabbro and diorite. The 260 ± 3 Ma sills consist of undifferentiated <b>diabases.</b> Both the layered intrusions and volcanic rocks belong to a low-Ti group, whereas the <b>diabases</b> belong to a high-Ti group. Rocks of the high-Ti group have FeO, TiO 2 and P 2 O 5 higher but MgO and Th/Nb ratios {{lower than those of}} the low-Ti group. They have initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios (0. 706 - 0. 707) lower and εNd (- 1. 5 to - 0. 6) higher than the low-Ti equivalents (0. 710 - 0. 715 and - 9. 6 to - 4. 0, respectively). The high-Ti group was formed from relatively primitive, high-Ti magmas generated by low degrees (7. 3 - 9. 5 %) of partial melting of an enriched, OIB-type asthenospheric mantle source. The low-Ti group may have formed from melts derived from an EM 2 -like, lithospheric mantle source.

There is very little coarser-grained gabbro and <b>diabase.</b> Nephelinite is exposed on the islands but is extremely rare. The majority of eruptions in Hawaii are Hawaiian-type eruptions because basaltic magma is relatively fluid compared with magmas typically involved in more explosive eruptions, such as the andesitic magmas that produce some of the spectacular and dangerous eruptions around {{the margins of the}} Pacific basin.|$|E
25|$|Located in the Tijuca Range, Pedra da Gávea is 842m (2,762ft) tall, and is {{a granite}} dome.
