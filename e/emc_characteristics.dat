40|$|Presently, the {{existing}} failure reporting system at Banverket (the Swedish Rail Administration), which handles {{reports on the}} failures of the railway infrastructures and possible causes of failure, is not optimum (or most suitable) when it comes to analysis of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) - related failures and causes. This failure reporting system is reliant on correct reporting into the system, so that the right information can be sent back to the users, the maintenance and service personnel, in real time. In general railway infrastructure operates in a complex and non-homogeneous environment where low power electronics has to function in the same environment as large voltages and currents from trains. The environment close to the railway tracks is heavily polluted by electromagnetic (EM) noise from the railway systems themselves. The reliability of railway signalling, communication, and control systems depends on the degree of galvanic isolation from EM noise. When new technologies are implemented into old installations, the complexity of the system increases, leading to new challenges which necessitate new forms of skill and competence to deal with these issues and challenges. The new technologies which are to be integrated into the old systems, or which are to be applied to build new systems, must meet the requirements for EMC in order to obtain a high degree of system reliability and ensure the problem-free operation of such systems. The complexity of the infrastructure is not easy to simulate or calculate, and consequently it is important to observe the real systems and their characteristics in real situations. Therefore, measurements were performed on real systems in operation. To perform an audit of the problems in the railway systems leading to EM noises and failures, investigations were made by studying the real systems in operation and using {{the existing}} failure (and inspection) reporting system of Banverket. A large number of measurements were made on site at detectors and signalling systems and installations. By studying and analyzing the measured data and failure reports from the databases, an effort was made to understand the causes of faults related to EMI (Electromagnetic interferences). Thereafter, visual inspection was carried out in the engineering constructions, i. e. signal and detector boxes, to verify if the recurring faults are caused by poorly designed installations and their physical environment. The visual inspections were concentrated on EMC and to the areas from where the power and communication cables entered the locations selected for study, by examining the areas where the sensitive equipment was placed. Through the visual inspection it was found that there could be improvements in two problem areas, namely installations and instructions from the suppliers of equipment, which often result in wrong installations. During this study, measurements were performed at sites which had extensive EMC and EMI problems. The measurements clearly show the erratic characteristics of the equipment and systems used in signalling and detector installations, mainly leading to EMC and EMI problems. For example, the measurements from detectors show that random transients appear even when a train is not present, and the measurements in the signal box show a completely different behaviour where the measuring equipment showed a reading of over - 100 volts in a 27 V system. These measurements and the results from the subsequent analyses show EMI characteristics which are totally unexpected. The detailed analysis of the failure reporting systems and databases shows that most of the failure causes are related to EMC problems. The fault reporting system is not configured to identify the failure causes as EMC or EMI problems. Therefore, this has to be investigated to identify the cause so that corrective actions can be initiated to restore the system to an operating condition. The research study has helped in understanding the function of railway signalling and detector installations from an EMC and EMI point of view. The knowledge generated will be of assistance in designing new signalling and detector equipment which will have a higher level of reliability, leading to a smaller number of failures and EMC problems. The study has made a contribution towards an understanding of the <b>EMC</b> and EMI <b>characteristics</b> of the signalling and detector infrastructure of the railway system. These characteristics often lead to failures resulting in train delays. Godkänd; 2008; 20081128 (ysko...|$|R

40|$|Ordinary Pulse-Width-modulated signals have spectrums that hasn’t {{got good}} <b>EMC</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The {{trapezoidal}} pulses have got short rise- and fall-times and this causes both conducted as radiated interference. In the literature, there exist several methods {{for dealing with}} this problem. For instance, there exist random modulation techniques, and spread-spectrum techniques. Here, the harmonics of the PWM-waveform are smeared across a wider frequency domain and this causes the magnitude to decrease. Hence, an easier filtering of the harmonics is possible. A {{first part of this}} thesis consists of evaluating how these random and spread-spectrum techniques have advantages with respect to ordinary PWM. Both a theoretical study and an experimental can be performed. Induction motors, connected to a Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) are widely applied in industry. The motors are driven by square wave PWM voltages. The dv/dt’s of these voltages are very high (order 10 ^ 9 V/s). In three-phase inverters with three half-bridges, there is a common-mode (CM) voltage because the PWM-signals are inherently asymmetrical. These CM-voltage generates a leakage current, that flows through the parasitic capacitance between ground and motor, and through the motor cable. The problem is not only a bad EMC, {{but there is also a}} voltage across the motor axis and a bearing current which reduces the lifetime of the bearings. The seconds purpose of this thesis is to evaluate improved PWM-techniques for mitigating above mentioned problems in VSI-driven motors. The focus in this part is on techniques which reduce CM. Following parameters can be studied for comparing the different PWM-methods: leakage current, voltage across the axis, bearing current, CM at motor connections, conducted EMI at the output of the inverter, conducted EMI of high frequency in the motor cable, maximal modulation index, … References: [1] A.

Otsinka remaining resources needed to justify energy efficiency improvements electromechanical systems using the method of calculating the cost of the life cycle. In calculating life cycle cost LCC one of the main tasks is to determine the residual life of the equipment. The article shows that the lifetime of the electromechanical system is largely determined by the quality of the motor winding insulation. The main factor that affects the lifetime of the insulation is its operating temperature.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} contributions {{within the}} field of numerical simulations of electromagnetic properties using the Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) method. Numerical simulations of electromagnetic properties are of high industrial interest. The two major fields of use are to ensure compliance with electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) regulations and to verify functionality in electronic designs. International EMC regulations bounds companies that develop or assemble electric products to market products that are electromagnetic compatible with other products in their environment. Failure to comply with regulations can result in products withdrawal and fines. To avoid incompatibility, numerical simulations can be used to improve <b>EMC</b> <b>characteristics</b> in the development and assembly stage in a cost efficient way. Functionality of today's compact high-performance electronic systems can be affected by unwanted internal electromagnetic effects. The result can be degradation of performance, malfunction, and product damage. Numerical simulations are used to predict electromagnetic effects at the design phase, thus minimizing the need for post-production actions delaying product releases and increasing product cost. At the Embedded Internet System Laboratory (EISLAB), Luleå University of Technology, a project concerning numerical simulations of electromagnetic properties in electric systems using the PEEC method is in progress. This thesis focuses {{on the development of the}} PEEC method for practical use, thus demanding optimal performance of the basic sections within a PEEC based electromagnetic solver in terms of speed and accuracy. In the PEEC method, the two most demanding sections are the partial element calculations and the solution of the final equation system. The latter problem is a pure mathematical problem with continuous progress while the partial coefficient calculations require further research. This thesis proposes several techniques for efficient partial element calculations. First, a discretization strategy is used for one-layer structures to enable the use of fast analytic formulas and the resulting simplified PEEC models are solved using a freeware version of SPICE, exemplifying the accessibility of the PEEC method. Second, a fast multi- function method is proposed in which different order of numerical integration is used, in the calculation of the partial elements, depending on a predefined coupling factor. Third, the fast multi-function method is further developed and compared to a fast multipole method applied to partial element calculations. Fourth, the calculation of the three- dimensional node coefficients of potential is addressed and three novel approaches are presented and evaluated in terms of speed and accuracy. The thesis includes a paper dealing with nonorthogonal PEEC models. This model extension allows the use of nonorthogonal volume and surface cells in the discretization of objects. This facilitates the modeling of realistic complex structures, improves accuracy by reducing the use of staircase- approximations, and reduces the number of cells in the PEEC model discretizations. The nonorthogonal formulation excludes the use of analytical formulas thus make topical the use of fast multi-function- and multipole-methods. The fundamentals of the PEEC method makes free-space radiation analysis computationally efficient. Radiated field characterization is important in EMC processes and therefore of great interest. One paper in this thesis explore different possibilities to use PEEC model simulations to determine the electric field emissions from objects. Godkänd; 2003; 20061022 (ysko...|$|E
