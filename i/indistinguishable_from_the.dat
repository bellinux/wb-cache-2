5|$|A {{telecommunications}} network {{is a collection}} of transmitters, receivers, and communications channels that send messages to one another. Some digital communications networks contain one or more routers that work together to transmit information to the correct user. An analog communications network consists of one or more switches that establish a connection between two or more users. For both types of network, repeaters may be necessary to amplify or recreate the signal when it is being transmitted over long distances. This is to combat attenuation that can render the signal <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> noise.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} above, John Scannella {{had argued}} in 2010 that Nedoceratops {{should be considered}} a synonym of Triceratops. Andrew Farke (2011) maintained that it represents a valid distinct genus. Nick Longrich agreed with Scannella about Nedoceratops and made a further suggestion: that the recently described Ojoceratops was likewise a synonym. The fossils, he argued, are <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> T. horridus specimens that were previously attributed to the defunct species T. serratus.|$|E

5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star, where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> brighter primary companion. If this is the case, then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system {{would have to have}} a mass that is less than 0.55 times that of the Sun. A search for a binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E
5|$|Early church {{buildings}} may originally {{have been}} wooden, like that excavated at Whithorn, but of those for which evidence survives from this era are basic masonry-built churches, beginning {{on the west}} coast and islands and spreading south and east. Early chapels tended to have square ended converging walls, similar to Irish chapels of this period. Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the Highlands they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outside from houses or farm buildings.|$|E
5|$|Eaton's pintail has two subspecies, A. e. eatoni (the Kerguelen pintail) of Kerguelen Islands, and A. e. drygalskyi (the Crozet pintail) of Crozet Islands, and was {{formerly}} considered conspecific {{with the northern}} hemisphere's northern pintail. Sexual dimorphism is much less marked in the southern pintails, with the male's breeding appearance being similar to the female plumage. Unusually for a species with such a large range, northern pintail has no geographical subspecies if Eaton's pintail is treated as a separate species. A claimed extinct subspecies from Manra Island, Tristram's pintail, A. a. modesta, appears to be <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nominate form.|$|E

5|$|The {{black stork}} {{is a member}} of the genus Ciconia, or typical storks, a group of seven extant species, characterised by {{straight}} bills and mainly black and white plumage. The black stork was long thought to be most closely related to the white stork (C. ciconia). However, genetic analysis via DNA–DNA hybridization and mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA by Beth Slikas in 1997 found that it was basal (an early offshoot) in the genus Ciconia. Fossil remains have been recovered from Miocene beds on Rusinga and Maboko Islands in Kenya, which are <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> white and black storks.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Christianity into Scotland from Ireland from {{the sixth century}} led {{to the construction of}} basic masonry-built churches, beginning on the west coast and islands. Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the Highlands they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outside from houses or farm buildings. However, from the eighth century, more sophisticated buildings emerged. Early Romanesque ashlar masonry produced block-built stone buildings, like the eleventh century round tower at Brechin Cathedral and the square towers of Dunblane Cathedral and The Church of St Rule.|$|E

5|$|Although to many she is {{best known}} for Demi's Birthday Suit, art aficionados {{consider}} her most famous work Disappearing Model. The work appeared on Ripley's Believe it or Not!. In the trompe l'oeil body painting, the face and body of the model are almost <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> red and blue and yellow flowers of the wallpaper in the background. Her first body paintings was also memorable as she painted a moko on a female Ford Modeling Agency fashion model named Jana, which is a tabooed employment of a traditionally male ritual face mask. An example from Gair's website of her ability to trick the eye into seeing a three-dimensional subject blend with a two-dimensional background is seen in a photograph of a pregnant Elle Macpherson. Other examples of this technique include the cover of her first book (pictured below) and images from within this book.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{policy was}} put forward in 1923 by the Australian Labor Party, {{which was in}} opposition for all but {{two years of the}} 1920s and 1930s. It called for Australia's first line of defence to be a powerful air arm, supported by a well-equipped Australian Army that could be rapidly expanded to meet an invasion threat. This, in turn, required a strong munitions industry. Labor politicians cited critics like Rear Admiral William Freeland Fullam, who drew attention to the vulnerability of warships to aircraft, naval mines and submarines. The Labor Party's Albert Green noted in 1923 that when a battleship of the day cost £7,000,000 while an aircraft cost £2,500, there was a genuine cause for concern as to whether the battleship was a better investment than hundreds of aircraft, if the aircraft could sink battleships. The Labor Party's policy became <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Army's position.|$|E
5|$|Grim Fandango mixed static pre-rendered {{background}} {{images with}} 3D characters and objects. Part {{of this decision}} was based on how the calaca figures would appear in three dimensions. There were more than 90 sets and 50 characters in the game to be created and rendered; Manny's character alone comprised 250 polygons. The development team found that by utilizing three-dimensional models to pre-render the backgrounds, they could alter the camera shot to achieve more effective or dramatic angles for certain scenes simply by re-rendering the background, {{instead of having to}} have an artist redraw the background for a traditional 2D adventure game. The team adapted the engine to allow Manny's head to move separately from his body to make the player aware of important objects nearby. The 3D engine also aided in the choreography between the spoken dialog and body and arm movements of the characters. Additionally, full motion video cutscenes were incorporated to advance the plot, using the same in-game style for the characters and backgrounds to make them nearly <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> actual game.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the free}} peasants of Anglo-Saxon society appear to have lost status and become <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> non-free serfs. Whether this change was due entirely to the conquest is unclear, but the {{invasion}} and its after-effects probably accelerated a process already under way. The spread of towns and increase in nucleated settlements in the countryside, rather than scattered farms, was probably accelerated by {{the coming of the}} Normans to England. The lifestyle of the peasantry probably did not greatly change in the decades after 1066. Although earlier historians argued that women became less free and lost rights with the conquest, current scholarship has mostly rejected this view. Little is known about women other than those in the landholding class, so no conclusions can be drawn about peasant women's status after 1066. Noblewomen appear to have continued to influence political life mainly through their kinship relationships. Both before and after 1066 aristocratic women could own land, and some women continued {{to have the ability to}} dispose of their property as they wished.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Marge {{has begun}} to panic over being unable to {{communicate}} with Homer, as she knows nothing of his undercover work and cannot get any information on his whereabouts. She is surprised and thrilled when he returns home with his prison sentence lifted, but Homer feels guilt for Fat Tony's death and bitterness toward the government over being used to bring him down. Homer visits Fat Tony's grave to apologize, but is kidnapped by his cousin Fit Tony, who plans to kill him for revenge. However, Fit Tony spares his life after Homer tells {{of the time he}} and Fat Tony spent together, seeing that Fat Tony lives on in Homer's memories. Fit Tony takes charge of the syndicate, but the stress of the position causes him to overeat and gain weight, becoming known first as Fit Fat Tony and then simply Fat Tony - now physically <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original.|$|E
5|$|Parish church {{architecture}} in Scotland was often much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the highlands {{they were often}} even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outside from houses or farm buildings. However, there were some churches built in a grander continental style. French master-mason John Morrow was employed at the building of Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilding of Melrose Abbey, both considered fine examples of Gothic architecture. The interiors of churches were often more elaborate before the Reformation, with highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell. The carvings at Rosslyn Chapel, created in the mid-15th century, elaborately depicting the progression of the seven deadly sins, are considered {{some of the finest}} in the Gothic style. Late medieval Scottish churches also often contained elaborate burial monuments, like the Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas.|$|E

5|$|The Friday the 13th films {{generally}} received negative reception {{from professional}} critics, {{in contrast to}} other slashers like Halloween. Critics disliked how the series favored high body counts over plot and character development and how each film was almost <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> last. Nevertheless, the films were a financial success, prompting Paramount to release more sequels contingent on the box office appeal. When comparing Friday the 13th to the other top-grossing American slasher franchises—A Nightmare on Elm Street, Child's Play, Halloween, the Hannibal Lecter series, Psycho, Saw, Scream, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre—and adjusting for the 2011 inflation, Friday the 13th is the highest grossing horror franchise in the United States, with approximately $687.1 million. A Nightmare on Elm Street follows with $592.8 million, with the Hannibal Lecter film series closely behind with $588.7 million. Then comes Halloween with $557.5 million, Saw with $457.4 million, Scream with $442.9 million, Psycho with $376.3 million, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre with $304.6 million, and the Child's Play film series rounding out the list with approximately $203 million. The financial success has extended to home release, with more than five million DVDs sold by 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically as Phacidium dentatum by Johann Karl Schmidt in 1817. Italian botanist Giuseppe De Notaris moved it to Lophodermium in 1847. In 1877, Pier Andrea Saccardo transferred it to Coccomyces, giving it its current name. The variety C.dentatus var. hexagonus, described by Otto Penzig and Saccardo from West Java, Indonesia in 1901, is sometimes applied to western US collections with large six-sided apothecia. However, its status is unclear, as the type {{is no longer}} in Saccardo's herbarium at the University of Padua, and Penzig's collection was destroyed during World War II. C.dentatus f. lauri was described by Heinrich Rehm in 1901, for a collection found growing on a species of Lauraceae in Rio Grande do Sul (southern Brazil). According to English botanist Martha Sherwood, who revised the genus Coccomyces in 1980, it is <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main type and should be considered synonymous.|$|E
5|$|The water mould (oomycete) Bremia lactucae has {{infected}} commercial {{crops in}} Italy and California. In 2002 on the Ligurian coast, widespread infection of several cultivars, most severely 'Florabella Pink' {{and to a}} lesser extent 'Florabella Gold' and 'Florabella White', resulted in leaf blistering and the development of chlorotic lesions on the leaves, and white patches on the undersides, particularly in areas of poor ventilation. There was an outbreak of downy mildew in a cultivated crop of Xerochrysum bracteatum in San Mateo County, California in 2006, in which the leaves developed large chlorotic lesions. A Phytoplasma infection damaged X.bracteatum crops in the Czech Republic between 1994 and 2001, causing poor growth, bronzing of foliage, and malformation of flower heads. Genetically, the pathogen was <b>indistinguishable</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> agent of aster yellows. The root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) attacks and forms galls on the roots, which leads to the morbidity or death of the plant.|$|E
