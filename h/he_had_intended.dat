5|$|After {{completing}} his elementary {{education in the}} public schools, Johnson attended Vanderbilt Preparatory School for Boys, a Methodist institution in Elkton, Kentucky. He finished his preparatory coursework in 1914 and matriculated to Central Methodist College in Fayette, Missouri. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>intended</b> to continue his studies at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, but he interrupted his studies to enlist in the U.S. Army for service in World War I.|$|E
5|$|Bosi had {{previously}} been head chef and won a Michelin star at the Overton Grange restaurant, just outside the town. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>intended</b> to open a restaurant in Warwickshire, but found the premises too expensive and purchased a 25-year lease on the former Oaks property in Ludlow for £40,000. Within a year Hibiscus won its first Michelin star, {{and at the same}} time Overton Grange was downgraded before going into receivership.|$|E
50|$|An {{original}} Kuwaiti is {{a person}} who settled in Kuwait before 1920. A person who believes that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> maintained his normal residence in Kuwait even though he is living in another country if <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>intended</b> to go back to Kuwait is also an original Kuwaiti.|$|R
5000|$|Whoever {{goes to his}} {{bed with}} the {{intention}} of getting up and praying during the night, but, being overcome by sleep, fails to do that, <b>he</b> will <b>have</b> recorded for him what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>intended,</b> and his sleep will be reckoned as a charity (an act of mercy) for him from his Lord. Al-Nasa'i and Ibn Maja ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him again, with the same supplication of {{powerful}} love, and that same transcendent, frightening light of triumph. In view of the delicate flame which {{seemed to come from}} her face like a light, he was powerless. And yet <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never <b>intended</b> to love her. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> never <b>intended.</b> And something stubborn in him could not give way.|$|R
5|$|Homer is {{told that}} he has an overdue book from the library, which he checked out when Bart was a baby. He says that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>intended</b> to read to Bart every day, but various things had gotten in his way. Before he returns it, he reads from the book, telling three stories.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other forms}} of camouflage, the {{intention}} of dazzle is not to conceal but to {{make it difficult to}} estimate a target's range, speed, and heading. Norman Wilkinson explained in 1919 that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>intended</b> dazzle primarily to mislead the enemy about a ship's course and so to take up a poor firing position.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of his}} {{contract}} with the Batavian Society, van Kinsbergen had to take photographs of Borobudur, which had just been cleaned and restored. However, {{when he went to}} photograph the Panataran Hindu temple complex in East Java in 1867, he ran out of chemicals. In his enthusiasm for photographing the many reliefs of the temple complex, he used up so many glass slides that he could not go to Borobudur as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>intended</b> to. The Society was nervous about van Kinsbergen's delay, so they did not grant his request to supply new slides.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Richard Whiteley, Plater claimed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never <b>intended</b> to write sensational plot-driven sagas with outlandish characters and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never <b>intended</b> to make the sort of [...] "rubbish programmes featuring high speed car crashes {{of which there are}} too many on television". Plater said that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> always tried to make his characters normal people, whose normal lives are interrupted when the outside world comes into their lives.|$|R
60|$|But {{after all}} danger, {{so far as}} this party was concerned, had disappeared, Bob {{was by no means}} {{inclined}} to relax his vigilance. He stationed his men in the positions <b>he</b> <b>had</b> originally <b>intended</b> they should occupy, supplied each of them with a generous lunch, with the addition of hot coffee, and even gave a portion to the solitary officer at the well, when <b>he</b> <b>had</b> originally <b>intended</b> that <b>he</b> should go hungry.|$|R

5|$|Even {{more than}} his debts, the Earl of Leicester's will {{triggered}} litigation. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>intended</b> his illegitimate son from his early 1570s relationship with Douglas Sheffield, the adolescent Robert Dudley, to inherit Kenilworth {{after the death of}} his brother, Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick. Some of the countess' jointure manors lay in the castle's vicinity, while at the same time they had been assigned to the younger Dudley's inheritance by the overseers of Leicester's will. After Warwick's death in February 1590, lengthy legal proceedings ensued over whether particular parts of Lady Leicester's jointure belonged to the Kenilworth estate or not.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>intended</b> {{to go to}} the bar, but in the October term of 1802 he chanced to hear Charles Simeon {{speaking}} of the good done in India by a single missionary, William Carey, and some time afterwards he read the life of David Brainerd, a missionary to the Native Americans. He resolved, accordingly, to become a missionary himself. On 22 October 1803, he was ordained deacon at Ely, and afterwards priest, and served as Simeon's curate at the Church of Holy Trinity, taking charge of the neighbouring parish of Lolworth.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 {{interview}} with the Jakarta Globe {{after the release of}} his controversial film ?, Bramantyo said that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>intended</b> Sang Pencerah to use Dahlan's life to examine different aspects of Islam. He meant for the film to show Islam as being a peaceful and truthful religion. Pramono, writing for Tempo, notes that the film presents a different side of Dahlan, who is usually portrayed as an old, bearded man who, in his opinion, seems neither modernist nor progressive.|$|E
50|$|A {{wealthy man}} is shot {{just as he}} reaches for the phone to call for the police. Suspicion falls on his ward (Lila Lee) as <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>intended</b> to change his will, which had left his entire estate to her, to share it equally with his nephew. The nephew, who is in love with Lee, calls in a private detective, who {{eventually}} finds it is the lawyer who is the criminal.|$|R

5000|$|When Maguire was 26, Au Bon Pain {{handed him}} [...] "his {{first chance to}} turn around an operation. The project was a 17,000-square-foot {{commissary}} in a building under the Tobin Bridge charged with providing salads, juice, and baked goods to the Au Bon Pain locations without their own kitchens. The commissary was a disaster." [...] The lesson he learned there about motivating his employees is one <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>intended</b> to take to Friendly's.|$|R
5|$|The Hungarian Scout {{program had}} four stages. During {{the first three}} years, Bánáthy {{advanced}} three stages. The last stage required Bánáthy to earn 25 merit badges. This last stage was called Turul, after the mythical bird of Hungary. From spring to fall, as weather permitted, the patrol had many outings. Every summer the troop went on a two- to three-week long summer camp. Bánáthy and his troop attended the 4th World Scout Jamboree in 1933. Up until this time, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>intended</b> to follow his father into the ministry, but changed his mind.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} was incensed by the untraditional proposal, but Rodin would not yield. In 1895, Calais succeeded in having Burghers displayed in their preferred form: {{the work was}} {{placed in front of}} a public garden on a high platform, surrounded by a cast-iron railing. Rodin had wanted it located near the town hall, where it would engage the public. Only after damage during the First World War, subsequent storage, and Rodin's death was the sculpture displayed as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>intended.</b> It is one of Rodin's best-known and most acclaimed works.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{outcome is}} unknown, {{since it has}} two {{versions}} which differ depending on the source. In the first version Nikola Jurišić rejected the offer to surrender on favourable terms, {{and in the second}} version, the city was offered terms for a nominal surrender. Suleiman, having been delayed nearly four weeks, withdrew at the arrival of the August rains, and did not continue towards Vienna as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>intended,</b> but turned homeward.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> not <b>intended</b> to let {{her know}} that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seen her with the baboons; but quite suddenly, before he {{realized}} what he was saying, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> blurted it out.|$|R
60|$|Clavering went; but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> left an {{unpleasant}} impression behind him, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> perhaps <b>intended,</b> while {{soon after he}} took his departure Flora Schuyler found her friend alone.|$|R

5|$|Although Musique funèbre was internationally acclaimed, his new {{harmonic}} techniques led {{to something}} of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which he still could not see how to express his musical ideas. Then on 16 March 1960, listening to Polish Radio broadcast on new music, he happened to hear John Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra. Although he was not influenced by the sound or {{the philosophy of the}} music, Cage's explorations of indeterminacy set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching. His Three Postludes were hastily rounded off (<b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>intended</b> to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{advancement}} of his legal career had been hindered by his marriage to Jane, Hogg hoped to receive a legal appointment from a politically connected acquaintance. This was not an immediate option because the Whig party was in opposition, but {{in the summer of}} 1827 Henry Brougham promised Hogg a future position as a professor of civil law at the newly created University College London. Hogg embarked on a course of study in preparation, but the professorship was not established owing to a lack of funds. This setback upset Hogg greatly, and he became very bitter about it. A lecture that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>intended</b> to give at his inauguration was published in 1831.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{also built}} the Savoy Hotel in London, and {{acquired}} other luxury hotels. In addition, he erected the Palace Theatre, London, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>intended</b> {{to be the}} home of a new school of English grand opera, although this ambition was not realised beyond the production of a single grand opera by Sullivan, Ivanhoe. Nevertheless, his partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, and his careful management of their operas and relationship, created a series of works whose success was unprecedented in the history of musical theatre. His opera company, later operated by Helen and then by his son, Rupert, and granddaughter, Bridget, promoted those works for over a century, and they are still performed regularly today.|$|E
6000|$|She stepped {{a little}} closer to him as if she feared some one might hear her. [...] "Dickory," [...] said she, [...] "he did not put that thing into my mind; it was there already. That was a dreadful ship, Dickory, and it was filled with dreadful men. If <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not <b>intended</b> to go with them <b>he</b> would not <b>have</b> put himself into their power, and if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not <b>intended</b> to be long away <b>he</b> would not <b>have</b> planned to leave me here with my uncle." ...|$|R

5|$|Goldfinger {{was written}} in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1958 and was the longest typescript Fleming had {{produced}} to that time. He initially gave the manuscript the title The Richest Man in the World. Fleming had originally conceived the card game scene as a separate short story but instead used the device for Bond and Goldfinger's first encounter. Similarly, the depressurisation of Goldfinger's plane was another plot device <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>intended</b> to use elsewhere, but which {{found its way into}} Goldfinger. Some years previously a plane had depressurised over the Lebanon and an American passenger had been sucked out of the window and Fleming, who was not a comfortable airline passenger, had made note of the incident to use it.|$|E
5|$|Hubbard {{stated in}} his eighteen-page after-action report that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>intended</b> {{to force the}} {{submarine}} to surface {{so that it could}} be attacked by the surface vessels' guns. He reported that his vessel had seen oil on the surface, though the PC-815 took no samples, and asserted that the blimps had seen air bubbles, oil and a periscope, though the blimps' own reports did not corroborate this. No wreckage was seen, despite the heavy depth-charging. The PC-815 sustained some minor damage and three crew were injured during the incident when the ship's radio antenna was accidentally hit by gunfire. At midnight on 21 May, with depth charges exhausted and the presence of a submarine still unconfirmed by any other ship, PC-815 was ordered back to Astoria.|$|E
5|$|In August 1793, Kościuszko, though {{worried that}} an {{uprising}} {{would have little}} chance against the three partitioning powers, returned to Leipzig, where he was met with demands to start planning one as soon as possible. In September he clandestinely crossed the Polish border to conduct personal observations and meet with sympathetic high-ranking officers in the residual Polish Army, including General Józef Wodzicki. The preparations went slowly, and he left for Italy, planning to return in February 1794. However, the situation in Poland was changing rapidly. The Russian and Prussian governments forced Poland to again disband most of her army, and the reduced units were to {{be incorporated into the}} Russian Army. In March, Tsarist agents discovered the revolutionaries in Warsaw and began arresting notable Polish politicians and military commanders. Kościuszko was forced to execute his plan earlier than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>intended</b> and, on March 15, 1794, set off for Kraków.|$|E
50|$|A {{car crash}} in May 2007 {{put an end}} to his running career. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> been <b>intending</b> to run the 5000m at the Ugandan National Athletics Championships in July 2007.|$|R
50|$|A {{day after}} the long program, Lambiel {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> long <b>intended</b> to sit out the 2010 World Championships. On 9 March 2010, he announced his retirement from competition.|$|R
