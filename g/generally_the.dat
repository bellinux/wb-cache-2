El Paso and Amarillo are exceptions with July and December respectively being the warmest and coldest months respectively, but with August and January only being narrowly different.|$|E
5|$|A few early issued {{items were}} {{embossed}} but <b>generally</b> <b>the</b> post-paid impressed stamps were typographed. The Revenue Stamping Branch, Dublin Castle, applied the impressed indicia until 1984, when An Post employed the typographic printing method.|$|E

5|$|Although shoe polish is {{primarily}} intended for leather shoes, some brands specify {{that they may}} be used on non-porous materials, such as vinyl. The polish is <b>generally</b> <b>the</b> same colour as the shoes it will be used upon, or it may be neutral, lacking any intrinsic colour.|$|E
5|$|By {{fine-tuning}} {{the surface}} roughness, {{it is possible}} to achieve a transition between both superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic regions. <b>Generally,</b> <b>the</b> rougher the surface, the more hydrophobic it is.|$|E
5|$|Cabaniss's {{academic}} rankings remained <b>generally</b> <b>the</b> same in his {{following year}} at the academy. His scores in drawing, mathematics, and physics were above average, while his merits in French language and history were among the worst. He finished 33rd {{in the class of}} 66. He maintained his spot as the most disciplined in his class, earning fewer than half the demerits than the second-best.|$|E
50|$|Most reviews <b>generally</b> praise <b>the</b> {{quiet and}} subtle {{nature of the}} film along with the {{performances}} of the two young actresses. Negative reviews <b>generally</b> cite <b>the</b> lack of dialogue and slow plot progression.|$|R
50|$|Accommodation {{essentially}} {{means that}} when the ciliary muscle contracts, the lens becomes more convex, <b>generally</b> improving <b>the</b> focus for closer objects. When it relaxes, it flattens <b>the</b> lens, <b>generally</b> improving <b>the</b> focus for farther objects.|$|R
50|$|Under Swiss law, {{insolvency}} or foreclosure {{may lead}} to the seizure and auctioning off of assets (<b>generally</b> in <b>the</b> case of private individuals) or to bankruptcy proceedings (<b>generally</b> in <b>the</b> case of registered commercial entities).|$|R
5|$|Dark {{energy in}} its {{simplest}} formulation {{takes the form}} of the cosmological constant term in Einstein's field equations of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more <b>generally,</b> <b>the</b> details of its equation of state and relationship with the Standard Model of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and theoretically.|$|E
5|$|For {{wives and}} {{families}} of prisoners of war, life under the occupation was particularly hard. In pre-war France, the husband was <b>generally</b> <b>the</b> household's chief wage earner, so many households saw {{a sharp drop}} in income and living standards.|$|E
5|$|Fustat {{developed}} {{as a series of}} tribal areas, khittas, around the central mosque and administrative buildings. The majority of the settlers came from Yemen, with the next largest grouping from western Arabia, along with some Jews and Roman mercenaries. Arabic was <b>generally</b> <b>the</b> primary spoken dialect in Egypt, and was the language of written communication. Coptic was still spoken in Fustat in the 8th century.|$|E
50|$|There is no perfect {{solution}} since {{in most cases}} the increase of one attribute <b>generally</b> results in <b>the</b> decreased attractiveness of another. Reduced stretch <b>generally</b> also reduces <b>the</b> flexibility causing a trade-off of performance for durability. Solving both problems <b>generally</b> sends <b>the</b> price out of range for most sailors.|$|R

5|$|<b>Generally,</b> <b>the</b> areas {{affected}} {{are exposed}} skin not usually protected by clothing; however {{it can also}} occur in areas covered by clothing. Areas constantly subjected to the sun's rays may only be slightly affected if at all. People with extreme cases will also have reactions to light bulbs that emit a UV wavelength (any bulb {{that is not an}} LED). Parts of the body only thinly covered can also potentially be subjected to an outbreak.|$|E
5|$|<b>Generally,</b> <b>the</b> {{finding of}} a {{combination}} of a low pituitary hormone together with a low hormone from the effector gland is indicative of hypopituitarism. Occasionally, the pituitary hormone may be normal but the effector gland hormone decreased; in this case, the pituitary is not responding appropriately to effector hormone changes, and the combination of findings is still suggestive of hypopituitarism.|$|E
5|$|<b>Generally,</b> <b>the</b> first {{bones to}} be {{affected}} are the fingers, facial bones, ribs, and pelvis. Long bones, which are longer than they are wide, are also among the first affected. As the disease progresses, any bone may be affected.|$|E
50|$|Casinos {{offering}} <b>the</b> jackpot <b>generally</b> have <b>the</b> cards shuffled by a card shuffling machine - {{the cards}} are then removed and dealt {{out by the}} dealer, or croupier.

5|$|In 1940 some of {{the class}} were reallocated to Crewe North (5A) and Glasgow Polmadie (27A, 66A from 1950). As the numbers grew, Crewe North was <b>generally</b> <b>the</b> beneficiary, but in 1946 Carlisle Upperby (12B, 12A from 1958), {{received}} an initial allocation of six locomotives. At various times locomotives were also seconded to Liverpool Edge Hill (8A). A typical allocation of the 1950s was Camden 15, Crewe North 10, Polmadie 9 and Upperby 4.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{fried chicken}} has stereotypically been {{associated}} with African-Americans. The reasons for this are various. Chicken dishes were popular among slaves before the Civil War, as chickens were <b>generally</b> <b>the</b> only animals slaves were allowed to raise on their own. Minstrel shows and the film The Birth of a Nation led to a prevalent stereotype associating African-Americans with fried chicken.|$|E

5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{associated with}} the Churches of Christ embrace the methods of modern Biblical criticism but not the associated anti-supernaturalistic views. More <b>generally,</b> <b>the</b> classical grammatico-historical method is prevalent, which provides a basis for some openness to alternative approaches to understanding the scriptures.|$|E
5|$|Rain is {{heaviest}} from July through September, when {{about half}} of the park's annual average precipitation falls during short, violent thunderstorms.
