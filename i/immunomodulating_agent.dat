However, despite optimal treatment CHF remains a syndrome with poor prognosis. For this reason, {{a large number of}} new agents have been developed as add-on treatment over the last few years. Vasopeptidase inhibitors, moxonidine, endothelin antagonists, vasopressin antagonists, and selective aldosterone antagonists, are some of the new agents that were designed to interfere with different neurohormonal pathways. <b>Immunomodulating</b> <b>agents,</b> growth hormone, caspase inhibitors, adrenomedullin, and erythropoietin have different modes of action, which in general are less understood. Although most of the agents exhibited efficacy in preclinical trials, the clinical results have not always been similarly positive.

Other compounds like caspase inhibitors, adrenomedullin, and vasopressin antagonists are still at the early stages of development.

40|$|Human {{peripheral}} blood eosinophils released eosinophil survival- enhancing activity when stimulated with the calcium ionophore, ionomycin. The {{release of activity}} was detected as early as 3 h after stimulation and was inhibited by an <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agent,</b> cyclosporin A. The survival-enhancing activity was completely abolished by treatment with anti-interleukin 3 (IL- 3) and anti- granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, IL- 3 and GM-CSF were measurable in ionomycin- stimulated eosinophil supernatants by immunoassay. Eosinophils produced approximately one-half as much IL- 3 and one-fifth as much GM-CSF as ionomycin-stimulated mononuclear cells. Neutrophils also produced IL- 3 and GM-CSF, but the amounts were less than those produced by eosinophils.

40|$|Objectives: To {{present the}} {{systematic}} literature review (SLR), which {{formed the basis}} for the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) evidence-based recommendations for vaccination in adult patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD). Methods: AIIRD, vaccines and immunomodulating drugs, as well as eight key questions were defined by the multidisciplinary expert committee commissioned by EULAR for developing the recommendations. A SLR was performed using MedLine through October 2009 and including data from meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized trials, and observational studies, excluding case series with participants. Articles in English and regarding patients years of age, were eligible. Results: Several vaccine-preventable infections (VPI) occur more often in AIIRD-patients and most vaccines are efficacious in AIIRD-patients, even when treated with <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents,</b> except rituximab. There {{does not appear to be}} an increase in vaccination-related harms in vaccinated patients with AIIRD in comparison with unvaccinated patients with AIIRD. However, these studies are underpowered and therefore not conclusive. Conclusion: Based on the current evidence from the literature, recommendations for vaccination in patients with AIIRD were made. However, more research is needed in particular regarding incidence of VPI, harms of vaccination and the influence of (new and established) <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents</b> on vaccination efficacy.

40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is a chronic, itching, inflammatory {{skin disease}} which {{is associated with}} asthma and/or hay fever and a familial occurrence of these conditions. Genetic factors are important {{in the development of}} AD, but the exact hereditary pathway is still unknown. Dry skin and the weakened barrier function in patients with AD is very important for the patient's reactions to irritants and other external trigger factors including microorganisms. The standard treatments are topical corticosteroids, topical <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents,</b> and emollients. If AD cannot be controlled by this type of treatment, systemic <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agents</b> may be used. UVB, UVA, or psoralen-UVA may also be used for widespread severe lesions. However, some patients do not respond to these standard treatment, and then {{it is important to consider}} the role of microorganisms, house dust mites or food. The role of the Malassezia yeasts in AD, especially AD located to the head and neck region, is now documented in several papers. There are also several papers indicating the role of Candida as an aggravating factor in AD. Patients with AD also develop chronic dermatophyte infections more easily, and patients with AD and chronic dermatophyte infections may show improvement in their AD when treated with antifungal drugs...|$|R

40|$|Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), {{also known}} as Devic 2 ̆ 7 s disease, {{is thought to be}} a severe {{inflammatory}} demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that mainly involves the optic nerve and spinal cord. Because of the clinical and pathological manifestation, NMO is considered as a severe form of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here in Japan, it is not only diagnosed as optic-spinal MS, but is often treated with an <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agent,</b> interferon beta. In 2004, NMO-IgG or an autoantibody to aquaporin- 4 of perivascular astroglia and ependymal cells of the CNS, which is a first specific marker of the demyelinating disease, was identified in the serum of NMO patients, and clearly distinguished NMO from MS.

Histopathologic examination of a lingual ulcer revealed a polymorphous lymphohistiocytic proliferation with scattered binucleated atypical lymphocytes. Immunohistochemically, most cells were of T-cell lineage while the EBER test was negative and a diagnosis of MTX-induced reactive ulceration was rendered. MTX cessation resulted in complete resolution of the ulcers with no recurrences reported so far.

40|$|Because {{deficient}} immune responses {{may play}} a contributory role in recurrent herpes simplex labialis, an <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agent,</b> levamisole, has been advocated for therapy. Forty-two patients with a high frequency of recurrent herpes simplex labialis were followed for a mean of 7. 8 months (range 4 to 12) and treated for 3 days {{at the onset of}} each episode of herpes with one of three different doses of levamisole or placebo in a randomized, double-blind study. Statistical analysis revealed that as the dosage increased, so did the frequency of recurrences (P = 0. 007). Conversely, duration of the lesions and lesion pain decreased with increasing dosage (P = 0. 05 and 0. 03). These results indicate that levamisole is not an appropriate drug for the management of recurrent herpes simplex labialis. The paradoxical response to an immunomodulator (increased frequency, decreased severity) provides evidence that altered host responses may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease...|$|E
40|$|The current {{standard}} {{therapy for}} the treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C is the combination of peginterferon and ribavirin, although many patients fail to clear the virus and their retreatment options are still unsatisfactory.

Twenty-four patients, 12 receiving T 1 and 12 standard therapy, were enrolled. Peripheral subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry. While the addition of T 1 did not seem to significantly modify the T lymphocyte subpopulations, since comparable behaviors were observed in the CD 4 and CD 8 longitudinal evaluation, T 1 produced an earlier increase of NK cells.

40|$|A {{search for}} an <b>immunomodulating</b> <b>agent</b> from {{mycobacteria}} was carried out using Mycobacterium leprae. The antigenicity of each fraction of the bacterial membrane, which contains the most antigenic components of M. leprae, was assessed by using sera from paucibacillary leprosy. N-terminal sequencing of the serum-reactive protein and functional assessment of the membrane fractions using monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) identified major membrane protein II (MMP-II) {{as one of the}} efficient T-cell-activating candidates. Purified MMP-II stimulated DCs from healthy individuals to produce interleukin- 12 p 70 and up-regulated the surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I and II, CD 86, and CD 83 molecules. Also, there was an increase in the percentage of CD 83 + cells in the DC population. Furthermore, MMP-II-pulsed DCs expressed their derivatives on their surfaces. Using Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR- 2) -dependent receptor constructs, we found that TLR- 2 signaling was involved in DC maturation induced by MMP-II. Taken together, MMP-II can be recognized as an immunomodulating protein in terms of activation of antigen-presenting cells and innate immunity...|$|E
