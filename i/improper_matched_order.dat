30|$|For each group-to-group {{matching}} operation, we {{obtain an}} initial set of feature point matches. The initial set of feature point matches usually contains some false matches {{due to the}} inaccurate characterization of feature points or the <b>improper</b> <b>matches</b> established in the matching procedure. In the case of matching two uncalibrated images, the epipolar constraint {{can be used to}} reject the false matches [32]. In our experiments, the epipolar constraint is imposed based on the robust estimator RANSAC [33]. The feature point matches that are not consistent with the estimated epipolar geometry are identified as false matches and rejected.|$|R
30|$|On a {{research}} note, {{often in the}} literature, the matching process in retrospective surveys is rather inadequate since the compared groups are not morphologically similar [8, 15, 21, 22]. The <b>improper</b> <b>matching</b> of the groups inevitably introduces susceptibility bias, which {{is defined as the}} difference in prognostic expectations due to pre-existing differences between and/or among treatment groups. When contemplating between different-mutually exclusive-treatment approaches or techniques, a clinician takes into careful consideration the patient’s morphological features. These features usually include cephalometric and model measurements along with other parameters like patient’s age and sex. In statistics, such patient’s features that lead a clinician to a specific treatment decision are called confounding variables.|$|R

50|$|Brace {{matching}}, {{also known}} as bracket matching or parentheses matching, is a syntax highlighting feature of certain text editors and integrated development environments that highlights matching sets of braces (square brackets, curly brackets, or parentheses) in languages such as Java and C++ that use them. The purpose {{is to help the}} programmer navigate through the code and also spot any <b>improper</b> <b>matching,</b> which would cause the program to not compile or malfunction. If a closing brace is left out, for instance, the compiler will not know that the end of a block of code has been reached. Brace matching is particularly useful when many nested if statements, program loops, etc. are involved.|$|R

40|$|A {{stratified}} charge engine {{employing the}} Texaco Controlled Combustion System has been operated {{over a large}} range of load conditions on iso-octane, methanol, and a wide boiling point (100 - 600 F) residual fuel. Basic performance, emissions and combustion parameters were measured over a range of overall equivalence ratios from 0, 1 - 1. 0 at three engine speeds; 1500, 2000 and 2500 RPM. The basic performance and emissions data were found to vary little between iso-octane and residual fuels, and to compare very well with similar data collected on the same engine design at other research facilities. The engine operation on methanol was not entirely satisfactory due to an <b>improper</b> <b>match</b> between the specific fuel injection system used for these experiments and the design requirements imposed by the much lower heating value and higher stoichiometric fuel-air- 3...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We analyze a large roommate problem (i. e., {{marriage}} matching {{in which}} the marriage is not restricted solely to matchings between men and women) with non-transferable utility. It {{is well known that}} while a roommate problem may not have a stable proper matching, each roommate problem does have an stable <b>improper</b> <b>matching.</b> In a random utility model with types from Dagsvik (2000) and Menzel (2015), we show that all improper stable matchings are asymptotically close to being a proper stable matching. Moreover, the distribution of types in stable matchings (proper or not) converges to the unique maximizer of an expression that is a sum of two terms: the average “welfare ” of the matching and the Shannon entropy of the distribution. In the noiseless limit, when the random component of the utility is reduced to zero, the distribution of types of matched pairs converges to the outcome of the transferable utility model. 1...|$|R
40|$|The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program Raman Lidar (CARL) was {{upgraded}} in 2004 with a {{new data}} system that provides simultaneous measurements of both the photomultiplier analog output voltage and photon counts. The so-called merge value added procedure (VAP) was developed to combine the analog and count-rate signals into a single signal with improved dynamic range. Earlier versions of this VAP tended to cause unacceptably large biases in the water vapor mixing ratio during the daytime {{as a result of}} <b>improper</b> <b>matching</b> between the analog and count-rate signals in the presence of elevated solar background levels. We recently identified several problems and tested {{a modified version of the}} merge VAP by comparing profiles of water vapor mixing ratio derived from CARL with simultaneous sonde data over a six month period. We show that the modified merge VAP significantly reduces the daytime bias, and results in mean differences that are within approximately 1 % for both nighttime and daytime measurements...|$|R

50|$|Hapoel {{was very}} {{weak in the}} early sixties. The team {{finished}} 1962-63 one before last, and was supposed to relegate to the second division. But, due to suspicions about <b>improper</b> <b>matches,</b> the relegations were canceled (many {{say that this was}} due to the connections of the heads of Hapoel in the IFA). At this turning point, many talented young players promoted from the youth team, causing a significant improvement that started the club's best period. In the same season, 1962-63, the club won the Israel State Cup, after beating Maccabi Haifa in the final 1-0. In all of the following seasons the team finished in the top third of the league, and qualified to the cup final three more times. The main players of the team at that time were Abba Gindin, Yitzhak Englander, Yochanan Vollach and Roby Young. These players were some of the greatest players in Israeli football in the 1960s and the 1970s and were part of the Israel national team for many years. Roby Young was even the captain of the national team.|$|R
40|$|Constraints on {{availability}} of high-quality planting stock, <b>improper</b> <b>matching</b> {{of the species}} to the planting site and low level of silviculture hamper the success of smallholder tree plantings in Leyte. In spite of the available technologies in nursery and plantation management, smallholders still lack the necessary technical skills. This suggests that insufficient efforts are exerted by concerned agencies in extending the knowledge {{to the level of}} smallholders and it is indeed imperative to design means by which this pool of information can be disseminated. Inasmuch as most tree planting activities involve the establishment of nurseries, use of the nursery sector as a focal point of extension warrants investigation. Potential intervention measures including establishment of model smallholder nurseries to showcase the nursery cultural practices, creating a farmer-based seed distribution network to facilitate the distribution of germplasm and widen the species base, and accrediting the nurseries to improve sales, are suggested. These measures are designed to solve the previously identified problems ultimately promoting a wider adoption of smallholder forestry in the province and eventually in other regions of the country...|$|R

40|$|Brazil is {{the fifth}} largest {{country in the world}} and its present population, in excess of 190 million, is highly heterogeneous, as a result of centuries of {{admixture}} between Amerindians, Europeans, and Sub-Saharan Africans. The estimated individual proportions of biogeographical ancestry vary widely and continuously among Brazilians: most individuals, irrespective of self-identification as White, Brown or Black – the major categories of the Brazilian Census “race/color ” system – have significant degrees of European and African ancestry, while a sizeable number display also Amerindian ancestry. These features have important pharmacogenetic (PGx) implications: first, extrapolation of PGx data from relatively well-defined ethnic groups is clearly not applicable to the majority of Brazilians; second, the frequency distribution of polymorphisms in pharmacogenes (e. g., CYP 3 A 5, CYP 2 C 9, GSTM 1, ABCB 1, GSTM 3, VKORC, etc) varies continuously among Brazilians and is not captured by race/color self-identification; third, the intrinsic heterogeneity of the Brazilian population must be acknowledged in the design and interpretation of PGx studies in order to avoid spurious conclusions based on <b>improper</b> <b>matching</b> of study cohorts.
