40|$|Abstract—Both {{exposure}} duration and concentration determine the lethal consequences of {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) released during oil spills. Many factors, such as weathering, tidal transport, and addition of surfactants, can change the composition of individual dissolved compounds and the duration over which an individual is exposed. Conventional toxicity testing methods produce effect metrics, such as the median lethal concentration (LC 50), that are not applicable to predicting mortality at all toxicant {{exposure duration}}s {{that are likely to}} occur during a spill. In the present study, survival time models were developed that explicitly include toxicant exposure duration and concentration to predict time-to-death for grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) exposed to three PAHs (1 -ethylnaphthalene, 2, 6 -dimethylnaphthalene, and phenanthrene) commonly found in the water-soluble fraction derived from oil. Conventional 48 -h LC 50 s also were calculated for the compounds (<b>ethylnaphthalene,</b> 295 g/L; dimethylnaphthalene, 500 g/L; and phenanthrene, 360 g/L). In contrast to LC 50 s, survival models and associated response surfaces can be used to predict the proportions of shrimp that will die at various times throughout the exposure period.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to understand the fate of naphthalene and n-alkylnaphthalenes during diesel combustion, and an evaluation of their sources in diesel exhaust emissions. This was achieved by the use of a procedure which employed a [14 C]radiolabelled PAH technique and a diesel enriched fuel technique (DEFT). The combustion of diesel fuel spiked with [14 C]naphthalene has shown unequivocally that 0. 5 % of the naphthalene contained in diesel fuel survives combustion under the engine conditions studied (2500 rpm and 50 Nm). The survived naphthalene represented 22. 8 % of the total recovered naphthalene, the other 77. 2 % was presumably pyrosynthetic in nature. The sources of the pyrosynthesised naphthalene in the emissions was investigated at 2500 rpm and 50 Nm. The previously unreported input of n-methylnaphthalenes to the pyrosynthesised naphthalene was demonstrated by combusting fuel spiked with [14 C] 2 -methylnaphthalene. Radiolabelled 2 - methylnaphthalene (0. 53 % of the original [14 C] 2 -methylnaphthalene) which had survived combustion, and radiolabelled naphthalene (0. 02 % of the original [14 C] 2 -methylnaphthalene), were recovered in the exhaust extracts. This showed unequivocally that 2 -methylnaphthalene was converted to naphthalene in the combustion chamber. The first enrichment experiments (DEFT), in which 1 - and 2 -methylnaphthalene were added separately to fuel prior to combustion confirmed that demethylation of both species produced naphthalene in small yields (1. 9 % and 6. 1 % respectively). The contribution of n-alkylnaphthalenes with the alkyl group greater than methyl in length, to pyrosynthesised naphthalene contained in exhaust emissions was investigated using fuel spiked with non-radiolabelled alkyl-PAH. The major product of combustion of these compounds was 2 - vinylnaphthalene, with a 0. 08 % conversion for 2 -butylnaphthalene and a 0. 01 % conversion for 2 - <b>ethylnaphthalene.</b> No dealkylated products were detected in the exhaust emissions. A mechanism for the formation of 2 -vinylnaphthalene was proposed. The effect of engine speed and load on the recovery of naphthalene and the contribution of pyrosynthesised and survived naphthalene to recovered naphthalene were established using [14 C]naphthalene. At all speeds and loads investigated the pyrosynthesised fraction of recovered naphthalene was shown to be dominant...|$|E
40|$|COSMO-RS, the Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents, {{has been}} used to predict a set of basic {{partition}} coefficients of 22 (alkylated) naphthalenes. To validate the approach, methyl-, dimethyl-, and <b>ethylnaphthalenes</b> have been chosen, according to the availability of experimental data. Then, predictions have been extended to diisopropylnaphthalenes. Given the model's expected uncertainty intervals, COSMO-RS predictions of aqueous solubilities, (subcooled) vapor pressures, Henry's law constants, as well as octanol-water partition coefficients, are in agreement with available literature data. Simultaneous overestimation of aqueous solubilities and vapor pressures of comparable magnitude leads to partial error cancellation in the Henry's law constants. Based on physico-chemical property data obtained with COSMO-RS, the Mackay Level III fugacity model, a steady-state, non equilibrium, and regional-scale model, has been applied to exemplary evaluate the tendency of 2, 6 -diisopropylnaphthalene to migrate between media by modelling emissions to each individual medium and calculating the amount present at steady state...|$|R
40|$|Twenty three {{crude oils}} from the Serbian {{part of the}} Pannonian Basin (14 from the Vojvodina Province and 9 from the Drmno Depression) were investigated, aimed at an {{evaluation}} of oil–oil maturity correlation parameters based on the distribution and abundance of saturated biomarkers and alkylarene constituents. Factor and cluster analyses were used for this purpose. Factor analyses using varimax rotation were first run separately, i. e., of maturity parameters based on the abundance of (a) n-alkanes and isoprenoids, (b) steranes and triterpanes, (c) alkylnaphthalenes, and (d) alkylphenanthrenes. These analyses yielded 9 important “maturity factors”. Eight of them, showing higher than 30 % of variance, were further involved in another factor analysis, {{as well as in}} cluster analysis using the Ward method. In this way, all maturity parameters based on saturated biomarkers and alkylarenes were evaluated and ranged, considering the fact that the observed factors represented their linear combinations. The results showed that in the correlation of crude oils from the Serbian part of the Pannonian Basin, the most important were maturity parameters based on isomerization reactions involving one methyl group in thermodynamically less stable α-methylnaphthalenes, <b>ethylnaphthalenes,</b> dimethylnaphthalenes and methylphenanthrenes, and their change into more stable isomers with the methyl group in the β position in the aromatic ring. Processes constituting high loadings factor 2 and factor 3 parameters were also defined. Hierarchy between the “factors” and parameters were controlled, and approved, by cluster analysis using the Ward method. Finally, the investigated crude oils were correlated by factor and cluster analyses, using all the important “maturity factors”. Differences in maturity were observed between the Vojvodina and Drmno Depression crude oils, as well as between oils originating from South Banat, North Banat and the Velebit oil field (Vojvodina locality) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{cytochrome}} P 450 monooxygenase enzyme CYP 101 B 1, from Novosphingobium aromaticivorans DSM 12444, {{efficiently and}} selectively oxidised {{a range of}} naphthalene and biphenyl derivatives. Methyl substituted naphthalenes were better substrates than <b>ethylnaphthalenes</b> and naphthalene itself. The highest product formation activity for a singly substituted alkylnaphthalene was obtained with 2 -methylnaphthalene. The oxidation of alkylnaphthalenes was regioselective for the benzylic methyl or methine C–H bonds. The products from 1 - and 2 -ethylnaphthalene oxidation were highly enantioselective with a single stereoisomer being generated in significant excess. The disubstituted substrate, 2, 7 -dimethylnaphthalene, had a higher product formation activity than either 1 - and 2 -methylnaphthalene. Methyl substituted biphenyls were also better substrates than biphenyl and had similar biocatalytic parameters to 1 -methylnaphthalene. CYP 101 B 1 catalysed oxidation of 2 - and 3 -methylbiphenyl was selective for attack at the methyl C–H bonds. The exception was the turnover of 4 -methylbiphenyl which generated 4 ′-(4 -methylphenyl) phenol as the major product (70 %) with 4 -biphenylmethanol making up the remainder. The drug molecule diclofenac was also regioselectively oxidised to 4 ′-hydroxydiclofenac by CYP 101 B 1. The activity of the CYP 101 B 1 system with naphthalene was more complex {{and the rate of}} NADH oxidation increased over time but very little product, 1 -naphthol, was generated. Addition of samples of 1 -naphthol and 2 -naphthol and low concentrations of 1, 4 -naphthoquinone induced rapid NADH oxidation activity in the in vitro turnovers in both the presence and absence of the cytochrome P 450 enzyme. Hydrogen peroxide was generated in these reactions in absence of the P 450 enzymes demonstrating that the ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase in combination with quinones from naphthol oxidation and oxygen can undergo redox cycling giving rise to a form of uncoupling of the reducing equivalents.
