40|$|In the {{nonlinear}} satellite channel, bandwidth {{and power}} efficient transmission techniques are required, along with compensation for nonlinear <b>distortion.</b> <b>Amplifier</b> nonlinearity combined with pulse shaping results in intersymbol interference (ISI). Here we propose {{and examine the}} performance of several equalization techniques with coded modulation systems which are capable of achieving spectral efficiencies greater than 2 bits/sec/Hz. ^ First, we derive the Maximum Likelihood sequence detector for a Volterra channel model, and compare its structure with receivers based on alternative nonlinear state model. As a suboptimal {{solution to this problem}} we assess the performance of Volterra and linear equalizer, and also ISI canceller for uncoded and trellis coded modulation (TCM). ^ For (noninterleaved) TCM over the satellite channel, combined equalization and decoding is possible. We propose a novel reduced complexity Maximum Likelihood decoder for the Volterra channel model. Performance analysis for the proposed system is also given. Both the analysis and simulation results confirm the significant performance improvement. ^ The application of turbo code to the satellite channel is also possible. We assess the performance of TTCM (turbo TCM) and propose a novel combined equalization and decoding scheme for TTCM. Performance comparison with the conventional (separate) Volterra type equalizer and the data predistorter is presented. ^ As an extension of our research, we investigate an advanced receiver structure for the terrestrial DTV (digital TV) channel. Among several issues in the channel, error propagation problem in DFE (decision feedback equalizer) is mainly covered in this thesis. We propose a novel method which combines soft input DFE and SOVA TCM decoder to mitigate error propagation in DFE. The proposed scheme gives significant performance gain over the conventional DFE and TCM decoding scheme. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{project details}} {{the design and}} {{evaluation}} of an operational amplifier designed in XF 40, a 40 Volt bipolar process. Initially the signal path circuitry of the amplifier is outlined. Design decisions are chiefly formed around high voltage and high current drive functionality. A novel topology is introduced which compensates base current errors introduced by the individual stages, resulting in a very low (first-order canceled) overall input-referred voltage offset. Novel features are introduced which expand the functionality of the amplifier. Input stage gm is configurable, allowing for the tuning of amplifier bandwidth for a given gain configuration. A robust current-limiting architecture is implemented which allows for a user-configurable output current limit. When this current limit is reached, the amplifier latches into an alternate mode of operation, protecting the amplifier and the load. We utilize disjoint voltage supply rails at the input and output of the amplifier, substantially minimizing overall power dissipation. The chosen topology permits this feature without the introduction of additional errors. We introduce a "boosting" circuit which extends the large signal bandwidth and slew rate of the amplifier. Amplifier performance is evaluated through simulation in Cadence and ADICE (SPICE). The amplifier is capable of driving 1 Ampere through capacitive and resistive loads. The result is a low <b>distortion</b> <b>amplifier</b> with microvolt-order input-referred offset (VOS), 65 MHz large signal bandwidth, and 3000 V/[mu]s slew rate, powered at 20 mA quiescent current. by Alec Julius Poitzsch.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to create a one sensor high resolution acoustic emission measurement system. To obtain this goal, two low noise and <b>distortion</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are designed, with gains of 46 dB and 60 dB. Gain could be reduced by 6 dB using relay switched voltage dividers. Amplified signal then goes to active low pass 7 th order filter, unbalanced to balanced signal converter and finally to 16 bits analog to digital converter (ADC). Those circuits, together with six power supply regulators (three of them are used for ADC power supply), are layout on single printed circuit board (PCB), which consist of approximately 170 elements. In addition, another PCB is designed to reduce electromagnetic interference of field programmable gate array (FPGA) matrix.

40|$|Selected mapping (SLM) is a {{well-known}} method for reducing peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. However, {{as a consequence of}} implementing SLM, OFDM receivers often require estimation of some side information (SI) in order to achieve successful data recovery. Existing SI estimation schemes have very high computational complexities that put additional constraints on limited resources and increase system complexity. To address this problem, an alternative SLM approach that facilitates estimation of SI in the form of phase detection is presented. Simulations show that this modified SLM approach produces similar PAPR reduction performance when compared to conventional SLM. With no <b>amplifier</b> <b>distortion</b> and in the presence of non-linear power <b>amplifier</b> <b>distortion,</b> the proposed SI estimation approach achieves similar data recovery performance as both standard SLM–OFDM (with perfect SI estimation) and also when SI estimation is implemented through the use of an existing frequency-domain correlation (FDC) decision metric.

5000|$|Some audiophiles {{believe that}} the {{clipping}} behavior of vacuum tubes {{with little or no}} negative feedback is superior to that of transistors, in that vacuum tubes clip more gradually than transistors (i.e. soft clipping, and mostly even harmonics), resulting in harmonic distortion that is generally less objectionable. In general though, the distortion associated with clipping is unwanted, and is visible on an oscilloscope even if it is inaudible. Even in a transistorised amplifier with hard clipping, the gain of the transistor will be reducing (leading to nonlinear distortion) as the output current increases and the voltage across the transistor reduces close to the saturation voltage (for bipolar transistors), and so [...] "full power" [...] for the purposes of measuring <b>distortion</b> in <b>amplifiers</b> is usually taken as a few percent below clipping.|$|R
