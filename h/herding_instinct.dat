This style of Border Collie has become popular in winning show kennels around the world, as well as among prestigious judges.

50|$|Pembroke Welsh Corgis {{are very}} affectionate, {{love to be}} {{involved}} in the family, and tend to follow wherever their owners go. They have a great desire to please their owners, thus making them eager to learn and train.

Besides herding, they also function as watchdogs due to their alertness and tendency to bark only as needed. Most Pembrokes will seek the attention of everyone they meet and behave well around children and other pets. It is important to socialise this breed with other animals, adults, and children when they are very young to avoid any anti-social behavior or aggression later in life. Due to their <b>herding</b> <b>instinct,</b> they love to chase anything that moves, so it is best to keep them inside fenced areas. The <b>herding</b> <b>instinct</b> will also cause some younger Pembrokes to nip at their owners' ankles.|$|E
