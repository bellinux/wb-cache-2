This paper analyzes reaching ambitious emission targets up to 2050, either [hyphen (true graphic) ] 10 % or [hyphen (true graphic) ] 50 % from 1990 levels, and how the economic burden from mitigation efforts could be equitably shared between countries. The scenarios indicate a large low-cost mitigation potential in electricity and industry, while reaching low emission levels in international transportation and agricultural emissions might prove difficult. The two <b>effort</b> <b>sharing</b> approaches, Triptych and Multistage, were compared in terms of equitability and coherence. Both approaches produced an equitable cost distribution between countries, with least developed countries having negative or low costs and more developed countries having higher costs. There is, however, no definitive solution on how the costs should be balanced equitably between countries. Triptych seems to be yet more coherent than other approaches, as it can better accommodate national circumstances. Last, challenges and possible hindrances to effective mitigation and equitable <b>effort</b> <b>sharing</b> are presented. The findings underline the significance of assumptions behind <b>effort</b> <b>sharing</b> on mitigation potentials and current emissions, the challenge of sharing the effort with uncertain future allowance prices and how inefficient markets might undermine the efficiency of a cap-and-trade system.

These non-ETS sectors include (non aviation) transport, buildings, agriculture and waste. The Decision establishes national emission targets below which each Member State is committed to limit its non-ETS {{greenhouse gas emissions}} by 2020. This report analyses the possible contribution of the transport sector in the <b>Effort</b> <b>Sharing</b> Decision targets at Member State level and at EU level. The analysis is based on the TREMOVE model scenarios, including sensitivity cases on GDP and oil price. According to the most recent scenario, at aggregated EU 27 level, the transport sector (excluding aviation) would contribute to a - 28 Mton CO 2 emission reduction by 2020 compared with 2005. This represents about 10 % of the non-ETS sector emission reduction target at EU 27 level. At Member State level, the expected contribution is in a very wide range.

40|$|To reduce GHG emissions, the EU 27 {{countries}} committed {{themselves in}} 2007 {{to reduce emissions}} from 1990 levels by 20 % by 2020. In January 2008, the EU commission gave the first country-specific proposals to reduce emissions in sectors outside the EU emission trading system (non-ETS). In this study, we looked at several ways of sharing emission reductions in the non-ETS sector. We considered population and economic growth as significant drivers {{of the development of}} emissions. In particular, we analyzed development in GHG intensity of economies. Reduction requirements vary greatly among countries depending on the principle of <b>effort</b> <b>sharing.</b> The results of our calculations can be perceived as examples of how <b>effort</b> <b>sharing</b> between the EU Member States could look like when certain assumptions are made. Generally they illustrate the sensitivity of the results to data used, assumptions made, and method applied. The main strength of simple top-down approaches is transparency. A major weakness is a very limited ability to consider national circumstances. Political negotiations are ultimately crucial; an analysis like this provides material for negotiations and makes a contribution to solving the effort-sharing problem. As future development is partly unpredictable, implementation of some kind of subsequent adjustment could be considered during the process...|$|E

40|$|Europe's 2020 {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) reduction target {{consists of two}} sub-targets: one for the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) sectors {{and one for the}} non-ETS sectors. The non-ETS target covers CO 2 emissions in buildings, transport and non-ETS industry and non-CO 2 GHG emissions. The non-ETS target is known as Europe's <b>Effort</b> <b>Sharing</b> Decision. This article discusses the GDP per capita method the European Commission has applied in setting Member State specific targets for the non-ETS ("the effort sharing") and shows that it results in an imbalanced reduction effort among the Member States. It turns out that the principal mechanism of the GDP per capita method (low-GDP countries get room to catch up with high-GDP countries by allowing them to increase emissions) is obscured by the non-CO 2 GHGs, the baseline projections of which are highly policy-induced and not correlated with the growth of GDP per capita. We propose an alternative method that (1) corrects for the policy-induced decrease of non-CO 2 GHG emissions and (2) is based on energy savings potentials. This approach could be used in future target setting for non-ETS sectors - including in the case that the overarching EU-wide target would be strengthened - and would provide a direct support to Europe's energy savings ambitions and policies.

Although knowledge makes an agent more productive (productivity effect), knowledge transfer could cause the agent to become self-employed. The agent would then become a strong competitor of the principal (competition effect). I show that there is also an effort effect, which determines the principal’s optimal knowledge transfer and his preference for either a principal-agent relationship or a duopo-listic competition with the agent. The principal’s decision depends crucially on whether knowledge transfer leads only to a relative competitive advantage for the agent, or addi-tionally to an absolute advantage when the agent becomes self-employed. I also show that teamwork makes a principal-agent relationship more attractive for the principal and that such <b>effort</b> <b>sharing</b> leads to lower costs. JEL-Classification: L 2, M 2. ...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{sophistication of}} {{component}} technologies {{and the rising}} costs and uncertainties of developing and launching new products require firms to collaborate {{in the development of}} new products. However, the management of new product development that occurs jointly between firms presents a new set of challenges in sharing {{the costs and benefits of}} innovation. Although collaboration enables each firm to focus on what it does best, it also introduces new issues associated with the alignment of decisions and incentives that have to be managed alongside conventional performance and timing uncertainties of new product development. In this paper, we conceptualize and formulate the joint development of products involving two firms with differing development capabilities and examine the implications of arrangements that go beyond sharing of revenues to include sharing of development cost and work. We term these approaches that involve sharing of the development cost and sharing of the development work investment sharing and innovation sharing, respectively. These cost and <b>effort</b> <b>sharing</b> mechanisms have subtle interactions with the degree to which revenues are shared between firms and the type of development project under consideration. Our analysis shows that investment and innovation sharing are particularly relevant for products with no preexisting revenues, and their benefits also depend on the degree to which revenues are shared between the firms. Whereas investment sharing is more attractive for new-to-the-world product projects with significant timing uncertainty, innovation sharing plays an important role in environments where projects experience product quality uncertainty, firms are similar in their capabilities, and the costs of integration of work across firms can be controlled. Our key contribution involves the modeling of joint work and decision making between collaborating firms and unearthing the complementary role of revenue, cost, and innovative <b>effort</b> <b>sharing</b> mechanisms for new product development. We translate our analytical findings into a managerial framework and illustrate the results with examples from the life-sciences and electronics industries. codevelopment, project alliances, product and supply chain innovation, technology uncertainty...|$|E
