40|$|To {{abstract}} physical into virtual computing infrastructures is {{a longstanding}} goal. Efforts in the computing industry started with early work on virtual machines in IBM's VM 370 operating system and architecture, continued with extensive developments in distributed {{systems in the}} context of grid computing, and now involve investments by key hardware and software vendors to efficiently virtualize common hardware platforms. Recent efforts in virtualization technology are driven by two facts: (i) technology push [...] new hardware support for virtualization in multi- and many-core hardware platforms and in the interconnects and networks used to connect them, and (ii) technology pull [...] the need to efficiently manage large-scale data-centers used for utility computing and extending from there, to also manage more loosely coupled virtual execution environments like those used in cloud computing. Concerning (i), platform virtualization is proving to be an effective way to partition and then efficiently use the ever-increasing number of cores in many-core chips. Further, I/O Virtualization enables I/O device sharing with increased device throughput, providing required I/O functionality to the many virtual machines (VMs) sharing a single platform. Concerning (ii), through server consolidation and VM migration, for instance, virtualization increases the flexibility of modern enterprise systems and creates opportunities for improvements in operational efficiency, power consumption, and the ability to meet time-varying application needs. This thesis contributes (i) new technologies that further increase system flexibility, by addressing some key problems of existing virtualization infrastructures, and (ii) it then directly addresses the issue of how to exploit the resulting increased levels of flexibility to improve data-center operations, e. g., power management, by providing lightweight, efficient management technologies and techniques that operate across the range of individual many-core platforms to data-center systems. Concerning (i), the thesis contributes, for large many-core systems, insights into how to better structure virtual machine monitors (VMMs) to provide more efficient utilization of cores, by implementing and evaluating the novel Sidecore approach that permits VMMs to exploit the computational power of parallel cores to improve overall VMM and I/O performance. Further, I/O virtualization still lacks the ability to provide complete transparency between virtual and physical devices, thereby limiting VM mobility and flexibility in accessing devices. In response, this thesis defines and implements the novel Netchannel abstraction that provides complete location transparency between virtual and physical I/O devices, thereby <b>decoupling</b> <b>device</b> access from device location and enabling live VM migration and device hot-swapping. Concerning (ii), the vManage set of abstractions, mechanisms, and methods developed in this work are shown to substantially improve system manageability, by providing a lightweight, system-level architecture for implementing and running the management applications required in data-center and cloud computing environments. vManage simplifies management by making it possible and easier to coordinate the management actions taken by the many management applications and subsystems present in data-center and cloud computing systems. Experimental evaluations of the Sidecore approach to VMM structure, Netchannel, and of vManage are conducted on representative platforms and server systems, with consequent improvements in flexibility, in I/O performance, and in management efficiency, including power management.

Due to the better performance in terms of harvested power and in terms of electric load decoupling, a self-powered SECE interface has been prototyped. In response to 2 m/s 2 56, 2 Hz sinusoidal input, experimental power recovery of 0. 56 mW is achieved demonstrating that the device is compliant with standard low-power electronics requirements...|$|R
40|$|Harnessing the {{potential}} of single crystal inorganic nanowires for practical advanced nanoscale applications requires not only reproducible synthesis of highly regular one-dimensional (1 D) nanowire arrays directly on device platforms but also elegant device integration which retains structural integrity of the nanowires while significantly reducing or eliminating complex critical processing steps. Here we demonstrate a unique, direct, and bottom-up integration of a semiconductor 1 D nanowire, using zinc oxide (ZnO) as an example, to obtain a vertical surround-gate field-effect transistor (VSG-FET). The vertical device structure and bottom-up integration reduce process complexity, compared to conventional top-down approaches. More significantly, scaling of the vertical channel length is lithographically independent and <b>decoupled</b> from the <b>device</b> packing density. A bottom electrical contact to the nanowire is uniquely provided by a heavily doped underlying lattice-match substrate. Based on the nanowire-integrated platform, both n- and p-channel VSG-FETs are fabricated. The vertical device architecture has {{the potential}} for use in tera-level ultrahigh-density nanoscale memory and logic devices. As device dimensions continue to shrink into the nanometer length scale regime, fundamental physical limits and eco-nomics are likely to hinder further scaling according to Moore’s law. 1 New strategies including usage of new materials, innovative device architectures, and smart integra...|$|R
