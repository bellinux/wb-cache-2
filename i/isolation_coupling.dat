40|$|This paper proposes the {{new design}} of compact ultra {{wideband}} (UWB) 3 dB coupled-line coupler and 90 ° power divider. The proposed coupler utilizes zig-zag-shaped slot at the ground plane underneath microstrip coupled-line to enhance the bandwidth and coupling strength significantly. The technique has alleviated the need of a very narrow spacing between parallel coupled-line for easier fabrication process. The proposed coupler is then being implemented into the new proposed structure of 90 ° power divider that requires an appropriate phase difference of − 90 ° with equal power division across UWB frequency range. The design of 3 dB coupled-line coupler and 90 ° power divider are realized using Rogers TMM 4 substrate, which simulated by using CST Microwave Studio. Excellent UWB performances are achieved in terms of input reflection coefficient, <b>isolation,</b> <b>coupling</b> factor and transmission coefficients...|$|E

This paper presents the design of microstrip directional coupler without the prior knowledge of the physical geometry. A general configuration directional coupler {{will be determined by}} creating a layout in the Agilent Advanced Design System (ADS) and momentum. In order to perform simulation, a substrate as well as metallization and mesh should be defined. Hence, the required s-parameter response of the coupler could be obtained. The design will then fabricate on top of RT Duroid 6010 substrate, and finally undergo measuring through Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) to evaluate their S-parameter characteristics. Simulated results show insertion loss, <b>isolation,</b> <b>coupling</b> (10. 82 dB), and return loss were within the acceptable limits. Directivity of better than 23 dB was achieved in the simulated response. The coupling (9. 99 dB) of fabricated circuit shows a good agreement with the required specification (10 dB), but the directivity 10. 61 dB is quite low in practice. The reason for the discrepancy could, however, due to discontinuities, measuring errors, and fabrication error. However, coupling values show a good agreement between the simulation and measured results...|$|E

The characteristics of the microwave devices are found by proper examination of S-parameters, which relates power levels at different ports by using s-parameter values, auxillary parameters like insertion, <b>isolation,</b> <b>coupling,</b> VSWR,reflection coefficient etc., can be obtained. Network Analyzer is a sophisticated testing device {{which is used to}} characterize active and passive components, such as amplifiers, mixers, duplexers, filters, couplers, and attenuators.

Components can have one port (input or output) or many ports. The ability to measure the input characteristics of each port, as well as the transfer characteristics from one port to another, gives designers the knowledge to configure a component {{as part of a larger}} system. In this paper we find the different auxiliary parameters for different X-band microwave components like directional coupler, attenuator, isolator and circulator.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the design, analysis, and experimental validation of a high-directivity and high coupling microwave directional coupler. The motivating application is in broadband signal routing between cores of multi-core processors, where the delay of simple wire interconnects introduces unacceptable latency. The performance goals include scalability with frequency, a coupling coefficient of 3 dB, directivity larger than 40 dB, high return loss, low insertion loss below 3 dB {{at the center}} frequency, and small footprint. The approach to this problem taken in the thesis {{is a combination of}} edge and broad-side coupling in a multi-layer, multi-conductor microstrip coupled-line system. The two coupling mechanisms between neighboring pairs of coupled lines, along with appropriate end interconnections, allow for reduced size and design that achieves equal propagation velocities for the different modes supported by the five-conductor guiding structure that contribute to coupling. To validate the approach, a coupler designed for operation at 1 GHz is demonstrated to have a isolation of - 22 dB with a coupling coefficient of 3 dB and a return loss of - 20 dB. The coupler is implemented on a FR- 408 substrate with a permittivity of 3. 66 and 1. 17 mm and 0. 17 mm thicknesses, and a total area of 12. 65 cm^ 2. Three metalization layers are used in the design, with edge and broad-side coupled pairs of lines on the top two layers and diagonal end interconnects between the top and bottom lines. The coupler design is then scaled to 3 GHz by shortening the coupled-line length, and established - 24 dB <b>isolation,</b> <b>coupling</b> of 3 dB, return loss of - 20 dB, and has a total area of 6. 9 cm^ 2. The analysis of the coupler shows that full-wave electromagnetic modeling agrees well with measurements and is necessary during the design process, while circuit analysis with built-in coupled-line models shows poorer agreement with experimental data. A tolerance analysis shows that the coupler performance is most sensitive to milling precision and separation between coupled-lines. Based on the measured and simulated results, it is shown that this type of coupler can be further scaled to higher frequencies and on-chip implementations for signal distribution in multi-core processors, or any other application where a number of components need to be interconnected with low latency and no reflection.

40|$|Maldives {{is a small}} island-atoll {{developing}} country dominated by the Indian Ocean. It has many of the typical characteristics associated with island developing countries. Island-atoll developing countries "face difficult development decisions in a world economy that has changed little {{to respond to the}} aspirations of the smallest states" (Connell, 1986 : 41). Smaller geographical size implies limited land based natural resource availability (see Tisdell and Fairbairn, 1983; Tisdell, 1987). The limited land based natural resource availability limits the foreign exchange earnings from their potential exports. Furthermore, even if diversification is possible, which is questionable, small size coupled with economies of scale in transport (brought about as a result of geographic isolation), production and marketing, limits the degree of diversification (Fairbairn and Kakazu, (1985). Also geographic <b>isolation</b> <b>coupled</b> with smallness is a disincentive to overseas investment.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Natural {{products}} {{remain an}} important source of drug candidates, but the difficulties inherent to traditional <b>isolation,</b> <b>coupled</b> with unacceptably high rates of compound rediscovery, limit the pace of natural product detection. Here we describe a reactivity-based screening method to rapidly identify exported bacterial metabolites that contain dehydrated amino acids (i. e., carbonyl- or imine-activated alkenes), a common motif in several classes of natural products. Our strategy entails the use of a commercially available thiol, dithiothreitol, for the covalent labeling of activated alkenes by nucleophilic 1, 4 -addition. Modification is easily discerned by comparing mass spectra of reacted and unreacted cell surface extracts. When combined with bioinformatic analysis of putative natural product gene clusters, targeted screening and isolation can be performed on a prioritized list of strains. Moreover, known compounds are easily dereplicated, effectively eliminating superfluous isolation and characterization. As a proof of principle, this labeling method was used to identify known natural products belonging to the thiopeptide, lanthipeptide, and linaridin classes.

40|$|If {{the primary}} goal of {{artificial}} reef construction is the creation of additional reef habitat that is comparable to adjacent natural rocky-reef, then performance should be evaluated using simultaneous comparisons with adjacent natural habitats. Using baited remote underwater video (BRUV) fish assemblages on purpose-built estuarine artificial reefs and adjacent natural rocky-reef and sand-flat were assessed 18 months post-deployment in three south-east Australian estuaries. Fish abundance, species richness and diversity were found to be greater on the artificial reefs than on either naturally occurring reef or sand-flat in all estuaries. Comparisons within each estuary identified significant differences in the species composition between the artificial and natural rocky-reefs. The artificial reef assemblage was dominated by sparid species including Acanthopagrus australis and Rhabdosargus sarba. The preference for a range of habitats by theses sparid species is evident by their detection on sand-flat, natural rocky reef and artificial reef habitats. The fish assemblage identified on the artificial reefs remained distinct from the adjacent rocky-reef, comprising a range of species drawn from naturally occurring rocky-reef and sand-flat. In addition, some mid-water schooling species including Trachurus novaezelandiae and Pseudocaranx georgianus were only identified on the artificial reef community; presumably as result of the reef’s isolated location in open-water.

Most of these grow adjacent to or are surrounded by other closely related species that resemble them so closely that they would ordinarily be regarded as conspecific. Specific status is accorded to them because of reproductive <b>isolation</b> <b>coupled</b> {{with at least one}} consistent difference in external morphology. This pattern recurs with sufficient constancy to suggest that the various examples have a common explanation, with similar factors operating in each instance. This pattern suggests to us a rapid shift of the adaptive mode, such as Simpson (1944) termed quantum evolution, at the diploid specific level. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to illustrate this process by a consideration of the mode of origin of a narrow serpentine endemic, Clarkia franciscana Lewis and Raven (1958)...The repeated occurrence of the same pattern of differentiation in Clarkia suggests that a rapid reorganization of chromosomes has been an important mode of evolution in the genus. This rapid reorganization of the chromosomes is comparable to the systemic mutations proposed by Goldschmidt as a mechanism of macroevolution. In Clarkia, we have not observed marked changes in physiology and pattern of development that could be described as macroevolution. Reorganization of the genomes may, however, set the stage for subsequent evolution along a very different course from that of the ancestral populations.|$|R

For most of the twentieth century, O. rufipogon held little interest for rice breeders or producers, except as a weed to be eliminated from their fields, while rice geneticists recognized it as a source of cytoplasmic male sterility, disease and insect resistance (Brar and Khush 1997; Song et al. 1995).

It advances the current knowledge base with regard to small island infrastructure effecting access to CPE, funding formal education for nurses working outside the NHS, and silo working within the community setting. Further research is required to explore the experience of community nurses under the age of 30 years not represented within this study, who will be the future workforce when older nurses retire. These findings are of particular significance to the Jersey Health and Social Services Department who are currently redesigning the future health and social care system on the island based on a community model, nurse educators, the charity and its qualified nurse employees, and finally the island population...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCirculating {{tumor cells}} (CTCs) have been {{identified}} {{with the potential to}} serve as suitable biomarkers for tumor stage and progression, but the availability of effective <b>isolation</b> technique(s) <b>coupled</b> with detailed molecular characterization have been the challenges encountered in making CTCs clinically relevant. For the first time, we combined isolation of CTCs using the ScreenCell filtration technique with quantitative analysis of CTC telomeres by TeloView. This resulted in the identification and molecular characterization of different subpopulations of CTCs in the same patient. Three-dimensional (3 D) telomeric analysis was carried out on isolated CTCs of 19 patients that consisted of four different tumor types, namely, prostate, colon, breast, melanoma, and one lung cancer cell line. With telomeric analysis of the filter-isolated CTCs, the level of chromosomal instability (CIN) of the CTCs can be determined. Our study shows that subpopulations of CTCs can be identified {{on the basis of their}} 3 D telomeric properties...|$|R
