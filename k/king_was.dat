50|$|During {{the early}} days of Christianity when lime was plentiful, four Atiuan <b>kings</b> <b>were</b> buried in tombs. There is no sign to say which <b>king</b> <b>is</b> buried here. The tomb was {{surrounded}} by a low fence of slabs of coral from the beach. However, when the <b>kings</b> <b>were</b> entombed, the place became sacred and no one was allowed to enter the fenced area. Trees and bushes were not to be disturbed. Two of the <b>kings</b> <b>were</b> entombed in Mapumai, one in Areora and one in Tengatangi.|$|R

The African-American students of Crozer for the most part conducted their social activity on Edwards Street.

5|$|After {{the revolt}} ended in 1174, {{relations}} between HenryII {{and his sons}} continued to be strained. By 1187 Henry the Young <b>King</b> <b>was</b> dead, Richard was in line to inherit, and HenryII {{was on the brink}} of war with PhilipII. In June that year Richard travelled to Paris with PhilipII and struck up a friendship with the French king. Concerned his son might turn against him, HenryII asked him to return. Richard went to Chinon and raided the castle's treasury so he could fund the repair of his own castles in Aquitaine. In 1189 Richard and Philip were wreaking havoc in Maine and Toulouse, capturing HenryII's castles; the <b>king</b> <b>was</b> ill and went to Château de Chinon. He left briefly in July to meet with Richard and PhilipII and agree a truce, and died at Chinon on 6July. The king's body was taken to Fontevraud Abbey and Richard became king.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Władysław {{gave the}} Russians the border town of Serpeysk and nearby territories, hoping {{to persuade the}} Tsar to join in an anti-Swedish alliance. However, the <b>king</b> <b>was</b> {{ultimately}} unable to overcome objections from the Polish-Lithuanian Sejm, who were unwilling to fight Sweden after the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś. The Russians, unable to see benefit in such an alliance, were also unenthusiastic, and the proposed alliance came to nothing.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Kings</b> <b>are</b> {{the first}} and most basic {{improvement}} upon the standard piece. <b>Kings</b> <b>are</b> signified by stacking two standard pieces of the original player’s color (this process is referred to as “kinging”).

5|$|Against Surrey on August 6, <b>King</b> <b>was</b> overpowering again. It {{was in this}} {{match that}} King gave what Barker called his finest {{first-class}} performance ever. Batting first, he scored 98 runs in the Philadelphian's first innings before being run out, and he then took 3 for 89 in Surrey's reply. In the second innings, he made 113 not out and then took 3 for 98. Surrey lost the match by 110 runs. Apparently, <b>King</b> <b>was</b> so exhausted after his performance that he fell asleep during a speech by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Alverstone at a banquet after the match.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were {{not out of}} the spotlight. Since the ministers were inferior to the King within the executive branch, the <b>King</b> <b>was</b> responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers were responsible for the advice given to the King when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. The <b>King</b> <b>was</b> above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried for Impeachment for advising the King to act out an unconstitutional veto. The Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, an Impeachment trial with a fairly certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E
5|$|Another change {{under the}} second and third Qajar <b>king</b> <b>was</b> the Africanization of the motif. At this time, the lion was an African lion which had a longer mane and bigger body {{compared}} to the Persian lion.

2500|$|If the pawn is on {{the third}} or fourth rank, (a) if it is a bishop pawn or central pawn, White always wins if the black <b>king</b> <b>is</b> cut off by two files for a fourth rank pawn and the black <b>king</b> <b>is</b> cut off by three files for a third rank pawn (see [...] "The Rule Of Five" [...] below) (i.e. White's rook is two files over from his pawn and the black <b>king</b> <b>is</b> on the other side), and (b) if the pawn is a knight pawn, White always wins if the black <b>king</b> <b>is</b> cut off by three files.|$|R

5|$|At Doncaster, {{the king}} awaited Montagu, {{who was in}} the north raising a {{substantial}} force in Edward's name. Edward waited; but on 29 September 1470, marching to the King, Montagu declared for Warwick. His last-minute, surprise defection from the king has been called 'decisive'. The <b>king</b> <b>was</b> trapped; disbanding his army, and with a few followers, he escaped to Bishop's Lynn, sailing for Burgundy on 2 October.|$|E
