5|$|In general relativity, no {{material}} body {{can catch up}} with or overtake a light pulse. No influence from an event A can reach any other location X before light sent out at A to X. In consequence, an exploration of all light worldlines (null geodesics) yields <b>key</b> <b>information</b> about the spacetime's causal structure. This structure can be displayed using Penrose–Carter diagrams in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk ("compactified") so as to fit onto a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard spacetime diagrams.|$|E
5|$|The Volt {{features}} OnStar Mobile {{application for}} owners to access vehicle information without being {{in or near}} the car. This smartphone application features the ability to check fuel efficiency as well as the vehicle's current electric range. It also helps monitor the charging, giving owners <b>key</b> <b>information</b> about the current charge level and the amount of time it will take until it is fully charged. The application also is able to control features such as locking/unlocking doors, and acts as a remote starter. A five-year OnStar Directions and Connections service was bundled into the 2011 Volt's base price, which was reduced to three years for the 2012 model year.|$|E
5|$|A full {{data set}} may consist of {{hundreds}} of separate images taken at different orientations of the crystal. The {{first step is to}} merge and scale these various images, that is, to identify which peaks appear in two or more images (merging) and to scale the relative images so that they have a consistent intensity scale. Optimizing the intensity scale is critical because the relative intensity of the peaks is the <b>key</b> <b>information</b> from which the structure is determined. The repetitive technique of crystallographic data collection and the often high symmetry of crystalline materials cause the diffractometer to record many symmetry-equivalent reflections multiple times. This allows calculating the symmetry-related R-factor, a reliability index based upon how similar are the measured intensities of symmetry-equivalent reflections, thus assessing the quality of the data.|$|E

By using service nodes as sacrifices, all of the three in-situ schemes can avoid the storage space wastage that is existent in all the probabilistic-based key predistribution schemes, since the <b>keying</b> <b>information</b> is only disseminated within the close neighborhood.|$|R

30|$|As {{illustrated}} in Figure 6, we also observe that SBK and LKE behave similarly, while SBK can always burden worker sensors with similar storage overhead while achieving high connectivity, which {{is attributed to}} SBK's excellent topology adaptability. In SBK, sensors differentiate their roles as either service nodes or worker nodes after deployment by probing the local connectivity of the network, and then service nodes disseminate the <b>keying</b> <b>information</b> according to the specific network connectivity. But in LKE, a deterministic procedure based on location information is conducted for role differentiation and <b>keying</b> <b>information</b> distribution.
