3000|$|Polycrystal LSMO thin <b>films</b> were {{synthesized}} <b>on</b> LaAlO 3 (100) and Si (100) {{single crystal}} substrates through spin-coating method by utilizing PACSD with PVP. XRD data shows {{evidence that the}} LSMO <b>films</b> <b>on</b> LAO is a—axis oriented and LSMO <b>films</b> <b>on</b> Si is polycrystalline, implying that the orientation of <b>films</b> depend <b>on</b> lattice mismatch degree between substrates and LSMO films. The resistance of LSMO <b>films</b> fabricated <b>on</b> LaAlO 3 substrates is smaller than that on the Si substrates. The magnetic field leads to reduced resistance of LSMO <b>films</b> both <b>on</b> LAO and Si in a wide temperature region, when the insulator-metal T MI [...] is shifted to a higher temperature. The LFMR of LSMO <b>films</b> <b>on</b> Si in low temperature range at 1 T is larger than that of LSMO <b>films</b> <b>on</b> LAO. The MR of LSMO <b>films</b> <b>on</b> LAO displays large values of MR as high as 5.17  % at room temperature. The MR of LSMO <b>films</b> <b>on</b> Si increases with decreasing temperature. The change in MR is related to GBs effect. Both films are smooth and dense with uniform nanocrystal size grain. The grain size of LSMO <b>films</b> <b>on</b> Si is larger than LSMO <b>films</b> <b>on</b> LAO. From the analysis, {{it is found that}} crystalline orientation of substrates {{plays an important role in}} affecting grain size, structure, transport properties, and the MR characterization. These results demonstrate that PACSD is a viable method for growing high quality LSMO films.|$|R

Results of the resistivity measurement of Co <b>films</b> <b>on</b> Si(111) with different state of the surface correlate with growth mechanism of the <b>films</b> <b>on</b> AES data.
