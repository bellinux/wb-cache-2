In the Act One finale ("When the Truth Comes Out"), all the plotlines come together. Dr. Kelso offers Carla her job back, but she worries <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Turk. Elliot worries <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> J.D. he's not moving in. And Ms. Miller goes in for her CT scan, which turns up a gigantic aneurysm in her temporal lobe. Dr. Cox breaks the news to Ms. Miller, pulling a curtain for privacy that also signals the end of the act.|$|E

5|$|Holmes {{had served}} under Kit Carson and John C. Fremont, {{but he was}} old and {{physically}} impaired when he met Burnham. He had lost all of his family in the Indian wars and before he died he wanted to impart {{his knowledge of the}} frontier to the young Burnham. The two men traveled throughout the American Southwest and northern Mexico, and Holmes taught him many scouting skills, such as how to track a trail, how to double and cover one's own trail, how to properly ascend and descend precipices, and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the time at night. Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such as where to find water in the desert, how to protect himself from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. A stickler for details, Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest things, such as braiding a rope, tying a knot, or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way. The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting. Burnham also worked as a cowboy, a guard for the mines, a guide, and a scout during these years.|$|E

25|$|Fallon insisted in the {{foreword}} {{that he had}} complete discretion on what {{to include}} and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> it, excluding only some private family matters. While giving great detail on some business matters, the book says almost nothing about O'Reilly's children and little of his second wife. It gives considerable detail on business matters, and does question some of O'Reilly's assertions, notably about his Irish business interests. It also gives much detail on O'Reilly's parents' situations and especially his father's family, detail which the author notes even O'Reilly did not have until the book gathered it, and includes some fine detail about his residences.|$|E
500|$|The final alleged {{stalking}} incident came {{to light}} on December 13, 2005. In the preceding days, Cho had contacted a female friend of Koch via AIM and wrote on her door board {{a line from the}} Act 2, Scene II of the Shakespeare play Romeo and Juliet. In the passage, Romeo laments to Juliet" [...] a name, I know not <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> who I am. My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, because it is an enemy to thee. Had I it written, I would tear the word." ...|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt did not {{at first}} respond to Long's claims, {{allegedly}} considering the author [...] "too small game to shoot twice." [...] He did, however, write to Burroughs that he had [...] "no quarrel with Mr. Long for the conclusions he draws from the facts. Our quarrel with him is because he invents the facts." [...] Burroughs proceeded to publicly defend the President against Long's attacks, condemning him and the expert witnesses Long produced to support his claims about the events and behaviors he depicted in his works. Newspapers around the country continuously published interviews with the two naturalists, while comedic depictions of the controversy and its participants were becoming popular with readers. One such parody referred to a non-existent book called <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> the Animals from the Wild Flowers, including an illustration which depicted an anthropomorphic [...] "Dandy Lion" [...] with a cane, top hat and monocle. This joke inspired a similarly satirical book, which was published under the title <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tell</b> the Birds from the Flowers; a collection of humorous illustrations and poems by physicist and children's author Robert Williams Wood, the work included pairings of birds and their corresponding flowers, emphasizing their visual similarities. Making a thinly veiled reference to the much publicized controversy surrounding those authors who were now called [...] "nature fakers", the book concludes: [...] "I have freely drawn upon / The works of Gray and Audubon, / Avoiding though the frequent blunders / Of those who study Nature's wonders." ...|$|E

500|$|Hemingway biographer Carlos Baker {{writes that}} Hemingway {{learned from his}} short stories how to [...] "get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to {{multiply}} intensities, and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{nothing but the truth}} in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth". The style has become known as the iceberg theory, because, as Baker describes it, in Hemingway's writing the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight. Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices to write about life in general—not only his life. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface.|$|E

He further elaborated that the goal now is to [...] "have the energy of the show get bigger as [...] goes along... We're learning <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> this version of a detective story. It's not really a police procedural. There are elements of that. But it's an incredible mish-mash of genres. I think we're getting better at finding our way through these stories." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard, Olivia called the single an [...] "empowering women's song" [...] for inspiring women to leave unfulfilling relationships. She said she wrote it: [...] "for {{all the people who}} don't know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the other person to 'bounce' [...] ". An article in Vibe magazine noted lyrics, like: [...] "I can't take this shit no more / Picture frame broken daddy 'cause I can't trust you / I'm ridin' high now / So nigga fuck you", as creating an impression of Olivia as a [...] "potty-mouth". NMEs John Mulvey commented that Olivia's [...] "ruthlessness rather than her vocabulary" [...] was the standout, especially in the lyric: [...] "Shoulda known what you missed at home / Now you're all alone with no-one to bone". Mulvey joked that the amount of censorship on the radio edit made Olivia sound [...] "avant-garde".|$|E
500|$|Because {{he began}} as a writer of short stories, Baker {{believes}} Hemingway learned to [...] "get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{nothing but the truth}} in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth." [...] Hemingway called his style the Iceberg Theory: the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in [...] "The Big Two-Hearted River") though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing {{to the extent that he}} does not have to think about anything else). [...] Paul Smith writes that Hemingway's first stories, collected as In Our Time, showed he was still experimenting with his writing style. He avoided complicated syntax. About 70 percent of the sentences are simple sentences—a childlike syntax without subordination.|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} her {{daughter}} Leopoldina of typhoid fever on 7 February 1871 devastated the small Imperial Family. PedroII decided {{on a trip to}} Europe that same year to [...] "cheer up" [...] his wife among other reasons (as stated in his own words) and to pay a visit to Leopoldina's four small boys, who had lived in Coburg with their parents since the late 1860s. The Imperial couple would travel abroad again during 1876 and 1887. Teresa Cristina preferred her ordinary life in Brazil, [...] "dedicating herself to her family, religious devotions, and charitable works." [...] In fact, visiting her native land only served to resurrect painful memories. Her family had been dethroned in 1861 and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies had been annexed to what would later become the unified Kingdom of Italy. Everyone she had known from her youth was gone. As she wrote in 1872: [...] "I do not know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> what was the impression I had upon seeing again, after 28 years, my fatherland and not to find anyone for whom I cared." ...|$|E

To this question Mars said [...] "It definitely sounds awesome. Right? Isn't that what matters? It's an awesome song! I don't know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that more". In another interview, this time for Rolling Stone, he explained that the track is about [...] "good old animalistic sex".

500|$|Jaws {{received}} mostly positive reviews upon release. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{called it}} [...] "a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works {{all the better}} because it's populated with characters {{that have been developed}} into human beings". Varietys A. D. Murphy praised Spielberg's directorial skills, and called Robert Shaw's performance [...] "absolutely magnificent". According to The New Yorkers Pauline Kael, it was [...] "the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made... more zest than an early Woody Allen picture, a lot more electricity, [...] it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way". For New Times magazine, Frank Rich wrote, [...] "Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days: this man actually knows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> a story on screen.... It speaks well of this director's gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in Jaws are those where we don't even see the shark." [...] Writing for New York magazine, Judith Crist described the film as [...] "an exhilarating adventure entertainment of the highest order" [...] and complimented its acting and [...] "extraordinary technical achievements". Rex Reed praised the [...] "nerve-frying" [...] action scenes and concluded that [...] "for the most part, Jaws is a gripping horror film that works beautifully in every department".|$|E
500|$|Several {{years before}} writing Changeling, {{television}} screenwriter and former journalist J. Michael Straczynski was contacted by a source at Los Angeles City Hall. The source {{told him that}} officials were planning to burn numerous archive documents, among them [...] "something [...] should see". The source had discovered a transcript {{of the city council}} welfare hearings concerning Collins and the aftermath of her son's disappearance. Straczynski became fascinated with the case; he carried out some research, and wrote a spec script titled The Strange Case of Christine Collins. Several studios and independent producers optioned the script, but it never found a buyer. Straczynski felt he lacked the time to devote to making the story work and only returned to the project following the cancellation of his television show Jeremiah in 2004. After 20 years as a screenwriter and producer for television, Straczynski felt he needed a break from the medium, so he spent a year researching the Collins case through archived criminal, county courthouse, city hall and city morgue records. He said he collected around 6,000 pages of documentation on Collins and the Wineville murders, before learning enough to [...] "figure out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> it". He wrote the first draft of the new script in 11 days. Straczynski's agent passed the script to producer Jim Whitaker. He forwarded it to Ron Howard, who optioned it immediately.|$|E
