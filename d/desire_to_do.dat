5|$|The {{widespread}} anxieties and consternation over government inactivity {{throughout the}} crisis could be deflected and resolved by rescuing {{a handful of}} children. In terms of recovering a sense of agency (in a conflict characterised by protestations of powerlessness by political and military authorities alike), the <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> (and be seen to do) something was expressed and assuaged by transporting and incorporating some of the need and distress into the UK where it could be tended to and made better.|$|E

5|$|At Tymshare, Engelbart {{soon found}} himself marginalized and relegated to obscurity. Operational {{concerns}} at Tymshare overrode Engelbart's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> further research. Various executives, first at Tymshare and later at McDonnell Douglas, which acquired Tymshare in 1984, {{expressed interest in}} his ideas, but never committed the funds or the people to further develop them. His interest inside of McDonnell Douglas {{was focused on the}} enormous knowledge management and IT requirements involved in the life cycle of an aerospace program, which served to strengthen Engelbart's resolve to motivate the information technology arena toward global interoperability and an open hyperdocument system. Engelbart retired from McDonnell Douglas in 1986, determined to pursue his work free from commercial pressure.|$|E

Shelby assured {{him that he had}} no <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so unless a national emergency that required his leadership emerged. Satisfied with this answer, Slaughter began his campaign.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{the band}} {{released}} its Island Records debut, The Artist in the Ambulance. The album's title is {{in reference to}} Burn Collector by Al Burian and is meant to reflect the band's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more than make music and contribute to society through their charitable donations. A portion of the album's proceeds were this time donated to the Syrentha Savio Endowment, a financial aid organization for breast cancer patients. First pressings of the album were packaged in a digipak-style case with postcards containing lyrics and notes from the band.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Manuel Azaña Díaz and Indalecio Prieto {{worked to}} unify the left and combat its extreme {{elements}} in {{what would become the}} Popular Front; this included staging of large, popular rallies,. Lerroux's Radical government collapsed after two significant scandals, including the Straperlo affair. However, president Niceto Alcalá Zamora did not allow the CEDA to form a government, and called elections. Zamora had become disenchanted with Robles's obvious <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> away with the republic and establish a corporate state, and his air of pride. He was looking to strengthen a new center party in place of the Radicals, but the election system did not favour this. Manuel Portela Valladares was thus chosen to form a caretaker government in the meantime. The Republic had, as its opponents pointed out, faced twenty-six separate government crises. Portela failed to get the required support in the parliament to rule as a majority. The government was dissolved on 4 January; the date for elections would be 16 February.|$|E

Shelby reaches out to Rachel, Puck and Quinn. She lets Puck see Beth, but rejects Quinn's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> likewise due to Quinn's bad-girl attitude, appearance and behavior. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), {{who is running for}} Congress, convinces Quinn to feature in an anti-arts video for her campaign. In it, Quinn confronts Will and blames him for her transformation into a bad girl, but Will reprimands her, reminds her of how the glee club and its members have always supported her in the past and tells her to grow up. After seeing a picture of a happy Beth and Puck, Quinn breaks down. She resumes her normal appearance, and Will and the New Directions welcome her back into the club. Puck tells Quinn he is proud of her, but Quinn reveals she is only pretending to behave in order to take Beth back from Shelby, and intends to pursue full custody.|$|E

25|$|According to E. Baldwin Smith, {{from the}} late Stone Age the {{dome-shaped}} tomb {{was used as a}} reproduction of the ancestral, god-given shelter made permanent as a venerated home of the dead. The instinctive <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this resulted in widespread domical mortuary traditions across the ancient world, from the stupas of India to the tholos tombs of Iberia. By Hellenistic and Roman times, the domical tholos had become the customary cemetery symbol.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{signing with}} Corinthians in January 2010, Roberto Carlos told TV Globo {{that he hoped}} {{to play at the}} 2010 World Cup and {{believed}} his return to Brazilian football may help him return to the national team, as manager Dunga had yet to settle on a left back. However, he was left off the 30-man provisional squad that was submitted to FIFA on 11 May 2010, along with Ronaldinho and Ronaldo. Despite his deep <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, Roberto Carlos was ultimately not named in Dunga's final squad of 23 for the Brazilian squad for the World Cup.

25|$|According to Ne-Yo, {{the idea}} for the album emerged from three influences: his <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} different instead of a standard compilation; his interest in science fiction, comic books and Japanese animation; and inspiration from the works of Michael Jackson, particularly Thriller, Moonwalker, and Bad. Originally a short movie was to accompany the album, but such proved not to be viable given time and monetary constraints, so Ne-Yo chose to develop a series of six extended music videos instead. Nevertheless, the film concept continues to influence the work, as he has stated the songs on the album are inspired by the script of the film that he wrote. The album features a number of songs which follow the story of Jerome and Pretti Sinclair.|$|E

Charlie admits to having a more adventurous spirit in his youth. He would release his breath and sink to the bottom of pools or other bodies of water until he had to rise to breathe again. Charlie liked to do this then but has no <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it now. He is content with the way things currently are in his life and does not like to be challenged.|$|E
25|$|Activity is {{preferable}} to inactivity because it facilitates well-being on multiple levels. Because of improved general health and prosperity in the older population, remaining active is more feasible now than when this theory was first proposed by Havighurst nearly six decades ago. The activity theory is applicable for a stable, post-industrial society, which offers its older members many opportunities for meaningful participation.Weakness: Some aging persons cannot maintain a middle-aged lifestyle, due to functional limitations, lack of income, or lack of a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Many older adults lack the resources to maintain active roles in society. On the flip side, some elders may insist on continuing activities in late life that pose a danger to themselves and others, such as driving at night with low visual acuity or doing maintenance work to the house while climbing with severely arthritic knees. In doing so, they are denying their limitations and engaging in unsafe behaviors.|$|E
