50|$|The ER2 {{trainset}} {{consists of}} 2-car sections, {{each of which}} includes a power car and a trailer (either a driving trailer with an <b>engineer's</b> <b>cab</b> on one end, or an intermediate trailer without an <b>engineer's</b> <b>cab).</b> Sections with a driving trailer are called head sections; those with an intermediate trailer are called intermediate sections. The sections cannot operate independently; the minimum train length is 2 head sections, and the maximum is 6 sections (2 head sections and 4 intermediate sections), with a train 5 sections long (2 head and 3 intermediate) considered standard. Coupling more than 6 sections is unsafe due to overloading of motor-generators which power the engineer's controls. The cars are coupled together with the SA3 coupler, which is standard on Soviet rolling stock and allows vertical movement of up to 100 mm.|$|R
50|$|The Comet IV cars, {{delivered}} in 1996 and purchased for NJ Transit's new Midtown Direct service, {{are similar to}} the Comet III cars, except they have no door by the <b>engineer's</b> <b>cab</b> and have thicker stripes. Metro-North's Shoreliner IV fleet are based on the same design. These cars were equipped with automatic climate control, digital displays, automated announcements and microprocessor controls.|$|R
50|$|In {{the south}} of Western Australia, Locotrol {{is used in the}} 'top-and-tail' {{configuration}} rather than specifically for long-train operation. With the recent advent of electronically controlled pneumatic brakes (ECP) - either hard-wired or radio-controlled - and integrated electronics for locomotive control and <b>engineer's</b> <b>cab</b> display systems, DP can now be provided via the ECP brake communication media, and other manufacturers are able to provide this capability.|$|R
2500|$|Immediately {{following}} the accident, Metrolink temporarily roped {{off the first}} cars in all of their trains; passengers were seated starting in the second car. Metrolink gradually modified this policy. [...] As of 2007, the line permits passengers {{to sit in a}} portion of the first car when in [...] "rear-pushed mode." [...] Seating is still not permitted in the roped-off, forward-most section of the first cars (just behind the <b>engineer's</b> <b>cab).</b>|$|R
25|$|The LIRR's {{electric}} fleet {{consists of}} 836 M7 and 170 M3 electric multiple unit cars in married pairs, meaning each car needs {{the other one}} to operate, with each car containing its own <b>engineer's</b> <b>cab.</b> The trainsets typically range up to 12 cars long. In September 2013, MTA announced that the LIRR would procure new M9 railcars from Kawasaki starting in 2016. They will replace the M3s, and expand the railroad's electric fleet.|$|R
50|$|To {{maximize}} passenger accommodation, {{almost all}} electrical equipment is mounted {{either on the}} roof (pantograph) or under the car floors (starting resistors, compressors, etc.) All underfloor equipment is enclosed in cabinets with removable spring-latched access panels {{to protect it from}} blowing dust and snow. Some of the auxiliary equipment (including some high-voltage equipment such as the electric meter) is placed in cabinets inside car vestibules. Control equipment is concentrated in the <b>engineer's</b> <b>cab.</b> Numerous changes were made during the production run (see below), which caused variations in equipment layout.|$|R

50|$|The ER2 {{electric}} trainset is a DC electric {{multiple unit}} {{which was in}} production by the Railroad Machinery Plants of Riga (in consortium with the Electrical Machinery Plants of Riga and the Railroad Machinery Plants of Kalinin) from June 1962 to mid-1984. It was essentially an improvement of the ER1 design, featuring footboards for low platforms, and aprons for high platforms, as well as improved electrical equipment and {{minor changes to the}} bodywork (specifically, the <b>engineer's</b> <b>cab,</b> side walls, headstocks, and door mountings). Since the mid-1960s, the ER2 has been the most widely used type of suburban train in the Soviet Union and its successor states.|$|R
25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1920s, the PRR {{installed}} Pulse code cab signaling along certain tracks used by high-speed passenger trains. Information traveled through the rails using track circuits, {{was picked up by}} a sensor on the locomotive, and displayed in the <b>engineer's</b> <b>cab.</b> PRR ultimately installed cab signals on its New York-Washington, Philadelphia-Pittsburgh, and Pittsburgh-Indianapolis lines (the latter which was later downgraded by PC and ultimately abandoned by Conrail). PRR also experimented with cab signals without wayside signals, an approach later expanded by Conrail (Conemaugh line) and Norfolk Southern Railway (Cleveland line). Cab signals were subsequently adopted by several other U.S. railroads, especially on passenger lines. This technology, advanced for its time, is still used by Amtrak.|$|R

50|$|The Hudson, Harlem and New Haven {{lines and}} the New Canaan branch and all {{passenger}} rolling stock is equipped with cab signalling, which displays the appropriate block signal in the <b>engineer’s</b> <b>cab.</b> All rolling stock is equipped with Automatic Train Control (ATC), which enforces the speed dictated by the cab signal by a penalty brake application should the engineer fail to obey it. There are no intermediate wayside signals between interlockings: operation is solely by cab signal. Wayside signals remain at interlockings. These are a special type of signal, a go or a stop signal. They do not convey information about traffic in the blocks ahead - the cab signal conveys block information.|$|R

50|$|The total {{production}} {{run for the}} ER2 numbered 850 complete trainsets; of these, 629 were built with 10 cars each, 134 with 12 cars, 75 with 8 cars, 7 with 6 cars and 5 with 4 cars each. Unlike the ER1, the cars in the ER2 trainsets were not permanently coupled, which allowed their length to be adjusted according to traffic levels. To facilitate this, from 1964-1970 and from 1981-1984 the Kalinin and Riga plants produced 133 separate driving trailers (to allow the splitting of trainsets into shorter sections); in 1967-68, the Riga plant produced 52 separate power cars {{to go with the}} driving trailers; from 1967 onward, 173 intermediate 2-car sections were produced (to lengthen trainsets as needed); from 1973 onward, 58 head-end 2-car sections (with an <b>engineer's</b> <b>cab)</b> were produced; and in 1980, 4 intermediate trailers were built. Production of the ER2 trainsets was ended in September 1984, the Riga Railroad Machinery Plant switching to production of the improved ER2R and ER2T trainsets (basically ER2s, but fitted with rheostatic braking).|$|R
5000|$|The Pacific Surfliner uses a {{fleet of}} [...] "Surfliner" [...] bi-level, {{high-capacity}} passenger cars owned by Amtrak (AMTK) and the California Department of Transportation (CDTX). Each trainset has a business class car, three coach cars, a coach/café car with food sales on the lower level, and a coach/baggage/cab car equipped with coach seating, a checked baggage space on the lower level, and <b>engineer's</b> operating <b>cab</b> and headlights on one end, allowing the train to be operated in push-pull mode.|$|R
50|$|As on the ER1, the ER2 car {{bodies are}} of a welded {{all-metal}} semi-monocoque load-bearing design (the entire car body bears all structural loads). The framework is built up from bent and extruded steel profiles, and consists of ring frames which are covered with corrugated sheet steel 1.5-2.5 mm thick. The automatic couplers and their shock absorbers are mounted on short spine beams {{at each end of}} the car. The doors and wire conduits are made of aluminum, which helped to keep the weight down and resulted in the cars being only slightly heavier than those of the ER1. Footboards are fitted under the outside of each door for boarding and alighting to/from low platforms; when boarding/alighting passengers to/from high platforms, these are covered by metal aprons (gap fillers). The end bulkheads of each car (except for the head end of the driving trailer, which is occupied by the <b>engineer's</b> <b>cab)</b> incorporate swing-down transfer platforms which allow passengers to walk between cars; these also damp the cars' pitching motion when the train is moving. The cars are 19.600 m long and 3480 mm wide. The power cars weigh 54.6 t, the driving trailers 40.9 t, and the intermediate trailers 38.3 t.|$|R
50|$|Surfliner {{cars were}} {{delivered}} in several types: coach cars, café/coach cars equipped for food sales {{on the lower}} level, business-class cars which have two small galleys to allow an attendant to offer complimentary beverage service, and coach/baggage/cab cars equipped with coach seating, a checked baggage space on the lower level, and <b>engineer's</b> operating <b>cab</b> and headlights on one end, allowing the train to be operated in push-pull mode. All Surfliner cars are equipped with overhead luggage racks, reclining seats with tray tables and footrests, reading lights, restrooms, AmtrakConnect WiFi, 120v power outlets, and a wheelchair ramp. The Surfliner has a maximum speed of 90 mph.|$|R
5000|$|The San Joaquin is {{equipped}} with Amtrak California's fleet of [...] "California Car" [...] bi-level, high-capacity passenger cars owned by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). Each trainset typically consists of two coach cars, a coach/baggage car, a café (dining) car, and a cab/coach car. The cab/coach car is a similar to other coaches but with an <b>engineer's</b> operating <b>cab</b> and headlights on one end, allowing the train to be operated in push-pull mode, which eliminates the need to turn the train at each end-point. Caltrans {{is in the process}} of refitting the cab/coach cars to have a space on car's lower level for storage for checked luggage and bikes.|$|R
5000|$|Like many American {{films of}} the time, Wolves of the Rail was subject to cuts by city and state film {{censorship}} boards.

5000|$|Distributed Power {{should not}} be {{confused}} with Multiple Unit operation, which is a capability generally found on all locomotives owned and operated by railroads that connect multiple locomotives directly together via MU cables and air brake control lines. MU operation in North America is designed so that any two locomotives so-equipped and regardless of age and manufacturer, can be coupled together and operated as a single locomotive by one <b>engineer</b> in the <b>cab</b> of the [...] "lead" [...] unit. This is accomplished via 27-pin MU cable and the connection of three additional air lines separate from the [...] "train line" [...] or [...] "brake pipe". DP is an entirely separate system using radio links to control locomotives separated from the lead unit(s) by at least one rail car and therefore impossible to connect via MU.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{development}} of a network of wireless ultralow-power sensors to be deployed on freight railway cars, with the main purpose of detecting derailment events and alerting the <b>engineer</b> in the <b>cab</b> of the leading locomotive. Because no power bus is available on freight cars, we plan to rely on energy scavenging from vibrations; therefore, minimization of the power consumption has been one of our main priorities. We have, therefore, focused on ultralow-power hardware and strived to reduce the time intervals during which it is in active mode, achieving an average power consumption of ~ 0. 5 mW with an active cycle of ~ 20 ms every 2 s. We discuss the overall concept that we propose, including the self-initialization protocol and the communication strategy that we have developed, and present the results of measurements on a prototype network that we have implemented...|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, remote control {{locomotives}} were increasingly popular on North American railroads for switching duties in rail yards. This system allows the conductor to directly control the locomotive(s) via a wireless remote unit, {{as opposed to}} radioing commands to an <b>engineer</b> in the <b>cab.</b> Some Class I Rail Yards utilize RCO packs for their conductors, while others do not, {{depending on the size}} and type of Yard. Class I Railroads train conductors on the use of RCO packs with classroom and hands-on instruction, culminating with on-the-job training and certification as a RCO operator. Currently, Class I railroads such as Norfolk Southern require RCO qualified conductors to work from job boards that perform RCO operations exclusively (when in a yard that utilizes RCO switching). This ensures the extra training and pay these conductors receive will provide the company with maximum value for the investment.|$|R

40|$|The severe {{economic}} difficulties, increased {{poverty and the}} political instability that have plagued many African countries {{in the last two}} decades have resulted in the large scale migration of Africans Europe and the United States. Unlike their counterparts in the 1960 s and 70 s who were anxious to return home after acquiring an American education in order to contribute in the task of nation building, an overwhelming majority of recent immigrants are more interested in establishing permanent residency in the United States. Although these immigrants continue to be attracted to major cities like New York, Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles, they can also be found in increasing numbers in small and mid-sized cities in Ohio, Nebraska, Iowa and Maine. To experience the sights, sound and flavors of Africa without leaving Minnesota, just step into a Somali mini-mall in Minneapolis or an African shopping center in St. Paul. There are the sweet, pungent smells of Somali dishes, the vivid colors of African clothing, and the rapid fire, foreign language conversations of Somalis, Ethiopians, and Liberians who moved to the states at a record pace during the past decade.
