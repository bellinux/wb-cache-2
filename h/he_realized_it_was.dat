5|$|About {{ten minutes}} after the surrender, Pritchard heard rapid gunfire to the north. He left Davis and the {{captured}} men {{in the hands of}} his 21-year-old adjutant. Once he had approached the gunfire, <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the 4th Michigan and the 1st Wisconsin shooting at each other with Spencer repeating carbines, neither realizing who they were shooting at. Pritchard immediately ordered his men to stop and shouted to the 1st Wisconsin to identify the parties. In the five-minute skirmish, the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry had suffered eight men wounded, while the 4th Michigan Cavalry had lost two men killed and one wounded.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} and social activity was disrupted in the village: widows {{had to take the}} jobs of their husbands; because of their lack of knowledge in the cultivation of land, harvested very little corn and beans. There were diseases, especially among children and the elderly, there was no food or clothing. The teacher of the village came only part-time, mostly out of fear, but left after <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not worth to stay because young people had to work. Nor could they spend money on travel. The village had no teacher for the next four years. The events generated finally the breakup of the community. Some village women though that their husbands were killed because of three others who were linked with the guerrillas and were involved in a land dispute.|$|E
25|$|First {{trying to}} examine the hole with a {{flashlight}} from above Gómez could see only darkness, so tied with a line of heavy rope around his waist he was lowered by several colleagues, and descending into the murk <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a perfectly cylindrical shaft. At the bottom he came to rest in apparently ancient construction – a man-made tunnel, blocked in both directions by immense stones. Gómez was acquainted that archaeologists had previously discovered a narrow tunnel underneath the Pyramid of the Sun, and supposed he was now observing a kind of similar mirror tunnel, leading to a subterranean chamber beneath Temple of the Feathered Serpent. He decided initially to elaborate clear hypothesis and to obtain approval. Meanwhile, he erected a tent over the sinkhole to preserve it from {{the hundreds of thousands}} of tourists who visit Teotihuacán. Researchers reported that the tunnel was believed to have been sealed in 200 CE.|$|E
500|$|After {{seeing the}} initial {{proposal}} for [...] "What Are Little Girls Made Of?", Barrett {{felt that she}} could play the woman who went into space to find her fiance. She dyed her hair blonde {{in an attempt to}} fit the role. Barrett sought to surprise Roddenberry at his office, but he walked right past her, not recognizing who she was. It was only when he came back out give his secretary some papers that <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Barrett. They had the idea that it might get her past the NBC executives and back onto the show. The character of Christine Ducheaux was subsequently changed to Christine Chapel by Roddenberry, as a play on the Sistine Chapel. No other actresses were considered for the role.|$|E

500|$|The D-Day {{scenes were}} shot in Ballinesker Beach, Curracloe Strand, Ballinesker, {{just east of}} Curracloe, County Wexford, Ireland. Hanks {{recalled}} to Roger Ebert that although <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a movie, the experience still hit him hard, stating, [...] "The first day of shooting the D-Day sequences, I {{was in the back}} of the landing craft, and that ramp went down and I saw the first 1-2-3-4 rows of guys just getting blown to bits. In my head, of course, I knew it was special effects, but I still wasn't prepared for how tactile it was." [...] Filming began June 27, 1997, and lasted for two months. Some shooting was done in Normandy, for the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer and Calvados. Other scenes were filmed in England, such as a former British Aerospace factory in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, Thame Park, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. Production was due to also take place in Seaham, County Durham, but government restrictions disallowed this.|$|E
500|$|While {{the final}} version of [...] "Part Two" [...] is quite enclosed, the initial script was {{considered}} epic, with production designer Jerry Wanek jokingly referring to it as a [...] "six-hour mini-series". In the original version, the giant devil's trap keeping demons away from the gateway to Hell was much more complex, with each point in the pentagram being a church housing a holy relic—such as a sliver from the True Cross. With the artifacts powering the devil's trap, Jake's role would have been to go to each church and destroy them, the hunters following after him to try to stop him. Jake would then eventually destroy the final relic during a fight with Sam, and Dean would race to the gateway to prevent Azazel from opening it while Jake and Sam are [...] "beating the crap out of each other". However, when director and executive producer Kim Manners received the script, <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> huge, and had the storyboard artist make five-and-a-half hours of storyboards for the episode to prove that it could not be filmed without going {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} over-budget. Production suggested that a large amount of money could be saved by not depicting the churches, which were major set pieces for the intended story. Kripke realized that instead of using churches, he could have the points of the pentagram be connected by railroad tracks. With tracks being made of iron, it fit perfectly with the series mythology because iron is a demon deterrent. Kripke found this aspect to be more Western, matching the tone of show. Rather than destroying the devil's trap as in the original script, Jake is instead sent by Azazel to open the gateway himself, and the major fight scene between Jake and Sam was then changed into a standoff between Jake and the hunters. Though the storyline had to be toned down, Kripke felt that this improved the overall episode by making it simpler.|$|E

After doing some street racing, <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too {{dangerous}} and started drag racing at a track. He won the first event that he entered in the C/Gas category. His Chevy was nicknamed [...] "Hang 'Em High" [...] because his wheelstands scraped the car's bumper. His next car was a big block 1957 Chevy nicknamed [...] "Rat Poison". He drove a series of doorslammers and appeared to be a Pro Stock driver, but then he decided to start racing the faster funny cars.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1999, bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. bought houses in the South of France, {{in order to be}} near Bono and The Edge's homes so they could have a place to both [...] "work and play". That year, a bag holding {{personal}} papers and a laptop computer containing lyrics for the album was taken from Bono's car, which was parked outside Dublin's Clarence Hotel, which is owned by Bono and The Edge. Bono offered a reward of £2,000 for the return of the computer. An Irish man returned the laptop after having bought it for £300 thinking it was from a reputable source. <b>He</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Bono's when he saw a picture of the singer's child Elijah Bob on the screen, prompting him to contact U2's management.|$|E
2500|$|At one point, The Long Good Friday director, John Mackenzie, {{was linked}} with the film. When Carlito's Way and its sequel After Hours were optioned, Martin Bregman had Abel Ferrara in mind. However, when Bregman and Ferrara parted ways, De Palma was brought in. Bregman {{explained}} that this decision was not about [...] "getting the old team back together", rather than making use of the best talent available. De Palma, reluctantly, read the script {{and as soon as}} Spanish-speaking characters cropped up he feared it would be Scarface all over again. He said {{that he did not want}} to make another Spanish-speaking gangster movie. When De Palma finally did read it all the way through, <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not what he thought it was. De Palma liked the script and envisioned it as a noir movie. Bregman supervised casting throughout the various stages of pre-production, and carefully selected the creative team who would make the film a reality. This included production designer Richard Sylbert, editor Bill Pankow, costume designer Aude Bronson-Howard and director of photography Stephen Burum.|$|E

2500|$|In earlier {{versions}} of Jackson's script, Sauron does indeed [...] "come forth" [...] at Aragorn's challenge, and does battle with him: The extra materials published together with the extended DVD version of the third movie indicate as much. Scenes of the fight were shot, but later this idea was discarded {{and was replaced by}} a scene (in the extended version) where Aragorn kills the [...] "Mouth of Sauron" [...] (a representative of Sauron) before fighting a Mordor troll. In fact, the footage of the battle with the troll was the same footage of Aragorn fighting Sauron, with the CGI troll mapped over a painted-out Sauron, as seen in the DVD special features. In this abandoned scene, when Sauron first emerges from the Black Gate, he appears in his fair and seductive form as [...] "Annatar the Lord of Gifts", trying to entice Aragorn and the other leaders with offers of peace and dominion. [...] When they reject him, he reverts to his true form, as seen in the prologue. [...] Jackson said he removed the scene when <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too much of a departure from the source material and thematically missed the point: the battle {{was supposed to be a}} selfless sacrifice by Aragorn and his army, and making it into a duel between Aragorn and Sauron made it more about personal glory.|$|E
60|$|THE {{night was}} clear and hot when Appleby sat with Harper in the Café Salamanca looking out upon the plaza at Santa Marta. The big room was open‐fronted, and only divided from the {{pavement}} by a row of wooden pillars and a balustrade. It was also, as usual, crowded with citizens who assembled there in the evening to discuss politics and {{the progress of the}} campaign, which accounted for the fact that Appleby sat quietly in a corner with a little glass of wine {{on the table in front}} of him. <b>He</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> highly desirable that he should obtain some insight into what was going on, for there was then a growing distrust of American imperialism which was perhaps not altogether unwarranted among the Cuban loyalists. Aliens were being watched with a jealous eye, and Appleby, who had already had difficulties with the petty officials, was aware that there was little the Administration contemplated that was not known in the cafés. Most men of Iberian extraction are apt at intrigue, and since the journals for excellent reasons usually maintained a discreet reticence popular discontent and factional bitterness found another vent.|$|E
60|$|In {{reply to}} the soft and far from {{unpleasant}} modulations of the other's voice, Tarzan spoke in various tribal dialects of the interior {{as well as in}} the language of the great apes, but it was evident that the man understood none of these. Seeing that they could not make each other understood, the pithecanthropus advanced toward Tarzan and placing his left hand over his own heart laid the palm of his right hand over the heart of the ape-man. To the latter the action appeared as a form of friendly greeting and, being versed in the ways of uncivilized races, he responded in kind as <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> doubtless intended that he should. His action seemed to satisfy and please his new-found acquaintance, who immediately fell to talking again and finally, with his head tipped back, sniffed the air in the direction of the tree above them and then suddenly pointing toward the carcass of Bara, the deer, he touched his stomach in a sign language which even the densest might interpret. With a wave of his hand Tarzan invited his guest to partake of the remains of his savage repast, and the other, leaping nimbly as a little monkey to the lower branches of the tree, made his way quickly to the flesh, assisted always by his long, strong sinuous tail.|$|E

60|$|Though {{exceedingly}} tired, he was yet {{loath to}} yield to lassitude, but this night it was not from listening, watchful vigilance; it was from a desire to realize his position. The details of his wild environment seemed the only substance of a strange dream. He saw the darkening rims, the gray oval turning black, the undulating surface of forest, like a rippling lake, and the spear-pointed spruces. He heard the flutter of aspen leaves and the soft, continuous splash of falling water. The melancholy note of a canyon bird broke clear and lonely from the high cliffs. Venters had no name for this night singer, {{and he had never}} seen one, but the few notes, always pealing out just at darkness, were as familiar to him as the canyon silence. Then they ceased, and the rustle of leaves and the murmur of water hushed in a growing sound that Venters fancied was not of earth. Neither had he a name for this, only it was inexpressibly wild and sweet. The thought came that it might be a moan of the girl in her last outcry of life, and he felt a tremor shake him. But no! This sound was not human, though it was like despair. He began to doubt his sensitive perceptions, to believe that he half-dreamed what he thought he heard. Then the sound swelled with the strengthening of the breeze, and <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the singing of the wind in the cliffs.|$|E
