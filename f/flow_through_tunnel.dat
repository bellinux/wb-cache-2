50|$|The Kawartha lakes of Ontario {{formed in}} the Late Wisconsinan glacial period.

50|$|The {{stratification}} of {{the lake}} is caused by conditions which prevent or restrict the mixing of water vertically. These conditions include:1. The lake is surrounded by rock walls and trees which substantially block the wind flow across the lake that would cause mixing.2. The primary water sources for the lake (rain, runoff and tidal <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> <b>tunnels)</b> are all close to the surface.3. The lake is in the tropics where seasonal temperature variation is small, and so the temperature inversion that can cause vertical mixing of lakes in temperate zones does not occur.|$|R

50|$|Under {{the third}} stage of construction, works were carried out on the closure of {{diversion}} channel and construction of the dam in that portion while the river was made to <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> diversion <b>tunnels.</b> The remaining portion of upstream blanket and the main dam at higher levels was also completed as part of stage 3 works, which were concluded in 1976.|$|R
5000|$|To {{the north}} of the summit is a small lake, Marchlyn Mawr, which is the upper {{reservoir}} for Dinorwig power station, a pump-storage power station hidden inside the mountain.

From the north, Elidir Fawr is very prominent, and can appear to be higher than the higher mountains behind it.|$|R
50|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was obliged}} to release ten million gallons a day. To ensure this, a gauging basin 40 feet in diameter was built. The drinking water <b>flowed</b> <b>through</b> the Mottram <b>Tunnel</b> to the Godley covered reservoir.|$|R

50|$|The Belmeken (Bulgarian: Белмекен) dam is {{situated}} in the Rila Mountains and is the highest dam lake on the Balkan peninsula. There is a pumped-storage plant built on the lake (PSP) (ПАВЕЦ).

Part of the water used in the PSP is returned by its pumps, while the rest is sent <b>through</b> <b>tunnels</b> in the Sestriomo WPP (Water Power Plant).

25|$|Reasonable {{progress}} was made from {{the eastern end of}} the tunnel once the TBM had been reassembled there in April 1972. Though the wear on the machine caused by its use at the western end caused some mechanical problems, progress of up to 15 m per 8 hour shift was achieved, though this was considerably reduced in wet areas. With up to 600 m³ of water <b>flowing</b> <b>through</b> the <b>tunnel</b> walls, continuous pumping was required to avoid flooding.|$|R
50|$|Dot and Tot of Merryland is a 1901 {{novel by}} L. Frank Baum.

The book was illustrated by artist W. W. Denslow, who had illustrated three previous Baum books.|$|R
25|$|Much of {{the water}} <b>flowing</b> <b>through</b> the Moffat <b>Tunnel</b> to Denver {{actually}} crosses the Continental Divide three times.

25|$|With {{the tunnel}} cleared, it was resurfaced and {{modified}} {{to accommodate the}} force of a river instead of a railroad. Until this time, the Sacramento had still been <b>flowing</b> <b>through</b> the middle of the dam site, between the two nearly completed abutments of the dam. An earth/rock filled cofferdam was constructed across the river, which now began to <b>flow</b> <b>through</b> the <b>tunnel,</b> drying out the dam site and enabling work to begin on the middle section of the dam, which contained the spillway bays. The spillways with their 18 high-pressure river outlet valves and massive triple drum gates were completed in the summer of 1943. By then, a total of 15 million tons of concrete had been used in the dam's construction, comprising the 16,900 50-foot blocks.|$|R

500|$|The Howard Prairie Delivery Canal was {{completed}} in 1959, along with Keene Creek Reservoir, Cascade Tunnel, and Greensprings Tunnel.

50|$|The Rea {{rises in}} Waseley Hills Country Park, with the source well signposted {{from the car}} park there. The river drops about 70 m in its first mile, but from then on has a very gentle slope. The river's tributaries include Callow Brook, the Bourne (which begins as Merritts Brook before joining Griffins Brook) and Bourne Brook. From Rubery, the river flows into Birmingham near the former Rover works at Longbridge, then <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> a <b>tunnel</b> under the A38. In Northfield, one of the river's few {{remaining}} fords is at The Mill Walk, near Hawkesley Mill Lane. After this, the river valley is also used by the railway to Kings Norton.|$|R
50|$|The {{river is}} known for its {{challenging}} Class III and IV rapids. Both guided and solo whitewater rafting and kayaking tours are popular, with thousands of people making the trip each season. One of the Middle Fork's most notable features is Tunnel Chute, where the river <b>flows</b> <b>through</b> a <b>tunnel</b> blasted <b>through</b> a ridge during the California Gold Rush in order to allow gold mining in the adjacent riverbed. The Middle Fork is a heavily dam-controlled river and {{during the height of the}} summer rafting season, flows are highly dependent on electric power demand in the Sacramento area. However, this also guarantees steady flows in the river during dry years.|$|R
