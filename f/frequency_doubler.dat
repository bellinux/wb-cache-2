The inherent square-law nonlinearity of the voltage-to-force transfer function of a cantilever resonator’s capacitive transducer can be employed for the realization of frequency doubling effect. Due to the low-loss attribute (or equivalently, a high Q) offered by MEMS devices, improved circuit performance can be expected from a micromechanical <b>frequency</b> <b>doubler</b> than semiconductor devices utilized for the same task.|$|E

5000|$|The Nd:YVO4 {{or other}} Nd-doped crystal is coated on the diode {{side with a}} {{dielectric}} mirror that reflects at 808 nm and transmits at 1064 nm. The crystal is mounted on a copper block, acting as a heat sink; its 1064 nm output is fed into a crystal of potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP), mounted on a heat sink in the laser cavity resonator. The orientation of the crystals must be matched, as they are both anisotropic and the Nd:YVO4 outputs polarized light. This unit acts as a <b>frequency</b> <b>doubler</b> and halves the wavelength to the desired 532 nm. The resonant cavity is terminated by a dielectric mirror that reflects at 1064 nm and transmits at 532 nm. An infrared filter behind the mirror removes IR radiation from the output beam (this may be omitted or inadequate in less-expensive [...] "pointer-style" [...] green lasers), and the assembly ends in a collimator lens.|$|E
50|$|Lasers {{emitting}} a violet {{light beam}} at 405 nm may be constructed with GaN (gallium nitride) semiconductors. This {{is close to}} ultraviolet, bordering on the very extreme of human vision, and can cause bright blue fluorescence, and thus a blue rather than violet spot, on many white surfaces, including white clothing, white paper, and projection screens, due to {{the widespread use of}} optical brighteners in the manufacture of products intended to appear brilliantly white. On ordinary non-fluorescent materials, and also on fog or dust, the color appears as a shade of deep violet that cannot be reproduced on monitors and print. A GaN laser emits 405 nm directly without a <b>frequency</b> <b>doubler,</b> eliminating the possibility of accidental dangerous infrared emission. These laser diodes are mass-produced for the reading and writing of data in Blu-ray drives (although the light emitted by the diodes is not blue, but distinctly violet). , 405 nm blue-violet laser diode modules with an optical power of 250 mW, based on GaN violet laser diodes made for Blu-ray disc readers, had reached the market from Chinese sources for prices of about US$60 including delivery.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, an {{impedance}} matching network synthesis technique for designing an active <b>frequency</b> <b>doubler</b> is proposed. A single-ended MESFET <b>frequency</b> <b>doubler</b> circuit is first constructed {{to determine a}} set of ideal terminating impedances for the maximum conversion gain with minimum unwanted-output harmonics. The complex conjugation of those ideal impedances {{is equivalent to the}} internal input and output impedances of the FET at different harmonics. As a result, the microstrip matching networks can be easily designed to match with the input and output impedances of the nonlinear device by conventional network synthesis. To validate this design technique, a single-ended FET 1. 2 / 2. 4 GHz <b>frequency</b> <b>doubler</b> for ISM band is demonstrated. The measured performances of fabricated circuit conform to the simulated results and exhibit 7. 8 dB conversion gain and 75 MHz operating bandwidth as well as unwanted-output harmonics suppression better than 20 dB...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{modified}} time-delay microwave <b>frequency</b> <b>doubler</b> is proposed. A voltage controlled delay line (VCDL) {{in the proposed}} <b>frequency</b> <b>doubler</b> compensates the time-delay mismatching between input and delayed signal. With the delay matching and waveform shaping using adjustable Schmitt triggers, the unwanted fundamental component (f 0) and the higher order harmonics such as third and fourth are diminished excellently. In result, only the doubled frequency component (2 f 0) appears dominantly at the output port. The <b>frequency</b> <b>doubler</b> is designed at 1. 15 GHz of f 0 and fabricated with TSMC 0. 18 mum CMOS process. The measured output power of 2 f 0 is 2. 67 dBm when the input power is 0 dBm.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} cataract on <b>frequency</b> <b>doubling</b> perimetry in the screening mode. METHODS: <b>Frequency</b> <b>doubling</b> technology perimetry in the C- 20 - 5 screening mode was performed prospectively on 34 patients with otherwise healthy eyes before and after phacoemulsification. Cataracts were scored using the LOCS III classification, and the number of missed points (at any level of severity) on the screening field was compared before and after surgery. RESULTS: Nine patients missed at least one point pre-operatively and had no misses post-operatively. Those patients with posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataract {{were significantly more likely to}} miss points on the screening <b>frequency</b> <b>doubling</b> technology perimetry than those without posterior subcapsular cataracts (P < 0. 001; Fisher exact test). In addition, the degree of posterior subcapsular cataract strongly correlated with the number of missed points pre-operatively (r = 0. 97). The degree of nuclear sclerotic cataract did not correlate strongly with the number of missed points (r = 0. 26), but the correlation was slightly stronger in the presence of cortical cataract (r = 0. 36). CONCLUSION: Advanced age-related cataracts may cause false positive results on the screening <b>frequency</b> <b>doubling</b> technology, and the presence of even mild posterior subcapsular cataract may be a cause of false positive results and should be taken into consideration when interpreting the screening <b>frequency</b> <b>doubling</b> technology perimetry results.
