40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this report is to {{identify}} and resolve some of the flammable gas and thermal safety issues potentially associated with the retrieval of waste from Tank 241 -AN- 105 (AN- 105), {{which is the first}} double-shell tank scheduled for waste retrieval at Hanford. The planned retrieval scenario includes the following steps in AN- 105 : (1) degas the tank using two submerged mixing pumps, (2) turn off the mixer pump(s) and allow any suspended solids to settle, (3) <b>decant</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> to the intermediate feed staging tank(s) (IFSTs) (AP- 102 and/or AP- 104) using water/caustic dilution at the transfer pump inlet, (4) add the remaining dilution water/caustic to the slurry remaining in AN- 105, (5) mix the tank with the mixer pump(s) until the soluble solids dissolve, (6) turn off the mixer pump(s) and let the insoluble solids settle, and (7) decant the new supernatant to the IFST(s), leaving the insoluble solids behind. Three waste retrieval safety issues are addressed in this report. They are (1) the controlled degassing of AN- 105 to ensure that the headspace remains < 25 % of the lower flammability limit (LFL), (2) an assessment of how dissolved gas (mainly ammonia) released during the transfer of the supernatant in AN- 105 to the IFSTs and the water/caustic dilution of the remaining slurry in AN- 105 will affect the flammability in these tanks; and (3) an assessment of the maximum waste temperatures that might occur in AN- 105 during retrieval operations...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Phosphate esters {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in any organism. Nucleic acids, metabolic intermediates like glucose- 6 -phosphate, energy-rich substrates (AMP, creatine phosphate) are some obvious examples. While many metabolic intermediates are activated through {{the transfer of}} phosphate groups (e. g., by kinases) it is equally important that phosphate esters can also be rapidly broken down. The hydrolytic removal of phosphate groups from phosphoesters is catalyzed by phosphatases. Many phosphatases are highly substrate-specific, like those enzymes involved in signal transduction. A number of phosphatases, however, cleave virtually any phosphate ester. Such unspecific enzymes function mainly in the catabolic breakdown of metabolites or nutrients. Depending on the pH at which such phosphatases have optimal activity, we distinguish between acidic phosphatases (also called acid phosphatases) and alkaline phosphatases. The latter enzymes require divalent metal ions as cofactors and are common in animal tissues and bacteria. Acidic phosphatases are widely distributed in many organisms, including plants. They work optimally at ~ pH 5 without additional cofactors. The enzymes are classified as E. C. 3. 1. 3. 2. In this experiment, we will extract an acidic phosphatase from seedlings of mustard (Sinapis alba) and partially purifiy the enzyme by ammonium sulfate precipiation. Most important prerequisite for any enzyme isolation is an activity test. For this phosphatase, we {{take advantage of the}} broad substrate specificity and use an artificial substrate that changes its color after hydrolytic removal of the phosphate group: ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") Since the phosphatase is active only at acidic pH values, but p-nitrophenol is colored at basic pH values, we must change the pH following the enzyme reaction. We will incubate for 30 min at pH 4. 8, and then stop the reaction by adding NaOH. ### EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL **Week 1 - Day 1 ** You are provided with a flat of 5 - 8 days old mustard seedlings grown in the dark in a bed of vermiculite. ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") 1.

Some qualitative estimation methods of terpenoids in plant tissue have been previously described {{but there is no}} protocol of estimating the same quantitatively till date. In the present study a protocol has been attempted to estimate the total terpenoids concentration of different resin producing plants using a monoterpene, Linalool as standard reagent. ### Introduction Terpenes and terpenoids are the primary {{constituents of}} the essential oils of many types of plants and flowers. These compounds belong to the isoprenoid group. Even though isoprene itself has not been found in nature, its polymers, terpenic hydrocarbons and their oxygen derivatives are very often present in large quantities in different plant species. The resin produced by most plants is a viscous liquid, composed mainly of volatile fluid terpene 3. The single isoprene unit, therefore, represents the most basic class of terpenes, the hemiterpenes. An isoprene unit bound to a second isoprene is the defining characteristic of terpene, which is also a monoterpene (C 10). Sesquiterpenes contain three isoprene units (C 15), while diterpenes (C 20) and triterpenes (C 30) contain two and three terpene units respectively. Tetraterpenes consist of four terpene units, polyterpenes more than four such units. In nature, terpenes occur predominantly in the form of hydrocarbons, alcohols and their glycosides, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters. Apart from broad structural diversity, terpenes also exhibit a wide array of biological actions. Essential oils have antimicrobial, antiparasitic, insecticidal and antioxidant/prooxidant activities that often represent the combined bioactivity of multiple components 10. Many plant terpenoids are cytotoxic towards tumour cells and are applied as chemotherapeutic or chemo-preventive compounds 1, 2. Terpenes play an important role as signal compounds and growth regulators (phytohormones) of plants 10. Many insects metabolize the terpenes which they may have obtained from their plant food for synthesizing growth hormones and pheromones 10. Many plant and insect resins like Lac resin also have economically beneficial properties, useful for varnishes and adhesives 4. This protocol describes a rapid, small-scale, high-throughput assay for approximating the total terpenoids content in plant tissue using a monoterpene, Linalool as standard reagent with conc. sulfuric acid. In this reaction Geraniol (primary alcohol, C 10 H 18 O) may be produced from Linalool (Tertiary alcohol, C 10 H 18 O). Alpha-terpineol (C 10 H 18 O) or such monocyclic terpenoids may further be produced from geraniole 3. It is very obscured to explain the exact chemical nature of the reaction in where a brick red precipitation has been formed and which is partially soluble in reaction mixture solution and chloroform but fully in methanol. All estimation has been done spectroscopically at 538 nm. ### Reagents 1. Methanol (Sigma, Cat. No. M 3641) - Sulfuric Acid (Sigma, Cat. No. 320501) - Chloroform (Sigma, Cat. No. C 2432) - Linalool (Sigma, Cat. No. L 2602) ### Equipment 1. Colorimeter - Mixer mill disrupter with adaptor sets for 2 ml tubes (Qiagen tissue lyser) or Mortar & pestle. ### Procedure 1. Harvest plant material (approximately 500 mg.) in screw-capped tubes & freeze immediately in liquid Nitrogen. [Sample must be stored at - 80 ⁰ C for 1 - 2 months but fresh sample must be preferred] - To homogenize the tissue, place three tungsten Carbide beads & 3. 5 ml of ice-cold 95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol in each sample tube & insert sample into pre-cooled teflon adaptors. Homogenized tissue for 5 minutes at 30 Hz. If a mixture mill is not available tissue can be homogenized in an ice-cold mortar & pestle. - Remove tungsten carbide beads with a magnet & incubate the sample at room temperature for 48 h in dark. - Centrifuge the samples (4000 g for 15 min. at room temperature) & collect the supernatant in a fresh 2 ml micro-tube. - Add 1. 5 ml Chloroform in each 2 ml microcentrifuge tube & then add 200 µl sample supernatant in each. REMARK For the standard curve 200 µl of previously prepared Linalool solution in methanol will be added to 1. 5 ml Chloroform & serial dilution must be done[dilution level- 100 mg/ 200 µl to 1 mg/ 200 µl (12. 965 µM- 1. 296 µM) Linalool Conc. In case of serial dilution total volume of 200 µl will be make up by addition of 95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol]. - Vortex the sample mixture thoroughly & take the time 3 min to rest. - Add 100 µl Conc. Sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) to each 2 ml microcentrifuge tube. - CRITICAL STEP If heat generation occurs then the entire system must be cooled by using ice-pad but not more than 15 min. - Then the assay tube must be incubated at room temperature for 1. 5 h- 2 h in dark. - PAUSE POINT For standard solution (Linalool) incubate not more than 5 minutes and during incubation time the microcentrifuge tube must not be disturbed. - At the end of incubation time a reddish brown precipitation will be formed in each assay microcentrifuge tube. Then carefully & gently decant all supernatant reaction mixture liquid with-out disturbing the precipitation. - CRITICAL STEP The reddish brown precipitation is partially soluble in reaction mixture solution so must gently <b>decant</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> fluid. - Add 1. 5 ml of 95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol & vortex thoroughly until all the precipitation dissolve in Methanol completely. - Transfer the sample from assay tube to Colorimetric cuvette [95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol will be used as blank] to read the absorbance at 538 nm. Total Terpenoid Calculation 12. Calculate a standard curve from the blank-corrected at wave length at 538 nm of the Linalool standard (Fig. 1). Calculate total terpenoids concentration of unknown plant sample as Linalool equivalents using the regression equation of Linalool standard curve. ### Troubleshooting Terpenoids content varies considerably among leaf and bark tissue and also with environmental and biological stress 8, 11. In the design of this experiment we advise the use of multiple biological and technical replicates, in order to minimize the sample errors (Table 1). Different incubation time should be tried with each plant species and tissue to optimize the assay. Automated liquid handling system may also significantly increase throughput and improve results 6. Most probably sulfuric acid rearranged the linalool and the tertiary alcoholic group reduces to primary alcohol for which the solubility of reaction product has been reduced to chloroform. It is very important to note that sulfuric acid not only reacts to terpenoids but also it may react with methanolic extract of plant tissue samples having plant phenolics and alkaloids. ### Anticipated Results Some qualitative estimation methods of terpenoids in plant tissues have been previously described and widely used 9. The quantitative analytical colorimetric method of total terpenoids concentration in plants as suggested in this protocol can be used to estimate the total terpenoids of different resin producing plants. ### References 1.

40|$|The {{homogeneous}} {{and stable}} dispersion of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in solvents {{is often a}} prerequisite for their use in advanced materials. Dispersion procedures, reagent concentration {{as well as the}} interactions among reagent, defective CNTs and near-perfect CNTs will affect the resulting CNT dispersion properties. This study, for the first time, presents a detailed comparison between two different approaches for dispersing CNTs. The results enhance our understanding of the interactions between surfactant, defective CNTs and near-perfect CNTs and thus provide insight into the mechanism of CNT dispersion. Dispersions of &# 8220;as-produced&# 8221; short multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in N,N-dimethylformamide were prepared by two different surfactant (Triton X- 100) assisted methods: ultrasonication and ultrasonication followed by centrifugation, <b>decanting</b> <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> and redispersing <b>the</b> precipitate. Visual observation and UV&# 8211;visible spectroscopy results showed that the latter method produce a more stable dispersion with higher MWCNT content compared to dispersions produced by ultrasonication alone. Transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopic investigations revealed that the centrifugation/decanting step removed highly defective nanotubes, amorphous carbon and excess surfactant from the readily re-dispersible near-perfect CNT precipitate. This is contrary to other published findings where the dispersed MWCNTs were found in <b>the</b> <b>supernatant.</b> Thermogravimetric analysis showed that 95 % of Triton X- 100 was removed by centrifugation/decanting step, and the remainder of the Triton X- 100 molecules is likely randomly adsorbed onto the MWCNT surface.

We previously reported a method for isolating DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes by precipitation with spermine (1). This procedure proved less effective with other tissues, especially lung, and the spermine precipitates often took several days to dissolve in buffer.

40|$|A 3 -L sludge slurry {{sample from}} Tank 12 was {{characterized}} and then processed through an aluminum dissolution demonstration. The dominant constituent of the sludge {{was found to}} be aluminum in the form of boehmite. The iron content was minor, about one-tenth that of the aluminum. The salt content of <b>the</b> <b>supernatant</b> was relatively high, with a sodium concentration of {approx} 7 M. Due to these characteristics, the yield stress and plastic viscosity of the unprocessed slurry were relatively high (19 Pa and 27 cP), and the settling rate of the sludge was relatively low ({approx} 20 % settling over a two and a half week period). Prior to performing aluminum dissolution, plutonium and gadolinium were added to the slurry to simulate receipt of plutonium waste from H-Canyon. Aluminum dissolution was performed over a 26 day period at a temperature of 65 C. Approximately 60 % of the insoluble aluminum dissolved during the demonstration, with the rate of dissolution slowing significantly {{by the end of the}} demonstration period. In contrast, approximately 20 % of the plutonium and less than 1 % of the gadolinium partitioned to the liquid phase. However, about a third of the liquid phase plutonium became solubilized prior to the dissolution period, when the H-Canyon plutonium/gadolinium simulant was added to the Tank 12 slurry. Quantification of iron dissolution was less clear, but appeared to be on the order of 1 % based on the majority of data (a minor portion of the data suggested iron dissolution could be as high as 10 %). The yield stress of the post-dissolution slurry (2. 5 Pa) was an order of magnitude lower than the initial slurry, due most likely to the reduced insoluble solids content caused by aluminum dissolution. In contrast, the plastic viscosity remained unchanged (27 cP). The settling rate of the post-dissolution slurry was higher than the initial slurry, but still relatively low compared to settling of typical high iron content/low salt content sludges. Approximately 40 % of the post-dissolution sludge settled over a three week period. The corresponding volume of supernatant that was <b>decanted</b> from <b>the</b> waste was approximately 35 % of the total waste volume. <b>The</b> <b>decanted</b> <b>supernatant</b> contained approximately one-third of the dissolved aluminum and exhibited a mild greenish-grey hue...|$|R
