5|$|The {{story begins}} in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby {{for a woman who}} has been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a {{caesarian}} operation on the woman with a <b>jack-knife</b> because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to hold her down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth and death, and thinks to himself that he will never die, as he watches his father row.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Rollover and <b>jack-knifing</b> of tractor {{semitrailer}} on {{high speed}} obstacle avoidance under emergency are serious threats for motorists. A tractor semitrailer model was built with multi-rigid-body method in this paper. The steering performance of tractor semitrailer has been analyzed, {{as well as the}} stability control theory, including yaw rate following, anti-rollover. The dynamics simulation for yaw rate following and anti-rollover has been performed on the dynamic tractor semitrailer. The results show that the vehicle dynamics control proposed in this paper can stabilize the tractor semitrailer, rollover and <b>jack-knifing</b> are prevented and the tractor semitrailer more accurately follows the driver's desired path...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Tractor semitrailers on {{high speed}} {{obstacle}} avoidance under emergency are likely to arise rollover or <b>jack-knifing,</b> which are serious risks for motorists. A dynamic stability analysis model of a three-axle tractor semitrailer vehicle is developed using the application tool. The linearized vehicle model is utilized to predict the dynamics state of the tractor semitrailer built in multibody dynamics simulation software. The lateral stability simulation for yaw rate following and anti-rollover has been performed on the dynamic model based on virtual prototyping. The {{results show that the}} lateral stability control based on tractor semitrailer proposed in this paper can stabilize the tractor semitrailer, rollover and <b>jack-knifing</b> can be prevented to a large extent...|$|R

40|$|Rollover and <b>jack-knifing</b> of {{articulated}} heavy {{trucks are}} serious threats for motorists. Active safety technologies {{have been demonstrated}} to have potential to reduce or prevent the occurrence {{of these types of}} accidents. The Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC) system utilizes differential braking to affect vehicle response and {{has been shown to be}} quite effective in controlling vehicle yaw response. In this paper, a VDC system that improves yaw, lateral, and roll stability is presented. The objectives of this VDC design are to prevent or reduce the likelihood of rollover and <b>jack-knifing</b> and to make the vehicle more closely follow the driver's intended path. A linear root locus study is performed to tune controller gains in a systematic fashion. Nonlinear dynamics simulations of a generic articulated heavy truck are run with the TruckSim and Matlab/Simulink software to study the performance of the proposed VDC algorithm. Human-in-the-loop driver models are used to obtain realistic steering inputs on predetermined test track. The simulation results of maneuvers utilizing these driver models, as well as maneuvers utilizing prescribed steering inputs, are presented. VDC is shown to stabilize the vehicle, rollover and <b>jack-knifing</b> are prevented and the vehicle more accurately follows the driver's intended path. 1...|$|R
