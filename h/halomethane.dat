5|$|A {{number of}} gaseous or highly {{volatile}} brominated <b>halomethane</b> compounds are non-toxic and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same mechanism, and are particular effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines, airplanes, and spacecraft. However, they are expensive and their production and use {{has been greatly}} curtailed due to their effect as ozone-depleting agents. They are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers, but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications. They include bromochloromethane (Halon 1011, CH2BrCl), bromochlorodifluoromethane (Halon 1211, CBrClF2), and bromotrifluoromethane (Halon 1301, CBrF3).|$|E

25|$|Tetrafluoromethane, {{also known}} as carbon tetrafluoride, is the {{simplest}} fluorocarbon (CF4). It has a very high bond strength {{due to the nature}} of the carbon–fluorine bond. It can also be classified as a haloalkane or <b>halomethane.</b> Because of the multiple carbon–fluorine bonds, and the high electronegativity of fluorine, the carbon in tetrafluoromethane has a significant positive partial charge which strengthens and shortens the four carbon–fluorine bonds by providing additional ionic character. Tetrafluoromethane is a potent greenhouse gas.|$|E
3000|$|Guo et al. (2009) {{reported}} that gamma radiation induces removal of four <b>halomethanes</b> in drinking water. The {{results showed that}} absorbed dose and solution pH were important factors to remove <b>halomethanes.</b> The reactions of <b>halomethanes</b> with e_aq^ - [...] {{play a crucial role}} in their removal processes. <b>Halomethanes</b> removal during the radiation followed a pseudo-first-order kinetics model.|$|R
50|$|Like methane itself, <b>halomethanes</b> are {{tetrahedral}} molecules. The halogen atoms differ {{greatly in}} size and charge from hydrogen and from each other. Consequently, the various <b>halomethanes</b> deviate from the perfect tetrahedral symmetry of methane.|$|R
50|$|The {{physical}} properties of <b>halomethanes</b> {{depend on the}} number and identity of the halogen atoms in the compound. In general, <b>halomethanes</b> are volatile but less so than methane because of the polarizability of the halides. The polarizability of the halides and the polarity of the molecules makes them useful as solvents. The <b>halomethanes</b> are far less flammable than methane. Broadly speaking, reactivity of the compounds is greatest for the iodides and lowest for the fluorides.|$|R
25|$|In {{the carbon}} {{tetrachloride}} molecule, four chlorine atoms are positioned symmetrically as corners in a tetrahedral configuration joined {{to a central}} carbon atom by single covalent bonds. Because of this symmetrical geometry, CCl4 is non-polar. Methane gas has the same structure, making carbon tetrachloride a <b>halomethane.</b> As a solvent, it is well suited to dissolving other non-polar compounds, fats, and oils. It can also dissolve iodine. It is somewhat volatile, giving off vapors with a smell characteristic of other chlorinated solvents, somewhat similar to the tetrachloroethylene smell reminiscent of dry cleaners' shops.|$|E
2500|$|The haloalkanes (also {{known as}} halogenoalkanes or alkyl halides) are {{a group of}} {{chemical}} compounds derived from alkanes containing one or more halogens. They are {{a subset of the}} general class of halocarbons, although the distinction is not often made. Haloalkanes are widely used commercially and, consequently, are known under many chemical and commercial names. They are used as flame retardants, fire extinguishants, refrigerants, propellants, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. Subsequent to the widespread use in commerce, many halocarbons have also been shown to be serious pollutants and toxins. For example, the chlorofluorocarbons have been shown to lead to ozone depletion. Methyl bromide is a controversial fumigant. Only haloalkanes which contain chlorine, bromine, and iodine are a threat to the ozone layer, but fluorinated volatile haloalkanes in theory may have activity as greenhouse gases. Methyl iodide, a naturally occurring substance, however, does not have ozone-depleting properties and the United States Environmental Protection Agency has designated the compound a non-ozone layer depleter.

30|$|<b>Halomethanes</b> {{are often}} found in {{mixtures}} at hazardous waste sites. DHM- 1 was effective in transforming mixtures of CT, CFC- 11 and CF. Consistent with general expectations for <b>halomethanes</b> (Wackett et al. [1992]), CT was transformed first, followed by CFC- 11 and then CF. The inhibitory effect of CFC- 11 on CF is a potential concern, since the average rate of CFC- 11 transformation by DHM- 1 was approximately 40 -fold slower than CF.|$|R
2500|$|Very pure {{forms of}} butane, {{especially}} isobutane, {{can be used}} as refrigerants and have largely replaced the ozone-layer-depleting <b>halomethanes,</b> for instance in household refrigerators and freezers. The system operating pressure for butane is lower than for the <b>halomethanes,</b> such as R-12, so R-12 systems such as in automotive air conditioning systems, when converted to pure butane will not function optimally and therefore a mix of isobutane and propane is used to give cooling system performance comparable to R-12.|$|R

50|$|The <b>halomethanes</b> are {{produced}} {{on a massive}} scale from abundant precursors, i.e. natural gas or methanol, and from halogens or halides. They are usually prepared by one of three methods.|$|R
50|$|Alongside hydrogen, carbon {{can form}} {{compounds}} with the chemically similar halogens, forming haloalkanes. The simplest of this series, the <b>halomethanes,</b> contain compounds such as dichloromethane and iodoform. Other such important chemicals include vinyl chloride, {{which is used}} in the production of PVC.|$|R
50|$|Biomass {{also has}} the {{potential}} to be converted to multiple commodity chemicals. <b>Halomethanes</b> have successfully been by produced using a combination of A. fermentans and engineered S. cerevisiae. This method converts NaX salts and unprocessed biomass such as switchgrass, sugarcane, corn stover, or poplar into <b>halomethanes.</b> S-adenosylmethionine which is naturally occurring in S. cerevisiae allows a methyl group to be transferred. Production levels of 150 mg L-1H-1 iodomethane were achieved. At these levels roughly 173000 L of capacity would need to be operated just to replace the United States’ need for iodomethane. However, an advantage of this method is that it uses NaI rather than I2; NaI is significantly less hazardous than I2. This method may be applied to produce ethylene in the future.|$|R

30|$|The {{effect of}} DHM- 1 {{inoculum}} concentration on the CF biodegradation rate was evaluated using 10 treatments. Half of the treatments received varying inoculum levels of DHM- 1; the others consisted of abiotic controls. Treatments were prepared {{in the same}} manner described in the section for transformation of individual <b>halomethanes,</b> with an initial CF addition of approximately 500  mg/L (without [14 C]CF).|$|R
30|$|For {{contaminant}} plumes {{with high}} concentrations of <b>halomethanes</b> that are not undergoing natural attenuation, the options for bioremediation are limited. The benefits of using a culture such as DHM- 1 include its high rate of CF transformation; its ability to transform mixtures of CT, CF, and CFC- 11; the conversion of these <b>halomethanes</b> to environmentally benign products; its growth on an inexpensive primary substrate (corn syrup); {{and its ability to}} grow in the presence of CF at levels at least as high as 4000  mg/L. The culture also retains its ability to anaerobically transform CF after exposure to air for as long as one day (Additional file 1 : Figure S 3). Further studies are needed to validate the use of DHM- 1 under field conditions, and to determine if lower cost formulations of B 12 can be developed, e.g., using the fermentation product from cultures that synthesize B 12 with a lesser degree of purification.|$|R
