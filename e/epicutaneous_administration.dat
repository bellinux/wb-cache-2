40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was test the anti-inflammatory efficacy of diclofenac dietilamine, applied epicutaneously at a dose rate of 0. 44 mg kg - 1, in a model of acute arthritis in horses. Four clinical end-points, as well as two biochemical markers, were used as surrogate markers of the required clinical response (analgesia, anti-inflammatory). Low diclofenac concentrations were measured in blood (C max 0. 04 ± 0. 03 ug mL - 1) and synovial fluid (C max 0. 08 ± 0. 08 ug mL - 1) from the first to the last sampling time. The statistical comparison of the clinical end-points and biochemical markers between placebo and dicilofenac treated group indicated a lack of pharmacological effect of this compound after <b>epicutaneous</b> <b>administration...</b>|$|E
40|$|The epicutaneous {{application}} of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in localized rheumatic diseases {{results in a}} highly targeted antiinflammatory action and is associated with reduced systemic effects. The new diclofenac epolamine (DHEP) salt is much more soluble both In water and In lipid solvent than other diclofenac salts. The pharmaceutical addition of lecithin to DHEP leads {{to the formation of}} mixed micelles with high affinity to the cellular component, which guarantees the absorption of the active ingredient. We performed a bioavailability randomized, cross-over study to compare the plasma profiles of diclofenamic acid after repeated <b>epicutaneous</b> <b>administration</b> of the new topical formulation with those of the marketed DHEP formulation without lecithin. Based on a randomization list, 12 healthy volunteers were asked to apply one of the two formulations twice a day for 10 consecutive days. The other formulation was given after a washout period of 1 week. Blood samples were collected before the morning epiculaneous dose on days 1, 3, 5 and 8 of treatment and on day 10 at different sampling times until 24 h after the application. The pharmacokinetic analysis showed a significantly higher plasma concentration of diclofenamic acid after the {{application of}} DHEP lecithin, which indicates a better saturation of the subcutaneous tissues underlying the application site. This also indicates increased local availability of the active principle. In conclusion, the new DHEP formulation with lecithin should have a therapeutic advantage compared with the formulation without lecithin, even in cases of short- to medium-term treatments...|$|E
40|$|The skin {{accommodates}} multiple {{dendritic cell}} (DC) subsets with remarkable functional diversity. Immune reactions are initiated and modulated by the triggering of DC by pathogen-associated or endogenous danger signals. In contrast to these processes, {{the influence of}} intrinsic features of protein antigens on the strength and type of immune responses is much less understood. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of distinct DC subsets in immune reactions against two structurally different model antigens, E. coli beta-galactosidase (betaGal) and chicken ovalbumin (OVA) under otherwise identical conditions. After <b>epicutaneous</b> <b>administration</b> of the respective DNA vaccines with a gene gun, wild type mice induced robust immune responses against both antigens. However, ablation of langerin+ DC almost abolished IgG 1 and cytotoxic T lymphocytes against betaGal but enhanced T cell and antibody responses against OVA. We identified epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) as the subset responsible for the suppression of anti-OVA reactions and found regulatory T cells critically involved in this process. In contrast, reactions against betaGal were not affected by the selective elimination of LC, indicating that this antigen required a different langerin+ DC subset. The opposing findings obtained with OVA and betaGal vaccines were not due to immune-modulating activities of either the plasmid DNA or the antigen gene products, nor did the differential cellular localization, size or dose of the two proteins account for the opposite effects. Thus, skin-borne protein antigens may be differentially handled by distinct DC subsets, and, in this way, intrinsic features of the antigen can participate in immune modulation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Epicutaneous</b> {{allergen}} <b>administration</b> using a patch may be {{an alternative}} to subcutaneous or sublingual immunotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To optimize treatment dose and to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of epicutaneous immunotherapy. METHODS: This monocentric, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial included 132 patients with grass pollen-induced rhinoconjunctivitis. In February 2008, patients were randomly allocated to receive placebo or 3 different doses of allergen. Before and during the pollen season 2008, patients received 6 weekly patches. Efficacy was assessed 4 to 5 months later (n = 110) and during the pollen season of the treatment-free follow-up year in 2009 (n = 93). The primary outcome was patient-reported changes in hay fever symptoms assessed by a visual analog scale. Secondary outcome measures were weekly visual analog scale symptom scores during pollen season, use of rescue medication, changes in conjunctival and skin reactivity, as well as safety. RESULTS: Hay fever symptoms during the pollen season were reduced by more than 30...|$|R
40|$|Skin is {{protected}} by a tough but flexible multilayered barrier and is a front line for immune responses against invading particles. For many years now, skin has been a tissue where certain vaccines are injected {{for the prevention of}} infectious disease, however, the detailed mechanisms of the skin immune response are not yet well understood. Using thin and small injection needles, we carefully injected OVA into a restricted region of mouse skin, i. e., intradermal (ID), and examined the antibody response in comparison with subcutaneous (SC) injection or <b>epicutaneous</b> patch <b>administration</b> of OVA. <b>Epicutaneous</b> patches induced a high IgE response against OVA, but IgG production was low. High IgG production was induced by both ID and SC injection, moreover, ID injection induced higher IgG production without any adjutants. Furthermore, OVA-specific IgE production was diminished by ID injection. We found that ID injection could efficiently stimulate skin resident DCs, drive Th 1 -biased conditions and diminish IgE production. The ID injection response was regulated by Langerin+ dermal DCs, because OVA was taken up mainly by these cells and, after transiently deleting them, the IgE response was no longer diminished and IgG 1 production was enhanced. We also tested whether ID injection might be an effective allergy treatment by attempting to inhibit ongoing IgE production in mice with experimentally induced high serum IgE levels. Multiple ID injections of OVA were shown to prevent elevation of serum OVA-specific IgE after repeated allergen challenge. In contrast, SC OVA injection could only transiently inhibit the OVA-specific IgE production. These findings indicated that ID injection results in higher induction of antigen-specific IgG, and thus may be useful for vaccine delivery with little or no adjuvant components. Moreover, the observed diminishment of IgE and induction of Th 1 -biased immune responses suggest that ID may be a useful injection route for allergy immunotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Food allergy is an {{increasingly}} prevalent problem {{all over the}} world and especially in westernized countries, and there is an unmet medical need for an effective form of therapy. During childhood natural tolerance development is frequent, but some children with cow's milk or hen's egg allergy and the majority of children with peanut allergy will remain allergic until adulthood, limiting not only the diet of patients but also their quality of life. Within the last several years, the usefulness of immunotherapy for food allergies has been investigated in food allergic patients. Several food immunotherapies are being developed; these involve oral, sublingual, <b>epicutaneous,</b> or subcutaneous <b>administration</b> of small amounts of native or modified allergens to induce immune tolerance. The approach generally follows the same principles as immunotherapy of other allergic disorders and involves administering small increasing doses of food during an induction phase followed by a maintenance phase with regular intake of a maximum tolerated amount of food. Oral immunotherapy seems to be a promising approach for food allergic patients based on results from small uncontrolled and controlled studies. Diet containing heated milk and egg may represent an alternative approach to oral immunomodulation for cow's milk and egg allergic subjects. However, oral food immunotherapy remains an investigational treatment to be further studied before advancing into clinical practice. Additional bigger, multicentric and hopefully randomized-controlled studies must answer multiple questions including optimal dose, ideal duration of immunotherapy, degree of protection, efficacy for different ages, severity and type of food allergy responsive to treatment. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers...|$|R
40|$|Background: Epicutaneous {{sensitization}} to allergens {{is important}} in the pathogenesis of not only skin inflammation such as atopic dermatitis but also "atopic march" in allergic diseases such as asthma and food allergies. We here examined antibody production and skin barrier dysfunction in mice epicutaneously administered papain, a plant-derived occupational allergen belonging to the same family of cysteine proteases as mite major group 1 allergens. Methods: Papain and Staphylococcus aureus V 8 protease were patched on the backs of hairless mice. Tran- sepidermal water loss was measured to evaluate the skin barrier dysfunction caused by the proteases. Papain or that treated with an irreversible inhibitor specific to cysteine proteases, E 64, was painted onto the ear lobes of mice of an inbred strain C 57 BL/ 6. Serum total IgE levels and papain-specific IgE and IgG antibodies were measured by ELISA. Results: Papain and V 8 protease patched on the backs of hairless mice caused skin barrier dysfunction and increased serum total IgE levels, and papain induced the production of papain-specific IgG 1, IgG 2 a, and IgG 2 b. Papain painted onto the ear lobes of C 57 BL/ 6 mice induced papain-specific IgE, IgG 1, IgG 2 c, and IgG 2 b, whereas papain treated with E 64 did not. IgG 1 was the most significantly induced papain-specific IgG subclass among those measured. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the <b>epicutaneous</b> <b>administration</b> of protease not only disrupted skin barrier function, but also induced IgE and IgG responses in a manner dependent on its protease activity. These results suggest that protease activity contained in environmental sources contributes to sensitization through an epicutaneous route...|$|E
