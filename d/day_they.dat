Using American Time Use Surveys, we find caregivers spend less time on personal care, social activities/sports, and more on housework, than individuals who do not provide any eldercare.

In addition, caregivers may not provide care every day, but on <b>days</b> <b>they</b> do, they also {{spend more time on}} housework and less on paid work, and report higher levels of sadness than on <b>days</b> <b>they</b> do not provide care. Regular caregivers experience worse well-being than non-caregivers, but also experience additional strain on <b>days</b> <b>they</b> provide care...|$|R

Powder-down is produced by specialised feathers in the lumbar region and distributed by the preening cockatoo all over the plumage.|$|E
