Provided the world interest rate [...] is given, the model predicts the domestic rate will become {{the same level of}} the world rate by arbitrage in money markets. However, in reality, the world interest rate is different from the domestic rate. Rüdiger Dornbusch considered how exchange rate expectations made an effect on the exchange rate. Given the approximate formula:and if the <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>expectations</b> , is less than unity, then we haveSince domestic output is , the differentiation of income with regard to the exchange rate becomesThe standard IS-LM theory gives us the following basic relations:Investment and consumption increase as the interest rates decrease, and currency depreciation improves the trade balance.Then the total differentiations of trade balance and the demand for money are derived.and then, it turns out thatThe denominator is positive, and the numerator is positive or negative. Thus, a monetary expansion, in the short run, does not necessarily improve the trade balance. This result is not compatible with what the Mundell-Fleming predicts. This is a consequence of introducing exchange rate expectations which the MF theory ignores. Nevertheless, Dornbusch concludes that monetary policy is still effective even if it worsens a trade balance, because a monetary expansion pushes down interest rates and encourages spending. He adds that, in the short run, fiscal policy works because it raises interest rates and the velocity of money.|$|E

They maintain that monetary policy would be neutral only if, and insofar as, there were proportional changes in the quantity of the two types of money. According to the author, however, {{there appears to be no}} justification for maintaining that the distinction implies a new condition for the achievement of neutrality, and least of all should it be assumed that it destroys the usefulness of the neutrality of money theorem.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop and test a model for the monetary sector of the Egyptian economy. It explores the importance of the instruments of monetary policy and the ability of the Central Bank of Egypt to control the supply of money. The model incorporates the preferences of the public for different types of liquid financial assets and all the financial assets and liabilities of the commercial banks and monetary authorities. With respect to the demand side of the model, it explores the classical quantity theory of Fisher, Marshall and Pigon, the Keynesian and the monetarists' demand theories for money. It explores the importance of wealth, current income, permanent income, interest rates, inflation and expected inflation. The argument by Friedman, that permanent income is the appropriate scale variable, is not supported empirically with respect to developing economies. Empirical work on developing economies suggests that transitory income may be held in cash balances due to the limited availability of alternative liquid assets. Also, non-static expectations with respect to the rate of inflation does not seem to be relevant to annual models for developing economies. Empirical results indicate that the <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>expectation</b> is not significantly different from unity. With respect to the supply side of the model, this paper explores the multiplier, the production function and the "residual" approaches to the determination of money supply. Whether a supply function exists or not remains an open question. Empirical evidence indicates that the relationships between money supply, free reserves and total reserves are unstable. The non-linear hypothesis and the production function approaches state essentially an equilibrium condition. Determination of money supply as a residual from the balance sheets of the banking sector is void of the essential drawbacks of the multiplier approach. The model provides estimates for borrowings, excess reserves, foreign assets and loans. The empirical results indicate that the Central Bank of Egypt lacks the ability to control the supply of money, essentially due to lack of control over government and commerical banks' borrowings. Results for the demand function indicate that monetary policy could be relatively effective in influencing the real sector. However, lack of control over money supply implies this effectiveness cannot be channeled in the right direction. It also implies that the monetary authorities cannot control inflation under the present practices. Development of the securities market seems to be imperative to control inflation...|$|R
40|$|This paper clarifies why a {{transaction}} tax, {{such as the}} Tobin Tax, can stabilize financial markets. In markets that are already fairly deep, relatively small changes in trading volume are unlikely to have any impact (positive or negative) on volatility. Thus, a Tobin Tax can potentially have a stabilizing effect on international currency markets not because it reduces the excessive volume of transactions of speculators, but because it can slow down {{the speed with which}} market traders react to changes in prices of currencies. Moreover, it can lower their <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> future price <b>expectations</b> with respect to current price changes, which also has a stabilizing effect. Thus, to the extent that a Tobin Tax causes traders in financial markets to delay their decisions, a few 'grains of sand in the wheels of international finance' can indeed be stabilizing. Whether or not that is sufficient to prevent speculative attacks on currencies is a different matter. ...|$|R

The model is fit for the period prior {{to the beginning of}} area rate regulation of the wellhead price of natural gas. The theory of joint costs and the effects of dissimilar inventories of undrilled gas and oil prospects are used to explain the pattern of signs and magnitudes of the coefficients derived.

The simulated discoveries are uniformly higher than the actual observed discoveries. A possible explanation of this result is the effect of regulation and changes in regulatory policies upon the <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>expectations</b> for gas prices, and a rigorous statement of the relation is developed.

40|$|In {{the post}} war era, {{much has been}} said {{about the role of the}} foreign trade sector in {{affecting}} the rate and the level of domestic economic growth in the group of LDCs. The impact of exports in particular received the lion's share of attention. It has been frequently argued that exports act as an engine of growth. The line of causation here runs from exports to domestic economic growth. Through the effects of both the multiplier and the accelerator, output expands by a multiple of the initial value of exports. Exportation also tends to reduce the opportunity cost of domestic resources by providing foreign exchange necessary to meet domestic demands from abroad at relatively lower prices. Forward and backward linkages stimulate growth in export-related activities. Export expansion, in addition, gives rise to external economies, economies of scale, an efficient allocation of resources, and a greater-than-one <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> <b>expectations</b> on the part of domestic exporters. Thus, we set out in this note to measure the labour absorptive capacity of exports and import substitution in Egypt.
