One of which is based on curvature measurements while the other utilises inclination measurements from successfully developed FBG tilt sensors. A series of simulation tests of a full-scale bridge was conducted.

A static loading beam test with increasing loads at the mid-span and a beam test with different loading locations were conducted to measure vertical displacements using FBG strain sensors and tilt sensors.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of local and frequently updated information about adverse weather and road conditions on driver behaviour. The information was transmitted by several types of variable message signs (VMS). Two evaluations investigated the effects of VMS systems involving an individual sign or two signs; two other evaluations focused on more extensive VMS systems involving several signs, and two evaluations studied {{the effects of the}} sign technology. The slippery road condition sign and minimum headway sign decreased the mean speed of cars travelling in free-flow traffic by 1 - 2  km/h. The minimum headway sign also decreased the proportion of short headways. In addition, drivers' reports suggested that these variable message signs have other effects on driver behaviour, such as the refocusing of attention to seek cues on potential hazards, testing the slipperiness of the road, and more careful passing behaviour. Lowering the speed limit from 100  km/h to 80  km/h on a weather-controlled road decreased the mean speed by an average of 3. 4  km/h in winter. The system proved most effective when adverse weather and road conditions were not easy to detect. The system also decreased the standard deviation of speed. Most drivers accepted lowered speed limits and found variable speed limits useful. Variable speed limit signs using <b>fibre-optic</b> <b>technology</b> were found to be more effective than electromechanical signs. However, effective signs may divert the driver's attention from adjacent fixed signing.

40|$|A novel meso reactor {{based on}} oscillatory flow {{technology}} (Harvey et al., 2001) has been recently presented in Harvey et al. (2003) {{as a new}} technology for reaction engineering and particle suspension applications. Due to the demonstrated enhanced performances for fluid micro mixing and suspension of catalyst beads and to the small volume of the reactor, this novel miniature reactor is suitable for applications at specialist chemical manufacture and high throughput screening. Furthermore, a high control of environment conditions (e. g. mixing intensity, temperature) coupled with an online monitoring turns this reactor suitable for smallscale applications to the bioengineering field, such as for fast parallel bioprocessing tasks. This work concerns with the fluid dynamics characterisation of a novel miniature reactor. Experimental results using state-of-art <b>fibre-optic</b> <b>technology</b> is used in order to demonstrate that an accurate control of the residence time distribution (RTD) of liquid and solid phases can be achieved within this reactor as well as enhanced (oxygen) mass transfer rates. Furthermore, numerical simulations using Fluent ® software will be presented where simulated RTDs agrees with the experimental results. The meso reactor unit consists of 4. 4 mm internal diameter and 35 cm long jacketed glass tubes, with a unit volume of 4. 5 ml and provided with smooth periodic constrictions (SPCs), with an average baffle spacing of 13 mm. The internal diameter at the constricted zone (baffle internal diameter) is 1. 6 mm, leading to a reduction of the baffle free are of 87 %. This unit is able to support batch or continuous operations mode, simply by configuring the tubes in parallel or in series, according to the intended application. Mixing is achieved by oscillating the fluid at the bottom or {{the top of the}} reactor by means of a piston pump, using oscillation amplitudes and frequencies ranging from 0 to 4 mm centre-to-peak and 0 to 25 Hz, respectively. Experimental studies using the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique (Harvey et al., 2003) showed that different fluid mechanics are originated at different oscillation conditions (oscillation amplitudes and frequencies). A plug flow or a stirred tank behaviour can be obtained just by controlling the oscillation conditions. At low oscillatory Reynolds numbers (Reo), e. g. 10 to 100, the formation of axisymmetric eddies detached from the constrictions is coupled with low axial velocities and makes it possible to continuously operate the reactor in a plug flow mode. Increasing the Reo to values higher than 100, the eddy symmetry is broken and a complete mixing state is achieved inside the meso reactor. Low oscillation amplitudes must be used if axial dispersion is intended to be minimized, namely at plug flow setup. Through an overall oscillation cycle, changes of the location of the main flow stream from near the wall to the centre of each cavity and vice-versa was observed and is expected to lead to high mass and heat transfer rates (Perry, 2002). Due to the observed high radial velocities, narrow residence times distributions are expected to be obtained (Perry, 2002). Also high axial circulation rates were also observed at high Reos (above 100) and it was proved to lead to an enhanced performance on catalyst beads suspension. The relation of this fluid mechanics with the real performance of this novel meso reactor will be demonstrated. Tracer injection technique is applied to perform RTD studies inside a single SPC tube of the meso reactor. Spectroscopy UV/VIS technique is used to measure the concentration of a coloured tracer at the inlet and outlet (at continuous mode) or at the bottom and the top of the tube (at batch mode). A fibre optic apparatus is employed in order to obtain highly accurate online measurements of the UV/VIS absorbance. Mixing times are calculated for experiments at batch mode. Different flow rates are used to determine the effect of the flow rate over the RTD at continuous operation and axial dispersion is presented by the Bodenstein number, Bo. Determination of KL. a values is achieved by online measurement of the oxygen concentration using a special fibre optic probe. The working tip of the probe was dip-coated with a ruthenium complex immobilised in a sol-gel matrix. This complex is excited to fluorescence by a blue led (470 nm outpuk peak) and the level of the fluorescence is inversely related to the concentration of the oxygen through the Stern-Volmer equation (Wang et al., 1999), which is measured by the fibre-optic apparatus. Retention of solid phases (e. g. catalyst beads and yeast cells) inside the meso reactor will also be tested. Further studies using the Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique will be presented where accurate prediction of the distribution of residence times is achieved. The use of the distributionfunctions permits to classify the flow behaviour inside this novel meso reactor patterns and to calculate mixing efficiencies and axial dispersion coefficients (expressed by the Bo number) at different oscillation conditions. A simple 2 -D axisymmetric laminar model showed good agreement with flow patterns visualisations using PIV for Reo below 100 but a 3 -D model with a very fine mesh was required to simulate breakage of axisymmetry. Consequently, 3 -D models based on laminar and Large Eddy Simulations (LES) will be used to maximize the matching of RTD at higher oscillation conditions. Main intended application of CFDs to this novel meso reactor is the design of a meso reactor unit, which could operate at the best oscillation conditions and flow rate for cell cultures and biocatalyst applications...|$|E
40|$|CHAIRMAN’S SPEECH 16 th International Congress, Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons(SLS), San Francisco, USA, September 2007. It is an honour to {{be asked}} to be the Honorary Chairman for the 16 th SLS Congress, and I {{strongly}} feel that our SLS is the leader of multi-disciplinary endoscopic surgery worldwide. In fact endoscopic surgery is practically feasible and offers many advantages including better exposure of the operation field, magnification and adequate panoramic view, and operating very close to the affected tissue 1. During {{the latter part of the}} 20 th Century, endoscopy revolutionised surgical practice so much that clinicians who do not practice advanced endoscopic techniques would be losing an important dimension of contemporary surgical practice 2. With the early introduction of endoscopy in surgical disciplines, it was not uncommon to perform diagnostic endoscopy to diagnose a pathology; followed by a laparotomy to affect definitive treatment 3, 4. “Conversion” to laparotomy has known complications 5. While conventional surgery will continue to be a part, albeit diminishing, in professional training programs 6, 7, endoscopy is the “gold standard” approach to manage the majority of surgical problems both in elective and emergency situations 8 - 15. This immeasurable improvement has eventuated as a result of continuous upgrading of endoscopic surgical skills and knowledge, technological advances at diagnostic and operative spheres, improved instrumentation and better interdisciplinary co-operation between active clinicians practicing relevant fields of endoscopic surgery 16 - 21 and hence the valuable role played by multi-disciplinary endoscopic societies notably Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons. As the future is a continuum of the past and present and without ideas there is nothing; without ideas and without innovation there is nothing to test 22. It may be relevant to consider some historical aspects of endoscopy. As a gynaecologist, I shall discuss the rocky paths of laparoscopy and hysteroscopy. For centuries, physicians aspired to inspect different body cavities by the use of visual aid 23. In Laparoscopy Many innovations took place in the world of gynaecological endoscopy, and one has to mention with admiration the creative work of the leading pioneers. Attempts at visualising the contents of the abdominal/pelvic cavity were made approximately 1000 years ago as reported by the Arabian physician, Abukasim (936 – 1013 AD) 24. However, the details of this apparently primitive attempt were not clear. In 1901, Kelling made the first attempt to inspect the peritoneal cavity with insufflation. He called it “Koeliskopie”. He reported the abdominal organs were much smaller than normal. That was because he created a very high pneumoperitoneum pressure of 50 - 60 mm Hg and once even 100 mm Hg. He employed air to distend the peritoneum 25. In 1910, Jacobaeus from Stockholm coined the term laparoscopy. He did not use pneumoperitoneum as most of his patients had ascites 26. In 1927, Korbsch suggested that the use of carbon dioxide (CO 2) instead of air to a pressure less than 15 cm H 2 O. Unlike air which contains about 79 % nitrogen, CO 2 is readily absorbed within the body 27. In 1937, Ruddock published his series of 2500 laparoscopic sterilisation. He designed his own telescope, trocar, and pneumoperitoneum needle 28. His contemporary, Hope, suggested the use of laparoscopy in the evaluation of ectopic pregnancies 29. In 1944, Decker and Cherry introduced culdoscopy to visualise abdominal contents. It was performed with the patient under local anaesthesia and in the knee-chest position 30. Culdoscopy dominated pelvic endoscopy in the United States for over 20 years. Concerned about the number of unnecessary laparotomies, the late British gynaecologist, Steptoe (1913 – 1988), the father of IVF (in-vitro fertilisation), travelled to Boston and New York, USA, in 1958, to learn about culdoscopy. Unfortunately, Steptoe left America disappointed with the practical value of culdoscopy 31. In 1963, Semm, a German gynaecologist from Kiel University, developed the automatic insufflator “CO 2 - Pneu” that allowed more complex laparoscopic procedures to be performed. In 1979, Semm perfected his apparatus, creating an electronic insufflator; fully monitored pneumoperitoneum became possible 32. Semm was one of the world’s leaders of gynaecological endoscopy. However, the path was not all easy for him; but he overcame by persistence. In the seventies, his colleagues suggested only a person with brain damage would perform laparoscopic surgery, and they persuaded Semm to have a brain scan 33 ! In 1983, Semm reported the first laparoscopic appendicectomy 34. The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology rejected Semm’s paper on laparoscopic appendicectomy. One of the reviewers questioned the ethical aspect of this procedure 34 ! In 1985, Muhe of Boblingen, Germany, performed the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The German Surgical Society rejected Muhe in 1986 after he reported his pioneer operation, and the society considered the operation to be unethical. As he was ahead of his time, he received their highest award in 1992 35. In 1989, Harry Reich of Pennsylvania, USA, reported the first laparoscopic hysterectomy, a procedure that had new concepts and dimensions 36, 37 -; but, again, was not well received in its infancy especially by those physicians who could not perform the operation. And we have just heard the story of struggle of our good friend Professor Hary Hasson and his excellent technique of Open Laparoscopy 38 and many other patents that have been proudly adopted and practiced worldwide by many high profile Endoscopic Surgeons. The invention of a rod lens optical system by Hopkins in 1959 and the addition of fibre-optic light transmission by Storz in 1960 have been vital for modern endoscopy. Similarly, an important milestone in laparoscopy was the development of a video computer chip in 1987; that allowed magnification and projection of images onto television screens 39 - 42. In 1987,C. Nezhat published a much awaited report about the use of videolaparoscopy in Advanced Gynaecological Endoscopic Surgery. This was an important milestone in the development and successful practice of not only minimally- invasive gynaecological operations, but, also, many other disciplines and sub-specialities of surgery 42, 43. The techniques of video laparoscopic surgery became integrated into general and specialised surgery alike, and were vital for purposes of training, teaching and involving all operating theatre personnel in the following of surgical procedures. In Hysteroscopy Similar to laparoscopy, the modern operative hysteroscope evolved through many stages of development. The uterine cavity, like any other cavity in the body, is empty and dark and is a potential (not a real) cavity. In 1807, Bozini described a vase-shaped lantern made of tin and covered with leather to examine the uterine cavity. Interestingly, he declared that “adhesions, polyps and tumours will be operated upon under direct vision” 44. In 1869, Pantaleoni wrote on “endoscopic examination of the cavity of the womb” in which he stated that invention of the ophthalmoscope and laryngoscope led to the invention of the endoscope 45. The problem was how to throw sufficient light into an internal dark cavity. However, later on in the nineteenth century, Dr Cruise of Dublin introduced a light and prevented the instrument from becoming heated by light 46. In 1908, David, Paris University, wrote “sheaths and hysteroscopes of different sizes were made to meet anatomic variations in size, length and degree of cervical dilatation” 47. After these early contributions, illumination systems changed from candle-light and reflected light and were replaced by the electric bulb and distal lighting, proximal lighting, halogen, and xenon light systems and, most recently, fibre-optic systems 48. The initial attempts led to a long process of continuous improvement that allowed the gynaecological surgeon to perform complicated hysteroscopic and laparoscopic procedures without resort to laparotomy. Recent advances in <b>fibre-optic</b> <b>technology</b> have been the cornerstone of adequate visualisation of the operation field, which is the essential prerequisite of any operative procedure anywhere in the body 49 - 51. In essence, clinicians learned from their mistakes as well as their colleagues in different specialities of medicine. They all had great obstacles to overcome; nevertheless, they rose to the challenge and proved that success is an ongoing journey. At this point in time, clinicians and patients are cashing in on the benefits of the work of our predecessors. However, today’s challenges are by no means simple. Training and quality assurance are important issues 52 - 54. The surgeon must pass through a learning curve to acquire and maintain new skills and special expertise, and to avoid, recognise and manage complications of advanced endoscopic surgery 55. In fact, the learning process has to be closely tied with a vigorous system of quality assurance. A balance has to be struck between the ethical obligations to benefit patients while avoiding harm, and the professional expectation of continued learning, and this has to be maintained and expanded as long as surgical practice continues so that surgeons will be able to successfully follow the ever moving horizon of endoscopic surgery. The development and continuous progression of endoscopic surgery is a cumulative effort of internists, gynaecologists, urologists and surgeons alike. Hence, multi-disciplinary societies of minimally invasive surgery, notably the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgery, play a leading role in the 21 st Century.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on an {{experimental}} study of the pressure conditions in the refining zone of high-consistency refiners used in paper making. The work presents the findings from two different mill-scale experiments in addition to results obtained from a pilot refiner study. The experiments have been performed using two different types of pressure sensors: • Fibre-optic pressure sensors based on extrinsic Fabry Perot interferometer (EFPI). • Piezoresistive temperature and pressure transducers. This study has shown {{that it is possible to}} establish high-frequency pressure measurements in the refining zone of high-consistency refiners. Data have been collected at rates up to 20 million samples per second. The fibre-optic sensors seem to be preferable to the piezoresistive transducers as the fibre-optic sensors were working well after long exposure to the harsh environment inside the refining zone. Reliable measurements were still obtained after 1000 operating hours. On the other hand, the piezoresistive sensors suffered from problems caused by the wet environment inside the refiner as well as from the electrical dependent circuits and transmission cables. However, in the pilot refiner under less harsh environment, the piezoresistive transducer functioned well. The main focus in this thesis has been related to the second mill-scale experiment which used fibre-optic pressure sensors. The results obtained from this experiment are considered to be more valuable than those from the first mill-scale experiment which used combined piezoresistive pressure and temperature transducers. Furthermore, pulp samples were collected during the second mill-scale experiment allowing an even more comprehensive analysis. However, the results from the first mill-scale experiment are shown as a comparison and in order to demonstrate the challenge of selecting the appropriate technology. Results from a successfully test performed in the pilot refiner, which also used a combined piezoresistive pressure and temperature transducer, are shown as well. In addition, as a supplement to the results from the mill-scale experiment with fibre-optic sensors, an experiment which employed external accelerometers for measuring the high-frequency vibrations in the mill refiner is discussed. Another supplement was made through an experiment measuring the deviation of the rotational speed of the refiner shaft. The main objective of this study has been to find out how to make high-frequency pressure measurements in the refining zone of a mill-scale high-consistency TMP refiner. The study has particularly focused on the signal analyses and the reliability of the pressure measurements. Since the investigations have been focused on the experimental issues, assessments are primarily made regarding the recorded data and the related process observations. One of the challenges was to find suitable technology for use in a harsh environment. Obtaining and selecting an appropriate sensor was extremely important. A fast responding sensor was prerequisite. It was of particular interest to investigate the pressure pulses generated from the squeezing of wood particles between the sensor surface and the bars on the opposite disc. In addition, the dimension of the sensor surface had to be small so that the peak pressures could be determined. The size should preferably be smaller than a width of a bar. Especially the fibre-optic sensors met this criterion as they had a surface diameter of approximately 1 mm. The piezoresistive sensors had a surface diameter of 3. 8 mm. Mill-scale experiments were conducted to test the sensors in a realistic environment. The design of the experiments was important in the assessment of the performance of the sensors during different controlled conditions. Collecting of pulp samples to assess the pulp quality of the primary refining in comparison to the process behaviour and the pressure signals were matters of additional interest. The analyses of the experiment should give conclusions about the reliability of the sensors. A goal of the present work has also been to examine the behaviour and the properties of the pressure signals, and investigate the origin of the pressure pulses. Most of the results are from high-frequency measurements of pressure in the refining zone of a high-consistency TMP refiner. Combined temperature and pressure measurements are shown from the test in the pilot refiner. The fast development within sensor and computer technology has made it possible to achieve measurements that have not been performed earlier. The use of <b>fibre-optic</b> sensor <b>technology</b> in chip refiners has not been reported earlier. The high-frequency recordings using sample rates of up to 20 MSamples/s suffered from the lack of demodulation technology such that the accuracy of the absolute pressure readings is limited. However, this study indicates average pressures between 20 and 30 bar in the intermediate zone. Even more interesting is the fast pressure changes obtained using frequency analysis. Common frequencies indicating vibrations in the discs appearing from the pressure pulses when the pulp is squeezed between the bars of the stator and rotor disc have been observed. This observation was supported by vibration analysis using external accelerometers. It is claimed that there is a relationship between vibrations in the refiner discs and the pressure pulses that are generated from the squeezing of pulp between bars on the rotor and stator disc. However, nobody has investigated this particular relationship although this study strongly indicates that this relationship exists. Furthermore, it is shown that the pressure sensors were not affected by vibrations operating in resonance. This strongly supports the conclusion that the fibre-optic pressure sensors were solely measuring the activities in the refining zone. The frequency analysis of the different recordings gave firm evidence of the process related influences of the pressure readings. The reliability of the performance of the sensors was clearly visible through this analysis technique. Several analyses found that the shift in the bar crossing frequencies was directly proportional to and caused by fluctuations in the rotational speed of the refiner. However, local bar crossing frequencies were generally not as clear as expected. The measurements indicated that some specific radial positions determined by the tapered plate pattern, dominated the responses. Among the most dominating frequencies were periodicities associated with the rotational speed of the refiner, the number of bars in the breaker bar and coarse zones as well as the transition zone between the intermediate and fine bar zones. When the plates were new, a 25. 2 kHz periodicity that arose from a bar-to-bar passage in the fine bar zone dominated the pressure readings. These pulses probably propagated in the disc so that the whole disc vibrated. It is not assumed that these vibrations generated large plate gap variations. However, these fluctuations were predominant compared with the local generated pressure pulses. The pressure variations probably propagated through the steam and pulp pad as pressure waves. Thus the pulp and steam flow through the whole refining zone was affected. The local bar crossing frequencies were suppressed and only visible to a minor extent. It is conceivable that the steam and pulp interacts through a two-phase flow. Thus the steam may have a repressive effect on the interaction between the pulp pad and the bar patterns on the discs. Recordings during different controlled operating conditions were used to study the reliability of the sensors. The relationship between the pressure signals and the process variables has been investigated as well. The most reliable relationship was obtained when changing the chip flow to the refining zone after 1000 hours of operating time. The motor load and acceleration variables were strongly correlated with the pressure readings. No strong correlations were found between the data from the pressure sensors and the process variables shortly after start-up using new plates. The pulp samples that were collected and analysed did not give a good relationship between the pressure signals and the quality data. However, during this period other process disturbances affected the conditions in the refining zone more than the randomized manipulation of the control variables. This was observed as time dependent variations in the pressure recordings as well as several process variables. The most probable disturbance was the amount of chips fed to the refiner and subsequent changes of the plate gap. Further indications imply that the pressure sensors were sensitive to variations in the incoming stream of chips. Besides the successful test when changing the chip flow to the refining zone, frequency analyses have showed that the sensors also were affected by periodicities in the pulp flow that were related to the inner part of the refining zone and the breaker bar section. This was shown both as sideband effects as well as plain peak frequencies. Sideband effects are interpreted as periodic waves of pulp flow propagated through the refining zone. This study indicates that the average pressure in the intermediate zone of the refining zone of the mill-scale TMP refiner was as high as 20 - 30 bar. This was somewhat higher than expected from the theoretical considerations. However, the theoretical calculations have some limiting factors, which there are some disagreement in the literature. The area where the energy is applied in the refining zone as well as the tangential friction coefficient is not clearly determined. Both are included in one of the theoretical approaches. Thus there are some uncertainties associated with the models. However, some uncertainties are related to the determination of the pressure levels for the measurements using the fibre-optic sensors as well. This is mainly due to the lack of well-established demodulation techniques for the sinusoidal relation between the sensor signal and the pressure. This is the greatest weakness in this part of the investigation. The pressure levels obtained using the piezoresistive sensors were to some extent agreeable with the fibre-optic measurements. However, there was greater uncertainty in the piezoresistive measurements due to probable disturbances related to electromagnetic noise or moisture having a detrimental influence on electric circuits in the sensors. The most interesting results obtained using the piezoresistive sensors in the mill-scale experiment have been observations of process relevant periodic signal patterns. Stable average pressures between 2 and 4. 5 bar were found in the atmospheric pilot refiner during normal operating conditions. Since the local bar crossing frequency did not dominate the periodicities obtained from these recordings it is assumed that the steam affected the pressure conditions in the refining zone. This is assumed despite the fact that the refiner was atmospheric. Pressure peaks above 10 bar were observed frequently. When the plate gap decreased, the pressure pulses were considerably higher. Pressure peaks up to 60 bar were observed during operation with a small plate clearance. The local bar crossing frequency was clearly visible under such conditions, not otherwise. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
