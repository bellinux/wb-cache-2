[...] During a radio appearance in San Francisco, Eminem reportedly angered local DJ Sista Tamu due to a freestyle about [...] "slapping a pregnant bitch" [...] {{to the extent that}} she broke a copy of The Slim Shady LP on-air. The rapper defended himself by saying, [...] "My album isn't for younger kids to hear. It has an advisory sticker, and you must be eighteen to get it.

[...] According to Safire in a 2007 column, Moore stuck his head into the compartment occupied by Nixon's speechwriters and stated, [...] "There's a little <b>kid</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> with a hand-lettered sign that I think says 'Bring Us Together'."

500|$|... "Movin' Down the Line", an ode to a love unrequited, {{features}} mellow horns, jangling guitar, heavy bass lines, and a swelling {{string and}} piano conclusion. In {{the opinion of}} Lloyd Bradley, the song exemplifies the album's combination of traditional styles and contemporary production: [...] "It has every bit of digital snap needed to succeed among today’s sounds; but Saadiq's masterful use of a big brass section lurking w-a-a-ay into the background picks the tune up and puts it down {{in a completely different}} era. The song turns out both laidback and urgent at the same time, and is utterly irrepressible for it". Containing a psychedelic funk sound, [...] "Just Don't" [...] is sung {{from the point of view}} of a dejected narrator as realizes his woman has moved on from him. The song features guest vocals by Yukimi Nagano and an extended Moog solo played [...] by Larry Dunn. [...] "Good Man" [...] contains plaintive lyrics, a hook co-written and sung by vocalist Taura Stinson, and lyrics about a man mourning his partner's unfaithfulness. The album's closing track, [...] "The Answer", features a wistful, jazz-funk sound, and lyrics expressing a call for collective and individual responsibility. Saadiq said, [...] "I always have a song similar to that on my albums. I was just thinking about growing up in Oakland and all the older people and mentors who helped me out at the time. So I just wanted to throw it back and say thank you, and tell all the <b>kids</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> to listen to the people trying to guide them".|$|E

Roth as Jonny, George Segal as Dr. Quest, Robert Patrick as Race, Jesse Douglas as Jessie, Michael Benyaer as Hadji, and veteran voice actor Frank Welker as Dr. Jeremiah Surd. A childhood {{fan of the}} original series, J.D. Roth was inspired by Turner's vision for the new series and swiftly accepted the role of Jonny. Roth was attracted by Jonny's [...] "star quality", and approved of his characterization as a real kid without superpowers. He enjoyed Jonny's infectious enthusiasm and impulsive alacrity. Roth also admired the show's educational quality, something {{he had tried to}} integrate in his personal television pilots. When asked about how he played the relationship with Jonny's father, he commented, [...] "Jonny is crazy about his dad. He looks up to him and thinks he is the smartest man ever to walk to face of the earth. He has the typical teenage relationship with his father, but his father definitely sees something in him. Dr. Quest knows that Jonny is going to be something really special." [...] Michael Benyaer also enjoyed playing Hadji: [...] " [...] {{is one of the few}} roles for an ethnic actor that is not a bad guy. I mean, how many East Indian heroes have been on television? Hadji is for the sensitive <b>kids</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> He is the outsider in all of us." [...] A Star Wars fan, Benyaer was happy to work with Mark Hamill for [...] "In the Realm of the Condor". Peter Lawrence's request for an Indian-descended voice actor was seen as an [...] "unusual case of multi-ethnic casting".|$|E

This is honest. Hosting The Tonight Show has been the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for me. And I just want to say to the <b>kids</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> watching: You can do anything you want in life. Yeah, yeah—unless Jay Leno wants to do it, too." [...] Following the joke, Leno called Gaspin, asking, [...] "Why the fuck am I giving up a half hour for this guy?"

In 1965, Sparma was in his first full season with the Tigers, when {{he was assigned to}} be the starting pitcher against the Yankees on [...] "Mickey Mantle Day" [...] in New York. When Mantle came to bat {{for the first time in}} the game, Sparma walked off the mound, approached Mantle, and said: [...] "You know, I've never had a chance to meet you in person, and I've always admired you." [...] Sparma and Mantle shook hands, and Sparma went back to the mound and struck Mantle out. Mantle turned to Detroit's catcher Bill Freehan and said: [...] "They have a day for me and your manager's got to put some hard-throwing <b>kid</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> Couldn't he have put in some soft-tossing left-hander for me to hit off of, so I could look like a hero in front of all those people?"

Jones also broadcast and endorsed one listener's suggestion that bikie gangs be brought down to Cronulla railway station to deal with [...] "Lebanese thugs" [...] and that the event be televised, arguing that despite their reputation bikie gangs do [...] "a lot of good things". By Thursday, Jones had stirred significant discussion, and stated [...] "I'm the person that's led this charge here. Nobody {{wanted to know about}} North Cronulla, now it's gathered to this." [...] Jones was later found to have breached the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) [...] section 1.3(a), as his comments were [...] "likely to encourage violence or brutality and to vilify people of Lebanese and Middle-Eastern backgrounds on the basis of ethnicity".|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{produced}} the pilot episode, [...] "Trash-O-Madness", at his studio in Saratoga; he animated {{half of the}} episode, and the production occurred entirely in the United States, with animation in Saratoga and processing in San Francisco. While directing during recording sessions, Murray preferred {{to be on the}} stage with the actors instead of [...] "behind glass" [...] in a control room, which he describes as [...] "the norm" [...] while making animated series. He believes that, due to his lack of experience with children, Rocko's Modern Life [...] "skewed kind of older". Murray noted, [...] "There's a lot of big <b>kids</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> People went to see 'Roger Rabbit' and saw all these characters they'd grown up with and said, 'Yeah, why don't they have something like that anymore?'" [...] When he began producing Rocko, he says that his experience in independent films initially led him to attempt to micromanage many details in the production. He said that the approach, when used for production of television shows, was [...] "driving me crazy". This led him to allow for other team members to manage aspects of the Rocko's Modern Life production. Director and later creative director Stephen Hillenburg met Murray at an animation film festival where he was showing his three short films. Murray hired Hillenburg as a director on the series, making Hillenburg's first job in the animation business as a director.|$|E

Lennon was starting to record his memoirs on tape. He's going on about 'trying to start a revolution from me bed, because they said the brains I had went to my head.' I thought 'Thank you, I'll take that'!" [...] "Revolution from me bed" [...] most likely refers to Lennon's notorious bed-ins in 1969. The piano in {{the introduction of the}} song strongly resembles Lennon's [...] "Imagine", as well as [...] "Watching the Wheels". As Oasis are often criticised for borrowing parts of other artists' songs for their own, Noel Gallagher commented on the intro's similarity to [...] "Imagine" [...] saying, [...] "In the case of Don't Look Back in Anger – I mean, the opening piano riff's Imagine. 50% of it's put in there to wind people up, and the other 50% is saying 'look, this is how songs like Don't Look Back in Anger come about – because they're inspired by songs like Imagine'. And no matter what people might think, there will be some 13 year old <b>kid</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who'll read an interview and think 'Imagine? I've never heard that song' and he might go and buy the album, you know what I mean?"
