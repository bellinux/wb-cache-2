He shows the extent to which differences in logic also translate as significant differences in the intergenerational principles to be followed, using notions of savings and <b>dissavings.</b> Special attention is being paid to two reasons why the directives of a luck egalitarian theory of intergenerational justice do not necessarily coincide with Brundtland's view on intergenerational justice. Such differences become clear once we understand that, as a matter of principle, luck egalitarians should oppose not only generational <b>dissavings,</b> but also generational savings, hence stick to a strict "neither less, nor more" rule...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop optimization-based {{approaches}} for modeling multi-agent and multi-regional social security systems under demographic and economic uncertainties. Conceptually, the proposed model deals with the production and consumption processes coevolving with "birth-and-death" processes of the participating agents. Uncertainties concern fertility, life expectancy, migration and such economic and health variables as rate of return, incomes and disability rates. The goal is to satisfy a reasonable and secure consumption of agents. There is considerable similarity between the decisions involved in the optimization of social security systems and the production planning processes: in both cases "savings" are taken in periods of low demand and "dissavings" when the demand turns high. The significant difference of our problem is that decisions on savings and <b>dissavings</b> may have large-scale effects on the whole economy, in particular, they effect returns on savings through investments and capital formation. The model tracks incomes and expenditures of agents, their savings and <b>dissavings,</b> as well as intergenerational and interregional transfers of wealth. Robust management strategies are defined by using such risk indicators as ruin, shortfall and Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR). The adaptive Monte Carlo optimization procedure is proposed to derive optimal decisions. Numerical experiments and possible applications to catastrophic risk management are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Let us {{assume that}} income grows as a {{consequence}} of population growth—or due to growth in income per employed, itself a consequence of increasing productivity.

If the size of the cohorts born in successive years grows at the rate p then both population and the aggregate income grow at the rate p. As a result of this growth there is an increase in the ratio of younger individuals in their earning phase to retired individuals in their <b>dissaving</b> phase—which leads to a positive net flow of saving.|$|E
40|$|I look at wealth trends from 1962 to 2013, {{particularly}} for the middle class. Asset prices plunged between 2007 and 2010 but then rebounded from 2010 to 2013. The most telling finding is that median wealth plummeted by 44 percent between 2007 and 2010, almost double the drop in housing prices. Wealth inequality, after almost two decades of little movement, was up sharply from 2007 to 2010. This sharp fall in median net worth and rise in overall wealth inequality are traceable primarily to the high leverage of middle-class families, the high share of homes in their portfolio, and the plunge in house prices. Rather remarkably, median (and mean) wealth did not essentially change from 2010 to 2013 despite the rebound in asset prices. The proximate cause was the high <b>dissavings</b> of the middle class.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} optimization-based {{approaches for}} a social security simulation model under demographic and economic uncertainties. The model is a compromise between a purely actuarial model and an overlapping generations general equilibrium model. It deals with production and consumption processes coevolving with “birth-and-death” processes of involved agents, e. g., region-specific households subdivided into single-year age groups, firms, governments, financial intermediaries, including pension systems and insurance. The production function of the model allows to track incomes expenditures, savings and <b>dissavings</b> of agents, as well as intergenerational and interregional transfers of wealth. The proposed approach combines the actuarial and the economic growth simulation models in a single stochastic optimization model which explicitly and realistically treats the underlying uncertainties with the goal to satisfy reasonable and secure consumption of agents. The design of optimal robust strategies is achieved by an adaptive simulation-based optimization procedure defined by non-smooth risk functions. Numerical solution is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Using primary {{household}} data we estimate family utility function parameters that measure {{the relative importance}} of consumption, schooling of children and health (both physical and mental) and find that mental health is far more important than consumption or children’s schooling in determining household utility. We then estimate the monetary equivalent of the welfare loss at the all India level we due to the only 0. 36 % prevalence of HIV/AIDS is a staggering 2000 (50) billion rupees ($) per year, which exceeds the annual health expenditure of the country in 2004 and 7 % of its GDP! This huge magnitude is not surprising as it includes private valuation of one's own life as well as the cost of stigma for being HIV positive. In addition, the annual loss from external transfers (through debt, <b>dissavings</b> and social insurance) account for 2. 5 % of annual health expenditure and 0. 12 % of GDP. 1 We are thankful to the World Bank for funding this study.

50|$|In an {{unpublished}} paper {{written with}} R. Brumberg, {{it was observed}} that if we make some rational guesses about the average duration of working life and retired life and additionally assume that the rate of earning is constant until retirement and so is the rate of consumption combined with a zero rate of return on net worth we can find that in a stationary economy of constant population and productivity, the aggregate stock of wealth would be very significant. Moreover, under the given conditions, the aggregate rate of saving would become zero as the level of positive saving by the individuals during their earning years would be offset by the <b>dissaving</b> of the retired households using up their earlier accumulation. Hence, wealth remains constant in totality while it is constantly being transferred from dissavers to savers in exchange for current resources.|$|E
50|$|We now {{consider}} {{the situation where}} population is stationary but average income earned at each age, and hence, aggregate income rises continuously over time due to increasing productivity. This also tends {{to lead to a}} positive rate of saving and a growing stock of wealth. This is because each successive cohort enjoys earning greater than the preceding cohorts, and thus a large level of consumption at each age—since, by assumption, the allocation of consumption over life remains unchanged in time. Moreover, this implies that the currently working generation will aim for a level of consumption in their post-retirement years larger than the consumption enjoyed by the currently retired individuals belonging to a less affluent generation. To support this future level of consumption post-retirement, the working individuals must save currently on a scale higher than the <b>dissaving</b> of the retired households. Hence even if population is stationary, net aggregate saving tends to be positive.|$|E

Second, we argue that, {{in the presence of}} annuities, estimates of <b>dissaving</b> should be adjusted by including the simple discounted value of benefits in total wealth. Such adjustments reveal relatively little <b>dissaving</b> among any group of retirees. Finally, we test the pure life cycle hypothesis by observing the behavioral response of rates of accumulation to involuntary annuitization, and find empirical refutation of life cycle implications. ...|$|E

In other words, is this insurance strong enough to affect their <b>dissavings</b> behaviours? To answer this question, I build a life-cycle model of retired households in which couples are modelled explicitly and in which the above informal insurance channel is introduced through the presence of home produc-tion. Quantitatively, the model replicates the main patterns of savings and informal insurance observed in the data. Shutting down this informal insurance has only a minor influence on the wealth patterns of retired couples, casting doubt on the idea that it provides a strong protec-tion against disability-related expenditures in old age. The positive correlation of disability risk between partners and the high risk of being widowed while disabled are key to this result. †I would like to thank my advisors Hippolyte d’Albis and Agar Brugiavini for help and comments as well as David de la Croix who welcomed me for a visiting period in Université Catholique de Louvain (UCL).

40|$|India {{could not}} {{insulate}} {{itself from the}} adverse developments in the international financial markets, despite having a banking and financial system that {{had little to do}} with investments in structured financial instruments carved out of subprime mortgages, whose failure had set off the chain of events culminating in a global crisis. Economic growth decelerated in 2008 - 09 to 6. 7 percent. This represented a decline of 2. 1 percent from the average growth rate of 8. 8 percent in the previous five years. To counter the negative fallout of the global slowdown on the Indian economy, the federal Government responded by providing three focused fiscal stimulus packages in the form of tax relief to boost demand and increased expenditure on public projects to create employment and public assets. India's central Bank — the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) took a number of monetary easing and liquidity enhancing measures to facilitate flow of funds from the financial system to meet the needs of productive sectors. From all accounts, except for the agricultural sector initially as noted above, economic recovery seems to be well underway. Economic growth stood at 8. 6 percent during fiscal year 2010 - 11. GDP growth for 2009 - 10 was placed at 8 percent. When compared to countries across the world, India stands out as one of the best performing economies. Although there was a clear moderation in growth from 9 percent levels to 7 + percent soon after the crisis hit, in 2010 - 11, at 8. 6 percent, GDP growth in nearing the pre-crisis levels and this pace makes India the fastest growing major economy after China. Considering the current inflationary strains, the as yet excessive pre-emption of the community's savings by the government, the potential for crowding out the requirements of the enterprise sector, and rising interest payments on government debt, it is extremely essential to reduce the fiscal deficit, and more aggressively, mainly by lowering the revenue deficit. Correction of these deficits would, inter alia, require considerable refocusing and reduction of large hidden subsidies associated with under-pricing in crucial areas, such as power, irrigation, and urban transport. Food and fertilizer subsidies are other major areas of expenditure control. Be that as it may, the process of fiscal consolidation needs to be accelerated through more qualitative adjustments to reduce government <b>dissavings</b> and ameliorate price pressures. The step-up in India's growth rate over much of the last two decades was primarily due to the structural changes in industrial, trade and financial areas, among others, over the 1990 s as the reforms in these sectors were wide and deep and hence contributed significantly to higher productivity of the economy. Indeed, there is potential for still higher growth on a sustained basis of 9 + percent in the years ahead, but among other things, this would require the following: 1) revival and a vigorous pursuit of economic reforms at the center and in the states; 2) a major effort at raising the rate of domestic savings, especially by reducing government <b>dissavings</b> at the central and state levels through cuts in, and refocusing of, explicit and implicit subsidies, stricter control over non-developmental expenditures, improvements in the tax ratio through stronger tax enforcement, and strengthening incentives for savings; 3) larger investments in, and better performance of, infrastructural services, both in the public and private sectors; and 4) greater attention to, and larger resources for, agriculture, social sectors and rural development programs to increase employment, reduce poverty and for creating a mass base in support of economic reforms...|$|R

Also {{available by}} subscription via World Wide Webxi, 158 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmWe first clarify {{that changes in}} fundamental paper wealth are wealth redistributions between current and future asset owners; and increases in fundamental paper wealth tend to make current consumers wealthier and hence have positive impacts on current aggregate consumption. Based {{on the concept of}} fundamental paper wealth, we examine three issues related to asset prices. The first issue is related to the wealth effect of monetary policy. While the wealth and Tobin's q effects are usually treated as two independent monetary policy transmission mechanisms, we show that they are indeed negatively correlated under a general-equilibrium perspective; and their magnitudes depend upon investment elasticity. These insights provide a new perspective to the relationship between asset prices and monetary policy. Another issue is related to the capital account policy of developing countries. Empirical evidence shows that capital inflows are often used by developing countries to finance excessive consumption. While the existing literature generally explains these phenomena as resulting from institutional imperfections, we show that they can be the results of fundamental paper wealth effect caused by capital inflows. We show that, while risk aversion causes low investment elasticity and hence reduces the total benefit of capital account liberalization for society over time, it nevertheless tends to make current consumers better off and drive consumption booms. We show that a positive yet uncertain future productivity shock is likely to cause consumption booms because of sluggish investment reactions. The third issue is related to the "asset market meltdown hypothesis", which predicts that baby boomers' prime-time savings will drive up asset prices that will eventually collapse due to their retirement <b>dissavings.</b> While the existing literature generally supports the hypothesis, we find that the meltdown is actually state-contingent and may not necessarily happen because the large capital stock built up by baby boomers' large savings may be able to sustain the asset prices during baby boomers' retirement era. However, we find that, in the case where the meltdown is about to happen, baby boomers as a whole has no escape; and their attempts to escape could push the economy into a liquidity trap...|$|R
40|$|Trade, aid, and {{investment}} are more inextricably linked in sub-Saharan Africa {{than anywhere else}} in the world, contends the author, whose survey of sub-Saharan Africa's prospects for trade, aid, {{and investment}} lead to the following broad conclusions. Developing an outward orientation, improving competitiveness, and recapturing its lost share in world markets offers a higher potential payoff than any other strategy for growth and sustainable development in sub-Saharan countries. If the region had maintained internal competitiveness and retained its 1970 share of world exports, successfully defending against new entrants, its 1990 level of exports would have been at least $ 50 billion higher than actual earnings - assuming that the composition of sub-Saharan exports would have changed to reflect changes in world trade. If the region continued to rely on exports of commodity products alone, the relative gains would have been much smaller. In the last decade, sub-Saharan Africa has become increasingly dependent on external resource flows for investment, imports, and development. But there is little chance of sustained high levels of aid because of budget constraints in the OECD countries, competing demands from new claimants, and the new conditionalities imposed by bilateral donors (for democratization, reduced military spending, and improved human rights). Most African countries must mobilize domestic resources and increase domestic savings rates by reducing public sector <b>dissavings,</b> the financial losses of public enterprises, and other nonproductive spending. Certain low-middle-income African countries can attract a significant amount of foreign direct investment, but most resource-poor countries - especially in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa - will continue to depend on foreign aid. There must be a more durable solution to Africa's debt problem. Only half of the debt service due can be paid, suggesting the urgent need to reduce the debt stock and thus debt servicing obligations, in alignment with debt servicing capacity. Many current proposals under discussion, if implemented, can bring considerable relief. Several sub-Saharan countries can attractsignificant investment because of their location, low labor costs, natural resource endowments, and the size of their domestic market. But productive investment levels in most African countries have remained depressed, and even where economic policy reform has been implemented, the investor response - both domestic and foreign - has been poor. Uncertainty, fears of policy reversals, lack of credibility and continuity, the contagion effect, and more attractive opportunities elsewhere reinforce such structural weaknesses in sub-Saharan Africa as poor infrastructure, inefficient services, and a weak human resource base to deprive Africa of new investment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) {{is a major}} global {{public health}} problem which affects poorest {{individuals}} the worst. A high proportion of patients incur 'catastrophic costs' which {{have been shown to}} result in severe financial hardship and adverse health outcomes. Data on catastrophic cost incidence is not routinely collected, and current definitions of this indicator involve several practical and conceptual barriers to doing so. We analysed data from TB programmes in India (Bangalore), Bangladesh and Tanzania to determine whether <b>dissaving</b> (the sale of assets or uptake of loans) is a useful indicator of financial hardship. METHODS: Data were obtained from prior studies of TB patient costs in Bangladesh (N[*]=[*] 96), Tanzania (N[*]=[*] 94) and Bangalore (N[*]=[*] 891). These data were analysed using logistic and linear multivariate regression to determine the association between costs (absolute and relative to income) and both the presence of <b>dissaving</b> and the amounts dissaved. RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates such as age, sex and rural/urban location, we found a significant positive association between the occurrence of <b>dissaving</b> and total costs incurred in Tanzania and Bangalore. We further found that, for patients in Bangalore an increase in <b>dissaving</b> of 10 USD was associated with an increase in the cost-income ratio of 0. 10 (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). For low-income patients in Bangladesh, an increase in <b>dissaving</b> of 10 USD was associated with an increase in total costs of 7 USD (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Dissaving</b> is potentially a convenient proxy for catastrophic costs that does not require usage of complex patient cost questionnaires. It also offers an informative indicator of financial hardship in its own right, and could therefore play an important role as an indicator to monitor and evaluate the impact of financial protection and service delivery interventions in reducing hardship and facilitating universal health coverage. Further research is required to understand the patterns and types of <b>dissaving</b> that have the strongest relationship with financial hardship and clinical outcomes in order to move toward evidence-based policy making...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 This study {{examined}} the financial management practices {{of a group of}} middle and upper class retired couples in a period of rising prices and relatively fixed incomes. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe (1) financial planning of retired couples, (2) expenditures of these couples, (3) adjustments of their expenditures to income, (4) place of credit in their financial management, (5) financial management problems faced since retirement, and (6) feeling about their financial position. The data were obtained from a sample of 50 couples who considered themselves retired. They lived in an adult community near Portland, Oregon, owned or were buying a single-family dwelling and were willing to cooperate in the study. The 50 couples were interviewed in their homes during the summer of 1971. The age of the husbands at retirement ranged from 52 to 79 with a mean age of 64. 8. The mean number of year retired was seven. Based on Hollingshead's Two-factor Index of Social Position, all the husbands were from the middle or upper social positions. In 1970, incomes of the couples ranged from 2, 000 to 40, 000 with a median of 8, 400. Their net worth ranged from 23, 000 to over 200, 000 with a median of 80, 000. All couples reported enough income for current needs. Forty-eight couples indicated they had adequate provision for an extended illness and sufficient income to visit children and relatives as often as they wished. Forty-six couples lived close enough to their pre-retirement level of living to please them. Thirty-nine of the couples used a financial plan, but only five couples had made written plans. Most couples based their financial plan on past experiences and adjusted their plan as needs changed. Those with a financial plan usually planned for a month or a longer period. All couples reported some degree of flexibility in their plans. Thirty-eight of the 45 couples who at some time had used a financial plan felt it had been an aid to a higher level-of-living than would have been possible without a plan. The total expenditures of the 50 couples in 1970 ranged from 2, 695 to 20, 264 with a mean of 8, 287. By income level the mean total expenditures were: 4, 255 for the 5, 000 or less income group; 7, 973 for the 5, 001 to 10, 000 group; 10, 753 for the 10, 001 to 15, 000 group; and 13, 570 for the group with income of 15, 001 or more. The expenditures represent <b>dissavings</b> in the two lower income groups in decreasing amounts as income increased. Savings in the two upper income groups increased in amounts as income increased. The mean 1970 expenditures for all couples were: food, 1, 450; housing, 1, 538; transportation, 1, 213; clothing and clothing care, 327; medical, 571; other family consumption, 1, 414; gifts and contributions, 391; life insurance, 224; and personal taxes, 1, 147. When asked about adjustments of expenditures to income, 35 couples reported they had made adjustments to increasing costs in 1970. All couples used their time, energy or skills as substitutes for purchased services. The services performed and named in order of frequency of substitution were: laundering, cleaning, making minor household repairs and doing maintenance work. Ninety-eight percent of the couples found satisfaction in performing these services. Forty-seven of the 50 couples used credit in 1970. Credit cards were used by 40 couples and monthly charge accounts by 24 couples. The items most frequently purchased on credit in 1970 were gas and oil followed by clothing and household items. Only three couples reported financial management problems after retirement. The problems reported were: having children in school after retirement; selling home to buy in a more desirable neighborhood; receiving reduced income from investments; and supporting an aged parent in a nursing home...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a unique}} household-level dataset on the {{situation}} after the Kobe earthquake in 1995, we test the full consumption risk sharing hypothesis, relaxing the separability assumption, and examine households' simultaneous choice of risk coping measures. Using multivariate probit estimations, {{we find that the}} full consumption insurance hypothesis is strongly rejected and our results indicate that households' utility across different expenditure items is not separable. As for households' choice of risk-coping measures, households borrowed extensively against housing damage, but relied on <b>dissaving</b> to cope with smaller asset damage, implying a hierarchy of risk-coping measures from <b>dissaving</b> to borrowing. ...|$|E
40|$|Using {{previously}} unanalyzed Japanese household data, {{this paper}} {{shows that the}} Japanese elderly's age-wealth profile is flat; the elderly are not <b>dissaving.</b> Part {{of the reason for}} the lack of <b>dissaving</b> appears to be the bequest motive, if it can be assumed that the intensity of the bequest motive is stronger if one has more surviving children. The conclusion that the Japanese elderly are not <b>dissaving</b> is based on estimates of the age-wealth profile from a sample of the independent elderly — those elderly who choose not to live with their children or other younger relatives. I perform a test of sample-selectivity bias and show that the age-wealth relation estimated from only the sample of the independent elderly is an unbiased estimate for all of the elderly. In performing this test of sample-selectivity bias, I find that self-employment and rural residential status increases the probability of the elderly's forming an intergenerational household. There is, however, no evidence of intensified competition among a larger number of children to adopt the parents, contradicting the hypothesis of Bernheim, Shleiffer...|$|E
