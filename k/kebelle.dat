50|$|The Foundation of Sawla(Felege Neway)The {{town was}} founded in 1959 {{during the reign of}} Emperor Hayile Silassie. The main factors for its {{foundation}} were its conducive climate and environment, fertile soil, suitability for expansion of infrastructure, the presence of airport at that time, availability of water and different spices including coffee and its importance as business center. In 1963 the Gofa Awuraja has been transferred to Sawla from Bulki and this has played a role for the relative fast infrastructure and structural development of the town. The ancient name of Sawla is Felege Newaye. Sawla town has got its present name from “Sa7a’’ ‘’wula” a Gofa word and which means “the gate of land”. This name was given because Sawla was serving as the center of business for the surrounding districts. In 2002/2003 the Southern Nations Nationality Peoples Regional State Works and Urban Development Bureau study has classified it as one of the city administration in the region Sawla is one of the reform towns in the region and has a municipal status consisting of urban <b>kebelle.</b> and the town got the first plan in 1965. The town has got the current plan in 2002.Records at the Nordic Africa Institute website provide details of the primary and secondary school in Sawla in 1968.

Physical barriers may limit the options, especially in developing countries. A network of villages linked by traders/farmer-traders sharing livestock markets was built with field data collected in 75 villages from 8 <b>kebelles</b> in the Wassona Werna wereda of the Ethiopian Highlands. Two exponential random graph models were fitted with various geographical and demographic attributes of the nodes (dyadic independent model) and three internal network structures (dyadic dependent model). Several diagnostic methods were applied to assess the goodness of fit of the models. The odds of an edge where the distance to the main market Debre Behran and the difference in altitude between two connected villages are both large increases significantly so that villages far away from the main market and at different altitude {{are more likely to be}} linked in the network than randomly. The odds of forming an edge between two villages in Abamote or Gudoberet <b>kebelles</b> are approximately 75 % lower than an edge between villages in any other <b>kebelles</b> (p, 0. 05). The conditional log-odds of two villages forming a tie that is not included in a triangle, a 2 -star or a 3 -star is extremely low, increasing the odds significantly (p, 0. 05) each time a node is in a 2 -star structure and decreasing it when a node is in a 3 -star (p, 0. 05) or in a triangle formation (p, 0. 05)), conditional on the rest of the network.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Babille district, East Hararghe, Ethiopia, a mixed crop-livestock region selected because of its vulnerability to malnutrition. A sample of 400 rural households were drawn randomly from four <b>kebelles</b> in this district. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods were used. The findings indicated that agricultural production was mainly focused on staple food crops such as sorghum and maize, and a limited range of cash crops and animal products for sale. Nutritionally important food types such as vegetables, fruits, beans, eggs and meat were produced only by a minority of households and were largely sold for cash rather than being consumed within the producer household. From a dietary perspective households produced a limited number of food groups. Farming was also the main source of cash income with additional cash income obtained from a range of off-farm and non-farm activities, particularly wage labour, which were particularly important to the poorest households. In terms of food availability, {{more than half of the}} households experienced a food gap during the year, which was worse for female-headed households than their male counterparts; considerable differences was also found across the four <b>kebelles.</b> Diets in the area were dominated by cereals, and consumption of high-value foods such as meat, eggs, fruits, vitamin A-rich vegetables and dark green leafy vegetables was limited to small proportions of households, indicating a severe risk of nutrient deficiencies. Important seasonal differences were found in terms of household food access and dietary diversity between pre-harvest and post-harvest seasons. Regression analysis indicated that households producing diverse crops, with higher farm income, larger landholding size and larger household size had higher dietary diversity. The study concludes that agriculture production contributes positively to dietary diversity through own provision of food and cash income from farming...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of shared}} common water points (WPs) and grazing points (GPs) at two {{different}} levels of administrative aggregation (village and <b>kebelle)</b> in a region of the Highlands of Ethiopia was explored {{by means of a}} questionnaire survey and social network analysis. Despite GPs being more abundant than WPs (208 and 154, respectively), individual GPs provide more contact opportunities for animals. There was great variability in the contact structure of the selected villages within kebelles for both networks, with this variability being higher in the GP networks for each <b>kebelle.</b> Contrary to the commonly held view that WPs are critical for the potential transmission of infectious diseases, intervention at GPs in the Ethiopian Highlands may have greater impact on contacts and thereby opportunities for transmission of infectious diseases between flocks. Some villages appear naturally at much lower risk of introducing disease. These findings could help the design of surveillance and control activities for directly transmitted infectious diseases.

40|$|The dynamic {{interactions}} between society and land resources {{have to be}} taken into account when planning and managing natural resources. A computer model, using STELLA software, was developed through active participation of purposively selected farm households from different wealth groups, age groups and gender within a rural community and some members of <b>Kebelle</b> council. The aim of the modeling was to study the perceived changes in land-use, population and livelihoods over the next 30 years and to improve our understanding of the interactions among them. The modeling output is characterized by rapid population growth, declining farm size and household incomes, deteriorating woody vegetation cover and worsening land degradation if current conditions remain. However, through integrated intervention strategies (including forest increase, micro-finance, family planning, health and education) the woody vegetation cover is likely to increase in the landscape, population growth is likely to slow down and households’ income is likely to improve. A validation assessment of the simulation model based on historical data on land-use and population from 1973 to 2006 showed that the model is relatively robust. We conclude that as a supporting tool, the simulation model can contribute to the decision making process...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the effect of a}} large-scale agricultural investment, namely Bako-Tibe Karuturi Agro Products Plc., on local livelihoods in Ethiopia using quantitative and qualitative analysis. A sample survey of randomly selected 88 households from three <b>kebelles</b> adjacent to the investment and three focus group discussions in each of the <b>kebelles</b> were carried out. Key informant interviews with woreda (district) government officials and qualitative and informal interview with local people were conducted. Available official documents were collected. The study investigated local, socio-economic conditions and rural livelihood imperatives were not taken sufficiently into account when decisions about the investment were taken. The land expropriated for the investment was a ‘rural communal landholding’ vital for communal grazing and forest based economic activities. Parts of the rural communal landholding were used for crop production on individual basis for year with the authorization of local government bodies. Regardless of its use, the communal landholding and parts of it used for crop production were not registered and consequently not eligible for payment of compensation. Stated intentions of the investment included more productive land use, generation of employment and training benefits for the local community and improvement of local social facilities and infrastructures. But the opportunity costs of the investment for the local people seem to be greater than the benefits generated so far. The expropriation of the landholding changed accesses to communal grazing land and water resources for livestock and challenged household irrigation. It has significantly affected forest-based incomes for household consumption and commercial purposes. It affected individual landholdings used for years (but unregistered) and intra-local mobility of the community adjacent to the investment. Though local employment opportunities were created, these consisted of low-paying seasonal jobs and casual labour with no employment security and poor working conditions. Under the current investment agreement and investor’s performance, spillover effects related to improved agricultural production techniques are questionable. Any significant contribution of the investment to local and national food supply seems unlikely. The change of accesses to the local resource base strongly affected local livelihoods options to and income diversification opportunities. Farm income (crop-production and livestock) contributes up to 87 % of total household income. The local households are economically poor - mean per capita income is far less than the national average and more than two-thirds reported a mean annual food supply shortage of 1. 75 months. As a consequence of expropriation of unregistered individual land holdings, inequality in land and wealth distribution, measured through the GINI index, increased by about 4 and 2 percentage points respectively...|$|R

The data were collected by questionnaire, personal observation and interview like composition, marketing channels and purpose of village chicken production. The result of the study revealed that about 80 % of the households kept local chicken, 12 % local and cross breed, and 8 % kept exotic and local breed together. The major sources of parent stock were from market (52 %), research centers (6 %) and hatched in home (42 %). In this study village chicken in the study area become sexual maturity and egg laying first at average 6 1 / 2 months, the average number of clutch /hen/years was 3 and their hatchability was 76 %. 60 % of the household rear their chicken for laying, 26 % for income source and 14 % for consumption.

40|$|This study {{explored}} decentralization {{and rural}} community participation in primary education in three woredas in Horro Gudurru Wollaga Zone of Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. The study has illustrated how communities {{participate in their}} local schools and examined the successes and challenges in the implementation process. The main fieldwork was conducted in July and August 2009. Qualitative research approach was applied and focus group interview, qualitative interview, documents and field observation were used for data collection. The study majorly involved 24 informants that include woreda education officers, headmasters, <b>Kebelle</b> Education and Training Boards, Parent Teacher Associations and community members. The study investigated that the decentralization in education has improved community participation in education. This has improved access and equity in education, sense of community ownership and school level disciplinary problems. Despite these encouraging outcomes, the implementation of decentralization and community participation in education is suffering from many challenges. Poverty {{in the community and}} fluctuation in households’ income were found to affect community capacity to finance schools. The block grant fund for schools was inadequate. Schools have no adequate infrastructure and the existing ones were intended to fix problems quickly and hence are of low quality. The PTA and KETB lack basic knowledge and experience for the position and were not succeeded in performing their functions effectively. These bodies have also limited power over control of teachers and performance of headmasters. Further, there is inequality between localities and weak relationship between actors and sectors. Generally, the decentralization of education and community participation has brought great change in the way a school is financed, but little change in the way a school is managed and educational quality is improved. Hence, the decentralization of education is serving as a tool for lessening state responsibility for provision of education. Moreover, the lack of necessary resource and trained manpower at the local level are potential challenges for the successful implimetation of the decentralization of education and the promotion of community participation and hence for local educational development...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{discusses}} the gender roles in a dairy value at {{the study area}} central zone specifically, rural and urban Woredas of Laelay May chew and rural Adwa and Axum and urban Adwa that is four <b>kebelle</b> from rural /Soloda, Betehans, Sefeho, Hatsebo/ and four <b>kebelle</b> from urban Axum and Adwa respectively; Hawelti, Hayelom and Mebale and Hayelom. The objective of the research is to invest get the gender role at the dairy value chain {{in the study area}} and to access the decision role of both gender on the income of dairy farming and to identify the perception of both gender on the dairy farm activities. The research tried to answer some problems; the first one is to solve the information gap of the study area as there was no related study done on the gender role at dairy farm activity in the study area and the second one is to compare the result of this research finding with the finding of other researchers studied at different areas. The sample design of the research is constructed from both rural and urban dairy farmers, dairy product sellers and buyers, and dairy product consumers, from these the sample size totally 220 and from these 180 from rural and urban dairy farmers and 40 from dairy product traders’ i. e. hotels and cafes the buy and sell milk. This research employed both qualitative and quantitative methods and the data was collected primary and secondary. The primary data were collected using four methods namely survey, key information interview, focus group discussion and method of observation. Both structured and open ended questionnaires, interview checklists and focus group discussion guides were used. The result of the research finding female and male participate at different chain activities. At the input side, purchasing of dairy cows dominated by males as 69. 4 % and 30. 6 % females participated; cleaning of dairy shade female participates 61. 7 %and 55 % at rural and urban respectively, males 38. 3 % and 45 % rural and urban participates respectively. Caring of dairy cow and calves also female 51 % and male 49 % participate; dairy animal feed collection dominated by males 58. 8 % and 41. 2 %are males; watering of dairy animal also dominated by female as 56. 7 % and 55 % at rural and urban respectively and males 43. 3 % and 45 % rural and urban respectively. The production or breeding of dairy animal dominated by males at both study areas i. e. males 71. 6 % and female 28. 4 % were participated. At the process side or milk container cleaning, milk storage and preparation, milking and milk churning dominated by females. The transporting and selling of milk were dominated by male 55 % and female 45 % specifically boys and girls at rural but at urban area 55 % females participate at selling of milk; butter selling dominated by females by 93. 2 %. The thesis also looks at how the society perceives in controlling and benefit from the dairy income and the result is women’s have a culture and belief to control and benefit from the income. Research showed that there are some men who do not do certain activities because of the influence of culture. The thesis also looks at how gender perceives on the role of division on dairy value chain activity proves the previous perception means women engaged in lower level of dairy value chain than males. The research concluded that there is still gender participation difference in activities; women’s are confined at lower level dairy value chain activity which is routine and daily and needs more time and in considerable activities and females dominant at input side value chain and males at production side and both genders’ perception supports this role differences. On the other hand both husband and wife equally decide on how to use and share the income of the dairy farm and women’s are more benefit able from the income. Global Affairs Canad...|$|E
40|$|Though {{exclosure}} {{is sound}} for degraded land rehabilitation, mainly {{due to lack}} of quantitative environmental and socio-economical merits most exclosures are attributed negatively by local people and hence their sustainability left at risk. This study was held to identify and quantify effect of Halla exclosure on environment and its socio-economic contribution to local community at <b>Kebelle</b> Aynibrkekein, Woreda Degua Tembien,Tigray North Ethiopia. To do this, two mountains: closed and non-closed were selected. To measure important parameters of trees and shrubs, herbs and grasses, 8 plots having 10 * 10 m, 4 * 4 m and 1 * 1 m (nested each other) were taken respectively in each mountain. And to assess actual contribution to the local people, 16 households under the closed and 22 under the non-closed were interviewed. On top of this, group discussion was held with focus group. Accordingly, 10 trees & shrubs (Shannon diversity index [H] = 1. 695934422) representing 93 individuals and 11 herbs representing 173 individual were found in the sample plots of the closed whereas 5 trees & shrubs (H = 1. 241125184) representing 41 individual and 7 herbs representing 149 individual were found in the non-closed. Height structure of trees and shrubs at the closed seems like bell shaped being most individuals concentrated to 1 - 2 m while at the non-closed seems like inverted J shape being most individuals concentrated to less than 0. 5 m. Both the closed and the non-closed areas have inverted J shape diameter distribution but in the non-closed, maximum diameter were limited to less than 10 cm while in the closed the range stretched up to 15 cm. The closed area was significantly different over the non-closed in terms of tree and shrubs moist biomass, oven dry biomass, carbon dioxide sequestration, biomass of forage grass, and biomass of thatching grass (p< 0. 05) But not significantly different in terms of herbs moist biomass, oven dry biomass and carbon dioxide sequestration, trees and shrubs canopy coverage, herbs canopy coverage, honey bee flora and cactus fruit availability (p≥ 0. 05). The closed area had 438108 kg moist biomass, 303600 oven dry biomass and 669240 sequestrated carbon dioxide of trees and shrubs, and 165000 kg forage grass, and 132000 kg thatching grass more than the non-closed area. All (16) of the respondents under the closed mountain responded they were getting benefits from the exclosure but under the non-closed, only 8 attributed the non-closed area is giving them some benefits. May using fuel wood from the exclosure is illegal, all respondents, said, they do not use fuel wood from it while 4 respondents under the non-closed said they fetch firewood from the non-closed. 4 respondents under the closure and 3 from the non-closed said their honey production is increasing due to their respective areas but {{at the bottom of the}} exclosure there were two bee keeping enterprises having 93 bee colonies producing about 4525 kg/year but nothing was in the non-closed area. All of the respondents under the exclosure said that they get forage and thatching grass from the exclosure every year. About 13500 kg and 64800 kg forage and thatching grass respectively have been cut per year by the local people but nothing under the non-closed. 10 from the closure and 2 from the nonclosure said their respective areas were contributing to their crop production and 80 % of the respondents under the closure said they got cactus fruits from it but nothing under the non-closed. 65 % respondents under the exclosure identified the exclosure is also giving them environmental benefits such as decreasing erosion and increasing discharging potential of springs and wells whereas under the non-closed area, all except 1 (he said it protects torrential wind) did not attributed environmental benefits from it. In addition the respondents under the closure said they are getting social benefits like job opportunity and they feel proud of having such closure. On contrary the respondents under the non-closed were not attributed social benefits and hence some feel shame and envy of the neighbor’s closure. Although the closure had environmental and socio-economical potential and all the residents under it are getting benefits (though not optimum), most of them were not happy with the benefits because of poor management and immediate benefit needs. 50 % respondents decided to be free accessed for animals and fuel wood. In addition, most of them could not quantify its benefits. Therefore, concerned body should interfere to manage appropriately and to persuade especially to the pessimistic people by giving quantitative evidence of its merits over if it were not closed and this study can be used as base...|$|E

Particularly, female sex workers {{are exposed to the}} risk of unintended pregnancy, abortion and their consequences. The aim of this study was, therefore, to assess unintended pregnancy and associated factors among female sex workers in Mekelle city, northern Ethiopia. METHODS: A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among 346 female sex workers from five <b>Kebelles</b> (smallest administrative units in Ethiopia) of Mekelle city from March-April, 2014. Sex workers were selected with simple random sampling technique using sampling frame obtained from urban health extension program. Epi-data version 3. 1 was used to enter data and analysis was done using SPSS version 20. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify factors associated with unintended pregnancy using odds ratio and 95 % confidence interval with P-value of 0. 05. RESULTS: The magnitude of unintended pregnancy among female sex workers {{in the past two years}} was 28. 6 %. During this period, 59 women had abortion which represents three-fifths, (59. 6 %), of those who had unintended pregnancies, and 17. 1 % of all female sex workers. Female sex workers who gave birth and had history of abortion formerly had 3. 1 (AOR[*]=[*] 3. 07, 95 % CI: [1. 54, 6. 09]) and 15. 6 (AOR[*]=[*] 15. 64 95 % CI: [8. 03, 30. 47]) times higher odds of unintended pregnancy compared to their counterparts, respectively. Sex workers who had steady partners had 2. 9 (AOR[*]=[*] 2. 87, 95 % CI: [1. 47, 5. 61]) times higher odds of have unintended pregnancy than those who hadn't. Drug users had 2. 7 (AOR[*]=[*] 2. 68, 95 % CI: [1. 30, 5. 52]) times higher odds of unintended pregnancy than those who hadn't use. Sex workers who had 60 - 96 months of duration in sex work were 67 % less likely to have unintended pregnancy than those with < 12  months (AOR[*]=[*] 0. 33, 95 % CI: [0. 11, 0. 95]).

40|$|There are two {{different}} types of seed marketing, known as formal and informal (farmers’) seed supply. The formal seed supply sector is not well developed in Ethiopia, it was able to provide only 10 - 20 % of the actual seed demand and the remaining demand has been supplied by the farmers’ seed system. The informal seed system has been contributing a lot for the existence of the majority farmers’ economic performance for many centuries and still offers many opportunities for the seed security of farmers. However, the informal seed system has been performing in Ethiopia in general and Tigray in particular at individual level and not as a business; with almost no attention was given to improve the system through appropriate research and investment. The study therefore was aimed at analyzing the seed marketing challenges and investigates the Opportunities for Local Seed Business Development in Endamekhoni and Atsbiwemberta Weredas of Tigray region, Ethiopia. The study was conducted by collecting data from primary and secondary sources of seed marketing in the region, in three sample <b>Kebelles</b> of Atsibiwemberta and Endamekhoni Wereda, which was selected purposively because of the existence of Local Seed Business development pilot project supportive programme. Using random sampling procedure and probability proportionate to size of the population data has been collected from 147 total farmer respondents, of which 76 from Atsibiwemberta and 81 from Endamekhoni woredas. The data was analyzed using different qualitative and quantitative statistical procedures and methods. Both descriptive statistics like mean, standard deviation, percentage, Chi-square tests and t-test etc and econometric models were employed to study the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. A binary logit model was employed to analyze determinants of farmers’ participation in seed marketing. Sixteen explanatory variables were included in the model of which age of hhh was found negatively influencing whereas hhh’s knowledge, hhh’s access of credit service, cooperative membership of the hhh, and hhh understanding on importance of seed business, and existence of contract seed farming practice in thearea were found significant and positively influencing farmers’ participation in seed marketing. Based on the descriptive statistics, econometric models and focused group discussions results of this study, awareness creation program, managerial and technical capacity building of the seed producer society, seed business oriented extension system designing, community based financial institution establishment, start up capital support and long-term credit access, autonomous cooperative system promotion, link seed producer societies with contract farming and market information systems, support the seed producer societies to establish marketing infrastructure facilities are suggested as potential recommendations to promote sustainable local seed business development in the study areas...|$|R
