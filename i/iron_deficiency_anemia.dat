This {{was part of the}} Rockefeller Foundation's sanitary commission on the island through the International Health Division. Castle's research interest was pernicious <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>anemia,</b> specifically as caused by the parasitic hookworm, which was endemic on the island at rates of 80%, and tropical sprue. An effective treatment for the latter had just been developed, although the disease's causes remained obscure. As recently as 2010, medical journal Nieto Editores reported that these conditions continued to cause high mortality in Puerto Ricans. The cause of tropical sprue has still not been identified, but since the 1940s, it can be treated with folic acid and a 3 to 6-month course of antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeletal}} remains {{of more than}} 100 individuals have been excavated at Iximche, {{some of which were}} very well preserved. Unfortunately the bones became mixed when warehoused near the site after excavation and their original locations are no longer clear. Thirty-six skulls were analysed by archaeologists, of these 25 show evidence of decapitation, a sacrificial practice commonly represented in Maya art from the Classic Period. Thirteen of these sacrifices were male, seven were female and five were of indeterminate gender. Most of the sacrifices were of young adults, ten were aged between 15 and 21 years old and eleven were aged little more than 21 years old, based on skull development. It is likely that these sacrificed individuals were not Kaqchikels but were captives taken from enemy states. Less than 3% of the analysed skulls showed evidence of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>anemia,</b> a very low percentage compared with remains recovered from Copán and Altar de Sacrificios (64% and 88% respectively). This low percentage indicates that these individuals were not exposed to particular dietary stress and were likely to belong to the elite class. 31% of the skulls had evidence of infection, about half of which were active infections at the time of death, although none were serious. Half of these infections left evidence in the maxillary sinus, this suggests a fairly high level of airborne pathogens in the environment. Tooth enamel analysis was carried out on 19 individuals and revealed hypoplasia in the teeth of 89% of these, indicating a high level of poor health in the first 7 years of childhood.|$|E

Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} {{treatment was}} found not to reduce the prevalence of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> or <b>anemia</b> among Alaska Native children at 14 months after treatment initiation. We hypothesized that 14 months was too early to resolveH. pylori–induced gastric damage. Consequently, we conducted a 40 -month follow-up. Methods. We enrolled 219 children 7 – 11 years old who hadH. pylori infection (as diagnosed by 13 C-labeled urea breath test) and <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> (serum ferritin level, 22. 47 pmol/L) in a controlled, household-randomized trial {{of the effect of}} treatment of H. pylori on <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> and <b>anemia</b> (hemoglobin level, 115 g/L). At 40 months, 176 children were evaluated. Results. Forty-four (52 %) of 85 children in the intervention group and 53 (58 %) of 91 in the control group had <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> (adjusted relative risk [ARR], 0. 92 [95 % confidence interval {CI}, 0. 68 – 1. 26]), versus 4 (5 %) and 17 (19 %), respectively, with both <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> and <b>anemia</b> (ARR, 0. 25 [95 % CI, 0. 09 – 0. 73]). Reinfection occurred among 33 (52 %) of 64 children who had cleared their infection.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> without <b>anemia</b> {{is related}} to adverse {{symptoms}} that can be relieved by supplementation. Since a blood donation can induce such an <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency,</b> we investigated the clinical impact of iron treatment after a blood donation. Methods One week after donation, we randomly assigned 154 female donors with <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> without <b>anemia,</b> aged below 50 years, to a four-week oral treatment of ferrous sulfate versus a placebo. The main outcome was {{the change in the}} level of fatigue before and after the intervention. Aerobic capacity, mood disorder, quality of life, compliance and adverse events were also evaluated. Hemoglobin and ferritin were used as biological markers. Results The effect of the treatment from baseline to four weeks of iron treatment was an increase in hemoglobin and ferritin levels to 5. 2 g/L (P P P = 0. 697) or for other outcomes. Compliance and interruption for side effects was similar in both groups. Additionally, blood donation did not induce overt symptoms of fatigue in spite of the significant biological changes it produces. Conclusions These data are valuable as they enable us to conclude that donors with <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> without <b>anemia</b> after a blood donation would not clinically benefit from iron supplementation.

25|$|Untreated iron {{deficiency}} {{can lead to}} {{iron deficiency}} anemia— a common type of anemia. Anemia is a condition characterized by inadequate red blood cells (erythrocytes) or hemoglobin. <b>Iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>anemia</b> occurs when the body lacks sufficient amounts of iron, resulting in reduced production of the protein hemoglobin. Hemoglobin binds to oxygen, thus enabling red blood cells to supply oxygenated blood throughout the body. Children, pre-menopausal women (women of child-bearing age) and people with poor diet are most susceptible to the disease. Most cases of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>anemia</b> are mild, but if not treated can cause problems like fast or irregular heartbeat, complications during pregnancy, and delayed growth in infants and children.|$|E
25|$|<b>Iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>anemia,</b> which {{increases}} in prevalence as kidney function decreases, is especially prevalent in those requiring haemodialysis. It is multifactoral in cause, but includes increased inflammation, reduction in erythropoietin, and hyperuricemia leading to bone marrow suppression.|$|E
25|$|In case of anemia, iron supplementation {{can cause}} relief {{symptoms}} of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>anemia.</b> However, as {{red blood cell}} levels are restored, shortage of other essentials such as folic acid or vitamin B12 may develop, so these might also be supplemented.|$|E

40|$|Iron {{homeostasis}} {{is affected}} by obesity and obesity-related insulin resistance in a many-facetted fashion. On one hand, <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> and <b>anemia</b> are frequent findings in subjects with progressed stages of obesity. This phenomenon has been well studied in obese adolescents, women and subjects undergoing bariatric surgery. On the other hand, hyperferritinemia with normal or mildly elevated transferrin saturation is observed in approximately one-third of patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

40|$|Background: Optimal {{athletic}} performance may be dependent upon an athlete maintaining adequate iron levels through {{the consumption of}} dietary forms of iron and subsequent metabolism. Endurance athletes, especially female distance runners, {{have been identified as}} being at risk for developing <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency.</b> While <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> is treatable, early diagnosis may be delayed if an adequate medical history and evaluation is not conducted. Objective: To describe the evaluation, diagnosis, and comprehensive sports medicine treatment of a collegiate cross-country athlete with a medical diagnosis of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> with <b>anemia</b> and sports-related musculoskeletal pain. Case Description: A 21 -year-old female collegiate crosscountry athlete experienced a decline in her running performance beginning her freshman year of school. She continued to experience degradation in sports performance despite medical intervention. Two-and-a-half years after initially seeking medical attention she was diagnosed with <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> with <b>anemia</b> by a primary care medical doctor. Additionally, the subject required rehabilitation due to the onset of sports-related musculoskeletal symptoms. Outcomes: Comprehensive treatment for this patient consisted of iron supplementation, therapeutic exercises, manual therapy, and modalities. The athlete was able to compete during her entire cross-country season and earn All-American status at the Division-III level. Discussion: Sports medicine professionals must consider <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> as a possible differential diagnosis when evaluating endurance athletes.
