5|$|<b>Industrialists</b> such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Andrew W. Mellon, and Charles M. Schwab {{built their}} {{fortunes}} in Pittsburgh. Also based in Pittsburgh was George Westinghouse, credited with such advancements {{as the air}} brake and founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886). Banks {{played a key role}} in Pittsburgh's development as these <b>industrialists</b> sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. For example, T. Mellon & Sons Bank, founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.|$|E

5|$|Frank was {{introduced}} to Lucille Selig shortly after he arrived in Atlanta.

5|$|The Derwent Valley is {{considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} factory system. The machines developed in the Derwent Valley such as the water frame allowed continuous production. Richard Arkwright's Cromford Mill and the associated workers' settlement provided a template for industrial communities, not just in the valley but internationally. The reason a settlement was built contemporaneously with Cromford Mill was to provide housing for the workers; the only way to secure the labour the mill required was if homes were provided for the labourers and their families. The success of Arkwright's model lead to other <b>industrialists</b> copying him. Entrepreneurs such as Peter Nightingale, Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans founded the settlements of Belper, Milford, and Darley Abbey within the Derwent Valley for their employees. As well as the economic standpoint of ensuring a supply of labour, the <b>industrialists</b> were also concerned for their employees and families and acted {{out of a sense of}} paternalism.|$|E

5|$|The {{first half}} of the 19th century saw {{geological}} and paleontological activity become increasingly well organised with the growth of geologic societies and museums and an increasing number of professional geologists and fossil specialists. Interest increased for reasons that were not purely scientific, as geology and paleontology helped <b>industrialists</b> to find and exploit natural resources such as coal.|$|E
5|$|Tyldesley's first inns {{were the}} Flaming Castle built in 1778 and the Green Dragon of 1781.

5|$|He helped {{establish}} the Academy's Science and Industry Forum, which {{was formed in}} the second year of his leadership in order to improve dialogue between researchers and <b>industrialists.</b> It investigated whether a national science policy should be formulated and led to the eventual creation of the Australian Science and Technology Council. He also laid the foundations of the Australian Biological Resources Study. When his presidency ended in 1969, the Academy founded the Burnet Lecture and Medal, which is the Academy's highest award for biological sciences.|$|E

5|$|Historian Richard Rhodes {{said that}} in his opinion it was already a foregone {{conclusion}} that Oppenheimer would have his security clearance revoked by then AEC chairman Lewis Strauss, regardless of Teller's testimony. However, as Teller's testimony was the most damning, he was singled out and blamed for the hearing's ruling, losing friends due to it, such as Robert Christy, who refused {{to shake his hand}} in one infamous incident. This was emblematic of his later treatment which resulted in his being forced into the role of an outcast of the physics community, thus leaving him little choice but to align himself with <b>industrialists.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1933, {{he became}} {{involved}} in a controversy known as the Business Plot, when he told a congressional committee {{that a group of}} wealthy <b>industrialists</b> were planning a military coup to overthrow Franklin D. Roosevelt, with Butler selected to lead a march of veterans to become dictator, similar to other Fascist regimes at that time. The individuals involved all denied the existence of a plot and the media ridiculed the allegations.

The <b>industrialist</b> is murdered and Jaya Prada also sees Ramesh in her house that same night. Ramesh is dragged to court and is shortly framed for murder. Jaya Prada is upset, and the ill-intentioned relatives start closing their net around her, forcing her to marry Shakti Kapoor (the son of two of the <b>industrialist's</b> relatives). In the meantime, the grief-stricken Ramesh meets another person named Gangu (also Jeetendra) in jail who looks exactly like him.

Bombay Citizens' Committee, an advocacy group of leading Gujarati <b>industrialists</b> lobbied for Bombay's independent status.|$|E
5|$|The Titanics {{passengers}} {{were divided into}} three separate classes, determined {{not only by the}} price of their ticket but by wealth and social class: those travelling in first class, most of them the wealthiest passengers on board, included prominent members of the upper class, businessmen, politicians, high-ranking military personnel, <b>industrialists,</b> bankers, entertainers, socialites, and professional athletes.

5|$|The {{confiscation}} of Jewish property gave Göring {{the opportunity}} to amass a personal fortune. Some properties he seized himself or acquired for a nominal price. In other cases, he collected bribes for allowing others to steal Jewish property.

5|$|There were {{tensions}} between Bute {{and the new}} <b>industrialists</b> around the region, including ironmasters such as John Guest, {{the master of the}} Dowlais Ironworks. Bute was a financial competitor or landlord with many of these men, and keen to drive as good a deal as possible in his negotiations with them. He also had political differences, seeing himself as a benevolent feudal lord in South Wales, and perceiving the local iron-masters as arrogant, power-hungry individuals, abusing their economic power towards communities and workers.|$|E

The highest concentration of his work is found in the Eaton Hall estate and the surrounding villages of Eccleston, Aldford and Pulford.|$|E
5|$|Abir's rubber {{gathering}} practices made it {{the most}} notorious of all the concession companies for human rights abuses in the Congo Free State. Abir was only involved with primary resource gathering and, despite being owned by European <b>industrialists,</b> operated in a style similar to warlords such as Tippu Tip. Abir was supported in its operations by the Free State which required the enormous profits generated to strengthen its control over the country during its formative years. The concession companies gave the Free State the time and revenue required to secure the Congo and to plan a long-term and more stable program of colonisation. Abir ultimately failed as its harvesting process valued high production over sustainability and it doomed to live out its own boom and bust cycle. Despite this the Abir production model {{was used by the}} French government as the basis for its concession system in the French Congo.|$|E
