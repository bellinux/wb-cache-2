We conclude that, in this scenario, differences in the black hole spin can produce power variations of only a few tens at most. However, if the disk is thick such that the jet subtends a narrow solid angle around the polar axis, then the power dependence becomes much steeper, P ∝Ω_H^ 4 or even ∝Ω_H^ 6.
