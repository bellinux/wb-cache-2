5000|$|The CBM-II line uses a {{complicated}} RAM banking scheme. Bank 0 contains the video RAM on P-series machines and is empty on B-series machines. Banks 1-4 contain the main system RAM, with Bank 15 containing the system ROMs, cartridge ROM, I/O registers, video RAM on B-series machines, {{and a small}} amount of RAM to store system variables. BASIC program text is stored in Bank 1. On 128k models, Bank 2 contains all BASIC variables, however on 256k models they're spread out among Banks 2-4. However, unlike the later Commodore 128, the CBM-IIs do not have the system ROMs mapped into banks other than 15, which has very limited program RAM (1k free, plus a 4k expander board could be installed). This meant that software had to include its own OS routines to <b>handle</b> <b>device</b> I/O and interrupts, as {{it is not possible to}} [...] "far call" [...] code across different memory banks. In theory, if Banks 5-14 were filled, up to 1MB of RAM could be installed, but in practice the computer is limited to 256k as the PLA chip does not have enough address lines for it. Passing data between different banks requires use of the register at $0 which selects the banks to be read from and written to via LDA (zero page),X and STA (zero page),Y. The register at $1 selects the bank where the CPU fetches instructions from, which will default to 15 ($F) on power up.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} <b>handle</b> <b>device</b> {{matching}} for analog circuits, some pairs of modules {{need to be}} placed symmetrically {{with respect to a}} common axis. In this paper, we deal with the module placement with symmetry constraints for analog design using the Transitive Closure Graph-Sequence (TCG-S) representation. Since the geometric relationships of modules are transparent to TCG-S and its induced operations, TCG-S has better flexibility than previous works in dealing with symmetry constraints. We first propose the necessary and sufficient conditions of TCG-S for symmetry modules. Then, we propose a polynomialtime packing algorithm for a TCG-S with symmetry constraints. Experimental results show that the TCG-S based algorithm results in the best area utilization. ...|$|E
40|$|Bluetooth is a {{promising}} wireless technology that enables devices to form short-range wireless ad-hoc networks or personal area networks. However, {{formation of the}} scatternet, or a Bluetooth network, {{is one of the}} challenges that needs to be resolved since their performance depends largely on the scatternet topology used. Further, to improve the performance of the scatternet, the energy capability of Bluetooth devices should be utilized to determine their roles in the scatternet with more capable devices performing more demanding roles. We present a distributed scatternet formation algorithm for creating energy-efficient scatternets of height-balanced binary tree topology. We also provide reorganization techniques on these tree scatternets to maintain energy efficiency and <b>handle</b> <b>device</b> arrivals and departures. We present simulation results, conducted using the Blueware simulator, to study and compare the creation and maintanence of our scatternet. ...|$|E
40|$|With {{continued}} CMOS scaling, future shipped hardware will {{be increasingly}} vulnerable to faults and inevitably fail {{in the field for}} a variety of reasons such as aging or wear-out, radiation, infant mortality due to inadequate burn-in, design defects, manufacturing defects, and so on. Further, this reliability threat is expected to pervade even the mainstream computing market, making traditional solutions that involve redundancy in space, time, and/or information too expensive to be broadly deployable. Hence, there is a need for effective in-field reliability solutions that incur low overheads in area, power, and performance and handle multiple sources of errors. This dissertation proposes a low-cost comprehensive reliability solution that detects, diagnoses, and recovers from in-field errors. Our design is based on the following two key observations. (1) Hardware reliability solutions only need to <b>handle</b> <b>device</b> faults that manifest in software. (2) Despite the growing reliability problem, the fault-free operation remains the common case and must be optimized. These insights drive the design of a novel reliability solution that employs near zero overhead “alwayson” monitors to detect hardware faults by watching for anomalous software behavior (called symptoms). After a detection, a potentially expensive diagnosis algorithm is invoked to diagnose the source of the error and ensure full recovery. While the diagnosis may incur high overhead, it is only invoked in the rare cas...|$|E

40|$|Cloud {{services}} can greatly enhance {{the capabilities of}} mobile and smart devices, particularly within the ecosystem of connected home futures. A single device now performs multiple functions: organizing contacts and calendars, playing games, storing sensitive personal and corporate information, and even making phone calls. Mobile devices are currently, largely single-user systems. Despite {{the fact that a}} device can be used for various purposes, the dividing line between data and applications applied in differing domains is poorly defined. Extending such complexities to the cloud raises a host of issues relating to data ownership, cloud centric security modules, data/device centric mobile security solutions, and cloud-centric data management. Device survivability, remote device management, and contextual policy enforcement capabilities can be supported and extended by cloud services. In this paper, our contribution is threefold: firstly, we examine the issues related to mobile/smart devices and cloud services, and present a context-based, dynamic cloud security framework appropriate for connected home ecosystem futures. Secondly, we outline the key requirements for a cloud infrastructure. We outline mechanisms to <b>handle</b> <b>device</b> survivability and continuity in terms of remote back-up, remote wipe and dynamic context-aware cloud-centric smart device solutions. Thirdly, the paper also summarised some of the security threats and presents a design for a dynamic secure cloud resilience framework.

40|$|In {{order to}} <b>handle</b> <b>device</b> {{matching}} in analog circuits, some pairs of modules {{are required to}} be placed symmetrically. This paper addresses this device-level placement problem for analog circuits and our approach can handle symmetry constraint and other placement constraints simultaneously. The problem of placing devices with symmetry constraint has been extensively studied {{but none of the}} previous works has considered symmetry constraint with other placement constraints simultaneously. Instead of handling the constraints by having a penalty term in the cost function to penalize violations, a unified method is proposed that, by adjusting the edge weights in a pair of constraint graphs, can try to satisfy all the placement and symmetry constraints simultaneously in a candidate floorplan solution. The maximum distance of the modules in a symmetry group from the corresponding symmetry axis will be minimized in this weight adjusting step, in order to minimize the total packing area. We have compared our method with the most updated results on this problem [2] when there are only symmetry constraints and results show that our approach can give solutions of better quality, in an acceptable amount of run time. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling different types of constraints simultaneously by testing on data sets with both symmetry and other placement constraints, and the results are very promising...|$|E

Soft robots compete in DARPA Robotic challenge where humanoid robots attempted to execute operations, in a simulated and real scenarios, WALK-man by IIT and University of Pisa, but are also used in industry, ABB company introduced a new soft gripper to handle fragile things. The Soft Robotics certainly has potential but also posed new challenges at planning and control level, researchers propose different approaches to solve problem but, at moment, it represent an open issue. In this thesis we investigated one of most interesting rising approach take advantage of softness which regard the exploitation of environment constrain (EC) like an help on performing grasp and/or manipulation tasks. We designed a Pick 'n Place manipulator composed of Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSA) and an end-effector call Pisa/IIT SoftHand, an underactuated anthropomorphic hand with 19 DOF but only one motor. Moreover we provide a three-dimensional depth sensor mounted on top of mechanical structure which gives us geometry of actual scene.

40|$|Prevention of {{insufficient}} posture {{by early}} diagnosis can both prevent physical problems {{and secure the}} psychical develpoment of a child. For the diagnosis of insufficient posture is the so called “Matthiass-test” the most used one. Like any other physical examination {{it depends on the}} examinators subjective judgement. So far no easy to <b>handle</b> <b>device</b> exists which can measure objectively and metrical the posture and its change during the Matthiass-test. To change this unsatisfactory situation the apparatus L. A. S. A. R. -Posture from the firm Otto Bock was tested for its exactness in diagnosis of posture. The L. A. S. A. R. -Posture device raises a perpendicular through the centre of gravity of a person and measures the distance of certain points of the body to the perpendicular and to each other. In this way 145 children aged 6 to 17 years were examined for the distance of the shoulder centre, the major trochanter femoris and the lateral ankle and the changing of these points during the Matthiass-test. For reasons of comparison the same children were first examined in the traditional physical way and divided up into groups of healthy children, children with a I° insufficiency and children of a II° insufficiency. The result was that there were differences between these groups regarding the intensity of the points placing and displacing. The great trochanter femoris of the children with II° insufficiency was at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the test always in front of the gravity perpendicular in contrast to the other children. He displaced to ventral in all three groups. Among all children the centre of the shoulder was found in front of the ankle and in the back of the gravity perpendicular, but in the group of the healthy children the shoulder was more ventral. She was displaced to the back in all three groups but with greater intensity in the group of II° insufficienty. As a result of the displacing of the trochanter to ventral and of the shoulder to the back there was a gravity perpendicular which changed barely during the test and was found always in front of the ankle. Although these differences between the three groups were significant there were still standard deviations which were not clearly distinct from each other. Therefore it was impossible to determine or classify the children by the results of their measurement. As a conclusion the use of the apparatus L. A. S. A. R. -Posture to diagnose an insufficient posture without further measurements cannot be recommended at the moment...|$|E

40|$|With {{an aging}} {{population}} {{there is a growing}} need to assist people with disabilities. Particularly crucial is assisting people who cannot stand between positions necessary for everyday living, such as from a wheelchair to the toilet. It is unsafe to transfer people with direct manual techniques, thus a patient <b>handling</b> <b>device</b> is required. To reduce the burden on the healthcare system it is beneficial for disabled people to be cared for in-home. Many in-home caregivers may be physically impaired, thus patient <b>handling</b> <b>devices</b> for this use must require as little effort as possible. This thesis found that existing manual patient <b>handling</b> <b>devices</b> contained significant weaknesses when used for in-home care and there is potential to improve upon them.
