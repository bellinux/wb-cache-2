500|$|In March 2013, Black {{stated that}} Downey's {{original}} contract with Marvel Studios, which expired {{after the release}} of Iron Man 3, may be extended in order for the actor to appear in a second Avengers film and at least one more Iron Man film. He said: [...] "There {{has been a lot of}} discussion about it: 'Is this the last Iron Man for Robert ?' Something tells me that it will not be the case, and [...] will be seen in a fourth, or fifth." [...] In April 2013, Cheadle stated that Iron Man 3 could be the final film in the series, saying, [...] "The door is always left open in these kinds of movies especially when they do as well as they have done. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> talk of making sure we did this one right, and if it worked it could be the last one. There's room for more to be done with these characters. We're getting to a sweet spot with Tony and Rhodey, anyway." [...] In September 2014, in regards to a fourth film, Downey said, [...] "There isn't one in the pipe ... No, there's no plan for a fourth Iron Man." [...] Despite this, in April 2016, Downey stated that he was open to reprising his role in a potential fourth Iron Man film, saying [...] "I feel like I could do one more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pajo denied Corgan's accusations in {{the same}} article. [...] "Pretty much {{everything}} that he said has been exaggerated and blown out of proportion," [...] he said. [...] "The drug stuff in particular. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no heroin." [...] Adds Lenchantin, [...] "I believe that we were a really good team. I am moving on and onward. I hope that our paths will meet again in peace." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't want {{to refuse}} her. I don't want even to seem heartless. I understand, of course, {{she has a}} sort of claim." [...] She sobbed her {{reluctant}} admission. [...] "I know it. <b>I</b> <b>know....</b> <b>There</b> <b>was</b> much between them." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a chuckle}} {{back of her}} eyes, for all their innocence. Everybody shouted. Brother Seguin was nettled, and asked brusquely: ...|$|R

6000|$|He smiled, such a soft, smooth, diabolical {{smile that}} <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> some trick behind his smoothness. He said, [...] "And your baggage?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but there}} is!" [...] said Harry in a {{tremendous}} tone; and as Miss Fosbrook {{held up her}} hands, [...] "at least there was one in the Black Sea; and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a battle in the newspaper--at least, Mr. Carey read about Palermo." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{turn to look}} at 'im," [...] he said bluntly. [...] "I could 'ear 'is voice plain enough--so {{why should}} I take a look at 'im?

6000|$|... "No, Tell," [...] said Gessler, [...] "I cannot {{take that}} answer as the truth. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> some other meaning {{in what you}} did.

6000|$|... "Ay, but," [...] said Tom, whose {{mind was}} prone to see an {{opposition}} between statements that were really accordant,--"but {{there was a big}} flood once, when the Round Pool was made. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was,</b> 'cause father says so. And the sheep and cows all drowned, and the boats went all over the fields ever such a way." ...|$|E
6000|$|I was {{a little}} alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his {{concluding}} exclamation, but said as calmly as I could, [...] "What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred as much from {{the simple fact of}} the accident." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is," [...] said my grandmother, [...] "Sister Hagar, of the House of Martha. She was Sylvia Raynor, of New Haven. I {{think that}} in some way her life has been darkened. Mother Anastasia takes a great {{interest}} in her, and favors her a good deal. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> opposition to her entering the House, but she was determined to do it.

I do not recall much about it, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a scene last night over those cursed cards. A weakness overtakes me sometimes. I will say no more, except that you, {{who are also}} a man who perhaps have felt weaknesses {{of one sort or}} another, will, I hope, make allowances for me and pay no attention to anything that I may have said or done in the presence of guests; yes, that is what pains me--in the presence of guests." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I stated to Mr. Sapsea, when {{we waited}} on him,’ said Jasper: as {{he really had}} done: ‘that there was no quarrel or {{difference}} between the two young men at their last meeting. We all know that their first meeting was unfortunately very far from amicable; but all went smoothly and quietly when they were last together at my house. My dear boy was not in his usual spirits; he was depressed—I noticed that—and I am bound henceforth to dwell upon the circumstance the more, now that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a special reason for his being depressed: a reason, moreover, which may possibly have induced him to absent himself.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That wish is very wrong, Charley," [...] said Grandfather. [...] "You {{must not}} {{think that there is}} no {{integrity}} and honor except among those who stood up for the freedom of America. For aught <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> quite as much of these qualities on one side as on the other. Do you see nothing admirable in a faithful adherence to an unpopular cause? Can you not respect that principle of loyalty which made the royalists give up country, friends, fortune, everything, rather than be false to their king? It was a mistaken principle; but many of them cherished it honorably, and were martyrs to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You poor baby," [...] she cried. [...] "Was {{that what}} was on your mind, {{wondering}} how you should tell me? <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> something troubling you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, Master Ned, I was {{swabbing}} my own eyes; for it ain't in a man's {{nature to}} see a woman suffering like that, and so quiet and brave, without feeling somehow {{as if all the}} manliness had gone out of him. I could not say nothing. What could I say, knowing what the truth was? Then she burst out a-crying and a-sobbing, and I steals off without a word, and goes on deck and sets the men a-hauling at the sheets and trimming the sails, till <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not one of them but cussed me in his heart and wished that the captain was back again.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{called me}} a delectable old fraud, with his arm on my {{shoulder}} while he did it. Why, steward, I had come to love that young man like a splendid son. And with his arm on my shoulder, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> more than mere kindness in it, he told me we had barely reached the River Plate when he discovered me. With laughter, and {{with more than one}} slap of {{his hand on my shoulder}} that was more caress than jollity, he pointed out the discrepancies in my tale (which I have since amended, steward, thanks to him, and amended well), and told me that the voyage had been a grand success, making him eternally my debtor.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's interesting, isn't it, sir," [...] says Barnes, {{turning to}} the Colonel, [...] "to see such union in families? Whenever I come here, my aunt trots out all my relations; and I send a man round in the mornin to ask how they all are. So Uncle Hobson is gone to bed sick with a hookah? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a deuce of a row made when I smoked at Marblehead. You are promised to us for Wednesday, please. Is there anybody {{you would like to}} meet? Not our friend the Rummun? How the girls crowd round him! By Gad, a fellow who's rich in London may have the pick of any gal--not here--not in this sort of thing; I mean in society, you know," [...] says Barnes confidentially, [...] "I've seen the old dowagers crowdin round that fellow, and the girls snugglin up to his india-rubber face. He's known to have two wives already in India; but, by Gad, for a settlement, I believe some of 'em here would marry--I mean of the girls in society." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{some who}} cannot sympathise with such sentiments of limitation; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some who would feel no {{touch of the}} heroic {{tenderness}} if some day a young man, with red hair, large ears, and his mother's lozenges in his pocket, were found dead in uniform in the passes of the Vosges. But on this subject I have heard many philosophies and thought {{a good deal for}} myself; and the conclusion I have come to is Sacrarterumbrrar pour la Pattie, and it is not likely that I shall alter it now.|$|R
