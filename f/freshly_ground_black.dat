50|$|Inhalation of <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz, when {{compared}} to inhalation of aged quartz, results in {{a significant increase in}} animal lung injury. <b>Freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz has increased reactive silicon-based oxygen radicals, and animals that are exposed to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz have been found to have decreased concentrations of antioxidant enzymes. Activated quartz particles decay with age in ambient air. Quartz dusts containing surface iron as an impurity have been shown to deplete cellular glutathione, contributing to the oxidative damage that is caused by particle and cell-derived ROS. Castranova et al. suggest that <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> quartz dust that is contaminated with trace levels of iron may be more pathogenic than quartz dust alone.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{test whether}} or not dentin desensitizing or sealing methods {{influence}} the bond strength of universal resin cements. Materials and Methods: The bond strength of two universal resin cements (RelyXUnicem, Self-adhesive Prototype Cement) to human dentin was assessed after different dentin surface treatments (test). A conventional resin cement (Panavia 21) served as control. The influence of the following pretreatment methods was tested and compared to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin: dentin desensitizing by means of glutaraldehyde-containing primers (Gluma Desensitizer, Syntac Primer/Adhesive), or dentin sealing by means of bonding agents (Heliobond, ClearfilSE Bond). Additionally, the influence of provisional cement (Freegenol) was analyzed after its application and subsequent mechanical removal. Bond strength after thermocycling was measured in a shear test (n = 10). Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA, followed by a post-hoc Tukey test (p < 0. 05). Results: Both test cements exhibited significantly lower bond strength to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin than the control cement. The desensitization methods {{did not affect the}} bond strength of the test cements. Furthermore, the sealing methods significantly increased the bond strength of both test cements as compared to <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin. The application and subsequent removal of the provisional cement only had a minor influence on the bond strength of the test cements. The contamination with provisional cement, however, significantly affected the bond strength of the control cement compared to the values achieved on <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> dentin. Conclusion: Desensitization or sealing of dentin have a beneficial effect on the bond strength of universal resin cements. The application of a provisional cement prior to adhesive cementation exhibits no significant influence on the bond strength of the universal resin cements...|$|R

30|$|Based on Figure  6 and the OSEE results displayed, we {{infer that}} OSEE {{investigations}} allow for differentiating {{two types of}} steel and their respective surface states since as-received or <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> SAE 1008 / 1010 steel shows different OSEE signals than as-received or <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> steel 1.4301. In detail, in both of the investigated surface states the steel SAE 1008 / 1010 shows a higher signal than the steel 1.4301. And for both types of steel we observe a clearly increased electron emission {{as a consequence of}} the grinding process. These findings may be related to the SEM, EDX and XPS results presented in Figure  4 and in Tables  1 and 2, respectively. These investigations show that the grinding process results in strong changes of the structure and the composition of the substrate surface, and the XPS investigations indicate that exposure of <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> substrates of steel 1.4301 results in changes of the surface composition and, especially, in an increased thickness of the reaction layer on top of the surface. Consequently, we applied OSEE to characterize the surface state of <b>freshly</b> <b>ground</b> steel substrates during continued exposure in dry air. The obtained results are displayed in Figure  7 for the steel samples of type SAE 1008 / 1010 and 1.4301, respectively. Coarsely speaking, the OSEE signal significantly decreases during at least one hour for both types of steel, according to a first regime of substrate behaviour. After this phase - in a second regime of substrate behaviour - for two hours no significant change of the OSEE signals is detected. A graphical evaluation determining the intersection of both of these regimes for both types of steels reveals that the OSEE signal of steel 1.4301 reaches the second regime significantly earlier than the OSEE signal of SAE 1008 / 1010 steel. This observation indicates that the time span for reaching the intersection is material-dependent.|$|R
