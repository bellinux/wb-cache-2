50|$|In the {{mammalian}} respiratory system, eupnea or <b>eupnoea</b> is normal, good, unlabored breathing, sometimes {{known as}} quiet breathing or resting respiratory rate. In eupnea, expiration employs only the elastic recoil of the lungs.|$|E
40|$|In some anaesthetized preparations, <b>eupnoea</b> is {{eliminated}} following a blockade or destruction of neurons in a rostral medullary pre-Bötzinger complex. Neurons {{in this region}} might underlie the neurogenesis of <b>eupnoea,</b> or {{be the source of}} an input which is necessary for <b>eupnoea</b> to be expressed. If the latter, any apnoea following ablation of the pre-Bötzinger complex might be reversed by an augmentation in ‘tonic input. ’ Contrariwise, this apnoea should be permanent if the neuronal activities of the pre- Bötzinger complex are an exclusive generator of the eupnoeic rhythm. Decerebrate, vagotomized, paralysed and ventilated adult rats were studied. Efferent activity of the phrenic nerve was recorded as an index of ventilatory activity. Blockade or destruction of neuronal activities of the pre-Bötzinger complex by unilateral and/or bilateral injections of muscimol or kainic acid eliminated <b>eupnoea</b> only transiently. <b>Eupnoea</b> returned following activation of the peripheral chemoreceptors and spontaneously over time. Results do not support the concept that neuronal activities of the pre-Bötzinger complex play an exclusive role in the neurogenesis of <b>eupnoea</b> in vivo. Rather, these neuronal activities appear to provide a tonic input to the ponto-medullary circuit which generates <b>eupnoea</b> and/or appear to be one component of this circuit...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{similarities}} between properties of gasping and the aspiration reflex, {{we hypothesized that}} this reflex activates the central pattern generator for gasping. To evaluate this hypothesis, we have analysed high-frequency oscillations in phrenic and hypoglossal neural activities. These oscillations, analysed by power and coherence spectra, are considered as signatures of the central pattern generators for automatic ventilatory activity. In decerebrate, vagotomized, paralysed and ventilated cats, the aspiration reflex was elicited in <b>eupnoea</b> and gasping by mechanical stimulation of the pharynx and electrical stimulation of the glossopharyngeal nerve. Compared with eupnoeic values, the peaks in the power spectra occurred at higher frequencies in spontaneous gasping. Peaks in the coherence spectra showed identical changes. Power and coherence spectra of inspiratory neural activities during the aspiration reflex differed markedly from those of <b>eupnoea,</b> but {{were similar to those}} in gasping. We conclude that mechanical stimulation of the pharynx or electrical stimulation of the glossopharyngeal nerve activates a reflex by which the central pattern generator for <b>eupnoea</b> is depressed, and that for gasping is activated. Our results also support the concept that separate brainstem mechanisms generate ventilatory activity in <b>eupnoea</b> and gasping. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Sleep unmasks {{a highly}} {{sensitive}} hypocapnia-induced apnoeic threshold, whereby apnoea is initiated by small transient reductions in arterial CO 2 pressure (PaCO 2) below <b>eupnoea</b> and respiratory rhythm is not restored until PaCO 2 has risen significantly above eupnoeic levels. We {{propose that the}} ‘CO 2 reserve’ (i. e. the difference in PaCO 2 between <b>eupnoea</b> and the apnoeic threshold (AT)), when combined with ‘plant gain’ (or the ventilatory increase required for a given reduction in PaCO 2) and ‘controller gain’ (ventilatory responsiveness to CO 2 above <b>eupnoea)</b> are the key determinants of breathing instability in sleep. The CO 2 reserve varies inversely with both plant gain and {{the slope of the}} ventilatory response to reduced CO 2 below eupnoea; it is highly labile in non-random eye movement (NREM) sleep. With many types of increases or decreases in background ventilatory drive and PaCO 2, the slope of the ventilatory response to reduced PaCO 2 below <b>eupnoea</b> remains unchanged from control. Thus, the CO 2 reserve varies inversely with plant gain, i. e. it is widened with hyperventilation and narrowed with hypoventilation, regardless of the stimulus and whether it acts primarily at the peripheral or central chemoreceptors. However, there are notable exceptions, such as hypoxia, heart failure, or increased pulmonary vascular pressures, which all increase the slope of the CO 2 response below <b>eupnoea</b> and narrow the CO 2 reserve despite an accompanying hyperventilation and reduced plant gain. Finally, we review growing evidence that chemoreceptor-induced instability in respiratory motor output during sleep contributes significantly to the major clinical problem of cyclical obstructive sleep apnoea...|$|E
40|$|This study {{addressed}} {{the hypothesis that}} ventrolateral medullary respiratory neurones participate in the control of laryngeal motoneurones during both <b>eupnoea</b> and coughing. Data were obtained from 28 mid-collicular decerebrated, artificially ventilated cats. Cough-like motor patterns (fictive cough) in phrenic, lumbar and recurrent laryngeal nerves were elicited by mechanical stimulation of the intrathoracic trachea. Microelectrode arrays were used to monitor simultaneously several neurones in the ventral respiratory group, including the Bötzinger and pre-Bötzinger complexes. Spike trains were evaluated for responses during fictive cough and evidence of functional connectivity with spike-triggered averages of efferent recurrent laryngeal nerve activity. Primary features were observed in averages triggered by 94 of 332 (28 %) neurones. An offset biphasic wave with a positive time lag was present in the unrectified average for 10 inspiratory and 13 expiratory neurones. These trigger neurones were respectively identified as inspiratory laryngeal motoneurones with augmenting, decrementing, plateau and ‘other’ discharge patterns, and expiratory laryngeal motoneurones with decrementing firing patterns. Rectified averages triggered by inspiratory neurones included 37 offset peaks, 11 central peaks and one offset trough. Averages triggered by expiratory neurones had 12 offset peaks, six central peaks and four offset troughs. Relationships inferred from these features included premotor actions of inspiratory neurones with augmenting, decrementing, plateau and ‘other’ patterns on inspiratory laryngeal motoneurones, and premotor actions of decrementing and ‘other’ expiratory neurones on expiratory laryngeal motoneurones. Corresponding changes in neuronal firing patterns during fictive cough supported these inferences. The data confirm and extend previous results on the control of laryngeal motoneurones during <b>eupnoea</b> and {{support the hypothesis that}} the same premotor neurones help to shape motoneurone firing patterns during both <b>eupnoea</b> and coughing...|$|E
40|$|We {{utilized}} a chronically tracheostomized, unanaesthetized dog {{model to}} study the reflex effects on inspiratory motor output of low-amplitude, high-frequency pressure oscillations (HFPOs) applied to the isolated upper airway (UA) during stable non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. HFPOs (30 Hz and ± 2 to ± 4 cmH 2 O) were applied via a piston pump during <b>eupnoea,</b> inspiratory resistive loading and tracheal occlusion. When applied to the patent UA during expiration, and especially during late expiration, HFPOs prolonged expiratory time (TE) and tonically activated the genioglossus muscle EMG. When applied to the patent UA during inspiration, HFPOs caused tonic activation of the genioglossus muscle EMG and inhibition of inspiratory motor output by either: (a) a shortening of inspiratory time (TI), as inspiration was terminated coincident {{with the onset of}} HFPOs; or (b) a prolonged TI accompanied by a decreased rate of rise of diaphragm EMG and rate of fall of tracheal pressure. These effects of HFPOs were observed during <b>eupnoea</b> and inspiratory resistive loading, but were maximal during tracheal occlusion where the additional inhibitory effects of lung inflation reflexes were minimized. During <b>eupnoea,</b> topical anaesthesia of the UA abolished the HFPO-induced prolongation of TE, suggesting that the response was mediated primarily by mechanoreceptors close to the mucosal surface; whereas the TE-prolonging effects of a sustained square wave of negative pressure (range, - 4 · 0 to - 14 · 9 cmH 2 O) sufficient to close the airway were preserved following anaesthesia. These results demonstrate that high-frequency, low-amplitude oscillatory pressure waves in the UA, similar to those found in snoring, produce reflex inhibition of inspiratory motor output. This reflex may help maintain UA patency by decreasing the collapsing pressure generated by the inspiratory pump muscles and transmitted to the UA...|$|E
30|$|General {{clinical}} examination documented the following findings: The patient suffered from vertigo after getting up fastly and dyspnea during physical exercise. His skin color was rather pale. There was no edema of his legs, and no nycturia was reported. Blood {{pressure of the}} right arm was about 130 / 65  mmHg, and 140 / 65  mmHg of the right leg. There was a heart rate around 90 heartbeats (hb) per minute. Nutritional and general conditions were normal. Transcutaneous oxygen saturation was about 100 % and breathing was normal with <b>eupnoea.</b> There were no suspicious breathing sounds of the lungs. The peripheral pulse status was normal.|$|E
40|$|Apnoea {{and diving}} induce {{autonomic}} cardiovascular responses of bradycardia and blood flow redistribution toward vital organs that {{are aimed at}} improving subject survival in hypoxic conditions. Among factors that influence autonomic nervous activity, and thus affect cardiovascular responses, cigarette smoking is known to reduce vagal cardiac-nerve activity and to increase sympathetic nervous activity. In this study we have assessed the bradycardia response to apnoea and to diving in human smokers. By recording electrocardiograms, heart rate (HR) was monitored on ten healthy habitual smokers (SM) and ten non-smokers (non-SM), in <b>eupnoea,</b> in air, and in simulated diving (facial immersion in water, 22 °C). The latter two conditions included apnoea and snorkelling sessions lasting 30 s each. Apnoea in air induced a 3...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRett {{syndrome}} is a neurodevelopmental disease accompanied by complex, disabling symptoms, including breathing symptoms. Because Rett {{syndrome is}} caused by mutations in the transcriptional repressor methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP 2), Mecp 2 -deficient mice have been generated as experimental model. Males of Mecp 2 -deficient mice (Mecp 2 (-/y)) breathe normally at birth but show abnormal respiratory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia from postnatal day 25 (P 25). After P 30, Mecp 2 (-/y) mice develop breathing symptoms reminiscent of Rett syndrome, aggravating until premature death at around P 60. Using plethysmography, we analyzed the sighs and the post-sigh breathing pattern of unrestrained wild type male mice (WT) and Mecp 2 (-/y) mice from P 15 to P 60. Sighs are spontaneous large inspirations known to prevent lung atelectasis and to improve alveolar oxygenation. However, Mecp 2 (-/y) mice show early abnormalities of post-sigh breathing, with long-lasting post-sigh apnoeas, reduced tidal volume when <b>eupnoea</b> resumes and lack of post-sigh bradypnoea which develop from P 15, aggravate with age and possibly contribute to breathing symptoms to come...|$|E
40|$|The muscular-hydrostat {{model of}} tongue {{function}} proposes a constant interaction of extrinsic (external bony attachment, insertion into base of tongue) and intrinsic (origin and insertion within the tongue) tongue muscles in all tongue movements (22). Yet, research that examines the respiratory-related effects of tongue function in mammals continues to focus {{almost exclusively on}} the respiratory control and function of the extrinsic tongue protrusor muscle, m. genioglossus. The respiratory control and function of the intrinsic tongue muscles are unknown. Our purpose {{was to determine if}} intrinsic tongue muscles have a respiration-related activity pattern and whether intrinsic tongue muscles are co-activated with extrinsic tongue muscles in response to respiratory-related sensory stimuli. Esophageal pressure and electromyographic (EMG) activity of an extrinsic tongue muscle (hyoglossus, HG), an intrinsic tongue muscle (superior longitudinal, SL) and an external intercostal muscle (IIC) were studied in anaesthetized, tracheotomized, spontaneously breathing rats. Mean inspiratory EMG activity was compared at five levels of inspired CO 2. Intrinsic tongue muscles were often quiescent during <b>eupnoea</b> but active during hypercapnia whereas extrinsic tongue muscles wer...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} baroreflex-induced sympathetic activation, produced by lower body negative pressure (LBNP) at − 40 mmHg, on cerebrovascular responsiveness to hyper- and hypocapnia in healthy humans. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound {{was used to measure}} blood flow velocity (CFV) in the middle cerebral artery during variations in end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PET,CO 2) of + 10, + 5, 0, − 5, and − 10 mmHg relative to <b>eupnoea.</b> The slopes of the linear relationships between PET,CO 2 and CFV were computed separately for hyper- and hypocapnia during the LBNP and no-LBNP conditions. LBNP decreased pulse pressure, but did not change mean arterial pressure. LBNP evoked an increase in ventilation that resulted in a 9 ± 2 mmHg decrease in PET,CO 2, which was corrected by CO 2 supplementation of the inspired air. LBNP did not affect cerebrovascular CO 2 response slopes during steady-state hypercapnia (3. 14 ± 0. 24 vs. 2. 96 ± 0. 26 cm s− 1 mmHg− 1) or hypocapnia (1. 31 ± 0. 18 vs. 1. 32 ± 0. 19 cm s− 1 mmHg− 1), or the CFV responses to voluntary apnoea (+ 51 ± 19 vs. + 50 ± 18 %). Thus, cerebrovascular CO 2 responsiveness was not altered by baroreflex-induced sympathetic activation. Our data challenge the concept that sympathetic activation restrains cerebrovascular responses to alterations in CO 2 pressure...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the effects of the}} passage of air and of instillation of hyperosmolal solutions in a segment of trachea of the pentobarbitone-anaesthetized cat on the release of radiolabelled mucus glycoproteins (mucins) into that segment. Ambient air passed through the segment at 11 min- 1 increased the output of both 35 S- and 3 H-labelled mucins. It also stimulated the output of mucins measured chemically. Passage of ambient air warmed to body temperature caused a similar effect on the output of radiolabelled mucins unless the air had also been saturated with water vapour at that temperature. Instillation of cold Krebs-Henseleit solution into the tracheal segment had no effect on the release of radiolabelled mucins. The action of warmed dry air persisted after extrinsic nerves (sympathetic and parasympathetic) to the trachea had been cut. Hyperosmolal solutions placed in the tracheal segment also increased the output of both 35 S- and 3 H-labelled mucins. We conclude that passage of ambient air through the trachea of the cat increases mucin output. This is probably by its drying action rather than by the mechanical disturbance from the flow or by cooling. The response might occur during <b>eupnoea</b> but {{is more likely to be}} important during hyperpnoea such as occurs during exercise. We discuss the relevance of the response to exercise-induced asthma...|$|E
40|$|The {{activation}} of the levator costae, a set of axial muscles inserted between each rib and the vertebra immediately rostral, has been studied electromyographically in a human subject, standing upright, with head erect ('neutral' posture). Caudal levator costae muscles (T 9, and T 10) are active during <b>eupnoea.</b> Periodic activity in phase with inspiration occurs in admixture with different levels of tonic activity that is strongly influenced by posture. Postural changes and various voluntary respiratory manoeuvres which should lengthen or shorten the levator costae muscles increase and decrease, respectively, their activity in the 'neutral' posture. The tonic activity was most readily enhanced by contralateral flexion of the spine, and this could bring to threshold phasic activity not otherwise present. Conversely, ipsilateral flexion could abolish both phasic and tonic components. Active expiratory efforts and static voluntary relaxation of the respiratory muscles could diminish or abolish levator costae activity. Paradoxically, chest-directed inspiratory efforts maintained at elevated lung volume with open glottis could also diminish or abolish levator costae activity. We attribute this to shortening of the levator costae muscles and unloading of their muscle spindles by the elevation of the ribs due to {{the action of the}} external intercostal and parasternal muscles. The results are discussed in relation to the mechanical coupling between the diaphragm and the lower rib cage; emphasis is given to the possible independent motions of the lower two or three ribs and the abductor action of their corresponding levator costae muscles, based on anatomico-physiological considerations...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that reflexes arising from working respiratory muscle can elicit increases in sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow to limb skeletal muscle, in seven healthy human subjects at rest. We measured muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) with intraneural electrodes in the peroneal nerve while the subject inspired (primarily with the diaphragm) against resistance, with mouth pressure (PM) equal to 60 % of maximal, a prolonged duty cycle (TI/TTot) of 0. 70, breathing frequency (fb) of 15 breaths min− 1 and tidal volume (VT) equivalent to twice <b>eupnoea.</b> This protocol was known to reduce diaphragm blood flow and cause fatigue. MSNA was unchanged during the first 1 – 2 min but then increased over time, to 77 ± 51 % (s. d.) greater than control at exhaustion (mean time, 7 ± 3 min). Mean arterial blood pressure (+ 12 mmHg) and heart rate (+ 27 beats min− 1) also increased. When the VT, fb and TI/TTot of these trials were mimicked with no added resistance, neither MSNA nor arterial blood pressure increased. MSNA and arterial blood pressure also did not change in response to two types of increased central respiratory motor output that did not produce fatigue: (a) high inspiratory flow rate and fb without added resistance; or (b) high inspiratory effort against resistance with PM of 95 % maximal, TI/TTot of 0. 35 and fb of 12 breaths min− 1. The heart rate increased by 5 – 16 beats min− 1 during these trials. Thus, {{in the absence of}} any effect of increased central respiratory motor output per se on limb MSNA, we attributed the time-dependent increase in MSNA during high resistance, prolonged duty cycle breathing to a reflex arising from a diaphragm that was accumulating metabolic end products in the face of high force output plus compromised blood flow...|$|E
40|$|We {{recently}} {{showed that}} fatigue of the inspiratory muscles via voluntary efforts caused a time-dependent increase in limb muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) (St Croix et al. 2000). We now asked whether limb muscle vasoconstriction and reduction in limb blood flow also accompany inspiratory muscle fatigue. In six healthy human subjects at rest, we measured leg blood flow () in the femoral artery with Doppler ultrasound techniques and calculated limb vascular resistance (LVR) while subjects performed {{two types of}} fatiguing inspiratory work {{to the point of}} task failure (3 – 10 min). Subjects inspired primarily with their diaphragm through a resistor, generating (i) 60 % maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (PM) and a prolonged duty cycle (TI/TTOT = 0. 7); and (ii) 60 % maximal PM and a TI/TTOT of 0. 4. The first type of exercise caused prolonged ischaemia of the diaphragm during each inspiration. The second type fatigued the diaphragm with briefer periods of ischaemia using a shorter duty cycle and a higher frequency of contraction. End-tidal PCO 2 was maintained by increasing the inspired CO 2 fraction (FI,CO 2) as needed. Both trials caused a 25 – 40 % reduction in diaphragm force production in response to bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation. and LVR were unchanged during the first minute of the fatigue trials in most subjects; however, subsequently decreased (- 30 %) and LVR increased (50 – 60 %) relative to control in a time-dependent manner. This effect was present by 2 min in all subjects. During recovery, the observed changes dissipated quickly (< 30 s). Mean arterial pressure (MAP; + 4 – 13 mmHg) and heart rate (+ 16 – 20 beats min− 1) increased during fatiguing diaphragm contractions. When central inspiratory motor output was increased for 2 min without diaphragm fatigue by increasing either inspiratory force output (95 % of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP)) or inspiratory flow rate (5 × <b>eupnoea),,</b> MAP and LVR were unchanged; although continuing the high force output trials for 3 min did cause a relatively small but significant increase in LVR and a reduction in. When the breathing pattern of the fatiguing trials was mimicked with no added resistance, LVR was reduced and increased significantly; these changes were attributed to the negative feedback effects on MSNA from augmented tidal volume. Voluntary increases in inspiratory effort, in the absence of diaphragm fatigue, had no effect on and LVR, whereas the two types of diaphragm-fatiguing trials elicited decreases in and increases in LVR. We attribute these changes to a metaboreflex originating in the diaphragm. Diaphragm and forearm muscle fatigue showed very similar time-dependent effects on LVR and...|$|E
