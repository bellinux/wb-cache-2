500|$|The {{shooting}} script features {{a scene in}} Angela's car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty; the scene differed from earlier versions, which set it as a [...] "big scene on a freeway" [...] in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body. The change was a practical decision, as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs. The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash, but only half a day was available. Ball agreed, {{but only if the}} scene could retain a line of Ricky's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman: [...] "When you see something like that, it's like God is looking right at you, <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> And if you're careful, you can look right back." [...] Jane asks: [...] "And what do you see?" [...] Ricky: [...] "Beauty." [...] Ball said, [...] "They wanted to cut that scene. They said it's not important. I said, 'You're out of your fucking mind. It's {{one of the most important}} scenes in the movie!' If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie, that is the line." [...] Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence; set in a schoolyard, it presents a [...] "turning point" [...] for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela. By the end of filming, the script had been through 10 drafts.|$|E

Švyturys Arena had the most spectators in the LKL for a second straight season, this time with 3,474 per game. [...] In the quarter-final, Neptūnas eliminated BC Šiauliai 3–1. The semi-final series versus Lietuvos rytas Vilnius {{was one of the}} most dramatic in the league's history. Neptūnas began it by shocking Rytas in their home arena with an 83–71 victory. Afterwards, the team also secured their home court in Game 2, winning 70–68. The fate of the historic series was to be determined in Game 5, following two dramatic Rytas victories: 66–64 and 74–73. During Game 5, Daniel Ewing led Neptūnas to another stunning upset of the Lithuanian powerhouse 73–72, surprisingly won the intense series 3–2, and advanced into the LKL final <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time in club history. The final series was begun with an 83–72 loss to Žalgiris Kaunas. Just three days later, Neptūnas by surprise swept Žalgiris 76–54 to tie the series 1–1. In spite of that, later Neptūnas failed to compete in the series, losing the next three games by an average of 25 points and the series 1–4.|$|E

If the lion charged it would be too late--the lad must charge first, and to the astonishment of Akut and none the less of Numa, the boy leaped swiftly toward the beast. <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> was the lion {{motionless}} with surprise and in that second Jack Clayton put to the crucial test an accomplishment which he had practiced at school.|$|E

Had he plunged or reared, Derriman's fears might have been verified, and Anne have come with deadly force to the ground. But the course was good, and in the horse's speed lay a comparative security. She was scarcely shaken in her precarious half-horizontal position, though she was awed to see the grass, loose stones, and other objects pass her eyes like strokes whenever she opened them, which was only <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> at intervals of half a minute; and to feel how wildly the stirrups swung, and that what struck her knee was the bucket of the carbine, {{and that it was}} a pistol-holster which hurt her arm.|$|E

As long as It did not come out I felt safe, for It could not see me. Something funny seemed to strike It, and It laughed heartily. After a time It tried to sit up. Fortunately Its head was so heavy that It always lost its balance just as It seemed on the point of succeeding. When It saw that It could not rise, It reflected again, {{and then all of a}} sudden It put Its fist into Its mouth. I gazed in horror; soon only the wrist was to be seen, and I saw that It would choke in another minute. <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> I thought that I would let It do as It liked. Then I cried out, [...] "Don't do that!" [...] and came out from behind the curtain. Slowly It moved Its fist and there we were, looking at each other.|$|E
60|$|I {{have tried}} since {{to imagine how}} the thing must have looked to her. So far as her {{particular}} universe went I had not existed at all, or I had existed only as a dim black thing, an insignificant speck, far away across her park in irrelevant, unimportant transit, until this moment when she came, sedately troubled, into her own secure gardens and sought for Stuart among the greenhouses. Then abruptly I flashed into being down that green-walled, brick-floored vista as a black-avised, ill-clad young man, who first stared and then advanced scowling toward her. Once in existence I developed rapidly. I grew larger in perspective and {{became more and more}} important and sinister every moment. I came up the steps with inconceivable hostility and disrespect in my bearing, towered over her, becoming for an instant at least a sort of second French Revolution, and delivered myself with the intensest concentration of those wicked and incomprehensible words. <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> I threatened annihilation.

I hope it won't leave her skin all scarred. But just afterward, when I was hunting through the bathroom for some cotton to stop the blood, I ran onto a little fuzzy yellow duck we hung on the tree one Christmas, and I remembered she and I'd been awfully happy then--Hell. I can't hardly believe it's me here." [...] As Babbitt's arm tightened about his shoulder, Paul sighed, [...] "I'm glad you came.

The record was finished at Audio Vision {{recording studio}}s in Miami, Florida in March 2000. “Frustration” was released to radio in June 2000 and was the 8th most added song across the country for its first week out. [...] "Frustration" [...] was featured in the film, [...] "Thank You, Good Night". Jenny 867-5309 was featured in an episode of TV's [...] "Roswell" [...] and the video game [...] "ESPN X-Games Skateboarding". [...] "Building Up" [...] was used by HBO in their documentary, [...] "Middle School Confessions". By October 2000, the President and their A&R person were gone from the label. All of the bands these two signed were dropped the same day. Crease {{was one of those}} bands. The group was now without a label and didn’t own the rights to Vindication. Without losing any momentum, the band headed back to the studio to record 5 new songs. After a few showcases, any label interest was waned after the September 11 attacks.|$|E

5000|$|Thus by {{the middle}} of 1997 it was left to Orlando and Minty to be the most {{prolific}} - and in that sense the most successful - Romo bands as they were the only two of the seven core acts to reach the stage of releasing their respective albums. Orlando, having already released two singles <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Second</b> and The Magic EP in late 1996 (the latter of which achieved #96 on the UK Singles Chart [...] ) and a third, Nature's Hated in spring 1997, having toured extensively with Kenickie and having scored the only UK Top 75 chart hit of any core Romo act with their contribution to the Fever Pitch soundtrack EP, a cover of Tim Hardin's How Can We Hang On to a Dream, released their album Passive Soul in October that year before Dickon Edwards departed to found Fosca. Tim Chipping would continue to use the Orlando band name for a planned folk-orientated second album under the working title Sick Folk (to have included a collaboration with Kenickie/Rosita members Marie Du Santiago and Emmy-Kate Montrose), before finally dissolving Orlando in Spring 2000. [...] Minty, likewise, having released singles Useless Man, Plastic Bag (a No. 2 hit in the Netherlands) That's Nice and Nothing, released their parent album Open Wide in late 1997 before also disbanding, with some members later forming rock band The Servant. With all the core bands and major London clubnights now defunct (or at least no longer in their Romo incarnations), the Romo scene effectively came to an end.|$|E
