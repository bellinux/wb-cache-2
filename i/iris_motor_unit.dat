40|$|One {{physiological}} {{method for}} estimating the <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> number in a muscle depends on dividing into the maximum compound muscle action potential, the potential {{average of the}} first few <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> potentials excited by a motor nerve stimulus above motor threshold. To be valid, such an average unit potential size must {{be representative of the}} whole <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> population. This assumption may not be justified. The present study has shown that there are single <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> in healthy and abnormal, thenar, and EDB <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> populations, many times larger than any <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> excited close to the motor threshold. This finding suggests that previously reported <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> estimates may not only be an overestimate of the true <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> population number, but have excluded much larger <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> with higher thresholds. Low <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> estimates in neuropathies may result from a change in the order of activation of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> with the appearance of larger <b>motor</b> <b>units,</b> normally of higher threshold among the first few just above the motor threshold...|$|R
50|$|Neural changes like reduced <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> {{discharge}} rates, increased {{variability of}} <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> discharge activity, altered recruitment and derecruitment behavior mediate modifications in muscle control. On the other hand, physiological deleterious factors including <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> loss, increased <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> innervation ratios also affect muscle force. Through strength training, old adults can significantly improve their force control. The rapid adaptation suggests modifications in <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> activation, increased excitability of motoneuron pool, and decreased antagonist cocontraction.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relative proportion of motor-unit action potentials that are uniquely represented in the simulated and experimental surface electromyogram (EMG). Two hundred <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> were simulated in a cylindrical anatomical system. Action potentials for each <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> were generated with a model and then {{compared with those of}} other <b>motor</b> <b>units.</b> Pairs of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> were considered indistinguishable and the <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> not uniquely represented in the surface EMG, when the difference in the mean energy for the pair of potentials was < 5 %. The anatomical conditions and recording configurations had a substantial influence on the percentage of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> that could be uniquely identified in the simulated EMG. For example, a single monopolar channel could discriminate only 3. 4 % of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> in the simulated population, whereas a system with 81 Laplacian channels arranged in a grid could discriminate 83. 8 % of the <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> under the same conditions. The simulation results were confirmed with populations of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> recorded experimentally from the abductor digiti minimi muscle of eight healthy men. Furthermore, the relative proportion of uniquely identified <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> in the simulated signal was only moderately related to motor-unit size and distance from the electrodes. These results indicate the upper limit for detection of individual <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> from the surface EMG and show that a few channels of surface EMG recordings are not sufficient to study single <b>motor</b> <b>units.</b> The noninvasive identification of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> from the surface EMG requires the use of multiple channels of information...|$|R
50|$|A <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> {{is defined}} as one motor neuron {{and all of the}} muscle fibers it innervates. When a <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> fires, the impulse (called an action potential) is carried down the motor neuron to the muscle. The area where the nerve {{contacts}} the muscle is called the neuromuscular junction, or the motor end plate. After the action potential is transmitted across the neuromuscular junction, an action potential is elicited in all of the innervated muscle fibers of that particular <b>motor</b> <b>unit.</b> The sum of all this electrical activity is known as a <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> action potential (MUAP). This electrophysiologic activity from multiple <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> is the signal typically evaluated during an EMG. The composition of the <b>motor</b> <b>unit,</b> the number of muscle fibres per <b>motor</b> <b>unit,</b> the metabolic type of muscle fibres and many other factors affect the shape of the <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> potentials in the myogram.|$|R
40|$|Virtually all {{movements}} {{involve the}} recruitment of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> from multiple muscles. Given the functional diversity of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> (motoneurons and the muscle fibers they supply), the effective production of specific movements undoubtedly depends upon some principle(s) to organize the ensemble of active <b>motor</b> <b>units.</b> The principle acting to organize {{the recruitment of}} <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> within muscles is the size principle, whereby the first <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> to be recruited have the smallest values for axonal conduction velocity and contractile force, and are the slowest to contract and fatigue. Here we {{consider the possibility that}} the size principle applies in the recruitment of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> across muscles, i. e., that regardless of their muscles of origin, active <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> are recruited in rank order, for example, from low to high conduction velocity. The benefits of orderly recruitment across muscles could be similar to the acknowledged advantages of orderly recruitment within muscles. One benefit is that the neural process involved in organizing active <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> would be simplified. In a muscle-based scheme, the size principle would organize only those <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> within individual muscles, leaving the nervous system with the additional task of coordinating the relative activities of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> from different muscles. By contrast, in an ensemble-based scheme, orderly recruitment of all <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> according to the size principle would automatically coordinate <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> both within and across motor nuclei. Another potential benefit is the provision for movements with smooth trajectory, the result of interleaving the divergent torque contributions made by <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> from muscles that differ in their orientations about joints. Otherwise, if order were restricted within muscles, the torque trajectory of a joint would change unevenly as participating muscles begin contracting at different times and grade activity at different rates. These considerations support speculation that <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> recruited from co-contracting muscles are collectively recruited according to the size principle...|$|R
50|$|<b>Motor</b> <b>units</b> are {{multiple}} muscle fibers bundled together. When a person {{wants to move}} their body to achieve a certain task, the brain sends an impulse signal that reaches the specific <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> through the spinal cord. After receiving the signal from the brain, the <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> contracts muscle fibers within the group to create movement. There is no partial firing in the <b>motor</b> <b>unit,</b> meaning, once the signal is detected, all the muscles fibers within the unit contract. However, there are different intensities. Since each <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> contracts 100% of its fiber once stimulated, types of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> that generate different force or speed are significant.|$|R
5000|$|The {{central nervous}} system has two {{distinct}} ways of controlling the force produced by a muscle through <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> recruitment: spatial recruitment and temporal recruitment. Spatial recruitment is the activation of more <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> to produce a greater force. Larger <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> contract along with small <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> until all muscle fibers in a single muscle are activated, thus producing the maximum muscle force. Temporal <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> recruitment, or rate coding, deals with the frequency of activation of muscle fiber contractions. Consecutive stimulation on the <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> fibres from the alpha motor neuron causes the muscle to twitch more frequently until the twitches [...] "fuse" [...] temporally. This produces a greater force than singular contractions by decreasing the interval between stimulations to produce a larger force with {{the same number of}} <b>motor</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
40|$|D ow nloaded from 2 ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this brief review {{is to examine the}} neural adaptations {{associated}} with training, by focusing on the behavior of single <b>motor</b> <b>units.</b> The review synthesizes current understanding on <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> recruitment and rate coding during voluntary contractions, briefly describes the techniques used to record <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> activity, and then evaluates the adaptations that have been observed in <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> activity during maximal and submaximal contractions. Relatively few studies have directly compared <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> behavior before and after training. Although some studies suggest that the voluntary activation of muscle can increase slightly with strength training, it is not known how the discharge of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> changes to produce this increase in activation. The evidence indicates that the increase is not attributable to changes in <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchronization.

Because of technical limitations, these relations have been previously tested either indirectly or in small <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> samples that revealed weak associations between <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> recruitment threshold (RT) and MUCV.

40|$|<b>Motor</b> <b>unit</b> {{synchronization}} is {{a measure}} of the near simultaneous discharge in pairs of <b>motor</b> <b>units,</b> and provides information on the shared synaptic input to motor neurons.

The purpose of the study was to compare the strength of <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchronization (CIS index) during isometric, position-holding, and slow (1. 7 degrees/s) shortening and lengthening (anisometric) contractions of the first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI). <b>Motor</b> <b>unit</b> activity was recorded from the same <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> during these tasks with two fine-wire intramuscular electrodes in FDI. For comparison between the isometric and the position-holding task, 9 <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> pairs were sampled from 6 subjects. The strength of <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchronization (CIS ± SD imp/s) was greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) during position holding (0. 86 ± 0. 31 imp/s) than isometric contractions (0. 69 ± 0. 40 imp/s). For all task conditions, 5 <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> pairs were sampled from 4 subjects. <b>Motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchronization was greatest for the anisometric contractions (1. 24 ± 0. 66 imp/s), intermediate for the position holding (0. 81 ± 0. 38 imp/s) and least for the isometric contractions (0. 70 ± 0. 48 imp/s). Preliminary data from 3 <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> pairs suggested that <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchronization was consistently greater during lengthening contractions (1. 75 ± 0. 60 imp/s) compared with shortening contractions (1. 41 ± 0. 30 imp/s).

40|$|A {{wide range}} of <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> sizes exists in each frog sartorius, with values of tetanus and twitch {{tensions}} extending over 62 - and 400 -fold ranges, respectively. These differences primarily represent differences in the number, rather than the size, of muscle fibres in each <b>motor</b> <b>unit.</b> Tetanus-to-twitch tension ratios varied markedly between different <b>motor</b> <b>units,</b> ranging from 1. 5 to over 190. Because directly stimulated muscle fibres have tetanus/twitch ratios no larger than 3, it is concluded that high tetanus/twitch ratios arise from recruitment of muscle fibres during the tetanus which respond with only subthreshold depolarization during a twitch. Small <b>motor</b> <b>units,</b> as judged either by their twitch or tetanus tension, were associated with higher tetanus/twitch ratios, suggesting that the average safety margin of a <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> increases with the <b>motor</b> <b>unit's</b> size. Indeed, when the tetanus/twitch ratio of a <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> is {{used to determine the}} fraction of fibres in the unit with subthreshold neuromuscular junctions, it is observed that there is a direct linear relationship between the size of the <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> and its over-all efficacy of synaptic transmission. Measurements of the effects of changes in calcium concentration on <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> twitch tension confirmed the last conclusion. Furthermore, this analysis revealed that large <b>motor</b> <b>units,</b> although having a {{wide range of}} transmission safety margins, are largely comprised of junctions of uniformly high safety margin.

40|$|The spike-triggered {{averaged}} (STA) {{technique was}} used to examine trapezius <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> potentials and their dependence on contraction amplitude and firing history. Individual <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> firings were identified by a fine-wire intramuscular electrode, while STA-derived potentials were extracted from the simultaneously recorded surface electromyographic (SEMG) signal. Amplitude-controlled contractions and contractions with typing tasks and mental stress were carried out. STA potentials were mostly derived from 20 s intervals of firing. <b>Motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchrony was estimated by peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs). An association between SEMG amplitude and STA-derived <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> potentials was found: <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> area showed a four-fold increase when SEMG amplitude increased from 1. 5 to 10. 5 % of the root mean square-detected SEMG signal at maximal voluntary contraction (%EMGmax). Low- and higher threshold <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> potentials, all with recruitment thresholds < 10 % EMGmax, had similar area at the same contraction amplitude. A significant increase in the STA-derived potentials was observed after 3 min of constant-amplitude contractions; however, this difference was reduced after 10 min and no longer present after 30 min of contraction. <b>Motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchrony accounted for, on average, 2. 8 % additional firings within 2 ms of the triggering <b>motor</b> <b>unit.</b> We conclude that the increase in STA-derived potentials with contraction amplitude is, to a major extent, due to <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchrony, limiting the applicability of this method in postural muscles presenting wide <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> potentials. The similar area of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> at same SEMG amplitude may indicate that trapezius <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> recruited below 10 % EMGmax are of similar size and thus not organized according to the Henneman size principle...|$|R
50|$|According to Henneman's size principle, <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> {{recruitment}} {{is always}} {{in the same order}} from smallest to largest <b>motor</b> <b>unit.</b> Additionally, the <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> action potential is an all-or-none phenomenon - once the recruitment threshold (the stimulus intensity at which a <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> begins to fire) is reached, it fires fully. Incremental stimulation starts giving electrical stimulation at a very low stimulus intensity and increases gradually to reach the recruitment threshold of successively larger <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> until the intensity of the CMAP is reached. A 'step' is noted when an increase in stimulus leads to an increase in recorded EMG (i.e. another <b>motor</b> <b>unit's</b> threshold is reached and it is recruited). The CMAP is then divided by the number of steps required to reach the intensity of the CMAP to get a mean SMUAP size.

The discharge characteristics of 53 <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> in biceps brachii were recorded after being recruited during a sustained contraction. Some <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> (n = 22) discharged action potentials tonically after being recruited, whereas others (n = 31) discharged intermittent trains of action potentials. The two groups of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> were distinguished by the difference between the recruitment threshold of the <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> and the target force for the sustained contraction: tonic, 5. 9 ± 2. 5 %; intermittent, 10. 7 ± 2. 9 %. Discharge rate for the tonic units decreased progressively (13. 9 ± 2. 7 to 11. 7 ± 2. 6 pulses s− 1; P = 0. 04) during the 99 ± 111 s contraction. Train rate, train duration and average discharge rate for the intermittent <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> did not change across 211 ± 153 s of intermittent discharge. The initial discharge rate at recruitment during the sustained contraction was lower for the intermittent <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> (11. 0 ± 3. 3 pulses s− 1) than the tonic <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> (13. 7 ± 3. 3 pulses s− 1; P = 0. 005), and the coefficient of variation for interspike interval was higher for the intermittent <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> (34. 6 ± 12. 3 %) than the tonic <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> (21. 2 ± 9. 4 %) at recruitment (P = 0. 001) and remained elevated for discharge duration (34. 6 ± 9. 2 %versus 19. 1 ± 11. 7 %, P < 0. 001). In an additional experiment, 12 <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> were recorded at two different target forces below recruitment threshold (5. 7 ± 1. 9 % and 10. 5 ± 2. 4 %).

40|$|Background The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to establish new insight into the motor control of low-threshold <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> in the trapezius muscle. Special attention was given to <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> recruitment threshold related to firing behavior. The extensive literature on motor control mainly concerns firing behavior of extremity muscles. Motor control of the upper trapezius shows features that indicate deviations from the control scheme generally assumed to apply to muscles of the extremities. Knowledge of motor control of the trapezius is important in a pain development perspective, since shoulder/neck complaints are frequently localized to this muscle. Methods Constant amplitude contractions of 2 to 30 min duration, with amplitudes between ~ 2 – 7 % of maximal voluntary contraction (2 - 7 % EMGmax), were used to study time-dependent changes in <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> firing. Transient force increases reaching 15 - 20 % EMGmax were superimposed {{on some of these}} contractions in an attempt to induce <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> substitution. Sinusoidal contraction profiles were used to study firings in response to dynamic contractions. <b>Motor</b> <b>unit</b> firing was studied in 10 min contractions with vocational (typing) tasks and mental stress. The spike-triggered averaged (STA) technique was used to examine <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> potentials and their dependence on contraction amplitude and firing history. The individual <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> firings were recorded by intramuscular fine wire electrodes, while simultaneously recording the surface electromyographic (SEMG) signal. The Precision Decomposition technique was used to identify individual <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> with near 100 % accuracy. Results The results show that some low-threshold <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> stopped firing {{at the end of the}} EMG-pulses while <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> with initially higher threshold were recruited or stayed active. The lowest threshold <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> showed only brief silent periods. The mean firing rate increased from 10. 5 to 12. 5 pulses per second (pps) in response to contraction amplitudes of 4 % EMGmax, but the mean firing rate the same for all <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> regardless of task and recruitment threshold given the SEMG amplitude. There was a strong rate modulation in dynamic contractions. STA-derived <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> potentials indicated that <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> recruited below EMGmax had similar area at the same contraction amplitude. However, the area increased four-fold when SEMG amplitude increased from 1. 5 to 10 % EMGmax. <b>Motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchronization showed an average of 2. 8 % additional firings within of the triggering <b>motor</b> <b>unit,</b> estimated by peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs). A surprising finding was respiratory modulation of the firing rate at low contraction amplitudes. This modulation was attenuated by induced mental stress. Conclusions Transient force increases promote derecruitment of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> and may be attributed to inactivation of non-inactivating inward currents (plateau potentials). Silencing of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> can be considered a protective mechanism to reduce the metabolic load on low-threshold <b>motor</b> <b>units.</b> The similar firing rates in sustained contractions independent of task and recruitment threshold suggest that the duration and pattern of silent periods are the most important variables to investigate in relation to <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> over-exertion and subsequent pain development. The strong rate modulation in response to dynamic contractions indicates a control strategy resembling that of extremity muscles. STA-derived <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> potentials indicate that units recruited below 10 % EMGmax are of similar size, thus suggesting a deviation from the Henneman size principle. This may be an adaptation to postural functionality. The increase in STAderived potentials is largely due to <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchronization. This points out limitations for this method when quantifying <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> size, numbers and conduction velocity. Finally, respiratory modulation of firing rate and the attenuation by mental stress suggest at least two different sources of autonomic input that may facilitate <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> activity. dr. scient. dr. scient...|$|R

Relatively few studies have directly compared <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> behavior before and after training. Although some studies suggest that the voluntary activation of muscle can increase slightly with strength training, it is not known how the discharge of <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> changes to produce this increase in activation.

It has been demonstrated, however, that training can increase both the rate of torque development and the discharge rate of <b>motor</b> <b>units.</b> Furthermore, both strength training and practice of a force-matching task can evoke adaptations in the discharge characteristics of <b>motor</b> <b>units.</b> Because the variability in discharge rate has a significant influence on the fluctuations in force during submaximal contractions, the changes produced with training can influence motor performance during activities of daily living.

40|$|The {{electrical}} activity of single <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> was recorded {{from the first}} dorsal interosseous muscles of nine patients with Parkinson's disease. Six of these patients had {{a combination of the}} following abnormal <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> properies: (1) a variable delay period of 20 seconds to 3 minutes between the initiation of voluntary effort and the recruitment of the first group of motor units; (2) after recruitment, some of the <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> stopped firing for durations of 10 s, 40 s, 75 s [...] . 3 min.; (3) some of the <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> fired at abnormally low frequencies of 2 - 3 per second. All these six patients had slowed finger movement, and five of the six were studied while off levodopa for two to seven days. One of these patients, reinvestigated after levodopa therapy had been restarted, demonstrated improvement in <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> control. The three remaining patients who were studied while on uninterrupted levodopa therapy could make rapid finger movements, could recruit <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> without delay, and could fire recruited <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> continuously at normal frequencies of 6 - 14 per second. These results suggest that levodopa therapy is effective in Parkinson's disease at least partly because of its ability to correct abnormalities in the recruitment of <b>motor</b> <b>units.</b> Levodopa also corrects the abnormal <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> firing pattern. The abnormal <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> properties found in these patients could account for some aspects of bradykinesia...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{quantify}} the strength of <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchronization and coherence from pairs of concurrently active <b>motor</b> <b>units</b> before and after short-term (4 – 8 weeks) strength training of the left first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. Five subjects (age 24. 8 ± 4. 3 years) performed a training protocol three times/week that consisted of six sets of ten maximal isometric index finger abductions, whereas three subjects (age 27. 3 ± 6. 7 years) acted as controls. <b>Motor</b> <b>unit</b> activity was recorded from pairs of intramuscular electrodes in the FDI muscle with two separate <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> recording sessions obtained before and after strength training (trained group) or after 4 weeks of normal daily activities that did not involve training (control group). The training intervention resulted in a 54 % (45. 2 ± 8. 3 to 69. 5 ± 13. 8 N, P = 0. 001) increase in maximal index finger abduction force, whereas there was no change in strength in the control group. A total of 163 <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> pairs (198 single <b>motor</b> <b>units)</b> were examined in both subject groups, with 52 <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> pairs obtained from 10 recording sessions before training and 51 <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> pairs from 10 recording sessions after training. Using the cross-correlation procedure, there was no change in the strength of <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchronization following strength training (common input strength index; 0. 71 ± 0. 41 to 0. 67 ± 0. 43 pulses/s). Furthermore, <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> coherence z scores at low (0 – 10 Hz; 3. 9 ± 0. 3 before to 4. 4 ± 0. 4 after) or high (10 – 30 Hz; 1. 7 ± 0. 1 before to 1. 9 ± 0. 1 after) frequencies were not influenced by strength training. These <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> data indicate that increases in strength following several weeks of training a hand muscle are not accompanied by changes in <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> synchronization or coherence, suggesting that these features of correlated <b>motor</b> <b>unit</b> activity are not important in the expression of muscle strength...|$|R
