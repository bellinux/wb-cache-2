5|$|Weather {{forecasting}} is {{the application}} {{of science and technology}} to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. <b>Human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>have</b> attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about {{the current state of the}} atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change.|$|E
5|$|<b>Human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>have</b> {{played a}} role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E
5|$|In {{his opinion}} all <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>have</b> the same {{abilities}} {{with regard to}} reason, feelings and imagination, but these basic ingredients are used in different ways and in different environments, which gives rise to different cultures and civilizations. According to him {{it is obvious that}} the culture on Tierra del Fuego is at a lower level of development than European culture, but he also admits that the conditions of life there are much more difficult and this gives people very little chance to develop a higher culture. Based on these opinions he was classified as one of the main examples of 18th-century German cosmopolitanism.|$|E

5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>have</b> the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others when they do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, the needs of others, and the feelings that surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E

25|$|Humanism is a {{democratic}} and ethical life stance, which affirms that <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>have</b> the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives.

It is also considered as causing endogenous glycation processes since it metabolises into glucose and fructose in the body.|$|E

25|$|Humanity's {{ability to}} detect {{intelligent}} extraterrestrial life has existed for only a very brief period—from 1937 onwards, if {{the invention of the}} radio telescope is taken as the dividing line—and Homo sapiens is a geologically recent species. The whole period of modern human existence to date is a very brief period on a cosmological scale, and radio transmissions have only been propagated since 1895. Thus, it remains possible that <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>have</b> neither existed long enough nor made themselves sufficiently detectable to be found by extraterrestrial intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Although, human sacrifices are not {{prevalent}} in India, rare isolated incidents happen occasionally, especially in rural areas. In some cases, <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>have</b> {{been replaced by}} animals and birds. But after backlash from animal rights groups, in some places they {{have been replaced by}} human effigies. The beliefs behind these sacrifices vary from inducing rainfall to helping childless women conceive. It is alleged that some cases often go unreported or are covered up. Between 1999 and 2006, about 200 cases of child sacrifices were reported from Uttar Pradesh.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Slife and Williams {{write that}} one of the hidden {{assumptions}} in CBT is that of determinism, or the absence of free will. They argue that CBT invokes a type of cause-and-effect relationship with cognition. They state that CBT holds that external stimuli from the environment enter the mind, causing different thoughts that cause emotional states. Nowhere in CBT theory is agency, or free will, accounted for. At its most basic foundational assumptions, CBT holds that <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>have</b> no free will and are just determined by the cognitive processes invoked by external stimuli.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of {{extensive}} cultivation of legumes (particularly soy, alfalfa, and clover), growing use of the Haber–Bosch process {{in the creation of}} chemical fertilizers, and pollution emitted by vehicles and industrial plants, <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>have</b> more than doubled the annual transfer of nitrogen into biologically available forms. In addition, humans have significantly contributed to the transfer of nitrogen trace gases from Earth to the atmosphere and from the land to aquatic systems. Human alterations to the global nitrogen cycle are most intense in developed countries and in Asia, where vehicle emissions and industrial agriculture are highest.|$|E
25|$|<b>Human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>have</b> often {{sought to}} give {{concrete}} form to our powerful collective longing for peace.

However, {{the second half of}} the twentieth century has seen most of those taboos broken. Guernica was the point of departure, and Hiroshima is the ultimate symbol. We must find ways to communicate to future generations the history of horror that began with Guernica....|$|E

Books will be harder to get at. Stupidity will gain a little ground.|$|E
