50|$|<b>Discitis</b> or diskitis is an {{infection}} in the intervertebral disc space that affects different age groups. In adults {{it can lead to}} severe consequences such as sepsis or epidural abscess but can also spontaneously resolve, especially in children under 8 years of age. <b>Discitis</b> occurs post surgically in approximately 1-2 percent of patients after spinal surgery.|$|E
50|$|Possible {{complications}} include nerve damage, <b>discitis,</b> {{an infection}} of the disc. Strong antibiotics are usually administered as a precaution.|$|E

50|$|Spondylodiscitis is a {{combination}} of <b>discitis</b> (inflammation of one or more intervertebral disc spaces) and spondylitis (inflammation of one or more vertebrae), the latter generally involving the areas adjacent to the intervertebral disc space.|$|E
50|$|The {{intervertebral}} disc space is typically defined on an X-ray photograph as {{the space between}} adjacent vertebrae. In healthy patients, this corresponds {{to the size of}} the {{intervertebral disc}}. The size of the space can be altered in pathological conditions such as <b>discitis</b> (infection of the intervertebral disc).|$|E
50|$|If {{the patient}} is an adult many {{surgeons}} and doctors now recommend moving little and often and within the pain limits of the medication. Discs respond to osmotic pressure therefore movement is beneficial to increase their blood flow and fluid dynamics. This is why disc patients are no longer told to bed rest. In children whether to bed rest or move a little is decided on an individual basis, depending on the site and severity of the <b>discitis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An abscess in the {{psoas muscle}} of the abdomen {{may be caused}} by lumbar tuberculosis. Owing to the {{proximal}} attachments of the iliopsoas, such an abscess may drain inferiorly into the upper medial thigh and present as a swelling in the region. The sheath of the muscle arises from the lumbar vertebrae and the intervertebral discs between the vertebrae. The disc is more susceptible to infection, from tuberculosis and Salmonella <b>discitis.</b> The infection can spread into the psoas muscle sheath.|$|E
50|$|There is {{debate as}} to the cause, {{although}} hematogenous seeding of the offending organism is favored as well as direct spread. It is important to differentiate between spontaneous <b>discitis</b> which is usually from hematologic spread from a urinary or respiratory infection versus that from a post-operative complication which usually involves skin flora such as staph aureus.It can be caused due to spinal tuberculosis and spread along spinal ligament to involve the adjacent anterior vertebral bodies, causing angulation of the vertebrae with subsequent kyphosis.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis of {{vertebral}} osteomyelitis {{is often}} complicated {{due to the}} delay between {{the onset of the}} disease and the initial display of symptoms. Before pursuing radiological methods of testing, physicians often order a full blood test to see how the patient's levels compare to normal blood levels in a healthy body. In a complete blood test, the C-reactive protein (CRP) is an indicator of infection levels, the complete blood count (CBC) evaluates the presence of white and red blood cells, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) tests for inflammation in the body. Anomalous values that lie outside the acceptable ranges in any of these subcategories confirm the presence of infection in the body and indicate that further diagnostic measures are necessary. Blood tests may prove inconclusive and may not serve as enough evidence to confirm the presence of vertebral osteomyelitis. Diagnosis can also be complicated due to the disease's similarity to <b>discitis,</b> commonly known as an infection of the disc space. Both diseases are characterized by a patient's inability to walk and concentrated back pain; however, patients with vertebral osteomyelitis often appear more ill than those with <b>discitis.</b> Additional measures may be called upon to rule out the possibility of discitis; such approaches include diagnosing the disease through various medical imaging techniques.|$|E

50|$|Symptoms include severe back pain, {{leading to}} lack of mobility. Some very young {{children}} may refuse to walk and arching of the back is possible. In post-operative situations, the symptoms occur within a week and result in severe low back pain or neck pain (depending on the surgical location). If untreated, the <b>discitis</b> may resolve on its own, causing spontaneous fusion of the intervertebral disc space, cause a chronic low grade infection, or progress to osteomyelitis and possibly even an epidural abscess.

40|$|<b>Discitis</b> is a {{potential}} complication of any open or percutaneous spinal procedure which involves entry into the intervertebral disc. The infection initiates an inflammatory response which leads to endplate rupture. Although there are variations in the severity of symptoms, the main feature of <b>discitis</b> is severe back pain which is not relieved by rest. The infection may spontaneously resolve over time although incapacitating back pain may persist for many months. In some cases serious complications result from the spread of infection to the adjacent vertebral bodies and over time osteomyelitis will develop with resultant bone destruction and collapse. The prognosis for many patients with <b>discitis</b> is poor with continual disabling back pain, prolonged absence from gainful employment and inability to return to daily living activities. Clinical and experimental evidence now supports the prophylactic use of a suitable antibiotic to prevent <b>discitis.</b> In South Australia cephazolin is the antibiotic of choice to prevent or treat <b>discitis</b> due to Staphylococcus spp. While cephazolin {{has been shown to}} prevent <b>discitis</b> after inoculation with Staphylococcus spp. it is not universally accepted. Uncertainty exists regarding the ability of the antibiotic to enter the disc, and if it is effective in preventing and treating <b>discitis.</b> This is further complicated by the lack of suitable methods for detecting and measuring the concentration of cephazolin in the disc. An experimental ovine model was used to investigate (a) the natural progression of <b>discitis</b> in the growing lumbar spine; (b) a technique to detect and measure the concentration of cephazolin in the disc; (c) the effect of prophylaxis when dose and time of administration of cephazolin was varied; (d) the effect of parenteral cephazolin after <b>discitis</b> was established and (e) the influence of health and age of the disc on prophylactic and parenteral treatment with cephazolin. In a clinical study the concentration of cephazolin was measured in degenerate human disc tissue to determine if therapeutic concentrations were achieved. The ovine studies showed that <b>discitis</b> had no significant effect {{on the development of the}} growing lumbar spine after one year although infection was associated with reduced disc area and height. Preventing <b>discitis</b> with cephazolin was reasonably successful, regardless of age and health of the disc. Timing of cephazolin administration was crucial to prevent <b>discitis</b> in immature animals. A high - performance liquid chromatography technique was used to measure the concentration of cephazolin in the disc. The greatest concentration of cephazolin in ovine discs was achieved 15 minutes after a bolus dose of intravenous antibiotic was administered, although detectable levels were measured for a further 2 hours. The concentration of cephazolin was not uniform across the disc with greater concentrations in the outer disc compared to the inner disc. Although there were measurable levels of cephazolin in these discs, it was ineffective at treating <b>discitis</b> once established. In the clinical study detectable levels of cephazolin were recovered in human discs for more than 2 hours after administering a 1 - g bolus dose. The concentration of cephazolin peaked in the human discs between 37 and 53 minutes, but in only half of the discs was the concentration of cephazolin considered therapeutic against Staphylococcus aureus. While <b>discitis</b> may spontaneously resolve over time, the infected disc does not recover to its original form. Furthermore, parenteral cephazolin was ineffective at preventing endplate destruction once an intradiscal inoculum was established. While this study proved cephazolin is able to enter the disc and provide reasonable protection against infection, it appears that <b>discitis</b> cannot be completely abolished. The timing of prophylaxis remains a critical factor to achieve therapeutic concentrations of cephazolin in the disc. Due to the serious complications that result from <b>discitis</b> this study supports the use of prophylactic antibiotic administered at an optimal time before the disc is violated during any spinal procedure.

40|$|International audienceCase report. To {{illustrate}} {{the usefulness of}} broad-range bacterial polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing in osteoarticular infections by Capnocytophaga canimorsus. C. canimorsus is a gram-negative bacillus that was first identified in 1976. It is a normal inhabitant of the oral mucosa of dogs (26 %) and cats (15 %). The main clinical patterns are septicemia, which may cause fatal septic shock (in 30 % of cases) but arthritis and <b>discitis</b> are possible. C. canimorsus is susceptible to many antimicrobials including β-lactam antibiotics. About a case report of 54 -year-old man transferred to our institution for <b>discitis,</b> we discuss about PCR for C. canimorsus <b>discitis</b> diagnosis. At admission, the only abnormal physical finding was global pain and stiffness of the lumbar spine.

40|$|Abstract Twelve {{cases of}} {{intervertebral}} <b>discitis</b> following lumbar discectomy were evaluated and ESR was assessed in 70 patients operated on and without evidence of postoperative infection. Six of the intervertebral <b>discitis</b> patients were studied retrospectively and 6 prospectively. In the retrospective group, patients reported that symptoms appeared on average 15 {{days after the}} operation. Antibiotic treatment generally began 31 days after the operation and lasted 62 days; symptoms regressed after 3. 9 months. All patients showed long-term radiographic vertebral changes and osteolysis in the cases treated later. In the prospective group, the first symptoms appeared on average 5 days after the operation, treatment started after 8 days and lasted 41 days. Symptoms regressed after 1. 8 months. There were only 3 cases of vertebral radiographic changes. In both groups, ESR was always more than 70. The most useful diagnostic imaging tests were conventional tomography and MRI.

40|$|Background: The {{established}} protocols {{of treatment}} of postoperative lumbar <b>discitis</b> {{have not been}} validated till date. We report a retrospective analysis {{of a series of}} patients with <b>discitis</b> following single level lumbar discectomy. We analyzed the outcome of conservative treatment of postoperative <b>discitis</b> with the objective to define when and what surgery was required when the conservative treatment failed. Materials and Methods: A total of 17 cases of postoperative <b>discitis</b> treated from 2002 to 2009 were followed up and evaluated clinically, radiologically and by laboratory investigations. All the patients were treated initially conservatively with rest and antibiotic therapy after diagnosis {{and those who did not}} respond to conservative treatment of at least 4 weeks were treated surgically. The cases were followed up with serial C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for at least 1 year. Results: The mean followup was 40. 38 months (range 12 - 86 months). Four cases failed to respond to conservative therapy and were treated surgically. In three of these four cases, open debridement, transpedicular fixation and posterolateral fusion was performed, and in the fourth case percutaneous transpedicular fixation was done. In the former group, one case was diagnosed to be tubercular, in another case Staphylococcus aureus was cultured where as the third case culture was sterile. All operated patients showed evidence of interbody fusion at 1 year followup. Conclusions: Early detection and aggressive treatment are paramount in managing postoperative <b>discitis</b> and the majority do well with conservative treatment.

40|$|An unusual {{cause of}} non-weight bearing A 13 -month-old girl {{presented}} with refusal to weight bear and walk for 2 weeks. She was refusing to sit or lie on her back.

Two weeks before admission, she had upper respiratory tract infection treated with antibiotics. Her birth and neonatal period were uneventful. Developmental milestones were normal.

Blood investigations revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 75, normal C reactive protein, normal creatine kinase and a white cells count of 14 × 109. She had a MRI spine (figure 1) which showed increased T 2 signal of L 3 /L 4 vertebral bodies with near total obliteration of disc space. <b>Discitis</b> was diagnosed.

40|$|THE POST-OPERATIVE LUMBAR SPINE A {{radiological}} {{investigation of}} the lumbar spine after discectomy using MR imagingand CT by Per Grane From the Departments of Neuroradiology, Diagnostic Radiology, Neurosurgeryand Orthopaedic surgery, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. Problems and aims: The clinical outcome of repeat lumbar discectomy isnot as satisfactory {{as that of the}} primary surgical procedure. One reason is thedifficulty of assessing post operative radiological investigations and particularlythe significance of the various radiological changes. A second problem is differentiatingbetween the two forms of post-operative <b>discitis.</b> a rare but important complicationafter lumbar discectomy. The aims of this study were: to improve understanding ofthe significance of certain post-operative radiological changes; and to evaluatedifferences in the MR features of septic and aseptic post-operative <b>discitis.</b> Material and Methods: A total of 192 patients (209 disc levels) took partin this study; all had had prior lumbar discectomy. Nineteen of these patients wereregarded as asymptomatic and they served as a control group in the evaluation ofcertain post-operative changes in the symptomatic patients. Twelve patients withpost-operative <b>discitis</b> were examined in order to compare the MR features of septicand aseptic <b>discitis.</b> MR imaging was performed first without and then with contrastenhancement in all patients. Contrast-enhanced MR imaging was also compared withcontrast-enhanced CT. Results: Owing to its superiority in distinguishing the nerve roots atthe surgical site, MR imaging was found to be a more valuable diagnostic method thanCT. Disc herniations were found in 16 % of the disc levels in asymptomatic patients andin 38 % of disc levels in the symptomatic patients. Significantly more disc herniationswere found in patients who had only a short duration of recurrent symptoms (maximum 3 months) before MR investigation than in the asymptomatic patients. Nerve-root displacementdue to disc herniation was also significantly more frequent in patients with theshort symptom duration than in the patients with a longer symptom duration. Trueintradural nerve-root enhancement was found in 7 % of symptomatic patients, and focalenhancement in the root sleeve was found in 26 % of them; there was good correlationto clinical symptoms and other pathological findings. Thickened nerve roots werefound with equal frequency in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Epidural scartissue diminished with time, showing no significant difference between asymptomaticand symptomatic patients. Out of 6 patients with septic post-operative <b>discitis,</b> 3 showed extensive MR changes, the remaining 3 showed moderate changes which weresimilar to those in another 6 patients who had aseptic <b>discitis.</b> Discussion and Conclusion: MR is the imaging method of choice in the evaluationof patients with recurrent clinical symptoms after disc surgery. Disc herniationsmay be found in asymptomatic patients; it is therefore important to assess the plausibilityof the assumption that the finding of a hemiated disc correlates well with the actualclinical symptoms. Nerve-root displacement and nerve-root enhancement caused by recurrentdisc herniation may strengthen the indication for repeat discectomy. On the otherhand, the finding of a thickened nerve root seems to be of no diagnostic value. TheMR features in post-operative <b>discitis</b> develop only gradually and the dilferentiationbetween septic and aseptic forms of <b>discitis</b> is thus difficult at the early stage.

40|$|Study Design. An ovine {{model of}} <b>discitis</b> {{was used to}} {{determine}} the efficacy of the antibiotic cephazolin for prophylactic use in spinal surgery. Objectives. To determine in juvenile and adult sheep spines if 2 -g cephazolin given at intervals over a 4 -hour period would prevent iatrogenic <b>discitis,</b> and determine the concentration of cephazolin in nucleus and anulus tissue after administration of a bolus dose. Summary of Background Data. It is standard practice at our institutions to give patients undergoing spinal surgery a single prophylactic (1 – 2 g) dose of cephazolin with a second dose for prolonged (> 4 hours) procedures. Although this regimen provides therapeutic serum levels, the levels of antibiotic in the intervertebral disc are significantly lower. Because cephazolin is a negatively charged molecule, it is thought to diffuse poorly into the disc, raising questions about its efficacy as a prophylactic antibiotic for spinal procedures. Methods. There were 18 animals, including 9 lambs and 9 sheep, that received a single 2 -g dose of cephazolin intravenously at 30 -minute intervals over a 4 -hour period. Two control animals (1 sheep and 1 lamb) did not receive antibiotic. All animals had diskograms at 2 previously incised lumbar levels and 2 nonincised levels using contrast that was deliberately contaminated with bacteria. Lateral spine radiographs were taken at postoperative intervals. After 12 weeks, all animals received another 2 -g dose of cephazolin intravenously at intervals before the spines were removed for pathologic and biochemical analysis. Results. <b>Discitis</b> was detected in all control animals. Of those animals given cephazolin, <b>discitis</b> developed in 1 sheep and 4 lambs. <b>Discitis</b> did not develop in any of the sheep that received cephazolin 30 minutes before inoculation. Cephazolin was detected throughout the disc but was more concentrated in the anulus fibrosus. Disc levels of cephazolin peaked at 15 minutes, at which time serum levels were up to 50 times higher. Cephazolin levels in nonoperated and incised discs were not significantly different. Conclusions. A single prophylactic 2 -g dose of cephazolin administered anytime over a 4 -hour period prevented <b>discitis</b> in almost all animals but was not as effective in lambs. Although lambs have a higher vascular supply to deliver antibiotics to the disc, it is likely that some other physiologic factor may be responsible for the increased infection rate. This study supports that timing of antibiotic prophylaxis is critical to prevent iatrogenic disc infection...|$|E
40|$|Infection {{can occur}} after any spinal {{procedure}} that violates the disc {{and although it}} is not common, the potential consequences are serious. Treatment of <b>discitis</b> is not always successful and the key to management is prevention. Intradiscal prophylaxis with antibiotic is routinely used in spinal surgery, but there is a limited understanding of how well antibiotics can enter the avascular disc after intravenous injection. An in vivo ovine study to optimise prophylactic and parenteral treatment of <b>discitis</b> is described to assess the effectiveness of cephazolin in preventing and treating infection. The concentration of cephazolin was measured in disc tissue from normal and degenerate sheep discs to determine if cephazolin can enter the disc and if disc degeneration affects antibiotic uptake. Fourteen sheep were deliberately inoculated with bacteria to induce <b>discitis.</b> Eight sheep ("prophylaxis" group) were given either a 0, 1, 2 or 3 g dose of prophylactic cephazolin before inoculation while the remaining sheep ("treatment" group) were treated with cephazolin commencing 7 days after inoculation for 21 days at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day. Histopathology and radiography were used to assess the effect of the different treatments. Cephazolin was given 30 min prior to sacrifice and the intradiscal concentration was measured by biochemistry. In the "prophylaxis" group all doses of antibiotic provided some protection against infection, although it was not dose dependent. In the "treatment" group <b>discitis</b> was confirmed radiologically and histologically in all animals from 2 weeks onwards. Biochemical assay confirmed that antibiotic is distributed throughout the disc but was present in higher concentration in the anulus fibrosus than the nucleus pulposus. This study demonstrated that whilst the incidence of iatrogenic <b>discitis</b> can be reduced by antibiotic prophylaxis, it could not be abolished in all incidences with a broad-spectrum antibiotic such as cephazolin. Furthermore, antibiotics were ineffective at preventing endplate destruction once an intradiscal inoculum was established. Walters, Rebecca; Rahmat, Razmi; Fraser, Robert; Moore, Rober...|$|E

After preliminary selection of patients a specific protocol was followed, by taking history, clinical examination, biochemical parameters and neuroimaging. Result of treatment was observed on the basis of symptomatic improvement, with laboratory and imaging findings. Results: The most common etiological agent is staphylococcus aureus. The C-reactive protein is the most sensitive clinical laboratory marker to assess the presence of infection and effectiveness of treatment response. MRI is the imaging modality of choice in the diagnosis o...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of Aspergillus terreus <b>discitis</b> which {{developed}} in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia following induction chemotherapy. A. terreus was isolated from sputum, one month earlier, but the physician did not consider it significant at the time. Magnetic resonance imaging study showed the involvement of L 3 - 4, L 4 - 5 and L 5 -S 1 intervertebral discs. Etiology was established by means of histology and culturing a surgical specimen of disc materials. Our patient survived after a surgical debridement and amphotericin B administration with a total dose of 2. 0 g. <b>Discitis</b> caused by Aspergillus terreus is a very rare event. A. terreus {{is one of the}} invasive Aspergillus species. The pathogenetic mechanism is discussed and the literature is reviewed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Discitis</b> is an {{inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} intervertebral disc or disc space. It is an uncommon condition which occurs mostly in young children or as a post-operative complication, such as following an epidural. It is extremely rare in the elderly as disc size and sponginess decreases with age and consequently the risk of infection decreases. In this case, <b>discitis</b> occurred spontaneously in an elderly patient and was complicated by a psoas abscess. The patient also suffers from acute renal failure, chronic heart failure, left sided pneumonia and shingles (Herpes Zoster) in dermatome S 3. A trapped spinal nerve occurring at the intervertebral foramen is a common complication in fact, the subject did suffer from sciatica for the past 30 years. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Objective : To analyze aspects {{related to}} the {{diagnostic}} difficulty in patients with bacterial spondylodiscitis. Methods : Cross-sectional observational study with retrospective data collected in the period from March 2004 to January 2014. Twenty-one patients diagnosed with bacterial spondylodiscitis were analyzed. Results : Women were the most affected, as well as older individuals. Pain in the affected region was the initial symptom in 52 % of patients, and 45. 5 % of the patients had low back pain, and those with dorsal <b>discitis</b> had back pain as the main complaint; the patients with thoracolumbar <b>discitis</b> had pain in that region, and only one patient had sacroiliac <b>discitis.</b> The average time between onset of symptoms and treatment was five months. The lumbar segment was the most affected with 11 cases (52 %), followed by thoracolumbar in 24 %, dorsal in 19 % of cases and a case in the sacroiliac segment. Only seven patients had fever. Pain in the affected level was coincidentally the most common symptom. Conclusions : Early diagnosis of bacterial spondylodiscitis remains a challenge due to the nonspecific signs and symptoms reported by {{the patient and the}} wide variability of laboratory results and imaging. The basis for early diagnosis remains the clinical suspicion at the time of initial treatment...|$|E
