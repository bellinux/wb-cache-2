40|$|The {{influence}} of cultural conditions upon {{the loss of}} virulence in laboratory cultures of Pas-teurella pestis has been noted in the literature. Devignat and Schoetter (1942) reported that 2 highly virulent strains became avirulent after 30 to 36 days when serially transferred in aerated broth at 37 C. Pollitzer (1954) summarized additional conditions under which loss in viru-lence occurred. These included repeated sub-culture at weekly <b>intervals,</b> action <b>of</b> bacterio-phage, <b>cultivation</b> on bile media, prolonged incubation of the broth cultures at 32 C (Otten's procedure), growth in alcohol-broth at 32 C {{for long periods of}} time, and passage of virulent strains through immune animals. The latter 3 conditions were used by Jawetz and Meyer (1943) in producing avirulent strains for their studies on immunity. Data are presented in this paper which indicate that the virulence of P. pestis strains was main-tained when serially transferred in aerated broth at 26 C, or on agar slants at 26 or 37 C. However, a striking reduction in virulence was observed when P. pestis strains were cultured in aerated broth at 37 C from large inocula and serially transferred, or from small inocula without sub-sequent transfer. This attenuation of plague cultures was due to the selection of avirulent variants present in the inoculum or arising during growth.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to isolate the strains of fungi from Camembert type cheese, {{identify}} them and to test isolated strains of Penicillium camemberti for their ability to produce cyclopiazonic acid. The description of micro- and macromorphological features was used for identification of Penicillium camemberti strains. Strains were subsequently in vitro tested on their potential ability to produce mycotoxin cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). All of the 14 strains of Penicillium camemberti, which were obtained from 20 samples of Camembert type cheese, were cultivated 7, 14, 21, 27 and 30 days on CYA medium at 10 ± 1 °C, 15 ± 1 °C and 25 ± 1 °C in the dark.
