60|$|New and {{interesting}} birds were continually brought in, either {{by my own}} boys or by the natives, {{and at the end}} of a week Ali arrived triumphant one afternoon with a fine specimen of the Great Bird of Paradise. The ornamental plumes had not yet attained their full growth, but the richness of their glossy orange colouring, and the exquisite delicacy of the loosely waving feathers, were unsurpassable. At the same time a great black cockatoo was brought in, as well as a fine fruit-pigeon and several small birds, so that we were all kept hard at work skinning till sunset. Just as we had cleared away and packed up for the night, a strange beast was brought, which had been shot by the natives. It resembled in size, and in its white woolly covering, a small <b>fat</b> <b>lamb,</b> but had short legs, hand-like feet with large claws, and a long prehensile tail. It was a Cuscus (C. maculatus), one of the curious marsupial animals of the Papuan region, and I was very desirous to obtain the skin. The owners, however, said they wanted to eat it; and though I offered them a good price, and promised to give them all the meat, there was grout hesitation. Suspecting the reason, I offered, though it was night, to set to work immediately and get out the body for them, to which they agreed. The creature was much hacked about, and the two hind feet almost cut off; but it was the largest and finest specimen of the kind I had seen; and after an hour's hard work I handed over the body to the owners, who immediately cut it up and roasted it for supper.|$|E

50|$|The town {{exists to}} service the local {{agricultural}} community. Surrounding farms mainly produce wheat, barley, canola and wool, while lesser quantities of lupins, oats, alfalfa and other crops are also grown. Beef cattle, <b>fat</b> <b>lambs,</b> and pigs are sideline industries.|$|R
50|$|The {{district}} is an agricultural {{area with the}} main pursuits being wool, <b>fat</b> <b>lamb</b> and beef cattle production. In the past dairying, tin mining and timber were industries {{that contributed to the}} economy of the district.|$|E
50|$|Rams average 100 kg, ewes are {{approximately}} 75-80 kg (175lb). The rams are typically used as terminal sires for first-cross <b>fat</b> <b>lamb</b> production, but the ewes do produce large lean lambs. The Gromark breed is hardy {{with a low}} incidence of fly strike and dystocia.|$|E
50|$|In 2010 {{the village}} still {{retained}} its general store, The Bland Hotel, the central school, a public {{swimming pool and}} a bowling club.

5000|$|The story {{picks up}} where the {{previous}} fable left off, as the Cock returns safe and happy to his family (it's still unknown what his wives think about it, though it's hinted that they are relieved he survived at all), but the fox, Lawrence, was starving as he waits until nightfall before his next hunt. When it gets dark, Lawrence, though he never been to college, had been gifted with knowledge enough to foresee his own future {{and that of his}} descendants by astrology, and after seeing the bad omens that align the planets with unfitting constellations, Lawrence comes to realize that unless he or one of his descendants could repent and amend himself or wrongdoings, he and his family (as the fate of all foxes, but worse to compare) will be shamed forever with the [...] "cursed life of a thief", which is said to be so horrible that it orphans each new generation as the last one is sentenced to death for a crime he didn't commit. Thinking himself a lost cause, Lawrence the fox, in the light of dawn, sees Friar Wolf Waitskaith and assumes that admitting sin in the presence of this assumingly holy man would help free himself. The friar Wolf is pleased as the fox admits to lying, stealing, adultery, and even exaggerates by mentioning murder (few as his successful hunting-and-killings may be). After that, Lawrence the fox, believing himself cleansed of his wrongs, fears doing so again, as he is from a povertous family, and is too proud to work or beg for his meals, but upon Friar Wolf suggesting he fast and eat nothing with flesh until Easter, Lawrence resorts to begging to be an exception to the custom. The friar granted it, but suggested that it would be only fish from the stream at least once or twice a week. Lawrence takes the advice gracefully, but then finds the new practice difficult as he has no net, pole, or boat to fish with properly, and so has to keep swiping at the water and missing his catch. Upon one of these unsuccessful fishing trips, the fox sees a <b>fat</b> <b>lamb</b> had strayed from the flock, and driven by hunger, he cannot resist pouncing on it. While the lamb survived the incident, the shepherd caught Lawrence the fox in the act of attempting to kill it, and although {{he said that he was}} [...] "only kidding" [...] and pleads he'd never do it again, the fox meets his end by a single, unmerciful blow from the shepherd. (the next story is the official beginning of Reynard's tale, as he faces trial for his father's sins.) ...|$|E
40|$|Foot and Mouth disease (FMD) in the UK in 2001 {{exposed the}} complex nature of the {{structure}} in the domestic <b>fat</b> <b>lamb</b> supply chain. This supply chain comprises {{a large number of}} physical and information transactions between members and the underlying complexity is exacerbated by the limited use of traceability mechanisms. This paper provides a detailed overview of the structure and relationships in the UK <b>fat</b> <b>lamb</b> supply chain pre and post FMD 2001. The <b>fat</b> <b>lamb</b> transportation methods used by supply chain members based in the north-east of England are analysed to determine the members’ opinions about optimum transportation practices in relation to cost efficiency, management of animal welfare and consumer safety. These three variables are also used to determine the supply chain members’ opinions concerning the optimum location of auctions and abattoirs. The findings reveal, inter alia, the supply chain’s changing structure and relationship dynamics during and post FMD 2001 and the need for improved integration between farmers, live auctions and abattoirs...|$|E
40|$|The <b>fat</b> <b>lamb</b> {{industry}} has been gaining increasing importance in Australia during recent years. Expansion of production has been encouraged by favourable prices relative to wool, by the extended application of diversified farming methods and by the preference of our chief customer, the United Kingdom, for lamb rather than mutton.

40|$|The potato {{industry}} in South Australia is characterised by very unstable prices. One hypothesis for this instability is that potato growers' acreage responses follow a cobweb pattern, that is, a one year lag of acreage to price. This hypothesis is tested, {{together with a}} two year lag and a distributed lag. The distributed lag model seems the most satisfactory and gives a short-run elasticity of acreage to price of 0. 36 and a long-run elasticity of 1. 09. An alternative to the lagged price hypothesis is the "constant cash return" hypothesis which postulates that potatoes are grown to provide a certain cash income to permit farm development. This explanation of acreage response only seems relevant in the dairying and <b>fat</b> <b>lamb</b> areas of the State. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|E
40|$|The {{raising of}} fat lambs is not {{restricted}} to any particular system of farming, but limitations are imposed by many physical factors, the major ones being soil, climate, topography, and transport facilities. The aim {{of this investigation was}} directed towards obtaining information on; (a) the cost of producing rape, (b) the productive value or gross returns from rape as a <b>fat</b> <b>lamb</b> producer, and (c) the profit or loss on the rape crop when grazed by fattening lambs. The investigations reviewed the importance of rape as a fattening crop and the circumstances under which it is grown. It appears that rape will continue to be grown in the drier areas of the Dominion. It need not be considered essential in the maintenance of soil fertility, but it fits in well with the organisation of labour on cropping farms. The cost of growing the rape crop and the gross returns are influenced by numerous factors, many of which are outside the farmer’s control. The profit from the crop in those cases where store lambs are bought and fattened is governed mainly by the rape yield and the price of store lambs. Under average conditions for farmers to make a profit by buying store lambs and fattening them on rape, there is a tendency for the prices of store lambs to be too high. Finally, investigation has shown that the field to be covered is very complex, conditions varying with the efficiency of the farmer, with soil, weather, crop yield and breed of lamb {{as well as with the}} margin between store and <b>fat</b> <b>lamb</b> prices. Another factor, more difficult to measure, is the benefit obtained from rape in the general crop rotation and farm management...|$|E

40|$|This article {{represents}} {{the early stages}} of a broad enquiry into the marketing of meat. As such the results are tentative only and often uncompleted. To date the work has been concerned mainly with <b>fat</b> <b>lamb</b> prices and supply although a number of side excursions have been made. It has been calculated that total expenditure on meat at the retail level has kept pace with the growth of money income; in other words, when money income increased by, say, one per cent, consumers spent one per cent more on meat (lamb, mutton, beef and pork). While the total quantity consumed per year per caput has not risen substantially considerable shifts have occurred in the consumption of different types of meat and, in particular, the consumption of lamb has increased at the expense of beef consumption. The changes in consumption of these two commodities are closely associated with changes in the price ratio of these two commodities and income. Marketing,...|$|E
40|$|I {{have been}} asked to {{introduce}} the question of "Canterbury Pastures" or "Seed Mixtures for Canterbury.

Our pasture land generally is not on the upgrade in regard to production. I would have expected that at this juncture everything relative to seed mixtures and types of pasture would have been discussed and be well known and that I shall be merely repeating. Be that as it may, I shall repeat. Canterbury pastures can be divided into three types - a) Temporary, b) Short rotation, c) Permanent, all of which are largely required for sheep carrying and <b>fat</b> <b>lamb</b> production, Except on wheat land where seed production is an important branch of Grass farming, the lands on which they are grown can roughly be divided into - 1) Wheat plains, 2) Plain lands 3) Hill country...|$|E
