5|$|In December 2001, {{a single}} morning rush-hour round trip branded SLExpress was {{extended}} to Stamford, with a stop at Bridgeport plus eastbound-only stops at Stratford and Milford. An evening eastbound trip was also extended to Stamford with only the Bridgeport intermediate stop. This trip was intended to allow commuters to reach employment centers in Bridgeport and Stamford without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a transfer at New Haven. On June 24, 2002, additional Stamford trains were added, {{for a total of}} two westbound and three eastbound trains. When West Haven opened in August 2013, it was added to these trips as well.|$|E

5|$|Several armies in the Second World War in Northern European {{countries}} preferred separate winter uniforms {{rather than}} oversuits. The Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, {{as well as}} white winter oversuits. Other German units fighting in Eastern Europe were at first poorly equipped for winter, <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> do with ordinary summer uniforms, but {{in the winter of}} 1942 to 1942 new white two-piece hooded oversuits with long mitten gauntlets started to arrive. American troops in Europe in the winter of 1944 to 1945 improvised snow capes and helmet covers from white cloth such as bed linen.|$|E

5|$|Stanley Warren {{was born}} in England in 1917. He was talented in art from young and was a {{religious}} man. Stanley was employed as a commercial designer producing poster ads with the Grenada organisation before the war. In January 1940, he enlisted in the army to join the fight against Nazi Germany and was posted to the Royal Regiment of Artillery as an Observation Post Assistant. His responsibilities included <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> quick drawings of panoramas used to plot targets for the guns.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} are mirror-image duplicates of others, and others die before <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> all the choices in their ruleset, leaving 411 {{distinct}} species (412 if the infinite straight-line worm is included). 336 of these species eventually die. 73 patterns exhibit infinite behaviour, that is, they settle into a repeating pattern that does {{not return to the}} origin. A further two are strongly believed to be infinite and one remains unsolved. Eleven of the rules exhibit complicated behaviour. They do not die even after many billions of iterations, nor do they adopt an obviously infinite pattern. Their ultimate fate was unknown until 2003 when Benjamin Chaffin developed new methods of solving them. After many hours of computer time, nine of the eleven rules were solved, leaving the worms with rules {1,0,4,2,0,2,0} and {1,0,4,2,0,1,5}. The first of these was solved by Tomas Rokicki, who determined that it halts after 57 trillion timesteps, leaving only {1,0,4,2,0,1,5} unsolved. According to Rokicki, the worm is still active after 5.21019 timesteps. He used an algorithm based on Bill Gosper's Hashlife to simulate the worms at extraordinary speeds. This behaviour is considerably more complex than the related rectangular grid worm, which has a longest path of only 16 segments.|$|E
5|$|Milford Haven {{is located}} within the {{geographical}} and historic area known as Little England Beyond Wales, which has predominately used English for many centuries. Although {{it is the most}} westerly point of the country and the part of the county furthest from the English border, a relatively small proportion of the community knows the Welsh language. In the 2011 census, only 7.5% of residents in the Milford Central ward claimed that they could speak, read and write the language, in contrast to the Pembrokeshire county as a whole where roughly 18% of the population are able to read, write and speak Welsh, while in the neighbouring county of Carmarthenshire around 40% of people express a similar level of fluency in Welsh. Local disconnection from the Welsh language was highlighted in November 2008, when Milford Haven Town Council unsuccessfully demanded the right to opt out of a scheme in which official documents had to be translated into Welsh if requested; the council was allegedly one of about 10 that opposed <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such translations.|$|E
5000|$|For the {{signature}} challenge, the bakers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> baklava, {{with a time}} limit of {{three and a half}} hours to complete the challenge.

There <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be twenty layers in their schichttorte, and was one of Paul's recipes. For the showstopper challenge, the bakers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> entremets, very small and fine cakes put in a window of a French pâtisserie. They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> two different types of entremets, twelve of each, and <b>had</b> five hours <b>to</b> complete the challenge.|$|R

5|$|On lap 34, both Hamilton and Vettel came in {{for their}} second and final planned stop, both {{equipping}} the medium tyre set. The undercut worked once more for the Ferrari, as Rosberg emerged behind Vettel one lap later. However, Vettel ran wide on the exit of the final corner on lap 36, letting Rosberg past and damaging his front wing, meaning {{he had to come}} into the pit lane for an unscheduled stop on the next lap, leaving him down in fifth position. His teammate Räikkönen made a second pit stop on lap 40, taking the softer and faster tyres, trying to catch the two Mercedes {{towards the end of the}} race. Fourteen laps before the finish, Räikkönen was fifteen seconds down on second-placed Rosberg, but closing by more than a second per lap. With the Mercedes in front <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their way through backmarkers, Räikkönen was able to cut down the gap even faster, reaching Rosberg with three laps of the race to go. Rosberg, suffering from brake overheating over the entire course of the race, outbraked himself at turn one on lap 56, which allowed Räikkönen to take second place from him. The other Mercedes of Hamilton had brake problems as well towards the end, but was able to control the gap to the Ferrari to take his third victory of the season.|$|E
5|$|The infant Lennon {{started at}} his first school in November 1945— Mosspits, on Mosspits Lane, Wavertree— so she found a {{part-time}} job at a café near the school. After numerous criticisms from the Stanley family about their (still-married) daughter 'living in sin' with John Dykins, and considerable pressure from Mimi—who twice contacted Liverpool's Social Services {{to complain about the}} infant Lennon sleeping in the same bed as Julia and Dykins—she reluctantly handed the care of Lennon over to Mimi and her husband, George Smith. In July1946, Alf visited Mimi's house, 'Mendips' at 251Menlove Avenue, and took Lennon to Blackpool for a long holiday, but he was secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia and Dykins found out and followed them to Blackpool. Alf asked Julia to go with them both to New Zealand, but she refused. After a heated argument, Alf said their five-year-old child had to choose between his mother or him. He chose Alf (twice) so Julia walked away, but in the end her son (crying) followed her, although this story has been disputed. According to author Mark Lewisohn, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home as Alf left again. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said the dramatic scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a decision between his parents never happened. Alf lost contact with the family until Beatlemania, when he and his son met again.|$|E

50|$|For this week's {{signature}} challenge, {{the bakers}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a Frangipane tart in two hours, the brief being {{that it must}} be open-topped and use shortcrust pastry.

25|$|Speech rate {{is closely}} related to {{cognitive}} load of speakers as well. Depending on the cognitive load, the rates of a speaker's utterances are produced either faster or slower, in comparison to a fixed speaking rate which happens usually. For example, speech rate becomes slower when <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> choices that are not anticipated, and tend to accelerate when words are being repeated.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} widely used design tools in the {{profession}} is computer-aided design (CAD) software like CATIA, Autodesk Inventor, DSS SolidWorks or Pro Engineer which enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs.

25|$|Wilson {{wanted to}} {{concentrate}} troops in Britain, Ireland, India and Egypt – {{rather than what}} he saw as excessive commitments to the Rhine and in Mesopotamia, Persia and Palestine, later writing (11 August 1921) that interfering in other countries followed by <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> “peace” was “like buggery: once you take to it, you cannot stop”. However, Keith Jeffery argues that he failed to realise that the granting of self-government to Ireland and Egypt was also necessary, such concession keeping Egypt (like Iraq to a certain extent) pro-British for another generation.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{optimism}} {{of the growing}} city (which did reach one million in 1986), today the Metro is underfunded and does not form the main transport artery of the city. It has had practically no extensions since 1989 (albeit a small shuttle service to a single-platform station in Charbakh). In the city budget, which is still <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> provisions for the repair of the damage done in the horrendous 1988 earthquake, the metro clearly lacks any priority. All of the major works started in the late 1980s are currently frozen.|$|E

25|$|A third {{line was}} planned. It {{was to use}} Canadian National Railway (CN) tracks passing under the Mount Royal to reach the {{northwest}} suburb of Cartierville from the city centre. Unlike the previous two lines, trains were to be partly running above ground. Negotiations with the CN and municipalities were stalling as Montreal was chosen in November 1962 to hold the 1967 Universal Exposition (Expo 67). <b>Having</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a choice, the city decided that a number 4 line linking Montreal to the South Shore suburbs following a plan {{similar to those of}} the early century was more necessary.|$|E
25|$|Frisch {{proved that}} {{variations}} {{in the position of}} the sun {{over the course of a}} day provided bees with an orientation tool. They use this capability to obtain information about the progression of the day deep inside a dark beehive comparable to what is known from the position of the sun. This makes it possible for the bees to convey always up-to-date directional information during their waggle dance, without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a comparison with the sun during long dance phases. This provides them not only with alternative directional information, but also with additional temporal information.|$|E
25|$|A key {{innovation}} {{required for}} the popularization of the BBS was the Hayes Smartmodem. Internal modems like the ones used by CBBS and similar early systems were usable, but generally expensive due to the manufacturer <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a different modem for every computer platform they wanted to target. They were also limited to those computers with internal expansion, {{and could not be}} used with other useful platforms like video terminals. External modems were available for these platforms but required the phone to be dialed using a conventional handset, making them unable to accept incoming calls without manual intervention. Internal modems could be software controlled to perform both outbound and inbound calls, but external modems had only the data pins to communicate with the host system.|$|E
