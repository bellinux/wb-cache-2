5|$|Jon Coghill (born 26 August 1971) is an Australian drummer {{best known}} for his work with Australian rock band, Powderfinger, {{although}} he has also toured with Regurgitator. Coghill replaced Powderfinger's original drummer Steven Bishop in 1991 when Bishop wanted to pursue further studies. At this time, Powderfinger <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> any recordings, and as such, Coghill has been the group's drummer for all of their releases.|$|E
5|$|During {{assembly}} of Collins bow section in Sweden, multiple defects in the hull welding were discovered. Different reasons were given by different parties for the problems: the steel alloy {{used for the}} hull required different welding techniques to those normally used by Kockums; the Swedish navy always requested partial penetration welds for their submarines, while the RAN wanted full penetration welding, but <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> this clear; delays in delivering the steel plates to Kockums resulted in rushed work and a resulting drop in quality. Kockums engineers proposed that the section be kept in Sweden for repairs, but to minimise delays it was accepted as-is, with repairs attempted at ASC during full {{assembly of}} the first boat.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Bakshi reread J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, {{which he}} had first read in high school, and saw {{parallels}} between his situation {{and that of the}} book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Inspired to seek the film rights, he intended to shoot the story's bracketing sequences in live action and to animate the core flashback scenes. Salinger had rejected previous offers to adapt the novel, and <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> a public appearance since 1965 or granted an interview since 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining why he should be allowed to adapt the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.|$|E

5|$|Earp improbably testified {{during the}} {{preliminary}} hearing after the gunfight at the O.K. Corral that he and Behan had made a deal. If Earp withdrew his application to the legislature, Behan agreed to appoint Earp as undersheriff. Behan received the appointment in February 1881, but did not keep {{his end of the}} bargain, and instead chose Harry Woods, a prominent Democrat, as undersheriff. Behan testified at first that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> any deal with Earp, although he later admitted he had lied. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because of an incident that occurred shortly before his appointment.|$|E
5|$|Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin {{had ordered}} all {{settlers}} to stay {{to the east}} of the Divide, as the state and federal governments <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> peace with the Utes. Nevertheless, some defied the order, drawn by the prospect of mining fortunes. Settlers sometimes used Hunter Pass to get to Ashcroft, an early camp on Castle Creek above the Roaring Fork. However, they preferred to take the southern route over the slightly higher Cottonwood Pass through Taylor Park and then back over Taylor Pass to get there, even though this made for a 100-mile (160km) journey, 40 miles (64km) more than the direct route offered by Hunter Pass.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 2016, {{two days}} after his 69th {{birthday}} {{and the release of}} the album Blackstar, Bowie died from liver cancer in his New York City apartment. He had been diagnosed 18 months earlier but <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> the news of his illness public. The Belgian theatre director Ivo van Hove, who had worked with the singer on his Off-Broadway musical Lazarus, explained that Bowie was unable to attend rehearsals due to the progression of the disease. He noted that Bowie had kept working during the illness.|$|E

5|$|Pliny's Natural History {{became a}} model for later encyclopedias and {{scholarly}} works {{as a result of}} its breadth of subject matter, its referencing of original authors, and its index. The work is dedicated to the emperor Titus, a son of Pliny's close friend, the emperor Vespasian, in the first year of Titus's reign. It is the only work by Pliny to have survived, and the last that he published. He began it in 77, and <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> a final revision at the time of his death during the AD79 eruption of Vesuvius.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister George Forbes <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> {{appointments}} to the Legislative Council since 1930, {{with the exception}} of James Parr in 1931, and membership dwindled during the years of the Great Depression. By 1934, the membership had reduced to 19, the lowest since 1860, with two members about to retire. In 1934, 14 new members were appointed by Forbes, including Waite. All appointments became effective on 22 June 1934, and Waite, at age 49, was the second youngest of the intake; only Vincent Ward was younger. Waite was reappointed twice, and served until the abolition of the Upper House in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Rejected by {{his former}} comrades and hunted by the Allies, Himmler {{attempted}} {{to go into}} hiding. He <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> extensive preparations for this, but he had equipped himself with a forged paybook {{under the name of}} Sergeant Heinrich Hitzinger. With a small band of companions, he headed south on 11 May to Friedrichskoog, without a final destination in mind. They continued on to Neuhaus, where the group split up. On 21 May, Himmler and two aides were stopped and detained at a checkpoint set up by former Soviet POWs. Over the following two days, he was moved around to several camps and was brought to the British 31st Civilian Interrogation Camp near Lüneburg, on 23 May.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{minutes after}} the restart, Whelan was penalised for an offence {{on the edge of}} the Liverpool area. Winterburn took the {{resulting}} indirect free kick, from which Alan Smith scored with a header. Liverpool's players protested, claiming Smith <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> contact (and thus the goal should have been disallowed, coming directly from an indirect free kick) or that there had been a push by O'Leary. After consulting his linesman, the referee David Hutchinson awarded the goal. After the match, he recalled none of the Liverpool players knew why they had protested, and TV replays confirm that Smith made contact.|$|E
5|$|The Eriksson {{brothers}} and Johansson {{did not work}} {{much more on the}} game until 1984, when the journalist Erik Fichtelius conducted an interview about the game for the Swedish airline Linjeflyg's magazine Upp, which was distributed to all their airplanes in 1985. In the article, Fichtelius asked Johansson why they <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> the game commercially available for home computers; Johansson said that it had been considered but that they had only developed the game because it was a fun challenge for them, and {{that they would have to}} find a distributor of computer programs if they wanted to create a PC version.|$|E
5|$|The NDH {{government}} struck {{upon the}} idea of trying to re-educate these children to become something akin to an Ustaše version of the Hitler Youth, thereby turning them against their Serb parents. The regime saw this as a more effective way of placing pressure on the Yugoslav Partisan movement than killing the children outright. However, the NDH regime <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> any arrangements to implement this idea, so {{the establishment of a}} children's camp was done in haste, especially as there was strong pressure to do something for the children. NDH regime propaganda advanced the idea that the children were being liberated from slavery {{at the hands of the}} Partisans.|$|E

5|$|The music {{composition}} and recording were handled by underground musicians Falk Au Yeong, Funk Fiction, Andy Tunstall, James Landino, DJ Max-E, Mr. Lange, and Li Xiao'an. Daneluz <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> plans to incorporate original music until Falk approached him requesting collaboration on the game. Funk Fiction has {{claimed that the}} music spans more than twenty genres and was influenced by rock, jazz, disco, and trip hop and the soundtracks of game franchises like Sonic, Donkey Kong, and Kirby. Due to the levels in After the Sequel generally taking longer to complete than those in Before the Sequel, the music tracks are longer, estimated by Falk as ranging from one minute and 45 seconds to three minutes.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} time the two teams had met in the Big 12 Championship Game to {{determine}} the Big12 Conference champion. Nebraska played in the championship game three of the first four years, winning in 1997 and 1999, but <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> it back since. Oklahoma missed the first four games but represented the South Division four of the next six years, topping the conference in 2000, 2002, and 2004. Oklahoma had the most appearances in the championship game (5) and conference titles (4) of any team in the Big12.|$|E
5|$|While {{the cars}} {{waited for the}} restart, work on the cars was allowed and Hamilton's front wing was changed, while Rio Haryanto ended his race. As the race resumed behind the safety car, both Ferrari drivers were running on the super-soft tyre compound, with both Mercedes now {{equipped}} with mediums, which were set to last {{for the rest of}} the race. The running order at the restart was: Vettel, Rosberg, Räikkönen, Ricciardo, Verstappen, Sainz, Hamilton, Massa, Grosjean, Bottas. Grosjean in ninth was the only driver who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> a pit stop before the red flag was shown, which allowed him to save one pit stop and change his tyres during the break.|$|E

5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) has {{everyone}} stay late {{to cover}} for their co-workers in Florida, which turns into an awkward situation when Val's (Ameenah Kaplan) boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), arrives and accuses Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) of {{having an affair with}} her, after having read Darryl's text messages to her. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) demands that Darryl read them aloud out of voyeuristic interest. Upon hearing them, most of the staff agree that his text messages, particularly an extended ellipsis at the end of one, are suggestive of Darryl wanting to be with Val. Val protests that the idea of her being romantically involved with Darryl is ridiculous. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) suggests that he try a bold step, saying that if Jim <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> romantic advances while she was still engaged to Roy, she never would have ended up marrying him. Darryl follows her advice and tells Val that a potential relationship is not ridiculous.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} attempts {{to break through}} the defensive line and reach Lechaeum, Antigonus' force failed and suffered considerable losses. These defeats took such a toll on Antigonus that he considered abandoning his attack of the palisade and moving his army to Sicyon. However, Aratus was visited one evening by some friends from Argos who invited Antigonus to come to their city. The Argives were ready to revolt under the command of Aristoteles, as they were irritated that Cleomenes <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> any reforms in the city. Antigonus sent 1,500 men under the command of Aratus to sail to Epidaurus and, from there, march to Argos. At the same time the Achaean strategos for the year, Timoxenos, advanced with more men from Sicyon. When the Achaean reinforcements arrived, the entire city except for the citadel was {{in the hands of the}} Argives.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a study scrutinised {{two major}} {{populations of the}} Swayne's hartebeest, from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary and the Nechisar National Park, for {{mitochondrial}} (D-loop) and nuclear (microsatellite) variability {{in an attempt to}} estimate the levels of genetic variation between the populations and within the subspecies. The results showed a remarkable differentiation between the two populations; that from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary showed more genetic diversity than the one from the Nechisar National Park. Another revelation was that the translocation of the individuals from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary in 1974 <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>made</b> a significant contribution to the gene pool of the Nechisar National Park. Additionally, the Swayne hartebeest populations were compared with a large red hartebeest population, and both subspecies were found to have a high degree of genetic variation. The study advocated in situ conservation of the Swayne's hartebeest and a renewed attempt at its translocation in order to conserve genetic diversity and increase its population size in both the protected areas.|$|E
