500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> a lot of people and I enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Connor is Sarah's son and {{the future}} leader of the human resistance. He is only 14 {{years old at the}} {{beginning}} of the show, turning fifteen in the season one finale. As the series progresses, John struggles with his feelings for Cameron, who is a Terminator. Dekker was cast after Headey secured the role of Sarah Connor. Regarding the Terminator films, Dekker says [...] "They are like my favorite films when I was younger. So it's very ironic that I'm getting to do this. And I know for the younger generation and for myself, John was equally important to me as Sarah was, and I know a lot of the people that <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> really, really care about John". Dekker describes his character as [...] "a continuation of Eddie Furlong's character" [...] but [...] "he's in a darker, more mature place now".|$|E

Schlessinger first replied that [...] "some people are hypersensitive" [...] and asked for some examples from the caller.

[...] Schlessinger responded that her examples were not racist and that [...] "a lot of blacks only voted for Obama simply because he was half black.

[...] The battle {{took the form of}} skirmishing for several hours as Caldwell directed his sharpshooters to constantly harass the Mexican line, then retreat back to the creek before being discovered. [...] These tactics severely annoyed the Mexicans, who were dying left and right while inflicting only few casualties upon the Texians. Eventually General Woll ordered a full attack with his left and right wings, and so the Mexicans advanced; but they were repulsed within fifteen minutes. Some of the Mexicans made it to twenty steps from the Texian line before being killed. [...] After this failed attack, Woll attempted to rally his men for another, but could not. [...] Later that night, he retreated south toward the border. [...] Woll managed to complete a successful withdrawal by igniting several camp fires to deceive the Texians as to their withdrawal. [...] But when some of Caldwell's men attempted to skirmish with the Mexicans that night, they discovered that Woll had retreated. [...] The battle was over.|$|E
2500|$|Later, on 27 July, Austria-Hungary {{started to}} {{complete}} the preparations for war. That same day, Jagow informed Szögyény {{that he was only}} pretending to take up the British offers of mediation in order to ensure British neutrality but had no intention of stopping the war. Szögyény reported [...] "in order to avoid a misunderstanding" [...] that Jagow had promised him that [...] "the German government assured Austria in the most binding fashion that it in no way identifies itself with the proposal , which may very shortly be brought to Your Excellency 's notice by the German government: it is, on the contrary decidedly opposed to consideration of them and is only passing them on out of deference to the British request" [...] (emphasis in the original). Jagow went on to state he was [...] "absolutely against taking account of the British wish, because [...] "the German government point of view was that it was at the moment of the highest importance to prevent Britain from making common cause with Russia and France. We must therefore avoid any action [...] might cut the line, which has so far worked so well, between Germany and Britain". Szögyény ended his telegram that [...] "If Germany candidly told Grey that it refused to communicate England’s peace plan, that objective [...] might not be achieved." [...] Bethmann Hollweg, in a message to Prince Tschirschky, wrote on 27 July: [...] "As we have already rejected one British proposal for a conference, it is not possible for us to refuse this suggestion also a limine. If we rejected every attempt at mediation, the whole world would hold us responsible for the conflagration and represent us as the real war-mongers. That would also make our position impossible here in Germany, where we have got to appear as though the war had been forced on us. Our position is the more difficult because Serbia seems to have given way very extensively. We cannot therefore reject the role of mediator; we have to pass on the British proposal to Vienna for consideration, especially since London and Paris are continuously using their influence on St. Petersburg." [...] In passing on Grey's message, Bethmann Hollweg deleted the last line, which read: [...] "Also, the whole world here is convinced, and <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> my colleagues that the key to the situation lies in Berlin, and that if Berlin seriously wants peace, it will prevent Vienna from following a foolhardy policy." [...] In his reply to London, Bethmann Hollweg pretended that: [...] "We have immediately initiated mediation in Vienna in the sense desired by Sir Edward Grey." [...] Jagow sent Grey’s offer to Tschirschky, his ambassador in Vienna, but ordered him to not show it to any Austrian official in case they might accept it. At the same time, Bethmann Hollweg sent a distorted account of Grey’s offer to Wilhelm.|$|E
