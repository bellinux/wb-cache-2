Justice Simpson was critical of the Director-General's investigation panel <b>for</b> <b>considering</b> 25 possible causes of the accident but failing to consider that the Department's negligence in licensing a diabetic pilot might have been the root cause of the accident. After the inquiry had received all available information related to Spence's diabetes, Justice Simpson said the insulin reaction of the pilot might have had a considerable bearing on the accident.|$|E
5|$|In a {{major change}} from 2001—when one unnamed former NBA {{executive}} stated that a franchise would not return to Vancouver in his lifetime—Stern revealed in February 2011 that Vancouver was being considered along with Pittsburgh, Tampa and Kansas City. Reasons <b>for</b> <b>considering</b> Vancouver are the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, which for several years in the early 2010s was roughly at par with the U.S. dollar; the influx of international players who would {{be more willing to}} play in Canada; sell-outs for pre-season exhibition games at Rogers Arena (the new name of GM Place); Vancouver having a state-of-the-art venue; and an increased realization among NBA executives that the Vancouver failure was not predominantly because of lack of interest for basketball in Vancouver. The city has also been through a resurrection in professional sports, with the creation of the Vancouver Giants in junior hockey, the 2010 Winter Olympics, and Vancouver Whitecaps FC joining Major League Soccer. However, the location of the city also allows for more varied sports experiences, such as skiing, hunting, fishing and golf, which could partially limit the interest for spectator sports. In addition, the Canadian dollar dramatically weakened against its U.S. counterpart later in the decade, dropping as low as 68 U.S. cents during 2016. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman cited this as a major reason why the league deferred Quebec City's bid to rejoin the NHL.|$|E

25|$|There {{are some}} grounds, Vaillant argues, <b>for</b> <b>considering</b> {{alcoholism}} a medical {{disease in the}} most severe cases. As the disorder worsens, conscious choice becomes less and less important and the alcoholic needs medical assistance to detoxify without risk to life (unlike, for example, heroin, which poses less physical danger to addicts going ‘cold turkey’). In this respect, alcoholism resembles coronary heart disease, which starts as ‘voluntary’, unhealthy behaviours such as poor diet and lack of exercise, but ends in a life-threatening medical condition.|$|E

25|$|Von Hartmann's Philosophy of the Unconscious {{has been}} the subject of many {{different}} estimates, but is regarded as having less intrinsic than historical value. Its influence upon other thinkers was especially marked during the years following its first appearance, but by the early 20th century that influence had much decreased. However, there are some grounds <b>for</b> <b>considering</b> it as providing the connection of thought between Schopenhauer's philosophy of the 'Will' and Sigmund Freud's psychology of the 'unconscious'. In a sense his thought creates the bridge between the Post-Kantian views of Will (in particular Schopenhauer's) and the Zürich school of psychology.|$|E

Third, Michigan's system did not entirely lack mechanisms <b>for</b> <b>considering</b> the individual circumstances of a particular defendant. Prosecutors have discretion in bringing charges, the governor has the power to grant clemency post hoc, and the legislature has the power to retroactively modify the sentence for all persons convicted of Harmelin's crime.|$|E

40|$|Evolution of {{membrane}} potential and spiking activity {{for a single}} leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron in distributed delay framework (DDF) is investigated. DDF provides a mechanism to incorporate memory element in terms of delay (kernel) function into a single neuron models. This investigation includes LIF neuron model with two different kinds of delay kernel functions, namely, gamma distributed delay kernel function and hypo-exponential distributed delay kernel function. Evolution of {{membrane potential}} <b>for</b> <b>considered</b> models is studied in terms of stationary state probability distribution (SPD). Stationary state probability distribution of membrane potential (SPDV) <b>for</b> <b>considered</b> neuron models are found asymptotically similar which is Gaussian distributed. In order to investigate the effect of membrane potential delay, rate code scheme for neuronal information processing is applied. Firing rate and Fano-factor <b>for</b> <b>considered</b> neuron models are calculated and standard LIF model is used for comparative study. It is noticed that distributed delay increases the spiking activity of a neuron. Increase in spiking activity of neuron in DDF is larger for hypo-exponential distributed delay function than gamma distributed delay function. Moreover, in case of hypo-exponential delay function, a LIF neuron generates spikes with Fano-factor less than 1...|$|R

Thermoplastic polymers such as Polyimide (PI), Polyamide (PA, better known as Nylon or Perlon), Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), Siloxane, Polysulfone (PEx) and Aromatic Polyester (FPE) are described in the technical literature as possible dielectric films for capacitors. The primary reason <b>for</b> <b>considering</b> new film materials for capacitors is the relative low permittivity of commonly used materials.
