Exceptional cases are known of least weasels killing prey far larger than themselves, such as capercaillie, hazel hen and hares. In England, a favoured prey item is the field vole (Microtus agrestis). These have fluctuations in population size, and <b>in</b> <b>years</b> of abundance may form up to 54% of the weasel's diet. <b>In</b> <b>years</b> of scarcity, birds form {{a greater proportion of}} the diet and female least weasels may fail to breed.|$|E

5|$|A 2016 {{study by}} {{independent}} environmental consulting group FishBio {{showed that the}} artificial spring pulse flows from New Melones Dam do fairly little to support salmon and steelhead out-migration in the Stanislaus River. Rather, the fish take their cues from increased water flow due to rainfall, as they naturally would have before the many dams on the Stanislaus River were built. In the spring of 2016 about 12,500 juvenile salmon migrated downriver to the sea during April and May, but less than 1percent migrated during the pulse flow. <b>In</b> <b>years</b> of drought when the lake level is low, releasing water during the spring creates consequences {{later in the year}} – because there is not enough cold water left for the autumn spawning run.|$|E
