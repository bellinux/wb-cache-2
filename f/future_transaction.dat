40|$|ABSTRACT: Fluctuations in raw {{material}} and product prices have caused manufacturers and consumers to experience serious losses in steel sector {{as well as}} in all other sectors. As the number of manufacturers of commodities like coking coal, iron ore and scrap- the main {{raw material}}s of steel manufacturing- is less worldwide and their manufacturers do not want to disclose price in an organized market, their <b>future</b> <b>transaction</b> volumes have not developed sufficiently yet. However, <b>future</b> <b>transaction</b> volumes of non-ferrous metals like aluminum, tin etc. that are used as auxiliary raw materials in steel manufacturing have increased fast in organized markets and such style of future transactions have become important in steel manufacturing in terms of cost management. The London Metal Exchange, one of the leading future commodity markets of world, has an important place in management of price risk in steel manufacturing and consumption of derivative transaction contracts. In this study, causality relationship between the price series of non-ferrous metals used as raw materials in steel manufacturing is examined by using Toda and Yamamoto (1995) causality test procedure. Empirical results suggest that aluminum is Granger cause of the other non-ferrous metals...|$|E

30|$|So far, {{many of the}} {{researches}} {{aimed to}} obtain the optimal capacity DGs comprising of either only technical [15, 26] or only economical factors for the TCM problem [28]. Also, the researches in the past did not adopt the weight selection strategies considering multi objectives [26] and aim the optimal capacity DGs for the TCM problem [25]. The optimal sizing of DGs that are obtained by considering technical factors may direct towards the higher investment costs of DG with a little improvement in the technical performances {{of the system and}} may become financial burden which leads to economical infeasibility. Similarly, in case of considering only economical factors, the technical performance may be degraded and may not fulfill the present and <b>future</b> <b>transaction</b> curtailments. Hence, to overcome the above research gaps, in this work authors aimed to obtain the optimal capacities of DGs to improve technical performance along with optimal investment on DG units, which is an important and a new contribution to this field.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} model of {{equilibrium}} contracting between two agents who are "boundedly rational" {{in the sense that}} they face time-costs of deliberating current and <b>future</b> <b>transactions.</b> We show that equilibrium contracts may be incomplete and assign control rights: they may leave some enforceable <b>future</b> <b>transactions</b> unspecified and instead specify which agent has the right to decide these transactions. Control rights allow the controlling agent to defer time-consuming deliberations on those transactions to a later date, making her less inclined to prolong negotiations over an initial incomplete contract. Still, agents tend to resolve conflicts up-front by writing more complete initial contracts. A more complete contract can take the form of either a finer adaptation to future contingencies, or greater coarseness. Either way, conflicts among contracting agents tend to result in excessively complete contracts in the sense that the maximization of joint payoffs would result in less up-front deliberation. ...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{changes in}} {{business}} fluctuations have been gathering attention in Europe and the US in recent years. It {{has become clear}} that business fluctuations in the US began to stabilize {{from the middle of}} the 1980 s, and similar structural changes have been observed in Europe. On the other hand, there have been only a few studies concerning structural changes in Japanese business fluctuations. With this background, this paper presents an analysis as to whether or not there has been a structural change in Japanese business fluctuations in recent years, and if so, when and what kind of change. There are various econometric models for business fluctuations; a common one is the Markov switching model proposed by Hamilton (1989). In this model, it is understood that average growth rates differ between periods of expansion and periods of recession and the shifts between the period of expansion and the period of recession are formulated in accordance with the Markov process. Kim and Nelson (1999) expanded the Markov switching model of Hamilton (1989) considering structural changes and estimated the expanded model by using Bayesian estimation based on Markov chain Monte Carlo. In this paper, maximum likelihood estimation was performed by changing the points of structural change for each period in the model of Kim and Nelson (1999) and the period for which the likelihood becomes the highest is estimated as the point of structural change. The variables for Japanese business fluctuations used in this paper are composite index (CI) and the index of industrial production (IIP) published by the Economic and Social Research Institute of the Cabinet Office of the government of Japan. To focus on structural change in recent years, the sample period was March 1980 to November 2003. It was estimated that the points in time of structural change in business fluctuations were April 1989, based on CI, and January 1992, based on IIP. The analysis also revealed that structural changes were statistically significant for both of the variables. In more detail, average growth rates showed significant reductions for the recession period and for the expansion period, and increases in the amplitudes of business fluctuations and dispersion of short-term deviation from business fluctuations. The estimated points in time of the structural changes, April 1989 and January 1992, are almost the same as, or just after, the time of commencement of the Nikkei 225 <b>futures</b> <b>transactions.</b> Nikkei 225 <b>futures</b> <b>transactions</b> were blamed for lowering stock prices in Japan, thereby increasing stock price volatility, because stock prices started to drop significantly at the beginning of the 1990 s. This paper also presents an analysis of the effect of Nikkei 225 <b>futures</b> <b>transactions</b> on stock price fluctuations and business fluctuations in Japan. More concretely, an analysis was performed to determine whether or not there are any Granger causalities between trading volume or open interest of Nikkei 225 <b>futures</b> <b>transactions</b> and the levels of the Nikkei 225 stock index, CI, IIP or their volatility. The analysis revealed no significant interactions. Therefore, Nikkei 225 <b>futures</b> <b>transactions</b> were not the cause of the instability of stock price fluctuations or business fluctuations in Japan.

This paper estimates significant effects from these information spillovers on the export patterns of fourteen developing countries, and somewhat smaller effects for a sample of exporters from six developed countries. On the other hand, it is in developed countries’ markets that the largest information spillovers are generated. Indeed, increases in market share in the United States allows for significant increases in exports to the rest-of-the world associated with information spillovers. But developing country markets could also generate important amounts of information for regional exporters. Hong Kong is the top market in terms of generating information for other East Asian exporters, and the Argentinean and Chilean markets play an important role for exporters from other Latin American countries.
