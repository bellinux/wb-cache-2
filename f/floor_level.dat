5|$|Due to {{the slope}} of the site, the south façade, which overlooks {{the main part of the}} grounds, stands on a raised and terraced {{platform}} with the ground floor raised to first <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> and the basement becoming the ground floor. Above the terrace, the façade has the same general arrangement as the north façade, but the wings project slightly past the central section, which has a two-storey pedimented portico. Each wing previously had a single-storey bay at its centre but these have been removed.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the original building is attributed to Nicholas Hawksmoor, with some alterations from around 1900 and the subsequent modern 1960s extensions. The original mansion is in the Queen Anne style. The house itself has three storeys constructed of red brick. The ground <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> has a rubbed brick band at nine courses, and another rubbed brick band exists on the second floor, along with a moulded stone cornice level with the sills.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of {{the west}} range – the cellarer's range – are extant. It was entered from the west by an outer parlour, {{projecting}} from {{the north end of}} the range, where members of the community received visitors. The prior lived on the upper floor which comprised a hall, chamber and chapel dedicated to Saint Hilda. The prior's rooms were probably located above the outer parlour, as was the pattern at other monasteries, accessing the cloister and the outside world. The largest surviving fragment of the range comprises a cellarium or storehouse where supplies were kept. It is a vaulted undercroft of nine bays constructed from stone ashlar with its <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> below that of the cloister. It is relatively well-preserved and believed to have been divided by timber partitions which were later replaced in stone.|$|E

50|$|On {{the western}} bay {{there are three}} {{centrally}} positioned long narrow windows at ground and first <b>floor</b> <b>levels,</b> and above these a round vent with hood mould. On the north elevation there are sets of four double hung timber windows symmetrically positioned at the ground and first <b>floor</b> <b>levels,</b> these have window hoods with scalloped fascias.|$|R
5|$|South of {{the great}} hall was a two-storey {{building}} containing withdrawing chambers, dating from around 1200. Narrow windows opening onto the bailey were original but have since been filled in. The first floor was entirely occupied by the great chamber, furnished with a fireplace. In the south-west {{corner of the room}} was a door to a small room which was perhaps used as a safe. The ground floor was used as a cellar, through which the Carrickfergus Tower could be accessed. The polygonal tower was also accessible through the great chamber at first <b>floor</b> <b>level.</b> Fitted with latrines and a fireplace, it was an extension of the lordly accommodation provided by the great chamber.|$|E
5|$|The Sydney Hotel {{was built}} within the gardens. It {{later became the}} Holburne Museum. The {{original}} design for the hotel, prepared by Thomas Baldwin in 1794, was a two-storey building which would serve the pleasure gardens. After Baldwin was bankrupted his design for the hotel was not implemented. Instead a three-storey building was designed by Charles Harcourt Masters. The foundation stone was laid in 1796 and the building was ready by 1799. Visitors entered the gardens through the Hotel. Projecting {{from the rear of}} the building at first <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> was a conservatory and a semi-circular orchestra with a wide covered loggia below. Two semi-circular rows of supper boxes projected from the sides of the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{more severe}} north front is of eleven bays, {{with the end}} bays given {{significance}} by rustication at ground <b>floor</b> <b>level.</b> The centre of the façade has Ionic columns supporting a pediment and originally had the Dashwood coat of arms. This façade is thought to date from around 1750–51, although its segmented windows suggest {{it was one of}} the first of the 2nd Baronet's improvements to the original house to be completed, as the curved or segmented window heads are symbolic of the earlier part of the 18th century; the design has been given to Isaac Ware.|$|E

5|$|The square Little Stair Tower was the {{entrance}} from the bailey to the withdrawing rooms {{south of the}} great hall. At ground <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> there was a doorway {{in each of the}} tower's faces. Directly south of {{the east side of the}} tower was the castle's chapel. The northern door led to the great hall, and the western door to a cellar under the great chamber. There are only fragmentary remains of the spiral staircase. Above the passageway was a single room, of uncertain purpose: it may have been used as another chapel, a guest room, or an antechamber where guests would wait before being admitted into the earl's presence.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} of the other GNP stations, the station {{building}} was designed by Leslie Green, though at Holborn the station frontage was, uniquely, constructed in stone rather than the standard red glazed terracotta. This was due to planning regulations imposed by the London County Council which required the use of stone for façades in Kingsway. The station entrance and exit sections of the street façade were constructed in granite with the other parts of the ground and first floors in the same style, but using Portland stone. The rest of the building above first <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> was constructed contemporaneously with the station. Access to the platform levels of the station was provided by trapezium-shaped electric lifts manufactured by Otis in America. These operated in pairs in shared circular shafts, with an escape stair in a separate, smaller shaft.|$|E
5|$|Before the Tang Dynasty (618907 AD), the {{predominant}} sitting {{positions in the}} Han Chinese culture and neighboring cultures such as the Japanese Culture, Korean Culture, Turkic Culture in Central Asia and Tai Kadai Cultures to the southwest were the seiza and lotus position on the floor or sitting mats. The earliest images of chairs in China are from sixth-century Buddhist murals and stele, but the practice of sitting in chairs {{at that time was}} rare. It was not until the twelfth century that chairs became widespread in China. Scholars disagree on the reasons for the adoption of the chair. The most common theories are that the chair was an outgrowth of indigenous Chinese furniture, that it evolved from a camp stool imported from Central Asia, that it was introduced to China by Nestorian missionaries in the seventh century, and that the chair came to China from India as a form of Buddhist monastic furniture. In modern China, unlike Korea or Japan, it is not common to sit at <b>floor</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A two {{dimensional}} layout with divisions that show {{distribution of the}} system between building levels, or an isometric-style layout that shows distribution of systems across individual <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Several {{types of}} {{irregular}} construction styles {{were incorporated into}} the building that contributed to its mass and strength not being uniform throughout the structure. These differences in strength allowed damage to be concentrated {{in one or more}} areas rather than being distributed equally and reduced the building's ability to sustain the tremors. Two of the irregularities of the building were the end shear walls that stopped below the second floor and the first floor carrying its load via square support columns. The result of the design was that the first floor was less stiff than the upper floors, and during the earthquake the building sustained uneven damage distribution, a condition that may have led to the complete collapse of the building in a larger earthquake. Because of its failure at the foundation and first <b>floor</b> <b>level,</b> the building was considered a total loss and was ultimately demolished.|$|E
5|$|Stela 4 {{was found}} in the {{northern}} part of the East Plaza. It was the only monument at El Chal to have been sculpted on both sides and had been moved from its original location. Due to its sculptural style and its location, it is believed to have been associated with Altars 3 and 4. The upper portion of the front of the stela bears a hieroglyphic text with a calendrical date that has been interpreted as 9.16.10.0.0. 1 Ahau 3 Zip (17 March 761) together with the site's Emblem Glyph. This side of the stela depicts a Maya bloodletting ritual with a richly dressed person standing with legs apart standing on top of three sitting prisoners, the middle of which bears his own name written upon his left leg. The principal figure bears a spear topped by a serpent head with a flint spearhead emerging from it. This spear is very similar in style to one depicted on Stela 8 at Naranjo. The reverse of the stela depicts three individuals standing upon a monster mask seen in profile. A child or youth is seated before two adult figures. All of them wear rectangular headdresses and hold something in their hands that cannot now be distinguished. Hieroglyphic texts are carved above the heads of the two standing figures and probably represent their names. The sculptural style of the two sides is different, and the foot-level of the standing figures on each side is different, with the figures on the reverse being positioned higher up the shaft than the figure on the front. This probably indicates that both sides were sculpted in situ at different times, with the reverse of the stela being crafted after the <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> of the plaza had risen to cover the base of the front side.|$|E
25|$|The {{first stage}} of {{construction}} is represented in the stonework up to <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> in the nave and apse, comprising random rubble to about one metre above ground level.|$|E
5000|$|The library {{occupies}} {{an independent}} wing with two <b>floor</b> <b>levels.</b> The lower level {{belongs to the}} circulation & issue section while the upper level belongs to the reference section.|$|R
50|$|The {{stonework}} of {{the house}} bears witness to various changes to the <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> and layout {{over the course of}} the building's history. The windows were enlarged in the 18th century.|$|R
50|$|In 1990 Tattersalls was {{refurbished}} with altered <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> {{at a cost}} of $5,000,000. A new Queen Street entrance was constructed, {{and incorporated}} a vaulted ceiling and the Daphne Mayo friezes from the original entry.|$|R
25|$|The {{museum is}} square in plan {{with the main}} body of the {{galleries}} raised on piloti to first <b>floor</b> <b>level.</b> The layout is influenced by Le Corbusier's Sanskar Kendra museum in Ahmedabad which was being designed at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{difference is that}} the icons do not start from the <b>floor</b> <b>level.</b> Altarpieces, that were not part of the original structure, stand between the holy doors instead. And the lifelike portraits typical of Western style are seldom found on Eastern icon screens.|$|E
25|$|Nothing {{remains of}} the {{original}} interior decoration of the church, which contemporary chroniclers describe as being covered in mosaics with walls of variegated marble. During the Ottoman conversion into a mosque, the windows and entrance were modified, <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> raised, and interior walls plastered.|$|E
50|$|In 1984 {{excavations}} have unearthed {{the remains}} of the pre- and post-Augustan <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> - the portico was still in use in the 5th century but in the 6th century it was used for burials.|$|R
50|$|Other {{than the}} {{internal}} stair, access is gained to this upper floor balcony via an external steel staircase. The <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> differ between the later extensions and the 1935 building core, the former being lower.|$|R

25|$|In No. 52 Inge Street/ 2 Court 15 {{only one}} {{original}} stairway remains — {{from the ground}} {{to the first floor}} in the front house. The stair in No. 54 Inge Street has been removed at ground <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> but in No. 3 Court 15 the complete staircase survives.|$|E
25|$|The {{passenger}} trailers {{were each}} 55 feet long while the parcel trailers were 42 feet long. All cars featured a full-length side skirt below the <b>floor</b> <b>level,</b> partially coverying the bogies and underfloor equipment. They were all {{painted in the}} same silver and blue livery as the power cars.|$|E
25|$|There are shops on {{the ground}} <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> and {{at the level of}} the row. The house above is open free of charge to {{visitors}} at advertised times. It has two large meeting rooms which are available to hire. The building contains the headquarters of the Chester Civic Trust.|$|E
50|$|The castle {{consists}} of a polygonal enceinte enclosing a cylindrical keep, 8.5 meters in diameter and 22m high. Constructed from stone rubble, it is divided into five <b>floored</b> <b>levels.</b> The top <b>floor</b> {{is the only one}} to be lit; the others are pierced by arrowslits in niches. In a corner of the curtain wall, slightly lower, is a second, square, tower. Habitable and measuring 8.5 m square, it is divided like the keep into five <b>floored</b> <b>levels,</b> lit by rectangular windows. Heavily thickened at the base, its walls are 22.8 m high and 1.55 m thick. Various buildings attached to the ramparts are spread around the courtyard.|$|R
50|$|Incorporated in {{the later}} wing, and {{disguised}} on the south western face with subsequent arcading, is an early two storeyed building housing music practice rooms. These are located centrally, and are apparent on the north eastern facade. The building is of rendered brick and has an ornamental roof ventilator centrally located on the steeply pitched hipped roof. Small rectangular window openings line the north eastern face. The <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> of this building are not aligned with the <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> of the surrounding buildings, therefore small internal staircases provide access to the rooms. The music practice rooms, themselves, are evident {{on the ground floor}} of this building.|$|R
50|$|At {{the north}} western {{corner of the}} {{building}} a basement level has been more recently added through the underpinning of the original walls and the addition of a new end wall and contains several different <b>floor</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|R
