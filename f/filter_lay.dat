40|$|Keywords: {{ferroelectric}} {{liquid crystal}}s, nematic liquid crystals, Lyot-Öhman filter A conventional liquid crystal device {{consisting of two}} crossed polarizers and a liquid crystal cell displays a transmission in function of wavelength with different minima and maxima. By putting {{a number of these}} devices in series, with each step a different retardation (typically in each stage, the retardation doubles) a Lyot-Öhman filter can be fabricated [1 - 4]. Such a multistage filter shows a narrow transmission peak in function of wavelength. By changing the voltage on the different liquid crystal cells, the transmission peak will shift to other wavelengths. In this work, instead of aiming at a narrow transmission peak, we fabricate a filter that switches rapidly between either the visible or the near-infrared spectrum. The wavelength range of both the transmission band and stop band must be as wide as possible, while the bistable switching must be as fast as possible. The filter will be used in combination with a CCD-imaging system to take alternating pictures in the visible and near-infrared. The applications for such a <b>filter</b> <b>lay</b> in various fields such as astronomy [5], food and product inspection and medicine...|$|E

Such epithelia cultured on Nuclepore <b>filters</b> will also <b>lay</b> down a stroma containing 20 nm diameter fibrils, although there is only limited orthogonal organisation. We report here that collagen fibril morphology is critically dependent on the pH of the medium in which the corneal epithelium is cultured and that normal 20 nm diameter fibrils only assemble in a narrow band around neutral pH (approx. 6. 9 - 7. 4). At higher pH (7. 6 - 8. 1), fibrils in the distal region of the stroma more closely resemble those seen in non-corneal stroma as their diameters can be up to 200 nm even though fibrils near the basal lamina are only about 10 nm in diameter. At low pH (approx. 6. 5), there are again wide fibrils, but with the hieroglyphic cross-sections typical of those seen in heritable disorders of N-terminal procollagen processing. Biochemical analysis by SDS-PAGE and fluorography confirms that N-terminal procollagen processing is deficient at this pH. At very low pH (approx. 5. 8 - 6. 2), there is little processing of procollagen and the stroma comprises filamentous material with the occasional banded structures typical of those formed by unprocessed procollagen at high concentration. Gel electrophoresis and peptide mapping showed that the collagens produced by the corneal epithelium of the primary stroma included types I, II and V and that total collagen production, as assessed by incorporation of [3 H]proline, increased with pH, although the relative amounts of the different collagens produced remained essentially unchanged. While the biochemical data can account for the altered morphologies in the pH range 5. 8 to 7. 0, the sensitivity of fibril diameter to small changes around neutral pH remains unexplained, but points to the subtle, charge-based interactions necessary {{for the formation of}} 20 nm diameter fibrils in the developing cornea.
