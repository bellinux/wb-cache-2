40|$|Some {{problems}} of cosmology: {{the big bang}} singularity, the origin of conventional matter, of dark matter and of dark energy may be successfully described and treated {{in the framework of}} the Weyl-Dirac theory. This theory, being a minimal expansion of Einstein's GRT, contains in addition to the metric tensor, the Weyl connection vector and the Dirac gauge functionβ. From these geometrically based quantities one obtains the behavior of our universe. The Weyl connection vector existing in microcells creates dark matter particles, weylons. In the very early universe β creates matter, whereas in the present dust period β forms dark energy, the latter causing cosmic acceleration. Around a massive body the - dark energy form a ball-like concentration having negative mass and negative pressure. These β-balls cause an additional acceleration of the expanding universe. The Weyl-Dirac theory is a classical geometrically based framework appropriate for describing and searching cosmology.

40|$|This paper {{initially}} explored how the 1960 s and 1970 s Land Artists influenced {{a subsequent}} generation of (often international) artists working in Grizedale Forest, England. It subsequently considers how analogue and digital media have affected these artist’s site-related practices. Grizedale’s artist’s residency program, specifically inspired by American Land Art, was initiated in 1977. It {{was one of}} UK’s first initiatives exploring how location-specific Land Art may be interpreted here/there (<b>delete</b> <b>as</b> <b>appropriate),</b> given that the earlier artists’ preoccupations might lose relevance with geographic, cultural, and temporal translocation. Where does the local(e) reside, and what may occur through these translocations? Grizedale’s artists initially adopted the spirit of Beardsley’s dictum by working exclusively with materials sourced in the Forest, which also acted as their home, studio and exhibition space. This formula successfully launched the (international) careers of artists such as Andy Goldsworthy. There have also been considerable changes: since 1999 Grizedale has taken several new media-driven directions, including commissioned billboards, online projects and video work. The shift from analogue to digital media – what McLuhan calls mechanical and electric technologies – since 1977 is important when {{living and working in}} isolated forests. Digital’s immediacy when working miles away from photo laboratories or darkrooms, means that imagery can be created and disseminated virtually simultaneously, often blurring the distinctions between making, presenting and documenting site related artwork. Burnham’s argument about the art object slowly disappearing still resonates, but how have the subsequent ‘systems consciousness’(es) such Google Earth, Satnav and the Internet, created super-complexity for Grizedale’s artists and audiences alike?

40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} are {{leading causes of}} mortality in Western society and countries adopting an Occidental Life style (1). Restoration of the circulation via bypass surgical treatment {{is regarded as the}} gold standard treatment of peripheral vascular diseases, and requires (vascular/tissue/circulatory/blood vessel - <b>delete</b> <b>as</b> <b>appropriate)</b> grafts. Normally the great saphena vein is used as (a/the) “donor” blood vessel. It is collected from its superficial location on the leg and used in case of auto-transplantation in coronary artery bypass operations, and also for peripheral arterial bypass operations. Autologous great saphenous veins are often not available, and synthetic grafts have their limitations. Therefore novel techniques to produce alternative grafts have been developed, including tissue engineering which is a promising alternative to provide biocompatible grafts. Our aim is to reconstruct the endothelium layer of decellularized vein scaffolds using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and growth factors. The use of allo/xenogenic material as a scaffold for donors has previosuly been embraced by the scientific community (2), and standardised procedures have been developed that consists of a decellularization phase of the donor element, a re-seeding phase of the decellularized scaffold and an implant phase on the host (3). In particular the opportunity to use a decellularized blood vessel as a scaffold for vascular tissue engineering, and the saphena vein specifically, is something well known (4 - 5). Our project concerns the development of blood vessel substitutes to be used mainly in arteriovenous fistulae surgery. We propose to develop a procedure that automates the initial phases (decellularization and re-seeding) to reduce the manipulation of the vein and to promote a more efficient and natural cell seeding. We have developed a specific bioreactor linked with a rotary infusion pump to create a closed circuit in which the donated saphena vein was integrated during the decellularization phase. We have enabled a flow of SDS (0. 1...|$|E
