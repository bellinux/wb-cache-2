5|$|Warren {{convened a}} meeting of the justices, and {{presented}} to them the simple argument that the only reason to sustain segregation was an <b>honest</b> <b>belief</b> in the inferiority of Negroes. Warren further submitted that the Court must overrule Plessy to maintain its legitimacy as an institution of liberty, and it must do so unanimously to avoid massive Southern resistance. He began to build a unanimous opinion.|$|E
5|$|Section 1(3) of the 1971 Act {{specifies}} that offences {{under section}} 1, where the destruction or damage {{is caused by}} fire, shall be charged as arson. It would seem that courts adopt a purposive view {{in relation to the}} lawful excuse defence in relation to arson, as in R v. Hunt (1977). The defendant, wishing to highlight the lack of fire defences in an old people's home, set fire to it to demonstrate the risks. He claimed an <b>honest</b> <b>belief</b> in that by doing this, he had a lawful excuse within section 5(2). It was held, however, that he had not actually been acting so as to protect property. Although the court assumed that his belief was honest, it ruled that his intention was to draw attention to faulty fire defences rather than to defend the property itself.|$|E

25|$|At common law, no {{judge of}} a {{superior}} court or inferior court is liable in damages if acting within jurisdiction, {{even if he}} or she does so maliciously. Further, no judge of a superior court is liable for an act done outside jurisdiction, provided that this was done by the judge in the <b>honest</b> <b>belief</b> that the act was within jurisdiction. Liability only attaches in such cases if the judge knowingly acts outside jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|The {{duty of care}} {{requires}} control {{persons to}} act on an informed basis after due consideration of all information. The duty includes a requirement that such persons reasonably inform themselves of alternatives. In doing so, they may rely on employees and other advisers {{so long as they}} do so with a critical eye and do not unquestionably accept the information and conclusions provided to them. Under normal circumstances, their actions are accorded the protection of the business judgment rule, which presumes that control persons acted properly, provided that they act on an informed basis, in good faith and in the <b>honest</b> <b>belief</b> that the action taken was {{in the best interests of}} the company.|$|E
40|$|This study {{included}} the interviews of 10 public school personnel. Participants consisted of four support staff and six general education elementary school teachers. Each {{member of the}} study was asked a series of questions to better understand the discrepancies of certain ethnic populations in special education. Participants were encouraged to share <b>honest</b> <b>beliefs</b> contributing to and combating this problem in their local elementary school and individual classroom. Their answers were then compiled and examined to identify common themes present throughout all interviews. Results revealed that teachers interviewed knew many perceived solutions to the overrepresentation of ethnic populations in special education. Common themes were: parent communication, student support teams, collaboration, teacher training in differentiated methodology, high expectations for students, increased motivation, and school-wide intervention programs.

50|$|A clear {{illustration}} of an affirmative defense is self defense. In its simplest form, a criminal defendant may be exonerated {{if she can}} demonstrate that she had an <b>honest</b> and reasonable <b>belief</b> that another's use of force was unlawful and that the defendant's conduct was necessary to protect herself.|$|R
500|$|Section 5(3) of the Act {{states that}} it is {{immaterial}} whether the defendant's belief is justified {{as long as it}} is an <b>honest</b> <b>belief,</b> and therefore creates a subjective test to be assessed by the court or jury. In Chamberlain v. Lindon (1998), Lindon demolished a wall to protect a right of way, honestly believing that it was a reasonable means of avoiding litigation. It was said that: ...|$|E

50|$|Imperfect self-defense is {{a common}} law {{doctrine}} recognized by some jurisdictions whereby a defendant may mitigate punishment or sentencing imposed for a crime involving the use of deadly force by claiming, as a partial affirmative defense, the <b>honest</b> but unreasonable <b>belief</b> that the actions were necessary to counter an attack.|$|R
5000|$|Imperfect self-defense: In some jurisdictions, {{a person}} who acted in self-defense with an <b>honest</b> but {{unreasonable}} <b>belief</b> that deadly force was necessary to do so can reduce a murder charge to one of voluntary manslaughter or deliberate homicide committed without criminal malice. Malice is found {{if a person is}} killed intentionally and without legal excuse or mitigation.|$|R

40|$|This study {{included}} the interviews of 15 public school co-teachers from 3 different {{high schools in}} the Temecula Valley Unified School District consisting of members form 9 co-teaching teams Participants consisted of 8 general educators and 7 special educators, some participants had more than one co-teaching partner, in this event both partners were interviewed. Each member of the study was asked a series of questions to better understand; how to create a positive learning environment, management of student learning and behavior, their use of the four co-teaching approaches, supportive, parallel, complementary and team teaching. Participants were encouraged to share <b>honest</b> <b>beliefs</b> to all 15 questions. Their answers were then compiled and examined to identify common themes present throughout all interviews, themes unique to general educators and themes unique to special educators. Results revealed that there were more common themes than unique themes. Common themes were: job assignment, non identification of students, two teachers available for help, fun and enthusiasm, involvement of both teachers, mutual respect, students liked co-teaching classes, immediate and consistent behavior management, standards set early, no differentiation in expectations, high expectations for all students, oral and creative assessments, supportive teaching usually practiced with general educator as the curricular expert, split class and cooperative group monitor most often used for the parallel approach, complementary teaching approach used 100 % for class management, shared grading and planning, complementary and team-teaching preferred, informal planning, common prep time, proximity of teacher location, need for administrative support...|$|R

60|$|From the Speaker {{the warning}} leaked {{out to all}} the creatures in the House that wore the scarlet livery. They knew, while Ernest was speaking, that some violent act was to be committed. And to do them justice, they {{honestly}} believed that the act was to be committed by the socialists. At the trial, and still with <b>honest</b> <b>belief,</b> several testified to having seen Ernest prepare to throw the bomb, and that it exploded prematurely. Of course they saw nothing of the sort.

5000|$|Another court, in Maryland, held that: When {{evidence}} is presented showing the defendant’s subjective {{belief that the}} use of force was necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm, the defendant is entitled to a proper instruction on imperfect self defense....The theory underlying the doctrine is that when a defendant uses deadly force with an <b>honest</b> but unreasonable <b>belief</b> {{that it is necessary to}} defend himself, the element of malice, necessary for a murder conviction, is lacking.|$|R
500|$|However, in R v. Hill and Hall (1989), the Court of Appeal {{introduced}} an objective element to part (b) of the defence. The defendants {{had been convicted}} of possession of a hacksaw blade outside a US naval base in Wales, having admitted an intention to use the blade to cut through the base's perimeter fence. They claimed a lawful excuse in that they had acted to protect their own property located near the base; their reasoning was that the base would {{at some point in the}} future attract a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union. Given that Hill was [...] "forced to admit that she did not expect a nuclear bomb to fall today or tomorrow", the Court concluded that this threat to property was too remote and thus the defence had not been made out, however <b>honest</b> the <b>belief</b> had been.|$|R

60|$|But if {{the social}} {{condition}} of the civilised world was anomalous {{at the beginning of}} the fifth century, its spiritual state was still more so. The universal fusion of races, languages, and customs, which had gone on for four centuries under the Roman rule, had produced a corresponding fusion of creeds, an universal fermentation of human thought and faith. All <b>honest</b> <b>belief</b> in the old local superstitions of paganism had been long dying out before the more palpable and material idolatry of Emperor-worship; and the gods of the nations, unable to deliver those who had trusted in them, became one by one the vassals of the 'Divus Caesar,' neglected by the philosophic rich, and only worshipped by the lower classes, where the old rites still pandered to their grosser appetites, or subserved the wealth and importance of some particular locality.|$|E
6000|$|Undoubtedly that varying {{compound}} {{of some of}} the best and some of the worst elements of Paganism and Judaism, moulded in practice by the innate character of certain people of the Western world, which, since the second century, has assumed to itself the title of orthodox Christianity, [...] "rests on miracles" [...] and falls to the ground, not [...] "if miracles be impossible," [...] but if those to which it is committed prove themselves unable to fulfil the conditions of <b>honest</b> <b>belief.</b> That this Christianity is doomed to fall is, to my mind, beyond a doubt; but its fall will be neither sudden nor speedy. The Church, with all the aid lent it by the secular arm, took many centuries to extirpate the open practice of pagan idolatry within its own fold; and those who have travelled in southern Europe will be aware that it has not extirpated the essence of such idolatry even yet. Mutato nomine, it is probable that there is as much sheer fetichism among the Roman populace now as there was eighteen hundred years ago; and if Marcus Antonius could descend from his horse and ascend the steps of the Ara Coeli church about Twelfth Day, the only thing that need strike him would be the extremely contemptible character of the modern idols as works of art.|$|E
50|$|In New South Wales, abortions are {{unlawful}} under sections 82-84 of the Crimes Act 1900, but {{the interpretation}} of the law is subject to the Levine ruling, from R v Wald of 1971, itself derived from the Victorian Menhennitt ruling, which held an abortion to be legal if a doctor had an <b>honest</b> and reasonable <b>belief</b> that, due to 'any economic, social or medical ground or reason', the abortion was necessary to 'preserve the woman involved from serious danger to her life or physical or mental health which the continuance of the pregnancy would entail'.|$|R

50|$|The {{subjective}} standard and objective standard are legal standards for knowledge or beliefs of {{a defendant in}} a criminal law case. An objective standard of reasonableness requires the finder of fact to view the circumstances {{from the standpoint of}} a hypothetical reasonable person, absent the unique particular physical and psychological characteristics of the defendant. A {{subjective standard}} of reasonableness asks whether the circumstances would produce an <b>honest</b> and reasonable <b>belief</b> in a person having the particular mental and physical characteristics of the defendant, such as their personal knowledge and personal history, when the same circumstances might not produce the same in a general reasonable person.|$|R
