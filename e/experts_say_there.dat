Security <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> are now up to 300 IED attacks a month in other countries around the world.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{comparison}} of corporate social responsibility in mining industry. It compares specific territorial areas of two different countries – one of them country that could be called as semi-periphery or even core country and the second one a periphery country. The first one is Czech Republic (Northern Bohemia area) and the second one is Zambia (Copperbelt area). CSR activities in Copperbelt have played primarily an ameliorative role {{in the context of}} significant social disruption and uncertainty in the wake of privatization. Some <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> are still important gaps between mining companies’ CSR activities, on the one hand, and accountability and fairness, on the other. The CSR concept is relatively new in the Czech Republic – but more and more discussed and interesting for many firms. The Czech company “Severočeské doly” was one of the finalists of the national round of the competition “The European Corporate (Social) Responsibility Award” in 2007. The aim {{of this paper is to}} find the opportunities the companies working in this industry use, and how the system of CSR is developed. It analysis the areas they concentrate on in their CSR activities and compares it with theoretical concept. The comparison is based on secondary data as well as on personal experience of visiting both of these areas and companies...|$|E
40|$|Upplandsbondens (UB) is {{a farmer}} owned {{cooperative}} that {{was established in}} 2006. There are approximately 100 members. All members are organically certified meat-producing farmers (beef, mutton, pork) in the county of Uppland, Sweden (figure 1). UB is certified according to the organic certification KRAV, the Swedish organic standard, which is somewhat harsher on e. g. animal husbandry than the EU organic regulation. The overall value chain in which {{the bulk of the}} meat is channelled is comprised of the farmers, the UB cooperative (in which only farmers are members), slaughterhouses, meat wholesalers, retail shops and consumers. UB negotiates prices and looks for market solutions for its members. Market partners have changed throughout the years. The largest volumes of meat are channelled via a large meat wholesaler based in Stockholm, to supermarkets all over Sweden (a national retailer). This meat is sold under the retailer’s own organic brand and thus the meat cannot be identified as UB meat. UB has its own brand for meat that is processed and sold in the Uppland region only. During the time of the case study data collection (2014), only retail shops that could cut up and package their meat themselves could sell under this brand since the wholesaler UB works with locally did not yet have the facilities to cut and package. Thus, only a minor part of the meat from UB members can be identified as such. Other (smaller) volumes of the meat are sold directly to consumers in meat-boxes 1, to a restaurant wholesaler or in public procurement processes. Many of the member farmers also sell meat directly from their farms, but this is outside of the UB value chain. Figure 1. Map of Sweden and the county of Uppland (just north of the Greater Stockholm region), where all 107 UB farms are located. 1 Discontinued since Autumn 2014 because the meat box entrepreneur went out of business. 5 UB is interesting in the HealthyGrowth project for several reasons. First, while regional organic food is not new in Sweden, it is a small market and larger efforts such as UB are still very scarce. Second, despite the fact that many <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> is great demand for regional/local organic food, {{and despite the fact that}} the UB farmers want to deliver just that, they experience significant obstacles in reaching their local consumers and have been trying in different ways since the start. Third, the potential for a mid-scale initiative such as UB in the Stockholm metropolitan area, and in a context where Uppsala municipality has decided to procure 100 % organic food, is very large and thus interesting to follow. Finally, UB is interesting since it is an initiative based on cooperative ideals, in a market dominated by profit-seeking businesses. The value chain in focus is the one that UB wants to develop: where their meat is sold under their own brand to retailers in the Uppland region via a regional meat wholesaler...|$|E

40|$|Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), {{with the}} support of the Division of Vector-borne Diseases of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (DVBD, CDC), created a working group and convened a meeting in Lima, Peru, on July 21 - 23, 2010, to discuss the threat this virus {{represents}} and to examine measures that might be taken to mitigate this vii threat (see Appendix I for additional details on the meeting). These preparedness guidelines are the result of this collaboration. The contents of this document were written by J. Erin Staples, Ann Powers, Kay Tomashek, Robert S. Lanciotti, Elizabeth Hunsperger, Jorge Munoz, Harry Savage, John-Paul Mutebi, Roberto Barrera, Emily Zielinski-Gutierrez, Carmen Perez, and Roger S. Nasci of the DVBD, CDC. The publication of these guidelines was possible thanks to funding from the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), in collaboration with the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has published new guidelines on chikungunya, a mosquito-transmitted virus transmitted that causes fever and severe joint pain. The Guidelines for Preparedness and Response for Chikungunya Virus Introduction in the Americas aims to help countries throughout the Americas improve their ability to detect the virus and be prepared to monitor, prevent, and control the disease, should it appear. Hundreds of people who have traveled from the Americas to Asia and Africa in the past five years have become infected with the chikungunya virus. While the virus has not spread locally in the Western Hemisphere, <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> is a clear risk of its introduction into local mosquito populations. Local transmission could occur if mosquito populations in the United States or elsewhere in the Americas became infected with the virus and began spreading it to people in that area. From 2006 to 2010, 106 laboratory-confirmed or probable cases of chikungunya were detected among travelers returning to the United States. This compares with only three cases reported from 1995 to 2005. Since 2004, chikungunya virus has caused massive and sustained outbreaks in Asia and Africa, infecting more than 2 million people, with attack rates as high as 68 % in some areas. With the movement of travelers, local transmission has taken place in areas where the virus was not previously found, including northern Italy and southern France. Nine cases have been reported in the French territories of the Americas since 2006 (three each in Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Guaina). To date, none of the cases has led to local transmission; however, they demonstrate the ongoing risk of introduction and possible sustained transmission of chikungunya virus in the Americas, experts say. The name chikungunya means "that which bends up. " The disease is rarely fatal, but the severe joint pain it produces can last for months. There is no specific treatment or commercially available vaccine against the disease. Chikungunya virus is spread through the bite of infected mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (the "Asian Tiger Mosquito"). Aedes aegypti, which can also transmit dengue and yellow fever, is common in tropical and subtropical areas of the Americas, including the southern United States. Aedes albopictus is found in more temperate areas of the Americas and is widespread in the southeastern states and East Coast of the United States.

5000|$|China {{emerged as}} the world's third largest {{producer}} of ethanol-based bio-fuels (after the U.S and Brazil) {{at the end of}} the 10th Five Year Plan Period in 2005 and at present ethanol accounts for 20% of total automotive fuel consumption in China. In the 11th Five Year Plan period (2006 through 2010) China planned to develop six megatons/year of fuel ethanol capacity, which is expected to grow to 15 megatons/year by 2020. Despite this level of production, <b>experts</b> <b>say</b> that <b>there</b> will be no threat to food security, though there will be an increasing number of farmers who will be [...] "farming oil" [...] if the price of crude oil continues to increase. Based on planned ethanol projects in some provinces in China, the output of corn would be insufficient to provide the raw material for plants in these provinces. In the recently published World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund expressed concern that there would be increasing competition worldwide between bio-fuels and food consumption for agricultural products and that that competition would likely continue to result in increases in the price of crops.|$|R
