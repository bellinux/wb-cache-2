40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental investigation of tip clearance flow in a radial inflow turbine. Flow visualisation and static pressure measurements were performed. These were combined with hot-wire traverses into the tip gap. The experimental data {{indicates that the}} tip clearance flow in a radial turbine {{can be divided into}} three regions. The first region is located at the rotor inlet, where the influence of relative casing motion dominates the flow over the tip. The second region is located towards midchord, where the effect of relative casing motion is weakened. Finally a third region exists in the <b>exducer,</b> where the effect of relative casing motion becomes small and the leakage flow resembles the tip flow behaviour in an axial turbine. Integration of the velocity profiles showed that there is little tip leakage {{in the first part of}} the rotor because of the effect of scraping. It was found that the bulk of tip leakage flow in a radial turbine passes through the <b>exducer.</b> The mass flow rate, measured at four chordwise positions, was compared with a standard axial turbine tip leakage model. The result revealed the need for a model suited to radial turbines. The hot-wire measurements also indicated a higher tip gap loss in the <b>exducer</b> of the radial turbine. This explains why the stage efficiency of a radial inflow turbine is more affected by increasing the radial clearance than by increasing the axial clearance.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{investigation of the}} effect of different back sweep angles and <b>exducer</b> widths on the steady-state impeller outlet flow pattern of a centrifugal compressor with a vaneless diffuser. The investigations have been performed with commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and in-house programmed one-dimensional (ID) codes. CFD calculations aim to investigate how flow pattern from the impeller is quantitatively influenced by compressor geometry parameters; thereby, the location of wake and its magnitude (flow angle and relative velocity magnitude) are analyzed. Results show that the increased back sweep impeller provides a more uniform flow pattern in terms of velocity and flow deviation angle distribution, and offers better potential for the diffusion process inside a vaneless (or vaned) diffuser Secondary flux fraction and flow deviation angle from CFD simulation are implemented into the ID two-zone program to improve ID prediction results...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} twddecades {{there has been}} a {{progressive}} increase in the scope of small gas turbine development and application, both in commercial and military fields. Technological advances in the military field have created demands for prime movers able to meet more stringent operational requirements. An environment now exists in the U. S. Armed Forces conducive to the acceptance and use of small gas turbines that can be adapted to the many specialized applications demanding distinctive physical characteristics. In 1957, the U. S. Bureau of Naval Weapons entered into a contract with Solar, a Division of International Harvester Company, for the design and development of a small, lightweight, single-shaft gas turbine engine to power a one-man helicopter. Rated at 55 s. h. p. for 100 °F ambient conditions, the engine design requirements were based on simplicity of operation and maintenance, low production cost, and a short development time. These factors were considered more important than optimum specific power, fuel consumption and weight. A two-shaft version of this engine was also required to power a one-man flying platform. To facilitate the required low engine airflow, weight and rugged characteristics, a single-stage centrifugal compressor and radial inflow turbine, mounted back to back, were selected. A unique feature of the two-shaft engine was the simple method of achieving two-shaft capability by using the <b>exducer</b> portion of the radial turbine as a power turbine. This design resulted in both engines having the same nominal performance, weight and envelope dimensions, wit...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the past}} few years, the {{increasing}} market penetration of downsized engines has reduced the pollutant emissions of internal combustion engines. The addition of a turbocharger to the air path has usually enabled the dynamic performances of the vehicles to be maintained. However, in the development process, deciding on the appropriate set of components is not straightforward and a lengthy fitting process is usually required {{to find the right}} turbocharger. Car manufacturers usually have access to a limited library of compressors and turbines which have actually been built and for which measurement campaigns have been carried out. This study is motivated by the need to extend the libraries available for simulation in order to provide a substantial increase in freedom in the matching process. In this paper, we present three different methods to predict the two compressor data-maps that are usually needed in simulations: mass flow rate and isentropic efficiency versus pressure ratio and rotational speed. With the first two methods, extended data-maps are obtained using only the inducer and <b>exducer</b> diameters, the Trim and the A/R ratio of the compressor, i. e. only geometrical characteristics. However, their accuracy remains limited to the database that is used to train the model. The third method consists in predicting the influence of a geometry change on the compressor data-maps. It is considerably more accurate than the first two methods. The paper will present results obtained for more than thirty compressors which have been used to calibrate and validate the tools...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research has been to analyze the steady state performance of a new centrifugal compressor research facility. The CSTAR (Centrifugal STage for Aerodynamic Research) compressor {{has been designed to}} be placed as the last stage in an axial compressor and its performance in this flow regime was measured. ^ Because the compressor was designed as a research vehicle, unique instrumentation throughout the flow path provides a detailed look at its steady state performance. Rakes at the inlet and deswirl section quantify the overall performance but other instrumentation is used to understand the component performance. Static pressure taps along the shroud, within the diffuser, and through the turn-to-axial show the static pressure rise. Additionally, rakes at the inlet and exit of diffuser also characterize the performance of the wedge diffuser and the impeller. ^ Additionally, capacitance probes located at the knee and <b>exducer</b> of the impeller non-intrusively measure the size of the tip clearance during facility operation. An investigation into these measurements resulted in a standard procedure for in-situ calibration and installation to produce repeatable and accurate clearance measurements. Finally, the feasibility of future Laser Doppler Velocimetry measurements acquired through the shroud window was tested and was found to be achievable with the use of beam translators to ensure that measurement volumes are created after beam refraction through the windows. ^ Inlet conditions of the facility have been investigated and fluctuations of the ambient conditions have been mitigated with a large settling chamber to ensure repeatable and stable operation. The current instrumentation was utilized to determine the compressor performance. Measurements of the steady performance parameters along with those of the internal flowfield are documented. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to compare the effects of two different diffuser vane geometries on the performance of a centrifugal compressor. Vaned diffusers are commonly used in aeroengines because they can achieve higher pressure recoveries than vaneless diffusers of similar size. Improving the diffuser’s pressure recovery and effectiveness can result in overall compressor performance benefits that are sought out by engine manufacturers looking to improve overall engine efficiency. An airfoil vane was tested and compared to a baseline wedge diffuser in the Purdue CSTAR research facility, where the centrifugal compressor used for this study is intended to be the last stage of an axial-centrifugal compressor. ^ The overall stage performance for the compressor with the airfoil diffuser was first obtained at open impeller tip clearances and then at tight clearances. In the tight clearance configuration, the compressor consistently had higher total pressure ratio and higher isentropic efficiency compared to the open clearance configuration. In particular, impeller isentropic efficiency and shroud static pressure along the entire impeller passage were highest at the tight impeller clearance configuration, indicating less losses due to tip leakage flow. The reduction in tip leakage flow, and resulting blockage, at tight clearance operation was also suggested by the increase in choke mass flow rate for all corrected speeds. ^ For the comparison of the airfoil and wedge diffuser assemblies, data were acquired with the impeller in the tight clearance configuration. Despite slight differences in <b>exducer</b> tip clearances (less than 2 x 10 - 3 in.), stage total pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency at 100 % corrected speed were not significantly different between the two diffuser assemblies. Upon closer inspection of individual components, the airfoil diffuser actually had, on average, higher pressure recovery and higher diffuser effectiveness than the wedge diffuser. However, the airfoil diffuser assembly had higher losses in the deswirl region compared to the wedge diffuser assembly. Excluding measurements from the deswirl, the total pressure ratio for the airfoil diffuser assembly was slightly greater than that of the wedge diffuser assembly. A physical mismatch in the airfoil diffuser and deswirl assembly could be responsible for the losses recorded in the deswirl region and could have resulted in the limited performance improvements observed. Additionally, the similar vane geometries at the leading edge (in terms of inlet metal angle and thickness) combined with any deviation from design during manufacturing could have limited the predicted performance benefits. ...|$|E
40|$|Micro {{turbines}} are touted {{to become}} the prime system for the combined heat and power(CHP) applications {{in light of their}} significant advantages in terms of performance, size, costs and reduced CO 2 emissions [1]. Micro Turbine Technology B. V. (MTT) is currently developing a 3 KW recuperated micro turbine for such applications. Commercially available off the shelf turbocharger components are used since they provide high performance with relatively low costs since they are mass produced. The drawback in using these components is that they are manufactured for the automotive sector and inherently operate at different conditions than the MTT operating point. Here in lies an interesting scope for performance improvement by optimizing the turbine and within the current work the focus is on aerodynamic optimization of the radial inflow turbine used in the MTT system. This study is a follow-up from the recommendations provided in [2] and [3]. A goal driven optimization is performed on the rotor geometry using ANSYS DesignXplorer and a total of four design solutions were obtained. The most important findings from the response surfaces, sensitivity analysis from the optimization were: 9 ̆ 5 From the parametric sensitivity it was clear that all of the six design variables {{have a significant impact on}} efficiency. The <b>exducer</b> angles have the most predominant effect on efficiency with that of shroud larger than hub. 9 ̆ 5 All of the optimal candidates exhibited an increase in the total-to-total efficiency ranging from a minimum of 6. 38 percentage points to a maximum of 7. 90 percentage points as compared to the baseline geometry. This efficiency improvement was accompanied by an increase in mass flow rate with a minimum value of 69. 15 g/s and a maximum of 73. 51 g/s. These design solutions are then coupled with the diffuser domain to study the performance characteristics and the interaction between the components. The most important outcomes from these simulations were: The efficiency of the rotor drops by 3 percentage points on an average due to the additional pressure losses introduced when coupled with the diffuser. 9 ̆ 5 The diffuser performance has improved and the Cp experiences a maximum increase of 17. 63 percentage points (Candidate D) and a minimum of 12. 70 percentage points (Candidate B). The swirl coefficient for optimum diffuser performance is found at values close to 0. 22. If the swirl coefficient is increased or decreased from this optimum, diffuser performance drops. The best design solution in terms of rotor efficiency and overall total-to-static efficiency is Candidate C. However it exhibits a poorer diffuser performance than the other optimal candidates. From this study, it is apparent that there is compromise between rotor and diffuser performance. 9 ̆ 5 The improvement in rotor efficiency(<tt, 5 ax) ranges from a minimum of 6. 16 (Candidate A) percentage points to a maximum of 8. 54 percentage points (Candidate C) as compared to the baseline which is more or less similar to the case with the individual rotor domain simulations. The improvement in total-to-static efficiency (<ts, 9) achieves only a maximum of 3. 23 percentage points(Candidate C) as compared to the baseline. In other words,whatever is gained in rotor total-to-total efficiency from the design optimization, less than half of it is utilized when coupled with the diffuser(Cp< 50...|$|E
