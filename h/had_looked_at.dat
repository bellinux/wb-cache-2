5|$|Darling had {{a strong}} {{personality}} and an independent outlook. Those who knew him well thought him destined {{to be a leader}} in whatever he undertook. He shunned strong drink and tobacco and found it difficult to tolerate overindulgence in alcohol. Normally even-tempered, he did show displeasure at the heckling from the crowd at Lord's at his obstinate defensive effort {{in the face of an}} Australian batting collapse. He was a stickler for fair play, but his actions against the English batsman KS Ranjitsinhji would today be seen as gamesmanship. During the bowler's approach and after the bowler <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the field, the Australian fielders moved behind Ranjitsinhji's back. This worried the Indian prince when playing his leg glance and eventually saw him left out of the English team.|$|E
5|$|Pressured by the United Nations, which <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the {{situation}} in the former East Indies with disdain, on 29August 1947 the Dutch established the Van Mook Line, which divided Dutch and Indonesian-controlled areas. Along this line a ceasefire was called. Sudirman recalled the Indonesian guerrillas hiding in Dutch-held lands, ordering them to return to Indonesian-held areas. To keep their spirits up, he referred to the withdrawal as a hijrah, reminiscent of Muhammad's migration to Medina in 622AD, implying that they would return. Over 35,000troops left western Java at this order, travelling to Yogyakarta by train and ship. This boundary was formalised by the Renville Agreement on 17January 1948; among the signatories was Amir Sjarifuddin, by then also serving as prime minister. Meanwhile, Sjarifuddin began rationalising the army, cutting back on the number of troops. At the time the regular army consisted of 350,000men, with a further 470,000in the laskar.|$|E
25|$|After La Gioconda, Callas had {{no further}} offers, and when Serafin, {{looking for someone}} to sing Isolde, called on her, she told him that she already knew the score, even though she <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> only the first act out of curiosity while at the conservatory. She sight-read the opera's second act for Serafin, who praised her for knowing the role so well, whereupon she {{admitted}} to having bluffed and having sight-read the music. Even more impressed, Serafin immediately cast her in the role. Serafin thereafter served as Callas's mentor and supporter.|$|E

25|$|Meri's travel book of {{his journey}} to the {{northeast}} passage, Virmaliste Väraval (At the Gate of the Northern Lights) (1974), won him huge success in the Soviet Union. It was translated into Finnish in 1977 in the Soviet Writers series, which also introduced to Finnish readers works by the Estonian writers Mats Traat, Lilli Promet, and Ülo Tuulik. In the book Meri combined the present with a perspective into history, and used material from such explorers as Cook, Forster, Wrangel, Dahl, Sauer, Middendorff, Cochran, and others. When he sees a mountain rising against the stormy sky of the Bering Strait, he realizes that Vitus Bering and James Cook <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the same mountain, but {{from the other side}} of the strait.|$|E
25|$|Progestogens, in {{conjunction}} with the hormone prolactin, are involved in the maturation of the lobules, acini, and areola during pregnancy: mammary structures that estrogen has little to no direct effect on. However, there is no clinical evidence that progestogens enhance breast size, shape, or appearance in either transgender women or cisgender women, and one study found no benefit to breast hemicircumference over estrogen alone in a small sample of transgender women given both an estrogen and an oral progestogen (usually 10mg/day medroxyprogesterone acetate). However, the authors of the paper stated that the sample size was too small to make any definitive conclusions, and that further studies should be carried out to confirm whether progestogens significantly affect breast size and/or shape in transgender women. As of 2014, no additional study <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the issue. Anecdotal evidence from transgender women suggests that those who take progesterone supplements may experience more full breast development, including stage IV on the Tanner scale (many transgender women do not develop Tanner stage V breasts). However, there have been no formal studies with sufficiently large sample sizes to confirm this.|$|E
25|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} 17 May 2004 and lasted six weeks. Arctor's house was located on Eric Circle in Southeast Austin. The previous tenants {{had left a}} month prior to filming and left the place {{in such a state}} that production designer Bruce Curtis had to make few modifications so that it looked like a run-down home. The filmmakers <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> 60 houses before settling on this one. Linklater shot a lot of exteriors in Anaheim, California and then composited them into the Austin footage in post-production. Since the live action footage was to be animated over later, makeup, lighting and visible equipment, like boom mics, were less of a concern. However, cinematographer Shane Kelly carefully composed shots and used a color palette with the animators in mind. Sometimes, they would show up to tell Kelly what they needed. Because the movie was being shot digitally and then animated, occasionally actors forgot they would later be animated as they worked through a scene. Robert Downey, Jr. noted that he completely forgot the scene would later be animated as he worked through several takes in order to produce the smoke ring that would be featured in Barris' first closeup shot.|$|E

500|$|Well {{into the}} 20th century, many {{physicians}} <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> obstetrics as an unnecessary medical specialty. As a result, medical schools did not cover childbirth in much detail, and medical students might graduate without having even witnessed {{the delivery of}} a baby. Distressed by this lack of attention, DeLee made teaching and mentoring important parts of his career. With a maternal mortality rate about one-quarter of the national average, DeLee's Chicago Lying-In Hospital became well-respected and influential, and medical students would travel {{across the country to}} gain some experience there. A young woman named Beatrice Tucker came to Lying-In to complete her residency in 1929. Three years later, DeLee named Tucker director of the Chicago Maternity Center, where she worked for more than forty years and delivered an estimated 100,000 babies.|$|E
500|$|MITS was now $300,000 in {{debt and}} Roberts {{was looking for a}} new hit product. He decided to return to the kit market with a low cost computer. The target {{customer}} would think that [...] "some assembly required" [...] was a desirable feature. Roberts <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the Intel 4004 for calculators and thought the Intel 8008 was limited and difficult to work with. Intel had just released the 8080, their first microprocessor that could be a general purpose computer. The target price of this complete computer kit had to be under $400. To meet this price, Roberts agreed to order 1000 microprocessors from Intel for $75 each. Roberts and his head engineer, Bill Yates, began designing the computer. The company was down to 20 employees and a bank loan for $60,000 financed the design and initial production of the new computer.|$|E

He also proposed putting [...] "April19" [...] on the coin; Beach did not do so, though he adopted other suggestions from Keyes. The Commission of Fine Arts felt that French's statue, due to its narrowness, was not suitable for a coin. Nevertheless, it approved the design, with Moore writing to Mint Director Robert J. Grant on March5 that [...] "a designer should be permitted to use symbols as he best knows how to use them in filling the spaces of a coin or medal." ...|$|E

When she told her [...] "leader" [...] that she <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> websites run by anti-Scientology protesters (and disagreed with them), he reportedly replied [...] "That's like saying I don't burn niggers, I just like to party with the KKK!" [...] In Fall 2008 Mullen left the church, joining a group of Chanology protesters across the street. Church of Scientology Manhattan President John Carmichael issued a response the following week, stating [...] "Mandy Mullen's story about Scientology... is all lies {{in the service of}} Anonymous, a hate group that targets our Church, or even anyone who just falls onto their radar." [...] On November 13, 2009, Independent Australian Senator Nick Xenophon used parliamentary privilege to accuse the Church of Scientology of being a criminal organisation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{case had}} entered the {{confirmation}} process because Kagan was a law clerk to Justice Marshall when the appeal first arrived at the Court and wrote a memo to Marshall cautioning against taking the case (a) without a signal of wider support on the Court (the [...] "Join 3" [...] response: an agreement conditioned on another three justices first agreeing; Kagan called it the [...] "Join 4" [...] and was corrected by the Justice) and (b) because the Court was likely to rule, as it ultimately did, against {{the extension of the}} due process protection to find for the plaintiff in the case. Two Republican Senators, Jon Kyl of Arizona and Jeff Sessions of Alabama, <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> other of Kagan's memos from her clerkship and found that they showed she [...] "was highly opinionated and wanted to use the law to achieve specific policy results, rather than deciding legal questions on their merits."

2500|$|August Friedrich Kellner (February 1, 1885 [...] November 4, 1970) was a mid-level {{official}} in Germany {{who worked as}} a justice inspector in Mainz and Laubach.

[...] After the war he became a political organizer for the [...] Social Democratic Party of Germany, [...] which was the leading political party {{during the time of the}} turbulent and short-lived Weimar Republic, Germany’s first period of democracy. [...] Kellner campaigned against Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. [...] During World War II, working as a civil servant at a small court house, he wrote a diary to record his observations of the Nazi regime. [...] Based on conversations and attentive reading of newspapers, he described the various crimes of that regime. He titled his work Mein Widerstand, meaning [...] "My Opposition".
