500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>village</b> {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E

2500|$|The {{islands of}} Zanzibar {{have a large}} number of butterflies. Pete village, has the Zanzibar Butterfly Centre (ZBC), which was {{established}} in 2008. At this centre, local butter fly species are farmed for which training on the knowledge of their botanical and natural habitats are provided to {{a large number of}} farmers. This enables farmers to have additional avenues for income generation. The farmers have also established a [...] "Farmers Council" [...] to interact and disseminate the knowledge acquired, to other farmers. The farming involves creating a small netted enclosure with food plants placed in it to attract butterflies. Out of the butterflies caught in the netted enclosure, the female species are segregated into another breeding cage where they lay eggs, which are then kept in a pest free box to hatch caterpillars or larva. The hatching process takes about two weeks. Following the hatching, they are allowed to pupate on the underside of selected leaves, which again takes about two weeks. The pupae are then sold by the farmers, after retaining some stock for further regeneration in the cages. This project has been assisted by the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund. The ZBC works in close association with Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park, Jozani Environmental Conservation Association (JECA) and Pete Development Association (PDA). The butterfly known as the [...] "flying handkerchief" [...] can be seen <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>village.</b> However, bigger and larger butterflies are seen in the wild.|$|E
