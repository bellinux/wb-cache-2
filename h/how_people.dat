There should, however, be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave, and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.|$|E

5|$|After {{initializing}} {{the concept}} in January 2013, the two discussed {{the project for}} three or four months before creating an outline for the whole story. The original outline was for 12 issues, but it left room for improvisation and a few points were removed as the story progressed. They looked at past and present social movements for civil rights for inspiration for how one would progress and <b>how</b> <b>people</b> might respond to a movement for android rights. Luna wrote the first draft of issue one, then the two worked together to rewrite it.|$|E
5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory {{on the belief that}} reason should be used to determine <b>how</b> <b>people</b> ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave.|$|E
5|$|Because {{norms for}} {{language}} use {{are shared by}} members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status {{as a second language}} speaker. These kinds of differences {{are not part of the}} linguistic system, but are an important part of <b>how</b> <b>people</b> use language as a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E

5|$|Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which players take {{the role of an}} unnamed man who explores the post-apocalyptic remains of Tokyo. Like its predecessor Megami Tensei II has players navigate dungeon environments in first-person, but between dungeons they also navigate an overworld from an overhead perspective. During their journey, the protagonist's party can visit shops and towns to gain additional story information and to purchase items using in-game currency. As they progress through the story, the protagonist is presented with morality-based dialogue options which influence <b>how</b> <b>people</b> respond to him and ultimately determine which ending is received.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, {{the vampire}} is {{generally}} {{held to be}} a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of decomposition after death and <b>how</b> <b>people</b> in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this, creating {{the figure of the}} vampire to explain the mysteries of death. Porphyria was also linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Johnson (18 September 1709 13 December 1784) was an English author born in Lichfield, Staffordshire. He was {{a sickly}} infant who early on began to exhibit the tics that would {{influence}} <b>how</b> <b>people</b> viewed {{him in his}} later years. From childhood he displayed great intelligence and an eagerness for learning, but his early years were dominated by his family's financial strain and his efforts to establish himself as a school teacher.|$|E

5|$|The end of The Dry Salvages {{starts with}} a {{discussion}} about <b>how</b> <b>people</b> attempt to see the future through various superstitious means.

By acting properly, one would be able to overcome life and move towards the next world.|$|E
5|$|The series' concept {{originated}} in 1999 when Taniguchi {{was working on}} Infinite Ryvius. He wanted to create another series that would contain themes similar to it, {{as well as new}} ones centered mostly on <b>how</b> <b>people</b> adapted to the 21st century. A manga adaptation of s-CRY-ed, drawn by Yasunari Toda, was serialized in Akita Shoten's Weekly Shōnen Champion. A novelization by Kazuho Hyodo has been published. Additionally, a two-part recollection film was released by Sunrise. Both the anime and the manga have also seen English release.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the abnormal; the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work, but the two have developed a deep friendship. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a series of murders of psychics and fortune tellers. The two are assisted by Clyde Bruckman (Peter Boyle), an enigmatic and reluctant individual who possesses the ability to foresee <b>how</b> <b>people</b> are going to die.|$|E

5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in working memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate <b>how</b> <b>people</b> were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies.|$|E
5|$|According to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, {{the themes}} of {{alienation}} and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading the Kafka work while focusing on the futility of his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out <b>how</b> <b>people</b> tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer Milan Kundera suggests that Kafka's surrealist humour {{may have been an}} inversion of Dostoyevsky's presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka's work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.|$|E
