50|$|<b>Edogestrone</b> (INN, BAN) (developmental {{code name}} PH-218), or edogesterone, {{also known as}} 17α-acetoxy-3,3-ethylenedioxy-6-methylpregn-5-en-20-one, is a steroidal {{progestin}} and antiandrogen of the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone group that was synthesized in 1964 but was never marketed. Similarly to the structurally related steroid cyproterone acetate, <b>edogestrone</b> binds directly to the androgen receptor and antagonizes it, displacing androgens like testosterone from the receptor, though not as potently as cyproterone acetate. The drug has also been found to suppress androgen production, likely via progesterone receptor activation-mediated antigonadotropic activity.|$|E
