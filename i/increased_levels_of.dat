5|$|Bears are {{generally}} bulky and robust animals with short tails. They are sexually dimorphic {{with regard to}} size, with males typically being larger. Larger species tend to show <b>increased</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species. Relying as they do on strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk. The shoulder blades and the pelvis are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter {{than those of the}} big cats as {{there is no need for}} them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, to dig out burrowing animals, to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and to club large creatures.|$|E
5|$|Given an {{adequate}} supply of food, larvae pupate and weave silken cocoons after three larval stages. Within the cocoon, the larva moults {{for a final}} time and undergoes metamorphosis into the adult form. This can take just four days, but may take much longer under adverse conditions, and there follows a variable-length stage during which the pre-emergent adult awaits a suitable opportunity to emerge. Trigger factors for emergence include vibrations (including sound), heat (in warm-blooded hosts), and <b>increased</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> carbon dioxide, all of which stimuli may indicate {{the presence of a}} suitable host. Large numbers of pre-emergent fleas may be present in otherwise flea-free environments, and the introduction of a suitable host may trigger a mass emergence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} and years after the typhoon, natives in Ulithi were {{examined}} for <b>increased</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> stress.

There was some talk among residents of leaving Ulithi and moving to nearby islands such as Yap, Palau, Saipan, or even the Philippines; however, mentions of this diminished relatively quickly. The devastation to the island's infrastructure hastened a previously gradual change in buildings. Reconstruction efforts had entirely abandoned traditional Ulithi building styles in favor of more modern ones. The survival of concrete buildings prompted an overall desire among people to construct all buildings with concrete. Alongside the infrastructural overhaul, a shift in dietary changes to a more western style occurred.|$|E

5|$|Lili {{continued}} generally southward, {{reaching its}} peak intensity of 80mph (130km/h). Higher pressures developed to its northeast, {{resulting in the}} hurricane to accelerate to the southwest. On December 22, Lili finished executing its large cyclonic loop by passing over the same location it passed one week prior. The combination of its increased forward speed, as well as <b>increased</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> vertical wind shear, created an unfavorable environment which caused steady weakening. On December 23, Lili weakened to a tropical storm while located 430miles (690km) northeast of Antigua. It rapidly lost organization as it approached the Leeward Islands, and dissipated just {{off the coast of}} the Dominican Republic on December 24.|$|E
5|$|Most Proteaceae and all Banksia species, {{including}} B.aemula, have proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters of}} short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. A study of six wallum species, including B.aemula, found they have adapted to very low levels of phosphorus and are highly sensitive to <b>increased</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the element, leading to phosphorus toxicity. Some evidence suggests they are efficient at using potassium, and sensitive to calcium toxicity as well. A field study on North Stradbroke Island noted increased root growth in autumn (around April), but that overall root growth was more constant than other species looked at, possibly because its deeper roots had more regular access to groundwater.|$|E
5|$|The {{biochemical}} {{basis for}} the toxicity of oxygen is the partial reduction of oxygen by one or two electrons to form reactive oxygen species, which are natural by-products of the normal metabolism of oxygen and have important roles in cell signalling. One species produced by the body, the superoxide anion (−), is possibly involved in iron acquisition. Higher than normal concentrations of oxygen lead to <b>increased</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> reactive oxygen species. Oxygen is necessary for cell metabolism, and the blood supplies it to {{all parts of the}} body. When oxygen is breathed at high partial pressures, a hyperoxic condition will rapidly spread, with the most vascularised tissues being most vulnerable. During times of environmental stress, levels of reactive oxygen species can increase dramatically, which can damage cell structures and produce oxidative stress.|$|E

5|$|Throughout history, the Earth's {{atmosphere}} and biogeochemical cycles {{have been in}} a dynamic equilibrium with planetary ecosystems. The history is characterized by periods of significant transformation followed by millions of years of stability. The evolution of the earliest organisms, likely anaerobic methanogen microbes, started the process by converting atmospheric hydrogen into methane (4H2 + CO2 → CH4 + 2H2O). Anoxygenic photosynthesis reduced hydrogen concentrations and increased atmospheric methane, by converting hydrogen sulfide into water or other sulfur compounds (for example, 2H2S + CO2 + hv → CH2O + H2O + 2S). Early forms of fermentation also <b>increased</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> atmospheric methane. The transition to an oxygen-dominant atmosphere (the Great Oxidation) did not begin until approximately 2.4–2.3billion years ago, but photosynthetic processes started 0.3 to 1billion years prior.|$|E
5|$|Following the takeover, a new {{stationmaster}}'s {{house was}} built at Sea Mills, {{at a cost of}} £240. The stationmaster is recorded as having kept a variety of farm animals and sold eggs to passengers. <b>Increased</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> traffic saw the line through Sea Mills doubled in the early 1900s, and the opportunity was taken to rebuild the station. A second platform opened on 6 January 1907 {{to the west of the}} tracks to serve northbound trains. The original platform now exclusively served southbound trains, and was lengthened to , the same length as the new platform. A station building was constructed on the original platform in a domestic style, with an arched terracotta entrance, spar-covered walls and a high-pitched tiled roof. The building contained a booking hall, booking office, toilets and a ladies' waiting room. A smaller building on the northbound platform contained a general waiting room. The subway under the bridge over the River Trym was also built at this time, with the porter's job being expanded to include washing the rubbish out of the subway after high tide, for which the railway provided a hosepipe and Wellington boots. By 1910 there were 17 trains from Bristol to Avonmouth and 15 back, increasing to 21 and 19 respectively by 1920, though not all stopped at Sea Mills. The station was completely closed on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|Four storms struck Madagascar in {{the season}} between December and March, collectively killing 100people and causing $250million (1982 United States dollars) in damage. The storms caused {{widespread}} flooding and a state of disaster for four months, compounded by floods in January. About 180,000people were forced to evacuate, and there were <b>increased</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> flood-related diseases. The storms closed down many roads and destroyed widespread crops, forcing the government to import 400,000 metric tons of rice. After the floods, workers repaired damaged roads and dykes while the government provided relief supplies. However, the ongoing floods strained the Madagascar's resources, and the government appealed for aid {{to the international community}} on February4. The United States Agency for International Development provided nearly $9million in aid, mostly for rice and rebuilding roads. Other countries donated about $7.5million in money or relief goods, such as building materials, food, clothing, and medicine.|$|E
