On February 24, Gerimena briefly level off in intensity while turning back to south. Furthermore, the JTWC stopped <b>keeping</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> on Gerimena at 0000 UTC on February 26 as the storm re-curved east.

Marshall replied that as much as the Army would like to have Middleton back in uniform, all the Army could do would be to place him in some training role, which would not effectively use his battle experience.|$|E
5|$|To {{their right}} is the king's nephew, prince Józef Poniatowski (34), in {{the uniform of}} the light cavalry of the Duchy of Warsaw and riding a grey horse. The uniform is another {{instance}} of foreshadowing; Poniatowski became the commander-in-chief of the Duchy's army and died during the Battle of Leipzig. At {{the time of the}} passing of the Constitution, he was the commander of the Warsaw garrison, and is shown <b>keeping</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> on the procession, with his soldiers lined up and guarding the street.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1975 season, Pryce's future was subject to much speculation. Rumour linked him with a drive at Lotus, the team run by Colin Chapman, who had been <b>keeping</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> on Pryce's {{progress}} throughout 1973 and 1974. At the time, Lotus was experiencing financial difficulties and reports suggested that Shadow and Lotus would swap Pryce and Swede Ronnie Peterson. The trade was viewed as a good acquisition for both teams, as Pryce was considered a driver of the same ability as Peterson, but would cost Lotus less, while Peterson could attract sponsorship to the relatively new Shadow team. The deal never materialised, although Shadow team manager Alan Rees claims that it came very close to being completed.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Typhoon Dinah {{can be traced}} back to a poorly {{organized}} area of disturbed weather that formed on August18 close to Guam and was embedded in the monsoon trough, at the time situated near the equator. At 06:00UTC on August19, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system, as the system started to show signs of organization. Shortly thereafter, a low pressure area developed along the axis of the system, prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) to start <b>keeping</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> on the low. Late on August20, there was a rapid increase in the coverage of the thunderstorm activity, and satellite intensity estimates via the Dvorak Technique reached T2.0/. Based on this, the JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression at 00:00UTC on August21.|$|E

25|$|Conflicts {{have arisen}} in the United States on federally-designated beaches, which are {{nevertheless}} patrolled by local police, {{since there is}} no federal law against nudity in these areas, but there may well be local ones.

25|$|As Robert E. Lee {{moved his}} Army of Northern Virginia northward in June 1863 through the Shenandoah Valley towards Pennsylvania, {{portions}} of his cavalry under J.E.B.

However, Stuart was not in position to effectively screen Lee's advance or to provide intelligence on the movements of the Federal army.

25|$|The story {{centers around}} three seamen who conduct shady {{business}} on board their vessel, Sandy Hook.

The third seaman, Lars (Sverre Anker Ousdal), presents plans to freight a bulldozer to the mainland from Sarstangen. They have been instructed to dump the bulldozer underway as part of an insurance fraud scheme, but have instead made arrangements to sell the vehicle on Greenland. While at port, Tom is called to visit Governor Bache (Jon Eikemo), who warns that he will be <b>keeping</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> on them.|$|E

The dog is vigilant and will rest in the daytime, <b>keeping</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye</b> on the surroundings, but at night is constantly moving, patrolling the place, moving up and down around the whole area.
