This advance was mounted to <b>divert</b> <b>attention</b> <b>from</b> Lae, {{which was one}} of the main objectives of Operation Cartwheel, and proceeded slowly. In late June the 3rd Division was reinforced by the US 162nd Regimental Combat Team which staged an amphibious landing to the south of Salamaua. The town was eventually captured on 11 September 1943.|$|E

In July 2005, Fonda announced plans to make an anti-war bus tour in March 2006 with her daughter and several families of military veterans, saying that some war veterans she had met while on her book tour had urged her to speak out against the Iraq War. She later canceled the tour due to concerns that she would <b>divert</b> <b>attention</b> <b>from</b> Cindy Sheehan's activism.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from the League of Nations, Poland agreed to negotiate, hoping to buy time and <b>divert</b> <b>attention</b> <b>from</b> the upcoming Żeligowski's Mutiny. The Lithuanians sought to achieve as much protection for Vilnius as possible. The agreement resulted in a ceasefire and established a demarcation line running through the disputed Suwałki Region up to the Bastuny railway station. The line was incomplete and did not provide adequate protection to Vilnius. Although neither Vilnius or the surrounding region was explicitly addressed in the agreement, numerous historians have described the agreement as allotting Vilnius to Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and <b>divert</b> <b>attention</b> <b>from</b> himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, to <b>divert</b> <b>attention</b> <b>from</b> {{economic}} difficulties in Iran and from a growing nationalist movement, a campaign of persecution against the Bahá'ís was instituted. An approved and coordinated anti-Bahá'í campaign (to incite public passion against the Bahá'ís) started in 1955 and it included the spreading of anti-Bahá'í propaganda on national radio stations and in official newspapers. In the late 1970s the Shah's regime consistently lost legitimacy due to criticism that it was pro-Western. As the anti-Shah movement gained ground and support, revolutionary propaganda was spread which alleged {{that some of the}} Shah's advisors were Bahá'ís. Bahá'ís were portrayed as economic threats, and as supporters of Israel and the West, and societal hostility against the Bahá'ís increased.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January, the Japanese {{military}} {{changed their}} radio communication codes, {{making it more}} difficult for Allied intelligence, which had heretofore partially broken Japanese radio ciphers, to divine Japanese intentions and movement. As January progressed, Allied reconnaissance and radio traffic analysis noted the buildup of ships and aircraft at Truk, Rabaul, and the Shortland Islands. Allied analysts determined that the increased radio traffic in the Marshalls was a deception meant to <b>divert</b> <b>attention</b> <b>from</b> an operation about to take place in either New Guinea or the Solomons. Allied intelligence personnel, however, misinterpreted the nature of the operation. On 26 January, the Allied Pacific Command's intelligence section informed Allied forces in the Pacific that the Japanese were preparing for a new offensive, called Ke, in either the Solomons or New Guinea.|$|E

5|$|Preparations for the {{offensive}} were, however, far from perfect; on 8 November, Stavka issued orders {{to postpone the}} launch date of the operation, because transportation delays had prevented many units {{from being able to}} move into place. In the meantime, units at the front went through a number of war games to practice repelling an enemy counterattack and exploiting a breakthrough with mechanized forces. These movements were masked through a deception campaign by the Soviets, including the decrease of radio traffic, camouflage, operational security, using couriers for communication instead of radio, and active deception, such as increasing troop movements around Moscow. Troops were ordered to build defensive fortifications, to offer false impressions to the Germans, while fake bridges were put up to <b>divert</b> <b>attention</b> <b>from</b> the real bridges being built across the Don River. The Red Army also stepped up attacks against Army Group Center and set up dummy formations to maintain the idea of a main offensive against German forces in the center.|$|E
5|$|The Union {{military}} command in the West {{suffered from a}} lack of unified command, and were organized into three separate departments: the Department of Kansas, under Maj. Gen. David Hunter; the Department of Missouri, under Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck; and the Department of the Ohio, under Brig. Gen. Don Carlos Buell. By January 1862, the disunity was apparent because they could not agree on a strategy for operations in the Western Theater. Buell, under political pressure to invade and hold pro-Union eastern Tennessee, moved slowly in the direction of Nashville. In Halleck's department, Grant moved up the Tennessee River to <b>divert</b> <b>attention</b> <b>from</b> Buell's intended advance, which did not occur. Halleck and the other generals in the West were coming under political pressure from President Abraham Lincoln to participate in a general offensive by Washington's birthday (February 22). Despite his tradition of caution, Halleck eventually reacted positively to Grant's proposal to move against Fort Henry. Halleck hoped that this would improve his standing in relation to his rival, Buell. Halleck and Grant were also concerned about rumors that Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard would soon arrive with 15 Confederate regiments. On January 30, 1862, Halleck authorized Grant to take Fort Henry.|$|E

40|$|Similar {{effects have}} been {{reported}} for <b>diverting</b> <b>attention</b> <b>from</b> postural control and increased anxiety {{on the characteristics of}} center-of-pressure (COP) time series (decreased excursions and elevated mean power frequency). These effects have also received similar interpretations in terms of increased postural stiffness, suggesting that cognitive and affective manipulations have similar influences on postural control. The present experiment tested this hypothesis by comparing postural conditions involving manipulations of <b>attention</b> (<b>diverting</b> <b>attention</b> <b>from</b> posture using cognitive and motor dual tasks) and anxiety (standing at a height), and by complementing posturography with electromyographic analyses to directly examine neuromuscular stiffness control. Affective and cognitive manipulations had markedly different effects. Unlike the height condition, <b>diverting</b> <b>attention</b> <b>from</b> balance induced smaller COP amplitudes and higher sway frequencies. In addition, more regular COP trajectories (lower sample entropy) were found in the height condition than the dual-task conditions, suggesting elevated attentional investment in posture under the affective manipulation. Finally, based on an analysis of the cross-correlation function between anterior-posterior COP time series and enveloped calf muscle activity, indications of tighter anticipatory neuromuscular control of posture were found for the height condition only. Our data suggest that affective and cognitive perturbations have qualitatively different effects on postural control, and thus are likely to be associated with different control processes, as evidenced by differences in neuromuscular regulation and attentional investment in posture. © 2010 Elsevier B.
