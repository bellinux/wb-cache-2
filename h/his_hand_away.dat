500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Bahraini writer Abbas Busafwan {{argued that the}} Khawalid {{brothers}} are the king's crew and allegations made against them, including Al Bandar report {{are no more than}} the king's own projects. He argued that the early reforms initiated by the king (known as [...] "the reform project") only aim was [...] "re-concentrating power in <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>away</b> from the PM, and not {{for the creation of a}} popular partnership and a democratic life". Busafwan added that Khalid bin Ahmed and Ahmed bin Ateyatalla were responsible for the formation and implementation of what he called the [...] "Hamad strategy". He did not conciser the CP a moderate, instead he said the CP was [...] "unable to form a balance with the powerful Al-Khawaled".|$|E
500|$|According to Abu Rahma, {{six minutes}} of his footage {{focused on the}} al-Durrahs. France2 {{broadcast}} 59seconds of that scene and released another few seconds of it. No part of the footage shows the boy dead. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the end, during which Muhammad appears to lift <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> from his face. Enderlin said he had cut this scene {{in accordance with the}} France2 ethical charter, because it showed the boy in his death throes ("agonie"), which he said was [...] "unbearable" [...] ("J'ai coupé l'agonie de l'enfant. C'était insupportable... Cela n'aurait rien apporté de plus). In 2007 he said he had meant to use the word agony, not agonie. If he were editing the footage again, he said in 2005, he would include that scene.|$|E
2500|$|Underarm bowling was {{effective}} while pitch conditions were difficult for batsmen due to being uneven and uncovered. [...] In time, {{especially after the}} opening of Lord's {{and the development of}} groundsmanship, pitches began to improve and batsmen were able to play longer innings than formerly. [...] In the 1780s and 1790s, one of the best batsmen around was Tom Walker, who was also a very useful slow bowler. [...] Walker was another improviser like Lumpy and he began to experiment by bowling with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> from his body. [...] It is not clear how high he raised his hand {{but it could have been}} waist height. [...] He was accused of [...] "jerking" [...] the ball and so delivering it in an unfair and improper manner. [...] He was suitably censured for his trouble and was forced to return to his normal underarm lobs, but he had sown the seeds of bowling's next revolution.|$|E
5000|$|The slappee is on defense, and {{attempts}} to avoid having <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> slapped, by pulling <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> as the slapper brings <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> over to attempt a slap. However, the slappee cannot flinch too much in attempting to avoid a slap. (On one variation of the game, if the slappee pulls <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> when the slapper has not brought <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> around, then the slappee must submit to a [...] "free slap" [...] by the slapper.) ...|$|R
60|$|She flung <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away.</b> He {{felt her}} eyes burning into his, {{this time with}} {{something}} more like furious curiosity.|$|R
60|$|He hid {{his brow}} {{in his arms}} and groaned aloud. Softly Swanhild crept up to him--softly she drew <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away,</b> holding them between her own.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hooper brought <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> {{from his}} waistcoat-pocket--empty.|$|E
60|$|LORD GORING. [Taking <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> quietly.] Yes: except that.|$|E
60|$|The {{intruder}} moved <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> {{from his}} eyes. His expression {{was full of}} wonder.|$|E
60|$|He put out <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to take her, but {{she turned}} perversely from him, and hid {{her face in}} Annie's neck, pushing <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> with a {{backward}} reach of her little arm.|$|R
6000|$|A cry of pain {{broke from}} the lad's lips, and he leaped to his feet, tearing <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from Lord Henry's grasp. [...] "Dead! Sibyl dead! It is not true! It {{is a horrible}} lie! How dare you say it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You try it," [...] ses Sam, {{sitting up}} in bed very sharp and {{snatching}} <b>his</b> <b>'and</b> <b>away.</b> [...] "Wot d'ye mean coming 'ome at all hours and waking me up?" [...] "Where did you get that ring?" [...] ses Ginger. [...] "Friend o' mine," [...] ses Sam, very short.|$|R
60|$|The Bishop, startled, takes <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away.</b> Mrs George's {{eyes open}} vividly as she {{interrupts}} Soames.|$|E
60|$|She {{shook her}} head violently, and with a sudden effort thrust <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> from her mouth.|$|E
60|$|He gently drew <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> from me, {{and sighed}} {{as he did}} it. Perhaps she had {{sometimes}} kissed his hand.|$|E
60|$|The man scowled {{from one}} to the other, and <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> stole <b>away</b> from <b>his</b> sword.|$|R
60|$|Thorne echoed Mercedes's scream. Gale looked round {{just in time}} to leap {{and catch}} the cavalryman as he staggered, {{apparently}} for the steep slope. And then, as Gale dragged him back, both fell. Gale saved his friend, but he plunged into a choya. He drew <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> full of the great glistening cones of thorns.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whoopee!" [...] yelled the cowboy. Pan {{had heard}} Blinky yell that way before. He clapped <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> over <b>his</b> ears, {{for no more}} mighty pealing human sound than Blinky's famous yell ever rose to the skies. When Pan took <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from <b>his</b> cars he caught the {{clapping}} echoes, ringing, prolonged, back from bluff to slope, winding away, to mellow, to soften, to die in beautiful concatenation far up in the wild breaks of the hills.|$|R
60|$|Rollo did so. He {{had to take}} <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> very quick, for it {{was quite}} hot there. The little tuft {{remained}} quietly upon the hearth where he placed it.|$|E
60|$|SHE [relenting and patting {{his hand}} fondly] Oh, {{you are a}} dear darling boy, Henry; but [throwing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> fretfully] you're no use. I want {{somebody}} {{to tell me what}} to do.|$|E
6000|$|Morton took <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> {{in anger}} and disgust. [...] "All {{this is a}} ruse to weaken our grasp upon her," [...] he thought. [...] "Even the mother, so serene, so candid, is aiding the deception." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no! I {{want to do}} {{them all}} myself," [...] she said, gesturing <b>his</b> offered <b>hands</b> <b>away,</b> with a little nether appeal in her {{laughing}} refusal.|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly {{she bends}} and kisses <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> KEITH draws <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> [...] <b>away,</b> and she recoils a little humbly, {{looking up at}} him again. [...] Suddenly she stands rigid, listening.|$|R
6000|$|... "What are {{you talking}} of? {{what do you mean}} by this?" [...] cried Wicks, {{snatching}} <b>his</b> half-bandaged <b>hand</b> <b>away,</b> so that the blood sprinkled in the surgeon's face.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Guppy {{sitting on}} the window-sill, nodding his head and {{balancing}} all these possibilities in his mind, continues thoughtfully to tap it, and clasp it, and measure it with his hand, until he hastily draws <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
6000|$|This thunder-blast {{was from}} old Jacques d'Arc, and Joan was {{the object of}} it. The {{stranger}} was startled, and took <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away,</b> and there was Joan standing before him offering him her bowl of porridge. The man said: ...|$|E
60|$|Fiorsen {{stretched}} {{out his hand and}} seized hers just where her little warm pulse was beating very steadily. She looked at it, changed her fork over, and went on eating with the other hand. Fiorsen drew <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> {{as if he had been}} stung.|$|E
25|$|An {{autopilot}} is a mechanical, electrical, or {{hydraulic system}} used to guide a vehicle without assistance {{from a human}} being. Most people understand an autopilot to refer specifically to aircraft, but self-steering gear for ships, boats, space craft, and missiles is sometimes also called autopilot. The first aircraft autopilot was invented by Lawrence Sperry in 1912. Sperry demonstrated it in 1914, and proved {{the credibility of the}} invention by flying the aircraft with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from the controls and visible to onlookers.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{finding that}} he could not escape, Sir Gawaine leaped down from his horse's back, and flinging himself upon the ground he covered his face with <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and sought to bury it, as it were, under the earth, so that they who had caught him might not behold the shame of his {{misshapen}} countenance. But they dragged him to his feet and they pulled <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from <b>his</b> face and beheld it what it was. Then, when they beheld that his face was like the face of an ape they all shouted aloud again and again with laughter.|$|R
6000|$|... "That 's it! Lecturing!" [...] he exploded, tearing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> roughly <b>away.</b> [...] "Even you are {{beginning}} to lecture me now. I suppose the cook and the stable-boy will be at it next." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must go in alone! No man {{can be your}} {{refuge from}} your husband! Here!" [...] He {{released}} himself, and, kissing the warm little face of the sleeping child, he pressed it into her arms. His fingers touched hers under the shawl; he tore <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> with a shiver.|$|E
6000|$|She {{took that}} comforting hand--it was a {{harmless}} impulse {{that she was}} unable to resist--she bent over it, and kissed it gratefully. He drew <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> from her as if the soft touch of her lips had been fire that burned it. [...] "Oh," [...] she cried, [...] "have I done wrong?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Softly, softly; don't thee {{snap and}} snarl, friend," [...] said Phineas, as Tom winced and pushed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>away.</b> [...] "Thee has no chance, unless I stop the bleeding." [...] And Phineas busied himself with making some off-hand {{surgical}} arrangements {{with his own}} pocket-handkerchief, and such as could be mustered in the company.|$|E
60|$|She clasped <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> turned quickly <b>away,</b> {{and went}} down a lane with the rider.|$|R
6000|$|This time {{he seized}} the Chevalier's ghostly arm above the elbow, {{and gave it}} a mighty squeeze. [...] "I must kill him!" [...] he hissed, and opening <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> strode <b>away</b> down the road.|$|R
5000|$|After dinner, Chow walks {{her back}} to her {{apartment}}. Grasping <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> at the apartment door, she begs him to lend his time to her once more and spend the night. She then asks him [...] "Why can't it be like it was before?" [...] He refuses to stay over, even out of pity, coldly stating that that is simply something he would never lend. He exits by jerking <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from her and remarks in voiceover that this was the last time he ever saw her. He leaves in a taxi, staring emptily into space, as the camera slowly enters a whispering hole.|$|R
