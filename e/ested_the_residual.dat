40|$|The {{influence}} of grinding with two grinding wheels, differing mainly in diamond-grain size, on {{the properties of}} MgO-partially stabilized ZrO 2 ceramics (Mg-PSZ) was examd. <b>The</b> <b>residual</b> stress, <b>the</b> amt. of monoclinic zirconia, {{and the strength of}} the material were detd. From these measurements, depth profiles were obtained for the phase content and <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> stress. <b>The</b> fracture surfaces were examd. optically to <b>est.</b> <b>the</b> crit. flaw size. Material ground with coarse diamond grains was significantly weaker than that ground with fine diamond grains. Coarse diamond grains in the grinding wheel resulted in more residual stress and a thicker layer of transformed zirconia than when fine grains were in the wheel. This apparent discrepancy is explained with a model based on the occurrence of localized spots of tensile stress beneath <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> stress layer near grain boundaries. These spots are assumed to be larger in no. and to contain higher tensile stresses after grinding with coarse grains. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> {{compressive}} strength and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) of concrete, {{which has been}} water-cured after exposure to high temperatures. The relationship between <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> strength ratio and <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> UPV ratio was developed. Cylindrical specimens were made of concrete with water-cement ratios of 0. 58 and 0. 68 and, after 90 days, the specimens were heated in an electric furnace to temperatures ranging from 400 to 1000 degrees C. The concrete specimens exposed to elevated temperatures were cured in a water tank for 72 h and tested after 4, 27, 87 and 177 days. The ultrasonic pulse velocity and {{compressive strength}} of each post-fire-curing specimen were measured. Experimental results show that water curing of the concrete specimens after exposure to high temperatures has noticeable effects on <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> strength and UPV recovery. It is also shown that {{a change in the}} mixture proportion of concrete does not {{have a significant effect on}} <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> strength ratio and <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> UPV ratio of concrete subjected to elevated temperatures. The relationship between <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> strength ratio and <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> UPV ratio was developed and a general equation is proposed for predicting <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> strength of post-fire-curing concrete. Finally, this paper verifies the validity of the proposed equation for predicting <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> strength ratios of post-fire-curing concrete with <b>the</b> measured <b>residual</b> UPV ratios.

30|$|Monitoring {{the values}} of <b>the</b> <b>residuals</b> {{is one of the}} basic ways to measure the {{convergence}} of an iterative solution. This is because the errors in the solution of the system of equations are directly quantified by <b>the</b> <b>residuals.</b> <b>The</b> <b>residuals</b> determine <b>the</b> imbalances of the conserved variables in each control volume. Since in a numerical solution (using iterative method), <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> never gets to zero, a minimum value must be set. <b>The</b> smaller <b>the</b> <b>residual,</b> <b>the</b> more accurate the solution is numerically. The default setting of <b>the</b> <b>residuals</b> in ANSYS Fluent commercial code is 0.001. This value can, however, be reduced to obtain the desired degree of accuracy, however, in a very complicated problem analysis, attaining a very small residual can be challenging (Kuron 2015).|$|R

40|$|The error {{associated}} with a numerical solution is intimately related with <b>the</b> <b>residual,</b> that is <b>the</b> lack of verification of the equation by the approximated solution. <b>The</b> <b>residual</b> is computable but obtaining the exact error from <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> is as difficult as computing <b>the</b> exact solution. <b>Residual</b> type estimators provide error assessment tools based on post processing <b>the</b> <b>residual.</b> This post process is either explicit (integrating <b>the</b> <b>residual)</b> or implicit (solving local problems with <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> as source term). Some of <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> type estimates are guaranteed error bounds. The standard estimators aim at assessing the energy norm of the error.
