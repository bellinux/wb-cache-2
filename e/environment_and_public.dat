40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} experiences of accessibility in outdoor <b>environments</b> <b>and</b> <b>public</b> places for people who are visually impaired. The authors chose an interview based methodology to answer the study´s purpose. Nine people from two different counties were interviewed with semi-structured interview questions, but with the freedom to answer the questions as they pleased. The included criteria´s for this study were acuity less than 0. 3 and to be a member of the visually impaired national association (Synskadades riksförbund). The study was analyzed by a qualitative content analysis that resulted in three categories, "The difference between independence and dependence in accessible environments", "The difference between security and insecurity in accessible environments" and "General ignorance towards accessible environments". The result showed that the physical outdoor <b>environments</b> <b>and</b> <b>public</b> places could both inhibit and enable people with visual impairments, depending on if measures of adaptation for visual impairment had been made. The participants of this study had developed their own strategies to feel involved in activities outside their home. Conclusions that could be made from this study were that outdoor <b>environments</b> <b>and</b> <b>public</b> places could not be fully accessible by people with visual impairment and that there is a lack of knowledge in society regarding the measures of adaptation that is needed.

5|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} is the {{radioactive}} by-product of electricity generation at commercial nuclear power plants, and {{high-level radioactive waste}} is the by-product from reprocessing spent fuel to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. In 1982, the United States Congress established a national policy {{to solve the problem}} of nuclear waste disposal. This policy is a federal law called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which made the DOE responsible for finding a site, building, and operating an underground disposal facility called a geologic repository. The recommendation to use a geologic repository dates back to 1957 when the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the best means of protecting the <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> <b>public</b> health and safety would be to dispose of the waste in rock deep underground.|$|E

5|$|The Fundamental Duties of {{citizens}} {{were added to}} the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976, upon the recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee that was constituted by the government earlier that year. Originally ten in number, the Fundamental Duties were increased to eleven by the 86th Amendment in 2002, which added a duty on every parent or guardian to ensure that their child or ward was provided opportunities for education between the ages of six and fourteen years. The other Fundamental Duties obligate all citizens to respect the national symbols of India, including the Constitution, to cherish its heritage, preserve its composite culture and assist in its defense. They also obligate all Indians to promote the spirit of common brotherhood, protect the <b>environment</b> <b>and</b> <b>public</b> property, develop scientific temper, abjure violence, and strive towards excellence in all spheres of life. However, many of these are non-justifiable, without any legal sanction in case of their violation or non-compliance. There is reference to such duties in international instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 51A brings the Indian Constitution into conformity with these treaties.|$|E
