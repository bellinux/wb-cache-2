Boccaccio, in his {{commentary on the}} Divine Comedy, {{was the first one}} to explicitly refer to the young woman; all later references are dependent on his unsubstantiated identification. Clear documents on her life have always been scarce, helping to make even her <b>existence</b> <b>doubtful.</b> The only hard evidence is the will of Folco Portinari from 1287 which says [...] " [...].item d. Bici filie sue et uxoris d. Simonis del Bardis reliquite ..., lib.50 ad floren"—essentially a bequest to his daughter who was married to Simone dei Bardi. Folco Portinari was a rich banker, born in Portico di Romagna. He moved to Florence and lived in a house near Dante where he had six daughters. Folco also gave generously to found the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova.|$|E

Experimental data are concentrations in aqueous solutions and pH, and must be processed to obtain ionic activity products (IAP). The model of Specific Interaction Theory (SIT) was used here. Firstly, some complexes whose <b>existences</b> are <b>doubtful</b> were removed from the SIT database. The new modified database is given here. Secondly, experimental data were processed.

40|$|It {{has been}} said that a {{technique}} capable of recording a urinary bladder electromyogram could be useful in the clinical evaluation of the detrusor neuropathies and myopathies implicated in the generation of lower urinary tract symptoms. However, in contrast to electromyography of skeletal and cardiac muscle, detrusor smooth muscle electromyography has remained in its infancy despite 50 years of scientific effort. The principal problems appear to be isolation of the real signal from artefacts, and the <b>doubtful</b> <b>existence</b> of electromyographic activity during cholinergic muscle contraction. The discovery of purinergic neuromuscular transmission in the overactive human bladder has renewed interest in detrusor electromyography as, in contrast to cholinergic mechanisms, purinergic mechanisms can generate extracellular electrical activity. In this paper, the development and validation of a novel technique for recording electrical activity from neurologically intact guinea-pig and human detrusor in vitro is described. A purinergic electromyographic signal is characterised and it is shown that detrusor taken from overactive human bladders has a greater propensity to generate electromyographic activity than normal by virtue of an aberrant purinergic mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{model of}} the casein micelle as a roughly spherical, fairly swollen {{particle}} of about 100 nm diameter with a hairy outer layer, is now generally accepted. Several workers have further assumed that {{the core of the}} micelle is built of sub-micelles, i. e., roughly spherical units of about 14 nm diameter, which are fairly tightly aggregated. It was originally assumed that the sub-micelles are held together in the micelle by bridges consisting of calcium phosphate. However, several studies, notably by Holt, have made this concept untenable. This also has made the <b>existence</b> of sub-micelles <b>doubtful.</b> Some years ago, however, van Dijk proposed that in the process of milk synthesis, casein molecules associate into small mixed clusters and that subsequently calcium phosphate is deposited into these particles, which would make them more dense (containing less solvent) and of a lower charge. Consequently, the particles would lose their colloidal stability and aggregate to form casein micelles. This concept agrees well with electron microscopic observations, notably by Buchheim, on milk formation in the lactating cell. It would also fit Brownian dynamics and molecular dynamics simulations of aggregation of small particles exhibiting weak colloidal attraction. Moreover, it readily fits several indications for a dynamic equilibrium between casein micelles and sub-micelles, for which examples of these will be given...|$|R
40|$|Although stream-dwelling {{gudgeons}} (Cyprinidae, genus: Gobio) are {{widespread in}} Central Europe, the taxonomy {{of this group}} {{and the distribution of}} its species are still unexplored in detail. The aims of our study are to ascertain taxonomic composition and distribution of the former Gobio gobio superspecies in the inner area of the Carpathian Basin. Since the presence of cryptic species is suspected in this area, we examined the taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships of Central European Gobio taxa by sequencing the mitochondrial DNA control region (mtCR). Additionally, we characterized the genetic structure of 27 stream-dwelling gudgeon populations of this area by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP). Results of mtCR analysis proved the presence of three species already known as G. obtusirostris (dominant in NW-Hungary), G. gobio (sporadic) and G. carpathicus (sporadic). Additionally, the analysis revealed the <b>existence</b> of one <b>doubtful</b> taxon, G. sp 1 (dominant in NE-Hungary), and a new isolated haplogroup (dominant in SW-Hungary). Although Network analysis showed significant detachment among haplogroups, their genetic distances were quite small. Therefore Bayesian phylogenetic analysis showed weak nodal support for the branching pattern both for newly described haplotypes, and for the already accepted species. AFLP data showed distinct population structure and a clear pattern of isolation was revealed by distance of stocks. At the same time, level of separation was not affected by the altitudinal position of sites. Moreover we found three major clusters of populations which were separated according to hydrographic regions, and corresponded t...|$|R
500|$|Once {{copernicium}} is ionized, its chemistry {{may present}} several differences {{from those of}} zinc, cadmium, and mercury. Due to the stabilization of 7s electronic orbitals and destabilization of 6d ones caused by relativistic effects, Cn2+ {{is likely to have}} a 5f146d87s2 electronic configuration, using the 6d orbitals before the 7s one, unlike its homologues. The fact that the 6d electrons participate more readily in chemical bonding means that once copernicium is ionized, it may behave more like a transition metal than its lighter homologues, especially in the possible +4 oxidation state. In aqueous solutions, copernicium may form the +2 and perhaps +4 oxidation states.
