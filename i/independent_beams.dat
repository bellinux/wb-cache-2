The devices consist of circular micro grating structures combined with nematic liquid crystal (LC) layers with anti-parallel alignment. A single beam deflector converts a polarized and monochromatic green laser beam (= 543. 5 nm) into a diffraction pattern, with the peak intensity appearing at the third order when 0 Vpp is applied and at the zeroth order (no deflection) for voltages above 30 Vpp. Depending on {{the shape of the}} grating structure (non-inverted or inverted), the deflection is inwards or outwards.

Beam electrons interact with monochromatic laser light so that downstream of the interaction point unscattered beam particles (most of them) and strongly collimated Compton backscat-tered electrons and photons exist.
