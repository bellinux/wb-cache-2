500|$|In {{recognition}} of his feats, Cousy {{was inducted into the}} Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971 and honored by the Celtics, which retired his #14 jersey. Celtics owner Walter Brown said: [...] "The Celtics wouldn't be here without him [...] He made basketball in this town. If he had played in New York he would have been the biggest thing since [...] Babe Ruth. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> anyway." [...] In addition, on May 11, 2006, ESPN.com rated Cousy as the fifth greatest point guard of all time, lauding him as [...] "ahead of his time with his ballhandling and passing skills" [...] and pointing out he is one of only five point guards ever to win a NBA Most Valuable Player award.|$|E
500|$|Selected for {{his first}} Sheffield Shield match, against South Australia three weeks after his record {{breaking}} innings, Ponsford—still batting down the order, at number five—made 108. The South Australian (and former Australian) captain Clem Hill watched Ponsford bat and commented, [...] " [...] is young and full of promise; in fact, since Jim Mackay, the brilliant New South Welshman, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the best." [...] In 1923–24 Ponsford continued to score at a heavy rate. Against Queensland in December, he made 248 and shared in a partnership of 456 runs with Edgar Mayne—the highest first wicket partnership by an Australian pair to this day. Later that season, he scored a pair of centuries against arch-rivals New South Wales, accumulating 110 in each innings.|$|E

500|$|Mold {{was popular}} with other cricketers. The Times said: [...] "Apart {{from the burning}} {{question}} of throwing, not a word could be said against him. He was liked by all his brother professionals, and popular wherever he played." [...] However, his achievements were always qualified by suspicion over the legality of his bowling action, even before he was no-balled by Phillips. A batsman who played against him when he first appeared for Northamptonshire said: [...] "If he is fair {{he is the best}} bowler in England, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a worse thrower than ever Crossland [...] was." [...] Mold's Times obituary stated: [...] "He was a deadly fast bowler, but, all through his career, even his best feats in the cricket field were spoken of with something of apology".|$|E
500|$|When the emissaries {{returned}} to Buenos Aires, {{the government was}} worried by the defeats of Rondeau at Sipe Sipe and the political stir generated by José Gervasio Artigas and Estanislao López. Alvarez Thomas appointed Belgrano to head the army at Rosario, but shortly afterwards Thomas resigned. Pueyrredón became the new Supreme Director. With {{the signing of the}} Santo Tomé pact, the aforementioned army was retired from Rosario. Belgrano was then sent back to take command of the Army of the North, with the strong support of San Martín. [...] "In the case of designating who must replace Rondeau, I am decided for Belgrano; he is the most methodical man of all whom I know in America; he is full of integrity and natural talent. He may not have the military knowledge of a Moreau or a Bonaparte as far as the army is concerned, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the best we have in South America".|$|E
500|$|Actor Jim Beaver {{described}} Bobby as a [...] "rough but warmhearted" [...] working-class {{man with}} the outlook that [...] "sometimes {{there are things that}} need to be done and they're not fun to do, but they gotta be done anyway". When the [...] "usually level-headed" [...] hunter must use a wheelchair in the fifth season, he becomes [...] "frustrated and angry"; instead of being able to join the battles, he is [...] "stuck at home manning the telephones". This feeling of uselessness eventually leads to thoughts of suicide, though he deems himself too much of a coward to go through with it. On the situation, Beaver commented, [...] "Bobby lives in a world where all kinds of strange things are possible. Somewhere along the line, he has a hope that one of these strange, miraculous things might happen to him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> also a realist. He understands that even when you have friends that come back from the dead, not everything that you want to happen is going to happen." ...|$|E

500|$|Colbeck almost {{immediately}} left Oldham and dropped back into League Two to sign for Hereford United on a two-year contract. His new manager Simon Davey described Colbeck as [...] "just the ideal attacking winger we've {{been looking for}} throughout pre-season and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the final piece in the jigsaw". Two days later, Colbeck scored two goals in a pre-season friendly victory against Neath before being named as one of six Hereford debutants on {{the opening day of}} the 2010–11 League Two season as his new side won 1–0 at Crewe Alexandra. Colbeck scored his first goal with Hereford on 2 November 2010 in a 2–2 draw with Aldershot Town. Hereford, however, recorded just one win from their first ten league games, and were bottom of the league by October when Davey was sacked. Davey was replaced by Jamie Pitman, who helped to improve Hereford's form. Colbeck received the first red card of his Hereford career for a professional foul during a 4–0 defeat to Southend United on 18 March 2011. His ensuing suspension was one of only two games he missed all season helping him to 50 games in a single season {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E
500|$|In 1908, Chamberlin {{was hired}} to lead the Biology Department at Brigham Young University (BYU), [...] a {{university}} {{owned and operated by}} The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), during a period which BYU president George H. Brimhall sought to increase its academic standing. LDS College professor J. H. Paul, in a letter to Brimhall, had written Chamberlin was [...] "one of the world's foremost naturalists, though, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> only about 28 years of age. I have not met his equal... We must not let him drift away". Chamberlin oversaw expanded biology course offerings and led insect-collecting trips with students. Chamberlin joined a pair of newly hired brothers on the faculty, Joseph and Henry Peterson, who taught psychology and education. Chamberlin and the two Petersons worked to increase the intellectual standing of the University. In 1909 Chamberlin's own brother William H. Chamberlin {{was hired to}} teach philosophy. The four academics, all active members of the Church, were known for teaching modern scientific and philosophic ideas and encouraging lively debate and discussion. The Chamberlins and Petersons held the belief that the theory of evolution was compatible with religious views, and promoted historical criticism of the Bible, the view that the writings contained should be viewed from the context of the time: Ralph Chamberlin published essays in the White and Blue, BYU's student newspaper, arguing that Hebrew legends and historical writings were not to be taken literally. In an essay titled [...] "" [...] Chamberlin concluded: [...] "Only the childish and immature mind can lose by learning that much in the Old Testament is poetical and that some of the stories are not true historically." [...] Chamberlin believed that evolution explained not only the origin of organisms but of human theological beliefs as well.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1995–1996 NBA season, Rodman {{was traded}} to the Chicago Bulls of {{perennial}} scoring champion Michael Jordan for center Will Perdue and cash considerations to fill a large void at power forward left by Horace Grant, who left the Bulls prior to the 1994–1995 season. Given Rodman could not use the 10 jersey as the Bulls had retired it for Bob Love, and the NBA denied him the reversion 01, Rodman instead picked the number 91, whose digits add up to 10. Although the trade for the already 34-year-old and volatile Rodman was considered a gamble at that time, the power forward quickly adapted to his new environment, helped by the fact that his best friend Jack Haley was also traded to the Bulls. Under coach Phil Jackson, he averaged 5.5points and 14.9rebounds per game, winning yet another rebounding title, and was part of the great Bulls team that won 72 of 82regular season games, an NBA record at the time. About playing next to the iconic Jordan and co-star Scottie Pippen, Rodman said: [...] "On the court, me and Michael are pretty calm and we can handle conversation. But as far as our lives go, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> moving in one direction and I'm going in the other. I mean, he's goin' north, I'm goin' south. And then you've got Scottie Pippen right in the middle. He's sort of the equator." [...] Although struggling with calf problems early in the season, Rodman grabbed 20 or more rebounds 11 times and had his first triple-double against the Philadelphia 76ers on January 16, 1996 scoring 10 points and adding 21rebounds and 10 assists; by playing his trademark tough defense, he joined Jordan and Pippen in the All-NBA Defense First Team. Ever controversial, Rodman made negative headlines after a head butt of referee Ted Bernhardt during a game in New Jersey on March 16, 1996; he was suspended for six games and fined $20,000, a punishment that was criticized as too lenient by the local press.|$|E

The {{youngest}} player on the Canadian team, McDavid played his first game against Slovakia on April 18, where he recorded one goal and two assists. After recording a hat trick against Sweden, McDavid was named the best Canadian player of the game. He led the tournament in goals and points while helping Canada win a gold medal for only the third time since the tournament's inception in 1999, defeating the four-time defending champion, the United States, in the final. Jim Nill, then chief scout for the Detroit Red Wings, said of his performance that, [...] "I guess you could say he is kind of The Next One.

2500|$|It {{has been}} speculated that Del Naja is {{responsible}} for creating the artwork attributed to the noted graffiti artist Banksy.

We can sell it now... No disrespect to Robert, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a brilliant artist. I think he has flipped the world of art over.'
