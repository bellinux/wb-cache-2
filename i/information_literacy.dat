40|$|This {{session is}} about integration. It models an {{approach}} to providing workshops on integrating academic sources into assessment texts, which addresses both academic and <b>information</b> <b>literacies.</b> These team-taught workshops have resulted from interprofessional collaboration between a Learning Development Tutor and Learning and Teaching Librarian. They are practical embedded sessions in which students engage in the practices required of them by their current assessments. As well as providing context {{for the development of}} <b>information</b> <b>literacies,</b> the workshops offer a contextually relevant focus on often neglected processes involved in reading-to-write. They also resist the division of these processes into discrete transferrable skills, as can often be the case. The approach has emerged from closer collaboration arising out of a recent institutional reorganisation {{and the creation of a}} new Leaning Enhancement and Support team. This coincided with a move away from ‘deficit’ model and towards timetabled embedded provision. The integrated approach appears to have facilitated widespread commitment to the provision among academic course leaders and subject specialists. The session itself will model this new approach with delegates working collaboratively on short texts and integrating sources taken from the Academic <b>Literacies</b> and <b>Information</b> <b>Literacies</b> literature. This will be followed by a reflective discussion on the challenges and potential of the approach taken...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{two studies}} that explored alternative methodologies that assisted individuals {{to identify and}} critically reflect on their preferred way of being. Central to both studies {{is the importance of}} critical reflection as the pathway to fully informed decisions. In one study the researcher explored how managers considered information issues that influenced their leadership style, including the risks that stem from individual attitudes and actions. The other explored consumer reactions to food system risk and the information desired to reduce such risk. Both studies highlight the need to facilitate the enhancement of <b>information</b> <b>literacies</b> in the workplace and in community settings if people are to consciously choose their preferred way of being. Too often the assumption is that the provision of information is enough to bring about behaviour change. However, as Beck (1992) and Giddens (1991) have observed, in today’s world of flux individuals are confronted with an array of decisions that are complicated by both overwhelming information and competing personal priorities. Academics have a responsibility to champion those approaches derived from research that enhance individual ability to recognise the information needed, including how to source this and the capacity to evaluate and use this (Lupton 2004). This encompasses becoming conscious of the gaps in the information required and the identification of reflexivity when making decisions. This can lead to a challenging of the political context of information access, and result in the adoption of alternative behaviours. The two studies exemplify how individuals proficient in <b>information</b> <b>literacies</b> are more able to contribute positively in resolving both workplace issues and acting to achieve common social goals...|$|R
