25|$|The Dukes of Burgundy, {{who ruled}} the Low Countries in the 15th century, {{used the term}} les pays <b>de</b> <b>par</b> deçà (~ the lands over here) for the Low Countries as opposed to les pays <b>de</b> <b>par</b> delà (~ the lands over there) for their {{original}} homeland: Burgundy in present-day east-central France. Under Habsburg rule, Les pays <b>de</b> <b>par</b> deçà developed in pays d'embas (lands down-here), a deictic expression {{in relation to other}} Habsburg possessions in Europe. This was translated as Neder-landen in contemporary Dutch official documents. From a regional point of view, Niderlant was also the area between the Meuse and the lower Rhine in the late Middle Ages. The area known as Oberland (High country) was in this deictic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located Cologne.|$|E

60|$|France {{therefore}} {{has done}} two things very completely: she has hurled back her Cimmerian Invaders far over the marches; and likewise she has shattered her own internal Social Constitution, {{even to the}} minutest fibre of it, into wreck and dissolution. Utterly it is all altered: from King down to Parish Constable, all Authorities, Magistrates, Judges, persons that bore rule, have had, on the sudden, to alter themselves, so far as needful; or else, on the sudden, and not without violence, to be altered: a Patriot 'Executive Council of Ministers,' with a Patriot Danton in it, and then a whole Nation and National Convention, {{have taken care of}} that. Not a Parish Constable, in the furthest hamlet, who has said <b>De</b> <b>Par</b> le Roi, and shewn loyalty, but must retire, making way for a new improved Parish Constable who can say <b>De</b> <b>par</b> la Republique.|$|E
60|$|The twelfth July {{morning is}} Sunday; {{the streets are}} all {{placarded}} with an enormous-sized <b>De</b> <b>par</b> le Roi, 'inviting peaceable citizens to remain within doors,' to feel no alarm, to gather in no crowd. Why so? What mean these 'placards of enormous size'? Above all, what means this clatter of military; dragoons, hussars, rattling in from all points of the compass towards the Place Louis Quinze; with a staid gravity of face, though saluted with mere nicknames, hootings and even missiles? (Besenval, iii. 411.) Besenval is with them. Swiss Guards of his {{are already in the}} Champs Elysees, with four pieces of artillery.|$|E

60|$|Another instance: M. Guizot, {{when he was}} Minister here, had {{the grand}} hotel of the Ministry, and gave {{entertainments}} to all the great <b>de</b> <b>par</b> le monde, as Brantôme says, and entertained them in a proper ministerial magnificence. The splendid and beautiful Duchess of Dash was {{at one of his}} ministerial parties; and went, a fortnight afterwards, as in duty bound, to pay her respects to M. Guizot. But it happened, in this fortnight, that M. Guizot was Minister no longer; having given up his portfolio, and his grand hotel, to retire into private life, and to occupy his humble apartments in the house which he possesses, and of which he lets the greater portion. A friend of mine was present at one of the ex-Minister's soirées, where the Duchess of Dash made her appearance. He says the Duchess, at her entrance, seemed quite astounded, and examined the premises with a most curious wonder. Two or three shabby little rooms, with ordinary furniture, and a Minister en retraite, who lives by letting lodgings! In our country was ever such a thing heard of? No, thank heaven! and a Briton ought to be proud of the difference.|$|E
6000|$|The {{doors open}} on summons, there need no axes; door after door. And now the {{innermost}} door opens; discloses the long-gowned Senators of France: {{a hundred and}} sixty-seven by tale, seventeen of them Peers; sitting there, majestic, 'in permanent session.' Were not the men military, and of cast-iron, this sight, this silence reechoing the clank of his own boots, might stagger him! For the hundred and sixty-seven receive him in perfect silence; which some liken {{to that of the}} Roman Senate overfallen by Brennus; some to that of a nest of coiners surprised by officers of the Police. (Besenval, iii. 355.) Messieurs, said D'Agoust, <b>De</b> <b>par</b> le Roi! Express order has charged D'Agoust with the sad duty of arresting two individuals: M. Duval d'Espremenil and M. Goeslard de Monsabert. Which respectable individuals, as he has not the honour of knowing them, are hereby invited, in the King's name, to surrender themselves.--Profound silence! Buzz, which grows a murmur: [...] "We are all D'Espremenils!" [...] ventures a voice; which other voices repeat. The President inquires, Whether he will employ violence? Captain D'Agoust, honoured with his Majesty's commission, has to execute his Majesty's order; would so gladly do it without violence, will in any case do it; grants an august Senate space to deliberate which method they prefer. And thereupon D'Agoust, with grave military courtesy, has withdrawn for the moment.|$|E
60|$|Be this as it may, in {{the bleak}} short days, we behold men of weight and {{influence}} threading the great vortex of French Locomotion, each on his several line, {{from all sides}} of France towards the Chateau of Versailles: summoned thither <b>de</b> <b>par</b> le roi. There, on the 22d day of February 1787, they have met, and got installed: Notables {{to the number of}} a Hundred and Thirty-seven, as we count them name by name: (Lacretelle, iii. 286. Montgaillard, i. 347.) add Seven Princes of the Blood, it makes the round Gross of Notables. Men of the sword, men of the robe; Peers, dignified Clergy, Parlementary Presidents: divided into Seven Boards (Bureaux); under our Seven Princes of the Blood, Monsieur, D'Artois, Penthievre, and the rest; among whom let not our new Duke d'Orleans (for, since 1785, he is Chartres no longer) be forgotten. Never yet made Admiral, and now turning the corner of his fortieth year, with spoiled blood and prospects; half-weary of a world which is more than half-weary of him, Monseigneur's future is most questionable. Not in illumination and insight, not even in conflagration; but, as was said, 'in dull smoke and ashes of outburnt sensualities,' does he live and digest. Sumptuosity and sordidness; revenge, life-weariness, ambition, darkness, putrescence; and, say, in sterling money, three hundred thousand a year,--were this poor Prince once to burst loose from his Court-moorings, to what regions, with what phenomena, might he not sail and drift! Happily as yet he 'affects to hunt daily;' sits there, since he must sit, presiding that Bureau of his, with dull moon-visage, dull glassy eyes, {{as if it were a}} mere tedium to him.|$|E

6000|$|... [124] I {{believe that}} for the last two centuries the Latin {{radicals}} of [...] English have been more familiar and homelike to those who use them [...] than the Teutonic. Even so accomplished a person as Professor Crail, [...] in his English of Shakespeare, derives head, through the German [...] haupt, from the Latin caput! I trust that its genealogy is [...] nobler, and that it is of kin with coelum, tueri, rather than with [...] the Greek [kephalae], if Suidas be right in tracing the origin of [...] that to a word meaning vacuity. Mr. Craik suggests, also, that [...] quick and wicked may be etymologically identical, because he [...] fancies a relationship between busy and the German böse, though [...] wicked is evidently the participial form of A. S. wacan, (German [...] weichen,) to bend, to yield, meaning one who has given way to [...] temptation, while quick seems as clearly related to wegan, [...] meaning to move, a different word, even if radically the same. In [...] the [...] "London Literary Gazette" [...] for November 13,1858, I find an extract [...] from Miss Millington's [...] "Heraldry in History, Poetry, and Romance," [...] in [...] which, speaking of the motto of the Prince of Wales,--De par Houmaut [...] ich diene,--she says; [...] "The precise meaning of the former word [...] [Houmout] has not, I think, been ascertained." [...] The word is plainly [...] the German Hochmuth, and the whole would read, <b>De</b> <b>par</b> (Aus) [...] Hochmuth ich diene,--"Out of magnanimity I serve." [...] So entirely lost [...] is the Saxon meaning of the word knave, (A. S. cnava, German [...] knabe,) that the name navvie, assumed by railway-laborers, has [...] been transmogrified into navigator. I believe that more people [...] could tell why the month of July was so called than could explain the [...] origin of the names for our days of the week, and that it is oftener [...] the Saxon than the French words in Chaucer that puzzle the modern [...] reader.|$|E
6000|$|Our candid readers {{know the}} real state of the case {{regarding}} Harry Warrington and that luckless Cattarina; {{but a number of}} the old ladies at Tunbridge Wells supposed the Virginian to be as dissipated as any young English nobleman of the highest quality, and Madame de Bernstein was especially incredulous about her nephew's innocence. It was the old lady's firm belief that Harry was leading not only a merry life, but a wicked one, and her wish was father to the thought that the lad might be no better than his neighbours. An old Roman herself, she liked her nephew to do as Rome did. All the scandal regarding Mr. Warrington's Lovelace adventures she eagerly and complacently accepted. We have seen how, on one or two occasions, he gave tea and music to the company at the Wells; and he was so gallant and amiable to the ladies (to ladies of a much better figure and character than the unfortunate Cattarina), that Madame Bernstein ceased to be disquieted regarding the silly love affair which had had a commencement at Castlewood, and relaxed in her vigilance over Lady Maria. Some folks--many old folks--are too selfish to interest themselves long about the affairs of their neighbours. The Baroness had her trumps to think of, her dinners, her twinges of rheumatism: and her suspicions regarding Maria and Harry, lately so lively, now dozed, and kept a careless, unobservant watch. She may have thought that the danger was over, or she may have ceased to care whether it existed or not, or that artful Maria, by her conduct, may have quite cajoled, soothed, and misguided the old Dragon, to whose charge she was given over. At Maria's age, nay, earlier indeed, maidens have learnt to be very sly, and at Madame Bernstein's time of life dragons are not so fierce and alert. They cannot turn so readily, some of their old teeth have dropped out, and their eyes require more sleep than they needed in days when they were more active, venomous, and dangerous. I, for my part, know a few female dragons, <b>de</b> <b>par</b> le monde, and, as I watch them and remember what they were, admire the softening influence of years upon these whilom destroyers of man- and woman-kind. Their scales are so soft that any knight with a moderate power of thrust can strike them: their claws, once strong enough to tear out a thousand eyes, only fall with a feeble pat that scarce raises the skin: their tongues, from their toothless old gums, dart a venom which is rather disagreeable than deadly. See them trailing their languid tails, and crawling home to their caverns at roosting-time! How weak are their powers of doing injury! their maleficence how feeble! How changed are they since the brisk days when their eyes shot wicked fire; their tongue spat poison; their breath blasted reputation; and they gobbled up a daily victim at least! ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{the other}} side of Tyrrel sat Lady Binks, lately the {{beautiful}} Miss Bonnyrigg, who, during the last season, had made the company at the Well alternately admire, smile, and stare, by dancing the highest Highland fling, riding the wildest pony, laughing the loudest laugh at the broadest joke, and wearing the briefest petticoat of any nymph of St. Ronan's. Few knew that this wild, hoydenish, half-mad humour, was only superinduced over her real character, for the purpose of--getting well married. She had fixed her eyes on Sir Bingo, and was aware of his maxim, that to catch him, [...] "a girl must be," [...] in his own phrase, [...] "bang up to every thing;" [...] and that he would choose a wife for the neck-or-nothing qualities which recommend a good hunter. She made out her catch-match, and she was miserable. Her wild good-humour was entirely an assumed part of her character, which was passionate, ambitious, and thoughtful. Delicacy she had none--she knew Sir Bingo was a brute and a fool, even while she was hunting him down; but she had so far mistaken her own feelings, as not to have expected that when she became bone of his bone, she should feel so much shame and anger when she saw his folly expose him to be laughed at and plundered, or so disgusted when his brutality became intimately connected with herself. It is true, he was on the whole rather an innocent monster; and between bitting and bridling, coaxing and humouring, might have been made to pad on well enough. But an unhappy boggling which had taken place previous to the declaration of their private marriage, had so exasperated her spirits against her helpmate, that modes of conciliation were the last she was likely to adopt. Not only had the assistance of the Scottish Themis, so propitiously indulgent to the foibles of the fair, been resorted to on the occasion, but even Mars seemed ready to enter upon the tapis, if Hymen had not intervened. There was, <b>de</b> <b>par</b> le monde, a certain brother of the lady--an officer--and, as it happened, on leave of absence,--who alighted from a hack-chaise at the Fox Hotel, at eleven o'clock at night, holding in his hand a slip of well-dried oak, accompanied by another gentleman, who, like himself, wore a military travelling-cap and a black stock; out of the said chaise, as was reported by the trusty Toby, was handed a small reise-sac, an Andrew Ferrara, and a neat mahogany box, eighteen inches long, three deep, and some six broad. Next morning a solemn palaver (as the natives of Madagascar call their national convention) was held at an unusual hour, at which Captain MacTurk and Mr. Mowbray assisted; and the upshot was, that at breakfast the company were made happy by the information, that Sir Bingo had been for some weeks the happy bridegroom of their general favourite; which union, concealed for family reasons, he was now at liberty to acknowledge, and to fly with the wings of love to bring his sorrowing turtle from the shades to which she had retired, till the obstacles to their mutual happiness could be removed. Now, though all this sounded very smoothly, that gall-less turtle, Lady Binks, could never think of the tenor of the proceedings without the deepest feelings of resentment and contempt for the principal actor, Sir Bingo.|$|E
