5|$|Belgians began campaigning against Lumumba, {{whom they}} wanted to marginalise; they {{accused him of being}} a {{communist}} and, hoping to fragment the nationalist movement, supported rival, ethnic-based parties like CONAKAT. Many Belgians hoped that an independent Congo would form part of a federation, like the <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> or British Commonwealth of Nations, and that close economic and political association with Belgium would continue. As independence approached, the Belgian government organised Congolese elections in May 1960. These resulted in a broad MNC majority.|$|E
5|$|Genevieve Lhermitte {{was born}} on November 16, 1966 in Brussels to Michel Lhermitte, a {{businessman}} and student, and Marina Schoevaert, a nurse. Lhermitte had two younger sisters: Catherine in 1969, and Mireille in 1972. Though she struggled with her coursework and self-confidence during her secondary studies, Lhermitte graduated in 1991 with a diploma in French and History from the Educational Institute of Social Promotion of the <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> (IEPSCF) in Uccle. It was during the 1988-1989 year at IEPSCF that Lhermitte met her future husband, Bouchaib Moqadem, who was studying mathematics and physics but did not complete his studies.|$|E

5|$|The {{occupation}} of France during the Second World War tarnished {{the prestige of}} the colonial administration in Madagascar and galvanized the growing independence movement, leading to the Malagasy Uprising of 1947. This movement led the French to establish reformed institutions in 1956 under the Loi Cadre (Overseas Reform Act), and Madagascar moved peacefully towards independence. The Malagasy Republic was proclaimed on 14 October 1958, as an autonomous state within the <b>French</b> <b>Community.</b> A period of provisional government ended with the adoption of a constitution in 1959 and full independence on 26 June 1960.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the passage}} of the Loi Cadre by the French National Assembly in 1956, many of the colonies in French West African began to hold {{elections}} to increase the self-determination of their territories. In the first elections held in French Sudan in 1957, the African Democratic Rally (Rassemblement Démocratique Africain, commonly known as the RDA) won the elections in French Sudan, as well as winning majorities in neighboring Ivory Coast, French Guinea, and the Upper Volta. Following the French constitutional referendum of 1958, of which received an overwhelming majority in support, the République Soudanaise declared itself a republic with internal autonomy on 24 November 1958. The Sudanese Republic, as the area was now called, was the second colony after Madagascar to join the <b>French</b> <b>Community,</b> which provided it internal autonomy while linking its currency, foreign policy and defense with France.|$|E
5|$|In early January 1959, {{there were}} {{plans for a}} {{federation}} linking the Sudanese Republic with Senegal, Dahomey, and the Upper Volta in a federation of autonomous states. By April, however, neither Dahomey's nor Upper Volta's legislatures had ratified the federation, and so the Mali Federation was formed with only the Sudanese Republic and Senegal. In 1959, Modibo Keïta's RDA party won all 70 seats in the legislative elections in the Sudanese Republic and joined forces with the dominant party in Senegal, headed by Léopold Sédar Senghor. The federation achieved independence on 20 June 1960 within the French Community; however, divisions between Senghor and Keïta on the governance of the federation resulted in its dissolution on 20 August 1960. The area of French Sudan formally proclaimed itself the Republic of Mali and, with increasing radicalization of Keita, left the <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> in September 1960.|$|E

25|$|The City of Brussels is {{also the}} capital of both the <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> of Belgium and the Flemish Community. The Flemish Parliament and Flemish Government have their seats in Brussels, as do the Parliament of the <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> and the Government of the <b>French</b> <b>Community.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> Commission {{has also}} another capacity: some {{legislative}} {{powers of the}} <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> Commission (for the bilingual language area). The Flemish Community, however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community. This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical federalism. Because of this devolution, the <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> Commission can enact decrees, which are legislative acts.|$|E
25|$|The {{region was}} placed on equal footing with the Flemish Region and the Walloon Region. Nonetheless, Brussels does not have its own community; rather the Flemish Community and the <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> both have {{jurisdiction}} in Brussels. The Flemish Community Commission (VGC) and the <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> Commission (COCOF) were to act on their respective Communities' behalf in Brussels. Brussels divides its funding for the Communities between them, with 20% going to the VGC, and 80% to the COCOF.|$|E

25|$|The <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> and the Flemish Community {{exercise}} their powers in Brussels through two community-specific public authorities: the <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> Commission (French: Commission communautaire française or COCOF) and the Flemish Community Commission (Dutch: Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie or VGC). These two bodies each have an assembly {{composed of the}} members of each linguistic group of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region. They also have a board composed of the ministers and secretaries of state of each linguistic group in the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region.|$|E
25|$|The {{colonies of}} Guinea, the Gold Coast (which became Ghana), and French Sudan (which became Mali) {{followed}} different paths toward decolonization. French Sudan and Guinea were both French colonies and thus after the May 1958 crisis {{were given the}} chance to vote for immediate independence or to join a reorganized <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> (which would grant domestic autonomy while maintaining French defense and economic policy). Guinea was the only French colony in Africa to vote for full independence in 1958. French Sudan voted to join the <b>French</b> <b>Community.</b> The Gold Coast, in contrast, was a British colony which achieved independence as Ghana in March 1957 and joined the Commonwealth of Nations.|$|E
25|$|Belgium {{currently}} {{operates a}} complex federal system {{between the two}} main groups: Flemish and Walloons. There's a division of Belgium into three regions, where Brussels-Capital Region is an independent region, next to Flanders and Wallonia. The regions are mostly responsible for the economy, mobility and other territory-related matters. But there's also a division of Belgium into three communities: the Flemish Community, the <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> and the German-speaking Community. These communities are responsible for language-related matters like culture or education. Brussels doesn't belong to any community, but has a bilingual status. So the Brussels inhabitants may enjoy education or cultural affairs or education organised by the Flemish and/or the <b>French</b> <b>community.</b>|$|E
