5|$|After the <b>Deluge,</b> {{also known}} as The Forty-First Day, is a Symbolist oil {{painting}} by English artist George Frederic Watts, first exhibited as The Sun in an incomplete form in 1886 and completed in 1891. It shows {{a scene from the}} story of Noah's Flood, in which after 40 days of rain Noah opens the window of his Ark to see that the rain has stopped. Watts felt that modern society was in decline owing to a lack of moral values, and he often painted works on the topic of the Flood and its cleansing of the unworthy from the world. The painting {{takes the form of a}} stylised seascape, dominated by a bright sunburst breaking through clouds. Although this was a theme Watts had depicted previously in The Genius of Greek Poetry in 1878, After the <b>Deluge</b> took a radically different approach. With this painting he intended to evoke a monotheistic God in the act of creation, but avoid depicting the Creator directly.|$|E

The new Dark Age is ending, however, and a new Renaissance is beginning. Thon Taddeo Pfardentrott, a highly regarded secular scholar, is sent by his cousin Hannegan, Mayor of Texarkana, to the abbey.

5|$|The <b>deluge</b> flooded 95,000automobiles and 73,000houses {{throughout}} Harris County. Tropical Storm Allison destroyed 2,744homes, leaving 30,000homeless with residential damages totaling to $1.76billion (2001USD, $2.05billion 2007USD). Residential neighborhoods {{inside and}} {{to the north of}} Interstate 610 were hardest hit. Additionally, five of the six bayou systems in downtown Houston were severely flooded. Four of them broke 100-year high-water records, causing excessive surface run-off.|$|E
5|$|The main {{method of}} Candides satire is to {{contrast}} ironically great tragedy and comedy. The story does not invent or exaggerate evils of the world—it displays real ones starkly, allowing Voltaire to simplify subtle philosophies and cultural traditions, highlighting their flaws. Thus Candide derides optimism, for instance, with a <b>deluge</b> of horrible, historical (or at least plausible) events {{with no apparent}} redeeming qualities.|$|E
5|$|Władysław IV's father, Sigismund III Vasa, {{grandson}} of Sweden's King Gustav I, had succeeded {{his father to}} the Swedish throne in 1592, only to be deposed in 1599 by his uncle, subsequently King Charles IX. This resulted in a long-standing feud, with the Polish kings of the House of Vasa claiming the Swedish throne. This led to the Polish–Swedish War of 1600–29 and later to the <b>Deluge</b> of 1655.|$|E

5|$|After the <b>Deluge</b> was {{exhibited}} in unfinished form in 1886 as The Sun at St Jude's Church, Whitechapel; Samuel Barnett, vicar of St Jude's, organised annual art exhibitions in east London {{in an effort}} to bring beauty into the lives of the poor; he had a close relationship with Watts, and regularly borrowed his works to display them to local residents. Following this exhibition Watts continued to work on the painting for a further five years.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional {{objections}} {{were raised}} in House debates as to whether both houses of Congress could constitutionally authorize admission of territories, rather than states. Moreover, if the Republic of Texas, a nation in its own right, were admitted as a state, its territorial boundaries, property relations (including slave property), debts and public lands would require a Senate-ratified treaty. Democrats were particularly uneasy about burdening the United States with $10 million in Texas debt, resenting the <b>deluge</b> of speculators, who had bought Texas bonds cheap and now lobbied Congress for the Texas House bill. House Democrats, at an impasse, relinquished the legislative initiative to the southern Whigs.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{summarised}} his speculation in {{his essay}} on the Elevation of Patagonia. Though tentative, it challenged Lyell's ideas. Darwin drew on measurements by the Beagles officers {{as well as his}} own measurements to propose that the plains had been raised in successive stages by forces acting over a wide area, rather than smaller scale actions in a continuous movement. However, he supported Lyell in finding evidence to dismiss a sudden <b>deluge</b> when normal processes were suddenly speeded. Seashells he had found far inland still showing their colour suggested to him that the process had been relatively recent, and could have affected human history.|$|E

5|$|Local {{television}} stations ran all-night {{coverage of the}} <b>deluge</b> from June 8 through the next day, including KHOU-TV 11, which was forced to transmit its broadcast to a satellite truck when floodwaters entered its production studio on the Allen Parkway near Studemont/Montrose, near downtown {{along the banks of}} Buffalo Bayou. By midnight on June 9 nearly every freeway and major road in the city was under several feet of water, forcing hundreds of motorists to abandon their vehicles for higher ground. Eighteen-wheeled trucks were filmed floating down major freeways and highways, swept along by floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|Messager's career lasted {{into the}} {{beginning}} of the recording era. In New York in November 1918, with the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra, he recorded Les Chasseresses and Cortège de Bacchus from Sylvia by Delibes, Sérénade and Mules from Impressions d'Italie by Charpentier, the Bacchanale from Samson et Dalila and the Prelude to Le <b>Déluge,</b> both by Saint-Saëns, and 4½-minute extracts from Capriccio Espagnol by Rimsky-Korsakov and from Le Rouet d'Omphale by Saint-Saëns. A recording of Véronique on an Edison Gold Moulded Record cylinder was made before July 1907 (actual date unknown).|$|E
5|$|Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Grace dropped heavy rainfall across central Indiana, including a record one-day total of 7inches (178mm) in Indianapolis, while other locations received over 9inches (228mm). Residents prepared sand bags to prevent overflowing rivers and creeks, though rising waters entered streets and over 700 homes. The rapid rainfall in Indianapolis backed up the sewage system, sending {{hundreds of millions of}} gallons of sewage into the streets. Following the <b>deluge</b> in the state, the governor {{declared a state of emergency}} for the state. Eight local American Red Cross chapters arrived to provide meals and aid to the affected people.|$|E

5|$|On August 3, 1915, the Mill Creek (Lake Erie) flooded {{downtown}} Erie. A culvert, or a tunnel, {{was blocked}} by debris, and collapsed. A four-block reservoir, caused by torrential downpours, had formed behind it. The resulting <b>deluge</b> destroyed 225houses and killed 36people. After the flood, Mayor Miles Brown Kitts had the Mill Creek directed into another larger culvert, constructed under more than 2 miles of city, before emptying into Presque Isle Bay on the city's lower east side.|$|E
5|$|Sienkiewicz {{soon began}} writing the second volume of his Trilogy, Potop (The <b>Deluge).</b> It ran in The Word from December 1884 to September 1886. Beginning in 1884, Sienkiewicz {{accompanied}} his wife Maria to foreign sanatoriums. After her death, {{he kept on}} traveling Europe, leaving his children with his late wife's parents, though he often returned to Poland, particularly staying for long periods in Warsaw and Kraków beginning in the 1890s. After his return to Warsaw in 1887, the third volume of his Trilogy appeared – Pan Wołodyjowski (Sir Michael) – running in The Word from May 1887 to May 1888. The Trilogy established Sienkiewicz as the most popular contemporary Polish writer.|$|E
5|$|The New York {{stage was}} filled with ribald humor and sexually {{offensive}} comedy; when movie producers started to put wisecracks in their sound pictures, they sought New York performers. Popular comics such as the Marx Brothers got their start on Broadway in front of live audiences. Censors complained {{when they had to}} keep up with the <b>deluge</b> of jokes in pictures in the early 1930s, some of which were designed to go over their heads. The comic banter of some early sound films was rapid-fire, non-stop, and frequently exhausting for the audience by the final reel.|$|E

5|$|The {{game has}} several modes: Star Trip, Simple, <b>Deluge,</b> and Time Attack. Star Trip is Meteos story mode. Its plot {{centers on the}} evil planet Meteo sending its matter (the meteos) to other planets, killing life and {{destroying}} worlds. After three meteos fuse and launch themselves and other meteos into space, the civilizations on other planets plan a counterattack against Meteo. The player travels from planet to planet on the Metamo Ark, a warship made of metean ore. The story has branching paths, with the last level requiring the player to defeat Meteo itself. The Simple mode allowed a quick {{play of the game}} while letting the player change the rules, such as the difficulty and the number of lives they can have. The <b>Deluge</b> mode meanwhile lasts until the player dies. Time War has two goals: getting the high score in a limited time or launching as many meteos as possible from a set number. The game also has a multiplayer mode, where the player can send up to four other players a demo to play against each other with one game cartridge.|$|E
