On the same day, during a Reddit AMA, Stewart called his GOP primary opponent Ed Gillespie a cuckservative, agreed with a questioner that asked <b>if</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> was a rapist, and wrote “CONFIRMED!” to a questioner who asked if Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe [...] "is a cuck". Virginia GOP chairman John Whitbeck rebuked the remarks, calling some of Stewart's language [...] "racist", and noting that the term [...] "cuckservative" [...] is “used by white nationalists.” ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{challenges}} {{the assumption that}} states are rational unitary actors by examining how, in the United States, the personality traits of the president {{determine whether or not}} he will choose military intervention when the domestic and international conditions align to render it a possibility. These conditions are filtered through the lens of the president 2 ̆ 7 s own cognitive schema, which cannot be purely rational and, moreover, is likely to include a mélange of traits that converge to create a marked preference for action, reinforced and incentivized by the domestic political system. <b>If</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> provides an example of the interventionist impulse among U. S. presidents in his actions in Bosnia, Barack Obama offers an exception through his restraint in Syria. Today, the Trump presidency raises questions about the likelihood of U.

40|$|Objects are {{contrasted with}} properties, {{by means of}} examples, non-{{linguistic}} hallmarks, and linguistic correspondents. Hard cases of objects which are in some respects akin to properties are considered, {{but the idea that}} properties simply are another kind of object is rejected. Finally, properties are seen to be interchangeable with a certain kind of function. One of the most fundamental metaphysical distinctions is that between objects and properties. Given its depth and importance, it’s perhaps unsurprising that, though the distinction can be given in a canonical form, it also admits of some puzzling complexities. By way of a first pass, let’s consider some examples of objects and of properties, and try to extract some hallmarks – linguistic and otherwise – of each. Examples of objects include my cat, you, the tree outside my window, and the planet Earth. These four are all physical objects. There are mental objects as well [...] which, depending upon whether the mental reduces to the physical, {{may or may not be}} a sub-variety of physical objects. Mental objects include: my wish to write a book, the pain I felt just now, my dream last night, etc. So much for examples. Some hallmarks of objects include that they are individual things, which things (at least in the simple cases) have a specific location in space and time. What’s more, objects can be counted. And, in counting, one can always ask: Is this object the same individual as that one, so that it should be counted just once, or are there two individuals here? (E. g., if Samuel Clemens is the same person as Mark Twain, then when Clemens is alone in the room, there aren’t two individual people there: Clemens and Twain. But <b>if</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> and Tony Blair are the sole people in the room, there are two people therein.) Examples of properties – also called ‘attributes’, or ‘qualities ’ [...] include bein...|$|E
40|$|People often {{talk about}} the {{significance}} of Barack Obama 2 ̆ 7 s status as our first black President. During the 2008 Presidential campaign, however, a newspaper columnist declared, 2 ̆ 2 <b>If</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> was once considered America 2 ̆ 7 s first black president, Obama may one day be viewed as our first woman president. 2 ̆ 2 That statement epitomized a large media discourse on Obama 2 ̆ 7 s femininity. In this essay, I thus ask how Obama will influence people 2 ̆ 7 s understandings of the implications of both race and gender. To do so, I explicate and apply insights from the fields of identity performance theory, critical race theory, and masculinities studies. With respect to race, the essay confirms my prior theory of 2 ̆ 2 bipolar black masculinity. 2 ̆ 2 That is, the media tends to represent black men as either the completely threatening and race-affirming Bad Black Man or the completely comforting and assimilationist Good Black Man. For Obama, this meant he had to avoid the stereotype of the angry black man. Meanwhile, though, the association of the Presidency with the hegemonic form of masculinity presented difficulties for Obama. He was regularly called upon to be more aggressive in responding to attacks and more masculine in general. As a result, Obama could not be too masculine because that would have triggered the Bad Black Man stereotype but he could not be too feminine because that would have looked unpresidential. Obama solved that dilemma by adopting a 2 ̆ 2 unisex 2 ̆ 2 style. He was a candidate who was designed to be suitable to either gender. I believe Obama 2 ̆ 7 s unisex performance on the world 2 ̆ 7 s biggest stage suggests that we are all more free to perform our race and our gender as we see fit than we had previously believed...|$|E
