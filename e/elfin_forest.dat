25|$|At {{the highest}} elevations, {{near the top}} of Cerro de Punta, Cerro Maravilla and similar peaks, grows the Bosque enano forest, also known as dwarf forest, cloud forest, <b>elfin</b> <b>forest</b> and moss forest. This forest type is {{composed}} of very dense stands of small, stunted trees and shrubs. The cloud forest has many of the same tree species as the Bosque Micropholis Buchenavia forest, but growth is limited by adverse climate—heavy rain, strong winds, and almost constant cloud cover.|$|E
25|$|The {{major threat}} {{for the forest}} {{tinamous}} is deforestation. Neotropical forests are badly affected, with large tracts being clearcut for cropping, pasture or timber plantations. Much of this land is poor in nutrients, so is abandoned {{after a few years}} for newly cleared land. Forest species are consequently forced to adapt, relocate, or die out. As well as the forests, most types of habitat in Middle and South America, apart from the high Andes and Patagonia, are under threat. There is controversy over the vegetative history with speculation that what is now high-altitude grassland in the Andes was once <b>elfin</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|E
500|$|Its {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} upper montane forests and shrublands. Despite this preference, it is a habitat generalist {{and is also}} found in <b>elfin</b> <b>forest,</b> the edges of cloud forests, Polylepis woodland, brushy forests with Chusquea bamboo, disturbed humid scrub, temperate forests, and dry thorn scrub. It seems to move back into fire-stricken areas at a normal rate for páramo birds, neither colonizing recently burned areas nor waiting for the area to completely recover. This tit-tyrant is most frequently found between , though it can be found at sea level in Chile and up to [...] in the Andes.|$|E
50|$|In the high-altitude Antilles <b>elfin</b> <b>forests,</b> {{low water}} use by {{vegetation}} due to reduced solar radiation, vapor deficit, canopy wetting, and low evapotranspiration rates marks an important water-supply function. With climate change, {{and the introduction}} of invasive species into <b>elfin</b> <b>forests,</b> this function may be lost with the degradation of the forests.|$|R

50|$|Given that {{chaparral}} {{areas can}} be waterlogged in the winter, and arid and desert-like in the summer, native plants in these dry <b>elfin</b> <b>forests</b> have adapted accordingly, and are generally much shorter, smaller, and compact than related plants elsewhere. Diminutive plants {{commonly found in}} Californian <b>elfin</b> <b>forests</b> include Portulacaceae such as Mount Hood pussypaws (Cistanthe umbellata) and Alkali heath (Frankenia salina), and species of Aeonium and bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus). Trees and shrubs, such as chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum), manzanita (Arctostaphylos), ceanothus, sumac (Rhus), sage (Salvia officinalis), and scrub-oak (Quercus berberidifolia) rarely grow more than 20 ft (7m) tall in these communities.|$|R

50|$|<b>Elfin</b> <b>forests</b> in California serve {{important}} roles in regulating stream flow, preventing soil erosion, and preventing evaporation by shading the ground, which keeps the soil moist during dry summer months. Clear cutting for agricultural and economic development, amongst other things, may disrupt these environmental services.|$|R

50|$|<b>Elfin</b> <b>Forest</b> {{is one of}} {{the terms}} used by naturalists to {{describe}} the chaparral vegetation which formerly covered much of coastal Southern California. It is variously known as California coastal sage and chaparral ecoregion, bush-forest, elfin-wood, heath-scrub. The coastal scrub was designed as the best possible means for conservation of the land and habitats that support many endangered plants and animals, including the gnatcatcher. This coastal scrub is now endangered and the state government is studying ways to protect it. The <b>Elfin</b> <b>Forest</b> valley contains one of the largest areas of virgin coastal scrub in Southern California. An <b>Elfin</b> <b>forest</b> is also a type of Dwarf forest in coastal California and elsewhere.|$|E
5000|$|The Podocarpus National Park spans {{from lower}} montane rain forests at c. 1000m up to high {{elevation}} <b>elfin</b> <b>forests</b> at 3000 m. Paramo or subparamo vegetation is found at elevations >3000 m where {{a complex of}} more than 100 lagoons exists, among the best-known being the Lagunas del Compadre.|$|R
50|$|<b>Elfin</b> <b>forests</b> {{occur at}} high {{elevations}} which are generally associated with low vertebrate biodiversity. Hummingbirds and bats make up {{large proportion of}} vertebrates in this area, usually as altitudinal migrants during seasonal shifts, such as for reproduction, or in response to food abundance. Other vertebrate species mostly include small rodents.|$|R
50|$|This swallow {{most likely}} nests in burrows, like the similar blue-and-white swallow, in mossy {{cavities}} or in cavities created in roads. They prefer both subtropical and tropical montane forests {{and the upper}} cloud forest, avoiding clearings. They also prefer <b>elfin</b> <b>forests,</b> usually residing just above the altitudes where the blue-and-white swallow resides, in comparably more forested areas.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Elfin</b> <b>Forest</b> Natural Area is on {{the south}} side of Los Osos Creek's mouth on Morro Bay.|$|E
5000|$|The {{naming of}} the area has also been {{attributed}} {{to the children of}} Dr. Harvey Urban, a prominent San Diego dentist who, along with Jack Donnelley and George Dew, purchased 20 acres for a vacation spot for their families and friends. While Dr. Urban's friends called the place [...] "Tooth Acres", his five children named the spot <b>Elfin</b> <b>Forest</b> from the book <b>Elfin</b> <b>Forest</b> they had just finished reading.|$|E
50|$|The CampgroundThe area's beauty - {{year round}} stream and shade trees, as {{mentioned}} earlier, led Dr. Harvey Urban, Jack Donnelley, and George Dew to buy twenty acres {{at the junction}} {{of what is now}} Harmony Grave and <b>Elfin</b> <b>Forest</b> Roads in 1959. They built a house and a dam to create a lake and began adding spaces for trailers, campers, and mobile homes. Additional land (for a total of 97 acres) was purchased and a grocery store was opened. It was referred to as the <b>Elfin</b> <b>Forest</b> Vacation Ranch. They provided boating, fishing, movies, and square dancing. When Dr. Urban opened those acres up to public camping, the campground and the valley around it became popularly known as <b>Elfin</b> <b>Forest.</b> The campground no longer exists. The property is scheduled for development soon.|$|E
50|$|The royal sunangel (Heliangelus regalis) is {{a species}} of hummingbird. It is endemic to {{subtropical}} <b>elfin</b> <b>forests</b> and shrubs in the Andes of northern Peru and adjacent south-eastern Ecuador. It is endangered due to habitat loss. It is strongly sexually dichromatic, and while females resemble other female sunangels, males are unique with their iridescent dark blue plumage.|$|R

50|$|The Californian climate usually {{exhibits}} wet winters and dry summers. Variation {{in these}} patterns can cause devastating damage to numerous plant communities. Plants found in <b>elfin</b> <b>forests</b> {{have adapted to}} grow during winter months, and become dormant during the summer due to drought stress. Plant communities deal with low, seasonal rainfall by relying on fog interception and taking in moisture from the air.|$|R
5000|$|In {{northern}} California, Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park {{is home to}} an <b>elfin</b> <b>forest</b> with Mendocino cypress (Cupressus pigmaea), and Sargent's cypress (Cupressus sargentii), {{which is}} partially within {{a section of the}} Zayante Sandhill Area. On the Central Coast of California, on the southeastern shore of Morro Bay, Los Osos contains the El Moro <b>Elfin</b> <b>Forest</b> Natural Area. The area is approximately 90 acres. It derives the “elfin forest” title from the short California live oaks, which range in height from 4 - 20 feet, compared to the typical 30-80 feet. This region also contains the federally endangered Morro shoulderband snail (Helminthoglypta walkeriana). At a higher altitude, on Cuesta Ridge, the Land Conservancy of San Luis Obispo County manages the San Luis Obispo <b>Elfin</b> <b>Forest</b> of dwarf cypresses (Cupressus) ...|$|E
50|$|The bird {{occupies}} {{many types}} of habitat, including cloud forest, <b>elfin</b> <b>forest,</b> and páramo. It occurs at 1500 to 2400 meters in elevation.|$|E

50|$|The Perijá tapaculo {{lives in}} {{and on the}} edges of humid rainforests, as well as in <b>elfin</b> <b>forests</b> and amongst woody páramo shrubs in high-mountain {{grassland}} areas, especially at altitudes of 2500 - 3000 m. Some specimens have been observed feeding in dense thickets within 1 m of the ground, often near the forest. Others have been observed running through open grassy areas between bushes.|$|R
50|$|The bird {{is about}} 14.5 {{centimetres}} in length. The plumage {{of the adults}} is dark gray at the upperparts and greyish white at the underparts. The immatures are brownish-grey above and have buffish underparts, and the long legs are pale yellow. It lives in the undergrowth of montane and <b>elfin</b> <b>forests.</b> The call consists of tuck-tick-tick-tuck noises. Nothing is known about its ecology but it is probably a ground-nesting bird.|$|R
50|$|Clusia clusioides is a {{small tree}} which is endemic to Puerto Rico and Hispaniola {{belonging}} to the family Guttiferae. One characteristic are the opposite, very thick leaves. It is very common in the dwarf or <b>elfin</b> <b>forests</b> at elevations above , in particular in areas with much light (e.g., next to service roads in Puerto Rico's El Yunque rain forest). The gray and smooth bark of the tree is sometimes covered with mosses and other epiphytes including orchids.|$|R
