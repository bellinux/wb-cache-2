500|$|A {{spinster}} {{for many}} years, Mavis resisted the advances of men, often {{too shy to}} allow dating to progress beyond {{the initial stages of}} courtship. Ian Randall comments that [...] "Many a man has been smitten with Mavis Riley, but unfortunately she always seemed to attract the drippier of the male species". In 1976 a love interest was introduced for Mavis in the form of Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), {{but it was more than}} a decade before the couple finally married in 1988, after simultaneously jilting each other four years earlier. Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, said, [...] "She [...] was quite a tough little character. You know, a lot of girls would have gone through with , and she stuck to her guns and said 'No, no this isn't right.' Again, dithering and weepy, but she was tough <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> That scene [...] is reflective of the two of them. That was the essence of the friendship, they stuck up for each other and [...] great friends, all the way through." ...|$|E

However, part of her could {{appreciate}} that Hilson does what she wants and that she is confident <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Concepcion further stated: [...] "Then I watched the above interview she did with Perez Hilton, {{and it made me}} respect her even more. She stood her ground and made no excuses for her words or her visuals, and I can dig that." [...] Niki A. M. of Vibe wrote that Hilson [...] "made quite tails wag with her titillating video" [...] and that [...] "men reeled over the scantily clad vixen gyrating and shouting sexplicit phrases like [...] "fuck me" [...] while females seethed in disappointment over her crotch shots that went viral just days ago." [...] Becky Bain, writing for Idolator, stated that [...] "the stilted dialog between Hilson and Columbus Short {{near the end of the}} mini-movie as well as the former's delivery makes the scene come off like the beginning of a porn movie, and unsurprisingly, the scene ends much like a porn movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Manny Weisbord is {{stricken}} by a {{heart attack}} and lies near death, Luca flies an internationally known South African surgeon to Las Vegas to secretly perform the first heart transplant—with a heart from a murder victim supplied by Taglia. [...] With Weisbord lying near death, Goldman and Kordo meet to discuss their uncertain future. [...] Concerned Luca will take them both out if the old man dies, Goldman argues for killing Luca preemptively and insists Kordo {{is the only one who}} can get close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5000|$|I {{know of no}} {{path that}} is better marked than the study of music. Maybe I just think so because it's the path I'm on. There's the old {{question}} [...] "How come there's never <b>enough</b> time <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> right, but there's always <b>enough</b> time <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> over." [...] Well, here's an answer. Settle down. <b>Do</b> <b>it</b> right. However long it takes. That's the direct route to the fast lane! ...|$|R

The rendez-vous for volunteers and trucks to carry them: tonight at eleven, in front of the tent on Montagne Sainte-Geneviève. Thanks to you, no man, no child, will sleep on the asphalt or on the waterfronts of Paris tonight.|$|E
2500|$|Perron {{followed}} {{up the next}} week with a second blog post on the subject. She interviewed Lane who states {{that she did not}} expect to be named during Portman's acceptance speech because a Fox Searchlight producer had asked her to stop giving interviews until after the Oscars were over: [...] "They were trying to create this façade that [...] had become a ballerina {{in a year and a}} half ... So I knew they didn't want to publicize anything about me." [...] Perron then states that Lane [...] "says she was more offended by that myth than any slight to her as a dancer who worked 'painstaking' hours on the set. She says she's talked to her colleagues about 'how unfortunate it is that, as professional dancers, we work so hard, but people can actually believe that it's easy <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in a year. That's the thing that bothered me the most.'" ...|$|E

Lara distanced herself from her father's memory, believing like many others that his obsession had caused him to go mad. After studying at university, Lara gets an opportunity to work on an archaeology program, {{in the search for}} the mythic kingdom of Yamatai. The voyage to find the kingdom results in a shipwreck on an island, which is later discovered to be Yamatai, however the island is [...] also home to savage bandits, who were victims of previous wrecks.

However, she must survive long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> [...] The aftermath of the events of the game causes Lara to see that her father was right, and that she had needlessly distanced herself from him. She decides to finish his work, and uncover the mysteries of the world.|$|E

60|$|It was {{not until}} I had been back in London {{for some time that}} the doctors {{pronounced}} me <b>to</b> be well <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> business. <b>It</b> was not a very welcome permission to me, for I feared that it would be the signal for an inrush of creditors; but it was Summers, my lawyer, who first took advantage of it.|$|R
