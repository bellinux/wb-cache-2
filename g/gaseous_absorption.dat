40|$|One of {{the initial}} steps in the {{preprocessing}} of remote sensing data is the atmospheric correction of the at-sensor radiance images, i. e., radiances recorded at the sensor aperture. Apart from the accuracy in the estimation of the concentrations of the main atmospheric species, the retrieved surface reflectance is also influenced by the spectral calibration of the sensor, especially in those wavelengths mostly affected by <b>gaseous</b> <b>absorptions.</b> In particular, errors in the surface reflectance appear when a systematic shift in the nominal channel positions occurs. A method to assess the spectral calibration of hyperspectral imaging spectrometers from the acquired imagery is presented in this paper. The fundamental basis of the method is the calculation {{of the value of}} the spectral shift that minimizes the error in the estimates of surface reflectance. This is performed by an optimization procedure that minimizes the deviation between a surface reflectance spectrum and a smoothed one resulting from the application of a low-pass filter. A sensitivity analysis was performed using synthetic data generated with the MODTRAN 4 radiative transfer code for several values of the spectral shift and the water vapor column content. The error detected in the retrieval is less than +/- 0. 2 nm for spectral shifts smaller than 2 nm, and less than +/- 1. 0 nm for extreme spectral shifts of 5 nm. A low sensitivity to uncertainties in the estimation of water vapor content was found, which reinforces the robustness of the algorithm.

40|$|Titan's {{atmosphere}} is optically thick and hides {{the surface and}} the lower layers from the view at almost all wavelengths. However, because <b>gaseous</b> <b>absorptions</b> are spectrally selective, some narrow spectral intervals are relatively transparent and allow to probe the surface. To use these intervals (called windows) a good knowledge of atmospheric absorption is necessary. Once gas spectroscopic linelists are well established, the absorption inside windows depends {{on the way the}} far wings of the methane absorption lines are cut-off. We know that the intensity in all the windows can be explained with the same cut-off parameters, except for the window at 2 μm. This discrepancy is generally treated with a workaround which consists in using a different cut-off description for this specific window. This window is relatively transparent and surface may have specific spectral signatures that could be detected. Thus, a good knowledge of atmosphere opacities is essential and our scope is to better understand what causes the difference between the 2 μm window and the other windows. In this work, we used scattered light at the limb and transmissions in occultation observed with VIMS (Visual Infrared Mapping Spectrometer) onboard Cassini, around the 2 μm window. Data shows an absorption feature that participates to the shape of this window. Our atmospheric model fits well the VIMS data at 2 μm with the same cut-off than for the other windows, provided an additional absorption is introduced {{in the middle of the}} window around 2. 065 μm. It explains well the discrepancy between the cut-off used at 2 μm, and we show that a gas with a fairly constant mixing ratio, possibly ethane, may be the cause of this absorption.

40|$|International audienceThe {{study of}} Titan {{properties}} with remote sensing {{relies on a}} good knowledge of the atmosphere properties. The in-situ observations made by Huygens combined with recent advances {{in the definition of}} methane properties enable to model and interpret observations with a very good accuracy. Thanks to these progresses, we can analyze in this work the observations made at the limb of Titan in order to retrieve information on the haze properties as its vertical profiles and its spectral behaviour along the VIMS/Cassini range (from 0. 88 to 5. 1 μm). However, for applications to real atmospheres, one need to account for the widening of the spectroscopic lines (e. g., Voigt profile) and apply an empirical cut-off of the far wings. In general, this is a multiplying function of the wavenumber, f(ν), applied to the Voigt profile that allows a faster decay of the wing profile beyond a given distance {{from the center of the}} line ν 0 : f(ν) = 1 if |ν- ν 0 | ≤ Δν, and f(ν) =exp(-|ν- ν 0 |/ σ) if |ν- ν 0 | 〉 Δν. Although the 2 -μm window is apparently straitforward to model, it appears that the standard cut-off parameters (that is Δν ~ 26 cm- 1 and σ ~ 120 cm- 1) which is used for other windows in Titan's atmosphere is not adequat for this window. Other sets of parameter must be used to reproduce Titan spectrum at 2 μm. However, there is no convergence of the results between these works and a large variety of cut-off parameters are used. Alternatively, it was found that some gas absorptions (ethane and another unknown gas) leave a signature around 2 -μm and also affect the transparency in this window. In our study we make an exhaustive investigation on the cut-off parameters to determine which are the best couples of parameters to fit the 2 -μm window. We also evaluated how <b>gaseous</b> <b>absorptions</b> can allow to reach a satisfactory agreement and, especially, if it allows to match observations with the standard cut-off.

A much weaker but even warmer (~ 700 K) component, which is highly redshifted (+ 100 km s- 1), is also detected, in addition to a cold (~ 20 K) component centered at the systemic velocity of the galaxy. On the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, the column density of CO in the 270 K component is NCO ~ 4. 5 x 10 ^ 18 cm- 2, which in fully molecular gas corresponds to a H 2 column density of NH 2 ~ 2. 5 x 10 ^ 22 cm- 2.

Quasar {{absorption}} lines provide {{detailed information on}} the chemical, kinematic, and ionization conditions in galaxies and their environments, and provide a means for studying the evolution of these conditions back to the epoch of the first quasars.

Absorption spectra of lines of sight through the Milky Way and through nearby galaxies reveal a variety of chemical species, ionization conditions, and kinematic substructures.

40|$|The {{vertical}} {{temperature profile}} of the atmosphere {{has an influence on}} the width and intensity of <b>gaseous</b> <b>absorption</b> lines. In the visible and near infrared part of the spectrum, this poses a problem for the fast forward simulation of the radiative transfer, needed in algorithms for the retrieval of any atmospheric or surface-related parameter from satellite measurements. We show that {{the main part of the}} global variability of temperature profiles can be described by their first 2 to 6 eigenvectors, depending on the accuracy requirement, by performing a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a global set of temperature profiles from the Global Forecast System (GFS). Furthermore, we demonstrate the possibility to approximate the atmospheric transmittance in the O 2 A band for any temperature profile with almost perfect accuracy by a linear combination of the transmittances attributed to each of the significant temperature eigenvectors. For the retrieval of surface pressure from O 2 A band measurements, this reduces the global root mean square error from > 30 hPa to better than 1 hPa by strongly reducing the regional bias of surface pressure, retrieved on the assumption of an average temperature profile. The technique can be applied under scattering conditions to eliminate temperature-induced errors in, e. g., simulated radiances.

In this work, we investigate <b>gaseous</b> xylene <b>absorption</b> in the near-infra-red region (NIR), exploiting evanescent field absorption (EFA) on SOI waveguides covered by a preconcentrating polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film. Estimations of absorption cross section and the PDMS enhancement factor have been made. It has been experimentally observed that 5000 times gas density enhancement is achievable with the PDMS films. The potential benefit of gluing fibers on the grating couplers has been studied and 5 times improvement in the measurement stability with glued fibers has been observed. However, {{in order to maintain}} a better overlap between the grating transmission spectrum and the absorption band of xylene, most experiments were run without gluing the fibers. By using a 350 nm PDMS film on a 1. 2 cm long SOI waveguide, an expected absorption behavior has been observed at a concentration of ∼ 4000 ppm gaseous xylene; which is in a close agreement with an estimate taken with approximately 5000 times PDMS enhancement factor. A rising absorption trend has been observed in the region beyond 1665 nm agreeing with the theoretical xylene absorption band. An absorption measurement for a drop of liquid xylene on a PDMS coated waveguide has been also carried out which gave a further confirmation on the absorption trend observed at ∼ 4000 ppm xylene vapor. It is, however, observed that ensuring measurement and environmental stability can be critical in absorption experiments. For instance, in one experiment, the measured absorption appeared to extend outside the expected region likely due various factors such as mechanical stability and temperature contributing to the system noise.

The present work showed that the path of dehydrogenation of the TiH 2 is d®b®a hydride phase with possible overlapping steps occurred. The fast hydrogen desorption rate observed at the TDS main peak temperature were correlated with the fast transformation of the d-TiH 1. 41 to b-TiH 0. 59. In the <b>gaseous</b> flow, hydrogen <b>absorption</b> and desorption {{were related to the}} transformation of b-TiH 0. 59 Û d-TiH 1. 41 with 2 wt. % hydrogen reversible content.
