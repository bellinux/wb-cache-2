5000|$|... "Common Rail" [...] {{injection}} {{was first}} used in production by Atlas Imperial Diesel in the 1920s. The rail pressure was kept at a steady 2,000 - 4,000 psi. In the injectors a needle was mechanically lifted off of the seat to create the <b>injection</b> <b>event.</b> Modern common rail systems use very high-pressures. In these systems an engine driven pump pressurizes fuel at up to , in a [...] "common rail". The common rail is a tube that supplies each computer-controlled injector containing a precision-machined nozzle and a plunger driven by a solenoid or piezoelectric actuator.|$|E
5000|$|Solenoid or {{piezoelectric}} valves {{make possible}} fine electronic {{control over the}} fuel injection time and quantity, and the higher pressure that the common rail technology makes available provides better fuel atomisation. To lower engine noise, the engine's electronic control unit can inject {{a small amount of}} diesel just before the main <b>injection</b> <b>event</b> ("pilot" [...] injection), thus reducing its explosiveness and vibration, as well as optimising injection timing and quantity for variations in fuel quality, cold starting and so on. Some advanced common rail fuel systems perform as many as five injections per stroke.|$|E
50|$|They {{are limited}} in the number and timing of <b>injection</b> <b>events</b> that can be {{commanded}} during a single combustion <b>event.</b> While multiple <b>injection</b> <b>events</b> are possible with these older systems, {{it is much more}} difficult and costly to achieve.|$|R
40|$|Interchange <b>injection</b> <b>events</b> are {{commonly}} observed by the Cassini spacecraft {{in the region}} between about 6 and 12 Rs (1 Rs[*]=[*] 60, 268 [*]km) and even frequently beyond. In this study, 13 examples of interchange <b>injection</b> <b>events</b> are identified in Cassini/Cassini Plasma Spectrometer data under special conditions such that time‐of‐flight (TOF) mass spectra could be obtained from entirely within the events. Using the TOF data to separate the main ion species H+, H 2 +, and W+, approximate densities of each species are calculated {{under the assumption that}} all distributions were isotropic. The light‐ion density ratios, H 2 +/H+, in the <b>injection</b> <b>events</b> are not discernibly different from those ratios in control intervals from the ambient plasma. However, the water‐group ratio, W+/H+, is significantly lower than ambient. The comparison of the measured density ratios with the range of values observed throughout Saturn's magnetosphere indicates that the values of W+/H+ that are as low as those observed within the <b>injection</b> <b>events</b> are found primarily beyond L~ 14 (where L is the equatorial crossing distance, in Saturn radius, of a dipole field line), indicating that the <b>injection</b> <b>events</b> are delivering plasma from the outer magnetosphere at times traveling at least 6 Rs.

50|$|The strongest {{evidence}} for interchange transport of plasma in any magnetosphere is {{the observation of}} <b>injection</b> <b>events.</b> The recording of these events in the magnetospheres of Earth, Jupiter and Saturn are the main tool for the interpretation and analysis of interchange motion.|$|R
50|$|By {{virtue of}} better {{dispersion}} and homogeneity of the directly injected fuel, the cylinder and piston are cooled, thereby permitting higher compression ratios and earlier ignition timing, with resultant enhanced power output. More precise {{management of the}} fuel <b>injection</b> <b>event</b> also enables better control of emissions. Finally, the homogeneity of the fuel mixture allows for leaner air-fuel ratios, which together with more precise ignition timing can improve fuel efficiency. Along with this, the engine can operate with stratified (lean-burn) mixtures, and hence avoid throttling losses at low and part engine load. Some direct-injection systems incorporate piezoelectronic fuel injectors. With their extremely fast response time, multiple injection events can occur during each cycle of each cylinder of the engine.|$|E
5000|$|This engine uses Toyota's D-4D Common Rail fuel {{injection}} technology operating at ultra high pressures {{of up to}} 135 mpa (1350 bar or about 19,580 psi) which is about 8 {{times more than the}} pressure of conventional {{fuel injection}} systems within a [...] "common rail" [...] that feeds the injectors on all four cylinders. This is combined with a 32-bit ECU which controls fuel quantity, valve-timing, and boost pressure at different engine parameters resulting in best fuel economy and also full utilization of power during acceleration. Pilot injection is also utilized by the common rail fuel system to smooth engine operation. Small amounts of fuel are introduced into the combustion chamber prior to the main <b>injection</b> <b>event,</b> reducing lag time and promoting more continuous and complete combustion. Exterior and interior engine noise is also reduced.|$|E
5000|$|Compression Ignition Direct Injection (CIDI) {{combustion}} is {{a well-established}} means of controlling ignition timing and {{heat release rate}} and is adopted in diesel engine combustion. Partially Pre-mixed Charge Compression Ignition (PPCI) also known as Premixed Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI) is a compromise offering the control of CIDI combustion with the reduced exhaust gas emissions of HCCI, specifically lower soot. The heat release rate is controlled by preparing the combustible mixture {{in such a way}} that combustion occurs over a longer time duration making it less prone to knocking. This is done by timing the <b>injection</b> <b>event</b> such that a range of air/fuel ratios spread across the combustion cylinder when ignition begins. Ignition occurs in different regions of the combustion chamber at different times - slowing the heat release rate. This mixture is designed to minimize the number of fuel-rich pockets, reducing soot formation. The adoption of high EGR and diesel fuels with a greater resistance to ignition (more [...] "gasoline like") enable longer mixing times before ignition and thus fewer rich pockets that produce soot and ...|$|E

After validation of drug use, 185 street-recruited women participated in structured interviews and were offered HIV, HBV, and HCV testing and counseling. Interview topics included (1) demographic characteristics, (2) characteristics of injection partners (IPs), and (3) relevant situation-specific factors. Preva-lence was 28 % for HIV infection, 80 % for HBV, and 70 % for HCV. <b>Injection</b> <b>events</b> were either solitary (n D 110) or social (n D 75). Most were safe, and 75 % of syringes used were obtained from a syringe exchange. Inferential analyses identified two variables that indepen-dently predicted unsafe events: (1) respondent had injected previously with her IP, and (2) her IP was her spouse or primary heterosexual partner. Two trends were identified: <b>Injection</b> <b>events</b> in which women felt “very close ” to their IP or reported lack of control over injection practices tended to be unsafe. Although most events were safe, safe practices were not adhered to with spouses or primary partners. Syringe exchanges should be supported and may be an ideal setting for interventions targeted to drug-injecting couples.

30|$|Multiple Injection (x 3) {{samples were}} Injected {{under the same}} {{conditions}} as described for Single Injections (x 1) with the exception that following the first injection, cell cultures were placed back into the incubator for 1  h before injecting again.

50|$|Interchange {{instability}} plays a {{major role}} in the radial transport of plasma in the Io plasma torus at Jupiter. The first evidence of this behavior was published in Thorne et al. 1997 in which they discovered “anomalous plasma signatures” in the Io torus of Jupiter’s magnetosphere. Using the data from Galileo’s energetic particle detector (EPD), the study looked at one specific event. In Thorne et al. they concluded that these events had a density differential of at least a factor of 2, a spatial scale of km and an inward velocity of about km/s. These results support the theoretical arguments for interchange transport.Later, more <b>injections</b> <b>events</b> were discovered and analyzed from Galileo. Mauk et al. 1999 used over 100 Jovian injections to study how these events were dispersed in energy and time. Similar to injections of Earth, the events were often clustered in time. The authors concluded that this indicated the <b>injection</b> <b>events</b> were triggered by solar wind activity against the Jovian magnetosphere. This is very similar to the magnetic storm relationship <b>injection</b> <b>events</b> have on Earth. However, it was found that Jovian injections can occur at all local time positions and therefore can’t be directly related to the situation in Earth’s magnetosphere. Although the Jovian injections aren’t a direct analog of Earth’s injections, the similarities indicate that this process plays a vital role in the storage and release of energy. The difference may lie in the presence of Io in the Jovian system. Io is a large producer of plasma mass because of its volcanic activity. This explains why the bulk of interchange motions are seen in a small radial range near Io.|$|R

40|$|All Sky Cameras (ASCA) {{observations}} {{were made at}} the field line conjugate of the ATS- 5 Satellite. The field of view of these cameras covered {{the region of the}} magnetosphere from L= 5 to L=ll at the approximate longitude of the ATS field line conjugate. Definite statements are made concerning the correlation of the auroras observed by the ASCA's and the magnetospheric trapped fluxes. No auroras are observed at the field line conjugate, on quiet days when the hot plasma does not penetrate into the magnetosphere far enough to reach the ATS- 5 orbit. On more disturbed days, when the ATS- 5 enters the plasma sheet containing plasma clouds, an equatorward motion of the lowest latitude auroral arc is observed. Significant qualitative correlation between the ASCA data and the trapped fluxes is observed when a local plasma <b>injection</b> <b>event</b> occurs near ATS- 5. The clearest signature of the <b>injection</b> <b>event</b> is magnetic and is most pronounced as a recovery of a negative bay at the ATS- 5 magnetometer.

40|$|Analysis of ATS 5 {{particle}} spectrograms and simultaneous meridian-scanning photometer {{data obtained}} {{at the base}} of the ATS field line has revealed systematic relationships between temporal and spatial auroral morphology and particle-injection events. The details of these relationships depend on previous <b>injection</b> <b>events,</b> the local time of the observatory with respect to current-injection events, and the extent and magnitude of current injections. A persistent zone of weak aurora is related to steady plasma-sheet drizzle, and the equatorward edge of this aurora delineates field lines threading the inner edge of the plasma sheet. Auroras associated with <b>injection</b> <b>events</b> superimpose on this preexisting pattern, with the lowest latitude of new precipitation depending on local time. In general, plasma energization is not required between the equatorial plane and the ionosphere to account for observed auroral intensities. The data indicate occasional occurrence of enhanced loss-cone fluxes, suggesting low-altitude field-aligned acceleration. A summary figure shows how various characteristic auroral-precipitation regions are related to the shape, extent, and orientation of the substorm injection boundary and to the subsequent drift paths of injected plasma...|$|R

Besides, ERG observed a substorm <b>injection</b> <b>event,</b> occurring at[*]~[*] 22 : 30 UT on April 5, 2017, near the magnetic equator. Substorm injections were usually studied based on geosynchronous observations previously (e.g., Chang et al. 2012). ERG {{observed the}} event at radial distances shorter than GEO indicating the substorm injection expanded farther than GEO. ERG successfully captured the dispersionless feature and drift {{echoes of the}} substorm <b>injection</b> <b>event,</b> which showed an explicit and sufficient extent of manifestations and thus provided constraints for us to further develop the previous model. The tens to a few hundred keV electrons observed by ERG and GOES spacecraft were injected from farther tail during the substorm, providing seed populations for ring current, radiation belts and free energy for wave–particle interactions (Miyoshi et al. 2013).|$|E

40|$|Two {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed for solar wind particle injection at the dayside magnetospheric cusps: magnetic merging and cross-field diffusion. These two mechanisms are experimentally distinguishable in that they produce different latitudinal distributions of particles penetrating to the low-altitude cusp. An examination of proton and electron measurements obtained by the AE-C satellite in the low-altitude dayside cusp reveals evidence of both types of injection processes. A majority of the <b>injection</b> <b>events,</b> especially the more intense fluxes, are best explained by a merging injection model in which cusp particles are confined to the poleward side of the last closed field line and have a characteristic energy that decreases with increasing latitudinal distance from the last closed field line. Less frequent and less intense <b>injection</b> <b>events</b> are better {{explained in terms of}} a diffusive injection of cusp particles onto closed dayside field lines with a characteristic energy that increases with increasing latitudinal distance from the last closed field line. Although diffusion appears to be quantitatively less important than merging in terms of the instantaneous particle injection rate, cross-field diffusion nevertheless appears to proceed at an unexpectedly fast rate, possibly exceeding the Bohm diffusion limit...|$|R

40|$|Strong {{electron}} cyclotron harmonic (ECH) waves {{have been}} observed by Cassini associated with local plasma injection regions in the Saturnian magnetosphere. Using measured electron distributions from the Cassini plasma spectrometer, we calculated local growth rates and path-integrated wave gain of ECH waves inside an <b>injection</b> <b>event</b> using the HOTRAY code. We showed that electrons with energy near a few eV have a collision frequency comparable to their bounce frequency; thus, they cannot have an empty loss cone. We then demonstrated that the growth of ECH waves inside the <b>injection</b> <b>event</b> can be driven by electron phase space density gradients associated with the loss cone distribution of injected electrons at energies between a few hundred eV and a few keV. This conclusion is contrary to previous results {{that the source of}} free energy for growth of ECH waves is provided by electrons near a few eV.

40|$|The {{need for}} this thesis comes from the timely {{objective}} to minimize emissions and maximize efficiency in combustion engines. The latest trend in the marine industry is to utilize dual fuel engines as the power source for vessels, allowing the engine to be run on both diesel and gas. In the gas mode, the gas is ignited by injecting {{a small amount of}} diesel, in a so-called pilot injection, into the combustion chamber. The pilot <b>injection</b> <b>event,</b> and the fuel injector creating it, is the topic of this thesis. To be able to understand the operation of a fuel injector, mechanic, hydraulic and electromagnetic theory is presented. Next, fuel injector operation is descripted. Then, a simulation model of the fuel injector is built and verified. Sensitivity analyses are made for both the pilot injection and the full <b>injection</b> <b>event,</b> for the purpose of understanding which parameters affect the injector outputs. Finally, both the pilot injection and the full <b>injection</b> <b>event</b> are optimized in order to reach the emission and efficiency targets. The sensitivity analysis clearly shows that the most important parameters affecting the injector performance are the inlet, outlet and filling orifices. Naturally, also the number of nozzle holes and the hole diameters play a crucial role, a smaller flow area resulting in a faster pilot injection but less injected quantity in a full injection. The pressure step and the needle spring have a lesser impact. The geometry of the needle tip is also important but hard to model accurately. In the studied injector, the control valve was so fast that it did not restrict the pilot injection speed. After optimizing the model, {{it was clear that the}} size of the outlet orifice needs to be increased, and that the sizes of the inlet and filling orifice can be kept roughly the same...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{reported}} that split injection in engines can increase fuel/air mixing and reduce the formation of unburned products of combustion. Large-eddy simulations (LES) of pulsed jets are carried out to understand the mechanism of mixing. The results indicate that in a double <b>injection</b> <b>event,</b> i. e., an <b>injection</b> <b>event</b> with two pulses, an earlier transition and breakup of the head-vortex region in the second pulse {{occurs as a result}} of the residual turbulence from the first pulse and reduced rotational strength of the head vortex. The simulations also predict that there is potentially a balance between the effects of the residual bulk velocity to accelerate the second pulse and the effects of the earlier breakup of the head-vortex region to reduce penetration in the second pulse. Depending on the dwell time between the pulses, one or the other of these effects may be dominant. The computed results show faster spreading and slower penetration of the second pulse, relative to the first pulse, once the head vortex interacts with the turbulent eddies remaining from the first injection. The results are related to observed split injection behavior in engines...|$|E
5|$|This highly {{hypothetical}} {{picture of}} the flux tube exchange was partly confirmed by the Galileo spacecraft, which detected regions of sharply reduced plasma density and increased field strength in the inner magnetosphere.

In the middle magnetosphere, Galileo detected so-called <b>injection</b> <b>events,</b> which occur when hot plasma from the outer magnetosphere impacts the magnetodisk, leading to increased flux of energetic particles and a strengthened magnetic field.

40|$|The basic {{physical}} law {{governing the}} injection in Common Rail Systems is the compressibility of the fuel. The effects of pressure wave dynamics, {{the layout of}} the system volume and its geometrical distribution strongly affect the injection events at every injector. In this Paper, three different arrangements of system volumes and their effect upon the performance of the individual injectors are compared using the hydraulics simulation tool AMESim. Two systems are known in the passenger car and the heavy duty diesel engine domains. The third system is new and takes advantage of pressure wave dynamics to tailor the <b>injection</b> <b>event.</b> This system is best suited for Diesel Engines with a power from 1 to 5 MW, as used in locomotives, ships, power generation and heavy earthmoving machinery. It produces a more favorable pattern of the injection pressure and injection rate shape during any <b>injection</b> <b>event</b> by hydraulically interconnecting the individual injector’s accumulators during the injection and taking advantage of pressure wave dynamics. Right after the end of each injection, dynamic pressure pulsations are evened out with a dampening device. A multi-cylinder system provides equal conditions for all injections. Its very simple design and increased performance makes the novel system of very attractive use in the above mentioned fields...|$|E

However, the LAS technique has been limited to single-shot measurements, which means only one spray image could be captured in one <b>injection</b> <b>event.</b> In order to record the whole vapor phase distribution development in one <b>injection</b> <b>event,</b> a new approach was developed using high-speed video cameras, and n-dodecane with 2 % and 10 % 1 -methylnaphthalene was used as model fuels.

40|$|Nowadays, {{injection}} rate shaping and multi-pilot events {{can help to}} improve fuel efficiency, combustion noise and pollutant emissions in diesel engine, providing high flexibility {{in the shape of}} the injection that allows combustion process control. Different strategies can be used in order to obtain the required flexibility in the rate, such as very close pilot injections with almost zero Dwell Time or boot shaped injections with optional pilot injections. Modern Common-Rail Fuel Injection Systems (FIS) should be able to provide these innovative patterns to control the combustion phases intensity for optimal tradeoff between fuel consumption and emission levels. In this work, a 1 D-CFD model in GT-SUITE of a solenoid ballistic Common-Rail injector was firstly refined respect to the previous work [1] and then it was validated against an extensive experimental dataset of single injections, standard double pilot and multi-pilot injection patterns (up to 4 pilot events) with almost zero dwell time between two consecutive <b>injection</b> <b>events.</b> The experimental hydraulic test data used to validate the one-dimensional model were obtained by means of the UniPG Injection Analyzer based on the Zeuch's method.
