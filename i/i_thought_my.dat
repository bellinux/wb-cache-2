Moshansky, who {{investigated}} the crash in Dryden {{and wrote the}} report, appeared in the documentary, alleging that if the recommendations in his report had been followed, the USAir accident could have been prevented. Moshansky told the documentary that his report [...] "probably sat on somebody's [...] desk." [...] He said [...] "when I first heard about it <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>my</b> God, it's Dryden all over again ... certainly if they had followed the recommendations in my report, the F28 crash at LaGuardia could have been averted." ...|$|E
500|$|For the new songs, Madonna {{worked with}} David Foster, a {{well-known}} producer {{who had worked}} with the likes of Barbra Streisand, Al Jarreau and Earth, Wind & Fire. Foster initially did not expect Madonna would collaborate with him, as he believed that his music would not [...] "really [...] hip enough for her". The recording session with Foster resulted in two new songs to the final track list, [...] "You'll See" [...] and [...] "One More Chance". Foster commented: [...] "At the end of the day, the songs we did were not particularly impressive, though one of them, 'You'll See', was really neat. Madonna had written a great lyric ('You think that I can't live without your love / You'll see') and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> music was great". The track was produced and arranged by Madonna and Foster, who worked on the song during the third weekend of September 1995.|$|E
500|$|Madonna's {{recording}} {{session with}} David Foster resulted two new songs {{to the final}} track listing, [...] "You'll See" [...] and [...] "One More Chance". Foster commented: [...] "At {{the end of the}} day, the songs we did were not particularly impressive, though one of them, [...] "You'll See", was really neat. Madonna had written a great lyric (You think that I can't live without your love / You'll see) and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> music was great." [...] "You'll See" [...] is a low bass track featuring wind chimes and a Spanish guitar. Throughout the chord changes progression to give Madonna's vocals dominance in the song, and after a minute the percussion starts with a tremolo guitar added later. Lyrically, the song talks of independence after the end of a love affair stating that Madonna will go onto greater things. Madonna was asked whether the track was about revenge to which she replied [...] "No, it's about empowering yourself." [...] Madonna later recorded the Spanish version of [...] "You'll See" [...] in Gloria and Emilio Estefan's studio in Miami. Titled [...] "Verás", the song was adapted into Spanish by Paz Martinez. The next original song, [...] "One More Chance", is an acoustic ballad, whose lyrics are about attempting to win a lost lover back. The song was inspired by Madonna's real life experience, but she wrote it from the opposite point of view. Its composition has an organic arrangement, devoid of any synths and sequencing, and only based on guitars with plenty of chord changes and subdued strings.|$|E

2500|$|In the United Kingdom general election, 1997, Squire was {{defending}} a 9,165 majority in his constituency at Hornchurch. His personal popularity plus his prominence as a Minister {{led him to}} believe that he would hold the seat, [...] "This was the one time when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> seat was safe..."

2500|$|According to Stefanakis {{the lyrics}} {{in the chorus}} about being In {{the middle of a}} dream relate to two main ideas: [...] "I'm dreaming if <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> friends would rush to my defence ... he has been betrayed by those he felt would be loyal..." [...] and [...] "Reality check. Let down by chick? Double whammy. Let down by friends".

2500|$|Bolden was re-tried. On August 12, 1964, {{the jury}} found Bolden guilty of the charges and Judge Perry {{sentence}}d him to six years in prison. Perry had the option to sentence him to 25 years and $165,000 ($15,000 plus three {{times the amount of}} the bribe). Bolden was reported to have responded tearfully to the verdict: [...] "If at the time of my arrest I ever embarrassed any agency of the United States, it was because at the time <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> statements were true. I did not mean to embarrass anybody. I ask you, please have mercy. In God's name, please have mercy!" [...] Acknowledging Bolden's apology, Hanrahan told the media: [...] "The verdict completely rejects the outrageous charges made by the defendant and confirms the public's belief in the absolute integrity of the U.S. Secret Service." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band soon {{recorded}} a four-song demo tape in Mars's basement {{and handed it}} to Peter Jesperson in May 1980. Jesperson was the manager of Oar Folkjokeopus, a punk rock record store in Minneapolis, and had also founded Twin/Tone Records with Paul Stark (a local recording engineer) and Charley Hallman. Westerberg originally handed in the tape to see if the band could perform at Jay's Longhorn Bar, a local venue where Jesperson worked as a disc jockey. (The band's first performance at a bar was at the Longhorn on July 2, 1980.) He eavesdropped as Jesperson put in the tape, only to run away as soon as the first song, [...] "Raised in the City", played. Jesperson played the song again and again. [...] "If I've ever had a magic moment in my life, it was popping that tape in", said Jesperson. [...] "I didn't even get through the first song before <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> head was going to explode".|$|E

[...] My life preserver came off and while I was floundering in the water, another hatch cover came up. [...] I grabbed the ring and pulled myself up on it. [...] I saw a foot sticking up from beneath it, and pulling it, {{found it to be}} Thomas McKernan, the son of the chief engineer. [...] I pulled him up and he revived after a while. [...] The lake was covered with wreckage and all around in the fog could be heard cries of [...] "Help" [...] but it was three quarters of an hour before the yawls of the Scott had been loosened and put in the water.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the height}} of his fame in 1999, Tarkan was called up for {{military}} service, which had been legally deferred since 1995. The deadline for beginning his service had passed in 1998, but due to contractual obligations abroad after the success of his compilation album he did not return to Turkey to do his military service. The media discussed whether Tarkan should be viewed as a deserter and stripped of his citizenship. Even the Turkish parliament discussed the issue. After the August 1999 earthquake shook Turkey, legislation was enacted that allowed those covered by the law to pay $16,000 {{for the benefit of the}} earthquake victims in return for shortening their military service obligation to 28 days. Tarkan returned to Turkey in 2000, took advantage of this law, and completed his service. Before entering the army, he gave a return concert in Istanbul as a benefit for an earthquake victims' fund. Of his shortened time in military training, he said: [...] "It was January and snowing like crazy. It was tough; the food was terrible. Eighteen months of my life for nothing? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> own dreams were more important." ...|$|E

2500|$|... but {{the animal}} {{knew better than}} I what was forthcoming, and instead of going faster, so nearly stopped that I remarked he placed one foot after another {{on the ground with}} as much {{precaution}} as if walking on a smooth piece of ice. I thought he had suddenly foundered, and, speaking to him, was on point of dismounting and leading him, when he all of a sudden fell a-groaning pieteously, hung his head, spread out his forelegs, as if to save himself from falling, and stood stock still, continuing to groan. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> horse was about to die, and would have sprung from his back had a minute more elapsed; but as that instant all the shrubs and trees began to move from their very roots, the ground rose and fell in successive furrows, like the ruffled water of a lake, and I became bewildered in my ideas, as I too plainly discovered, that all this awful commotion was the result of an earthquake. I had never witnessed anything of the kind before, although like every person, I knew earthquakes by description. But what is description compared to reality! Who can tell the sensations which I experienced when I found myself rocking, as it were, upon my horse, and with him moving to and fro like a child in a cradle, with the most imminent danger around me.|$|E
2500|$|New York struck first. [...] Josh Devore {{walked with}} one out in the third, and {{advanced}} to third base on a single by Larry Doyle lost in the sun by Duffy Lewis. [...] After Fred Snodgrass struck out, Red Murray's single scored Devore and Doyle for a 2–0 Giants lead. [...] Tesreau and his spitball held the Red Sox hitless {{for the first five}} innings, but Boston then cut the lead to 2–1 in the sixth on a triple by Tris Speaker that fell to the ground untouched when neither Snodgrass nor Devore called for the ball (in an Alphonse-Gaston act), and an RBI groundout by Lewis. [...] The Red Sox scored three runs in the very next inning, on an RBI double by Harry Hooper and a two-run single by Steve Yerkes, after Giants second baseman Doyle had muffed Wood's potential inning-ending double play grounder and had to settle for the one out at second. [...] In the bottom of the ninth, the Giants scored a run and had the tying run on third and the winning run on second, but Wood, a spectacular 34–5 in the regular season, struck out the last two batters for the 4–3 Boston win in a complete game with eleven strikeouts. [...] Oddly, McGraw let relief pitcher Doc Crandall bat for himself for {{what turned out to be}} the last out rather than using backup catcher Art Wilson to pinch-hit. After the game Wood said, [...] "I threw so hard <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> arm would fly right off my body." ...|$|E
2500|$|Repeated {{criticism}} of the Final Report was voiced by Romanian-born Israeli historian and former Radio Free Europe contributor Michael Shafir. In a January 2007 interview with Tapalagă, Shafir had expressed objections to the document's referencing a [...] "genocide" [...] in Communist Romania, arguing that this verdict was exaggerated and unscientific, and objected to Iron Guard activists allegedly being included among the regime's victims, {{in the same category}} as members of democratic forces. Shafir, who nevertheless also stated the existence of [...] "chapters in the report where I wouldn't change one comma", rated the text [...] "a seven, no more than an eight." [...] Accusing Vladimir Tismăneanu's adversaries at Ziua of having a dissimulated far right agenda, he added: [...] "Every time Mr. Tismăneanu was attacked unjustly, I took a stand provided <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>my</b> word counted." [...] In late May 2006, Shafir had joined a group of intellectuals (comprising Liviu Antonesei, Andrei Cornea, Marta Petreu, Andrei Oişteanu, Leon Volovici and others) who together issued a formal protest against Ziua journalists, in particular Dan Ciachir, Victor Roncea and Vladimir Alexe, over their treatment of figures such as Tismăneanu and Foreign Minister Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu, and over their allegedly Iron Guard-inspired and antisemitic rhetoric. Shafir's perspective on the matter of genocide was supported early on by exiled writer Dumitru Țepeneag, who described the [...] "far from perfect" [...] Final Report as having the [...] "not at all dismissible quality of being in existence", while calling its main author [...] "an opportunist".|$|E
