Lowly <b>integrated</b> <b>information</b> manufacturing <b>system</b> uses multiple data storage system for storing data in the <b>information</b> manufacturing <b>system.</b> As a result, lowly <b>integrated</b> <b>information</b> manufacturing <b>system</b> {{was the cause of}} some data quality problems. Therefore, highly <b>integrated</b> <b>information</b> manufacturing <b>system</b> is installed in the organizations. Highly <b>integrated</b> <b>information</b> manufacturing <b>system</b> store data in one single data storage system. Refreshment and query function are to execute in the data storage <b>system</b> of <b>information</b> manufacturing <b>system</b> for making data available and for information support respectively. The tasks of the refreshment function (data loading, indexing) execute sequentially in the single data storage <b>system</b> oriented <b>information</b> manufacturing <b>system.</b> Further, a highly <b>integrated</b> <b>information</b> manufacturing <b>system</b> is developed for executing the tasks of refreshment and query function simultaneously in data storage <b>system.</b> This highly <b>integrated</b> <b>information</b> manufacturing <b>system</b> is the 3 - data storage <b>system</b> oriented <b>information</b> manufacturing <b>system.</b> These highly <b>integrated</b> <b>information</b> manufacturing <b>system</b> could also cause the data quality problems regarding the completeness, accuracy and timeliness data quality dimensions.

A formal mapping between a functional software architecture and a type of ADL is therefore needed.
