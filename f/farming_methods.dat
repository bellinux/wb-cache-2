5|$|Brighton's origins {{lie in the}} Saxon {{fishing and}} {{agricultural}} village of Bristelmestune. The English Channel formed its southern limit, but on all other sides was farmland divided into open fields called laines. These were further subdivided into furlongs—wide parallel strips—and paul-pieces, which were much narrower strips. Despite their small size, neighbouring paul-pieces often had different owners. Wide paths (leakways) ran at right-angles to the furlongs, separating them. This ancient land-use pattern, which survived until the 18th century despite its unsuitability for contemporary <b>farming</b> <b>methods,</b> significantly influenced the pattern of urban development in 18th- and 19th-century Brighton.|$|E
5|$|Major {{declines in}} populations have been {{observed}} from 1980 onward in Sweden, Finland, northern Russia (Karelia) and the Baltic States, and smaller declines {{in much of the}} rest of northern and central Europe. The bird has been adversely affected in these areas by intensive agriculture, and in several countries it has been red-listed due to population declines of more than 50%. Numbers dwindled in the United Kingdom by more than 80% between 1966 and 2004; although populations in some areas such as Northern Ireland were stable or even increased, those in other areas, mainly England, declined even more sharply. The overall decline seems to be due to the low survival rate of young birds, which may be caused by changes in agricultural practices. The intensive <b>farming</b> <b>methods</b> used in northern Europe mean there is less pasture and meadow habitat available, and the supply of grassland invertebrates needed for the nestlings to thrive is correspondingly reduced.|$|E

5|$|At the {{greatest}} {{extent of the}} last glacial period around 18,000 years ago, southern Europe was characterised by cold open habitats, and the Alpine chough was found as far as south as southern Italy, well outside its current range. Some of these peripheral prehistoric populations persisted until recently, only to disappear within {{the last couple of}} centuries. In the Polish Tatra Mountains, where a population had survived since the glacial period, it was not found as a breeding bird after the 19th century. In Bulgaria, the number of breeding sites fell from 77 between 1950 and 1981 to just 14 in the 1996 to 2006 period, and the number of pairs in the remaining colonies were much smaller. The decline was thought to be due to the loss of former open grasslands which had reverted to scrubby vegetation once extensive cattle grazing ceased. Foraging habitat can also be lost to human activities such as the construction of ski resorts and other tourist development on former alpine meadows. Populations of choughs are stable or increasing in areas where traditional pastoral or other low intensity agriculture persists, but are declining or have become locally extinct where intensive <b>farming</b> <b>methods</b> have been introduced, such as Brittany, England, south-west Portugal and mainland Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and Northern England spelled the end {{for most}} of Somerset's cottage industries. Farming {{continued}} to flourish, however, and the Bath and West of England Society for the Encouragement of Agriculture, Arts, Manufactures and Commerce was founded in 1777 to improve <b>farming</b> <b>methods.</b> Despite this, 20 years later John Billingsley conducted {{a survey of the}} county's agriculture in 1795 and found that agricultural methods could still be improved. Coal mining was an important industry in north Somerset during the 18th and 19th centuries, and by 1800 it was prominent in Radstock. The Somerset Coalfield reached its peak production by the 1920s, but all the pits have now been closed, the last in 1973. Most of the surface buildings have been removed, and apart from a winding wheel outside Radstock Museum, little evidence of their former existence remains. Further west, the Brendon Hills were mined for iron ore in the late 19th century; this was taken by the West Somerset Mineral Railway to Watchet Harbour for shipment to the furnaces at Ebbw Vale.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this article}} were to determine the content of total dietary fibre (TDF) {{as well as of}} its fractions – soluble dietary fibre (SDF) and insoluble dietary fibre (IDF) of different cereals grown by conventional and organic farming in Macedonia, as well as to find out the influence of the cereal type and <b>farming</b> <b>method</b> on their values. Standardized enzymatic-gravimetric method (Megazyme Total Dietary Fiber Kit) was used for determination of soluble, insoluble, and total dietary fiber in 27 different cereal samples of wheat, rye, barley, oat, and millet, which were grown at three locations. The content of TDF, IDF and SDF was influenced by both cereal type and farming type. The organically grown cereals, primarily oat and barley, have shown higher values of TDF and of its fractions than the conventionally grown cereals. Their values (% db) for oat and barley for TDF were 42. 00 ± 1. 39 and 21. 91 ± 2. 01, for IDF 39. 22 ± 0. 58 and 15. 06 ± 1. 84 and for SDF 2. 78 ± 1. 25 and 6. 85 ± 3. 85, respectively. Barley grown by either organic or in conversion <b>farming</b> <b>method</b> proved to have the highest value of SDF content among the other cereals investigated, whereas oat produced by organic <b>farming</b> <b>method</b> exhibited the highest values of TDF and ISF content.

50|$|After {{the lobster}} seed is sold to farmers, they are {{normally}} placed into sea cages and grown to adult size for harvest at about 1 kg. This takes about 18- 24 months. Three methods of cage culture exist. The first <b>farming</b> <b>method,</b> is a floating cage, where a frame about 10 to 20 m2 in area {{is supported by}} buoys and holds the lobster cages, and is normally moored in waters 10-20m deep. Such cage method occurs most commonly on Nha Trang Bay. The second <b>farming</b> <b>method</b> is wooden fixed cages, made from 2.5m length by 10 cm width wood with salt resistance, placed about 2 m apart so to create a square shape and normally have an area of 20-40 m2 up to 100-200 m2 with varying cage size. They are usually on or off seabed in areas with little wave activity. Normally such cage methods are found in Van Phong Bay. The third cage <b>farming</b> <b>method</b> is the submerged cage method, made from iron mesh with meshing of 15-16 mm, with an overall size of the cage ranging from 1 - 16 m2 and with a height of 1 - 1.5 m.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{table grape}} {{is one of}} the most {{cultivated}} and consumed fruits worldwide, no study has been reported on its geographical origin or agronomic practice based on stable isotope ratios. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of isotopic ratios (i. e. 2 H/ 1 H, 13 C/ 12 C, 15 N/ 14 N and 18 O/ 16 O) as possible markers to discriminate the agronomic practice (conventional versus organic farming) and provenance of table grape. RESULTS: In order to quantitatively evaluate which of the isotopic variables were more discriminating, a t test was carried out, in light of which only δ 13 C and δ 18 O provided statistically significant differences (P ≤ 0. 05) for the discrimination of geographical origin and <b>farming</b> <b>method.</b> Principal component analysis (PCA) showed no good separation of samples differing in geographical area and agronomic practice; thus, for classification purposes, supervised approaches were carried out. In particular, general discriminant analysis (GDA) was used, resulting in prediction abilities of 75. 0 and 92. 2 % for the discrimination of <b>farming</b> <b>method</b> and origin respectively. CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that stable isotopes (i. e. δ 18 O, δ 2 H and δ 13 C) combined with chemometrics can be successfully applied to discriminate the provenance of table grape. However, the use of bulk nitrogen isotopes was not effective for <b>farming</b> <b>method</b> discrimination. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{focuses on}} the {{comparative}} analysis of composting and land <b>farming</b> as bioremediation <b>methods</b> in hydrocarbon degradation. To achieve this, soil samples from a polluted site were collected at different distances of 10 m- 50 m and were mixed together to have a composite sample. Then Physiochemical, total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) and microbial analysis were carried out after five weeks and {{it was observed that}} there were reduction in the concentration of heavy metals and total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) both for the land farming and the composting <b>method.</b> For land <b>farming</b> <b>method,</b> the degradation of TPH from week 1 to week 5 were 2149. 15, 1916. 45, 1657. 38, 1075. 13, and 397. 03 respectively. While that of composting method the degradation of TPH from week 1 to week 5 were 2149. 15, 2045. 37, 1781. 28, 1232. 72, and 762. 07 respectively. These show high level of efficacy in the use of these methods as remediation techniques. While for the heavy metals there were also a decrease in their concentrations, the decrease were within DPR standard.
