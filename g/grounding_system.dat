40|$|The {{characteristics}} {{and behavior of}} <b>grounding</b> <b>systems</b> are important {{in order to minimize}} dangerous electrical shock. Up to this date, little publication has been made on the field test compared to laboratory and computational method. This could be due to the difficulty to carry out the field test as it requires {{a lot of time and}} high cost for man power and transportation to handle the heavy and bulky equipment. So far, most studies investigated the <b>grounding</b> <b>systems</b> under low-magnitude or low frequency test (steady-state). In this present study, the characteristic profile of <b>grounding</b> <b>systems</b> under impulse condition on two types of <b>grounding</b> <b>systems</b> configurations purposely built inside Multimedia University (MMU) area were investigated. The two types of <b>grounding</b> <b>systems</b> namely the rod beds <b>grounding</b> <b>systems</b> and the MMU combined grid with multiple rods <b>grounding</b> <b>systems</b> are located at different area. From these field experiments, the resistance of the <b>grounding</b> <b>systems</b> are obtained under steady state and impulse conditions.

25|$|The X-axis of {{the system}} was fed by a time base {{generator}} that pulled the beam {{from left to right}} across the screen. Normally a time base is triggered to start its sweep as soon as the signal from the transmitter is seen, but as noted above, this would not provide the accuracy required for this role. Instead, the time base was set to span the screen at a much faster rate, representing only a portion of the signal's overall flight time. Triggering the time base was accomplished using a very accurate oil-filled potentiometer which exponentially increased the charge in a capacitor bank until it reached a trigger value. A very complex <b>grounding</b> <b>system</b> was needed to ensure the accuracy of the voltages leaving the potentiometer system, as any stray voltages could overwhelm the signal.|$|E
25|$|As Mk. I {{arrived in}} the field, a number of {{improvements}} in the basic electronics were introduced. These were collected together to form the Mk. I* version. The differences between the Mk. I and Mk. I* were primarily in details. It was found that in certain orientations of the transmitter and receiver, the small antenna used to trigger the time base would see too small a signal to work. This {{was replaced by a}} cable between the two cabins, which was known as cable locking. Certain details of the RF stages on the receiver improved signal-to-noise ratio, a voltage regulator was added to correct for differences in generators, and a new system was introduced that replaced the complex <b>grounding</b> <b>system</b> for the potentiometer with an electronic version. A more major change was the introduction of anti-jamming features.|$|E

[...] NEMA wiring devices are made in current ratings from 15 to 60 amperes (A), with voltage ratings from 125 to 600 volts (V).

2500|$|Ideally, the {{underground}} {{part of the}} assembly should reside {{in an area of}} high ground conductivity. If {{the underground}} cable is able to resist corrosion well, it can be covered in salt to improve its electrical connection with the ground. While the electrical resistance of the lightning conductor between the air terminal and the Earth is of significant concern, the inductive reactance of the conductor could be more important. For this reason, the down conductor route is kept short, and any curves have a large radius. If these measures are not taken, lightning current may arc over a resistive or reactive obstruction that it encounters in the conductor. At the very least, the arc current will damage the lightning conductor and can easily find another conductive path, such as building wiring or plumbing, and cause fires or other disasters. Grounding systems without low resistivity to the ground can still be effective in protecting a structure from lightning damage. When ground soil has poor conductivity, is very shallow, or non-existent, a <b>grounding</b> <b>system</b> can be augmented by adding ground rods, counterpoise (ground ring) conductor, cable radials projecting away from the building, or a concrete building's reinforcing bars can be used for a ground conductor (Ufer ground). These additions, while still not reducing the resistance of the system in some instances, will allow the [...] of the lightning into the earth without damage to the structure.|$|E

Modernization presents several challenges {{due to the}} personnel, processes, and tools already invested and embedded into the current <b>ground</b> <b>system</b> structure. Every mission's <b>ground</b> <b>system</b> has its own unique complexities and challenges, involving various organizational units. As any mission from its inception to its execution, schedules are always tight. This forces GDS engineers to implement a working <b>ground</b> <b>system</b> {{that is not necessarily}} fully optimized. <b>Ground</b> <b>system</b> challenges increase as technology evolves and cyber threats become more sophisticated. Cassini's main challenges were due to its <b>ground</b> <b>system</b> existing before many security requirements were levied on the multi-mission tools and networks. This caused a domino effect on Cassini GDS tools that relied on outdated technological features. In the aerospace industry reliable and established technology is preferred over innovative yet less proven technology. Loss of data for a spacecraft mission can be catastrophic; therefore, there is a reluctance to make changes and updates to the <b>ground</b> <b>system.</b> Nevertheless, all missions and associated teams face the need to modernize their processes and tools. Systems development methods from well-known system analysis and design principles can be applied to many missions' <b>ground</b> <b>systems.</b> Modernization should always be considered, but should be done {{in such a way that}} it does not affect flexibility nor interfere with established practices.

50|$|Copper {{is vital}} to the {{electrical}} <b>grounding</b> <b>system</b> for wind turbine farms. Turbine masts attract lightning strikes, so they require lightning protection systems. When lightning strikes a turbine blade, current passes along the blade, through the blade hub in the nacelle (gearbox/ generator enclosure) and down the mast to a <b>grounding</b> <b>system.</b> The blade incorporates a large cross-section copper conductor that runs along its length and allows current to pass along the blade without deleterious heating effects. The nacelle is protected by a lightning conductor, often copper. The <b>grounding</b> <b>system,</b> {{at the base of the}} mast, consists of a thick copper ring conductor bonded to the base or located within a meter of the base. The ring is attached to two diametrically opposed points on the mast base. Copper leads extend outward from the ring and connect to copper grounding electrodes. The grounding rings at turbines on wind farms are inter-connected, providing a networked system with an extremely small aggregate resistance.|$|E
