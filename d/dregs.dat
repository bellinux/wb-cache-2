5|$|The commonness and {{centrality}} {{of wine in}} daily life in biblical times is apparent from its many positive and negative metaphorical uses throughout the Bible. Positively, for example, wine {{is used as a}} symbol of abundance, and of physical blessing. Negatively, wine is personified as a mocker and beer a brawler, and drinking a cup of strong wine to the <b>dregs</b> and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God's judgment and wrath.|$|E
5|$|Progressive rock {{came to be}} {{appreciated}} overseas, but it mostly remained a European, and especially British, phenomenon. Few American bands engaged in it, and the purest representatives of the genre, such as Starcastle and Happy the Man, remained limited to their own geographic regions. This is {{at least in part}} due to music industry differences between the US and Great Britain. Cultural factors were also involved, as US musicians tended to come from a blues background, while Europeans tended to have a foundation in classical music. North American progressive rock bands and artists often represented hybrid styles such as the complex arrangements of Rush, the hard rock of Captain Beyond, the Southern rock-tinged prog of Kansas, the jazz fusion of Frank Zappa and Return to Forever, and the eclectic fusion of the all-instrumental Dixie <b>Dregs.</b> British progressive rock acts had their greatest US success in the same geographic areas in which British heavy metal bands experienced their greatest popularity. The overlap in audiences led to the success of arena rock bands, such as Boston, Kansas, and Styx, who combined elements of the two styles.|$|E

25|$|Drinking a cup {{of strong}} wine to the <b>dregs</b> and getting drunk are {{sometimes}} presented {{as a symbol of}} God's judgement and wrath, and Jesus alludes this cup of wrath, which he several times says he himself will drink. Similarly, the winepress is pictured as a tool of judgement where the resulting wine symbolizes the blood of the wicked who were crushed. Connected also to the cup of judgement is the wine of immorality, which the evil drink and which both brings and is part of the wrath of God.|$|E
25|$|Anaconda {{refitted}} at Halifax and Westphal {{received a}} crew of 60 men, {{most of whom were}} the <b>dregs</b> of the fleet, offered by their captains when Admiral John Borlase Warren asked for drafts. Her first task was to escort a convoy of twelve merchant vessels from there to the West Indies. While doing so she fought off an attack by two large American privateers. One of the privateers surrendered after losing her jib-boom and fore-top-mast but then escaped when Anaconda lost her own fore-top-mast chasing after the second privateer. Warren then transferred Anaconda to the Jamaica station.|$|E

The new lineup included Streets bassist Billy Greer and guitarist Steve Morse (formerly of the Dixie <b>Dregs).</b> The first performances of the new lineup with Morse and Greer took place during a third USO 1st Airborne Rock and Roll Division tour that toured US military bases in the US, Japan, Okinawa, the Philippines, Singapore, Iceland and most of Europe during the late summer through early October 1986.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, {{controversy}} did not flare {{until the}} assertions reached {{the general public}} as a commercial best-seller in Stephen Ambrose's Band of Brothers, particularly in sincere accusations by icons such as Richard Winters. In 1995, following publication of D-Day June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II, troop carrier historians, including veterans Lew Johnston (314th TCG), Michael Ingrisano Jr. (316th TCG), and former U.S. Marine Corps airlift planner Randolph Hils, attempted to open a dialog with Ambrose to correct errors they cited in D-Day, which they then found had been repeated from the more popular and well-known Band of Brothers. Their frustration with his failure {{to follow through on}} what they stated were promises to correct the record, particularly to the accusations of general cowardice and incompetence among the pilots, led them to detailed public rejoinders when the errors continued to be widely asserted, including in a History Channel broadcast April 8, 2001. As recently as 2004, in MHQ: The Quarterly of Military History, the misrepresentations regarding lack of night training, pilot cowardice, and TC pilots being the <b>dregs</b> of the Air Corps were again repeated, with Ambrose being cited as its source.|$|E
25|$|Documented {{evidence}} and recently excavated tombs {{indicate that the}} Chinese brewed alcoholic beverages from both malted grain and grain converted by mold from prehistoric times, but that the malt conversion process was largely considered inefficient {{in comparison with the}} use of molds specially cultivated on rice carrier (the resulting molded rice being called 酒麴 (Jiǔ qū) in Chinese and Koji in Japanese) to convert cooked rice into fermentable sugars, both in the amount of resulting fermentable sugars and the residual by products (the Chinese use the <b>dregs</b> left after fermenting the rice, called 酒糟 (Jiǔzāo), as a cooking ingredient in many dishes, frequently as an ingredient to sauces where Western dishes would use wine), because the rice undergoes starch conversion after being hulled and cooked, rather than whole and in husks like barley malt. Furthermore, the hop plant being unknown in East Asia, malt-based alcoholic beverages did not preserve well over time, and the use of malt in the production of alcoholic beverages gradually fell out of favor in China until disappearing from Chinese history {{by the end of the}} Tang Dynasty. The use of rice became dominant, such that wines from fruits of any type were historically all but unknown except as imports in China.|$|E

Many American rock and metal bands have at least one Jewish musician, notably both leading members of KISS (Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley), Geddy Lee of Rush, Aerosmith drummer Joey Kramer, Grateful Dead percussionist Mickey Hart, Bon Jovi (keyboardist David Bryan), the Doors guitarist Robby Krieger, Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian, Ramones' Joey Ramone and Tommy Ramone, and Guns N' Roses drummer Steven Adler, and Disturbed frontman David Draiman; a few prominent UK examples are Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green, and perhaps the most notably the late Marc Bolan of T. Rex, added to all that many Jewish musicians have been and are part of the progressive rock/metal movement including: King Crimson bassist Tony Levin (also from Peter Gabriel's band), Rod Morgenstein (drummer for the Dixie <b>Dregs),</b> Jordan Rudess (Dream Theater keyboardist), Mike Portnoy (drummer for Dream Theater and Transatlantic). Today, some Jews have begun to experiment with forms such as reggae and rap, and artists such as Matisyahu have used forms of secular culture to express religious ideas.|$|E

500|$|In late November 1910, a large naval revolt, later {{named the}} Revolt of the Lash, {{broke out in}} Rio de Janeiro.

The Baron of Rio Branco commented: [...] "For the recruitment of marines and enlisted men, we bring aboard the <b>dregs</b> of our urban centers, the most worthless lumpen, without preparation of any sort.

500|$|... "As {{we enter}} the dog days of summer, we get the summer movie season <b>dregs</b> as well," [...] wrote PopMatters editor Bill Gibron, anticipating August 2013. The year's other dump period {{straddles}} summer and fall, and does not lend itself to being as clearly delineated as the winter dump months. In the past it was usually considered to include all of August and September, and in some years still may. But in years with many major summer movies, some may open on {{the first or second}} weekend of August to avoid competing with other such movies, such as Guardians of the Galaxy, the first-ever August release by Marvel Studios, which took in $94 million on the first weekend of that month in 2014. It was the most successful August opening weekend, and it became one of the year's top-grossing films.|$|E
500|$|The {{two pages}} in {{question}} {{consisted of the}} short sketch [...] "Roderick O'Conor", concerning the historic last king of Ireland cleaning up after guests by drinking the <b>dregs</b> of their dirty glasses. Joyce completed another four short sketches in July and August 1923, while holidaying in Bognor. The sketches, which dealt with different aspects of Irish history, {{are commonly known as}} [...] "Tristan and Isolde", [...] "Saint Patrick and the Druid," [...] "Kevin's Orisons" [...] and [...] "Mamalujo". While these sketches would eventually be incorporated into Finnegans Wake in one form or another, they did not contain any of the main characters or plot points which would later come to constitute the backbone of the book. The first signs of what would eventually become Finnegans Wake came in August 1923 when Joyce wrote the sketch [...] "Here Comes Everybody", which dealt {{for the first time with}} the book's protagonist HCE.|$|E
500|$|This {{technological}} modernization in the Brazilian Navy was not {{matched by}} social change, and {{tensions between the}} Brazilian Navy's officer core versus the regular crewmembers kindled much unrest. A quote from the Baron of Rio Branco, the esteemed politician and professional diplomat, shows one {{of the sources of}} tension: [...] "For the recruitment of marines and enlisted men, we bring aboard the <b>dregs</b> of our urban centers, the most worthless lumpen, without preparation of any sort. Ex-slaves and the sons of slaves make up our ships' crews, most of them dark-skinned or dark-skinned mulattos." [...] Racial differences in the Brazilian Navy would have been immediately apparent to an observer at the time: the officers in charge of the ship were nearly all white, while the crews were heavily black or, to a lesser extent, mulatto. The visual differences belied deeper distinctions: darker-skinned crewmen, who {{by the time of the}} revolt would have been older slaves freed under the Lei Áurea (or sons born free under the 1871 Law of the Free Womb), were almost universally less educated than their white overseers.|$|E
500|$|II.3 {{moves to}} HCE {{working in the}} pub below the {{studying}} children. As HCE serves his customers, two narratives are broadcast via the bar's radio and television sets, namely [...] "The Norwegian Captain and the Tailor's Daughter", and [...] "How Buckley Shot the Russian General". The first portrays HCE as a Norwegian Captain succumbing to domestication through his marriage to the Tailor's Daughter. The latter, told by Shem and Shaun ciphers Butt and Taff, casts HCE as a Russian General who is shot by the soldier Buckley. Earwicker has been absent throughout the latter tale, having been summoned upstairs by ALP. He returns and is reviled by his customers, who see Buckley's shooting of the General as symbolic of Shem and Shaun's supplanting their father. This condemnation of his character forces HCE to deliver a general confession of his crimes, including an incestuous desire for young girls. Finally a policeman arrives to send the drunken customers home, the pub is closed up, and the customers disappear singing into the night as a drunken HCE, clearing up the bar and swallowing the <b>dregs</b> of the glasses left behind, morphs into ancient Irish high king Rory O'Connor, and passes out.|$|E

500|$|Critias and his compatriots, in {{the light}} of these events, decided that Theramenes had become an {{intolerable}} threat to their rule; accordingly, speaking before the assembly of the 3,000, Critias denounced Theramenes as a born traitor, always ready to shift his political allegiances with the expediencies of the moment. Famously, he branded him with the nickname [...] "cothurnus", the name of a boot worn on the stage that could fit either foot; Theramenes, he proclaimed, was ready to serve either the democratic or oligarchic cause, seeking only to further his own personal interest. In an impassioned response, Theramenes denied that his politics had ever been inconsistent. He had always, he insisted, favored a moderate policy, neither extreme democracy nor extreme oligarchy, and held true to the ideal of a government composed of men of hoplite status or higher, who would be able to effectively serve the state. This speech had a substantial effect on the audience, and Critias saw that, if the case were brought to a vote, Theramenes would be acquitted. Accordingly, after conferring with the Thirty, Critias ordered men with daggers to line the stage in front of the audience and then struck Theramenes' name from the roster of the 3,000, denying him his right to a trial. Theramenes, springing to a nearby altar for sanctuary, admonished the assemblage not to permit his murder, but to no avail; the Eleven, keepers of the prison, entered, dragged him away, and forced him to drink a cup of hemlock. Theramenes, imitating a popular drinking game in which the drinker toasted a loved one as he finished his cup, downed the poison and then flung the <b>dregs</b> to the floor, exclaiming [...] "Here's to the health of my beloved Critias!" ...|$|E
500|$|Back at Elsinore, Hamlet {{explains}} to Horatio {{that he had}} discovered Claudius's letter with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's belongings {{and replaced it with}} a forged copy indicating that his former friends should be killed instead. A foppish courtier, Osric, interrupts the conversation to deliver the fencing challenge to Hamlet. Hamlet, despite Horatio's pleas, accepts it. Hamlet does well at first, leading the match by two hits to none, and Gertrude raises a toast to him using the poisoned glass of wine Claudius had set aside for Hamlet. Claudius tries to stop her, but is too late: she drinks, and Laertes realizes the plot will be revealed. Laertes slashes Hamlet with his poisoned blade. In the ensuing scuffle, they switch weapons and Hamlet wounds Laertes with his own poisoned sword. Gertrude collapses and, claiming she has been poisoned, dies. In his dying moments, Laertes reconciles with Hamlet and reveals Claudius's plan. Hamlet rushes at Claudius and kills him. As the poison takes effect, Hamlet, hearing that Fortinbras is marching through the area, names the Norwegian prince as his successor. Horatio, distraught at the thought of being the last survivor and living whilst Hamlet does not, says he will commit suicide by drinking the <b>dregs</b> of Gertrude's poisoned wine, but Hamlet begs him to live on and tell his story. Hamlet dies in Horatio's arms, proclaiming [...] "the rest is silence". [...] Fortinbras, who was ostensibly marching towards Poland with his army, arrives at the palace, along with an English ambassador bringing news of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's deaths. Horatio promises to recount the full story of what happened, and Fortinbras, seeing the entire Danish royal family dead, takes the crown for himself, and orders a military funeral to honor Hamlet.|$|E
500|$|In {{their book}} Education in Popular Culture, Alma Harris, Roy Fisher, Ann Harris, and Christine Jarvis {{analyzes}} the adult education {{aspects of this}} episode that portrays adult learners as [...] "stupid and lazy". After Homer is appointed as a teacher, he feels immensely proud and boasts to all his acquaintances about it, initially making it seem like if the show is indicating that adult education tutors have a relatively high status in society. [...] "However," [...] the authors added, [...] "Homer's pride is undercut for the audience by the awareness of {{how he came to}} be appointed and by the subsequent representation of the adult education center. It seems that anyone can become a tutor. [...] Homer's fellow tutors are drunks, incompetents and down-and-outs, adult education is therefore presented as an amateur business staffed by the <b>dregs</b> of society." [...] The writers of the book thought the whole idea of storytelling and building on experience that Homer uses, and that many adult education tutors uses in real life, is represented in the episode [...] "simply as an excuse for gossip and prurient curiosity". They also thought that statements like [...] "I can't believe I paid ten thousand dollars for this course. What the heck was the lab fee for?" [...] imply that adult education is [...] "exploitative and poor value for money, and that the students themselves contribute to this by demanding an essentially recreational service." [...] The authors concluded that the episode [...] "certainly sustains a popular view of adult education as pointless and recreational. Similarly, no value whatsoever is attributed to the extensively researched, proven through practice and well-argued perspective that adult learners do best when the curriculum builds on and values their experience." ...|$|E
