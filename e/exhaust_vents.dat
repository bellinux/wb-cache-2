25|$|At the party, Bender is overheard {{saying that}} all the robots are doomed, causing panic. Farnsworth arrives with Fry and Leela and {{delivers}} {{a solution to the}} robots; every last one needs to blast their <b>exhaust</b> <b>vents</b> at the same time, straight up in the sky, in order to push the Earth farther from the Sun, thus cooling the Earth and causing the EMP cannon to miss its target. During the panic Bender and the turtle are knocked onto their backs and cannot get up, leaving not enough exhaust to move the Earth. As Bender is lamenting his fate, the turtle rocks from side to side and rolls to its feet. Shocked and inspired, but not to be shown up, Bender does the same, allowing him to release his massive exhaust, just barely saving the robots from the EMP. Farnsworth receives a medal of pollution for his work, and the extra week caused by the new orbit of the Earth is declared Robot Party Week.|$|E

The U.S. Navy, Coast Guard and Drug Enforcement Administration officials say South American drug cartels are turning to semi-submersible vessels, which have a low profile to avoid detection, because of the government's success at thwarting other smuggling techniques, including the use of fishing trawlers and speed boats.|$|E

40|$|Study of the {{unsteady}} {{burning of}} solid propellants can be best carried out under widely varying conditions and at relatively inexpensive cost {{in a simple}} test device known as the T-burner. This simple configuration is used to observe the spontaneous growth and decay of oscillations. Knowing the losses involved in the system, one can infer the frequency response of the burning surface within the approximations of linearity. A significant undertainty {{in the interpretation of}} data taken with T-burners arises because very little has been known about some of the acoustics, in particular the influence of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>vent.</b> The present investigation is a study of the influence of a subsonic <b>exhaust</b> <b>vent.</b> The primary apparatus is a resonance tube operated at room temperature with different resonance frequencies of the first longitudinal mode of oscillation. Experiments have been done over ranges of the average Mach number of the flow in the resonance tube, and with vent having different sizes and shapes. According to the one-dimensional linear stability analysis, the attenuation constant associated with the influence of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>vent</b> is given by the product of four times the resonance frequency of oscillation times the average Mach number of the flow in the resonance tube. The following major conclusions were predicted and verified: (i) the vent produces a gain of acoustic energy proportional to the average Mach number of the flow in main resonance tube (ii) the gain is proportional to the frequency of the fundamental longitudinal mode (iii) the gain is independent of the shape and size of the vent. The influence of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>vent,</b> hence, cannot be neglected in the interpretation of T-burner data...|$|R

40|$|Data were {{obtained}} for a resonance tube having a vent at the center in the lateral boundary, an average flow being introduced at the ends.

The gain of acoustic energy increases approximately linearly with the Mach number, as predicted by the one-dimensional analysis.
