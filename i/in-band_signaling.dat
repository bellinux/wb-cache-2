50|$|Out-of-band, {{indicating}} that the control signals are sent separately from the data, {{is in contrast to}} <b>in-band</b> <b>signalling</b> where the control is sent as special forms of data communications. An example of <b>in-band</b> <b>signalling</b> would be Escape sequence coding.|$|R

50|$|<b>In-band</b> <b>signalling</b> {{began to}} {{disappear}} as electronic switching systems displaced mechanical switchgear.|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} programming, {{an example}} of <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> are magic numbers, used for signaling of file formats.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a part of}} this sequence, {{the local}} {{transcoder}} sends TFO <b>In-band</b> <b>Signalling</b> messages (IS_Messages) on the LSBs of the PCM samples. The protocol is very well defined in the specification documents.|$|R
50|$|It is {{used with}} V.22 and V.22bis {{modulation}} modes {{to prevent the}} high-band data signal from interfering with the operation of billing apparatus in certain countries where <b>in-band</b> <b>signalling</b> was commonplace in the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|North American Bell 103-style modems (300 bit/s) were {{incompatible}} with UK <b>in-band</b> <b>signalling</b> (the modem tones would disconnect the call) unless a guard tone is provided. Most of these (now-obsolete) modems {{did not support}} any command set and were unusable for international calls.|$|R
50|$|Whereas common-channel {{signaling}} {{systems are}} out-of-band by definition, and <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> systems are also necessarily channel-associated, the above metering pulse example demonstrates that there exist channel-associated signaling systems which are out-of-band.|$|E
50|$|<b>In-band</b> <b>signaling</b> {{applies only}} to {{channel-associated}} signaling (CAS). In common channel signaling (CCS) separate channels are used for control and data, {{as opposed to the}} shared channel in CAS, so all control is out-of-band by definition.|$|E
50|$|When dialing from a {{land-line}} telephone, {{the telephone}} number is encoded and transmitted across the telephone line {{in form of}} dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF). The tones control the telephone system by instructing the telephone switch where to route the call. These control tones are sent over the same channel, the copper wire, and in the frequency range (300 Hz to 3.4 kHz) as the audio of the telephone call. <b>In-band</b> <b>signaling</b> is also used on older telephone carrier systems to provide inter-exchange information for routing calls. Examples {{of this kind of}} <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> system are the Signaling System No. 5 (SS5) and R2 signalling.|$|E
50|$|XTCSS is {{the newest}} {{signaling}} technique and it provides 99 codes with the added advantage of 'silent operation'.

50|$|Token-based folding {{requires}} <b>in-band</b> <b>signalling,</b> with folding tokens essentially being structured comments, {{and unlike}} other methods, {{are present in}} the source code and visible to other programmers. This allows them to be shared, but also requires their use (or preservation) by all programmers working on a particular file, and can cause friction and maintenance burden.|$|R
50|$|In the Internet Protocol Version 4, {{the address}} 0.0.0.0 is a non-routable meta-address used to {{designate}} an invalid, unknown or non-applicable target.To give a special meaning to an otherwise invalid {{piece of data}} is an application of <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the public}} {{switched}} telephone network (PSTN), <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> is {{the exchange of}} call control information within the same channel that the telephone call itself is using. An example is dual-tone multi-frequency signaling (DTMF), which is used on most telephone lines to customer premises.|$|E
5000|$|A few poorly-regarded but still-used {{protocols}} use <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling,</b> causing confusion if specific patterns {{appear in}} the message. The best-known is the string [...] "From [...] " [...] (including trailing space) {{at the beginning of}} a line used to separate mail messages in the mbox file format.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{explicit}} PCP security {{mechanisms are}} available as extensions to the PCP protocol, providing authentication and {{access control mechanisms}} by using an authenticated and integrity-protected <b>in-band</b> <b>signalling</b> channel, which relies on Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to perform the authentication between devices involved in a PCP negotiation session. Such PCP-enabled NAT devices or firewalls may still accept unauthenticated mapping requests; at the same time, all previously described explicit mapping constraints still apply.|$|R
50|$|Canada {{formerly}} used a US-style ACTS {{coin phone}} {{system with a}} tone pair which would beep once for a nickel, twice for a dime and five times on receiving a quarter. These phones did not accept $1 coins (or the later $2 coin) and disappeared with the roll-out of Nortel Millennium payphones in the 1990s. The Millennium sets do not use ACTS <b>in-band</b> <b>signalling</b> tones as all coin-handling is automated in the phone itself.|$|R
40|$|Co-existing {{wireless}} systems, {{which share}} a common spectrum, need to mitigate out-of-band (OOB) radiation to avoid excessive interference. For legacy systems, OOB radiation is well understood and is commonly handled by digital precompensation techniques. When using large arrays, however, new phenomena and hardware limitations have to be considered. First, signals can be radiated directionally, which might focus the OOB radiation. Second, low-complexity hardware is used for cost reasons, which increases the relative amount of OOB radiation. Given that massive MIMO and millimeter wave communication rely on base stations {{with a large number}} of antennas, the spatial behavior of OOB radiation from large arrays will have significant implications for the hardware requirements of future base stations. We show that, if the OOB radiation is beamformed, its array gain is never larger than that of the <b>in-band</b> <b>signal.</b> In many cases, the OOB radiation is close to isotropic even when the <b>in-band</b> <b>signal</b> is highly directive. With the same total radiated power, the OOB radiation from large arrays is therefore never more severe than from a legacy system with the same adjacent-channel-leakage ratio. Further, the OOB radiation is less detrimental than from a legacy system since the high array gain of the <b>in-band</b> <b>signal</b> allows large arrays to radiate less total power than legacy systems. We also show how OOB radiation from large arrays varies with location in static propagation environments and how these effects vanish when averaged over the small-scale fading. Since a higher relative amount of OOB radiation can be tolerated for large arrays, the linearity requirement can be relaxed as compared to legacy systems. Specifically, less stringent linearity requirements on each transmitter makes it possible to build large arrays from low-complexity hardware...|$|R
50|$|A subaudible tone is a {{tone that}} is used to trigger an {{automated}} event at a radio station. A subaudible tone is audible; however, it is usually at a low level that is not noticeable to the average listener at normal volumes. It is a form of <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling.</b>|$|E
50|$|Line {{signaling}} {{can also}} be conveyed within the channels being supervised, as in the original T1 scheme which used {{one out of every}} eight bits for supervision, or with robbed bits of a superframe format, or as <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling,</b> e.g. as in L1 signaling where 2280 Hz tone pulses are used.|$|E
50|$|A {{blue box}} is an {{electronic}} device that simulated an operator by generating the same tones employed by a telephone operator's dialing console to, for example, switch long-distance calls. A blue box {{is a tool}} {{that emerged in the}} 1960s and '70s; it allowed users to route their own calls by emulating the <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> mechanism that then controlled switching in long distance dialing systems. The most typical use of a blue box was to place free telephone calls. A related device, the black box, enabled one to receive calls which were free to the caller. The blue box no longer works in most Western nations, as modern switching systems do not use <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling.</b> Instead, signaling occurs on an out-of-band channel which cannot be accessed from the line the caller is using, a system called Common Channel Interoffice Signaling or CCIS.|$|E
40|$|Practical {{cooperative}} diversity protocols often rely on low-cost radios that treat multiple <b>in-band</b> <b>signals</b> as {{noise and}} thus require strictly orthogonal transmissions. We analyze {{the performance of}} a class of opportunistic relaying protocols that employ simple packet level feedback and strictly orthogonal transmissions. It is shown that the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the proposed protocols either matches or outperforms the multi-input-single-output (MISO), zero-feedback performance. These gains indicate that low complexity radios and feedback could be an appealing architecture for future user cooperation protocols...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} improve both power and {{spectral}} efficiency, countermeasures {{have to be put}} in place. Transmitter techniques, known as digital predistortion (DPD), pre-process the signal with an equivalent inverse channel function to reduce the generated interference while receiver equalization (EQ) performs traditional interference cancellation [6]. Mitigation techniques usually have different goals. Compared to terrestrial telecommunications where DPD techniques mainly aim to suppress the out-of-band emissions [7], satellite communications aim to reduce <b>in-band</b> <b>signal</b> distortion [8, 9] since the out-of-band emissions are cut-out by the onboard multiplexing filter following the HPA in the satellite transponder.|$|R
40|$|Photonic {{choke joint}} (PCJ) {{structures}} for dual-polarization waveguides {{have been investigated}} for use in device and component packaging. This interface enables the realization of a high performance non-contacting waveguide joint without degrading the <b>in-band</b> <b>signal</b> propagation properties. The choke properties of two tiling approaches, symmetric square Cartesian and octagonal quasi-crystal lattices of metallic posts, are explored and optimal PCJ design parameters are presented. For each of these schemes, the experimental results for structures with finite tilings demonstrate near ideal transmission and reflection performance over a full waveguide band...|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s, <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> was used, so {{the same}} line for both voice conversations and {{telephone}} connection management signals. Since a pause in a voice conversation would produce silence, another method was required for switches to determine available circuits. The solution AT&T created was to produce a 2600 Hz tone on idling trunks.|$|E
50|$|In computing, ANSI escape codes (or escape sequences) are {{a method}} using <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> {{to control the}} {{formatting}}, color, and other output options on video text terminals. To encode this formatting information, certain sequences of bytes are embedded into the text, which the terminal looks for and interprets as commands, not as character codes.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunications, <b>in-band</b> <b>signaling</b> is {{the sending}} of control {{information}} {{within the same}} band or channel used for voice or video. This {{is in contrast to}} out-of-band signaling which is sent over a different channel, or even over a separate network. In-band signals may often be heard by telephony participants, while out-of-band signals are inaccessible to the user.|$|E
50|$|Many {{companies}} {{are involved with}} telematics technology to use in different aspects of eCall including in-vehicle systems, wireless data delivery, and public safety answering point systems. Standardization of communication protocols and human language issues {{are some of the}} obstacles. Prototypes have been successfully tested with GPRS and <b>in-band</b> <b>signalling</b> over cellular networks. At the same time proprietary eCall solutions that rely on SMS exist already today from car makers such as BMW, PSA and Volvo Cars. Once in active deployment, other telematic services such as route advisories and traffic information are expected to explode.|$|R
50|$|Interference {{tends to}} be more {{troublesome}} with older radio technologies such as analogue amplitude modulation, which have no way of distinguishing unwanted <b>in-band</b> <b>signals</b> from the intended signal, and the omnidirectional antennas used with broadcast systems.Newer radio systems incorporate several improvements that enhance the selectivity.In digital radio systems, such as Wi-Fi, error-correction techniques can be used. Spread-spectrum and frequency-hopping techniques can be used with both analogue and digital signalling to improve resistance to interference.A highly directional receiver, such as a parabolic antenna or a diversity receiver, can be used to select one signal in space to the exclusion of others.|$|R
