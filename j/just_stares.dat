5000|$|In most of {{the film}} adaptations of Devdas, the story of Chandramukhi {{is similar to the}} novel. However, in {{most of the}} films her {{humanitarian}} work in helping the needy is not depicted. Unlike in the novel, a scene in which Chandramukhi and Parvathi meet was added in Bimal Roy's 1955 version when Paro, played by Suchitra Sen riding in a human rickshaw, comes across Chandramukhi, played by Vyjayanthimala, who <b>just</b> <b>stares</b> at Paro without a single word being exchanged between them. The meeting scene of Paro and Chandramukhi in the 1955 version was still {{regarded as one of the}} memorable scene in Bollywood with the background music adding the impact to the scene. In the 2002 version, the director, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, extended the interaction between Paro and Chandramukhi, also showing them dancing together to the hit song [...] "Dola Re Dola".|$|E
50|$|The Canal follows {{an unnamed}} narrator {{as he tries}} {{to make sense of the}} {{everyday}} violence around him. One morning, instead of walking to work (his usual weekday routine), he simply walks to the Regent’s canal in north east London, where he finds himself a suitable bench to sit on opposite a whitewashed office block on the other side of the murky water. He spends most of this first morning watching the commuters walking and cycling to and fro, together with the swans, coots and moorhens who have made the canal their home. He blames the onset of boredom for this sudden change in lifestyle. He is soon joined by a young woman on the same bench. She doesn’t speak, <b>just</b> <b>stares</b> ahead at the whitewashed office block, watching its occupants move from office to office and desk to desk. In this coming together begins a complicated treatise on violence, catastrophe, secrets, death, aviation, weight, technology and gravity, as this mysterious woman leads the narrator into a dark world of obsession and brutality.|$|E

Loomis suggests that his patient be confined in a maximum-security ward located at Litchfield, Illinois. The doctors dismiss Loomis' request declaring that Michael was merely [...] "a catatonic" [...] exhibiting [...] "comatose behavior" [...] who does not react to any of his surroundings. Loomis insists that his patient's blank behavior is an ingenious cover for his true nature. He also feels {{that the level of}} security at Smith's Grove is insufficient. He pleads that Michael be moved immediately to a maximum security facility and preclude him any future opportunity for legalized freedom. The Smith's Grove superiors still decline his requests and issue an ultimatum that Loomis keep Michael as his patient or he will be looked after by someone else. Loomis knows that no one else can be trusted or even be safe around Michael, so he agrees. He then goes to Michael's room and chides him, saying that Michael may have the Smith's Grove staff deceived, but he will never fool him; Michael <b>just</b> <b>stares</b> blankly at the window.|$|E

The duo smile at each other and then a series of motorbikes go past, but the drivers stop to let Ant & Dec on the passenger seat of one bike each, in order to ride them to the Saturday Night Takeaway studio. They ride past a large billboard with that week's guest announcer/guest performer(s), who wave(s) to them and Ant & Dec wave back. After the motorbikes pass over the Tower Bridge, Ant & Dec get off and wave goodbye to the riders. They run halfway down a set of stairs which are lit up, and meet six attractive female dancers - three on the left next to Ant and three on the right next to Dec. Dec has a quick dance but Ant <b>just</b> <b>stares</b> at them and laughs. He pulls Dec away and they run down the rest of the stairs. The scene then cuts to them arriving at The London Studios. They run inside and the camera shoots up to the roof area, where the show's logo appears.|$|E

The music video, which was {{directed}} by Randee St. Nicholas, premiered on CMT and GAC on August 18, 2010. It begins with Reba, {{dressed in a black}} hooded cloak and sunglasses, about to go into a warehouse, when train track arms come down and traffic stops. When inside the warehouse, after walking down a hallway with hanging, swinging light fixtures, she takes off her cloak and glasses, and finds a stack of radios on a metal cart. She then uses a box-cutter to open boxes that contain more radios. After putting these radios on the cart, she finds her cheating ex, sitting in a chair and looking blank. She appears to sing the kiss-off lyrics directly to him, but he <b>just</b> <b>stares</b> into space the whole time. As the instrumental bridge kicks in, she turns up the volume to maximum on every radio on the cart. Then, she ties her ex up with the microphone cord she was using to sing. She then puts back on her cloak and sunglasses and leaves. Before she gets into her car, she texts her ex, and the video ends with him finally taking his iPhone out, hitting the reply button, and seeing multiple texts from Reba saying [...] "Turn on the RADIO!!!", implying that she and him are no more.|$|E

[...] A Medium arrives and {{explains that the}} spirit of the Husband entered her during a seance. She summons his spirit again ("The Medium and The Husband's Statement"). The Husband's story is that his wife became enraptured with the Thief and turned on the husband ("You'll Go Away With Me" [...] (Reprise)). The rape becomes passionate love-making, and the Husband attempts to block it out of his mind by recalling that the marquee of the movie house screening Rashomon was missing the [...] "a" [...] in the title.

He decides that the honorable thing to do would be to kill himself ("Simple as This"). The Medium and the Husband perform an elaborate ritual reminiscent of traditional Japanese Seppuku (stomach-cutting). His last memory is of [...] "someone" [...] removing the stiletto from his abdomen and his blood flowing into the grass.|$|E
