5|$|Some Anglo-Saxon kings {{are known}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> their {{households}} or in open warfare against rivals, but overall the record is very sparse. The evidence as regards the deposition of kings is equally limited. Only two eighth-century depositions offer any context, those of Æthelwald Moll in Northumbria and Sigeberht of Wessex. In both cases the decision is presented as that of some form of council.|$|E
5|$|At 80years of age, Buckner memorized five of Shakespeare's plays because {{cataracts}} {{threatened to}} blind him, but an operation saved his sight. On {{a visit to}} the White House in 1904, Buckner asked President Theodore Roosevelt to appoint his only son as a cadet at West Point, and Roosevelt quickly agreed. His son would later serve in the U.S. Army and be killed at the Battle of Okinawa, making him the highest-ranking American to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> enemy fire during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Consensus has {{determined}} sea turtles, including E. imbricata to be, {{at the very}} least, threatened species because of their slow growth and maturity, and slow reproductive rates. Many adult turtles <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> humans, both accidentally and deliberately. Their existence is threatened due to pollution and loss of nesting areas because of coastal development. Biologist guess that the hawkbill population has declined 80 {{percent in the past}} hundred years. Human and animal encroachment threatens nesting sites, and small mammals dig up the eggs to eat. In the US Virgin Islands, mongooses raid hawksbill nests (along with those of other sea turtles, such as Dermochelys coriacea) right after they are laid.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this discovery, Kate locks herself in her crime lab and tries {{to come to terms}} with what just happened, while the police struggle in vain to find any sign of Alice's corpse. These scenes are depicted amongst numerous flashback sequences that comprise most of the issue. Throughout them, back story is provided from her childhood that depicts Kate, her twin sister Beth, and their mother being kidnapped. While Kate's father is able to rescue her, it appears as though both her sister and mother <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> the time he arrives.|$|E
5|$|Statistics on lynchings {{began to}} be {{collected}} in 1882. Since that time, more than 500 African Americans <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> extrajudicial violence in Mississippi alone, and more than 3,000 across the South. Most of the incidents took place between 1876 and 1930; though far less common by the mid-1950s, these racially motivated murders still occurred. Throughout the South, whites publicly prohibited interracial relationships {{as a means to}} maintain white supremacy. Even the suggestion of sexual contact between black men and white women could carry severe penalties for black men. A resurgence of the enforcement of such Jim Crow mores was evident following World War II, when African-American veterans started pressing for equal rights in the South.|$|E
5|$|The Ipswich serial murders {{took place}} between 30 October and 10 December 2006, during which time the bodies of five murdered women were {{discovered}} at different locations near Ipswich, Suffolk, England.

Two of the victims, Anneli Alderton and Paula Clennell, were confirmed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> asphyxiation. A cause of death for the other victims, Gemma Adams, Tania Nicol and Annette Nicholls, was not established.|$|E

5|$|Tomlinson then {{attempted}} to assist Mohamed al-Fayed in his privately funded {{investigation into the}} death of Diana, Princess of Wales and al-Fayed's son Dodi. Tomlinson claimed that MI6 had considered assassinating Slobodan Milošević, the president of Serbia, by staging a car crash using a powerful strobe light to blind the driver. He suggested that Diana and Dodi may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> MI6 in the same way, although that claim was dismissed at their inquest in 2007. MI6 admitted that plans of that nature had been drafted regarding a different Eastern European official, but that the proposal had been swiftly rejected by management.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Dare: The {{daughter}} of Ananias Dare, {{and the first}} English child born in the Americas. In this world, the Roanoke Colony did not disappear in the 1580s; when Steve Rogers went into this world he saved the colony, which would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> starvation. Dare touches the rift caused by Roger's arrival. She {{has the ability to}} transform into white-furred animals when frightened, which she later learns to control, and appears to be the equivalent to Alpha Flight's Snowbird who has a similar appearance and powers, though Neil Gaiman had denied this.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains from Hurricane Beta, amounting up to 6.39in (162mm), {{and strong}} winds caused {{extensive}} property damage in Nicaragua. Six people were confirmed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> Beta in Nicaragua, {{one of which}} was caused by a heart attack. It was initially feared that ten others, who were listed as missing, were killed when their vessel disappeared during the storm. But they were later rescued by a Panamanian vessel after drifting in the waters for several hours. Throughout the country, a total of 376 latrines, 215 homes, two schools, two community children centres, two community water tanks and five solar panels were destroyed. An additional 852 homes, 21 schools, and three health centres were damaged. The cost to repair damages caused by the hurricane were estimated at $2.1million (2006USD). A total of 2,668 people were left homeless {{as a result of the}} storm.|$|E

5|$|In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, {{described}} {{an outbreak of}} typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters. The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. A causal link between the bivalves and the illness {{was not easy to}} demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One viral pathogen is the Norwalk virus. This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may be present in the marine environment even when coliform bacteria <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> the treatment of sewage.|$|E
5|$|Predation in {{the wild}} appears to be very rare for ruffed lemurs, {{probably}} because living in the high canopy makes them challenging to catch. Evidence of predation by raptors, such as the Henst's goshawk (Accipiter henstii) suggests it occurs at a low rate. The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) could present a potential risk if it found an individual lower in the forest canopy, but no confirmation has been presented to indicate that they prey upon ruffed lemurs. Instead, only re-introduced, captive-bred ruffed lemurs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> fossa, likely due to their inexperience with predators. Nesting behavior poses the biggest risk of predation, making them susceptible to carnivorous mammals, such as the ring-tailed mongoose (Galidia elegans) and brown-tailed mongoose (Salanoia concolor).|$|E
5|$|The {{demands of}} {{managing}} the ranch consume all of Chetwin's time, leaving Wilton to feel neglected and unloved. One day, a traveler is injured near the ranch, whom she recognizes as Pelham. Pelham courts her, taking advantage of her loneliness. Although she admits she does not love him, he convinces her to abandon her family and run away with him. As she is preparing to depart, she is confronted by Starlight, an Indian woman {{who works as a}} servant on the ranch, who reminds Wilton of the needs of her child. She spurns Pelham and returns to her family. Eventually, Chetwin forgives her and devotes more of his time to her. Pelham may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> Starlight, although his ultimate fate is left unclear.|$|E
