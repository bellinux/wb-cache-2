50|$|On {{the death}} of Thomas Thornes his widow {{retained}} possession of Shelvock, and married George Bold, but their right to the property was evidently disputed by the family, for in 1699 a deed of family settlement was executed, dated October 30, between them and several other relatives. By this deed {{it was agreed that}} all differences and lawsuits about the land and estate of the late Francis and Thomas Thornes were to cease. The Bolds were to hold for their lives and to keep in repair the capital messuage of Shelvock, the Heath Mill, and the demesne lands belonging to Shelvock, and several properties in Shotatton which were parcel of the demesne lands of Shelvock. After the deaths of the Bolds, the whole of the above were to belong in fee simple, <b>free</b> <b>from</b> <b>encumbrances,</b> to Francis Thornes' four daughters and their representatives. Anne Bold, therefore, and her second husband, George Bold, had possession of Shelvock from 1678; and they were still alive in 1707, but had to let it to some under-tenants.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{looks at the}} legal status of post-German {{property}} in Poland {{in the light of the}} bill on monetary benefit for certain persons affected by nationalisation processes, and analyses international law acts under which Poland acquired that property. Special attention has been given to the Treaty of Potsdam of 2 August 1945 and the Polish-Soviet agreement of 16 August 1945 which regulated the manner of reparations for war damages caused by Nazi occupation in Poland. The provisions of those two documents and resulting from them status quo were later confirmed by subsequent acts of international law. The territorial cession endorsed by the UK, the USA and the USSR in Potsdam, resulted in Poland receiving a portion of East Prussia, in consequence of which post-German property, <b>free</b> <b>from</b> <b>encumbrances,</b> has become property of the State Treasury. It is claimed in the paper that the Treaty of Potsdam should be recognised as pactum in favorem tertii. The Polish-Soviet agreement on German reparations should also be considered as a direct legal instrument of international application concerning the execution of constitutive provisions of the Treaty, in which {{the legal status of}} former German property was unambiguously defined...|$|E

The cabins were lined with satin-wood and bird's-eye maple; small marble columns separated the glittering panels of polished wood, and rich carpets covered the floors. The main cabin had the great table, as a fixture, in the centre, but that of Eve, somewhat shorter, but of equal width, was <b>free</b> <b>from</b> all <b>encumbrance</b> of the sort.

2500|$|Given {{the strangeness}} of the concept, some historians have doubted {{the reality of the}} {{exchange}} of goods and suggested that the exchange was really a transfer of the liturgy itself.

40|$|Summary]: Each {{state and}} {{territory}} within Australia adopted the Torrens system of land title registration whereby a principal {{feature of the}} Torrens system {{is the notion of}} an indefeasible title affording protection to registrable interests by the act of a registered proprietor holding the land absolutely <b>free</b> <b>from</b> all <b>encumbrances</b> except those noted on the register. There are a number of exceptions, one of which is not usually recognised - the loss of legal title through an application for possessory title by adverse possession. Adverse possession can be legislated as either a whole parcel or a part-parcel application. Within all states in Australia problem survey areas exist where the accuracy of modern measurment techniques when applied over surveys completed pre-electronic distance measurement will raise the issue of reinstatement by mathematical solution versus occupation based upon earlier surveys. A problem survey can exist where mathematical solutions and occupation vary greatly. This paper examines the application of part-parcel adverse possession as a means to resolve problem survey areas where agreement between land owners {{is not likely to be}} achieved where land readjustment between adjoining owners is desirable to maintain an accurate cadastre...|$|R

Here the river is about two miles wide; and the shores on either side being low, it has all the appearance of an extensive lake.

5000|$|Vers libre is {{a poetic}} form of flexibility, {{complexity}} and naturalness {{created in the}} late 19th century in France, in 1886, largely through the activities of La Vogue, a weekly journal founded by Gustave Kahn, {{and the appearance of}} a band of poets unequalled at any one {{time in the history of}} French poetry, the ‘Counter-Romanticism’ led by Baudelaire, Verlaine, Rimbaud, Mallarmé, Laforgue, Corbière, concerned with synaethesis (the harmony or equilibrium of sensation) later described as ‘the moment when French poetry began to take consciousness of itself as poetry’. Gustave Kahn was commonly supposed to have invented the term Vers libre and according to F. S. Flint 'was undoubtedly the first theorist of the techniques'. Later in 1912, Robert de Souza published his conclusion on the genre 'that a vers libre was possible which would keep all the essential characteristics of vers classique, but would <b>free</b> it <b>from</b> the <b>encumbrances</b> which usage had made appear indispensable'. Thus the practice of verse libre was not the abandoning of pattern, but the creation of an original and complicated metrical form for each poem.|$|R
