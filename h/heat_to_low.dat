Depending on the surface condition, heating temperature and pre-straining, different patterns of micro/nano-scaled wrinkles are produced.

40|$|In Sweden, {{the energy}} usage in {{existing}} residential buildings amounted to 147 TWh in 2012, equivalent to almost 40 % {{of the final}} overall national energy usage. Among all the end users in building service sectors, 60 % of the final energy in Sweden is used for space heating and domestic hot water (DHW) production in 2013. In {{order to reduce the}} supply temperature for space heating in existing buildings, combined approaches are favorably adopted: to reduce the net energy demand by air-tightness and insulation retrofits; and renovate the conventional high temperature <b>heating</b> <b>to</b> <b>low</b> temperature <b>heating</b> (LTH) systems. As an energy-efficiency alternative, LTH technology has shown promising advantages and shortcuts to improve the coefficient of performance (COP) of heat pump system, which further saves primary energy. However, existing modeling achievements and field testing reveal that the attained application of LTH has a relatively high requirement to the air-tightness in new constructed single-family houses. Moreover, in some leaky multi-family building stock with low envelope surface temperature, LTH may have limited energy saving potentials. How to evaluate the impact of air-tightness for the LTH implementation and energy saving potentials in existing houses are not sufficiently attained so far. This paper presents a modeling approach combining LTH simulation with air-tightness evaluation, aimed to estimate whether the selected existing building types can cope with LTH with upgraded primary energy savings. In addition, the impact of air-tightness retrofits for LTH implementation in selected Swedish residential buildings is of interests. In the simulation Consoli Retro are employed to simulate the energy performance. It is revealed that the combined effect of floor heating/ ventilation radiators and air-tightness retrofits to 1 / 1. 5 ACH can contribute 19 % to 36 % primary energy savings in total. However, different LTH systems and archetypes have varies sensitivities to air-tightness retrofits. Benchmark the impact of air-tightness to different LTH systems needs further investigations among other archetypes and on-site measures for future application of LTH on a larger scope.

40|$|An {{effective}} {{response to}} stress is {{of paramount importance}} for probiotic bifidobacteria administered in foods, since it determines their performance as beneficial microorganisms. Firstly, bifidobacteria have to be resistant to the stress sources typical in manufacturing, including <b>heating,</b> exposure <b>to</b> <b>low</b> water activities, osmotic shock and presence of oxygen. Secondly, and once they are orally ingested, bifidobacteria have to overcome physiological barriers in order to arrive in the large intestine biologically active. These barriers are mainly the acid pH in the stomach and the presence of high bile salt concentrations in the small intestine. In addition, the large intestine is, in terms of microbial amounts, a densely populated environment in which there is an extreme variability in carbon source availability. For this reason, bifidobacteria harbours a wide molecular machinery allowing the degradation {{of a wide variety of}} otherwise non-digestible sugars.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{jet fuel}} with a - 33 C freezing point was chilled in a wing tank simulator with superimposed fuel <b>heating</b> <b>to</b> improve <b>low</b> temperature flowability. Heating consisted of circulating {{a portion of}} the fuel <b>to</b> an external <b>heat</b> exchanger and returning the <b>heated</b> fuel <b>to</b> the tank. Flowability was determined by the mass percent of unpumpable fuel (holdup) left in the simulator upon withdrawal of fuel at the conclusion of testing. The study demonstrated that fuel heating is feasible and improves flowability as compared to that of baseline, unheated tests. Delayed heating with initiation when the fuel reaches a prescribed low temperature limit, showed promise of being more efficient than continuous heating. Regardless of the mode or rate of heating, complete flowability (zero holdup) could not be restored by fuel heating.

Reports of Bacillus cereus outbreaks in Europe (including very severe emetic outbreaks) markedly increased in recent years. Spores of B. cereus are widely dispersed in the environment and contaminate any sort of foods. With Clostridium botulinum and C. perfringens, B. cereus is a concern for mildly heat-processed foods because of spore resistance and many strains have the ability to multiply at refrigeration temperature. The phenotypic diversity of Bacillus cereus strains has been established long ago. Recently a robust description of the genetic structure of the whole group has been provided and defined seven genetic groups. With respect to food safety, these groups numbered I-VII have different growth temperature profiles, and also differ by their involvement in foodborne poisoning incidents, production of toxins causing poisonings, resistance <b>to</b> <b>heat,</b> adaptation <b>to</b> <b>low</b> pH or <b>to</b> <b>low</b> aw, etc… For instance most cereulide-producing strains are distributed in phylogenetic group III that also contains the most heat-resistant strains.
