5000|$|In January 1938, Marion Stubbs Thomas {{organized}} {{a group of}} twenty-one mothers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania {{with the idea of}} establishing a social and cultural union for their children. From the beginning, this new club, Jack and Jill, focused on instilling values and leadership skills in their children and providing [...] "all the opportunities possible for a normal and graceful approach to a beautiful adulthood." [...] This group in Philadelphia quickly inspired others to found similar organizations. The second [...] "chapter" [...] of Jack and Jill was established in New York City in 1939, and a third in Washington, D.C. in 1940. The local group became an inter-city association, expanding to Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Maryland, Boston, Buffalo, New York, Columbus, Ohio, Durham, North Carolina and Memphis, Tennessee between 1944 and June 1, 1946 -- the birth date of the national organization. Headquartered in Washington, <b>D.C.,</b> <b>Jack</b> and Jill of America, Inc. is divided into seven geographic regions for administrative purposes. Each region has a Director, Treasurer, Secretary and Foundation Member-at-Large, and is represented on a National Executive Board. At present, there are more than 230 Jack and Jill chapters in 35 states across the United States, with more than 10,000 mother members and 40,000 parents and children.|$|E
5000|$|In 1996, Nintendo {{released}} the Game Boy Pocket: a smaller, lighter unit that required fewer batteries. It has space for two AAA batteries, which provide approximately 10 hours of game play. The unit is also {{fitted with a}} 3 volt, 2.35mm x 0.75mm <b>DC</b> <b>jack</b> {{which can be used}} to power the system. The Pocket has a smaller link port, which requires an adapter to link with the older Game Boy. The port design is used on all subsequent Game Boy models, excluding the Game Boy Micro. The screen was changed to a true black-and-white display, rather than the [...] "pea soup" [...] monochromatic display of the original Game Boy. Also, the Game Boy Pocket (GBP) has a larger screen than the Game Boy Color (GBC) that later superseded it. The GBP's screen has a 65 mm diagonal, 48.5 mm width, and 43.5 mm height, compared to a 59 mm diagonal for the GBC. Although, like its predecessor, the Game Boy Pocket has no backlight to allow play in a darkened area, it did notably improve visibility and pixel response-time (mostly eliminating ghosting). The first version did not have a power LED. This was soon added due to public demand, along with new Game Boy Pocket units of different colors (released on April 28, 1997), some of them new to the Game Boy line. There were several limited-edition Game Boy Pockets including a metallic Ice Blue unit and a pink model exclusive to Japan. The Game Boy Pocket was not a new software platform and played the same software as the original Game Boy model.|$|E

40|$|A flow {{injection}} {{method was}} developed, {{aimed at the}} determination of urea in human serum. The system makes use of the naturally immobilized urease present in Canavalia ensiformis <b>DC</b> (<b>jack</b> bean). A column is filled with small pieces of this bean, and the sample (50 microliters) containing urea passes through it carried by a 1 % NaCl solution. On leaving the column the stream is merged with an alkaline reagent (0. 5 mol dm- 3 NaOH; 0. 5 % disodium dihydrogen ethylenediaminetetraacetate). The ammonium ions, arising from the enzymatic reaction that occurs inside the column, are changed into the molecular form, which permeates a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane and is received in a de-ionized water acceptor stream. The ammonia ionizes causing {{an increase in the}} conductance, which is proportional to the urea content of the sample. About 40 samples can be processed in 1 h with negligible carry-over and with a relative standard deviation of 1 % or less. The results are in agreement with those obtained by a standard spectrophotometric method...|$|E

50|$|The {{books were}} short picture books, {{illustrated}} by Angela Mills and written by {{her and her}} then husband Pat Mills. Some of the later books were written by other writers such as Greta Landen and Elisabeth Sackett.

It changes pitch and tempo, instead of just changing pitch, so it produces a similar effect to tape recorder.|$|R
5000|$|The Challengers of the Unknown is {{a quartet}} of science fiction adventurers created by Jack Kirby. They debuted in 1957, and their {{commercial}} success spawned two other science fiction characters: Cave Carson and Rip Hunter.

50|$|In December 2004, Z.Vex {{released}} {{a new model}} of the Fuzz Factory, called the Vexter Series Fuzz Factory. The Vexter series differs from the Handpainted version in that it has a silkscreened enclosure and a shorter warranty period. This effectively lowers the price point, and makes both production easier for Z.Vex and allows the effect to become more accessible to musicians. The Vexter Fuzz Factory contains the same circuit as the original Fuzz Factory pedals, with the inclusion of modern touches such as an indicator LED and <b>DC</b> power <b>jack</b> for powering the fuzz with an adapter. As of August 2006, Vexter series Z.Vex pedal subassemblies are completed in Taiwan, but a large portion is still done in Minnesota.|$|R

50|$|While {{sales of}} the title were modest, Brother Power was not popular among the staff. Former DC Comics Editorial Director Carmine Infantino claimed in several {{interviews}} following his retirement from comics that Superman editor Mort Weisinger disliked the character very strongly, and petitioned <b>DC</b> publisher <b>Jack</b> Liebowitz {{to shut down the}} title. According to Infantino, Weisinger harbored an admitted dislike for the hippie subculture of the 1960s, and felt that Simon portrayed them too sympathetically. It did not help that Hound Dawg and his cronies appeared with uniforms and gadgetry evocative of Nazis in the second issue. According to Joe Simon, the third issue was canceled just before the finished artwork was to be set up for print duplication, and Simon would neither discuss the plot of this issue nor release any of the original art.|$|R
