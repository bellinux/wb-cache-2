25|$|Czech: á, é, <b>í,</b> <b>ó,</b> <b>ú,</b> ý are {{the long}} {{versions}} of a, e, <b>i,</b> <b>o,</b> <b>u,</b> y. The accent {{is known as}} čárka. To indicate a long u in the middle or {{at the end of}} a word, a kroužek (ring) is used instead, to form ů.|$|E
5000|$|In Igbo, an underdot {{can be used}} on <b>i,</b> <b>o,</b> and <b>u</b> to make <b>ị,</b> <b>ọ,</b> and <b>ụ.</b> The underdot symbolizes a {{reduction}} in the vowel height.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} grave accents (à, è, <b>ì,</b> <b>ò</b> and <b>ù)</b> and {{circumflex}} accents (â, ê, <b>î,</b> <b>ô,</b> and <b>û),</b> which are put above the vowels {{to distinguish between}} homophonic words or to show stress (the former) and show long vowels (the latter).|$|R

5000|$|Inverted breve or arch is a diacritical mark, {{shaped like}} {{the top half}} of a circle ( [...] &#785; [...] ), that is, like an {{upside-down}} breve (˘). It looks similar to the circumflex (&#710;), but the circumflex has a sharp tip; the inverted breve is rounded: compare Â â Ê ê <b>Î</b> <b>î</b> <b>Ô</b> <b>ô</b> <b>Û</b> û (circumflex) versus Ȃ ȃ Ȇ ȇ <b>Ȋ</b> <b>ȋ</b> <b>Ȏ</b> <b>ȏ</b> <b>Ȗ</b> ȗ (inverted breve).|$|R

25|$|In Spanish, the {{grapheme}} ñ {{is considered}} a new letter different from n and collated between n and o, as it denotes a different sound {{from that of a}} plain n. But the accented vowels á, é, <b>í,</b> <b>ó,</b> <b>ú</b> are not separated from the unaccented vowels a, e, <b>i,</b> <b>o,</b> <b>u,</b> as the acute accent in Spanish only modifies stress within the word or denotes a distinction between homonyms, and does not modify the sound of a letter.|$|E
50|$|Of these 29 letters, eight are vowels (A, E, <b>I,</b> <b>İ,</b> <b>O,</b> <b>Ö,</b> <b>U,</b> Ü); {{the other}} 21 are consonants.|$|R

25|$|The acute accent (á, é, <b>í,</b> <b>ó,</b> <b>ú)</b> or {{circumflex}} accent (â, ê, <b>î,</b> <b>ô,</b> <b>û,</b> ŷ) marks long vowels in the Elvish languages. When writing Common Eldarin forms, Tolkien {{often used}} the macron to indicate long vowels. The diaeresis (ä, ë, ö) is normally used {{to show that}} a short vowel is to be separately pronounced, that it is not silent or part of a diphthong. For example, the last four letters of Ainulindalë represent two syllables, rather than the English word dale, and the first three letters of Eärendil represent two syllables rather than the English word ear.|$|E
25|$|Slovak: {{the acute}} accent is called dĺžeň in Slovak. In {{addition}} to the long vowels á, é, <b>í,</b> <b>ó,</b> <b>ú</b> and ý, dĺžeň is used to mark two syllabic consonants ŕ and ĺ, which are the long counterparts of syllabic r and l.|$|E
