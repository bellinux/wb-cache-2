5000|$|Daniel Dennett devotes {{the longest}} chapter in Darwin's Dangerous Idea to an excoriating {{caricature}} of my ideas, all {{in order to}} bolster his defense of Darwinian fundamentalism. If an argued case can be discerned at all amid the slurs and sneers, {{it would have to}} be described as an effort to claim that I have, thanks to some literary skill, tried to raise a few piddling, insignificant, and basically conventional ideas to [...] "revolutionary" [...] status, challenging what he takes to be the true Darwinian scripture. Since Dennett shows so little understanding of evolutionary theory beyond natural selection, his critique of my work amounts to little more than sniping at false targets of his own construction. He never deals with my ideas as such, but proceeds by hint, <b>innuendo,</b> <b>false</b> attribution, and error.|$|R

5000|$|In 1950, Rosinger's {{criticism}} of Chiang Kai-shek {{and support for}} decolonizing South and Southeast Asia ran him afoul of Congressional loyalty committees. He edited a survey of Asian politics, called [...] "The State of Asia" [...] (1950), which attempted to synthesize Asia's political tumult between 1945 and its publication in 1950. Rosinger's contributions to the volume were criticized for being too sympathetic to the Chinese Communist cause. Yale University's Richard L. Walker, in a review for the New York Times, remarked on the volume's [...] "high standards" [...] but warned that [...] "Mr. Rosinger uses loose terminology, presentation of <b>false</b> alternatives, and <b>innuendo</b> to present a one-sided picture of the Chinese Communist Regime." ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{a person}} who prized {{anonymity}} and once stated that his hobby was [...] "obscurity," [...] Forrestal and his policies had been the constant target of vicious personal attacks from columnists, including Drew Pearson and Walter Winchell. Pearson's protégé, Jack Anderson, later asserted that Pearson [...] "hectored Forrestal with <b>innuendos</b> and <b>false</b> accusations." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{subcommittee}} first investigated {{allegations of}} Communist {{influence in the}} Voice of America, at that time administered by the State Department's United States Information Agency. Many VOA personnel were questioned in front of television cameras and a packed press gallery, with McCarthy lacing his questions with hostile <b>innuendo</b> and <b>false</b> accusations. A few VOA employees alleged Communist influence {{on the content of}} broadcasts, but none of the charges were substantiated. Morale at VOA was badly damaged, and one of its engineers committed suicide during McCarthy's investigation. Ed Kretzman, a policy advisor for the service, would later comment that it was VOA's [...] "darkest hour when Senator McCarthy and his chief hatchet man, Roy Cohn, almost succeeded in muffling it." ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} curious aspects of the 2004 presidential {{election}} was the strength and resilience of the belief among many Americans that Saddam Hussein {{was linked to the}} terrorist attacks of September 11. Scholars have suggested that this belief {{was the result of a}} campaign of <b>false</b> information and <b>innuendo</b> from the Bush administration. We call this the information environment explanation. Using a technique of “challenge interviews ” on a sample of voters who reported believing in a link between Saddam and 9 / 11, we propose instead a social psychological explanation for the belief in this link. We identify a number of social psychological mechanisms voters use to maintain false beliefs in the face of disconfirming information, and we show that for a subset of voters the main reason to believe in the link was that it made sense of the administration’s decision to go to war against Iraq. We call this inferred justification: for these voters, the fact of the war led to a search for a justification for it, which led them to infer the existence of ties between Iraq and 9 / 11. Ronald Reagan once remarked that “the trouble with our liberal friends is not that they are ignorant, but that they know so much that isn’t so ” (Reaga...|$|R

If that spirit of {{destruction}} cannot stop him by magic, or war and devastation, {{then it will}} try to crush the young Maker by simpler means - more human means. By lies and <b>innuendo,</b> and by <b>false</b> accusations, Alvin is driven from his home back to Hatrack River, {{only to find that}} the Unmaker has been there before him, and that he must now stand trial for his life. Against him in this trial stands Daniel Webster.|$|R
2500|$|Allegations {{of cocaine}} use and sex with male teenage congressional pages by unnamed congressmen were pursued by {{investigators}} and journalists in 1982.

5000|$|Comedy Central was {{prohibited}} from broadcasting in India for 10 days, from 00:01 hours on 25 May till 00:01 hours on 4 June 2012, after an inter-ministerial committee (IMC) {{set up by}} the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting found that two of its shows that aired in 2012, carried [...] "obscene dialogues and vulgar words" [...] that [...] "offend good taste", violating several provisions of the Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994. The provisions of the law include [...] "no programme should be carried in the cable service which offends against good taste or decency; no programme should be carried which contains anything obscene, defamatory, deliberate, <b>false</b> and suggestive <b>innuendos</b> and half truths". It also states that [...] "no programme should be carried which denigrates women through the depiction in any manner of the figure of woman, her form or body or any part thereof {{in such a way as}} to have the effect of being indecent or derogatory to women or is likely to injure the public morality". The incidents in question involved an episode of Stand Up Club where an unnamed stand-up performed an act with [...] "obscene dialogues and vulgar words derogatory to women" [...] aired on 26 May 2012, and an episode of the French hidden camera prank show PopCorn TV aired on 4 July 2012, where one of the crew members was shown standing opposite a wall, in a shop holding a pair of fake legs against his thighs in his hands and making suggestive movements similar to having sex. Comedy Central apologised for the broadcast, blaming it on an [...] "unintentional genuine error".|$|R
2500|$|During the {{leadership}} election, Nick Clegg registered a formal complaint about Huhne's conduct to Chris Rennard, the party's Chief Whip and returning officer. Clegg stated that his rival was indulging in: [...] "the politics of <b>innuendo,</b> mounting <b>false</b> challenges {{and running a}} campaign that is handing political ammunition to the party's political opponents." [...] Huhne and Clegg were debating on live television on BBC's The Politics Show on Sunday 18 November 2007, when presenter Jon Sopel produced a briefing document that had been specially delivered to the show's production team by the Huhne campaign team on the preceding Friday. The document excoriated Clegg {{on a number of}} policy and political issues and was titled [...] "Calamity Clegg". When challenged about the document, Huhne claimed that he had no knowledge of it and said he did not agree with the document title but agreed with the points within it. Asked how it was possible that he had no knowledge of such a major document sent to the producer of the show he was due to appear on, Huhne replied: [...] "It's quite impossible to check everything that goes out of the office... But I can assure you that's not had my authorization." [...] After Clegg complained about what he called [...] "dirty tricks" [...] and other senior party members condemned the Huhne campaign attack, Huhne's campaign manager Anna Werrin claimed that the title of the memo was just the product of an [...] "over-zealous researcher" [...] and had not been seen or approved by Huhne or any senior campaign officials prior to release. [...] "The document title had not been approved before the document was sent out and neither Chris nor I were aware of it." ...|$|R
