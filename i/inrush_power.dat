30|$|Water inrush {{from coal}} seam floor {{is one of}} the main {{problems}} for coal industry sustainable development in North China coalfields, which is more and more serious with the increase of mining depth. In the study of water inrush mechanism, scholars have carried out a lot of research work and proposed water inrush theory and criteria such as water inrush coefficient method (Peng et al. 2003), water inrush critical index method, “lower three zone” theory (Li 1999), in situ tensile and zero failure theory (Wang et al. 1994), board model theory (Zhang and Wang 2006), key strata theory (Qian et al. 1996), mutation and nonlinear model (Yang et al. 2001, 2005), water inrush advantage theory, water <b>inrush</b> <b>power</b> information theory, strong seepage theory (Ye and Liu 2005), similar theory, rock-water stress theory and so on, and formed water inrush prevention and control methods such as waterproof coal pillar mining (Jiang et al. 2008), double down (Miao et al. 2008, 2009), bottom grouting etc. Some scholars studied the change of rock permeability in the process of rock deformation and failure through rock stress and permeability coupling experiment (Oda et al. 2002; Noiriel et al. 2010; Watanabe et al. 2011). At present, these research results play a positive role in guiding the control of water inrush from coal seam floor. But there are some obvious weaknesses such as studying the rock and water separately or directly considering the confined water pressure to be hydrostatic pressure to floor, ignoring the interaction between seepage field and stress field. The essence of floor water inrush is the result of the interaction between seepage field and stress field and will lead to the extension and transfixion of the crack, which has been ignored. Scholars both at home and abroad have been doing extensive and in-depth research for the evolution rules of stress, strain and permeability in the process of rock seepage experiment. Some articles have presented the rock coupling seepage rule through experiments (Zheng et al. 1999; Zhu and Liu 2002) and summed up the empirical formula between rock permeability characteristics and effective stress. But there are few literatures overall considering the main permeability influence factors, the crack extension rule and the ultimate destruction form.|$|E
40|$|A new {{scheme to}} {{classify}} between internal fault current and <b>inrush</b> current of <b>power</b> transformer {{is presented in}} this paper conventionally this paper presents a novel technique for three phase transformer protection, which the method effectively identify Magnetizing inrush currents from internal fault currents.

In this paper, by extract these features, a new criterion is proposed to discriminate inrush currents from internal faults in power transformers. In faulty time such as switching or short circuit, the value of negative sequence for differential current is different from positive sequence value. Helping this feature, new criterion is introduced. Simulations show this criterion works properly in over-flux and CT saturation condition too.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} for power transformer differential protection {{which is based on}} the wave-shape recognition technique. An algorithm based on neural network principal component analysis (NNPCA) with back-propagation learning is proposed for digital differential protection of power transformer. The principal component analysis is used to preprocess the data from power system in order to eliminate redundant information and enhance hidden pattern of differential current to discriminate between internal faults from inrush and overexcitation conditions. This algorithm has been developed by considering optimal number of neurons in hidden layer and optimal number of neurons at output layer. The proposed algorithm makes use of ratio of voltage to frequency and amplitude of differential current for transformer operating condition detection.

However, a large inrush current and dy-namic IR drop may occur when a circuit domain is powered up with MTCMOS switches. This could in turn lead to improper cir-cuit operation. We propose a novel framework for generating a proper power-up sequence of the switches to control the inrush cur-rent of a power-gated domain while minimizing the power-up time and reducing the dynamic IR drop of the active domains. We also propose a configurable domino-delay circuit for implementing the sequence. Experimental results based on state-of-the-art industrial designs demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed framework in limiting the inrush current, minimizing the power-up time, and reducing the dynamic IR drop.

40|$|Abstract — At {{the time}} of {{transformer}} energization, a high current will be drawn by the transformer. This current is called transient inrush current and it may rise to ten times the nominal full load current of transformer during operation. Energization transient can produce mechanical stress in the transformer causes protection system mal-function. This current often affects the power system quality and may disrupt the operation of sensitive electrical loads such as computer and medical equipment connected to the system. Reduction {{and the way to}} control energization transient currents have become important concerns to the power industry. Conventionally, controlled switching or point on wave switching was the method being used to counter the problem, but this method requires the knowledge of residual fluxes of transformer before energization, which was quite tedious to get. Hence, this paper proposes a technique to mitigate inrush current in three phase transformers which involves injecting some amount of DC flux in the primary of transformer, the process known as prefluxing. After setting the initial fluxes of the transformer it is energized by conventional controlled switching. To verify the efficientness of the proposed prefluxing method to mitigate <b>inrush</b> current for <b>power</b> transformer, a MATLAB simulation model is designed and developed. The results are verified using the sample in which transformer is connect with a supply source, which have conformed the efficient inrush current control.
