2500|$|The growing unrest over {{food safety}} in China reached a climax in early 2007, shortly after {{circulation}} to the State Council of an Asian Development Bank policy note {{based on a}} technical assistance project {{in collaboration with the}} State Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization. The note and a subsequent report applauded increased efforts by the Chinese government but noted remaining gaps, calling in particular for urgent reforms to strengthen and streamline <b>inter-agency</b> <b>coordination</b> and enact an overarching [...] "basic food law". The State Food and Drug Administration of China also published a survey in early 2007 where 65% of the respondents expressed concern about food safety. Shortly afterwards, Lu Jianzhong, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and China's Vice Premier, Wu Yi, issued statements of apology and promised to create a food safety monitoring system.|$|E

This study analyses the uncertainty in the results of space debris simulations performed using semi-stochastic models that necessitate the use of Monte Carlo simulations, which are often used by the <b>Inter-Agency</b> Debris <b>Coordination</b> Committee, amongst other studies. Statistics of the possible numbers of objects in orbit and collisions over the next 200 years are generated for the “mitigation only” scenario using a sample of 25 000 Monte Carlo runs. Bootstraps on the mean, median, variance, skewness and kurtosis of these distributions are performed. It is shown that the distribution of the objects predicted to be on-orbit becomes log-normal as collisions occur, and that Monte Carlo samples larger than traditionally used are needed to capture the debris simulation uncertainty...|$|R

30|$|To date, over 250 objects {{have broken}} up in Earth orbit (Johnson et al. 2008; Flegel et al. 2011). Breakups are {{especially}} critical whenever they occur in highly utilised orbits {{such as the}} 800 -km-altitude band or the geostationary orbit (GEO) region. A collision with an active spacecraft may not only lead to the premature termination of the satellite’s mission, but also create additional debris which in turn may collide with other objects. The process wherein debris from collisions becomes the main driver behind {{the creation of new}} debris is known as the ‘Kessler syndrome’ and may already be a reality (Kessler 1991; <b>Inter-Agency</b> Space Debris <b>Coordination</b> Committee—Working Group 2 2013).|$|R
5000|$|According to the <b>Inter-Agency</b> Space Debris <b>Coordination</b> Committee (IADC) {{the minimum}} perigee {{altitude}} [...] above the geostationary orbit is:where [...] is the solar radiation pressure coefficient (typically between 1.2 and 1.5 N/m² or Pa) and [...] is the aspect area m² to mass kg {{ratio of the}} satellite. This formula includes about 200 km for the GEO-protected zone to also permit orbit maneuvers in GEO without interference with the graveyard orbit.
