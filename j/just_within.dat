5|$|Her death caused {{reactions}} not <b>just</b> <b>within</b> Saskatchewan and the curling community, {{but also}} across the country. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien {{said in a}} statement: All Canadians have been touched by the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler. Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada. But what really set her apart was her bright, engaging personality and her incredible zest for life, qualities that were so clearly in evidence as she fought so valiantly against her illness. She will be sorely missed. In honour of Schmirler, flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.|$|E

5|$|In early December, the ITCZ spawned {{an area of}} {{convection}} {{near the}} boundary between the south-west Indian and Australian regions. On December8, the MFR estimated that a disturbance formed <b>just</b> <b>within</b> the Australian region, which entered this basin on December9. After the convection developed into a central dense overcast, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Elvina on December10. Later that day, the MFR estimated peak 10minute winds of 85km/h (50mph). On December11, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute winds of 100km/h (65mph). By that time, Elvina had been moving steadily west-southwestward, although the storm slowed on December12. A polar trough caused the storm to accelerate to the southwest on December14 while simultaneously increasing wind shear, causing weakening. On December16, Elvina dissipated well to the south of Diego Garcia.|$|E

The Molonglo River which flows across the Molonglo plain has been dammed to form the national capital's iconic feature Lake Burley Griffin. The Molonglo then flows into the Murrumbidgee north-west of Canberra, which in turn flows north-west toward the New South Wales town of Yass. The Queanbeyan River joins the Molonglo River at Oaks Estate <b>just</b> <b>within</b> the ACT.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of evolutionary biology, studies of mutation and genetic diversity in natural populations, combined with biogeography and systematics, led to sophisticated mathematical and causal models of evolution. Paleontology and comparative anatomy allowed more detailed reconstructions of the evolutionary history of life. After the rise of molecular genetics in the 1950s, the field of molecular evolution developed, based on protein sequences and immunological tests, and later incorporating RNA and DNA studies. The gene-centered view of evolution rose to prominence in the 1960s, followed by the neutral theory of molecular evolution, sparking debates over adaptationism, the unit of selection, and {{the relative importance of}} genetic drift versus natural selection as causes of evolution. In the late 20th-century, DNA sequencing led to molecular phylogenetics and the reorganization of the tree of life into the three-domain system by Carl Woese. In addition, the newly recognized factors of symbiogenesis and horizontal gene transfer introduced yet more complexity into evolutionary theory. Discoveries in evolutionary biology have made a significant impact not <b>just</b> <b>within</b> the traditional branches of biology, but also in other academic disciplines (for example: anthropology and psychology) and on society at large.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} newcomers {{represented the}} Linear Pottery culture. Their uniform culture survived in Poland {{in its original}} form until about 4600 BCE. Despite the big impact they made, the first waves came in small numbers - hundreds, or at most a few thousand people, judging by the sizes of the known settlements. They populated mainly fertile soils of southern highlands and river valleys further north, {{all the way to}} the Baltic Sea. They lived alongside the more numerous native people who were still pursuing the Mesolithic lifestyle, but during the Linear Pottery culture times there wasn't much interaction, as the two groups inhabited different environments. Their villages consisted of several, but sometimes up to a dozen or so rectangular communal long-houses, some over 30 meters long, supported by wooden posts, the oldest of which come from the Lower Silesia region. One such location from about 5000 BCE was also unearthed at Olszanica, which is now at the west end of Kraków <b>just</b> <b>within</b> the city limits.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a strengthening ridge to the south, Linfa began tracking eastward. Despite its proximity to land, the tropical storm's slow forward motion allowed for additional strengthening, {{and according to the}} JMA, Linfa reached an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90km/h (50mph) at 0000UTC on May27, <b>just</b> <b>within</b> the threshold of severe tropical storm status. Concurrently the cyclone made landfall near Dagupan, Luzon. Upon landfall, Linfa began to weaken as it crossed Luzon before emerging into the Pacific as a minimal tropical storm late that day. However, as a result of land interaction the initial surface circulation center of Linfa greatly weakened and was overtaken by a newly formed low-level circulation center on May28, resulting in the storm's position to shift well northeastward. This was the primary basis on which the JTWC downgraded Linfa to tropical depression status early on May28, though the JMA continued to analyze the system as a weak tropical storm. Afterwards, as the cyclone began to track northeastward, the new circulation center became more organized, resulting in the JTWC reclassifying Linfa as a tropical storm at 0600UTC the following day. Gradual strengthening followed, and at 1800UTC that day Linfa reached peak intensity with winds of 100km/h (65mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980mbar (hPa; 28.94inHg) south of Okinawa. Subsequently the system began to take a more northward course and undergo extratropical transition, which was completed at 0000UTC on May30. Though by this time most tropical cyclone monitoring agencies ceased the monitoring of these extratropical remnants by this time, the JMA continued to track them as they made landfall near Uwajima, Ehime at 0800UTC the following day. Linfa's remnants then paralleled the western coast of Japan before dissipating on June4 well into the Sea of Okhotsk.|$|E
5|$|The program's {{coaching}} {{extended beyond}} <b>just</b> <b>within</b> the program itself. Bowerman had his athletes mentor {{the community and}} continued to be active in the sport after his retirement. He was also a coach for the US Olympic team in 1972 and an assistant coach in 1968 US Olympic Team. Bill Dellinger coached the distance runners in the 1984 Olympic Games. After Dellinger retired from the University of Oregon, he continued to coach running on a consulting basis despite suffering through a stroke. Tom Heinonen remained a running coach after his retirement at the volunteer level for the University of Oregon Running Club. Alumnus Alberto Salazar became a noted marathon coach after his running days under the employ of Nike. Salazar used controversial coaching tactics like tweaking runners' natural running form, but had coached many athletes to the apex of their careers. He launched an experimental training program called the Oregon Project financed by Nike {{with the purpose of}} integrating African runners' training conditions into American training mixed with modern technology. He also discovered similarities in running posture between sprinters and top level distance runners, two disciplines previously thought to be exceedingly different. Instilling some of these methods into American runners, he was able to coach Kara Goucher to a third-place finish in the Boston Marathon in 2009, an event that East Africans typically dominate. Mo Farah and alumnus Galen Rupp were training partners under Salazar and finished first and second respectively in the 2012 Summer Olympics in the 10k. Rupp was the first American to medal in the 10k since Billy Mills in 1964 and the first medalist not born in Africa since 1988. Also running for Salazar and the Oregon Project, alumnus Matthew Centrowitz Jr. won a gold medal in the 2016 Summer Olympics, the first American to win gold in the 1,500m since Mel Sheppard in 1908, ending a 108 year drought. Similar to his collegiate coaches, Salazar wrote a pair of books about distance running. Matt Centrowitz, another University of Oregon alumnus and father of Matthew, took the American University track and field program to prominence since the rebirth of the program in 1999.|$|E
