5|$|By 1955, talks began about {{upgrading}} the highway. After a proposition to turn {{much of the}} route into a toll road failed, it was decided a four-lane freeway {{would be the best}} decision. However, opposition <b>from</b> <b>residents</b> in surrounding neighborhoods as well as a federal oil embargo only allowed widening of the approach between Fairgrounds Drive and I-80. In 1977, a levee broke and flooded a portion of the developed land, turning it into protected wetlands that is home to endangered species. Because of its new status, environmental studies were needed in order to continue the project.|$|E
5|$|Christian, descended <b>from</b> <b>residents</b> of the Isle of Man, {{was born}} at Hook Norton, Oxfordshire in 1747.

40|$|We have {{examined}} two galactosyltransferase activities in membrane preparations obtained <b>from</b> <b>resident</b> macrophages, <b>from</b> <b>resident</b> macrophages maintained in culture for 24 hr, and from thioglycollate (TG) -elicited macrophages. Transfer of galactose from uridine diphosphate (UDP) -galactose to N-acetylglucosamine is 2. 6 times higher in membranes prepared from TG macrophages (107 +/- 5. 5 nmol/hr/mg) than in membranes prepared <b>from</b> <b>resident</b> macrophages (41 +/- 2. 0 nmol/hr/mg). Membranes obtained <b>from</b> <b>resident</b> macrophages cultured for 24 hr exhibit a 2. 5 times higher activity (102 +/- 4. 4 nmol/hr/mg) than membranes <b>from</b> <b>resident</b> cells plated for 4 hr. Transferase activity in membranes derived from TG macrophages is not significantly affected by overnight culture. The transferase reaction product, isolated on Bio-Gel P- 4 and analyzed by galactosidase treatments, {{was identified as}} galactosyl-beta 1, 4 -N-acetylglucosamine. The enzyme, therefore, is UDP-galactose: 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose 4 beta-galactosyltransferase. This {{is supported by the}} fact that this galactosyltransferase activity is specifically inhibited by high concentrations of N-acetylglucosamine (200 mM). We have also examined the transfer of galactose to N-acetyllactosamine. Membranes from TG-elicited macrophages contain a UDP-galactose:galactosyl-beta 1, 4 -N-acetylglucosamine 3 alpha-galactosyltransferase which synthesizes the trisaccharide, galactosyl-alpha 1, 3 -galactosyl-beta 1, 4 -N-acetylglucosamine. This product was identified by gel filtration chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, and galactosidase digestions. This alpha-galactosyltransferase activity was not detected in membranes prepared <b>from</b> <b>resident</b> macrophages. These results indicate that glycosyltransferase activities are modulated in populations of mouse macrophages, and that these changes correlate with changes in cell surface lactosaminoglycans reported previously...|$|R

50|$|The {{events of}} Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil chronicle the Umbrella Corporation's {{development}} of the Tyrant prototypes, the T-001 (the Proto-Tyrant) and T-002. Though the early Tyrants are defeated in their first encounters, Umbrella manages to use the battle data from those defeats to produce other, more efficient Tyrants in the later installments of Resident Evil. Numerous Tyrants have been created throughout the game series' storyline, such as Tyrant T-078 and the mass-produced Bandersnatches <b>from</b> <b>Resident</b> Evil Code: Veronica, Hypnos <b>from</b> <b>Resident</b> Evil Survivor and Thanatos <b>from</b> <b>Resident</b> Evil Outbreak, {{each with its own}} defining characteristics.

5|$|Bowie and {{his brother}} John were {{involved}} in a major court case in the late 1820s over land speculation. When the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory in 1803, it promised to honor all former land grant claims, and for the next 20years efforts were made to establish who owned what land. In May 1824, Congress authorized the superior courts of each territory to hear suits from those who claimed they had been overlooked. The Arkansas Superior Court received 126claims in late 1827 <b>from</b> <b>residents</b> who claimed to have purchased land in former Spanish grants from the Bowie brothers. Although the Superior Court originally confirmed most of those claims, the decisions were reversed in February 1831 after further research showed that the land had never belonged to the Bowies and that the original land grant documentation had been forged. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the reversal in 1833. When the disgruntled purchasers considered suing the Bowies, they discovered that the documents in the case had been removed from the court; left without evidence, they declined to pursue a case.|$|E
5|$|By 2002, Caltrans had two {{proposals}} {{for the part}} of the widening project between East Vista Way and Mission Road: building the new highway on top of the old one, or constructing a new roadway to the south of the San Luis Rey River. Concerns arose that the TransNet local sales tax would not be extended by voters, leading to the cancellation of that project. The San Diego Association of Governments included the widening east to Bonsall in the regional plan in 2003, but indicated that the portion from Bonsall to I-15 would be dependent on the availability of funding. Residents of Fallbrook and Bonsall criticized the fact that SR76 {{was one of the few}} TransNet projects that was not to be completed by the expiration of the tax in 2008. The city of Oceanside proposed plans for grade-separated interchanges with College Boulevard and Melrose Drive in 2004, as part of a proposal to convert the expressway through Oceanside to a freeway. After complaints <b>from</b> <b>residents,</b> these proposals were tabled.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of Shiller in the 2007 {{election}} largely {{focused on}} the lack of communication with ward residents, failure to obtain input <b>from</b> <b>residents</b> for zoning changes in the ward, her lack of involvement in community policing meetings, and the many years of blighted retail in the ward. Some critics charged that Shiller was frustrating developers while using the Wilson Yard project to maintain her political base. In 2007, Shiller defeated social worker James Cappleman with 53% of the vote. In October, 2007, Shiller became chair of the City Council's Human Relations Committee. In 2009, Shiller was criticized by Uptown residents for her perceived lack of engagement in address crime in the neighborhood, including a string of violent robberies in nearby Lakeview that attracted the attention of the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, and local TV news. Police interviewed said interventions from Shiller and her staff facilitated the protection of gang members from policing activity, allegedly for gaining voter base, {{according to a report in}} Chicago Magazine.|$|E

In 1220, the Hungarian-Croatian king Andrew II threatened retaliation with the royal army against knez Malduč and his relatives unless the piracy and heresy ended. In May 1221, Pope Honorius III sent legate Aconcius {{to the citizens of}} Split, among other cities, to prevent piracy and defend the Crusaders.

5|$|Offshore: A third {{population}} of killer whales {{in the northeast}} Pacific was discovered in 1988, when a humpback whale researcher observed them in open water. As their name suggests, they travel far from shore and feed primarily on schooling fish. However, because they have large, scarred and nicked dorsal fins resembling those of mammal-hunting transients, {{it may be that}} they also eat mammals and sharks. They have mostly been encountered off the west coast of Vancouver Island and near Haida Gwaii. Offshores typically congregate in groups of 20–75, with occasional sightings of larger groups of up to 200. Currently, little is known about their habits, but they are genetically distinct <b>from</b> <b>residents</b> and transients. Offshores appear to be smaller than the others, and females are characterized by dorsal fin tips that are continuously rounded.|$|E
