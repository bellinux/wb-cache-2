5|$|A barrier jet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> levels forms just {{upstream}} {{of mountain}} chains, with the mountains forcing the jet to be oriented {{parallel to the}} mountains.

In the North American Great Plains a southerly low-level jet helps fuel overnight thunderstorm activity during the warm season, normally in the form of mesoscale convective systems which form during the overnight hours. A similar phenomenon develops across Australia, which pulls moisture poleward from the Coral Sea towards cut-off lows which form mainly across southwestern portions of the continent.|$|E

40|$|August 19, 2009 Are prices sticky {{due to the}} {{presence}} of strategic complementarity in price setting? If so, to what extent? To address these questions, we investigate retailers' price setting behavior, and in particular strategic interaction between retailers, using a unique dataset containing by-the-second records of prices offered by retailers on a major Japanese price comparison website. We focus on fluctuations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> price among retailers, rather than the average price, examining how quickly <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> price is updated in response to changes in marginal costs. First, we find that, when <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> price falls rapidly, the frequency of changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> price is high, while the size of downward price adjustments remains largely unchanged. Second, we find a positive autocorrelation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frequency of changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> price, and that there tends to be a clustering where once a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> price occurs, such changes occur in succession. In contrast, there is no such autocorrelation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> size of changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> price. These findings suggest that retailers imitate each other when deciding to adjust (or not to adjust) their prices, and that the extensive margin plays a much more important role than <b>the</b> intensive margin <b>in</b> such strategic complementarity in price setting. 日本学術振興会・科学研究費補助金（学術創成研究費） = JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Creative Scientific Researc...|$|R

5|$|By contrast, the {{remainder}} of Europe saw stone towers being used in castles, {{but not in a}} way that fulfilled the range of functions seen in the western European keeps. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Low</b> Countries, it became popular for the local nobility to build stand-alone, square towers, but rarely as part of a wider castle. Similarly, square stone towers became popular in Venice, but these did not fulfil the same role as western keeps. In Germany, rectangular stone castles began to replace motte-and-bailey castles from the 12th century onwards. These designs included stone versions of the traditional Bergfriede, which still remained distinct from the domestic keeps used in more western parts of Europe, with the occasional notable exception, such as the large, residential Bergfried at Eltville Castle.|$|E
