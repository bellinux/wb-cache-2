5|$|After Rykmus {{was fired}} when the Oilers started the 1961 season poorly, Houston won ten {{consecutive}} games under Wally Lemm. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> games, against the Titans of New York, Cannon set a professional football record with 373 all-purpose {{yards and scored}} five touchdowns. His 216 rushing yards in the game also set an AFL record. At {{the end of the}} season, he was the AFL's leading rusher with 948 yards and led the league in all-purpose yards. The Oilers repeated as AFL champions and Cannon again was the game's MVP, scoring the only touchdown. The Sporting News named him to the 1961 AFL All-League Team and he was invited to play in the 1961 AFL All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Bickford went 16–11 with a 4.25 {{earned run}} average and made the National League All-Star team. He {{finished}} seventh {{in the league in}} complete games (15) and third in games started (36) behind teammate Warren Spahn and Ken Raffensberger of the Cincinnati Reds. He lost a no-hitter in the ninth inning <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> games. At season's end Bickford, alongside Spahn and teammate Johnny Sain created one of the most formidable pitching trios in the league for the next several years.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Hansen was {{assigned}} to the Pirates-affiliated Hollywood Stars, an Open-classification minor league team based in Los Angeles. He appeared in three games, accumulating a 1.35 ERA on the mound and one hit in three at-bats at the plate. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> contests, he and Red Munger combined to hold the rival Los Angeles Angels to a 1–0 shutout. After being voted outstanding player of the week for his short tenure, Hansen voluntarily retired himself a second time after Pittsburgh Pirates president Branch Rickey refused to pay him $750 ($ today) that he was owed. The Pirates sent him a contract to play for the Triple-A New Orleans Pelicans, along with a paycheck, but he did not report, opting to remain retired.|$|E

She also participated in five game test series against the Netherlands, the United States and Japan where her team won all games in those series.

5|$|Following {{the winter}} break, Diarra {{struggled}} with a thigh injury and didn't appear {{with the team}} for almost three months. In March 2007, he finally returned to the team in its 3–1 win over Derby du Rhône rivals Saint-Étienne appearing as a substitute. During the season, Diarra complained twice with regards to playing time, which led to Houllier equivocally questioning Diarra's ego. The feud culminated on 6 April when Houllier dropped Diarra from the squad to face Valenciennes the following day and then ordered him {{to play for the}} club's reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth level of French football. Diarra refused the orders and Houllier responded by reportedly threatening not to play him {{for the rest of the}} season. The Lyon manager later stated the Diarra should issue an apology to him and the team. The defensive midfielder did not budge and, subsequently, missed the team's next four league matches, as well as the 2007 Coupe de la Ligue Final. Diarra returned to the team on 28 April playing the entire match in a 3–1 win over Le Mans. He repeated this feat in three of the team's last five matches as Lyon were crowned champions for the sixth consecutive season. Included <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> three matches was Diarra's first league goal for the club, which came in a 3–0 victory over his former club Lens.|$|E

Representative matches against MCC and a full-strength international side assembled by T. N. Pearce for the Scarborough festival were also lost. And the Indians became the first touring side to lose against the Minor Counties representative side since the West Indian cricket team in England in 1928, largely as a result of a remarkable unbeaten 202 by Phil Sharpe that enabled the Minor Counties to reach a target of 334 with only four wickets lost.|$|E
25|$|Nicholls was a powerfully-built left-handed batsman, usually {{used as an}} opener, and a wicketkeeper.

In an 18-season first-class cricket career, he played more than 200 matches for Kent, plus almost 100 List A games, but was a regular member of the side with a fixed place in the team for only a couple of years in the early 1970s. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> seasons, 1971, he completed exactly 1,000 first-class runs, the only time he passed this particular landmark.|$|E
