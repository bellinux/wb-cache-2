2500|$|Since 2012 the [...] (NISC) {{has worked}} to provide [...] "the right {{information}} to the right people at the right time" [...] by use of common terminology among the emergency management community and <b>first-responders</b> with a mission of standardizing the structured geo-spatial data to be shared online over a variety of platforms. The result {{is to create a}} Common Operating Picture (COP) that generates accurate and timely information displayed visually, both at the strategic level for decision makers and at the tactical level for people on site. The NISC promotes the sharing of code, data widgets, and training in order to increase the quality of the situational awareness. Large scale exercises like the [...] week-long event coordinated by the [...] (CUSEC) and actual operational use of these data sharing methods have also advanced the work of NISC to expand the usability of GIS-based information sharing for enhanced situational awareness.|$|E
2500|$|Although Jenner used cowpox, {{the vaccine}} now {{contains}} a virus immunologically related to cowpox and smallpox viruses called vaccinia which causes a mild infection. The vaccine is infectious which improves its effectiveness, but causes serious complications {{for people with}} impaired immune systems (for example chemotherapy and AIDS patients, and people with eczema), and is not yet considered safe for pregnant women. A woman planning on conceiving within one month should not receive the smallpox immunization until after the pregnancy. In {{the event of an}} outbreak, the woman should delay pregnancy if possible. Vaccines that only contain attenuated vaccinia viruses (an attenuated virus is one in which the pathogenicity has been decreased through serial passage) have been proposed, but some researchers have questioned the possible effectiveness of such a vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), [...] "vaccination within 3 days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms {{in the vast majority of}} people. Vaccination 4 to 7 days after exposure likely offers some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease." [...] This, along with vaccinations of so-called <b>first-responders,</b> is the current plan of action being devised by the United States Department of Homeland Security (including Federal Emergency Management Agency) in the United States.|$|E

40|$|MetView Version 2. 0 is an easy-to-use {{model for}} accessing, viewing, and {{analyzing}} meteorological data. MetView provides both graphical and numerical displays of data. It can accommodate data from an extensive meteorological monitoring network that includes near-surface monitoring locations, instrumented towers, sodars, and meteorologist observations. MetView is used operationally for both routine, emergency response, and research applications at the U. S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site. At the Site's Emergency Operations Center, MetView {{aids in the}} access, visualization, and interpretation of real-time meteorological data. Historical data can also be accessed and displayed. Emergency response personnel at the Emergency Operations Center use MetView products {{in the formulation of}} protective action recommendations and other decisions. In the initial stage of an emergency, MetView can be operated using a very simple, five-step procedure. This <b>first-responder</b> procedure allows non-technical staff to rapidly generate meteorological products and disseminate key information. After <b>first-responder</b> information products are produced, the Emergency Operations Center's technical staff can conduct more sophisticated analyses using the model. This may include examining the vertical variation in winds, assessing recent changes in atmospheric conditions, evaluating atmospheric mixing rates, and forecasting changes in meteorological conditions. This user's guide provides easy-to-follow instructions for both <b>first-responder</b> and routine operation of the model. Examples, with explanations, are provided for each type of MetView output display.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis identified {{a need for}} improvement in <b>first-responder</b> crisis decision making. The primary research question was, would mindfulness training be worthwhile {{as a means to}} enhance <b>first-responder</b> crisis decision making? Qualitative research methods (primarily a thematic analysis of the literature) were utilized to explore the areas of first responder operations, crisis decision making, and mindfulness training to identify key categories in the data relevant to the primary and sub-research questions. Evidence uncovered during this research supports a conclusion that mindfulness training may be one way in which first responders can improve upon their capacity to make effective decisions during a crisis. It was demonstrated that these improvements to crisis decision making resultant from mindfulness training could very well culminate in significant improvement of outcomes during future emergencies and disasters at which mindful first responders are present. Despite significant implementation challenges that were identified, systematic analysis of the literature revealed sufficient evidence to warrant serious consideration for further study and application of this theory in the field, including potential implementation of discipline-specific and culturally relevant mindfulness training systems within first responder organizations.
