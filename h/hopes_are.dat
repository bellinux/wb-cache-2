5|$|The {{nations of}} the world fund the {{construction}} of the machine at Cape Canaveral. An international panel is assembled to choose a candidate to travel in the machine. Although Arroway is a frontrunner to go, her <b>hopes</b> <b>are</b> scuppered by Christian philosopher Palmer Joss, a panel member whom Arroway met and briefly became romantically involved with in Puerto Rico. When he brings attention to her atheism, the panel selects Drumlin instead on the belief he would be more representative of humanity. However, on the day the machine is tested, a religious fanatic destroys the machine in a suicide bombing, killing Drumlin and many others.|$|E
5|$|The film's prologue {{shows the}} {{preparations}} {{for a hot}} air balloon ride. The balloon is tethered to the spire of a church next to a river, with a man named Yefim (Nikolay Glazkov) attempting to make the flight by use of a harness roped beneath the balloon. At the very moment of his attempt an ignorant mob arrive from the river and attempt to thwart the flight, putting a firebrand {{into the face of}} one of the men on the ground assisting Yefim. In spite of this the balloon is successfully released and Yefim is overwhelmed and delighted by the view from above and the sensation of flying, but he can not prevent a crash landing shortly after. He is the first of several creative characters, representing the daring escapist, whose <b>hopes</b> <b>are</b> easily crushed. After the crash, a horse is seen rolling on its back by a pond, a symbol of life–one of many horses in the movie.|$|E
25|$|The planned {{opening of}} the Pike River Mine in early 2008 spurred new {{investments}} in upgrading port facilities at the town.

The {{opening of the}} new mine, {{as well as the}} planned Spring Creek mine, was called the biggest investment happening in the area for a hundred years.|$|E
40|$|Hope {{plays an}} {{important}} role in all individuals’ lives both today and in the future. While <b>hope</b> and hopelessness <b>are</b> important concepts and the subjects of much theorizing in psychology, theology, philosophy, political science, nursing, as well as in literature and the arts, it is absent from economics. This silence on <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> notable since <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> fundamentally at the centre of choice, especially intertemporal choice, which is at the centre of economic analysis. To place hope at the centre of intertemporal choice, it is important to clearly define what <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> and what it <b>is</b> not. What <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> not <b>is</b> constant. <b>Hope</b> <b>is</b> not optimism; <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> not unfounded dreams divorced from reality; <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> not irrational. I distil what <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> from its characterization in a number of different disciplines. A comparison of characterizations identifies a number of commonalities and common definitions. Using the derived set of definitions, I incorporate hope into economic analysis, consider what implications hope has for the modelling of choice and for economic behaviour, and discuss whether <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> implicitly imbedded in or has been abandoned, to our eternal cost, by economics.

Although King Harkinian immediately offers aid, Gwonam explains that according to a prophecy, only Link can defeat Ganon. Link is transported to Koridai and Gwonam shows him the fabled island's giant stone statues known as the Faces of Evil which Link must conquer. During Link's time in Koridai, Princess Zelda is kidnapped by Ganon and imprisoned in his lair.|$|E

500|$|They {{arrive at}} the Vineyard of Eyes, but an army of cutters (ants, {{who would like to}} see all warm-blooded creatures gone) destroys the starshade and kill both Hamnet and Frill. The group's <b>hopes</b> <b>are</b> crushed until they realize a new possibility: that the plague was {{developed}} by the humans as a biological agent to be used against the rats. The group hastens home, and find their theory proved correct by the humans' new medication, developed without the supposed [...] "cradle cure". Luxa furiously exposes the covert military project. Dr. Neveeve is executed for her participation and Solovet, the project's head, is imprisoned in preparation for a trial. Following up on a promise to Ripred, Luxa sends doses of the cure to the gnawers while the Regalian hospital treats as many human and bat victims as possible. Though she is healing, Gregor's mother is too weak to go home, and so the book ends with Gregor confiding his problems to his neighbor Mrs. Cormaci.|$|E
500|$|Early {{in series}} ten, Joseph's brother's {{condition}} deteriorates {{and he is}} admitted to Holby City Hospital in need of an operation. [...] Faye supports Joseph, and the two kiss. Joseph's <b>hopes</b> <b>are</b> raised when his brother opens his eyes, and he considers expensive neurology treatment in America to try and rouse Harry from his coma. Shortly thereafter, however, Harry's condition worsens again, and Joseph and his mother allow Harry to die. Following his brother's death, Joseph returns to work to find Jac on trial for Sam's old position. This reignites their feud, and Joseph is unable to block Jac from gaining the position. His relationship with Faye develops slowly, however Joseph's suspicions are raised when she lies to him about her whereabouts on several occasions, leading to the eventual discovery that the police suspect her {{of the murder of}} her second husband, Donald. An exhumation reveals that Donald did not die of cancer, as Faye insisted, but of arsenic poisoning. Joseph remains suspicious, but supports Faye as their relationship continues to develop. When Faye has a pregnancy scare, he proposes to her, and insists that he meant it even after the discovery she is not actually pregnant. Joseph is devastated when Faye appears to have stolen £5,000 from him and left the country, but discovers she is in fact in trouble in South Africa. After flying out with colleague Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow), Faye reveals she has a ten-year-old son, Archie, who lives in a care home because of a genetic disease. Joseph saves Archie's life in a risky operation, and he and Faye return from South Africa engaged once more, much to Jac's chagrin.|$|E

2500|$|With the first-year {{students}} enrolled in the 2006–2007 school year, Grinnell has ended its need-blind admissions policy for international applicants. Under the old policy, students from countries outside the U.S. were admitted without any consideration of their ability to afford four years of study at the college. However, financial aid offers to these students were limited to half the cost of tuition. International students frequently carried very high workloads in an effort to pay the bills, and their academic performance often suffered. Under the new [...] "need-sensitive" [...] or [...] "need-aware" [...] policy, international students whose demonstrated financial needs can be met are given a slight admissions edge over applicants who can't. The twin <b>hopes</b> <b>are</b> that the enrolled international students will be able to dedicate more energy to their schoolwork, and also that this will ultimately allow the college to provide higher tuition grants to international students.|$|E

2500|$|In 200 CE, when Yuan Shao was {{preparing}} for a campaign against a rival warlord Cao Cao, he set up military garrisons at Liyang (黎陽) and Yan Ford (延津).

Why don't you faithfully perform your duties by defending the border and maintaining peace within your jurisdiction?" [...] Yuan Shao refused to listen to Cui Yan and insisted on attacking Cao Cao, but ended up being defeated by Cao at the decisive Battle of Guandu later that year. After Yuan Shao died in 202, his sons Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang formed their own military forces and started fighting for control over their father's territories in northern China. Both Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang wanted Cui Yan on their side, but Cui refused to help either of them and claimed that he was ill. As a consequence, he was imprisoned by Yuan Shang, but was later saved by Yin Kui (陰夔) and Chen Lin.|$|E

[...] Because he was saving {{for a return to}} Columbia to get his Ph.D., Toole was a notorious skinflint during his year at USL. His friends noticed this and forced him to pay for and throw a party at his home. The party was a success and generally considered the best party thrown that year. In contrast to this image of an outgoing, lively young man, when Toole's mother came to visit, friends noticed that he became sullen and withdrawn. His friend Pat Rickels commented that Thelma [...] "was absolutely convinced that he was without flaw and that all the hopes of the world lay in him. It was an extreme form of maternalism, where all your pride and all your <b>hopes</b> <b>are</b> in one person. He had to grow up with that burden. She was a very ostentatious, shrill, loud-voiced, bossy, bragging woman." ...|$|E

[...] In October 1906, Saunderson died, and Long was chosen as the new Chairman of Irish Unionist Alliance (IUA) - aimed at closer {{co-operation}} between northern and southern parties. [...] Three months later, he was also elected as Chairman of the Ulster Unionist Council (UUC). In 1907, he formed the Union Defence League (UDL) [...] as a support in Great Britain for Irish unionism. The UDL in London linked with the UUC in Belfast and the IUA in Dublin. It had support from Conservative backbenchers but not the leadership. It was active in 1907–08 and again after 1911 when the Third Home Rule Bill was imminent; with the Primrose League it created the 1914 British Covenant mirroring the 1912 Ulster Covenant. [...] Although Long never openly supported the most militant Unionists, who were prepared to fight the Southern nationalists (and perhaps the British Army) to prevent home rule for Ireland, contemporary accounts indicate that he probably had prior knowledge of the Larne gunrunning.|$|E
