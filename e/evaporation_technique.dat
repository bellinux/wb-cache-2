50|$|To make {{a tunnel}} {{junction}} in plate condenser geometry with a capacitance of 1 femtofarad, using an oxide layer of electric permittivity 10 and thickness one nanometer, {{one has to}} create electrodes with dimensions of approximately 100 by 100 nanometers.

50|$|A {{distinguishing}} feature of superconducting quantum circuits is {{the usage of}} a Josephson junction - an electrical element non existent in normal conductors. A junction is a weak connection between two leads of a superconducting wire, usually implemented as {{a thin layer of}} insulator with a shadow <b>evaporation</b> <b>technique.</b> The condensate wave functions on {{the two sides of the}} junction are weakly correlated - they are allowed to have different superconducting phases, contrary to the case of a continuous superconducting wire, where the superconducting wave function must be continuous. The current through the junction occurs by quantum tunneling. This is used to create a non-linear inductance which is essential for qubit design, as it allows a design of anharmonic oscillators. A quantum harmonic oscillator cannot be used as a qubit, as there is no way to address only two of its states.|$|E

The international program {{was carried out in}} microgravity conditions in parabolic flight. A {{description of the}} laboratory equipment, conceived to perform experimental tests in reduced gravity conditions, and which is based on the gas <b>evaporation</b> <b>technique,</b> is given. The gas <b>evaporation</b> <b>technique</b> utilizes one or more heated crucible to vaporize solids materials (SiO, Mg) in a low pressure of inert or reactive gas inside of a vacuum bell jar. The vapor pressures of the materials are controlled by the temperature of the crucibles. The temperature and pressure of inert gas are also controlled. By varying the vapor pressure relative to the gas temperature and pressure, the conditions for substantial grain condensation can be controlled and grain formation measured using light scattering techniques. Thus the partial pressure for grain condensation, can be measured as a function of temperature. The gas <b>evaporation</b> <b>technique</b> has the advantage that complex chemical systems can be studied by using multiple crucibles each containing solid source material. Experimental results and future trends are addressed...|$|E
