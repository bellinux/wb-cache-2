5|$|Immediately {{following}} the Civil War, the academy enjoyed unprecedented fame {{as a result}} of the role its graduates had played. However, the post-war years were a <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the academy as it struggled to admit and reintegrate cadets from former confederate states. The first cadets from Southern states were re-admitted in 1868, and 1870 saw the admission of the first black cadet, James Webster Smith of South Carolina. Smith endured harsh treatment and was eventually dismissed for academic deficiency under controversial circumstances in 1874. As a result, Henry O. Flipper of Georgia became the first black graduate in 1877, graduating 50th in a class of 76. Two of the most notable graduates during this period were George Washington Goethals from the class of 1880, and John J. Pershing from the class of 1886. Goethals gained prominence as the chief engineer of the Panama Canal, and Pershing would become famous for his exploits against the famed Pancho Villa in Mexico and later for leading American Forces during World War I.|$|E

The election came at a <b>difficult</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Pierce, as his father, sister, and brother were all seriously ill, while Jane continued to suffer from chronic poor health.
