40|$|International audienceThe {{induction}} heating principle {{has been successfully}} introduced for about 20 years in <b>domestic</b> <b>cooking</b> <b>appliances.</b> The technical developments now concern {{the improvement of the}} current appliances and the introduction of new functions. So, one tendency is the design of multiwinding induction coils that are very adaptive concerning the shape and the power capability. This paper describes different original converter topologies designed to supply multiwinding coils, and, in addition, multicoil systems. The proposed topologies are based on particular use and associations of zero-voltage switching series-resonant converters. They are all characterized by a frequency-synchronized operating mode, in order to prevent any acoustic harm that could result from beating frequency-interference...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} {{as part of a}} two-year study funded by DGXVII of the EC and the UKDETR in association with the TTS Institute (Finland). The general context of the {{research was}} that of reducing the energy consumption of the existing stock of <b>domestic</b> electric <b>cooking</b> <b>appliances</b> by influencing consumer behaviour at the points of use. The study sought to clarify the potential for influencing consumers to save energy when cooking, regardless of their food choices/diets or indeed the available cooking equipment. For this purpose, a cooking-specific information pack was developed to provide consumers with detailed and reliable information about <b>cooking</b> <b>appliances,</b> the energy consumption of cooking practices as well as energy-saving tips. A literature search was undertaken to evaluate the previously published information/advice regarding households energy-wise: energy efficiency in general and <b>cooking</b> <b>appliances</b> in particular. Most information campaigns (and the associated material), addressing household energy use, have focused primarily on space heating. Although some advice on cooking practices has been made available, the published energy use information usually lacked specific examples and some inaccuracies and ambiguities were evident. This suggested that the underlying quantitative consumption data were weak or non-existent. The published literature was also reviewed to assess food consumption habits in Great Britain. In general, the consumption of food in the home has declined over the 20 years to 1995. There are significant seasonal variations in the amount of food consumed within the home. Information about the types of meal prepared at home is not well documented. There is some evidence from a small number of studies (some regional and some national) of a conventional behaviour pattern with respect to food preparation and meal preferences. Food preparation tasks tend to be done predominantly by women, and `traditional' meals (e. g. a roast dinner) are usually preferred when cooking for guests. One recent study concluded that the sociology of food preparation remains unexplored. Two questionnaire surveys were therefore undertaken: (i) a survey of food choices and meal preparation practices, and (ii) a one-week diary of home cooking whereby the participants recorded details of the food prepared/eaten in their homes. As a result, an understanding of the frequency of <b>cooking</b> <b>appliance</b> use and the frequency of meal preparation was obtained, from which a classification of meals based on cooking duration was defined...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSabaf, a world leading {{manufacturer}} of components for <b>domestic</b> gas <b>cooking</b> <b>appliances,</b> {{went through a}} transformation process between 1993 and 2005 to develop a strategic approach to corporate responsibility. This case describes the learning and change process within the company that set the ground for today’s success. This teaching case builds on data gathered through sites primary and secondary data. The case research protocol explored {{the notion that the}} company was learning how to interact and respond to its changing context while its responses were creating the ground for internal organisational change that in turn would impact the relationship between the company and its context. Sabaf’s case is not only a move from an implicit to explicit approach to corporate responsibility, but more profoundly it portrays a company that was engaged in developing a more ‘humanistic’ approach to management that permeated the whole organization. The term ‘corporate responsibility’ was used to describe much older concepts that valued people and the natural environment alongside economics. The case also shows the process of organizational leadership for learning, management innovation and change that supported the processes through which this approach was developed and integrated into the company. This case provides unique insights into the approach Sabaf adopted in its pioneering transformation to become a leading corporate responsibility company and a world leader in its sector. This case {{can be used as a}} benchmark for other companies that might embark on a similar process affecting the business as a whole...|$|R

40|$|Dependency {{of urban}} Ethiopian {{households}} on rural areas for about 85 {{percent of their}} fuel needs is a significant cause of deforestation and forest degradation, resulting in growing fuel scarcity and higher firewood prices. One response to reducing the pressure on rural lands is for urban households to switch fuel sources (from fuelwood to electricity, for example) to slow deforestation and forest degradation and reduce indoor air pollution. However, such an energy transition is conditioned on the adoption of appropriate <b>cooking</b> <b>appliances</b> or stove technologies {{by the majority of}} users. This paper investigates urban energy transition and technology adoption conditions using a dataset of 350 urban households in Tigrai, in northern Ethiopia.

40|$|This study {{came about}} in {{response}} to the interest in, and concern about, <b>domestic</b> <b>cooking</b> and cooking skills that has arisen in recent years. It critically reviews the current state of thinking about cooking and cooking skills, provides a critique of both popular and academic discourse and proposes new opportunities for policy and future research. With little existing empirically acquired knowledge and no theoretical convention for the study of cooking and cooking skills, the primary research was designed to be exploratory and to provide systematically researched insights and understanding. It took a qualitative approach in order to provide intricate detail about people's <b>domestic</b> <b>cooking</b> practices, the skills they use, and their beliefs and opinions about cooking in the home and a systematically researched understanding of these aspects of cooking. The findings revealed that "cooking skills" could be seen specifically as the skills of <b>domestic</b> <b>cooking</b> (as opposed to those of professional cooking) and as either "task centred" (the skills involved in a particular task) or as "person centred" (the skills of an individual carrying out a task in a particular context). They also revealed that the informant's (domestic) "cooking skills" consisted of many different types of perceptual and conceptual skills as well as mechanical skills and academic knowledge. The findings revealed that the informants had very individual approaches towards <b>domestic</b> <b>cooking</b> but that there were many beliefs and opinions that they shared. The research also found that there was a complex "interrelationship" between the informants' <b>domestic</b> <b>cooking</b> skills, their approaches towards <b>domestic</b> <b>cooking</b> and their <b>domestic</b> <b>cooking</b> practices and food choice. The findings of this study provide an additional and different perspective of the relationship between <b>domestic</b> food provision, <b>cooking</b> and cooking skills allowing the development of relevant debates and concerns. They clarify that cooking skills are an influence on food choice but show that this influence is complex. They challenge current theoretical explanations of the impact of technology on <b>domestic</b> <b>cooking</b> and food provision, for example, and the deskilling of the domestic cook...|$|R
