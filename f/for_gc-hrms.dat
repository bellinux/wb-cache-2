40|$|Gas {{chromatography}} with {{electron ionization}} and full scan high resolution mass spectrometry with an Orbitrap mass analyzer (GC-EI-full scan Orbitrap HRMS) was evaluated for residue analysis. Pesticides in {{fruit and vegetables}} were taken as an example application. The relevant aspects for GC-MS based residue analysis, including the resolving power (15, 000 to 120, 000 FWHM at m/z 200), scan rate, dynamic range, selectivity, sensitivity, analyte identification, and utility of existing EI-libraries, are assessed and discussed in detail. The optimum acquisition conditions in full scan mode (m/z 50 – 500) were a resolving power of 60, 000 and an automatic-gain-control target value of 3 E 6. These conditions provided (i) an optimum mass accuracy: within 2 ppm over a wide concentration range, with/without matrix, enabling the use of ± 5 ppm mass extraction windows (ii) adequate scan speed: minimum 12 scans/peak, (iii) an intra-scan dynamic range sufficient to achieve LOD/LOQs ≤ 0. 5 pg in fruit/vegetable matrices (corresponding to ≤ 0. 5 μg kg − 1) for most pesticides. EI-Orbitrap spectra were consistent over a very wide concentration range (5 orders) with good match values against NIST (EI-quadrupole) spectra. The applicability for quantitative residue analysis was verified by validation of 54 pesticides in three matrices (tomato, leek, orange) at 10 and 50 μg/kg. The method involved a QuEChERS-based extraction with a solvent switch into iso-octane, and 1 μL hot splitless injection into the GC-HRMS system. A recovery between 70 and 120 % and a repeatability RSD − 1. The pesticides could be identified according to the applicable EU criteria <b>for</b> <b>GC-HRMS</b> (SANTE/ 11945 / 2015). GC-EI-full scan Orbitrap HRMS {{was found to be}} highly suited for quantitative pesticide residue analysis. The potential of qualitative screening to extend the scope makes it an attractive alternative to GC-triple quadrupole MS. </p...|$|E
40|$|Following the dioxin {{crisis of}} 1999, several studies were {{conducted}} {{to assess the impact}} of this crisis on the dioxin body burden in the Belgian population. The Scientific Institute of Public Health identified a population from whom plasma samples were available and from whom, during the follow up survey, plasma samples were obtained in 2000. In total, 496 samples were collected <b>for</b> <b>GC-HRMS</b> and CALUX analyses to verify statistical assessment conclusions. This study was seen as an opportunity to validate the CALUX bioassay for biological sample analysis and to compare toxic equivalency (TEQ) values obtained by the reference GC-HRMS technique and by the screening method. This article focuses on the validation results of the CALUX bioassay for the analyses of the dioxin fractions of blood plasma. The sample preparation is based on a liquid-liquid extraction, followed by an acid silica in series with an activated carbon clean-up. A good recovery (82 %) and reproducibility (coefficient of variation less than 25 %) were found for this method. Based on 341 plasma samples, a significant correlation was established between the bioassay and chemical method (R = 0. 64). However, a proportional systematic error was observed when the results obtained with the CALUX bioassay were regressed with the results from the GC-HRMS analyses. The limit of quantification (LOQ) used to calculate TEQ values from the GC-HRMS determinations, the use of the relative potency values instead of the toxic equivalent factor and the potential of CALUX bioassay to measure all compounds with affinity for the AhR may partly explain this proportional systematic error. Nevertheless, the present results suggest that the CALUX bioassay could be a promising valid screening method for human blood plasma analyses. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and {{polychlorinated dibenzofurans}} (PCDFs) are two {{structurally}} related groups of chemicals, generally {{referred to as}} `dioxins´. These are of great concern due to their high toxicity and global spread. Other groups of compounds with similar chemical structure and toxicity mechanisms are the brominated analogues polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PBDDs) and polybrominated dibenzofurans (PBDFs), and the dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Numerous studies have been undertaken to investigate sources and transport routes of dioxins. However, {{much remains to be}} done, including analytical, inventories of dioxin-like compounds, such as PBDD/Fs, and the development of more convenient analytical methods. The currently standard procedure for analyzing dioxins (and dioxin-like compounds) is to use Soxhlet extraction followed by multi-step clean-up and gas chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry (GC- HRMS) for detection. Unfortunately, this method is very solvent, labor and time-consuming, making it very expensive. The main aim of the studies this thesis was to develop pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) with integrated clean up techniques for fast, convenient preparation of dioxin samples. PLE with integrated clean-up has previously been used for extracting dioxins from biological samples, but in these studies the possibility of extending its use to abiotic samples was explored. The results show that PLE with an integrated carbon trap is suitable for analyzing dioxins in various types of soil samples, sediment and flue gas samples. The results also showed that it has potential for analyzing dioxins in fly ash. The thesis focuses on developments of the methodology for dioxin analysis, but also includes results obtained from PBDDs and dioxin-like PCB analyses. In addition, the possibility of using various other kinds of detection techniques rather than GC-HRMS, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or two-dimensional gas chromatography with micro electron capture detection (GCxGC-µECD) was explored. The results indicate that ELISA and GCxGC-µECD could serve as complementary detection systems in some cases. However, it is not yet possible to fully replace GC-HRMS. A further refinement of the PLE with in-cell clean-up technique is the modular approach developed in these studies. With this technique it is possible to include various steps for both clean-up and fractionation. For example, sulphuric acid impregnated silica could be combined with active carbon for the simultaneous removal of lipids (along with other interferences) and fractionation of PCBs and PCDD/Fs. It was shown that the method could provide data that agreed reasonably well with both reference values and values obtained using traditional methods. In general PLE proved to have high extraction efficiency and to yield very similar congener profiles to the reference method. In addition, it was shown that it allowed one-step extraction and clean-up of a salmon sample. Such single-step procedures are the ultimate goals for any extraction technique, and it would be highly desirable to develop one-step methods that could be extended to other types of samples. For the rest of the matrices tested (soil, sediment, mussel and crab tissue and flue gas) the method was successful, however a final polishing step is currently required, involving either dilution or clean-up using miniaturized multilayer silica columns, to obtain extracts that are pure enough <b>for</b> <b>GC-HRMS</b> analysis. Using the developed modular-PLE system substantial costs could be saved. It was estimated that the method could reduce the cost of preparing samples by up to 90 %, which would greatly facilitate large-scale inventories...|$|E
