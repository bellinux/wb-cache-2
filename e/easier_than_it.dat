5|$|On 29 August 1945, MacArthur {{was ordered}} to {{exercise}} authority through the Japanese government machinery, including the Emperor Hirohito. MacArthur's headquarters was located in the Dai Ichi Life Insurance Building in Tokyo. Unlike in Germany, where the Allies had in May 1945 abolished the German state, the Americans chose to allow the Japanese state to continue to exist, albeit under their ultimate control. Unlike Germany, {{there was a certain}} partnership between the occupiers and occupied as MacArthur decided to rule Japan via the Emperor and the {{most of the rest of}} the Japanese elite. The Emperor was a living god to the Japanese people, and MacArthur found that ruling via the Emperor made his job in running Japan much <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> otherwise would have been.|$|E
5|$|Professor Onassis, {{who invented}} the time machine in the 1800s, arrives in the {{original}} version of the machine soon after and future Candace steals it. She travels back to the day the boys built the rollercoaster in their backyard and succeeds in getting her mother to see them, finally fulfilling her dream of busting them. However, in doing so, she accidentally leads Perry, their pet platypus who is secretly a suave secret agent, to be injured while stopping an evil magnet mechanism. As a result, Perry's nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, comes out unharmed {{from the effects of}} the now-destroyed machine. Over time, everything is altered and the Tri-State Area becomes childproof for fear of a repeat of Phineas and Ferb's dangerous activities. Doofenshmirtz eventually gains the upper hand, effectively becoming the ruler. He claims to be a nice Emperor, though, since he can remember everyone's name (though this is considerably <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> seems, since one of his rules is that everyone has to be named Joe and requires everyone to wear lab coats at all times). Also, because of Doofenshmirtz succeeding, the Agency is now forced into a oath to obey him, resulting a demoralized Perry to fail more on his missions against Doofenshmirtz and is forbidden to use the time machine that Candace previously used as suggested by Major Monogram. After arriving in the dystopian future Doofenshmirtz rules, Candace finds the time machine in a junk yard and returns to the day of the rollercoaster to stop herself from interfering like before, stopping the dystopia from occurring.|$|E

25|$|Testosterone {{increases}} {{body weight}} (and increases appetite). The form that this weight gain will take depends on {{diet and exercise}} as well as genetic factors. Since testosterone has anabolic effects, gain of lean muscle mass will be <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> previously was for transgender men. Moderate amounts of exercise will cause greater gains and will ameliorate some of the adverse effects of testosterone.|$|E
25|$|When Grisons {{became part}} of Switzerland in 1803, it had a {{population}} of roughly 73,000, of whom around 36,600 were Romansh speakers—many of them monolingual—living mostly within the Romansh-speaking valleys. The language border with German, which had mostly been stable since the 16th century, now began moving again {{as more and more}} villages shifted to German. One cause was the admission of Grisons as a Swiss canton, which brought Romansh-speakers into more frequent contact with German-speakers. Another factor was the increased power of the central government of Grisons, which had always used German as its administrative language. In addition, many Romansh-speakers migrated to the larger cities, which were German-speaking, while speakers of German settled in Romansh villages. Moreover, economic changes meant that the Romansh-speaking villages, which had mostly been self-sufficient, engaged in more frequent commerce with German-speaking regions. Also, improvements in the infrastructure made travel and contact with other regions much <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> had been.|$|E

[...] Paul defended her musical ability: [...] "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard...

The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic." [...] He went on to say, [...] "We thought we were in it for the fun... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves."

2500|$|The {{country rock}} {{of the mine}} is granite. The large mining sett (about [...] ) is crossed by many tin-bearing lodes which are {{substantially}} vertical and trend east-north-east. Most of the mine's excavations were made into just three of these lodes and were relatively shallow. The formation of the lodes was accompanied by extensive metasomatism which converted much of the plagioclase feldspar in the surrounding granite into the soft mineral kaolinite, and made excavation <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> {{would have been in}} unaltered rock.|$|E
2500|$|Guderian {{argued that}} the tank would be the decisive weapon of the next war. [...] "If the tanks succeed, then victory follows", he wrote. In an article {{addressed}} to critics of tank warfare, he wrote [...] "until our critics can produce some new and better method of making a successful land attack other than self-massacre, we shall continue to maintain our beliefs that tanks—properly employed, needless to say—are today the best means available for land attack." [...] Addressing the faster rate at which defenders could reinforce an area than attackers could penetrate it during the First World War, Guderian wrote that [...] "since reserve forces will now be motorized, the building up of new defensive fronts is <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> used to be; the chances of an offensive based on the timetable of artillery and infantry co-operation are, as a result, even slighter {{today than they were}} in the last war." [...] He continued, [...] "We believe that by attacking with tanks we can achieve a higher rate of movement than has been hitherto obtainable, and—what is perhaps even more important—that we can keep moving once a breakthrough has been made." [...] Guderian additionally required that tactical radios be widely used to facilitate co-ordination and command by having one installed in all tanks.|$|E
2500|$|Klass's {{modus operandi}} {{when dealing with}} opponents such as Friedman was exceptional. [...] He seemed to have an acute {{understanding}} of his position in both his career and his hobby and the power that position afforded him. [...] When he learned of Friedman's plans to move to Canada in 1980, Klass {{wrote a letter to}} A.G. McNamara with the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics at the National Research Council in Ottawa. [...] For decades the NRC had been the unwilling recipient of UFO reports collected by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. [...] The NRC did not research the reports they received; they merely classified them as [...] "meteorite" [...] or [...] "non-meteorite" [...] and filed them. [...] The purpose of Klass's letter was to bring [...] "bad tidings" [...] - that Stanton Friedman was moving to Canada. [...] Klass warned that Friedman would begin accusing them of UFO coverups. [...] He then went on to smear Friedman's professionalism, while simultaneously claiming to be Friedman's friend when discussing topics other than UFOs. [...] Ten days later a memo was sent within the NRC management which said, [...] "I don't know {{what we can do to}} prepare for the arrival in Canada of this man Friedman, but if he acts as Klass predicts we can ill afford the publicity he will generate for us." [...] The decision was made quickly to turn over all UFO reports older than a year to the Public Archives of Canada. [...] Klass's single letter apparently prompted a major records relocation in Canada and subsequently made Friedman's research <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> otherwise might have been.|$|E
