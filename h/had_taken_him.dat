5|$|Charles Voorhis's {{job with}} Nash <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> {{to a new}} home in Kenosha, Wisconsin; Jerry Voorhis joined his parents there on his return from Europe. As part of his {{recovery}} from his illness, he spent several weeks in northwestern Wyoming, working on a ranch. In Kenosha, he met a social worker named Alice Louise Livingston and married her on November 27, 1924, in her hometown of Washington, Iowa. Resuming his blue-collar career after his marriage, Voorhis moved to North Carolina with his wife and went to work in a Ford plant in Charlotte until being offered work as a teacher in an Illinois school for underprivileged boys, teaching three grades, coaching sports, and giving religious talks in the school's chapel each morning. This was followed by a year in Laramie, Wyoming, where the Voorhises founded and ran an orphanage for boys.|$|E
5|$|Harvard University offered Holst a lectureship for {{the first}} six months of 1932. Arriving via New York he was pleased to be reunited with his brother, Emil, whose acting career under the name of Ernest Cossart <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> to Broadway; but Holst was dismayed by the continual attentions of press interviewers and photographers. He enjoyed his time at Harvard, but was taken ill while there: a {{duodenal}} ulcer prostrated him for some weeks. He returned to England, joined briefly by his brother for a holiday together in the Cotswolds. His health declined, and he withdrew further from musical activities. One of his last efforts was to guide the young players of the St Paul's Girls' School orchestra through one of his final compositions, the Brook Green Suite, in March 1934.|$|E

5|$|On 28 May the {{conclave}} unanimously elected Orsini as Pope. He had {{not been}} seen as a serious candidate in past conclaves because he did not have political experience. Orsini was 75 at the time, and it took the cardinals two days to convince him to accept his election. He was recorded to have spent the night before his election sleepless and in tears. Even when the cardinals <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> into the Sistine Chapel for the formal vote to elect him pope after they had been convinced he would accept, he was still unwilling to accept his own election. Ultimately, he only accepted it after being convinced of it by Agustín Pipia the Master of the Dominican Order, of which he was a member. Upon accepting his election, he attempted to take the name Benedict XIV, which would have recognized Antipope Benedict XIII, the last Avignon Pope during the Western Schism. Lawyers from the Roman Curia eventually persuaded Orisini to take the name Benedict XIII.|$|E
5|$|By early 1957, Fisher {{had lost}} {{patience}} with Häyhänen {{and demanded that}} Moscow recall his deputy. In January 1957, Häyhänen received a message from Moscow promoting him to Lieutenant Colonel and granting him leave in the Soviet Union. Upon hearing he was due to return to Moscow, Häyhänen was fearful {{that he would be}} severely disciplined or even executed. Häyhänen fabricated stories to justify his delay, claiming to Fisher that the FBI <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> off the RMS Queen Mary. Fisher, unsuspecting, advised Häyhänen to leave the U.S. immediately to avoid FBI surveillance and handed him two hundred dollars for travel expenses. Prior to his departure, Häyhänen returned to Bear Mountain Park and retrieved the buried five thousand dollars for his own use. Häyhänen arrived in Paris on May Day, having sailed from the U.S. aboard La Liberté. Making contact with the KGB residency he received another two hundred dollars for his journey to Moscow. Four days later, instead of continuing his journey to the Soviet Union he entered the American embassy in Paris, announcing that he was a KGB officer and asking for asylum.|$|E

25|$|After curfew one night, two Police constables saw a very drunk German soldier {{staggering}} through town, a quick shove {{sent him}} flying {{down a steep}} flight of granite steps. The Police reported a drunk soldier lying on the steps and after an ambulance <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> away, the Policemen were given some cigarettes from a grateful German for helping their comrade. A minor assault on a German soldier could result in 3 months jail and a fine of 2 years salary.|$|E

Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; had he done so {{it would have been}} the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests. Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> by surprise. Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste. After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest.|$|E
25|$|Modigliani {{wrote to}} Ghiglia {{extensively}} from Capri, {{where his mother}} <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> to assist in his recovery from tuberculosis. These letters are a sounding board for the developing ideas brewing in Modigliani's mind. Ghiglia was seven years Modigliani's senior, {{and it is likely}} that it was he who showed the young man the limits of his horizons in Livorno. Like all precocious teenagers, Modigliani preferred the company of older companions, and Ghiglia's role in his adolescence was to be a sympathetic ear as he worked himself out, principally in the convoluted letters that he regularly sent, and which survive today.|$|E
25|$|Having {{failed to}} rally an army to retake Ambohimanga, in 1787 Andrianjafy was {{approached}} by messengers who claimed they regretted their betrayal and wished to reinstate him as king. The messengers carried him on a royal palanquin to their village in the north, using a circuitous route that disoriented him. He realized too late that the porters <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> deep into Andrianampoinimerina's territory; they bound him with rope and brought him to his nephew. Andrianampoinimerina was prepared to let his uncle go free after submitting, but the people of Ambohimanga desired vengeance for the violence and injustices the fallen king had inflicted upon them and their families. Andrianampoinimerina took a walk to distract himself while his followers carried Andrianjafy to a nearby location where he was put to death.|$|E

25|$|Carey's Squadron Leader {{had ordered}} him to cover the {{squadron}} with just three other pilots. A large number of escorting Bf 109s engaged his three-man section. Carey {{was able to get}} into firing positions several times before a Bf 110 hit him with cannon fire. The round hit the port wing and exploded the ammunition stored there, causing a large hole. The Hurricane turned onto its back and Carey noticed blood seeping from his hands and arm. He corrected the attitude of the aircraft and succeeded in attacking a flight of Bf 109s from astern and hit one but was again attacked and hit by a Bf 110 which shot off his rudder and one elevator. The fight <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> near to Cherbourg and he decided to extract himself and fly to Tangmere. The Hurricane, P3202, was later repaired. 43 Squadron's tormentors in the battle were probably from V./LG 1.|$|E
25|$|Among the few {{revisions}} Devil's Due instituted was {{the expansion}} of Cobra Commander's origin. After his brother's death, the future Commander sought out the surviving son of the family killed by Dan. He found the soldier (Snake Eyes) at a bar, where the Commander saved him from an oncoming truck and the two became friends. They traveled from state to state, acting as vigilantes. One night, Cobra Commander took Snake Eyes {{to the house of}} a corrupt Judge who he blamed for the hardships they had both experienced: years before, the judge had presided over a case involving Cobra Commander's brother Dan, who ran a veteran's hospital. The hospital had been burned down by a patient, but the judge ruled that it was insurance fraud; Dan lost everything and turned to drinking, which led to the crash that took his life and the lives of Snake Eyes' family. Realizing where his anger <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him,</b> Snake Eyes refused to kill the man and walked away. Cobra Commander killed the judge himself and vowed revenge against Snake Eyes for having turned on him.|$|E
25|$|In 1895, O'Reilly married Eleanor McCulloch {{and there}} were three {{children}} of the marriage. During his wife's illness, which lasted for many years, O'Reilly had a difficult and lonely life, which was brightened by a correspondence with a cousin in England whom he had met {{when she was a}} child. His father <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> on a visit to Europe when he was 14. His cousin was too young at the time to have any memory of him, but after the death of O'Reilly's wife in August 1914, the letters gradually developed into love-letters and in June 1917 they were married. Their letters were collected, and published in 1927 under the title of Dowell O'Reilly From his Letters, an illuminating revelation of his interesting personality. In 1920 O'Reilly made a small collection of his short stories from the Sydney Bulletin and other periodicals, and published them under the name of Five Corners. He died after a short illness of cerebrovascular disease and pneumonia at Leura in the Blue Mountains. He was survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter, afterwards Mrs Eleanor Dark, a leading Australian novelist.|$|E

25|$|In January 1941, he was {{appointed}} a flight commander of No. 41 Squadron RAF. With the squadron he flew fighter sweeps and bomber escort sorties over Nazi occupied France. On 14 August 1941, he was flying over France escorting bombers whose target was the St Omer railyards near Lille. One of the Blenheim bombers was attacked by two Messerschmitt 109 fighters. He went to its aid, shooting {{down one of the}} Messerschmitts. However, in the dogfight with the remaining Nazi fighter, his spitfire sustained damage and burst into flames. He was forced to bale out at a low altitude from his out of control aircraft. He landed safely and a French farmer immediately ushered him to a cornfield where he hid until nightfall. The farmer' son, Felix Caron, then arrived to bring him to the safety of their farm in Saint-Folquin. On 25 August 1941, his commission was confirmed and he was promoted to war substantive flying officer with seniority in that rank from 15 August 1941. After two weeks in a French Resistance safe house, the French speaking Winskill was moved down the Pat Line. He travelled to the Pyrenees and then, via Andorra, Barcelona and Madrid, to British Gibraltar. He arrived back in England in December 1941; it <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> three months to arrive back in England after being shot down.|$|E

In 1963, IBS Scouter Bro. Germain Vonderscher participated as a staff member at the 11th World Scout Jamboree in Greece, serving as a translator for visiting contingents. In 1966, IBS Scouter John Mittwer was awarded the Silver Cuckoo Distinguished Service Award by the Boy Scouts of Japan. Mittwer's work <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> to Incheon, Korea where he was instrumental in helping revive post-war Scouting in the area. Following awards of Certificates of Commendation by the Korea Scout Association in 1962, 1963 and 1965 {{he was awarded the}} first of the Korea Scout Association's distinguished service awards, also called the Silver Cuckoo, in 1966. Mittwer participated as a staff member at the 12th World Scout Jamboree in 1967 in Idaho, U.S.A. and, {{at the conclusion of the}} Jamboree and in connection with the 21st World Scout Conference held in Seattle, Washington, he was presented a Scout Friendship Certificate by the WOSM in recognition of his contribution to international Scouting. He initiated an exchange program between the Incheon District of the Korea Scout Association and the Kanagawa Council of the Boy Scouts of Japan and, in 1970, was made an Honorary Citizen of Incheon in recognition of his contribution to Scouting in that area.|$|E
500|$|Garfield was one {{of three}} {{attorneys}} who argued for the petitioners in the landmark Supreme Court case Ex parte Milligan in 1866. His clients were pro-Confederate northern men who had been found guilty and sentenced to death by a military court for treasonous activities. The case turned on whether the defendants should instead have been tried by a civilian court, and resulted in a ruling that civilians could not be tried before military tribunals while the civil courts were operating. [...] The oral argument was [...] Garfield's first court appearance. Jeremiah Black <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>him</b> in as a junior partner a year before, and assigned the case to him in light of his highly regarded oratory skills.
