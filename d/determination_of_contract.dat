40|$|ABSTRACT Monte Carlo {{simulation}} of activity networks has generated interest {{as a method}} for cost/schedule risk analysis during the design and contracting stages of large engineering projects. Commercial software for project risk analysis is now widely available as extensions to many popular project management/scheduling software packages. However, many cost and uncertainty modeling issues remain to be addressed, {{in terms of both}} practical implementation and underlying methodology. Several of these issues were examined in the course of developing a risk analysis methodology for the domain of commercial ship production. These include: statistical dependence of risk-related activities; expert elicitation of activity duration uncertainty; net present value representation for production costs, contract penalty costs, etc.; and <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> payments at project milestones.

40|$|The risk-incentive {{model of}} principal-agent {{relations}} and its extensions to infrastructural public-private partnerships outline the efficiency implications of parameters such as contract duration. The predominant focus on individual contracts is of limited use for public agencies {{that need to}} allocate their resources efficiently {{at the level of}} the entire asset network. This study therefore adopts an asset management perspective on the issue of contract duration in public-private partnership (PPP) contracts. In so doing, this research aims to add to the understanding of asset network level effects of important contractual parameters such as contract duration. Empirical material from the Netherlands illustrates that public professionals tend to think about contract duration in terms of a network cost–network control trade-off. From the data, a hierarchical set of criteria deemed relevant for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> duration is elaborated that ultimately supports network accessibility.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} of risk and rate of time preference {{in the choice of}} land contracts. The analysis builds on the risk-sharing and imperfect market explanations of contract choice. Unique data from Ethiopia, which contain land contract information and experimental risk and rate of time preference measures on matched landlord-tenant partners, are employed in the empirical analysis. The results show that landlord and tenant time preferences are significant determinants of contract choice. For landlords (but not tenants), risk preference is also significant, indicating the importance of financial constraints and production risk in the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> choice. The results are of particular relevance to land market policy in Ethiopia, where production is risk-prone, financial markets are imperfect, and where there is a major need for the development of vibrant land rental markets.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{endogenous}} <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> in a unionized oligopoly and the welfare implications thereof. Alternative contracts specify the sequencing {{in the selection}} of R&D and wages. They can be classified as 'fixed' when the unions set wages before the firms make their R&D decisions or 'floating' when the sequencing of these choices is reversed. If the unions are highly employment-oriented, we find that either all firm-union pairs choose floating-wage contracts or both contract types may coexist depending on the degree of technological spillovers. However, when the unions have stronger preference over attaining a good wage deal, then it becomes very likely that fixed-wage contracts will endogenously emerge because they can serve as an insurance device against oppor tunistic wage increases. Our welfare analysis suggests that welfare-improving contracts may nevertheless not always arise in equilibrium.

40|$|Freedom to {{contract}} and its restriction in business obligations (Summary) This thesis deals with freedom {{to contract}} and its limitations {{in the field of}} business obligations. It introduces the possibilities that parties have when entering into contracts as well as it outlines the boundaries which they cannot cross. It aspires to clarify the topic by referring to a wide scope of related judicial decisions which have evolved throughout the years. The first chapter briefly describes and classifies business obligations; hence it specifies cases in which {{freedom to contract}} and its restriction apply. The second chapter then characterizes freedom to contract and sets it to the context of other fundamental principles governing private law. It also clarifies the normative roots of this freedom and describes the nature of legal rules that can be freely deviated from in a contract. The following chapter reviews particular manifestations <b>of</b> freedom to <b>contract</b> with special focus on free <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract's</b> content. The last chapter looks into various kinds of restrictions that limit contracting parties entering into business obligations. It deals with certain issues regarding mandatory rules and mentions some formal requirements regarding legal acts.

40|$|Contract time, is {{the maximum}} time allowed for {{completion}} of all work described in contract documents.

This research performed an extensive literature review on various contract time determination procedures and systems developed and used by various state agencies to estimate contract time for their highway projects.

40|$|Under the {{objective}} theory of contract, courts interpret {{the intent of}} the parties in adopting a particular contractual term according to the reasonable meaning of that term, or the meaning that a reasonable person would assign to that term. Courts adopt {{the objective}} theory to determine all aspects of the understanding between the parties-from the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> formation, to an evaluation of the meaning of written or spoken terms, to an assessment of contract performance. In a series of articles, Professor Melvin Eisenberg explained how modern contract law evolved from the will theory to the classical model, and from the classical model to a more responsive and dynamic model. This Article argues in favor of such a progression. An objective theory of contract erroneously replaces the parties 2 ̆ 7 intent with a reasonableness standard. Reasonableness should be the product of weighing subjective intent against societal considerations, not a factor used to make such a determination. When one of the parties lacks the requisite subjective intent, a court may nevertheless enforce a contract when a failure to do so would cast doubt on the security of transactions and thus endanger our credit economy. A dynamic approach better serves a dynamic society. In the modern global and technologically driven marketplace, the objective theory of contract incompletely captures-in fact, in some cases, even undermines-contract law 2 ̆ 7 s objective of promoting individual autonomy. This Article further argues that in order for modern contract law to be truly 2 ̆ 2 dynamic, 2 ̆ 2 it must take into consideration the social and cultural backgrounds and social identities of the parties. This Article proceeds in four parts. Part I discusses the role that social identity and experience play in contract law and introduces the tension between sociocultural dissonance and an objective approach. Part II analyzes the difference that culture makes by examining a recent case involving two Korean-born businessmen. Part III analyzes the difference that gender makes by examining a case involving divorce and in vitro fertilization. This Article concludes that courts should consider contextual factors, including the background and identity of the parties, in order to better achieve the goal of contract law-to protect the reasonable expectations of the parties...|$|E

As more principals hire agents to acquire information, asset prices become less noisy. Consequently, agents {{are more willing to}} acquire information because they can forecast asset prices more accurately, thus mitigating agency problems and encouraging other principals to hire agents.

40|$|We {{explore the}} <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> debt <b>contracting</b> by testing how the {{probability}} <b>of</b> explicit <b>contracting</b> {{is related to}} amount to be borrowed and bond feature variables such as maturity, coupon, and bond ratings. Then, we {{examine the relationship between}} agency costs and contracting by comparing between two groups of bond: explicit restriction vs. implicit restriction on the sale of asset and/or sale and leaseback transaction. The probability of explicit restriction in place-is positively related to the amount of capital to be raised in support of the hypothesized relationship: the larger the amount of borrowing, the more likely an explicit restriction is to be included in debt contract. The negative coefficient for bond ratings is statistically significant in strong support of the hypothesized negative relationship between the probability <b>of</b> explicit <b>contracting</b> and bond ratings. The larger the agency costs of debt (that is, the lower the bond ratings), the more likely explicit restrictions are in place. Agency costs of debt (for which bond ratings are used as a proxy) are found to be positively related to the amount of issue and maturity, and negatively related to coupon rate and contracting variable. These positive relationships are interpreted as the size of capital to be raised by bond issue tends to be larger for the borrowing firms with lower agency costs of debt; and the longer the maturity, the higher the bond ratings, i. e. the lower agency costs of debt...|$|R

Based on some behavioral implications of performance plans which distinguish them from alternative contracts, we develop hypotheses which relate the adoption and design of a performance plan to the firm's general incentive contracting environment. We test these hypotheses using a choice-based sample, evenly divided between performance plan adopters and nonadopters. For the purposes of parameter estimation, we use the multinomial logit model to reflect the qualitative, hierarchical nature of the decision setting.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate {{the application of the}} common law rule prohibiting unilateral price <b>determination</b> in <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> sale governed by the Consumer Protection Act. The unilateral <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> price has been a controversial issue {{for an extended period of}} time. This controversy is traced back to Roman law where different translations and interpretations are given to the texts dealing with the unilateral <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> price in a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> sale. The majority of the Roman-Dutch writers preferred the view that regarded a contract granting a discretion to one of the parties to determine the price as void. Subsequently, this view was incorporated into South African law. During the 1990 s the Supreme Court of Appeal questioned whether the rule should still form part of South African law. An overview of the case law indicates that the courts have been prepared to allow contractual price discretions provided such discretions refer to an objective external standard or reasonableness. There are also indications that the courts would imply that the discretion should be exercised reasonably, except in the case of clearly unfettered discretions. Recently, the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 ("the CPA") has made substantial amendments to the law of sale in respect <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> governed by the CPA. The dissertation investigates the influence of the CPA on the rule governing unilateral price determinations in such sales. It also investigates the consumer's fundamental rights to disclosure of information and fair, just and reasonable terms and conditions. Legal uncertainties and issues arising from the provisions of the CPA are identified. Finally, a comparative study with English law is undertaken which provides a comparative basis from which possible solutions are extracted and proposals made to address the uncertainties and issues emanating from the CPA.

Content sponsoring, i. e., charging the content provider instead of viewers for resources consumed in viewing the content, can benefit all parties involved. Without being charged directly or having it counted against their monthly data quotas, end users will view more content, allowing the content provider to generate more advertising revenue, extracted by the service provider to subsidize its investment and operation of the network infrastructure. However, realizing such gains requires a proper contractual relationship between the service provider and content provider.

In the first, end users can be charged for non-sponsored views on a per-byte basis. In the second we extend the model to the more common case in which end users purchase data quotas on a periodic basis. Our main conclusion is that a coordinating contract can be designed that maximizes total system profit.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{analyzes}} the {{different points of}} view on the notion of cause (consideration) in contract in the Serbian doctrine of civil law as until the adoption of the Law on Obligations in 1978. Having in mind that the Law, adhering to the normative solutions of the French Civil Code, explicitly regulates the institution <b>of</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> as one <b>of</b> the conditions of formation and validity <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> its adoption can certainly be considered as an event of a watershed importance in respect of the analysis of various theoretical points of view on the notion <b>of</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> in the Serbian literature. The fact that the institution <b>of</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> had not been explicitly regulated in Serbian positive law as until the adoption of Law on Obligations had its effect on the evolution of doctrine in this period in two ways. On one hand, the range of differing theoretical points of view was very wide, covered as good as all the relevant streams in the doctrine of cause, from the ones accepting this institution (so-called causalistic theories) to the ones denying its legal significance in any sense (so-called anticausalistic theories). By the adoption of the Law on Obligations in 1978 the notion <b>of</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> became a legal institution in Serbian positive law that {{had a profound impact on}} the evolution of doctrine. On one hand, the cause <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> was not a neglectable legal notion any more, therefore it seems entirely logical that there is as good as no authority since then who has not dedicated to the notion <b>of</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> an article or two, or at least a separate part in their textbooks. On the other hand, the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the legislator to assign the Serbian legal system to the family of legal systems in which the notion <b>of</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is stipulated as one of conditions of formation and validity <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> led to the shrinkage of the diapason of various, often conflicting, points of view on cause <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> in the Serbian literature. In contrast to the period before the adoption of the Law on Obligations, after its adoption a tendency of abandonment of points of view disavowing any legal relevance <b>of</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> can be recognized and the majority of contemporary authorities argue that the cause <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is a necessary legal institution, although they may differ in the conceptual <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> this notion. In the period after the adoption of the Law on Obligations in the Serbian literature <b>of</b> law <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> many authorities analyzed various aspects <b>of</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> especially Professors Stojan Cigoj, Ljubiša Milošević, Živomir Đorđević, Boris Vizner, Martin Vedriš, Želimir Šmalcelj, Jakov Radišić, Slobodan Perović, Jožef Salma, Oliver Antić and others.

In particular, a plain vanilla American option is a contract between two parties concerning the possibility of selling or buying a reference asset (underlying) at a specified price (strike price). Setting the contract price and choosing the best moment for its exercise {{are two of the}} most studied problems in finance during the last 40 years. In financial markets, the behavior of the underlying is not predictable. Thus, a description of the probability law governing its stochastic evolution is necessary for the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> price and the optimal exercise decision. The majority of the existing literature focuses on mathematical and numerical procedures for computing the option price and determining the optimal exercise policy for a given law of motion of the underlying. For these purposes, only a model for the dynamics of the underlying under the risk-neutral distribution is required. When this approach is put into practice, typically a parametric model for such distribution is adopted and the parameters are calibrated on a cross-section of available option prices. On the contrary, in this PhD thesis, that summarizes the research conducted to obtain the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Economics at the University of Lugano, an econometric framework for the empirical pricing of American options is developed. In this framework, a statistical model for the dynamics of the underlying is specified by the researcher and estimated on available data. Data include both time series of relevant state variables and cross-sections of observed option prices. The estimated model is then used to estimate the price <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> that are not currently actively traded on the market. The econometric approach proposed in this thesis features three major characteristics. First, it is based on a coherent specification of both historical and risk-neutral dynamics. Second, the statistical model for the dynamics of the underlying is more general than most of the models previously considered in the literature. Third, the model parameters can be consistently estimated even when the amount of option data is limited...|$|R
