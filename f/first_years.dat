In this paper we advocate for an approach to <b>first</b> <b>year</b> curriculum design that supports <b>first</b> <b>year</b> students' transition by focusing on soft outcomes, such as building their personal resilience and self-efficacy, in addition to hard outcomes such as their academic competencies and results. Our argument draws upon current higher education curriculum design principles to propose that <b>first</b> <b>year</b> curricula in professional degrees, such as teacher education, could focus on both soft outcomes and hard outcomes in order to foster students' holistic well-being and support transition.
