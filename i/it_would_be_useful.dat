On 30 March, Đilas had returned to Partisan headquarters with 12 more Partisans that had been held in the Ustaše-run Jasenovac concentration camp. Velebit remained in Zagreb to complete a further task: he successfully arranged {{the release of a}} detained Slovenian communist, Herta Haas, who was Tito's wife and the mother of his two-year-old son, Aleksandar.|$|E
5|$|In 1766, John Gwynn {{complained in}} his work London and Westminster Improved {{that there was a}} lack of {{planning}} throughout the West End and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to construct a thoroughfare linking Marylebone Park (now Regent's Park) with the Prince Regent's Carlton House. John Fordyce was appointed as Surveyor-General to the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests in 1793 and concluded that there should be a suitable road in place by 1811, when the lease for Marylebone Park ran out and ownership reverted to the Crown. It was hoped the road could link Pall Mall and the Haymarket, of which has since declined in quality. A further problem was increased congestion around Charing Cross, which would benefit from road improvements.|$|E

Sutton based SignWriting on DanceWriting, and finally expanded the system to the complete repertoire of MovementWriting. However, only SignWriting and DanceWriting have been widely used.|$|E
25|$|Not unexpectedly, {{the idea}} came up in bureaucratic circles that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to again require a loyalty oath from all state functionaries, {{including}} university professors. Not always does history repeat itself, however, because this time a cabinet minister was able to convince the Emperor to exempt Cauchy from the oath.

25|$|In Vientiane, a Minister of State, Pra Woh, had {{rebelled against}} the ruling prince and {{fled to the}} Champasak territory, where he set himself up at Donmotdang near the present city of Ubon. He made formal {{submission}} to Siam, when he annexed Champasak, but after {{the withdrawal of the}} Thai army, he was attacked and killed by troops from Vientiane. This action was instantly regarded by King Taksin as a great insult to him, and at his command, Somdej Chao Phya Mahakasatsuek invaded Vientiane with an army of 20,000 men in 1778. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> here to briefly summarise the history of Laos which had been separated into two principalities of Luang Prabang and Vientiane {{since the beginning of the}} eighteenth century.

500|$|Angry with Deepe for airing Khánh's grievances against him, Taylor invited {{every other}} US {{journalist}} in Saigon to this private briefing. Taylor gave the journalists {{his account of}} the dispute and discussions with the generals, and hoped <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> background information for the media, so they would understand what he had done and not reach negative conclusions about his conduct in their writing. Due to the sensitivity of the situation, he asked them to keep the remarks off the record. However, someone at the briefing informed Deepe of what Taylor had said, and she published the remarks on December 25 under the title [...] "Taylor Rips Mask Off Khánh". In this article, comments were also attributed to Taylor describing some South Vietnamese officers as borderline [...] "nuts" [...] and accusing many generals of staying in Saigon and allowing their junior officers to run the war as they saw fit. Deepe's article caused an uproar due to the tension between Taylor and the Vietnamese generals.|$|E
500|$|It {{was more}} {{difficult}} for animators during the production of A Bug's Life than that of Toy Story, as computers ran sluggishly due {{to the complexity of}} the character models. Lasseter and Stanton had two supervising animators to assist with directing and reviewing the animation: Rich Quade and Glenn McQueen. The first sequence to be animated and rendered was the circus sequence that culminated with P.T. Flea's [...] "Flaming Wall of Death". Lasseter placed this scene first in the pipeline because he believed it was [...] "less likely to change". Lasseter thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to look at a view of the world from an insect's perspective. Two technicians obliged by creating a miniature video camera on Lego wheels, which they dubbed as the [...] "Bugcam". Fastened {{to the end of a}} stick, the Bugcam could roll through grass and other terrain and send back an insect's-eye outlook. Lasseter was intrigued by the way grass, leaves, and flower petals formed a translucent canopy, as if the insects were living under a stained-glass ceiling. The team also later sought inspiration from Microcosmos (1996), a French documentary on love and violence in the insect world.|$|E

500|$|Locke {{does not}} {{dedicate}} much space in Some Thoughts Concerning Education to outlining a specific curriculum; {{he is more}} concerned with convincing his readers that education is about instilling virtue and what Western educators would now call critical-thinking skills. Locke maintains that parents or teachers must first teach children how to learn and to enjoy learning. As he writes, the instructor [...] "should remember that his business is not so much to teach [...] all that is knowable, as to raise in him a love and esteem of knowledge; and to put him in the right way of knowing and improving himself." [...] But Locke does offer a few hints as to what he thinks a valuable curriculum might be. He deplores the long hours wasted on learning Latin and argues that children should first be taught to speak and write well in their native language, particularly recommending Aesop's Fables. [...] Most of Locke's recommendations are based on a similar principle of utility. So, for example, he claims that children should be taught to draw because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to them on their foreign travels (for recording the sites they visit), but poetry and music, he says, are a waste of time. Locke was also {{at the forefront of the}} scientific revolution and advocated the teaching of geography, astronomy, and anatomy. Locke's curricular recommendations reflect the break from scholastic humanism and the emergence of a new kind of education—one emphasising not only science but also practical professional training. Locke also recommended, for example, that every (male) child learn a trade. Locke's pedagogical suggestions marked the beginning of a new bourgeois ethos that would come to define Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, Conway {{developed}} {{the theory of}} surreal numbers in the reverse order of how it has been presented here. [...] He was analyzing Go endgames, and realized that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to have some way to combine the analyses of non-interacting subgames into an analysis of their disjunctive sum. [...] From this he invented {{the concept of a}} Game and the addition operator for it. [...] From there he moved on to developing a definition of negation and comparison. [...] Then he noticed that a certain class of Games had interesting properties; this class became the surreal numbers. [...] Finally, he {{developed the}} multiplication operator, and proved that the surreals are actually a field, and that it includes both the reals and ordinals.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design team}} {{had set the}} goal that the G-58 should weigh 8,750lb/3,969kg fully loaded. As {{development}} continued it became clear this was impossible to achieve as {{the structure of the}} new fighter had to be made strong enough for aircraft carrier landings. Ultimately much of the weight-saving measures included restricting the internal fuel capacity to 160gal (606l) (later 183) and limiting the fixed armament to four [...]50 cal Browning M2/AN machine guns, two in each wing. The limited range due to the reduced fuel load would mean <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in the interception role, but meant that the Hellcat would still be needed for longer range patrols. A later role was defending the fleet against airborne kamikaze attacks. Compared to the Hellcat, the Bearcat was 20% lighter, had a 30% better rate of climb and was 50mph (80km/h) faster.|$|E

2500|$|Writing {{in early}} 1945 a long essay titled [...] "Antisemitism in Britain," [...] for the Contemporary Jewish Record, Orwell stated that anti-Semitism {{was on the}} {{increase}} in Britain, {{and that it was}} [...] "irrational and will not yield to arguments." [...] He argued that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to discover why anti-Semites could [...] "swallow such absurdities on one particular subject while remaining sane on others." [...] He wrote: [...] "For quite six years the English admirers of Hitler contrived not to learn of the existence of Dachau and Buchenwald.... Many English people have heard almost nothing about the extermination of German and Polish Jews during the present war. Their own anti-Semitism has caused this vast crime to bounce off their consciousness." [...] In Nineteen Eighty-Four, written shortly after the war, Orwell portrayed the Party as enlisting anti-Semitic passions against their enemy, Goldstein.|$|E

On the Tourmalet, Wegmann and de la Fuente looked to be somewhat stronger than their two companions as they both sprinted to finish first on the top. De la Fuente won the sprint and so took the most points for the polka dot jersey, but also he won the Souvenir Jacques Goddet for coming through first {{on the top of}} the highest climb in the Pyrenees of this Tour which rendered him 5000 Euros. In the peloton, the team of [...] maintained the tempo to keep the leaders within reasonable distance and thus protect their yellow jersey. Thomas Voeckler won the sprint against Michael Rasmussen for the remaining points on top of the Tourmalet and he kept going. Although the leaders were about 4 minutes ahead at that time, he thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to go after them on his own.
