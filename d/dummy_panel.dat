In order to reach this goal, an experimental set-up is built. It consists of two tape springs connected to a ﬁxation support and a <b>dummy</b> <b>panel.</b> The data are collected through a force plate and a 3 D motion analysis system. The post-treatment of the experimental results and a comparison with a ﬁnite element model show that the Kelvin-Voigt model gives a fair approximation of the structural damping for small oscillations, however, more advanced model should be considered in future works for a better understanding in case of large displacements...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose is}} to explain the {{relation}} between the dynamics of R&D expenditures and that of exports in the four largest EU countries: France, Germany, Italy, and United Kingdom. Estimation of a fixed effects (Least Squares <b>Dummy</b> Variable) <b>panel</b> model for manufacturing as a whole and for fourteen (two digit) industries in manufacturing over the 1981 - 1992 period points out a positive and significant relation between variation in the share of R&D by each of the relevant countries on total R&D by all OECD countries and variation in the share of export by each of the relevant countries on total exports by OECD countries. In particular, this relation is stronger in Motor vehicles & equipment, Chemicals & pharmaceuticals, Mechanical engineering, Food, beverages & tobacco, paper & printing, whereas {{it turns out to be}} of scant significance for Textiles, clothing & footwear. In the light of these findings, further support is forthcoming to the hypothesis that the competitive advantage/disadvantage of nations is strongly connected to their innovative capability...|$|R
30|$|Panels C and D in Table  3 {{report the}} results with the simple-average and weighted-average mood templates. Since those two averages {{incorporate}} mood scores from both 1953 and 2007, {{they may be}} more inclusive than the results for the standalone mood score reported in Panels A and B. An important result in Panels C and D is the proportion of variation of average daily abnormal returns explained by mood as measured by the ratio of the R 2 of the mood regression to the <b>dummy</b> variable regression. <b>Panel</b> C shows that these proportions are substantial, equaling 79.1 % and 48.2 % for the EW and VW portfolios, respectively. The results in Panel D are similar but slightly weaker: 77.9 % and 45.9 %, respectively. The results in Panel C also suggest a clear trend of declining ability of mood to explain the day-of-the-week effect: the ratio of the two R 2 monotonically declines from 87.4 % in the smallest capitalization decile to 39.7 % in the largest capitalization decile. In Panel D, a similar declining trend can be seen—from 87.6 % in the smallest capitalization decile to 37.3 % in the largest capitalization decile. We conclude that the ability of mood to explain the day-of-the-week effect is substantial but declines with market capitalization.|$|R

40|$|Granivorous birds, {{mainly the}} Red-billed Quelea, have subsisted on cereal crops in Africa for centuries and have caused {{substantial}} damage. There is, however, limited recent evidence on their impact. We propose an indirect method to estimate bird-inflicted crop losses by fitting a production function with a damage abatement component and pest intensity slope <b>dummies</b> on a <b>panel</b> database of rice {{farmers in the}} Senegal River Valley. This allows us to estimate both bird damage and marginal productivity of bird control {{at different levels of}} bird pressure. Annual bird damage is found to average around 13. 2 % of the potential rice production during the wet seasons of 2003 – 2007, which translates into an average annual economic loss of 4. 7 billion FCFA (€ 7. 1 million). Our results are consistent with farmers’ perceived bird-inflicted crop losses, averaging 15. 2 %. More alarmingly, we observe declining marginal productivities of bird control under increasing bird pressure. Farmers indicate that at high bird pressure, the efficacy of traditional bird scaring methods is inadequate, which suggests that predictive (monitoring), preventive (population control) and protective (insurance) measures against massive invasions are more urgent than improving the average efficacy of curative measures (pest control). These findings are especially relevant to farmers and policy-makers who are currently struggling to implement an ambitious food self-sufficiency programme in Senegal. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Com.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2010. Very little {{research}} evidence exists {{with respect to}} the informal sector in African countries. Although (mixed) theoretical evidence does exist that postulates a relationship between formal sector employment and informal sector employment, very little is understood about the exact nature of such a relationship. The research problem to be answered by this study thus constitutes two parts: Firstly, to estimate the relationship between informal sector employment and formal sector employment in selected African countries, and, secondly, to compare and contrast the estimated coefficients for the sample of countries with respect to statistical significance, sign and magnitude of such estimated coefficients. The study makes use of a fixed effects or least squares <b>dummy</b> variable (LSDV) <b>panel</b> data regression model, in double-log form, that comprises observations for informal sector employment, formal sector employment and exports (as a possible proxy for the "trade cycle‟ effect on informal sector employment). The sample of countries includes: South Africa; Kenya; Namibia; Zambia; Botswana and Mauritius, for the study period, 1998 – 2008. Theoretically, the expectation is a negative relationship between informal sector employment and formal sector employment as these are (plausibly) "substitute‟ activities in the labour market. However, there is mixed evidence to support/negate this hypothesis. Further, the expectation is a positive relationship between informal sector employment and exports. Including formal sector employment and exports as explanatory variables in a linear regression framework, poses a possible problem of strong collinearity between the explanatory variables (i. e. multicollinearity) as formal sector employment and exports are, generally, strong positively correlated. This study uses suitable ratio transformation to remedy this problem. The general findings of the study are that South Africa, Namibia and Mauritius had statistically significant levels (or average changes therein) of informal employment as a proportion of population not dependent on changes to formal employment as a proportion of population and exports. In Namibia and Zambia, informal employment as a proportion of population was statistically related to formal employment as a proportion of population, with negative sign, and "elasticity‟ greater than 1. In Namibia and Mauritius, informal employment as a proportion of population was statistically related to exports. Namibia had a positive sign and "elasticity‟ barely in excess of 1. Mauritius, however, had a negative sign and "elasticity‟ greater than 1...|$|R
