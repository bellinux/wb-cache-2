40|$|Ink trappings {{were studied}} by using {{polyethylene}} terephthalate (PET) film with black inks for offset proofing and synthetic paper. By observing printed matter from reverse side through the PET film, we detected many air bubbles in <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> layer and between <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> layer and <b>the</b> PET film. They are classified roughly to two groups, {{small number of}} large ones (φ = 2 - 5 μm) and many small ones (φ = 0. 5 - 1. 0 μm). The former ones were fixed air bubbles during the trapping. The latter ones decreased according to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> amount of <b>ink</b> trapped (y). Because number of the air bubbles (Nair bubble) <b>increased</b> with <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> distribution time, {{they seemed to be}} yielded by suspension of air into <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> layer during ink distribution. By observing printed surface, we also detected many ink peaks (immediately after the trapping) and pinholes (at 24 h). The numbers of <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> peaks and pinholes (Nink peak and Npinhole, respectively) decreased also with <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> y value and <b>increased</b> with <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> distribution time. We studied effects of nip width on these values (distribution time = 2 min.; nip width = 2, 3 and 4 mm). The Nair bubble value decreased with increasing nip width contrary to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> Nink peak and Npinhole values. The effects can be represented by differences in the values of 2 and 4 mm nip widths.

40|$|Conventional four-color {{printing}} systems {{are limited by}} a relative small color gamut, poor color constancy, and a high degree metamerism. In this dissertation, these problems were addressed by <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> number, optimizing <b>the</b> spectral <b>ink</b> curves, and <b>the</b> lookup tables for multiple-ink printing. First, a computer simulation was performed to investigate the optimum combinations of different ink number to maximize the color gamut for halftoning printing. By analyzing the color gamuts achieved by real ink sets and virtual <b>ink</b> sets, <b>the</b> conclusions were drawn that the color gamut can be improved by increasing ink number and optimizing spectral ink curves. Second, an investigation of color inconstancy on several ink-jet printers showed that the color inconstancy could be a serious problem for some printers. A computer simulation was performed to investigate optimal ink sets to minimize color inconstancy while maintaining a large color gamut. <b>The</b> relationship between <b>ink</b> shape and <b>the</b> color constancy of prints was analyzed. The {{results show that the}} center wavelength and width of an ink spectral curve are very important for the color constancy of prints. When <b>the</b> number of <b>inks</b> exceeds three, there is the usual color-management one-to-many mapping problem. In order to further solve the color inconstancy problem, an algorithm was developed for multi-ink printing in which the one-to-many mapping problem was overcome by selecting <b>ink</b> combinations with <b>the</b> best color constancy. The algorithm was evaluated on both real and virtual <b>ink</b> sets. <b>The</b> results proved that the new color separation algorithm can improve color constancy, significantly. Therefore, color constancy can be improved by both ink design and lookup table creation. Third, in order to make printed reproductions that match original artwork under different illuminants, an optimization strategy was developed to optimize ink sets to minimize the spectral error between reproduction and artwork paints. The results showed that as <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> number <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> accuracy of spectral reproduction improved. A different optimization was performed for minimizing the degree metamerism from illuminant D 50 to Fl 1 and from D 65 to A.

For inkjet printing, the viscosity and surface tension of ink are major factors that affect the quality of ink-jet printing. In order to obtain a better print quality, the samples of five different viscosity and surface tension of ink were prepared respectively by changing the content of the resin and the surface active agent. Using these samples to print on the fabric by Epson printer, and to discuss the influence of <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> in different viscosity and surface tension on the ink-jet printing quality, such as apparent color depth (K / S), color parameters (L, C), permeability, clarity.

Previous research has found that the three parameters, spectral reflectance of <b>the</b> <b>ink,</b> solid ink density level and screening method, all influence the gamut in process color printing. This thesis evaluated how much these parameters change the color gamut both as individual parameters and in combination. A test target with 168 patches in the most saturated combinations of cyan, magenta, yellow and black was printed and measured with a spectrophotometer. The three coordinates L*, a* and b* for each patch in the target was plotted in the CIELAB space. Connecting these points forms a three dimensional object, the color gamut volume. By calculating the volume of this object the number of CIELAB combinations that can be reproduced in the system was derived.

40|$|Abstract: The hard roller {{and soft}} roller are {{alternately}} arranged in <b>the</b> <b>inking</b> system of offset press. <b>The</b> <b>ink</b> vibrator {{is a hard}} roller which transmits the motion to <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> distributing roller. In order to analyze the motion mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> roller, a model of an ink distributing roller and an ink vibrator is built up by using the software ANSYS. After the simulation of the motion, the force on the contact area of <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> distributing roller and the rotation speed of both rollers are analyzed. The result is that <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> distributing roller rotates with tangential force on the contact area and this force <b>increases</b> together with <b>the</b> rotation speed. When the two rollers rotate, the tangential elastic deformation {{is caused by the}} tangential force on contact area, and the radial deformation of <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> distributing roller is caused by the pressure. It leads to a relative sliding of the two rollers, which is mainly influenced by the rotation speed of <b>ink</b> vibrator and <b>the</b> radial deformation of ink distributing roller. Meanwhile, to verify the accuracy of the analysis, the rotation speed of the two rollers and the deformation of <b>the</b> <b>ink</b> distributing roller have been measured on a printability tester and then compared with the results of simulation. The analysis of the motion mechanism is very important to the study of printing color quality control...|$|R

40|$|Proliferation of {{pancreatic}} islet β cells {{is an important}} mechanism for self-renewal and for adaptive islet expansion. <b>Increased</b> expression of <b>the</b> <b>Ink</b> 4 a/Arf locus, which encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 16 INK 4 a and tumor suppressor p 19 Arf, limits β-cell regeneration in aging mice, but the basis of β-cell Ink 4 a/Arf regulation is poorly understood. Here we show that Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh 2), a histone methyltransferase and component of a Polycomb group (PcG) protein complex, represses Ink 4 a/Arf in islet β cells. Ezh 2 levels decline in aging islet β cells, and this attrition coincides with reduced histone H 3 trimethylation at Ink 4 a/Arf, and increased levels of p 16 INK 4 a and p 19 Arf. Conditional deletion of β-cell Ezh 2 in juvenile mice also reduced H 3 trimethylation at <b>the</b> <b>Ink</b> 4 a/Arf locus, leading to precocious increases of p 16 INK 4 a and p 19 Arf. These mutant mice had reduced β-cell proliferation and mass, hypoinsulinemia, and mild diabetes, phenotypes rescued by germline deletion of Ink 4 a/Arf. β-Cell destruction with streptozotocin in controls led to increased Ezh 2 expression that accompanied adaptive β-cell proliferation and re-establishment of β-cell mass; in contrast, mutant mice treated similarly failed to regenerate β cells, resulting in lethal diabetes. Our discovery of Ezh 2 -dependent β-cell proliferation revealed unique epigenetic mechanisms underlying normal β-cell expansion and β-cell regenerative failure in diabetes pathogenesis...|$|R
