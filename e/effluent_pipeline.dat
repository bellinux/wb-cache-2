40|$|Profiles of 241 Am, 137 Cs, 238 Pu, 239240 pu & 24 lPu {{have been}} studied in four cores {{collected}} from the Ravenglass saltmarsh, Cumbria and one core collected from the Irish Sea, near the <b>effluent</b> <b>pipeline</b> of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant. Major and trace elements have also been measured {{to look at the}} effects of sediment composition and any redox controls on element redistribution. In addition, almost one hundred surface scrape samples were collected from the Ravenglass saltmarsh and the same radionuclides were measured to study the lateral distribution of radionuclides. Three of the Ravenglass cores have well preserved the history of Sellafield discharge since the plant became operational in 1952. There are no significant post depositional processes and redox changes for all the cores studied. However, one of the saltmarsh cores collected {{from the front of the}} marsh shows that surface erosion has occurred. Surface scrape sample results also show that erosion is a significant process which results in the redistribution of sediments within the marsh. The core collected from the Irish Sea adjacent to the <b>effluent</b> <b>pipeline</b> shows sediment mixing has operated and these mixed sediments are the main source of material to the saltmarsh. Using the Sellafield discharge records from 1952 onwards, sediment mixing rates have been estimated using a simple mathematical model and they are inferred to be between 80 % and 90 %. Isotopic ratios of Pu isotopes have been compared to those estimated ratios corresponding to particular sediment mixing rates and show good agreement up to 30 cm below the surface. There is less correlation between Sellafield discharge ratios and measured ratios in cores below 30 cm and this may be due to unreliable discharge data or more likely the advective redistribution of material in the saltmarsh. A contribution of 241 Am originating from the decay of 24 IPu in cores was determined. The ingrown 241 Am contributes significantly to the total 241 Am measured. Based on the Sellafield discharge record, it is estimated that approximately 46 % of total 24 IAm in the system has originated from the decay of 241 Pu discharged from the plant since 1952. Spatial distribution of radionuclides in the Ravenglass saltmarsh is controlled by sediment accumulation associated with tidal inundation frequency and the clay content in the sediments. Surface erosion also plays a major role in redistributing saltmarsh sediment labelled with older Sellafield discharge within the marsh together with the sediments originated from the River Esk...|$|E

50|$|The Damanganga River {{downstream}} of Vapi {{up to its}} confluence {{with the}} sea is polluted from the effluents emerging from the industrial and domestic wastes of the Vapi town, Silvassa, Daman and Kachigaon. According to the Central Pollution Control Board's report the BOD value recorded at its monitoring station downstream of Kachogaon was a high of 30 mgl per liter. According to a study report of the Machhimar Adhikar Rahstriya Abhiyan due to the industrial effluents from the Vapi town the dissolved oxygen level is very low ar 0.1-mg/1 and Mercury content in the groundwater in the town is about ninety six {{times higher than the}} standards prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Untreated effluents are directly discharged into the Damanganga and Kolak Rivers. This has resulted in pollution of the sea water to a limit of five nautical miles seriously affecting fish life.

40|$|From November of 1973 to May of 1974, 15 {{arrays of}} {{sediment}} traps were placed along 33 km of southern Lake Champlain {{to sample the}} distribution of effluent from a large paper plant located on the western shore which had commenced operation in 1971. In the arrays located near the <b>effluent</b> diffuser <b>pipeline</b> as much as 2. 3 cm of sediment accumulated, whereas elsewhere in the lake less than 1 cm accumulated. In the area of accelerated accumulation, sediments contained high concentrations of several components used in or derived from paper manufacturing. Values for kaolinite, expressed as the ratio of kaolinite to chlorite, for example, were as high as 1. 4, anatase (TiO 2) concentrations were as high as 0. 8 %, organic carbon 8. 7 %, and phosphorus 254 µg/g; all were more abundant than in sediments collected in traps to the south or north. In surficial bottom sediments collected near each array organic carbon and phosphorus were also higher (4. 2 % and 127 µg/g respectively) near the diffuser than elsewhere.

40|$|Current geochemical and {{geophysical}} injectate tracking {{methods are}} useful reservoir management techniques {{but do not}} track injectate movement quick enough to maximize injection efficiency or avoid negative impacts on nearby steam production wells. A preliminary analysis indicates that two dimensional electrical resistance tomography (ERT) may be useful for imaging plume movement resulting from Geysers/Lake County <b>Effluent</b> <b>Pipeline</b> injectate in near real time. ERT models comparing an injection plume resistivity of 50 Ohm-m with background resistivities of 10, 100 (typical Geysers greywacke), and 500 Ohm-m (typical Geysers felsite) indicate that liquid plumes can be imaged at depths of 6, 000 feet to 8, 000 feet or greater for resistivity contrasts of 2 to 1 or greater. Further refinement of the ERT model could be accomplished with more data on porosity {{in the vicinity of}} the borehole, resistivity measurements, and reservoir engineering estimates of plume temperature and saturation. Based on the results of this analysis and previous successes in using ERT to map shallow subsurface steam and water movement in porous media it is likely, but not certain, that ERT will prove to be an additional reservoir management tool to be used in conjunction with additional geochemical, geophysical, and reservoir engineering techniques. A field scale test at The Geysers is required to verify the utility of ERT for injectate tracking. The goal of this paper is to stimulate discussion among geothermal researchers regarding use of the ERT technique for injectate tracking at The Geysers and get some input on the appropriateness and utility of the assumptions used...|$|E

Of the commonly found species (blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) and common periwinkle (Littorina littorea)), mussels were found to be the most highly enriched in 14 C due to the surface environment they inhabit and their feeding behaviour. Whole mussel shell activities appear to have been decreasing in response to reduced discharge activities since the early 2000 s but in contrast, there is evidence of continuing enrichment of the carbonate sediment component due to in-situ shell erosion, as well as indications of particle transport of fine 14 C-enriched material close to Sellafield...|$|R

40|$|Effluent streams {{from the}} Modular Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU) will {{transfer}} to the tank farms and to the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). These streams will contain entrained solvent. A {{significant portion of the}} Strip <b>Effluent</b> (SE) <b>pipeline</b> (i. e., acid stream containing Isopar{reg_sign} L residues) length is within one inch of a sludge stream. Personnel envisioned the sludge stream temperature may reach 100 C during operation. The nearby SE stream may receive heat from the sludge stream and reach temperatures that may lead to flammability issues once the contents of the SE stream discharge into a larger reservoir. To this end, personnel used correlations from the literature to estimate the maximum temperature rise the SE stream may experience if the nearby sludge stream reaches boiling temperature. Several calculation methods were used to determine the temperature rise of the SE stream. One method considered a heat balance equation under steady state that employed correlation functions to estimate heat transfer rate. This method showed the maximum temperature of the acid stream (SE) may exceed 45 C when the nearby sludge stream is 80 C or higher. A second method used an effectiveness calculation used to predict the heat transfer rate in single pass heat exchanger. By envisioning the acid and sludge pipes as a parallel flow pipe-to-pipe heat exchanger, this method provides a conservative estimation of the maximum temperature rise. Assuming the contact area (i. e., the area over which the heat transfer occurs) is the whole pipe area, the results found by this method nearly matched the results found with the previous calculation method. It is recommended that the sludge stream be maintained below 80 C to minimize a flammable vapor hazard from occurring...|$|R
40|$|The {{nuclear energy}} {{industry}} produces radioactive waste {{at various stages}} of the fuel cycle. In the United Kingdom, spent fuel is reprocessed at the Sellafield facility (formerly known as Windscale), in Cumbria on the north-west coast of England. Waste generated at the site comprises {{a wide range of}} radionuclides, including radiocarbon (14 C) which, due to its long half-life (5730 years), environmental mobility and high bio-availability, is the largest contributor to collective dose commitment from the entire nuclear industry. 14 C is disposed of in various forms, one of which is as highly soluble inorganic carbon within the low-level liquid radioactive <b>effluent,</b> via <b>pipelines,</b> into the Irish Sea. The discharged 14 C is then rapidly incorporated into the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) pool. This project aimed to better understand the fate of Sellafield discharges of 14 C to the marine environment. Investigations of intertidal sites in the Irish Sea and West of Scotland found 14 C enrichment above ambient background levels in shell material, including at the most northerly site, located 265 km north of Sellafield. Dissolved inorganic 14 C is readily utilised during shell formation by calcifying organisms and mussel shell 14 C activities at sites closer to Sellafield appear to be varying in response to the total Sellafield 14 C discharge activity over the preceding 5 years. Due to subsequent erosion of this material, 14 C is transferred to finer fractions of intertidal sediments where it is accumulating. During photosynthesis, primary producing organisms also utilise carbon derived from the DIC pool. This uptake and the trophic-level transfer of 14 C within the Irish Sea and West of Scotland marine environments were examined. The 14 C activities of Irish Sea DIC and biota in the east and west basins were enriched and highly variable. A general decrease in 14 C activity with distance from Sellafield was observed, although, enriched activities were also found in the West of Scotland where the activities were more homogenous. Organic sediments were significantly less enhanced than associated benthic organisms. This could be due to rapid scavenging of labile, 14 C-enriched organic material by organisms and mixing to depth with older, 14 C depleted material. Commercially important species were 14 C enriched; however, the radiation dose from their consumption is extremely low and radiologically insignificant. To evaluate the transfer of 14 C to top predators in the UK marine environment, 14 C activities were examined in stranded marine mammals. All Irish Sea samples were enriched, as were most from the West of Scotland, although the 14 C activities were lower. In demonstrating transfer of enriched 14 C to apex predators for the first time, this study also showed that marine mammal activities correlated significantly with distance from Sellafield and Sellafield 14 C discharge activities for 24 months prior to stranding. These measurements also provided some insight into harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) ecology, indicating high foraging fidelity and suggesting the animals stranded on the West of Scotland did not forage in the Irish Sea. The studies in this thesis examined the dispersion of Sellafield-derived 14 C to both near- and far-field sites and the subsequent ecosystem uptake and trophic transfer at these locations. However, it is important to attempt to understand the fate of 14 C discharges beyond the limitations and scope of analytical investigations. To do so, the first spatial-temporal ecosystem model to predict the ecological fate of Sellafield-derived 14 C was developed. The observed trends in 14 C activities between different species were predicted by the model which illustrated the integration of 14 C in species at higher trophic levels through time...|$|R
