I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals." ...|$|E

"Also I pray {{another thing}} of you--that {{if you think}} I have any wisdom, or any little light in the lamp of this ugly, old body of mine, you will always take me for a counsellor, and write to me {{concerning}} your troubles, (as indeed, you must do, for remember I am your trustee of this property,) and perhaps {{pay attention to the}} advice I may give.

My mother wanted much to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> own Queen, but the approaches to the Louvre were watched lest she should communicate with the Regent; and we were cut off from her till M. Darpent gave his word for us, and obtained for us a pass. And, oh! it was a sad sight to see the great courts and long galleries left all dreary and empty. It made me think of Whitehall and of Windsor, though we little knew that at that very time there was worse there than even desolation.|$|E

"Here we are posted," [...] says he, [...] "you by accident, and I {{by my own}} choice, {{in a part of}} {{the world}} very remote from our own country; but it is in a country where, by us who {{understand}} trade and business, a great deal of money is to be got: if you will put a thousand pounds to my thousand pounds, we will hire a ship here, the first we can <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> minds; you shall be captain, I'll be merchant, and we will go a trading voyage to China; for what should we stand still for?

I know them," [...] he said to O'Driscol, as the regiment was dismissed from parade. [...] "They will not fall out, they will not straggle, but if they come to a place where wine's in plenty, they will make bastes of themselves; and after all," [...] he added, [...] "after the work they have gone through, who is to blame them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We had cursed our luck,' says Barnet, 'that {{we could}} not <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> {{quarters}} at Alkmaar that night. There, we were told, were provisions, tobacco, and everything for which we craved. But the main canal from Zaandam and Amsterdam was hopelessly jammed with craft, and we were glad of a chance opening that enabled us {{to get out of}} the main column and lie up in a kind of little harbour very much neglected and weedgrown before a deserted house. We broke into this and found some herrings in a barrel, a heap of cheeses, and stone bottles of gin in the cellar; and with this I cheered my starving men. We made fires and toasted the cheese and grilled our herrings. None of us had slept for nearly forty hours, and I determined to stay in this refuge until dawn and then if the traffic was still choked leave the barge and march the rest of the way into Alkmaar.|$|E

Everyone says those rascally Saints are at the bottom of it. We must hide our trail as much as we can. We are just {{at the edge of the}} bad lands, and will travel on them for the next two days. The red-skins don't go out that way much, there being nothing either to hunt or to plunder, so there is little fear of their coming on our trail on the bare rocks, especially as none of the horses are shod. On the third day we shall strike right up into their mountains." ...|$|E

6000|$|During my {{stay here}} many {{proposals}} {{were made for}} my return to England, but none falling out to my mind, the English merchant who lodged with me, and whom I had contracted an intimate acquaintance with, came to me one morning, saying: [...] "Countryman, I have a project to communicate, which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, for aught I know, suit with yours also, when you shall have thoroughly considered it. Here we are posted, you by accident and I by my own choice, {{in a part of}} the world very remote from our own country; but it is in a country where, by us who understand trade and business, a great deal of money is to be got.

It seems to me that all have lost their heads--one gives one counsel, and one gives another. Never did I see such faint hearts. The lord mayor has been with the king. He speaks bravely as far as he himself and the better class of {{citizens}} are concerned, but they are overborne by the commonalty, who favour the rabble partly because they hope to gain by the disorder, and partly because the leaders of the rabble declare that they will slay all the council, and, above all, the Duke of Lancaster, against whom many in the city, as well as in the country, have a deep grudge." ...|$|E

It may be that, as one grows older, one acquires more and more the painful consciousness of the difference between what ought to be done and what can be done, and sits down more quietly when one gets the wrong side of fifty, to let others start up to do for us things we cannot do for ourselves. But it is the highest pleasure that a man can have who has (to his own exceeding comfort) turned down the hill at last, to believe that younger spirits will rise up after him, and catch the lamp of Truth, as in the old lamp-bearing race of Greece, out of his hand before it expires, and carry it on to the goal with swifter and more even feet.|$|E
