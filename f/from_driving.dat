5|$|First-series scenes {{featuring}} Fry driving an Alvis TE 21 {{were placed}} in jeopardy when the actor was caught speeding in May 2006.

The first two episodes were directed by Robin Sheppard, {{the third and fourth}} by Metin Hüseyin and the final two by Sandy Johnson.

5|$|Like {{all other}} US states, New Jersey sets a 0.08 percent {{weight by volume}} blood alcohol content (BAC) as the {{threshold}} for intoxication when operating a motor vehicle (e.g. automobile, boat). It is possible {{to be charged with}} driving under the influence (DUI) with a BAC level below 0.08%, but there is a presumption in that situation that the driver is not intoxicated. State law prohibits those under 21 <b>from</b> <b>driving</b> if their BAC is 0.01% or more, prohibits the operation of a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or more, and mandates that drivers submit a breath sample if requested by a police officer. To be convicted of DUI in New Jersey, a person must be operating or attempting to operate a motorized vehicle; thus activities such as sleeping in a car while intoxicated or bicycling while drunk are not illegal.|$|E

30|$|From the {{attenuation}} coefficient α shown in Table  2, the resistive {{loss in the}} 150 MHz case is larger than that in the 13.56 MHz case. However, the resistive loss only causes a monotonic decay in voltage amplitude <b>from</b> the <b>driving</b> point along the wave-propagation direction. Since Figure 5 does not show a monotonic decay in voltage <b>from</b> the <b>driving</b> point, the drastic change in the voltage pattern in the 150 MHz case {{is considered to be}} caused mainly by the standing wave effect.|$|R
