5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the Greek Allies were {{persuaded by}} the Athenian general Themistocles {{to bring the}} Persian fleet to battle again, {{in the hope that}} a victory would prevent naval {{operations}} against the Peloponnese. The Persian king Xerxes was also <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> decisive battle. As a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the Persian navy rowed into the Straits of Salamis and tried to block both entrances. In the cramped conditions of the Straits, the great Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganized. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2003, Laurer had {{a tumultuous}} {{relationship}} with fellow wrestler Sean Waltman. They were engaged {{for a period}} in 2003, then broke up, and then became engaged again, a pattern that continued {{for the next two}} years. In 2004, Laurer and Waltman made a sex tape. <b>Eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> repeat success, the company that released Paris Hilton's celebrity sex tape obtained the footage, edited it, and released it under the name 1 Night in China. The video sold over 100,000 copies, with both Laurer and Waltman earning a share of the profits. Laurer, however, maintained that she did not earn any money from the release. In January 2005, Laurer was arrested for domestic assault after allegedly beating Waltman.|$|E

5|$|Newman's {{great success}} at ABC had been {{noted by the}} British Broadcasting Corporation, whose {{executives}} were keen to revive their own drama department's fortunes {{in the face of}} fierce competition from ITV. In 1961 the BBC's Director of Television, Kenneth Adam, met with Newman and offered him the position of Head of Drama at the BBC. He accepted the position, <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new challenge, although he was forced by ABC to remain with them until the expiration of his contract in December 1962, after which he immediately began work with the BBC.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{looked to}} further Valois {{interests}} by grand dynastic marriages. In 1570, Charles IX married Elisabeth of Austria, daughter of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. Catherine was also <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> match between {{one of her}} two youngest sons and Elizabeth I of England. After Catherine's daughter Elisabeth died in childbirth in 1568, she had touted her youngest daughter Margaret as a bride for Philip II of Spain. Now she sought a marriage between Margaret and Henry III of Navarre, Jeanne' son, {{with the aim of}} uniting Valois and Bourbon interests. Margaret, however, was secretly involved with Henry of Guise, the son of the late Duke of Guise. When Catherine found this out, she had her daughter brought from her bed. Catherine and the king then beat her, ripping her nightclothes and pulling out handfuls of her hair.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Ann Romney {{learned that}} she had {{multiple}} sclerosis; Mitt described watching her fail a series of neurological tests as {{the worst day of}} his life. After experiencing two years of severe difficulties with the disease, she found– while living in Park City, Utah, where the couple had built a vacation home– a combination of mainstream, alternative, and equestrian therapies that enabled her to lead a lifestyle mostly without limitations. When her husband received a job offer to take over the troubled organization responsible for the 2002 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, to be held in Salt Lake City in Utah, she urged him to accept it; <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new challenge, as well as another chance to prove himself in public life, he did. On February 11, 1999, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002 hired Romney as its president and CEO.|$|E

5|$|The besiegers {{became aware}} of this, and, unlike the Byzantines, the Angevin commanders were <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> decisive confrontation. At this point, Sully {{resolved}} to reconnoitre the area personally, accompanied only by a bodyguard of 25 men. As he approached the Byzantine camp, he fell into an ambush by Turkish mercenaries serving in the Byzantine army. The Turks attacked the small troop, killed Sully's horse, scattered his guard, and captured him. A few of Sully's guards escaped and reached their camp, where they reported his capture. Panic spread among the Angevin troops at this news, {{and they began to}} flee towards Valona. The Byzantines took advantage of their disordered flight and attacked, joined by the troops in the besieged citadel. Many Latins fell, many others were captured as the Byzantines aimed their arrows at the less well-protected horses of the Latin knights, unhorsing them. The Byzantines also took an enormous booty, including all the numerous siege machines. Only a small remnant managed to cross the river Vjosë and reach the safety of Kanina.|$|E
5|$|The first Quatermass film {{had been}} a major success for Hammer and, <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sequel, they {{purchased}} the rights to Nigel Kneale's follow-up before the BBC had even begun transmission of the new serial. For this adaptation, Nigel Kneale himself was allowed to write {{the first draft of}} the screenplay, although subsequent drafts were worked on by director Val Guest. The plot is a condensed but largely faithful retelling of the original television serial. The main difference between the two versions is at the climax: in the television version Quatermass blasts off in a rocket to confront the aliens in outer space, whereas in the film the rocket is fired, unmanned, to destroy the aliens' asteroid base. Returning director Val Guest once again employed many cinema vérité techniques to present the fantastic elements of the plot with the greatest degree of realism. Nigel Kneale was critical of the final film, mainly on account of the return of Brian Donlevy in the lead role. Kneale was unhappy with Donlevy's interpretation of the character and also claimed the actor's performance was marred by his alcoholism, a claim denied by Val Guest.|$|E
5|$|When Atkinson {{arrived at}} Fort Armstrong on Rock Island on April 12, {{he learned that}} the British Band was in Illinois, and that most of the Meskwakis he wanted to arrest were now with the band. Like other American officials, Atkinson was {{convinced}} that the British Band intended to start a war. Because he had few troops at his disposal, Atkinson hoped to get support from the Illinois state militia. He wrote to Governor Reynolds on April 13, describing—and perhaps purposely exaggerating—the threat that the British Band posed. Reynolds, who was <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> war to drive the Indians out of the state, responded as Atkinson had hoped: he called for militia volunteers to assemble at Beardstown by April 22 to begin a thirty-day enlistment. The 2,100 men who volunteered were organized into a brigade of five regiments under Brigadier General Samuel Whiteside. Among the militiamen was 23-year-old Abraham Lincoln, who was elected captain of his company.|$|E
60|$|William, on {{the other}} hand, was {{naturally}} <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> early engagement. He was still very insecurely seated upon the English throne. The people were either discontented or indifferent. They looked with impatience and indignation at the crowd of Dutch officers and civilians, whom William had brought over with him; while the cold and ungracious manner of the king contrasted, most unfavourably, with the bearing to {{which they had been}} accustomed in English monarchs.|$|R
5000|$|Brad Adams, Asia {{director}} at Human Rights Watch has said, [...] "The government is {{fully aware of}} the abductions but allows them to happen because it's <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ally against the Tamil Tigers". The Human Rights Watch further added that {{it would be impossible to}} transport abducted children without the complicity of the Sri Lankan Army. TMVP has allegedly been used as a paramilitary force by the Sri Lankan army, from the time the group split from the LTTE in 2004.|$|R
50|$|By midday, {{the action}} had {{shifted to the}} center of the Confederate line. Sumner had {{accompanied}} the morning attack of Sedgwick's division, but another of his divisions, under French, lost contact with Sumner and Sedgwick and inexplicably headed south. <b>Eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to see combat, French found skirmishers in his path and ordered his men forward. By this time, Sumner's aide (and son) located French, described the terrible fighting in the West Woods and relayed <b>an</b> order <b>for</b> him to divert Confederate attention by attacking their center.|$|R

25|$|As head of Central Command, Mattis {{oversaw the}} wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and was {{responsible}} for a region that includes Syria, Iran, and Yemen.

25|$|At the {{election}} of the Sheriffs of London in July 1682, the Tory candidates prevailed. Shaftesbury was worried that these Sheriffs would be able to fill juries with Tory supporters and he was desperately afraid of another prosecution for high treason. Shaftesbury, therefore began discussions with Monmouth, Russell, and Grey to launch co-ordinated rebellions {{in different parts of the}} country. Shaftesbury was much more <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rebellion than the other three, and the uprising was postponed several times, to Shaftesbury's chagrin.|$|E
5000|$|Yet, {{given the}} status of young adults as minors, many topics of {{interest}} to them, such as homosexuality,are controversial. As Nancy St. Clair describes in her article: [...] "Adults have been eager to have the genre moralize, to perform a social service, while the adolescent has been <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> understanding of society and his/her emerging, if continuing sexuality. Still, the decade beginning with the mid-1970s and running to the mid-1980s saw {{the publication of a}} second category of novels, ones in which the representation of adolescent homosexuality became increasingly complex and decreasingly moralistic." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{signing of}} a final peace {{agreement}} was greatly expected by the Guatemalan population. Thousands of people attended this signing ceremony, which was held {{in front of the}} National Palace and projected on large screens in the main square. The accords were well anticipated and agreed upon by Guatemalans, as the population was <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> end to the thirty-six years of war. However, there was hesitation due to expected failure in the implementation of the accords. A poll conducted by Prensa Libre, a national newspaper, showed that 78% of respondents agreed with the accords but only 38% believed these peace negotiations [...] "would be respected".|$|R
25|$|The Grand Cherokee thus {{became the}} first Chrysler-badged Jeep product. Development work for the new Jeep model {{continued}} and Chrysler's employees (after the 1987 buyout of AMC) were <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> late-1980s release date; however, CEO Lee Iacocca was pushing for redesigned Chrysler minivans, thus delaying the Grand Cherokee's release until late-1992 as an Explorer competitor. Unlike the Explorer, the Grand Cherokee utilized monocoque (unibody) construction, whereas the Explorer was a derivative of the Ranger pickup with a separate body-on-frame.|$|E
25|$|An {{employee}} of Bake, W. C. Brade, continued his plans, although {{he changed the}} route to run from Amsterdam to Rotterdam, with the original stretch running to Haarlem to test its economic viability. This change in route may have been partly influenced by wealthy investors who were <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> direct train connection between either of the great Dutch ports (Amsterdam and Rotterdam). King William I was reluctant to have the Netherlands at a competitive disadvantage to the neighbouring countries who were all building railroads. He might also have felt threatened by {{the plans for the}} Iron Rhine.|$|E
25|$|Back on Earth, she {{encounters}} {{the assassin}} Lobo. Initially <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> peaceful resolution, seeing {{a kind of}} kinship with him in their both being lone survivors of their respective worlds (although not truly aware of Lobo's circumstances), Kara's encounter with the Czarnian would reveal deep mental wounds, resulting in the unleashing of her rage and transformation into a Red Lantern. Driven insane by rage, Kara wanders space, attacking everyone in her way, until captured by several Green Lanterns and brought to Hal Jordan. Immediately recognizing a Kryptonian and unable to remove the power ring without killing her, he brings her to Guy Gardner, the leader {{of one of the}} two Red Lantern factions, who manages to restore her sanity.|$|E
50|$|Sultan Njoya {{welcomed the}} first German {{emissary}} to the Bamum kingdom in 1902 after {{hearing of the}} ruthless treatment given rebellious tribes further to the northwest. He even lent military support for the German campaign against the Nso near Bamenda in 1906. The Bamum soldiers, <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> revenge <b>for</b> <b>an</b> earlier defeat to the Nso in 1888, committed such atrocities that the Germans sent them back. Njoya also ordered {{the building of a}} palace at Foumban in 1917, which he modeled after that of the German governor.|$|R
50|$|The use {{of crude}} {{language}} by Putin aroused the Russian public, already <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> revenge. <b>A</b> poll by VTsIOM on 27 September 1999 revealed a considerable hardening of public opinion.

25|$|There {{were other}} {{problems}} that a pope {{would have to}} face. Queen Elizabeth of England had been excommunicated by Pius V, and she had obtained possession of Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary's relatives, the Guises, were {{the leaders of the}} devout hyper-Catholic party in France, who were <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> show-down with the Huguenots. Catherine de Medicis was attempting to avoid a civil war in France, and she believed that the marriage of her daughter Margot with Henri of Navarre, a Protestant, might avert disaster but dispensations would be required of the pope. She was also trying to tempt Queen Elizabeth into marriage with her son, Henri, and that would require papal cooperation as well. Her choices were the Cardinal of Ferrara, Ippolito d'Este, who was as disliked in 1572 as he had been in 1549. His collection of enemies had grown to include Cardinals Bonelli, Borromeo, Farnese, Medici, and Morone. Catherine, however, was in contact with her cousin, Cosimo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who, behind the scenes, was promoting Cardinal Boncompagni. Cardinal de' Medici was to inform the leaders of the Faction of Pius IV, Borromeo and Altemps, that the Medici were interested only in Sirleto and Boncompagni. With the French and Florentine votes, in fact, Cardinal d'Este had the resources to block any candidate he pleased (the 'virtual veto').|$|E
25|$|In 1480, Heinrich von Gundelfingen {{collected}} {{a number of}} local legends into {{a book called the}} Herkommen der Schwyzer und Oberhasler (Traditions of the Schwyzer and Oberhasler) which claimed that the land had been settled by 6,000 Swedes and 1,200 East Frisians after they rescued the Pope from a barbarian attack in 400 AD. The central elements of the myth, the Swedish origin and the rescue of the Pope became central elements in the Schwyzer state mythos. By 1531, this special relationship to the Catholic faith and the Pope was specifically mentioned in a resolution that passed in the Landsgemeinde. This resolution was passed {{against the backdrop of the}} Protestant Reformation and the tensions following the First War of Kappel two years earlier. Soon thereafter, the Catholic cantons refused to help the Three Leagues (Drei Bünde) in Graubünden in the Musso war against the Duchy of Milan, Zürich promptly considered this a breach of contracts between the confederacy and the Three Leagues and declared an embargo against the five alpine Catholic cantons, in which Bern also participated. While the Tagsatzung had successfully mediated in 1529, on this occasion the attempt failed, not least because the reformation leader Huldrych Zwingli was <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> military confrontation. The Catholic cantons declared war on Zürich on 9 October 1531. On 11 October 1531, Schwyz, Uri and Zug decisively defeated the army of Zwingli. Hundreds of soldiers were killed, including Zwingli himself. Schwyz remained staunchly Catholic following the war.|$|E
500|$|Like court entertainment, royal {{occasions}} such as coronations and weddings provided {{opportunities to}} entertain both the aristocracy and the people. For example, the splendid 1595 Accession Day celebrations of Queen Elizabeth I offered tournaments and jousting {{and other events}} performed [...] "not only before the assembled court, in all their finery, but also before thousands of Londoners <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good day's entertainment. Entry for the day's events at the Tiltyard in Whitehall was set at 12d".|$|E
60|$|Stiffness {{was over}} {{when she came}} in, and Dr. May, who {{presently}} made his appearance, soon was much more at his ease than could have been hoped, after his previous declarations that he should {{never be able to}} be moderately civil about it to Mr. Rivers. People of ready sympathy, such as Dr. May and Margaret, {{have a great deal of}} difficulty with their sincerity spared them, by being carried along with the feelings of others. Ethel could not feel the same, and was bent on avoiding any expression of opinion; she hoped that Meta's ecstasies would all be bestowed upon her future sister-in-law; but Meta was <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> interview with Ethel herself, and, as usual, gained her point.|$|R
5000|$|Hantelmann posted {{his first}} victory claim on 29 May 1918, {{but it went}} unconfirmed. Thus, on June 6, when Jasta 15 dove into battle, he was <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> success. <b>As</b> his squadron-mate Joachim von Ziegsar recalled, [...] "Like a steer unbound, the {{aircraft}} with the Braunschweig Hussar's crest dived onto the enemy first." [...] A British Airco DH.4 fell before the young Prussian's guns.|$|R
50|$|In 1859, {{three years}} before the {{approval}} of the plan by the Russian government, Russian officials began talks with the Ottomans about the migration of a limited number of emigrants, and in 1860 they two sides negotiated <b>a</b> treaty <b>for</b> the migration of 40,000-50,000 Circassians, with the Ottoman side being <b>eager</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> increase in population. At this time, however, numerous Circassians around the Kuban and even Kalmyks had already been expelled to Ottoman lands as the Russians had swept them up in their systematic deportation of Nogais, with British newspapers reporting that Russian forces were forcing a choice of either the Ottoman Empire or Siberia on resident Nogai and Circassian populations, with 18000-20000 Circassians and Nogais ended up packed densely together outside the cities of Istanbul and Üsküdar.|$|R
