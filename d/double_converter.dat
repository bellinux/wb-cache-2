The converter {{consists of the}} five-level NPC rectifier, DC link, and the five-level NPC inverter. In this control strategy, the DC link voltages are controlled by using a closed loop with an optimized stabilization system called clamping bridge. It provides a fast and flexible control of the converter capacitor voltage. This method will redress the imbalance of DC link voltage. This control strategy is completely independent from the load control, leading to a simpler implementation. The three-phase five-level NPC rectifier-inverter system is an ideal interface between a utility and renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic or wind generator...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{method for}} {{programming}} current in dc/dc converters operating in discontinuous conduction mode {{is described in}} this paper. The control variable {{is the product of}} the square of the duty cyle and the switching period, i. e., P, which is directly proportional to input and output currents of a discontinuous-mode converter. A method of controlling P is applied to converters that utilize one switch (or one set of synchronous switches) for achieving two control functions. In particular a single-switch two-output boost converter, in which a continuous-mode converter and a discontinuous-mode converter share one active switch, is studied. In this system, current-mode control is used to regulate the output voltage of the continuous-mode converter and the proposed P control is used to regulate the other discontinuous-mode converter.

40|$|The {{telecommunications}} {{market is}} one of the large rapidly growing fields in today’s power supply industry due to the increasing demand for telecom distributed power supply (DPS) systems. The half-bridge LLC (Inductor-Inductor-Capacitor) resonant converter is currently the most attractive topology for the design and implementation of 24 V/ 48 V DC telecom power <b>converters.</b> The current <b>doubler</b> rectifier (CDR) <b>converter</b> topology was invented and described in the early 1950 s which can offer the unique characteristic of halving the output voltage while doubling the output current compared to a standard rectifier. In this thesis, the current <b>doubler</b> <b>converter</b> topology with its unique characteristic is evaluated as a complementary solution to improve the LLC resonant converter performance, especially for the low output voltage and high output current telecommunication applications. A novel half-bridge LLC resonant current <b>doubler</b> <b>converter</b> (LLC-CDR) is proposed in this thesis which can offer several performance benefits compared to conventional LLC-standard rectifier design. The unique characteristics of the LLC-CDR topology can offer significant improvements by transformation of a 48 V converter into a 24 V converter with the same power density. This thesis introduces a new SPICE-based simulation model to analyse the operation of this novel LLC-CDR converter circuit design. This model can be used to define the critical component parameters for the LLC -CDR circuit output inductor values. It {{can also be used to}} predict the circuit overall performance under different load conditions. Both time-domain based transient simulation analysis and frequency-domain based AC analysis provided by this simulation model showed favourable results in comparison to bench measurement results on a prototype. The model provides a valuable insight to reveal some of the unique characteristics of this LLC -CDR topology. It demonstrates a proof of concept that the conventional LLC resonant converter can be easily redesigned for low voltage, high current applications by using the LLC-CDR topology without requiring a new design for the LLC resonant stage components and the power transformer. A new magnetic integration solution was proposed to significantly improve the overall performance in the LLC-CDR topology that had not been published before. The LLC-CDR converter hardware prototypes with two output inductors coupled and uncoupled configurations were extensively modelled, constructed and bench tested. Test results demonstrated the suitability of an integrated coupled inductors design for the novel LLC-CDR converter application. The integrated coupled inductors design can significantly improve the LLC-CDR converter frequency-domain based AC simulation analysis results. In addition, these results also illustrate the potential benefit of how the magnetic integration design in general could reduce the magnetic component size, cost, and weight compared to the uncoupled inductors design. Finally, a hardware prototype circuit was constructed based on a commercial 1800 W single phase telecom power converter to verify the operation of this novel half bridge LLC-CDR topology. The converter prototype successfully operated at both no load and full load conditions with the nominal output voltage halved from 48 VDC to 24 VDC, and doubled the output current to match the same output power density. It also demonstrates that the efficiency of this novel half bridge LLC –CDR is 92 % compares to 90 % of EATON’s commercial 24 VDC LLC resonant converter, which can fulfill the research goals...|$|R

Later on, additional double lenses with focal lengths of 55 mm and 250 mm were introduced; one even had a dimmable viewfinder lens, which enabled depth of field adjustment through the viewfinder. By comparison, the Rolleiflex only had a single, fixed normal lens, although the Rollei Magnar tele-converter lens with 4x magnification was available as an accessory.

The work detailed in the thesis compares the performance of single-phase thyristor bridge converters under different control strategies; considering in particular the efficiency, ac side power factor and harmonic content of the current and voltage waveforms. Extensive practical investigations were performed, in which, analogue and digital control circuits were developed to provide the drive signals necessary for a converter {{to operate in the}} different control modes for: a) A series -connected fully-controlled double thyristor bridge (used mainly in traction applications) operating under sequence control and; b) A fully controlled single-bridge operating under sequence and conventional control. A novel pulse-width modulation control strategy was developed for the single-bridge converter, using gate turn-off thyristors as the switching elements, whereby output voltage control is obtained by variation of the modulation index. Turn-on and turn-off signals for the power devices were obtained using an analogue control circuit. The advantages and disadvantages of this switching strategy compared with conventional and sequence control were studied, and results clearly showed that an improved input power factor and lower supply current and load voltage harmonics were all obtained. Mathematical models for single and <b>double</b> bridge <b>converters</b> operating under sequence and conventional control were developed using tensor techniques.

A Switch Is Closed Only When A Near-Zero Voltage Exists Across The Switch. In Order To Bring About This Result, A Diode And Capacitor Are Connected In Parallel With Each Switch And An Inductor Is Placed In Output Line. When One Switch Opens, The Other Switch Closes Only When There Is Less Than 0. 7 Volts Across The Switch. The Time Period During Which The Voltage Across The Switch To Be Closed Is Less Than 0. 7 Volts Is A Function Of The Resonant Frequency Of The Capacitance Associated With The Switch To Be Closed And The Inductance Associated With The Output Lines And The Load To Which The Output Lines Are Connected. One Or More Capacitors Are Placed In One Of The Output Lines To Block Dc. The Resonant Frequency Of The Output-Line Capacitors And Inductor Is At Least A Factor Of Two Less Than The Switching Frequency. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
