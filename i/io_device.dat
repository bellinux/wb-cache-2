5000|$|Connection {{establishment}} {{starts with}} the IO Controller sending a connect request to the <b>IO</b> <b>Device.</b> The connect request establishes an Application Relationship (AR) containing a number of Communication Relationships (CRs) between the IO Controller and <b>IO</b> <b>Device.</b> [...] The connect request defines some CRs within the AR. The following CRs are supported: ...|$|E
50|$|Acknowledgement of the {{connect request}} by the <b>IO</b> <b>Device</b> allows {{parameterization}} to follow. From this point forward, both the <b>IO</b> <b>Device</b> and IO Controller start exchanging cyclic process I/O data frames. The process I/O data frames don't contain valid data at this point, but they start serving as keep-alive {{to keep the}} watchdog from expiring.|$|E
5000|$|The IO Supervisor is {{software}} typically {{based on}} a PC for setting parameters and diagnosing individual <b>IO</b> <b>Devices.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Sony Memory Stick slot is {{underneath}} the CompactFlash slot. It will accept only Memory Stick memory storage cards; Wi-Fi and Bluetooth cards {{will not work}} as there are no Windows XP drivers for any such Memory Stick <b>IO</b> <b>devices</b> at this time.|$|R
50|$|The IO Controller writes {{parameterization}} data to each <b>IO</b> <b>Device</b> sub-module {{in accordance}} with the General Station Description Mark-up Language (GSDML) file. Once all sub-modules have been configured, the IO Controller signals that parameterization has ended. The <b>IO</b> <b>Device</b> responds by signalling application readiness, which allows process IO data exchange and alarm handling to ensue.|$|E
50|$|The <b>IO</b> <b>Device</b> {{followed}} by the IO Controller start to cyclically refresh valid process I/O data. The IO Controller processes the inputs and controls the outputs of the IO Device.Alarm notifications are exchanged acyclically between the IO Controller and <b>IO</b> <b>Device</b> as events and faults occur during this phase in the PROFINET IO connection life-cycle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{connection}} between the <b>IO</b> <b>Device</b> and IO Controller terminates when the watchdog expires. [...] Watchdog expiry {{is the result of}} a failure to refresh cyclic process I/O data by the IO Controller or the <b>IO</b> <b>Device.</b> [...] Unless the connection was intentionally terminated at the IO Controller, the IO Controller will try to restart the PROFINET IO connection life-cycle.|$|E
50|$|An individual's exocortex {{would be}} {{composed}} of external memory modules, processors, <b>IO</b> <b>devices</b> and software systems that would interact with, and augment, a person's biological brain. Typically this interaction is described as being conducted through a direct brain-computer interface, making these extensions functionally part of the individual's mind.|$|R
30|$|On {{the path}} of making FPGA design more {{amenable}} to software developers, FPGA vendors have adopted software frameworks such as OpenCL [11, 36] for accelerator development. These frameworks, as {{a side effect of}} having raised the abstraction level in the hardware design process, have also made it easier to integrate certain <b>IO</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
30|$|A {{drawback}} of the FROST {{framework is}} that it overwrites the heap of the previously running kernel, because the framework boots a full-fledged Linux kernel. This includes information like structures of the MMU, the list of running processes and the memory mappings of processes to physical locations. Additionally, the kernel likely reinitializes Input/Output (<b>IO)</b> <b>devices,</b> which resets the corresponding device memory.|$|R

40|$|The {{advances}} in optoelectronics {{over the last}} three decades have been quite dramatic, namely the mass manufacturing of low cost integrated circuits, revolutionizing the speed and the capability of computing and communication. However, today's ever-increasing demand for high-bandwidth data is outgrowing the performance of electronics in many applications, such as in telecommunications where the traffic demand has been increasing steadily and, therefore, the transmission technology requires bandwidth that exceeds the one provided by actual copper based networks. In this context, the fabrication of low-cost integrated optics (<b>IO)</b> <b>devices</b> using sol-gel derived organic-inorganic hybrid (OIH) materials has received increasing attention in the last years. This review will focus on examples of OIHs {{that can be used in}} <b>IO</b> <b>devices</b> for the next generation of optical networks. Emphasis will be given to passive (planar and channel waveguides, couplers and multimode interference splitters) and active (lasers and optical amplifiers) optical architectures for long haul/metro and access/indoor networks.

30|$|Bone marrow {{puncture}} needle insertion for IO vascular access {{is a standard}} procedure used, especially in paediatric resuscitation (Fiorito et al. 2005), and <b>IO</b> <b>devices</b> has expanded its role to include resuscitation in patients of all ages (Glaeser 1993). However, it is sometimes difficult to perform IO rapidly and precisely with conventional manual bone marrow {{puncture needle}}. Furthermore, managing resuscitation can be challenging if the essential drugs or infusion cannot be administered (Vidal et al. 1993).|$|R
30|$|We on {{the other}} hand have {{demonstrated}} an embedded system solution for data transfer, and more importantly, have shown that for a class of applications that have physical <b>IO</b> <b>devices</b> as their system level bottleneck, the system level performance is not degraded. For other classes of applications that have no such IO bottlenecks to begin with, our embedded solution does degrade system performance, however, we have also shown that in such cases scaling the acceleration is enough to counterbalance the IO performance loss caused by our solution.|$|R
50|$|The PROFINET IO {{connection}} life-cycle {{describes the}} connection between a PROFINET IO Controller and <b>IO</b> <b>Device.</b> The connection allows the cyclic exchange of process IO data, and the acyclic handling of alarms. The PROFINET IO connection life-cycle consists of address resolution, connection establishment, parameterization, process IO data exchange / alarm handling, and termination.|$|E
50|$|The {{characteristics}} of an <b>IO</b> <b>Device</b> are {{described by the}} device manufacturer in a General Station Description (GSD) file. The language {{used for this purpose}} is the GSDML (GSD Markup Language) - an XML based language. The GSD file provides the supervision software with a basis for planning the configuration of a PROFINET IO system.|$|E
50|$|A PROFINET <b>IO</b> <b>device</b> is {{identified}} on the PROFINET network by its station name. Connection establishment, parameterization and alarm handling are implemented with User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which {{requires that the}} device also be assigned an IP address.

5000|$|As {{a result}} of the limited 32 MB ROM memory, the last two need a memory card to install, merging the phone memory with the memory card and thus making the {{external}} VGA camera unusable when using these updates, since the camera connects via the SD slot. Because of how the camera connects, there is much debate if the slot supports SDIO. It is generally believed that it has some kind of hardware support for <b>IO</b> <b>devices</b> but the lack of drivers for the MPx200 does not permit the use of this function for other possible addons.|$|R
40|$|Owing to {{the small}} size of {{integrated}} optical (<b>IO)</b> <b>devices</b> many basic functions can be integrated on one single IO chip. IO sensors are suitable candidates for accurate detection of small changes of physical or chemical parameters. The integration offers advantages such as enabling a high density of functionalities, automatic and stable alignment of elements, a high potential for mass production with in principle low production costs, and the possibility for the realization of sensor arrays for multi-parameter detection. The main goal of this PhD project is firstly to design, fabricate and demonstrate functioning <b>IO</b> <b>devices</b> based on grated waveguides for sensing applications. A grated waveguide (GWG) is a waveguide with a finite-length grated section, being a structure with a periodic variation of the dielectric constant. Such a structure acts as both a 1 -dimensional photonic crystal and, owing to modal reflections at the waveguide-GWG transitions, an optical resonator, as evidenced by fringes in the transmission spectrum. In particular near the band edge these fringes can be extremely sharp, which is related to both the near band edge shape of the dispersion curve, corresponding to slow light propagation, and high modal reflectance due to mode mismatch between waveguide and GWG modes. Both effects lead to strong light-matter interaction, which can be exploited for sensing applications. In this thesis, we demonstrate the versatility of a silicon nitride GWG optical cavity as a compact IO sensor for bulk-index concentration sensing, label-free protein sensing and mechano-optical gas sensing...|$|R

50|$|The needle is {{injected}} through the bone's hard cortex {{and into the}} soft marrow interior which allows immediate access to the vascular system. An IO infusion {{can be used on}} adult or pediatric patients when traditional methods of vascular access are difficult or otherwise cause unwanted delayed management of the administration of medications. Each <b>IO</b> <b>device</b> has different designed locations, but the most common site of insertion is the antero-medial aspect of the upper, proximal tibia as it lies just under the skin and can easily be palpated and located. The anterior aspect of the femur, the superior iliac crest {{and the head of the}} humerus are other sites that can be used. The IO needle is then positioned at a 90 degree angle to the injection site, and the needle is advanced through manual traction, impact driven force, or power driven. The site of injection can be maintained for 24-72 hours, after which another route of access should be obtained to prevent the risk of an infection at the site.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{virtualization}} has gained widespread importance. Virtual Machines (VMs) can now share network access in hardware, or in software or in a hybridized way. Input/Output (IO) virtualization technologies based on software utilize emulation technique, but this requires Virtualization Manager which presents central processing overhead {{in a significant}} amount. Besides, each IO operation in turn poses overhead additionally and any supported advanced capabilities inherent of physical hardware are not utilized properly. Some direct assignment based IO virtualization technologies suffer from limitations to scalability. The support for Quality of Service (QoS) may be offered within the software layers at the Virtualization Manager or Guest Operating System level which interact with the <b>IO</b> <b>device</b> that is being shared. With a preliminary investigation of the functionality of the RiceNIC (an open standard platform meant for research and education into concurrent network interface design), {{a study of the}} various network interface technologies supporting <b>IO</b> <b>device</b> virtualization was carried out to precisely understand IO virtualized network interfaces. The project describes a resource allocation policy for the on-device memory of the <b>IO</b> <b>device</b> being shared, taking the instance of a complex <b>IO</b> <b>device,</b> i. e., a Network Interface Controller(NIC) supporting a reconfigurable virtualized network interface architecture design which endures multiple reconfigurable virtualized network interfaces working independently using a reconfigurable partitioned memory.

40|$|With the {{advances}} in non-volatile memory technologies, the access latencies and bandwidth of storage class memories such as PCM, spin-transfer torque RAMs, have improved three {{orders of magnitude}} compared to hard disks. Along with these improvements, internal bandwidth of the solid state drives (SSDs) has increased and has exceeded the bandwidth on the Host Interface. Thus the Host Interface is the performance bottleneck when the SSDs are treated as simple block <b>IO</b> <b>devices.</b> With the decrease in access latency of the new memory technologies, the memory latency is {{a small fraction of}} the total access latency from the host. These observations indicate that treating SSDs made of fast memories as just block <b>IO</b> <b>devices</b> will restrict the system performance gains. In this work, we propose an Software-Defined SSD (SDSSD) Architecture that expands the scope of an SSD to a smart device with compute logic. By moving computations inside the SSD, the amount of data transferred to the host is reduced, thereby reducing the impact of the host interface bottleneck. The compute logic is made software programmable enabling different host applications to make use of it. The compute logic and the host applications interact using a generic RPC Interface, thus making programming simple. The proposed architecture is designed and implemented on a FPGA prototyping board. The results from the IO benchmarks run on the SDSSD prototype indicate that, bandwidth and latency of SDSSD Architecture matches closely to the performance of the SSD Architecture with IO specific logic for large access size...|$|R

40|$|Background & objectives: Intraosseous (IO) {{access is}} an {{alternative}} to difficult intravenous (iv) access during emergency clinical situations. Existing IO solutions are expensive, require power supply and trained manpower; limiting their use in resource constrained settings. To address these limitations, a novel <b>IO</b> <b>device</b> has been developed. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate functionality and safety of this device in adult human cadavers. Methods: The ability of the <b>IO</b> <b>device</b> to penetrate the proximal and/or distal tibia was evaluated in three adult cadavers. Subjective parameters of loss of resistance, stable needle hold, easy needle withdrawal and any damage to the device were evaluated during the study. The insertion time was the objective parameter measured. Four sets of radiographs per insertion confirmed the position of the needle and identified complications. Results: A single physician performed 12 IO access procedures using the same device. Penetration of proximal and/or distal tibia was achieved in all instances. It was successful in the first attempt in eight (66. 7 %) and during second attempt in the remaining. The mean time to insertion was 4. 1 ± 3. 1 sec. Appropriate insertion of needle in the intra-medullary space of bone was confirmed with radiological examination in 10 (83. 3 %) insertions. In two occasions after penetrating the cortical layer of bone, the device overshot the intra-medullary space, as detected by radiological examination. Device got bent during insertion in one instance. There was no evidence of needle breakage or bone fracture. The needle could be withdrawn effortlessly in all instances. Interpretation & conclusions: The novel <b>IO</b> <b>device</b> could successfully penetrate the adult cadaver bones in most cases. Further studies are needed to confirm these results on a large sample...|$|E
30|$|From the Profinet <b>IO</b> <b>device</b> model, {{illustrated}} in Figure 1, {{it can be}} seen that a subslot (instance of a submodule) allows for example both IO Data and Record Data, where the former is used to transport process values from and to the devices, and the latter to transport device configuration data. It is also possible for subslots to transfer diagnostic data, such as process or device alarms. Hence, the concept of subslots (submodules) is central in modeling Profinet IO devices. The concept of a slot (instance of a module), will be treated as a container grouping subslots into physical or logical units.|$|E

40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{performed}} to assess the function and longevity of a novel intraosseous (<b>IO)</b> catheter <b>device.</b> For the initial study, nine animals were assigned to three study groups. The first group received a 25 mm intraosseous device within the proximal humerus, the second group within the proximal tibia, and standard jugular catheters {{were placed in the}} final control group. Serial aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures were collected from jugular veins at day zero, then every third day while devices remained in use. Radiographs were obtained immediately after placement and again after removal of all <b>IO</b> <b>devices.</b> Goats were observed for overall clinical condition and lameness associated with catheter sites, and catheters were evaluated for patency and proper positioning. <b>IO</b> <b>devices</b> in the tibia remained in for less time than those in the humerus. Blood cultures in this study showed growth of Bacillus, Staphylococcus, and one colony within the genera Brachyacterium or novel Dermabacteraceae. Catheters also showed growth of Bacillus, as well as a single colony of Micromonospora chalcea. No animals in either IO group exhibited radiographic evidence of resulting damage or structural change within surrounding bone. In study two, eighteen goats were assigned to two study groups (25 mm intraosseous device within the wing of the ilium, or 45 mm catheter in the proximal humerus). Blood for serial aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures and CBC were collected from jugular veins at day zero, then every second day thereafter while devices remained in use. All clinical monitoring and removal criteria were identical to study one. Catheters in the ilium remained in significantly less time than those in the humerus. Several animals in the proximal humerus group demonstrated moderate lameness following removal. One goat developed an abscess near the insertion site and showed radiographic evidence of periosteal bone growth. Serial cultures showed growth of Bacillus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus. Bloodwork indicated mild elevations of white blood cells from baseline in some cases. Our study indicated that catheters may remain safely in place for greater than 24 hours, but that animals should be closely monitored for negative side-effects for several days during the post-removal period...|$|R

Low-power OS observes the relationship between hardware devices and processes. The OS kernel estimates the utilization of a device from each process. If a device is not used by any running process, the OS puts it into a low-power state. This paper also explains how scheduling can facilitate power management. When processes are properly scheduled, power reduction can be achieved without degrading performance.
