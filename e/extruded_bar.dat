Oxidation of primary carbides is suggested as one cause of fatigue crack initiation at elevated temperatures, though little has been published about the precise mechanism by which this occurs. This paper {{presents the results of}} preliminary studies on high temperature fatigue crack initiation in Inconel 718, a material used extensively for components in gas turbines. Comparisons are made between material taken from an <b>extruded</b> <b>bar</b> and a turbine disc forging. Fatigue tests were performed in air at 600 oC on U-notch specimens, designed to simulate the stress concentration factor of a blade root fixing. Fatigue lives using 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 and 1 - 30 - 1 - 1 trapezoidal waveforms are compared. Differences in lifetimes between the <b>extruded</b> <b>bar</b> and disc material are discussed with reference to their different microstructures. Post-fracture analysis using optical and scanning electron microscopy indicates that swelling and eruption of oxidising (Nb,Ti) C carbides is a significant cause of fatigue crack initiation. To further investigate the role of erupted carbides in crack initiation, some tests were performed at room temperature, using a 10 Hz sinusoidal waveform. Characterisation of surface crack initiation behaviour in plain, polished bend bars is presented, comparing the as-polished condition with specimens thermally exposed for 4 hours at 600 oC to induce carbide oxidation.
