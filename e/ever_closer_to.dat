Today music, as it becomes continually more complicated, strives to amalgamate the most dissonant, strange and harsh sounds. In this way we come <b>ever</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> noise-sound.|$|E

5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1942, Lindwall helped the St. George Dragons rugby league team to reach the grand final for the second {{consecutive}} year and also finished the season as the League's top point-scorer. Lindwall and his brother Jack, who played on the wing, scored all of the team's points in the grand final, Jack scoring a try and Ray kicking three goals. However they were denied by a last-minute penalty goal and St. George were defeated by Canterbury-Bankstown 11–9. All the while, the Japanese were inching <b>ever</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Australia. Malaya had fallen and the northern Australian city of Darwin had been the subject of Japanese air raids.|$|E

5|$|Francis, {{having heard}} Elizabeth's screams, enters the dungeon. Nicholas confuses Francis for Bartolome, and knocks him unconscious. He straps {{him to a}} stone slab located {{directly}} beneath a huge razor-sharp pendulum. The pendulum {{is attached to a}} clockwork apparatus that causes it to descend fractions of an inch after each swing, <b>ever</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Francis's torso. Catherine arrives just in time with Maximillian, one of the servants. After a brief struggle with Maximillian, Nicholas falls to his death in the pit. Francis is removed from the torture device. As they leave the basement, Catherine vows to seal up the chamber forever. They slam and lock the door shut, unaware that Elizabeth is still alive, gagged and trapped in the iron maiden.|$|E
5|$|Following Andriamihaja's death, the {{influence}} of Radama's old guard of progressives was eclipsed by that of conservative advisers at court, who grew <b>ever</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the queen, eventually resulting in Ranavalona's marriage to sampy guardian and conservative figurehead Field Marshal Rainiharo (also called Ravoninahitriniarivo) of Ilafy in 1833. Rainiharo gained initial access to the court through his father, Andriantsilavonandriana, a hova (commoner) who had exceptionally been accorded the privilege of joining King Andrianampoinimerina's inner circle of noble advisers. Field Marshal Rainiharo served as the queen's First Minister from 1830 to 1832, then Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief from 1832 to 1852. Upon Rainiharo's death, the queen wed another conservative, Field Marshal Andrianisa (also called Rainijohary), who remained Ranavalona's husband until her death in 1861. He served as Prime Minister from 1852 to 1862 before being exiled to the royal city of Ambohimanga {{for his part in}} a plot against the queen's son, Radama II.|$|E
5|$|William Rufus {{crossed into}} Normandy {{to take the}} war to Robert in 1094, and when {{progress}} stalled, called upon Henry for assistance. Henry responded, but travelled to London instead of joining the main campaign further east in Normandy, possibly {{at the request of}} the King, who in any event abandoned the campaign and returned to England. Over the next few years, Henry appears to have strengthened his power base in western Normandy, visiting England occasionally to attend at William Rufus's court. In 1095 Pope Urban II called the First Crusade, encouraging knights from across Europe to join. Robert joined the Crusade, borrowing money from William Rufus to do so, and granting the King temporary custody of his part of the Duchy in exchange. The King appeared confident of regaining the remainder of Normandy from Robert, and Henry appeared <b>ever</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> William Rufus, the pair campaigning together in the Norman Vexin between 1097 and 1098.|$|E

25|$|Implementation {{of color}} {{photography}} was hindered by the limited sensitivity of early photographic materials, which were mostly sensitive to blue, only slightly sensitive to green, and virtually insensitive to red. The discovery of dye sensitization by photochemist Hermann Vogel in 1873 suddenly {{made it possible}} to add sensitivity to green, yellow and even red. Improved color sensitizers and ongoing improvements in the overall sensitivity of emulsions steadily reduced the once-prohibitive long exposure times required for color, bringing it <b>ever</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> commercial viability.|$|E
25|$|The {{distance}} between the defender line and the midfielder line should be kept constant at about 15 metres. However, the defensive line should back up and thus increase this distance, stand off, {{when there is no}} pressure on the opponent in possession, as this increases the possibility of a through ball. With tough pressure on the opponent, the distance may be reduced to below 15 metres. Also, as opponents move in close to the penalty area, the defending team will be forced to move their midfielders <b>ever</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> their defenders.|$|E
25|$|In early October 1943, Hitler {{was persuaded}} by his Army Group Commander in Southern Italy, Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, that the defence of Italy should be {{conducted}} {{as far away from}} Germany as possible. This would {{make the most of the}} natural defensive geography of Central Italy, whilst denying the Allies the easy capture of a succession of airfields; each one being <b>ever</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Germany. Hitler was also convinced that yielding southern Italy would provide the Allies with a springboard for an invasion of the Balkans with its vital resources of oil, bauxite and copper.|$|E

25|$|The final Sunday, {{featuring}} the men's singles final, saw Rafael Nadal win the first Wimbledon {{title of his}} career and fifth Grand Slam tournament.

Nadal, the No. 2 seed and four-time French Open champion was Federer's challenger {{for the third consecutive}} year, and was aiming to become the first man since Björn Borg to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year. Nadal's countryman, Manuel Santana, the last Spaniard to have won the Wimbledon title (in 1966), said Nadal could take inspiration from Spain's victory in the recent European Championships, which Spain had last won in 1964.|$|E
25|$|After five {{losses and}} then a win to end May, June saw Derbyshire stretch their unbeaten streak to two as Derbyshire drew against Essex. Derbyshire {{had the chance to}} get their first Championship win of the season, as they earned a 142-run first innings lead, but left their opponents with two {{sessions}} to chase 379, and Essex survived for the draw. Two one-day wins followed, over Kent and the touring Bangladeshis, but on 13 June they posted 82 all out against Durham to lose by five wickets. Derbyshire came <b>ever</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the elusive Championship win, however, as Lancashire eked through by one wicket in the last match {{before the end of the}} spring season.

25|$|On {{the night}} of the 14 July the French opened the {{trenches}} using 2,400 workers supported by 10 companies of grenadiers and 5 battalions of infantry. Lowendal used 12,000 of his troops to man the trench lines and deployed the other 18,000 as an army of observation. The first parallel was laid overnight of the first day, 400 paces out from the fortifications. On 17 July the second parallel was dug and over {{the night of}} 22 July the third parallel was completed. Batteries were raised and the French artillery began to bombard the defenders on the 20 July. Each of the trench parallels were laid and their saps pushed forward by the French, drawing <b>ever</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the fortress.

500|$|The {{approximation}} {{problem in}} network synthesis {{is to find}} functions which will produce realisable networks approximating to a prescribed function of frequency within limits arbitrarily set. The approximation problem {{is an important issue}} since the ideal function of frequency required will commonly be unachievable with rational networks. For instance, the ideal prescribed function is often taken to be the unachievable lossless transmission in the passband, infinite attenuation in the stopband and a vertical transition between the two. [...] However, the ideal function can be approximated with a rational function, becoming <b>ever</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the ideal the higher the order of the polynomial. [...] The first to address this problem was Stephen Butterworth (1930) using his Butterworth polynomials. Independently, Cauer (1931) used Chebyshev polynomials, initially applied to image filters, and not to the now well-known ladder realisation of this filter.|$|E

This was the first time a world record had been set using the V-style, with Piotr Fijas' being the last to use the parallel style. Andreas Goldberger got tantalisingly close to the magic number when he landed at [...] but failed to maintain his balance as he squatted down and touched the snow with his hands, rendering his jump an unofficial world record.

In the review he stated that [...] "Riot Act isn't one thing or the other: tracks such as [...] "Ghost" [...] or [...] "Get Right" [...] gesture towards hard rock without really putting the hammer down, while a more reflective piece like [...] "All or None" [...] doesn't exploit its own possibilities." [...] Sweeting observed, [...] "On full, Pearl Jam sound like Stillwater, Cameron Crowe's fictional 1970s second-raters from his film Almost Famous."

500|$|By lap 45, Vettel and Rosberg {{encountered}} backmarkers on track, {{which allowed}} Rosberg to {{move closer to}} his compatriot, trailing him by less than three seconds. On lap 49, Mercedes told Hamilton to increase his speed, without giving the driver an explanation. With Hamilton leading Vettel by 23 seconds, the call came unexpected. It later proved {{to be caused by}} the fact that Hamilton's left rear tyre had too little pressure at the start, leading the team to fear for a time penalty after the race. Fernando Alonso retired from the race on lap 50 due to loss of power. One lap later, Räikkönen moved into sixth place by overtaking the Force India of Sergio Pérez. With one lap to go, Rosberg was moving <b>ever</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Vettel in front, when his engine failed, forcing him to retire, handing Felipe Massa the final spot on the podium, who defended the position from teammate Bottas over the final lap. Lewis Hamilton finished the race to take victory on what he himself described as [...] "the best [...] I've ever driven". He finished more than 25 seconds ahead of Vettel.|$|E
500|$|Ian Winwood {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five [...] "Ks" [...] for the British {{magazine}} Kerrang!, an [...] "excellent" [...] review. He called the music far more upbeat than Enter Shikari's serious message: [...] "This 11-song set is a good deal of fun to listen to, even if its lyrics' subject matters are the exact opposite." [...] Winwood also reviewed the album favourably for BBC Music, comparing its lyrics to The King Blues' Punk & Poetry and calling Enter Shikari [...] "the only other mainstream-breaching British rock band concerning itself with the news of the world". Johnny Firecloud gave the album an eight-out-of-ten rating on CraveOnline: [...] "Enter Shikari have found a balance while honing a voice of rebellion – at a time where tearing down boundaries and microanalyzing the current structure is more vital and valuable than ever before in our lives." [...] Iain Moffat of The Fly said of the album that 'Disenchantment should always be this spellbinding.' In NME, Dan Martin gave the album an eight-out-of-ten rating: [...] "All of that surface tension lands Enter Shikari in a pretty powerful position for their third – and, as the title promises fabulously, they respond to the challenge in explosive style to deliver something like their defining statement." [...] Rocksound writer Ryan Bird gave the album a nine-out-of-ten score, praising the band for their emotional cultural and sonic development and noting the importance of their message: [...] "In a world edging <b>ever</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> complete and utter destruction, Enter Shikari remain fearless and uncompromising leaders in a field of one." ...|$|E
