25|$|The {{issue price}} at which investors buy the bonds {{when they are}} first issued will {{typically}} be approximately equal to the nominal amount. The net proceeds that the issuer receives are thus the issue price, less issuance fees. The market price of the bond will vary over its life: it may trade at a premium (above par, usually because market interest rates have fallen since issue), or at a <b>discount</b> (<b>price</b> below par, if market rates have risen or {{there is a high}} probability of default on the bond).|$|E

25|$|In October 2011, Samsung ambushed the Australian {{launch of}} Apple's iPhone 4S {{smartphone}} {{by setting up}} a pop-up store near Sydney's Apple Store. At the store, the company sold its competing Galaxy S II to the first 10 people in line daily at a <b>discount</b> <b>price</b> of $2 AUD. Samsung similarly piggybacked the launch of its successor, the iPhone 5, to promote the Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II; the company purchased keyword advertisements for the devices on major search engines, as well as Twitter and YouTube, thus causing ads for them to appear on searches relating to iPhone 5.|$|E
25|$|When a {{real-world}} airline is {{created in the}} image of a virtual airline, legal issues can arise out of copyright violations. In 2003, a real world airline, Qantas Airways Ltd, announced a new low-cost carrier by the name of Jetstar Airways. However, a virtual airline named Jetstar International Airlines already existed, complete with a web site. As part of their startup promotion, Qantas sold 100,000 airline tickets at a <b>discount</b> <b>price,</b> and the virtual airline's web site was swamped with would-be customers, job-seekers, and prospective vendors. The virtual airline sued Qantas, claiming that Qantas stole the virtual airline's livery and trademark. The matter was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.|$|E

500|$|Hubner and Kistner {{commented that}} {{the large number of}} {{produced}} cartridges may have resulted in excess inventory regardless of E.T.s success. Even though the game was a best seller during the holiday season, retailers still stated that its sales figures did not meet expectations. Warner Communications also expressed disappointment at the number of sales. Lower-than-expected sales figures combined with excess inventory, which produced a negative supply and demand event, prompted retailers to repeatedly <b>discount</b> <b>price.</b> According to Ray Kassar, about 3.5 million of the 4 million produced were sent back to the company as unsold inventory or customer returns. Despite sales figures, the quantity of unsold merchandise, coupled with the expensive movie license and the large number of returns, made E.T. a major financial failure for Atari. [...] By 2004, the cartridges were still very common and offered at very low prices.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2012, Terry Anderson {{established}} {{a company called}} Autonomous Tractor Corporation (ATC) located in North Dakota. The SPIRIT driverless tractor {{is a product of}} ATC. Anderson thought tractors were getting bigger and more expensive while not improving in quality. He thus came out of retirement to create the SPIRIT. The tractors Anderson helped create were initially made to follow a main tractor (that has a driver) but are now moving towards independent functioning. [...] Anderson tested half-scale models of his automated tractor design at his second home in Texas. He presented his model at the Big Iron Farm Show in September 2012. Anderson stated that his goal is to build 25 units of his automated tractor in 2013 and sell them at a <b>discount</b> <b>price</b> for farmers to test.|$|E
2500|$|During this time, European {{settlement}} accelerated, and in 1859 {{the number}} of Pākehā came to equal {{the number of}} Māori, at around 60,000 each. Settlers were keen to obtain land and some Māori were willing to sell, {{but there were also}} strong pressures to retain land - in particular from the Māori King Movement. Grey had to manage the demand for land for the settlers to farm and the commitments in the Treaty of Waitangi that the Māori chiefs retained full [...] "exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties." [...] The treaty also specifies that Māori will sell land only to the Crown. The potential for conflict between the Māori and settlers was exacerbated as the British authorities progressively eased restrictions on land sales after an agreement at the end of 1840 between the company and Colonial Secretary Lord John Russell, which provided for land purchases by the New Zealand Company from the Crown at a <b>discount</b> <b>price,</b> and a charter to buy and sell land under government supervision. Money raised by the government from sales to the company would be spent on assisting migration to New Zealand. The agreement was hailed by the company as [...] "all that we could desire ... our Company is really to be the agent of the state for colonizing NZ." [...] The Government waived its right of pre-emption in the Wellington region, Wanganui and New Plymouth in September 1841.|$|E
