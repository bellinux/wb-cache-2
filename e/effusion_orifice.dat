This device, {{defined by the}} field and source apertures, was proposed in order to eliminate any additional contribution to the genuine molecular beam of surface vaporizations coming from {{the vicinity of the}} <b>effusion</b> <b>orifice</b> as usually detected by the ion source of a mass spectrometer. METHODSThe molecular transmission of the " restricted collimation device" was calculated using a vaporization law under vacuum taking into account the real surface where the molecules are emitted, i. e., the sample evaporation surface in the Knudsen cell or the <b>effusion</b> <b>orifice</b> section, towards the ion source inlet by integration of elementary solid angles. RESULTSAn optimum is observed depending on the pair of selected apertures that define the restricted collimation device, i. e., the field and source apertures. This optimum is different from that previously calculated when taking into account only the solid angle, as defined by the restricted collimation device. CONCLUSIONSThis difference is attributed to the previously approximate assumption that optimizing the restricted collimation solid angle automatically optimizes the sampling of the effused beam included in the restricted collimation angle. Moreover, the location of the evaporating surface for molecules traveling through the collimation device towards the ionization chamber remains an important factor: the distance between the sample evaporation surface and the field aperture is of paramount importance as it changes the molecular...|$|E
40|$|The {{vaporization}} {{behavior of}} the A 1 -O system has been studied on numerous occasions but significant uncertainties remain. The origin of this uncertainty must be understood before A 1 -O vaporization behavior can be accurately determined. The condensation of A 12 O 3 and clogging of the <b>effusion</b> <b>orifice</b> is a difficult problem for the Knudsen effusion technique that influences the measured vaporization behavior but has only received limited attention. This study reconsiders this behavior in detail. A new theory for A 12 O 3 condensation is proposed together with procedures that will improve the measured thermodynamic properties of A 1 -O vaporization...|$|E
40|$|The evaporation/decomposition {{behavior}} of the imidazolium ionic liquid 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMImPF 6) was investigated in the overall temperature range 425 - 551 K {{by means of the}} molecular-effusion-based techniques Knudsen effusion mass loss (KEML) and Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry (KEMS), using <b>effusion</b> <b>orifices</b> of different size (from 0. 2 to 3 mm in diameter). Specific effusion fluxes measured by KEML were found to depend markedly on the orifice size, suggesting the occurrence of a kinetically delayed evaporation/decomposition process. KEMS experiments revealed that other species are present in the vapor phase besides the intact ion pair BMImPF 6 (g) produced by the simple evaporation BMImPF 6 (l) = BMImPF 6 (g), with relative abundances depending on the orifice size-the larger the orifice, the larger the contribution of the BMImPF 6 (g) species. By combining KEML and KEMS results, the conclusion is drawn that in the investigated temperature range, when small <b>effusion</b> <b>orifices</b> are used, {{a significant part of the}} mass loss/volatility of BMImPF 6 is due to molecular products formed by decomposition/dissociation processes rather than to evaporated intact ion pairs. Additional experiments performed by nonisothermal thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) further support the evidence of simultaneous evaporation/decomposition, although the conventional decomposition temperature derived from TG curves is much higher than the temperatures covered in effusion experiments. Partial pressures of the BMImPF 6 (g) species were derived from KEMS spectra and analyzed by second- and third-law methods giving a value of ΔevapH 298 K(°) = 145. 3 ± 2. 9 kJ·mol(- 1) for the standard evaporation enthalpy of BMImPF 6.

40|$|The {{vaporization}} behaviour and thermodynamics of the {{ionic liquid}} 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethyl) sulfonylimide (BMImNTf(2)) were studied {{by combining the}} Knudsen Effusion Mass Loss (KEML) and Knudsen Effusion Mass Spectrometry (KEMS) techniques. KEML {{studies were carried out}} in a large temperature range (398 - 567) K by using <b>effusion</b> <b>orifices</b> with 0. 3, 1, and 3 mm diameters. The vapor pressures so measured revealed no kinetically hindered vaporization effects and provided second-law vaporization enthalpies at the mean experimental temperatures in close agreement with literature. By exploiting the large temperature range covered, the heat capacity change associated with vaporization was estimated, resulting in a value of - 66. 8 J K- 1 mol(- 1), much lower than that predicted from calorimetric measurements on the liquid phase and theoretical calculations on the gas phase. The conversion of the high temperature vaporization enthalpy to 298 K was discussed and the value Delta H-g(l) m(298 K) = (128. 6 +/- 1. 3) kJ mol(- 1) assessed on the basis of data from literature and present work. Vapor pressure data were also processed by the third-law procedure using different estimations for the auxiliary thermal functions, and a Delta H-g(l) m(298 K) consistent with the assessed value was obtained, although the overall agreement is sensitive to the accuracy of heat capacity data. KEMS measurements were carried out in the lower temperature range (393 - 467) K and showed that the largely prevailing ion species is BMIm(+), supporting the common view of BMImNTf(2) vaporizing as individual, neutral ion pairs also under equilibrium conditions. By monitoring the mass spectrometric signal of this ion as a function of temperature, a second-law Delta H-g(l) m(298 K) of 129. 4 +/- 7. 3 kJ mol(- 1) was obtained, well consistent with KEML and literature results. Finally, by combining KEML and KEMS measurements, the electron impact ionization cross section of BMIm(+) was estimated...|$|R

Monte Carlo {{techniques}} were {{used to evaluate the}} flow of molecules through an ideal <b>orifice</b> (<b>effusion)</b> as predicted by isotropy-failure theory. Binary collisions of molecules were treated using classical mechanics with random numbers used for molecular speeds, directions, and recoil angles. Isotropy-failure theory was applied to give the dependence on pressure of the gas. Isotropy-failure theory assumes that the probability of escape is increased by the absence of the container wall where the orifice is located. The simulation was performed for Ar at 1000 K for 10 (7) collisions. The simulation provided the number of molecules and their speeds in the orifice direction {{as a function of the}} isotropy-failure parameter domega/ 2 pi (related to the Knudsen number defined as the mean-free path divided by orifice diameter). As domega/ 2 pi increased (Knudsen number decreased, pressure increased) the transmission probability of the orifice increased, and the average speed of molecules escaping along the orifice normal increased. The results are compared to experimental results for the orifice transmission probability and speed distribution. peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{expressions}} for {{column number}} density (CND) are developed for optical {{line of sight}} paths {{through a variety of}} steady free molecule point source models including directionally-constrained effusion (Mach number M = 0) and flow from a sonic orifice (M = 1). Sonic orifice solutions are approximate, developed using a fair simulacrum fitted to the free molecule solution. Expressions are also developed for a spherically-symmetric thermal expansion (M = 0). CND solutions are found for the most general paths relative to these sources and briefly explored. It is determined that the maximum CND from a distant location through directed <b>effusion</b> and sonic <b>orifice</b> cases occurs along the path parallel to the source plane that intersects the plume axis. For the effusive case this value is exactly twice the CND found along the ray originating from that point of intersection and extending to infinity along the plume's axis. For sonic plumes this ratio is reduced to about 4 / 3. For high Mach number cases the maximum CND will be found along the axial centerline path.

40|$|Article Outline: A 6 -month-old term infant was {{referred}} {{with a history}} of snuffly breathing and obstructive sleep-disturbed breathing unless she was postured upright. From birth she had had daily right-sided rhinorrhea, which was mostly grayish and of egg-white consistency. It had not responded to antibiotics or intranasal steroids. Feeding was slow but weight gain was normal. Perinatal history was unremarkable, with cigarette smoking 4 per week the only potential teratogen identified. Clinical examination showed a left unilateral middle ear effusion, a left preauricular sinus, a bifid tip of uvula, and ankyloglossia. Flexible transnasal endoscopy demonstrated a pale skin-covered finger-like projection, arising from the left lateral nasopharyngeal wall in close proximity to the Eustachian tube, crossing to the contralateral side. CT showed patent bony choanae bilaterally with a 9 × 7 -mm soft tissue density superior to the soft palate. MRI (T 2 weighting and T 1 fat saturation, pre- and postcontrast) showed a 7 -mm-diameter lesion projecting 12. 5 mm into the pharynx. It was separate to the left internal carotid artery, with slight contrast enhancement. The absence {{of a wide range of}} signal intensities and the ordered structure suggested teratoma unlikely. There appeared to be a cord-like extension with concentric ring structure immediately adjacent to the Eustachian tube, to the skull base postero-inferior to the Eustachian tube. Under general anesthesia a combined transnasal and retropalatal endoscopic approach was commenced. The attachment of the lesion to the mucosa of the anterior aspect of the Eustachian tube was needle-point diathermy-divided under vision and then with steady traction using non-thru-cut forceps the lesion was avulsed from its origin in the postero-inferior aspect of the lower third of the Eustachian tube, and delivered transorally. After removal the size of the left Eustachian tube orifice was seen to be 4 to 5 times that of the right (Fig 1 - Dilated Eustachian tube orifice after removal of hairy polyp). The operative procedure was uncomplicated. The left unilateral mucoid effusion was aspirated. Histopathology demonstrated a 15 × 7 × 7 -mm polypoid lesion covered by epidermis with associated adnexae (hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and eccrine glands) overlying a core of fibroadipose tissue with minor salivary glands and skeletal muscle. This was characterized as a “hairy polyp of the Eustachian tube. ” At general anesthetic for division of the ankyloglossia 5 months postexcision there was no recurrence of either the lesion or the middle ear <b>effusion,</b> and the <b>orifice</b> of the Eustachian tube had shrunk so as to be only a little larger than the contralateral side. Discussion: “Hairy polyp of the nasopharynx” is a clinico-pathological descriptive term. The clinical description derives from macroscopically visible fine hairs arising from the pale external covering of skin (Fig 2 - Hairy polyp of the Eustachian tube). At flexible or rigid transnasal or retropalatal endoscopy they typically appear as a sausage-like lesion projecting medially across the nasopharynx. Up to 2004, 114 cases of hairy polyp of the nasopharynx had been described, most arising from the lateral pharyngeal wall. Origin specifically from the Eustachian tube was thought to be excessively rare but it is quite possible that increasing use of nasal endoscopes before and after removal will show that origin from within the lower end of the Eustachian tube is more common than previously thought. It is presumably this origin that resulted in dilation of the developing cartilaginous Eustachian tube; and removal of the hairy polyp allowed remodeling towards a normal size. They most commonly present early in the first year, with a female preponderance up to 6 : 1. Presentation with nasal signs and symptoms occurs when nasopharyngeal and nasal obstruction predominate, and occurs with otologic signs and symptoms when Eustachian tube obstruction coexists. When larger, the lesions may be visible below the soft palate or acting as a ball-valve may obstruct the larynx causing positional cyanosis; indeed, fatal obstruction has been reported. Several theories of embryologic origin exist. Hairy polyps arising from the Eustachian tube may originate in the fourth postconceptual week from entrapped cells between the first pouch endoderm and first cleft ectoderm. Because they resemble the pinna, they have been postulated to be accessory auricles arising “internally” from the first branchial anlarge. Less likely would seem to be persistence of the bucconasal or buccopharyngeal membranes, or uncontrolled development from entrapped pluripotential cells...|$|R
