[...] On 5 November 2011, Burns took on Katsidis for the WBO interim lightweight championship and despite being the slight underdog went on to win the fight by unanimous decision.

Impulse answered, yes--reflection, no. If I disclosed my real situation, I knew that I must introduce Clara to Margaret. This would necessitate taking her privately to Mr. Sherwin's house, and exposing to her the humiliating terms of dependence and prohibition on which I lived with my own wife. A strange medley of feelings, in which pride was uppermost, forbade me to do that. Then again, to involve my sister in my secret, would be to involve her with me in any consequences which might be produced by its disclosure to my father.

6000|$|He {{could not}} move when he saw his wife coming down the {{stairway}} in the hall. She was in her long, white flannel bed gown, and the candle she carried shook with her nervous tremor. He thought she might be walking in her sleep, but she said, quite simply, [...] "I woke up, and I couldn't git to sleep ag'in without comin' to have a look." [...] She stood beside their dead son with him, [...] "well, he's beautiful, Jacob. He was the prettiest baby! And he was always good, Coonrod was; I'll say that for him. I don't believe he ever <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute's</b> care in his whole life. I reckon I liked him about {{the best of all}} the children; but I don't know as I ever done much to show it. But you was always good to him, Jacob; you always done the best for him, ever since he was a little feller. I used to be afraid you'd spoil him sometimes in them days; but I guess you're glad now for every time you didn't cross him. I don't suppose since the twins died you ever hit him a lick." [...] She stooped and peered closer at the face. [...] "Why, Jacob, what's that there by his pore eye?" [...] Dryfoos saw it, too, the wound that he had feared to look for, and that now seemed to redden on his sight. He broke into a low, wavering cry, like a child's in despair, like an animal's in terror, like a soul's in the anguish of remorse.|$|R

The help I have given you already counts for nothing compared with the help I am {{going to give you}} now. My honor is concerned in bowling out Mrs. Lecount. This last move of hers has made it a personal matter between us. The woman actually thinks she can take me in!!!"

6000|$|Some {{thirty-five years}} ago, in New York city, at Tammany hall, of which place I {{was then a}} frequenter, I happen'd to become quite well acquainted with Thomas Paine's perhaps most {{intimate}} chum, and certainly his later years' very frequent companion, a remarkably fine old man, Col. Fellows, who may yet be remember'd by some stray relics of that period and spot. If you will allow me, I will first give {{a description of the}} Colonel himself. He was tall, of military bearing, aged about 78, I should think, hair white as snow, clean-shaved on the face, dress'd very neatly, a tail-coat of blue cloth with metal buttons, buff vest, pantaloons of drab color, and his neck, breast and wrists showing the whitest of linen. Under all circumstances, fine manners; a good but not profuse talker, his wits still fully about him, balanced and live and undimm'd as ever. He kept pretty fair health, though so old. For employment--for he was poor--he had a post as constable of some of the upper courts. I used to think him very picturesque on the fringe of a crowd holding a tall staff, with his erect form, and his superb, bare, thick-hair'd, closely-cropt white head. The judges and young lawyers, with whom he was ever a favorite, and the subject of respect, used to call him Aristides. It was the general opinion among them that if manly rectitude and the instincts of absolute justice remain'd vital anywhere about New York City Hall, or Tammany, they were to be found in Col. Fellows. He liked young men, and enjoy'd to leisurely talk with them over a social glass of toddy, after his day's work, (he on these occasions never drank but one glass,) and it was at reiterated meetings of this kind in old Tammany's back parlor of those days, that he told me much about Thomas Paine. At one of our interviews he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> account of Paine's sickness and death. In short, from those talks, I was and am satisfied that my old friend, with his mark'd advantages, had mentally, morally and emotionally gauged the author of [...] "Common Sense," [...] and besides <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> good portrait of his appearance and manners, had taken the true measure of his interior character.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{development}} of the whole northern portion of the prairie country depends {{on the success of}} the experiments that are being made," [...] Singleton went on. [...] "Their summers are hot but short; if they can get a grain that ripens early, they can cultivate vast stretches of land that are now, from economic reasons, uninhabitable, and it would make farming a more prosperous business in other tracts. Crops growing in the favored parts are occasionally frozen. It's a coincidence that a day or two ago I got a letter inquiring about that kind of wheat from a friend in Canada who is, as it happens, farming with a cousin of Lansing's." [...] Then he laughed. [...] "All this, however, {{has nothing to do with}} the object of your visit. <b>Give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> few more <b>minutes</b> to think it over." ...|$|R
60|$|Do you know, {{the first}} thing from without which did me the least good was a letter from America, from dear Mrs. Stowe. Since we parted here in the spring, {{neither of us had}} written, and she had not the least idea of my being unhappy for any reason. In fact, her thought was to congratulate me on public affairs (knowing how keenly I felt about them), but her letter dwelt at length upon spiritualism. She had heard, she said, for the fifth time from her boy (the one who was drowned in that awful manner through {{carrying}} out a college jest) without any seeking on her part. She <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> account of <b>a</b> late manifestation, not seeming to have a doubt in respect to the verity and identity of the spirit. In fact, secret things were told, reference to private papers made, the evidence was considered most satisfying. And she says that all of the communications descriptive of the state of that Spirit, though coming from very different mediums (some high Calvinists and others low infidels) tallied exactly. She spoke very calmly about it, with no dogmatism, but with the strongest disposition to receive the facts of the subject with all their bearings, and at whatever loss of orthodoxy or sacrifice of reputation for common sense. I have a high appreciation of her power of forming opinions, let me add to this. It {{is one of the most}} vital and growing minds I ever knew. Besides the inventive, the critical and analytical faculties are strong with her. How many women do you know who are religious, and yet analyse point by point what they believe in? She lives in the midst of the traditional churches, and is full of reverence by nature; and yet if you knew how fearlessly that woman has torn up the old cerements and taken note of what is a dead letter within, yet preserved her faith in essential spiritual truth, you would feel more admiration for her than even for writing 'Uncle Tom.' There are quantities of irreverent women and men who profess infidelity. But this is a woman of another order, observe, devout yet brave in the outlook for truth, and considering, not whether a thing be sound, but whether it be true. Her views are Swedenborgian on some points, beyond him where he departs from orthodoxy on one or two points, adhering to the orthodox creed on certain others. She used to come to me last winter and open out to me very freely, and I was much interested in the character of her intellect. Dr. Manning tried his converting power on her. 'It might have answered,' she said, 'if one side of her mind had not confuted what the other side was receptive of.' In fact, she caught at all the beauty and truth and good of the Roman Catholic symbolism, saw what was better in it than Protestantism, and also, just as clearly, what was worse. She admired Manning immensely, and was very keen and quick in all her admirations; had no national any more than ecclesiastical prejudices; didn't take up Anglo-Saxon outcries of superiority in morals and the rest, which makes me so sick from American and English mouths. By the way (I must tell Sarianna that for M. Milsand!) a clever Englishwoman (married to a Frenchman) told Robert the other day that she believed in 'a special hell for the Anglo-Saxon race on account of its hypocrisy.'...|$|R
40|$|I guess I just grew {{sick and}} tired of the same old request after almost every {{presentation}} I made at conferences involving developmental psychologists: “Trevor, could you just <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> simple ten <b>minute</b> explanation of what Rasch analysis is all about? ” After a dozen or so inquiries of this nature, I thought there must be a shortcut. A couple of us Piagetians gathered and devel-oped a little web site for developmentalists interested in Rasch analysis. When we tried to sug-gest introductory readings for our colleagues — many of whom had very little explicit training in statistics or quantitative research methodology — we realized that we could not produce the goods. That’s not to deny in any way the importance of the classic Rasch texts — Wright and Stone, Andrich, Wright and Masters, and that of Georg Rasch himself. It highlighted, however, the absence of an introductory text — a text that would take an interested beginner {{to the point of being}} able to participate in the wider Rasch collegial community. So really, I had the plan for the book in my mind for more than a couple of years. And the book would still be just that — plan in my mind — if I hadn’t had the good fortune to meet Christine Fox at a Midwest Objective Measurement Seminar (MOMS) meeting in Chicago. Con...|$|R
