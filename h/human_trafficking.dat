5|$|Also {{included}} in the plan is an outline for raising awareness about <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> across Canada. The plan specifically mentions TruckSTOP, a campaign of Persons Against the Crime of Trafficking in Humans Ottawa, as being integral to the plan. According to the plan, the CBSA is responsible for informing foreigners about <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> because of their increased vulnerability. The plan includes a provision {{for the government to}} partner with NGOs that oppose <b>human</b> <b>trafficking.</b> Although Smith said that <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> would be more effectively combatted if Canada's prostitution laws were reformed to align with those of Sweden, criminalizing the purchasing rather than the selling of sex, the NAP-CHT does not make such legislative recommendations. The plan enables immigration officers to issue temporary residence permits to foreigners victimized by <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> in Canada, thereby providing these victims with opportunities to receive aid.|$|E
5|$|FreeFall Stage {{discouraged}} {{people under the}} age of fifteen from attending because of {{the subject matter of the}} play, but encouraged older teenagers to attend because teenagers are at the greatest risk of being trafficked. Several <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> survivors attended the performances, and other survivors sent the Eldridges messages about their personal experiences with <b>human</b> <b>trafficking.</b> Quandt said that he encountered many audience members who, because of watching the play, became determined to do something to combat <b>human</b> <b>trafficking.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{introduced}} {{training for}} {{police officers and}} anti-human-trafficking service providers in communities that are particularly susceptible to <b>human</b> <b>trafficking.</b> The plan also includes an increase in training for prosecutors, border guards, and judges. The plan launched a nationally integrated law enforcement team tasked specifically with combatting <b>human</b> <b>trafficking,</b> {{the first of its}} kind in Canada. The team combines the forces of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), CBSA, and local police. Due to difficulties encountered by Canadian law enforcement when investigating <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> before the establishment of the NAP-CHT, this model of law enforcement integration, emulating successful teams combatting <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> in the United States, was included. This law enforcement integration model is intended to optimize information sharing and facilitate proactive investigation. The NAP-CHT allocates substantial funds to the RCMP <b>Human</b> <b>Trafficking</b> National Coordination Centre (HTNCC), which is based in Ottawa.|$|E

5|$|Not My Life calls {{attention}} to the fact that, in the United States, the sentencing for <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> is less severe than for drug trafficking. The film indicates a relationship between contemporary slavery and globalization. It asserts that most <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> victims are children, although the filmmakers have recognized the fact that millions of adults are also trafficked. The film depicts <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> as a matter of good and evil, provides interviews with survivors of <b>human</b> <b>trafficking,</b> and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat <b>human</b> <b>trafficking.</b> Bilheimer was sparing in his use of statistics in the film, feeling that overloading viewers with figures might numb them to the issues.|$|E
5|$|Joy Smith, Member of Parliament (MP) for Kildonan—St. Paul {{with the}} Conservative Party, put forward motion C-153 in February 2007 {{to put in}} place a Canada-wide action plan to combat <b>human</b> <b>trafficking,</b> and the House of Commons passed the motion unanimously. Thomas Axworthy of the Toronto Star said that the {{unanimity}} of this decision demonstrated that the Harper government was just as dedicated to opposing <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> as was Barack Obama, President of the United States. Early promoters of a Canadian anti-trafficking action plan hoped for up to $100 million in funding, which they argued would turn Canada into a world leader in the fight against <b>human</b> <b>trafficking.</b> World Vision Canada began lobbying for a national <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> action plan in 2009.|$|E

5|$|As had {{occurred}} with Bilheimer's previous film, A Closer Walk, Not My Life had several preview screenings before its official release.

While {{there are}} men and boys who are trafficked around the world, the United States Department of State (DoS) estimates that about 80% of <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> victims are female, and the film focuses on them. Information is presented from a Christian worldview—despite the subject matter, there is no profanity or nudity in the film, although there are scenes showing alcohol consumption and women wearing skimpy clothing.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious: Merchant of Souls is a 2011 American {{documentary}} film about modern <b>human</b> <b>trafficking,</b> specifically sexual slavery. Presented from a Christian worldview, Nefarious covers <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> in the United States, Western and Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia, alternating interviews with re-enactments. Victims of trafficking talk about having been {{the objects of}} physical abuse and attempted murder. Several former prostitutes talk about their conversion to Christianity, escape from sexual oppression, and subsequent education or marriage. The film ends with the assertion that only Jesus can completely heal people from the horrors of sexual slavery.|$|E
5|$|Denise Wong, the Calgarian {{actor who}} portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, {{said that the}} play was about the human condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with <b>human</b> <b>trafficking,</b> and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century <b>human</b> <b>trafficking.</b> The character of Mama calls {{attention to the fact that}} poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that the play will put a face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play and said that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.|$|E

5|$|For decades Haitians {{have been}} {{crossing}} the Haitian-Dominican border for various reasons, including voluntary and involuntary migration, long- and short-term {{residence in the}} Dominican Republic, legal and illegal entry, smuggling, and <b>human</b> <b>trafficking.</b> Haitians move across the Haitian-Dominican border in search of opportunities and they are highly vulnerable to exploitation. In fact, the Dominican Republic {{has one of the}} worst records of human rights abuses, including <b>human</b> <b>trafficking,</b> against migrant workers in all of the Caribbean. Haitians in the Dominican Republic are widely disparaged as a migrant minority because of the countries' proximity. During the dictatorial reign of Jean-Claude Duvalier in the 1970s and 80s, he sold Haitians at bulk rates to work on sugar plantations in the Dominican Republic.|$|E

5|$|Nefarious was written, directed, produced, and {{narrated by}} Benjamin Nolot, founder and {{president}} of Exodus Cry. Exodus Cry, which distributed the film, is headquartered in Grandview, Missouri and is an organization that opposes <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> by raising awareness, by reintegrating victims back into society, and by prayer. Nolot founded Exodus Cry in 2007 after a woman he did not know gave him , saying that God told her to do so in order that Nolot might found an anti-human-trafficking organization. This was founded at a prayer meeting later that year where attendees prayed for <b>human</b> <b>trafficking</b> victims. The organization claims that this prayer meeting occurred on the day before the announcement of the 2007 international child pornography investigation, which involved approximately 2,400 human-trafficking-related arrests in 77 countries.|$|E
