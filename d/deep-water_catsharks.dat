50|$|The bighead {{catshark}} (Apristurus bucephalus) is {{a species}} of fish in the Scyliorhinidae family endemic to Australia. Its natural habitat is the open seas. It belongs to a genus of poorly known <b>deep-water</b> <b>catsharks,</b> and is recorded from only three specimens taken off Perth, Western Australia. This species could be rare or uncommon, {{and the effects of}} fisheries are unknown, though if its biology is like other deep-water shark species, it may not be sufficiently fecund to withstand exploitation pressures.|$|E
50|$|The roughskin {{catshark}} (Apristurus ampliceps) is {{a species}} of catshark in the Scyliorhinidae family found near Australia and New Zealand. Its natural habitat is the open seas. This species belongs to a genus of poorly known <b>deep-water</b> <b>catsharks.</b> Very little is known of its biology. This species is known to occur in deep water (840 to 1,380 m) off New Zealand, sporadic sites around Tasmania, and a small area of Western Australia. Some concern exists for this species, as its distribution includes some heavily fished areas. Deep-water demersal trawl fisheries are expanding in the region, and assuming its biology is like other deep-water shark species, {{it may not be}} sufficiently fecund to withstand the exploitation pressure.|$|E

50|$|The white ghost {{catshark}} (Apristurus aphyodes) is a shark {{of the family}} Scyliorhinidae found in deep water in the northeast Atlantic between latitudes 57째N and 58째N.A <b>deep-water</b> <b>catshark</b> known from the eastern North Atlantic from depths of 1,014 to 1,800 m, it is known from {{only a limited number}} of specimens. It reaches a maximum of 54 cm total length, but little known of its biology.|$|R
50|$|The ghost {{catshark}} is a demersal (bottom-loving) species living {{just above the}} seabed in deep water in the Atlantic Ocean between 40째 and 60째 North. It is present on the continental slopes off Massachusetts in the United States and on the Porcupine Bank west of Ireland. A reported sighting of the <b>deep-water</b> <b>catshark</b> (Apristurus profundorum) off Mauritania may have in fact been this species. It is also reported from deep water {{in the vicinity of}} Cape Town in South Africa.|$|R
50|$|The pinocchio {{catshark}} (Apristurus australis) is {{a species}} of catshark in the Scyliorhinidae family found in Australia and possibly New Zealand. Its natural habitat is the open seas. It belongs to a genus of poorly known deep-water sharks. Very little is known of its biology. Possibly a widely distributed <b>deep-water</b> <b>catshark</b> found along the Australian continental slope at depths of 590 to 1,000 m, it consists of several distinct populations which may be separate species. Although part of the distribution includes heavily fished areas, particularly off southeastern Australia, much of its range is in unfished areas. Given the taxonomic uncertainty of the separate populations, {{it is not possible}} to assess the conservation status of this species at this time. However, deep-water demersal trawl fisheries are expanding in the region, and the situation should be reassessed following taxonomic clarification.|$|R
