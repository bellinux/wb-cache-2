However, because of semiconductor commutations, they generate fast voltage and current transients (dv/dt and di/dt) {{that are responsible for}} conducted electromagnetic emissions. These perturbations include high-frequency common-mode and differential-mode currents spreading to the power supply and polluting the electrical network. Notably, these emissions may exceed the limits imposed by electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards, and thereby require bulky and expensive <b>EMC</b> <b>filters.</b> These problems can be reduced if EMC analysis is performed by simulation at the design stage of power converters.
