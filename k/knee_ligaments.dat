5|$|Patellar luxation, {{also known}} as luxating patella, is a {{hereditary}} disorder affecting the knees. It is where the kneecap slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place as if nothing has happened. Dogs can {{have a problem with}} both rear knees, and complications can include arthritis or torn <b>knee</b> <b>ligaments.</b> Severe cases can require surgery.|$|E
5|$|As {{the final}} {{was held in}} England, at Wembley, Liverpool were clear favourites to retain the European Cup. Brugge were without {{a number of key}} players, such as Raoul Lambert, whose {{inclusion}} in the Brugge squad was rumoured before the final but never materialised. Liverpool were also without a few players. Tommy Smith, who had scored in the previous season's final, was out after dropping a pick-axe on his foot and breaking a toe. Striker David Johnson was also absent. He had strained <b>knee</b> <b>ligaments</b> during a match against Leicester City, an injury that ruled him out {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E

As a result, Allen had the most productive season of his career, recording 38 tackles, two interceptions, and a sack over 12 regular season games. In August, Allen broke the CFL career record for fumbles recovered for touchdowns when he recovered his fifth blocked punt for a touchdown. Shortly afterward, he missed multiple games due to a sprained ankle. The Blue Bombers lost to the Toronto Argonauts 3–42 in the East Final.|$|E
5|$|Dickov {{retained}} {{his place}} in the first team {{at the start of the}} 1999–2000 season. He started each of the first fifteen League games, despite suffering a facial injury on 26 September 1999 in which he lost a tooth. The run of starting appearances came to an end on 27 October, when he damaged <b>knee</b> <b>ligaments</b> in a match against Ipswich Town. During the subsequent absence, Manchester City signed Robert Taylor, and most of Dickov's appearances in the second half of the season were as a substitute. One of these substitute appearances was the final match of the season, a 4–1 win at Blackburn. Dickov scored the third Manchester City goal as City clinched promotion to the Premier League.|$|E

However, he sustained a knee injury in November 2006, after scoring his first goal {{of the season in}} Leeds' 3–0 home win over Colchester United on 11 November. His return from injury came as a 68th-minute substitute in a 2–1 victory at home to Crystal Palace on 10 February 2007.

5|$|Having {{missed the}} 1959–60 season opener in August, Liddell {{replaced}} Bimpson for the match against Bristol City and scored a brace in a 4–2 win. He had numerous chances {{to complete a}} hat-trick, including two disallowed goals and a penalty taken by Jimmy Melia which the crowd had urged Liddell to take. He retained his place until an injury sustained in September granted Roger Hunt the opportunity to score on his league debut against Scunthorpe. Recurring injury further disrupted Liddell's season after his return against Middlesbrough and damage to <b>knee</b> <b>ligaments</b> in October rendered him unavailable for four months. Phil Taylor resigned in December due to deteriorating performances and was succeeded by Huddersfield's Bill Shankly. After Liddell recovered, Shankly selected him to play against Derby County in February, but the match had to be abandoned because of fog. He completed the next match, against Plymouth Argyle, and played in ten successive games, scoring his final goal for the club in a 5–1 defeat of Stoke in March.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{days after}} leaving Oldham, Beharall joined Carlisle United, with him signing a {{contract}} until July 2006. This {{was the first}} time in his career he played for a non-league club. Beharall made his debut for the club in the 2–2 draw against Gravesend & Northfleet on 12 February 2005. In the 2004–2005 season. Beharall was part of Carlisle's return to the Football League, playing 14 matches (3 of these being playoff matches) and playing 1 FA Trophy match. He scored one Conference goal, in the 2–1 win at Farnborough Town on 2 April 2005. Beharall's pre-season preparations were ruined by an injury which made him miss the start of Carlisle's season, but the MRI scan revealed he had not suffered a tear to any of the major <b>knee</b> <b>ligaments.</b> When he returned from injury in October 2005, Beharall played 6 League and 2 Football League Trophy matches. Most of these appearances came in October and November. However, with the lack of opportunities, Beharall left Carlisle by mutual consent on 1 February 2006.|$|E

He was to be unveiled at a press conference four days later, but this was instead used to announce that the transfer had been postponed over concerns about his fitness, having not played for a month due to problems with his knee. The transfer was then cancelled after PSV refused to agree to further medical tests, and the next day he suffered a rupture to his anterior cruciate <b>knee</b> <b>ligaments</b> during a training session, leaving him injured for a year.|$|E
25|$|Because of a {{succession}} of injuries – affecting his <b>knee</b> <b>ligaments,</b> arm, shoulder and kidney – Wilkinson's international career was severely disrupted. He did not appear again for England until 1,169 days after the 2003 Rugby World Cup triumph, for the opening game of the 2007 Six Nations Championship against Scotland on 3 February 2007. In his comeback international match, Wilkinson scored 27points (a record in the Calcutta Cup) in a full house (scoring points by all four possible methods), and was proclaimed Man of the Match. The following week against Italy, he became the highest point-scorer {{in the history of}} the Five/Six Nations Championship (he has since been overtaken by Ronan O'Gara of Ireland). On 6 October 2007, he also became the highest point-scorer {{in the history of the}} Rugby World Cup, kicking four penalties to overtake Scotland's Gavin Hastings in a quarter-final against Australia.|$|E
25|$|On 12 September 2009, he {{came off}} the bench against Ipswich Town to score two goals after 30 minutes {{of being on the}} pitch, and scored another goal in the same week against Sheffield Wednesday.

25|$|José María López's {{participation}} was under risk after damaging two vertebrae {{in a heavy}} crash at the 6 Hours of Silverstone. He stressed he would take part in Monaco if his doctors gave their consent and hoped {{it would not be}} aggravated enough to prevent him from participating in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. It was reported that Virgin would have their reserve driver Alex Lynn on standby to take over López's seat should the need arise. López was cleared to participate in the event after meeting with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile's medical team following the first practice session's conclusion. Robin Frijns injured his right <b>knee</b> <b>ligaments</b> while training and it forced him to miss the season-opening Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup round at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza. His team Andretti were concerned the injury would be worsened by the mandatory switch to his second car and drafted BMW factory driver Alexander Sims as a replacement if Frijns proved to have further problems. After reporting an handing imbalance in the Mexico City ePrix (possibly due to chassis damage caused by his predecessor Ma Qinghua in multiple crashes), Esteban Gutiérrez received a new Techeetah chassis after the team made a successful request to the stewards to change it.|$|E
500|$|Pronovost's tenure {{with the}} Red Wings {{came to an}} end on May 20, 1965, as he was {{involved}} in an eight-player trade. [...] He was dealt to the Maple Leafs, along with Aut Erickson, Larry Jeffrey, Eddie Joyal and Lowell MacDonald in exchange for Andy Bathgate, Billy Harris and Gary Jarrett. Pronovost, who heard about the trade on the radio before being contacted by either team, was shocked at being dealt away from an organization he played with for 18 years. He adjusted quickly and reached a career milestone early in the 1965–66 season. [...] Pronovost became the seventh player in NHL history to play 1,000 regular season games in a November 28, 1965, contest against the Rangers. He also missed 16 games after suffering strained <b>knee</b> <b>ligaments</b> after colliding with Earl Ingarfield.

[...] The series lacked {{the intensity of the}} original, yet Henderson felt that he played well: he scored two goals and an assist, and though Canada finished with one win, four losses and three ties, he felt the WHA had proven itself. Henderson scored 33 goals and 63 points in the 1974–75 WHA season for the Toros while playing 58 games.
