30|$|The Poisson model {{indicates}} {{that the number of}} segments when students <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>is</b> not different for CoP instructors while controlling for other factors (p =. 52). However, CoP instructors were less likely to have no segments where students <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> (p =. 01). Instructor rank was not related to the number of segments when students <b>were</b> <b>talking.</b> The number of segments when students <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>was</b> 1.6 [1.1, 2.2] times lower for assistant professors (p <. 01); however, there was no difference for associate or full professors (p =. 33). The number of segments when students <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>is</b> not different for foundational courses (p =. 07). Course size was not related to the number of segments when students <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> (p =. 52).|$|R

5|$|Philosophical behaviorism {{has fallen}} out of favor since {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of cognitivism.

5|$|Around 52 {{minutes and}} 47 seconds into the film, when Shatner <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> {{about the other}} Original Series actors disliking him, he shifts {{in his chair and}} a sound evocative of {{flatulence}} is audible. This sound, apparently unnoticed by the filmmakers, was first mentioned in the media by Adam Buckman in the New York Post on October 10, 2001. Buckman wrote that he played the sound for more than six colleagues who all agreed that it came from Shatner. This scene became a popular subject of flatulence humor among Star Trek fans and on morning zoo radio programs. Reviewers identified as many as six other similar noises in Mind Meld, between the 52-minute mark and the end.|$|E

Pete tells her he is okay with this, since all he wants is for her to be happy. Emboldened by this, she gives him a kiss, runs back up to Andy's office, and breaks up with him. In her brief breakup speech she repeats her complaints about his three-month absence, not realizing that he <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> to David Wallace on speakerphone.|$|E

At the end of the story, an anonymous man <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> to his wife about two strangers he picked up on a trip to Tennessee, recounting that the woman had a child and the man was not the father. This was Lena and Byron, who were conducting a half-hearted search for Brown, and they are eventually dropped off in Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs to have some idea of what it might be looking at or what it <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E
