5|$|Most fungi grow as <b>hyphae,</b> {{which are}} cylindrical, thread-like {{structures}} 2–10µm {{in diameter and}} up to several centimeters in length. <b>Hyphae</b> grow at their tips (apices); new <b>hyphae</b> are typically formed by emergence of new tips along existing <b>hyphae</b> by a process called branching, or occasionally growing hyphal tips fork, giving rise to two parallel-growing <b>hyphae.</b> <b>Hyphae</b> also sometimes fuse when they come into contact, a process called hyphal fusion (or anastamosis). These growth processes {{lead to the development}} of a mycelium, an interconnected network of <b>hyphae.</b> <b>Hyphae</b> can be either septate or coenocytic. Septate <b>hyphae</b> are divided into compartments separated by cross walls (internal cell walls, called septa, that are formed at right angles to the cell wall giving the hypha its shape), with each compartment containing one or more nuclei; coenocytic <b>hyphae</b> are not compartmentalized. Septa have pores that allow cytoplasm, organelles, and sometimes nuclei to pass through; an example is the dolipore septum in fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota. Coenocytic <b>hyphae</b> are in essence multinucleate supercells.|$|E
5|$|The capillitium {{refers to}} coarse, late-maturing, {{thick-walled}} {{cells in the}} gleba that develop pores or slits in their thick secondary walls. The capillitial <b>hyphae</b> are 1.5–9.5µm wide, thick-walled, often with a narrow lumen, and with or without surface ornamentation. The columella <b>hyphae</b> are 1.5–14µm wide (occasionally wider, up to 34µm), thick-walled, often with narrow lumen. Single thin-walled, about 1.5µm wide <b>hyphae</b> with clamps can be observed. The endoperidial <b>hyphae</b> are densely interwoven, thick-walled, and about 2–6µm wide. The whitish powder on newly expanded specimens consists of crystalline matter and thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, branched <b>hyphae</b> with clamps. The peristome <b>hyphae</b> are thick-walled, 2–11µm wide. The pseudoparenchymatous layer is built up by bladder-like, thin-walled <b>hyphae</b> of varying size. On the surface of newly expanded specimens crystals and thin-walled <b>hyphae</b> {{of the same kind}} as on the endoperidium are present. The crystals are calcium oxalate dihydrate that have the crystalline structure of a pyramid, and are arranged singly or in loose aggregates, 11 to 30µm in size. The fibrous layer has thick-walled <b>hyphae</b> 1.5–4µm wide. The mycelial layer in the inner, very thin part (seen as a glossy lining on the fibrous layer of newly expanded fruit bodies) consists of a dense web of thin-walled, 1.5–4µm wide, clamped <b>hyphae.</b> Thick-walled <b>hyphae</b> are also present, measuring 2–11 (sometimes up to 19)µm wide. The outer part (the mycelial cup) consists of thick-walled, branched and densely interwoven <b>hyphae</b> (often with a narrow lumen) that measure 1.5–4µm wide.|$|E
5|$|The main {{structure}} of the fruit body consists primarily of an agglutination (mass) of interwoven skeletal <b>hyphae,</b> which are golden- to rust-brown. The <b>hyphae</b> are unbranched, forming long tubes 2 to 3.6μm in diameter, enveloping a lumen of variable thickness. There are also hyaline generative <b>hyphae.</b> These <b>hyphae</b> have thinner walls than the skeletal <b>hyphae,</b> and are also septate (possessing of septa), but are sometimes branched. They measure 2 to 3μm in diameter. The flesh, again, is primarily made up of skeletal <b>hyphae</b> with some generative <b>hyphae.</b> The thick-walled skeletal <b>hyphae</b> are a yellow-brown to rust brown, and are slightly less agglutinate. The <b>hyphae</b> in the flesh are a little smaller; the skeletal <b>hyphae</b> measure 1.8 to 3.4μm in diameter, while the generative <b>hyphae</b> measure 1.5 to 2.6μm in diameter.|$|E
40|$|Trichophyton rubrum {{is one of}} {{dermatophytes}} that penetrates keratinized tissues such as skin, {{hair and}} nail of human and animals. Recently, antifungal drugs such as imodazole and triazole was found to cause side effects, toxicity to patients and also not very efficient due to resistance to these drugs. As an alternative, some plants extract {{had been used to}} treat dermatophytes. This studies was done using Garlic extract (Allium sativum) to evaluate its effects on the growth of <b>hypha</b> of Trichophyton using Electron miscroscopy. Garlic had been known to posses antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, antithrombotic and antitumor activities. This studies found that garlic extract as low as 4 mg/mL inhibit the growth of <b>hypha.</b> Scanning electron microscopy studies revealed that <b>hypha</b> treated with garlic extract showed shrinkage, flat and cell wall demolition, similar to <b>hypha</b> treated with allicin (positive control) having rough surface, shrinkage and distortion. The tip of hypa became large after treatment with garlic extract. Transmission electron microscopy studies also found that <b>hypha</b> treated with allicin display cell wall thickening, local thickening, destruction of cytoplasmic content, mean while <b>hypha</b> treated with garlic extract exhibited cell wall thickening, disordered hyphal tip and desolution of cytoplasmic compartments and similar with <b>hypha</b> treated with allicin.

40|$|Objective(s) : Trichophyton rubrum (T. rubrum) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{dermatophytes}} worldwide. This fungus invaded skin appendages of humans and animals. Recently, resistance to antifungal drugs as well as appearance of side effects due to indication of these kinds of antibiotics has been reported. Besides, using some plant extracts have been indicated in herbal medicine as an alternative treatment of these fungal infections. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Garlic (Allium sativum) and pure allicin on the growth of <b>hypha</b> in T. rubrum using Electron miscroscopy. Materials and Methods:This study was carried out to observe the morphological changes of T. rubrum treated with allicin as well as aqueous garlic extract using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: SEM surveys, showed that <b>hypha</b> treated with allicin has rough and granular like surface, abnormal and irregularly-shape. However, <b>hypha</b> treated with garlic extract had rough and fluffy surface and also irregularly-shape. TEM studies also found that <b>hypha</b> treated with allicin displays disintegration of cytoplasm, breaking down in cell membrane and the cell wall, and collapsing of <b>hypha,</b> meanwhile <b>hypha</b> treated with garlic extract exhibiting degradation and dissolution of cytoplasm components, demolition of cell wall and cell membrane, and <b>hypha</b> appeared to break. Conclusion: The present study revealed that pure allicin (6. 25 µg/ml and 12. 5 µg/ml) is more efficient in inhibition of the growth in hyphal cells compare to the garlic extract (2 mg/ml and 4 mg/ml) and they could be used as alternatives in treatment of dermatophytosis...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to various extracellular signals, the morphology {{of the human}} fungal pathogen Candida albicans switches from yeast to <b>hypha</b> form. Here, we report that GPR 1 encoding a putative G-protein-coupled receptor and GPA 2 encoding a Gα subunit are required for <b>hypha</b> formation and morphogenesis in C. albicans. Mutants lacking Gpr 1 (gpr 1 /gpr 1) or Gpa 2 (gpa 2 /gpa 2) are defective in <b>hypha</b> formation and morphogenesis on solid hypha-inducing media. These phenotypic defects in solid cultures are suppressed by exogenously added dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (dibutyryl-cAMP). Biochemical studies also reveal that GPR 1 and GPA 2 are required for a glucose-dependent increase in cellular cAMP. An epistasis analysis indicates that Gpr 1 functions upstream of Gpa 2 in the same signaling pathway, and a two-hybrid assay reveals that the carboxyl-terminal tail of Gpr 1 interacts with Gpa 2. Moreover, expression levels of HWP 1 and ECE 1, which are cAMP-dependent hypha-specific genes, are reduced in both mutant strains. These findings support a model that Gpr 1, as well as Gpa 2, regulates <b>hypha</b> formation and morphogenesis in a cAMP-dependent manner. In contrast, GPR 1 and GPA 2 are not required for <b>hypha</b> formation in liquid fetal bovine serum (FBS) medium. Furthermore, the gpr 1 and the gpa 2 mutant strains are fully virulent in a mouse infection. These findings suggest that Gpr 1 and Gpa 2 {{are involved in the}} glucose-sensing machinery that regulates morphogenesis and <b>hypha</b> formation in solid media via a cAMP-dependent mechanism, but they are not required for <b>hypha</b> formation in liquid medium or during invasive candidiasis...|$|R
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare can {{be grown}} in pure culture on agar-containing plates {{supplemented}} with nutrients. The colonies that grow are white to pale cream, and cover the agar surface within six weeks from the initial inoculation. The mycelium is made of bent-over <b>hyphae,</b> without any aerial <b>hyphae</b> (<b>hyphae</b> that extend above {{the surface of the}} agar). Typically, two indistinct zones develop at about 6mm and 15mm from the initial inoculum spot, with each zone roughly 4mm wide. The zones appear somewhat lighter in color because the <b>hyphae</b> are more closely packed and form crystalline substances that deposit into the agar.|$|E
5|$|Examination of fruiting bodies using {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} and transmission electron microscopy has revealed details about their ultrastructure—their microscopic architecture and arrangement. For example, the <b>hyphae</b> of the hapteron form a dense tangled network, while the <b>hyphae</b> of the funicular cord are arranged in a twisted form like a rope. Further, the funicular cord, known to be highly elastic and with a high tensile strength, is made of thicker <b>hyphae</b> {{than the rest of}} the funiculus. Also, the ecto- and endoperidium are made of thick-walled, unbranched <b>hyphae,</b> known as skeletal <b>hyphae.</b> It has been proposed that these skeletal <b>hyphae</b> form a structural network that helps the fruiting body maintain the elasticity vital for proper functioning of the spore dispersal mechanism.|$|E
