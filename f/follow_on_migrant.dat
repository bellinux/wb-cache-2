30|$|Second, {{citizenship}} regimes have {{an impact}} on the collective identities of the migrants and the framing of their claims. Political opportunity structures, for instance, are assumed to be decisive for migrants’ choices on whether to make claims along the categories of ‘migrants’, ‘foreigners’ or ‘national and ethnic minorities’. Hence, it could also be argued that while open citizenship regimes trigger some forms of political mobilization they negatively impact <b>on</b> <b>migrant</b> protest among which protest along migrant group boundaries. In this sense it is not entirely clear in which direction citizenship regimes impact <b>on</b> <b>migrant</b> protest according to the theory. What is clear, however, is that narrow POS expects citizenship regimes to have some impact <b>on</b> <b>migrant</b> protest.|$|R

30|$|The {{scientific}} literature <b>on</b> ethnic (<b>migrant,</b> minority, coloured) entrepreneurship is vast. Starting in the USA, {{in the past}} few decades research on this issue has boomed. Migrant entrepreneurship studies focussed sometimes on specific ethnic groups (e.g., Chinese, Indians), sometimes on social bonds between <b>migrant</b> communities, sometimes <b>on</b> ethnic product markets, sometimes on urban-economic melting pot phenomena, and sometimes <b>on</b> <b>migrant</b> business strategies. In recent years, a real avalanche of literature has been published <b>on</b> <b>migrant</b> entrepreneurship, too much to be covered and reviewed in this present article. For some recent overviews, we refer to Kloosterman and Rath (2001), Oliveira and Rath (2008), Baycan-Levent et al. (2004), Dana (2006), Sahin et al. (2009) and Sahin (2012).|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{self-employment}} among migrant minorities {{has increased}} {{significantly in the}} Netherlands. The phenomenon of ‘migrant entrepreneurship’ (ME) refers to business activities undertaken by migrants with a specific socio-cultural and ethnic background or migrant origin. ME distinguishes itself from ‘normal’ entrepreneurship through its orientation <b>on</b> <b>migrant</b> products, <b>on</b> <b>migrant</b> market customers, or <b>on</b> indigenous <b>migrant</b> business strategies. Migrant groups that produce a strong entrepreneurial group can be of great economic significance for the migrant business community, {{as well as for}} the community as a whole, through job and opportunity creation. The recent literature has documented that migrant businesses are one of the fastest growing sectors in the Dutch economy. However, knowledge and information that documents entrepreneurial differences between migrants is lagging far behind this rapid growth. Previous research has mainly focused on knowledge of native entrepreneurs that mainly informs policy, education and research. Against this background, the present study aims to investigate entrepreneurial similarities and differences from a multicultural perspective <b>on</b> <b>migrant</b> entrepreneurs. In our study we particularly focus on four active and prominent migrant groups, viz. Turks, Moroccans, Surinamese and Antilleans, in the Netherlands. First, we give a brief historical...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the 7 -year {{longitudinal}} {{study was to examine}} the College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP), a student services intervention, to determine its impact <b>on</b> <b>migrant</b> student achievement in the California State University (CSU) system.

The comparison groups were Latinos and other students from the general student population for a total of 9, 362 student level data records. The study intended to address one overarching research question: Does the CAMP intervention have an impact <b>on</b> <b>migrant</b> student achievement? The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Chi-Square Test of Independence were used to explore differences among CAMP, Latino, and other students from the general population. The variables used to determine academic achievement included persistence, first year and cumulative grade point average, and baccalaureate degree attainment. Data findings reported CAMP was having a positive impact <b>on</b> <b>migrant</b> student participants enrolled in the program...|$|R

30|$|Because {{historical}} {{comparative analysis}} of migrant behavior suffers from considerable data restraints, testing causal relations {{is not an}} easy task. What makes empirical analysis in this field particularly demanding is that the data <b>on</b> <b>migrants</b> suffers from the fact that national authorities have only recently begun to make use of categories that mirror a meaningful operationalization of migration status (Jacobs et al., 2009). Data on foreigners has often been used to approach facts that concern migrants. As has regularly been remarked, however, such data is of little use in comparative studies <b>on</b> <b>migrants.</b> This empirical test, therefore, makes use of data on foreign-born residents whenever possible.|$|R
