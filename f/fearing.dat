The patient usually immediately recoils from it, and as he/she does, he/she adds a second <b>fear</b> to the first.

40|$|We {{recently}} developed a procedure to study <b>fear</b> incubation in which rats given 100 tone-shock pairings over 10 days show low <b>fear</b> 2 days after conditioned <b>fear</b> training and high <b>fear</b> after 30 days. Notably, <b>fear</b> 2 days after 10 sessions of <b>fear</b> conditioning {{is lower than}} <b>fear</b> seen 2 days after a single session of <b>fear</b> conditioning, suggesting that <b>fear</b> is suppressed. Here, we investigate the potential role of CB 1 receptor activation by endocannabinoids in this <b>fear</b> suppression. We gave rats 10 days of <b>fear</b> conditioning and then gave systemic injections of the CB 1 receptor antagonist SR 141716 before a conditioned <b>fear</b> test conducted 2 days later under extinction conditions. A second test was conducted without any injections {{on the following day}} (3 days post-training) to examine <b>fear</b> extinction retention. SR 141716 injections did not increase <b>fear</b> expression 2 days after extended <b>fear</b> conditioning or affect within-session extinction, but impaired retention of between-session <b>fear</b> extinction in the day 3 test. These data suggest that CB 1 receptor activation is not suppressing <b>fear</b> soon after extended <b>fear</b> conditioning in the <b>fear</b> incubation task. The data also add to an existing literature on the effects of CB 1 receptors in extinction of conditioned <b>fear...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{definitive}} version may {{be found}} at www. wiley. comOBJECTIVES: People with dental <b>fear</b> often suffer from other psychological disorders, {{as well as from}} a number of other specific <b>fears.</b> <b>Fear</b> of going to the dentist may be associated not only with general fearfulness, but also with underlying personality dispositions. This exploratory study, therefore, investigated the associations between dental <b>fear</b> and 67 other specific <b>fears,</b> general fearfulness, disgust sensitivity and harm sensitivity. METHODS: Participants were 88 Australian adults who were administered the <b>Fear</b> Survey Schedule III (FSS-III), the Harm Sensitivity Index and the Disgust Sensitivity Index. Principle axis factor analysis with Promax rotation was used to examine how dental <b>fear</b> related to other specific <b>fears</b> as measured with the FSS-III. RESULTS: Dental <b>fear</b> was significantly correlated with most of the other specific <b>fears,</b> with factor analysis indicating that it tended to load more with <b>fears</b> related to lack of control rather than with what have often been classed as 'medical' <b>fears.</b> Significant associations were found between dental <b>fear</b> and the personality dispositions of general fearfulness, harm sensitivity and disgust sensitivity, although these associations were not linear. CONCLUSIONS: Findings reveal extensive co-occurrence of other specific <b>fears</b> with dental <b>fear,</b> while the associations of dental <b>fear</b> with personality traits suggest enduring aspects to dental <b>fear</b> which may translate into difficulties in <b>fear</b> alleviation. Dental <b>fear</b> was more related to a diverse range of <b>fears</b> relating to a loss of control than to medical-specific <b>fears.</b> Jason M. Armfiel...|$|R
