25|$|Although the {{majority}} of studies on bilingual sentence processing are focused on L2 processing, {{there are still a}} few studies that have investigated cross-language activation during their native language (L1) reading. For example, van Assche et al. replicated the cognate effect in L1 with Dutch-English bilinguals, and found that a non-dominant language may affect native-language sentence reading, both at earliest and at later reading stages. Titone et al. observed this cross-language activation in English-French bilinguals at <b>early</b> <b>reading</b> stages only when the L2 was acquired early in life. They also concluded that the semantic constraint provided by a sentence can attenuate cross-language activation at later reading stages.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Phase Change Memory (PCM) is an {{emerging}} memory technology that can enable scalable high-density main memory systems. Unfortunately, PCM has higher read latency than DRAM, resulting in lower system performance. This paper investigates architectural techniques {{to improve the}} read latency of PCM. We observe {{that there is a}} wide distribution in cell resistance in both the SET state and the RESET state, and that the read latency of PCM is designed conservatively to handle the worst case cell. If PCM sensing can be tuned to exploit the variability in cell resistance, then we can get reduced read latency. We propose two schemes to enable better-than-worst-case read latency for PCM systems. Our first proposal, <b>Early</b> <b>Read,</b> <b>reads</b> the data <b>earlier</b> than the specified time period. Our key observation that <b>Early</b> <b>Read</b> causes only unidirectional errors (SET being read as RESET) allows us to efficiently detect data errors using Berger codes. In the uncommon case that <b>Early</b> <b>Read</b> causes data error(s), we simply retry the read operation with original latency. Our evaluations show that <b>Early</b> <b>Read</b> can reduce the read latency by 25 % while incurring a storage overhead of only 10 bits per 64 byte line. Our second proposal, Turbo Read, reduces the sensing time for read operations by pumping higher current, at the expense of accidentally switching the PCM cell with small probability during the read operation. We analyze Error Correction Codes (ECC) and Probabilistic Row Scrubbing (PRS) for maintaining data integrity under Turbo Read. We show that a combination of <b>Early</b> <b>Read</b> and Turbo Read can reduce the PCM read latency by 30 %, improve the system performance by 21 %, and reduce the Energy Delay Product (EDP) by 28 %, while requiring minimal changes to the memory system...|$|R

25|$|The {{results of}} this study show that the {{earliest}} age at which children can discriminate well-formed from ill-formed sentences, as well as correct these, is at 6 years. During the critical period between 4 and 6 years old, there is {{a significant increase in the}} accuracy of grammaticality judgments, since metalinguistic skill is in critical development; the judgment relies on the psycholinguistic ability of the child to access their internalized grammar and to compute whether it can or cannot generate the target sentence. This ability to judge the grammaticality of sentences seems to develop in children well after basic grammar skills have been established, and is related to <b>early</b> <b>reading</b> acquisition—acquisitionists generally believe that the ability to make grammaticality judgments is a measure of syntactic awareness.|$|E
25|$|Traditional phonics {{instruction}} has marked benefits. <b>Early</b> <b>reading</b> {{often involves}} significant expansion of a child's mental lexicon, which includes {{all the words}} the child has been exposed to and their meanings. By focusing {{on the principle of}} linking specific sounds and characters, the child has the ability to recognize new words and derive meaning from them. Being able to adapt what they know about language to new words they experience is crucial to expanding their mental lexicon; this allows for productive reading that is the ability to read new words. It also produces higher achievement for beginning readers and the difference is the greatest for those at risk of failing to learn to read. While some children are able to infer these rules on their own, some need explicit instructions on phonics rules. Overall, children who are directly taught phonics are better at reading, spelling and comprehension.|$|E

Under Malach's leadership, ACS continued to experiment and innovate. Despite widespread skepticism among contemporary educators that kindergartners were ready to read, ACS launched an <b>early</b> <b>reading</b> program in the early 1960s. Malach's stance was that [...] "we don't believe a child should be taught because he or she is now 6 years old or in 1st grade. Our children begin to learn to read when the teacher determines the child is ready. Then the teacher works individually with the child at his or her own pace." [...] By this time, however, the once-radical ideas of progressive education had become [...] "conventional wisdom" [...] and kindergarten was a ubiquitous feature of American public schools. As part of Malach's [...] "bid to reforge the leadership role that Avery Coonley School had played during its early years", ACS joined the Independent Schools Association of the Central States (ISACS) in 1961. ISACS was founded in 1908 to promote best practices in independent schools, and instituted a mandatory accreditation program for member schools in 1961. Avery Coonley served as the headquarters of ISACS from 1970 until the central office was dissolved in 2000.|$|E
