5|$|Following the {{scorched}} earth {{tactics of}} retreating Wehrmacht troops, large areas in Northern Norway {{needed to be}} rebuilt. In 1945, there was an overwhelming need for housing. An architectural competition produced several designs for simple, cost-effective, and rapidly assembled housing. The resulting houses were Spartan and broke with building standards, but met an immediate need <b>for</b> <b>shelter.</b>|$|E
5|$|It prefers basins {{and desert}} areas vegetated with Chinese {{tamarisk}} (Tamarix chinensis), brush, or poplar (Populus), along the peripheries of rivers {{that surround the}} mountains in the Taklamakan Desert. This distribution of the Yarkand hare is ring shaped. It also uses reed vegetation along rivers <b>for</b> <b>shelter,</b> and tends to avoid agricultural fields. About 200,000 individuals are estimated to inhabit the Tarim Basin.|$|E

5|$|The {{habitat of}} the splendid fairywren ranges from forest to dry scrub, {{generally}} with ample vegetation <b>for</b> <b>shelter.</b> Unlike the eastern superb fairywren, {{it has not}} adapted well to human occupation of the landscape and has disappeared from some urbanised areas. The splendid fairywren mainly eats insects and supplements its diet with seeds.|$|E
5|$|The superb fairy-wren can {{be found}} in almost any area that has at least a little dense {{undergrowth}} <b>for</b> <b>shelter,</b> including grasslands with scattered shrubs, moderately thick forest, woodland, heaths, and domestic gardens. It has adapted well to the urban environment and is common in suburban Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. The superb fairy-wren eats mostly insects and supplements its diet with seeds.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to national aid, various countries {{and human rights}} related organizations provided varying forms of assistance. The United States provided $25,000 in cash plus an additional $40,000 to help school re-construction and $540,000 to help re-build destroyed homes. Norway donated almost $80,000. The United Nations Development Programme awarded $30,000. UNICEF granted $50,000 worth of medicine. The Catholic Relief Services donated $65,000, with the intended use <b>for</b> <b>shelter,</b> food, and medicine. CARE also contributed $12,300 in order to repair a water tank and schools.|$|E

5|$|Individual sharks choose sites {{giving them}} the best ambush success. They prefer {{junctions}} of sandy and rocky substrates near reefs (used by many fishes <b>for</b> <b>shelter)</b> usually orienting themselves either toward or parallel to nearby vertical structures. They tend to face upslope, which may facilitate burying via falling sediment, bring more fish swimming downstream from the reef, or ease targeting by silhouetting prey against the sunlight.|$|E
5|$|One winter's night, an enchantress {{disguised}} as a beggar offers a cold-hearted prince a rose in exchange <b>for</b> <b>shelter.</b> When he refuses, she transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects. She bestows the Beast with a magic mirror before hexing the rose and warning him that, unless he learns to love another and earns their love in return {{by the time the}} last petal falls, he and his servants will lose their humanity forever.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{damage from}} the storm totaled {{approximately}} $7 million, of which about $4 million {{can be attributed to}} the destruction of crops, notably rice and cotton. The hurricane affected the southern Louisiana region one week before the Louisiana Maneuvers, a series of military exercises held during August and September 1941. The exercise was designed to test US troop training, logistics, doctrine, and commanders and is considered a prelude to World War II. The rainfall triggered flooding and swelled rivers, and army vehicles became stuck in the mud as a result. Hundreds of military aircraft were forced to move inland <b>for</b> <b>shelter.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Arabian {{developed}} in a desert climate and was prized by the nomadic Bedouin people, often being brought inside the family tent <b>for</b> <b>shelter</b> and protection from theft. Selective breeding for traits including an ability to form a cooperative relationship with humans created a horse breed that is good-natured, quick to learn, and willing to please. The Arabian also developed the high spirit and alertness needed in a horse used for raiding and war. This combination of willingness and sensitivity requires modern Arabian horse owners to handle their horses with competence and respect.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{began to}} {{undertake}} training support duties for {{units in the}} process of mobilization and de-mobilization. It was also tasked to provide support for local authorities in the event of peacetime crises and natural disasters. Soldiers of the brigade also participated in assistance with community projects around the Fort Riley community, including repairing and refurbishing run down properties <b>for</b> <b>shelter</b> house projects as well as disabled veterans. After two years of duty, the brigade was inactivated on 16 October 1999 at Fort Riley, Kansas.|$|E
5|$|The first Ancient Hawaiians {{to arrive}} on Hawaii island lived along the shores, where {{food and water}} were plentiful. Settlement {{expanded}} inland to the Mauna Loa – Mauna Kea region in the 12th and early 13th centuries. Archaeological evidence suggests that these regions were used for hunting, collecting stone material, and possibly for spiritual reasons or for astronomical or navigational observations. The mountain's plentiful forest provided plants and animals for food and raw materials <b>for</b> <b>shelter.</b> Flightless birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source.|$|E

50|$|The Shoebox Project <b>for</b> <b>Shelters</b> {{was founded}} in 2011 by Caroline Mulroney Lapham, Jessica Mulroney, Katy Mulroney, and Vanessa Mulroney. The idea for the charity stemmed from the efforts of Jessica’s mother to collect {{donations}} <b>for</b> <b>shelters</b> in Montreal. The sisters-in-law decided to do a similar initiative to benefit the Red Door Family Shelter in Toronto. Their original goal was 156 Shoeboxes, but they surpassed this and collected 400 Shoeboxes which were distributed to 4 local <b>shelters</b> in time <b>for</b> the holidays.|$|R
5|$|The most {{widespread}} {{species is}} the brown bear, which occurs from Western Europe eastwards through Asia {{to the western}} areas of North America. The American black bear is restricted to North America, and the polar bear is restricted to the Arctic Sea. All the remaining species of bear are Asian. They occur {{in a range of}} habitats which include tropical lowland rainforest, both coniferous and broadleaf forests, prairies, steppes, montane grassland, alpine scree slopes, Arctic tundra {{and in the case of}} the polar bear, ice floes. Bears may dig their dens in hillsides or use caves, hollow logs and dense vegetation <b>for</b> <b>shelter.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{exploring}} Treasure Planet's forests, the fugitives meet B.E.N., {{an abandoned}} robot, {{who says he}} has literally lost his primary memory and invites them to his place <b>for</b> <b>shelter.</b> The pirates corner the group here; using a back-door, Jim, B.E.N. and Morph return to the ship in an attempt to recover the map. Scroop attacks them but gets drifted into space. They obtain the map, however, on return, they are caught by Silver, who already captured Doppler and Amelia.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Sag Harbor, NY114 {{encounters}} a modern roundabout {{at the intersection}} of Short Beach Road (County Route60 or CR60) and Tyndall Road. NY114 makes a turn through the roundabout and then travels one more mile through North Haven before reaching the first of two ferries along its route. Shelter Island's two ferries, both of which technically carry NY114, are operated by two different companies. The South Ferry (between North Haven and Shelter Island) is operated by the South Ferry Company and the North Ferry (between Shelter Island Heights and Greenport) is operated by the North Ferry Company. Since the two entities are separate, there is no incentive to use both ferries, although both companies offer discounts for round trip fares and <b>for</b> <b>Shelter</b> Island residents.|$|E

5|$|Burrowing seabirds such as petrels, prions, and shearwaters {{share the}} tuatara's island habitat during the birds' nesting seasons. The tuatara use the birds' burrows <b>for</b> <b>shelter</b> when available, or dig their own. The seabirds' guano helps to {{maintain}} invertebrate populations on which tuatara predominantly prey; including beetles, crickets, and spiders. Their diets also consist of frogs, lizards, and bird's eggs and chicks. The eggs and young of seabirds that are seasonally available as food for tuatara may provide beneficial fatty acids. Tuatara {{of both sexes}} defend territories, and will threaten and eventually bite intruders. The bite can cause serious injury. Tuatara will bite when approached, and will not let go easily.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} era, Lara's story {{was changed to}} be the {{daughter}} of archaeologist Lord Richard Croft, the Earl of Abbingdon, and someone who was quickly identified as a highly talented individual while attending the Abbingdon Girls School. The plane crash was changed to when Lara was nine years old, and with her mother, Amelia Croft. While searching <b>for</b> <b>shelter,</b> Lara and her mother took refuge in an ancient Nepalese temple, where Lara witnesses her mother vanish after tampering with an ancient sword. Her father later disappears {{in search of his}} wife. This spurs Lara on to seek the reason for her mother's disappearance.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} caused {{flooding in}} the state of Veracruz. Thousands of people were forced from their homes as rivers rose, including upwards of 30,000fleeing <b>for</b> <b>shelter</b> after the Tuxpan River exceeded its bank. About 8,000residents of the city of Álamo were rendered homeless. Flooding in Poza Rica forced the rescue of dozens of people from their cars and homes. Several homes in the city were swept away, while debris such as tree branches and trash blocked water runoff. Water, mudslides, and rocks blocked numerous roads in the area. In combination with Hurricane Kristy in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 50,000people were left homeless in Mexico. At least 20fatalities were attributed to Debby.|$|E
