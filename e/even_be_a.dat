25|$|Without overstating it (and without fully {{defending}} it) {{not only}} is there a consensus about the need for a conception of the good, there may <b>even</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> consensus about the particular conception of the good that should inform policies on these nonconstitutional political issues. Communitarians endorse civic republicanism {{and a growing number of}} liberals endorse some version of deliberative democracy. Both envision a need for citizens who are independent and responsible and for public forums that present citizens with opportunities to enter into public deliberations on social policies.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{serving as a}} countermeasure to prey adaptation, pursuit predation has evolved in some species as an alternative, facultative mechanism for foraging. For example, polar bears typically act as specialized predators of seal pups and operate in a manner closely predicted by the optimal foraging theory. However, they have been seen to occasionally employ more energy-inefficient pursuit predation tactics on flightless geese. This alternative predatory strategy {{may serve as a}} back-up resource when optimal foraging is circumstantially impossible, or may <b>even</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> function of filling dietary needs.|$|E
25|$|The tribal name is {{therefore}} {{likely to be}} the origin of Kernow or later Curnow used for Cornwall in the Cornish language. John Morris suggested that a contingent of the Cornovii was sent to South West Britain {{at the end of the}} Roman era, to rule the land there and keep out the invading Irish, but this theory was dismissed by Professor Philip Payton in his book Cornwall: A History. The Cornish Cornovii may <b>even</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> completely separate tribe, taking their name from the horn shape of the peninsula.|$|E

25|$|Ashfield Public is {{the oldest}} of these having been {{established}} in 1876 after much lobbying from local residents. Prior to {{that there had been}} schools operating out of the Methodist, Anglican and Presbyterian churches and there had <b>even</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> public school operating briefly out of the Methodist church between 1862 and 1866 but it wasn't until 1876 that it became a permanent fixture. In 1907, two years of secondary school were added and the school became a Superior School but it wasn't until 1965 that Ashfield Boys High was formally established and separated from the primary school.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{meaningful}} {{monitoring system}} for the sector goals. The sector goals concerning access to drinking water and sanitation are not {{defined in terms of}} the definition of the UN's Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, which is considered too loose, but in terms of a more narrow definition of access. There is a large number of performance criteria, but there are no baseline data and no methodology for monitoring. There may <b>even</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> disincentive for provinces to improve their monitoring systems, since it is in their interest to show that their access figures are low and that they are in need of more central funds.|$|E
25|$|Each field {{artillery}} regiment was originally organised as two batteries, each of two troops of six guns. This was changed late in 1940 to three batteries each of eight guns. Perhaps {{the most important}} element of a battery was the Forward Observation Officer (FOO), who directed fire. Unlike most armies of the period, in which artillery observers could only request fire support, a British Army FOO (who was supposedly a Captain but could <b>even</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> subaltern) could demand it, not merely from his own battery, but from the full regiment, or even the entire {{field artillery}} of a division if required. The artillery's organisation became very flexible and effective at rapidly providing and switching fire.|$|E

25|$|Not {{only are}} {{songbird}} and human language parallel regarding neural and molecular factors, {{they also are}} similar in how their communication is initially produced. Observations about these similarities {{can be traced back}} to Charles Darwin and his studies. Avian and mammalian brains are similar in form and connectivity and there may <b>even</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> gene that is relevant to speech found in both organisms. The learning of a song is produced through a mix of interaction, experience, and predisposition. Young songbirds will imitate their species' call when presented with songs from their own and another species. They are physically capable of producing either song, but do not. Humans learn language through similar means, which is why this early vocalization in songbirds is considered babbling.|$|E
25|$|The {{dividend}} is {{hopefully the}} payout that the assignee issues, once all creditors' claims have been vetted {{and all the}} assets have been sold. The assignee hopes to generate enough cash to provide a one for one redemption of a creditor's claims. This is the hope the reality varies vastly, depending on the price the assets fetched when sold. Most dividends are {{in the form of}} cash back to the creditor, but not necessarily all. There may not <b>even</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> dividend in certain instance, thus no creditor receives any payment. There is no way to determine the cash value of an asset in the assignment process, regardless of past estimates. Tangible assets cash value can usually, but not always, be reasonably estimated. Intangible assets such as intellectual property or processes are much more difficult to evaluate.|$|E
25|$|The British {{operated}} a small fort {{on the island}} around 1794 {{in defense of the}} mouth of the Maumee River, but the fort was soon abandoned. There are conflicting accounts as to who maintained control of the island during this time. Local folklore alludes to the belief that the Indians controlled the island and used it as a military fort, while others claim the British held control of it until losing it during the War of 1812. Official accounts of the history of Turtle Island date back to 1827, when the island itself was sold at a federal government auction in nearby Monroe, Michigan. Turtle Island was believed to not <b>even</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> true island on its own but rather a former extension of Little Cedar Point Peninsula. The island was bought but sold back to the United States four years later.|$|E

25|$|As {{the souls}} that Sam {{is sent to}} {{apprehend}} have already died once (along {{with the fact that}} they have various paranormal abilities), an attempt to capture or even kill them by a mere mortal could prove almost impossible. The Devil provides Sam with vessels to help him do his work. The vessel is usually sent for Sam to open in a wooden box which varies in shape per episode, sometimes inappropriate for the vessel they hold (i.e. a large box contained a Zippo lighter vessel) and it's usually up to Sam to figure out how to use it to capture the escaped soul assigned for him to apprehend since the vessels don't usually come with an instruction manual. All vessels are unique because each of them is intended to capture the escaped soul for whom they were created and intended to confine. The vessel could <b>even</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> seemingly living thing (e.g. a live dove).|$|E
25|$|Sea {{levels were}} high during the Cretaceous period, causing marine transgressions {{in many parts}} of the world, and a great inland seaway in what is now North America. Mosasaur fossils have been found in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Portugal, Sweden, Spain, France, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, the United Kingdom, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Japan, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Niger, Angola, Morocco, Australia, New Zealand, and on Vega Island off the coast of Antarctica. Tooth taxon Globidens timorensis is known from the island of Timor; however, the phylogenetic {{placement}} of this species is uncertain and it might not <b>even</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> mosasaur. Mosasaurs have been found in Canada in Manitoba and Saskatchewan and in much of the contiguous United States. Complete or partial specimens have been found in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Georgia, as well as in states covered by the Cretaceous seaway: Texas, southwest Arkansas, New Mexico, Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota, Montana, and the Pierre Shale/Fox Hills formations of North Dakota. Lastly, mosasaur bones and teeth are also known from California, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Peru, and Chile.|$|E
25|$|Instead of worshipping every animal of a {{particular}} species, a few animal cults would select one specific animal, chosen because of its special markings, to be the totem of the particular god. Each sacred animal was pampered and cared for until its death, when elaborate burial proceedings took place. The animal was then mummified {{as a sign of}} respect to the god. Next, a new symbolic animal was chosen. Only one animal at a time would be chosen as the sacred one. These animal cults reached the pinnacle of popularity during the Late and Graeco-Roman Periods. The cycle of selecting a new totem animal continued for hundreds of years. Though the animals were undoubtedly considered sacred, Egyptians did not worship the individual animals themselves, but rather the invisible deity believed to be present within the animal symbolizing the deity. In certain cases, such as the Apis bull, the animal could <b>even</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> way to communicate the desires of the god. The Apis bull cult was the main source of this type of religious animal mummy in ancient Egypt, as most other animals were mummified in large quantities for religious offerings.|$|E

25|$|Surfing, {{like all}} water sports, carries the {{inherent}} danger of drowning. Anyone {{at any age}} can learn to surf, but {{should have at least}} intermediate swimming skills. Although the board assists a surfer in staying buoyant, it can become separated from the user. A leash, attached to the ankle or knee, can keep a board from being swept away, but does not keep a rider on the board or above water. In some cases, possibly including the drowning of professional surfer Mark Foo, a leash can <b>even</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cause of drowning by snagging on a reef or other object and holding the surfer underwater. By keeping the surfboard close to the surfer during a wipeout, a leash also increases the chances that the board may strike the rider, which could knock him or her unconscious and lead to drowning. A fallen rider's board can become trapped in larger waves, and if the rider is attached by a leash, he or she can be dragged for long distances underwater. Surfers should be careful to remain in smaller surf until they have acquired the advanced skills and experience necessary to handle bigger waves and more challenging conditions. However, even world-class surfers have drowned in extremely challenging conditions.|$|E
500|$|Sycorax also {{draws on}} {{contemporary}} beliefs regarding witches. For example, she may embody {{the belief that}} all witches have blue eyes. The character may <b>even</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> reference to a specific historical personage. [...] According to Romantic literary critic Charles Lamb, a witch, whose name has been lost to history, had recently been banished from North Africa about half a century before the time Shakespeare was writing the play; her similarity to Sycorax has struck a few scholars as notable. Lamb's claims, however, remain unverified.|$|E
500|$|Tool use by animals may {{indicate}} {{different levels of}} learning and cognition. The sea otter uses rocks as essential and regular parts of its foraging behaviour (smashing abalone from rocks or breaking open shells), with some populations spending 21% of their time making tools. Other tool use, such as chimpanzees using twigs to [...] "fish" [...] for termites, may be developed by watching others use tools and may <b>even</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> true example of animal teaching. Tools may even be used in solving puzzles in which the animal appears to experience a [...] "Eureka moment". Other mammals that do not use tools, such as dogs, can also experience a Eureka moment.|$|E
