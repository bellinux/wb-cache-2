Trança Criança foi a coleção de Geografia mais bem avaliada pelo MEC no PNLD 2004. O objeto selecionado permitiu examinar práticas e representações de atores da cadeia do livro didático: MEC e avaliadores; indústria {{editorial}} (autores, editores e técnicos de editoração); e, por fim, professora e alunos de uma sala de aula. O estudo aborda a materialidade do livro e a descrição enunciada de conteúdo (geográfico e pedagógico), e observa seu uso com princípios de orientação etnográfica. Verificou-se que o livro foi pouco usado e de modo diferente do enunciado pelos protocolos de leitura; a disciplina Geografia desenvolvida na sala de aula também se distanciou do conteúdo do livro. Tal fato revela que as práticas pedagógicas inserem-se numa dinâmica interna própria e se relacionam àquilo que se denomina cultura escolar (Chervel). Isso pode contribuir para elucidar a distância entre o que se pretende no discurso oficial e o que sucede no âmbito escolar; entre o que preconiza a ciência de referência e o que ocorre na prática geográfica escolar; entre o que traz o protocolo de leitura do livro e o uso que se faz dele. A pesquisa revelou também problemas na escolha do livro naquela realidade escolar, mas que podem se repetir no país em outros contextos e situações: os professores que estavam lecionando para a 4 ª série na ocasião da pesquisa não haviam participado da escolha do livro no PNLD 2004. No PNLD 2007, eles atuaram efetivamente e fizeram a seleção, embora não se saiba se os que escolheram os livros são os mesmos que os usariam na sala de aula, porque pode haver mudança de professores nas escolas de ano para ano. O Guia de Livros Didáticos foi pouco manuseado pelos professores, que consideraram sua linguagem de difícil leitura e excessivo o número de páginas para cada disciplina. Os professores entrevistados relataram que preferem verificar os livros, folhear suas páginas para poder escolher, em vez de se basear apenas na consulta ao Guia. O estudo de caso apresentado revela que muito ainda está por construir na política de livros didáticos, que precisa ser dialógica com as escolas, em virtude da dinâmica interna, rotina, dificuldades e cultura própria dessas instituições. The assignment {{analyzes the}} route {{established by the}} <b>didactic</b> <b>geography</b> textbook Trança Criança, 4 th grade volume. It traces the basic route from the guidelines and evaluation of MEC, {{in the context of}} the National Didactic Textbook Program (PNLD), up to the moment of use in a determined classroom. Trança Criança was considered the best collection of Geography textbooks as evaluated by MEC at PNLD 2004. The selected object allowed for the examination of practices and representations of actors from the textbook: MEC and evaluators; publishing industry (authors, editors and publishing technicians); and, finally, teachers and students in the classroom. The study dealt with the books material and a description of the stated content (geography and pedagogy), and observed their use with the principles of ethnography. The book was used very little and in a way contrary to that stated in literary protocols; the geography course developed in the classroom was also different than the content in the book. That fact reveals that the pedagogical practices are inserted with their own internal dynamics and relate to that which is called school culture (Chervel). This could help explain the distance between that intended in the official curriculum and that which succeeds in the educational environment; between that which proclaims the science of reference and that which occurs in real school geography practices; between that which brings the books reading protocol and its use. This research also reveals problems in choosing the book within that schools reality, but might be able to repeat itself around the country in other contexts and situations: the teachers that were teaching to the 4 th grade during this research had not participated in choosing the book at PNLD 2004. At PNLD 2007, they effectively took part and made the selection, even though they didnt know if the ones that chose the books were the same ones that used them in the classroom, because the teachers could have changed from year to year. The Textbook Guide was handled very little by the teachers. They considered it difficult reading and excessive in the number of pages for each course. The teachers that were interviewed reported that they prefer to verify the books, leafing through the pages in order to make a choice, instead of just basing their decision on the Guide. The study of the case presented reveals that there is still a lot to do when it comes to textbook policies. There needs to be dialogue with the schools in virtue of the internal dynamics, routines, difficulties and their own separate cultures...|$|E

In the theoretical part, a selected model that the author uses to describe the term ‘cooperation’ will be presented, the elements of which must be fulfilled to form an effective cooperation. Then, this model is transformed to the hedgerow project. The project itself consisted of four steps. First, the participating students of <b>geography</b> <b>didactics</b> are informed about hedgerows in a very interactive way. Hedgerows are a refuge for native wild flora and fauna. They were typical cultural elements of this region but have largely disappeared. After acquiring this information, each university student group prepared one lesson for each school class level during a didactic lecture at university next. With regard to sustainable working and teaching, the students held their prepared lessons in different primary school classes. Finally, the pupils built their own hedgerow in nature.

40|$|Geographical {{knowledge}} has a didactic heritage which is particularly stiff and mnemonic and has prevented geography from approaching special <b>didactics.</b> New <b>geographies</b> {{look for a}} new disciplinary approach by which the teacher uses creativity and keeps up with the different learning paces, encouraging discovery, cooperation, initiative and openness towards other people and other places. Finally, a didactics that emphasises the emotional dimension of intelligence, stimulating curiosity, interest, enthusiasm and motivation. Integration and inclusion imply extreme stances in organizing didactics and methods so that the categories {{of time and space}} are shaped according to the “Special Educational Need”. Each problem requires focused didactic, pedagogical and methodological solutions, in terms of personalised plans and adjustments in didactic strategies and methods. The idea is of a special <b>didactics</b> of <b>geography</b> that may provide not only technicality but an authentic training: it is fundamental to regularly implement a methodological approach which makes it possible to tackle tools, languages, knowledge of disciplines and general learning, in an inclusive viewpoint.

40|$|<b>Geography</b> <b>didactics</b> and {{teaching}} practice {{education at the}} Universidad Nacional del Sur is conceived as a complex unfinished process of personal construction of knowledge, in which reflective analysis is its structuring action. The <b>Geography</b> <b>didactics</b> {{and teaching}} practice class is presented as knowledge to be constructed, which allows for the relation between Geography as an academic science and Geography as a discipline within compulsory secondary school education, though the connection of the different components which are at play in the teaching-and-learning process and epistemological support, a key nexus in the process. One of the teaching aims of the class is to promote – through concrete actions – a process which favors the positioning of the teacher-to-be as “author and protagonist” of the teaching of Geography, and not merely as the applier or receiver of action designs and guidelines devised by other actors, {{many of whom are}} foreign to the classroom. In connection with this objective, the importance of designing Geography contents for secondary school education is deal with by means of different didactic proposals, ranging from theoretical foundation treatment to practice.

40|$|Taking into current {{literature}} of <b>didactics</b> of <b>Geography,</b> {{there is a}} lack of clear and coherent criteria concerning teaching-related experiments. Up to now there is a wide range of different criteria to refer to so that in concrete teaching situations the teachers’ own perception of how experiments should be used plays an important role. Against this background this paper firstly is meant to develop a workable definition of using experiments in Geography. Secondly this paper aims at analyzing and evaluating the results of six guided and standardized interviews with teachers on the subject of “Experiments in Geography lessons” based on the model of Didactical Reconstruction. These findings show that teachers are able to name main criteria for experiments, however the meaning of a control approach often seems to be unclear. Furthermore, the teachers‘ goal to achieve more precise clarity by using experiments partly correlates with the undifferentiated equating of experiments and models...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we tried to find answers to the {{following}} question: What {{is the effect of}} cognitive organisers (schemes, graphical organisers, quintets) on developing capacities characteristic of critical thinking? The hypothesis we wanted to test was the following: restructuring information through cognitive organisers did not suppose compulsory critical thinking, but restructuring while observing certain explicit tasks. We tested the hypothesis during a seminar of the <b>Didactics</b> of <b>Geography</b> in 2008. The sample was represented by 64 students in the second year at the Faculty of Geography. The task was to realise a poster about a country. That poster should have included a quintet, ten keywords, a graphical organiser, a sigle, a schematic map, and the essential ideas about the respective country. After analysing students’ results we noticed the following: restructuring information in quintets, realising the sigle and identifying ten keywords about a country required and proved use of critical thinking as a result of observing explicit or implicit tasks; when restructuring information into graphical organisers and into lists of ideas, students used certain capacities characteristic of critical thinking, but they did not assess all ideas according to the same criteria and, therefore, restructuring that information should be realised on the basis of observing certain explicit tasks...|$|R

It is a five-year course that qualifies you for teaching in both cases and it is subdivided in three main steps: traditional disciplinary courses, laboratories connected to their corresponding courses (for instance, the course of <b>Geography</b> <b>didactics</b> includes the corresponding laboratory), and training activities. These latter ones are subdivided as well in indirect training that is coordinated by the supervisors of the internship and direct training, which is carried out within schools. The teaching of Geography, {{even if it is}} underestimated in terms of hours of class as compared to other disciplinary fields, turns out to be essential, since spatial and geographical education is part of the obligatory educational offer for education in pre-school and in primary school...|$|R

Selected example of spreading urbanization {{and changing the}} Municipality of Ljubljana has been presented as a time animation since such representation best shows the geographical process. We know from textbooks and lessons what form of expansion Ljubljana had and still has and what were the historical divides that led to such expansion. The presented multimedia display shows spatial dimension of the geographical process. Display was presented before audience during geography lessons in several different ways. They showed multiple possibilities of spatial data processing and which ways are best suited for illuminating certain geographic phenomena and processes.

Pupils, students and their teachers presented their views on such a lesson and multimedia cartographic display through the survey questionnaire. From their responses we can conclude that our displays provide enough information for good spatial representation of certain geographical process and are as such appropriate teaching aid for teaching geography. This master's thesis beside making multimedia display, presenting and analysing it with help of users, also offers a detailed theoretical description of multimedia cartography with a view to the future.

40|$|Nesta investigação, tivemos como problema central a análise sobre a consciência e a mediação no ato didático dos {{professor}}es de Geografia de sete escolas nos municípios de São Gonçalo-RJ, Itaboraí-RJ e São Paulo-SP. Partimos do pressuposto que a consciência é o ato primitivo do ser humano em agir sobre sua necessidade. Desta maneira, a necessidade do professor seria mediar os conhecimentos no caso da pesquisa os geográficos. Assim, a mediação seria o processo de conhecimento significativo que se caracteriza em transmitir para o outro, o próprio conhecimento e as experiências para uma aprendizagem significativa. Entender como os professores organizam as suas ações em sala de aula, é uma forma de refletir sobre as concepções didático-pedagógicas e geográficas contemporâneas. A partir da percepção sobre a consciência e a mediação, pudemos pensar sobre quem são eles, como são as escolas, os alunos e as possíveis ações intencionais nas práticas educativas cotidianas, na elaboração do processo de ensino e de aprendizagem em Geografia. Para tanto, como fundamentos metodológicos utilizamos a etnografia escolar, que tem como objetivo a interpretação de como compreender o mundo do outro ou de aprender como as pessoas agem sobre algo, sobre as necessidades, sobre as pessoas. Neste caso, buscamos entender como agem os professores em seu território vivido a sala de aula e as interações com os alunos e o saber, decorrente do trabalho de ensinar. Desta maneira, utilizamos como instrumento de pesquisa às observações das aulas, pois vivenciamos e analisamos as diferentes formas de interpretação dos professores sobre o ensinar Geografia. Além disso, buscamos nas análises das respostas dos questionários e entrevistas, organizar as principais concepções dos professores a respeito dos seus trabalhos, para entender como são concebidas à consciência e à mediação a partir das ações didáticas no ato de ensinar. Concepções essas, vinculadas ao papel da Geografia Escolar, às abordagens pedagógicas, à relação aos meios de ensino, às atividades de aprendizagem, a territorialidade, aos conhecimentos dos professores em relação à Geografia e à Didática. Desta maneira, notamos ao final da pesquisa, depois dessas análises que os professores têm consciência sobre seu ato de trabalho em determinados momentos; e em outros, percebemos a dificuldade de pensar sobre as suas aulas, principalmente em relação aos conhecimentos que ajudam a refletir sobre o processo de mediação do conhecimento geográfico. In this research, we had {{as central}} problem, the {{analysis on the}} consciousness and the mediation in the <b>didactic</b> act of <b>geography</b> teachers from seven schools in the municipalities of São Gonçalo-RJ, Itaboraí- RJ and São Paulo-SP. On the assumption that consciousness is the primitive act of humans to act on their needs. In this way, the teachers` need would be to mediate knowledge {{in the case of}} research the geographical coverage. Then, the mediation would be the significant process of knowledge characterized in transmitting for the other one, his/her knowledge and experiences to a significant learning. Understanding how the teachers organize their didactic actions is a way to reflect on the didactic and pedagogical conceptions and contemporary geography. From the perception about consciousness and mediation, we could think of who are these teachers, as are schools, students and the intentional action of everyday educational practices in the elaboration of the process of teaching and learning Geography. For this study, we work with ethnographic methodology as methodological basis that enable us to understand other peoples world or to figure out how people act on something, about their needs and another people. We research on how teachers act in their own work places the classroom, as well as, the interaction with students and knowledge. In this way, we use the observation of teachers´ classes as an instrument, in order to analyze the different ways teachers interpreted their act of teaching Geography. Besides that, we analyze the questionnaires` answers and interviews to organize the main conceptions of teachers about their own word, and so, to understand how the consciouness and mediation are conceived, from their didactic acts. These conceptions are linked to the role of School Geography; the teaching; the relationship to the means of education and learning activies; the territorial theme and teachers´ knowledge in the relation to <b>Geography</b> and <b>Didactic.</b> Thus, in the end of this research, we notice, after these analysis, that teachers present consciousness about their work in some moments, but in other ones, we perceive some difficulties in thinking about their classes, principally in relation to knowledge important to help them how to reflect upon the mediation process of geographical knowledge...|$|R
40|$|A dificuldade havida no processo de ensino-aprendizagem da Cartografia já é um fato comprovado mediante os vários trabalhos desenvolvidos na área. Porém notamos que, em face dessas dificuldades, havia um ponto que se destacava: a influência da Matemática no aprendizado de alguns conteúdos primordiais da Cartografia (fuso horário, coordenadas geográficas e escala). Entender como, de fato, essa influência ocorria foi o princípio norteador da pesquisa. Muitos questionamentos rondam esse problema. Por que os alunos — tanto da Educação Básica quanto do Ensino Superior — demonstram tanta dificuldade na aprendizagem desses conteúdos próprios da Cartografia presentes na Geografia? Em que momento do processo de ensino esse problema sucede? O que ocorre no ensino da Matemática que leva os alunos a adquirirem certa aversão a tal área do conhecimento? Por que os professores da Educação Básica enfrentam dificuldades em ensinar tais conteúdos? A forma como esses conteúdos têm sido ministrados é um fator {{relevante}} na gênese do problema? Existem métodos que possam minimizar a dificuldade enfrentada por professores e alunos? Para que esses questionamentos fossem respondidos, propusemos como objetivo geral a investigação das causas das dificuldades de ensino-aprendizagem dos conteúdos de Cartografia, ligados à Matemática (escala, fuso horário e coordenadas geográficas), no 6 º ano do Ensino Fundamental. E definimos os seguintes objetivos específicos: identificar as principais dificuldades enfrentadas pelos professores de Geografia de escolas públicas do 6 º ano, da rede pública de Anápolis (GO), em ensinar os conteúdos de Cartografia com base matemática; verificar as causas da deficiente aprendizagem desses conteúdos pelos alunos do 6 º ano das escolas públicas de Anápolis; diagnosticar e avaliar os conteúdos de Cartografia presentes nos livros didáticos de Geografia adotados pelas unidades escolares participantes da pesquisa e apresentar proposta de ações para minorar os problemas que acarretam a deficiência na aprendizagem dos conteúdos de Cartografia com bases matemáticas. A fim de que fossem cumpridos todos os objetivos propostos, utilizamos das seguintes metodologias: levantamento bibliográfico, entrevistas, aplicação de questionários, observação sistemática de aulas, análise de livros didáticos e aplicação de um curso. Conclui-se que, com efeito, há uma dificuldade no ensino-aprendizagem dos conteúdos cartográficos ligados à Matemática e que ela está ligada não somente ao despreparo dos professores de Geografia quanto à Cartografia e à Matemática, mas também à falta de base dos alunos em relação à Matemática, o que está associado ao trabalho desenvolvido em sala de aula nos anos anteriores e que acaba refletindo na Cartografia. Por fim, cumprimos o intuito do trabalho: inquirirem-se as reais causas do problema, abrindo caminhos para métodos que possam abrandá-lo, como a aplicação de cursos aos professores como forma de aprimoramento profissional. The difficulty on teaching-learning of Cartography {{is already}} a proven fact, by the multiples scientific works developed in the area. However we noticed that face of these difficulties, there was a featured point: The math’s influence on learning of some primordial contents of Cartography (World-Time, Geographic Coordinates and Scale). Understanding how actually this influence occurred was the guiding principle of the search. Lots of inquiries surround this problem. Why the students - as much of Basic Education as Superior - show so much difficulty on learning these contents of own Cartography which are present on Geography? In which time {{of the process of}} learning this problem occurs? What occurs on math teaching that make the students to acquire a certain aversion for this area of knowledge? Why the teachers of Basic Education face difficulties to teach that contents? Is the way those contents have been given a significant factor in the genesis of the problem? Are there methods that can minimize this difficulty faced by Teachers and Students? To answer these questions we proposed as general objective the investigation of the causes of the difficulties of teaching-learning of the contents of Cartography, linked to Math (Scale, World-Time and Geographic Coordinates) in the 6 º year of Basic Education. And we define the following specific objectives: Identify the main difficulties faced by the teachers of Geography from Public Schools of the 6 º year of Basic Education in Anápolis (GO) on teaching the contents of Cartography with Math basis; verify the causes of the limited learning of these contents by the students of 6 º year of Basic Education from Public Schools of Anápolis (GO); to diagnose e evaluate the present contents of Cartography in the <b>didactic</b> books of <b>Geography</b> adopted by the scholar unities that were part of the search and show action proposes to alleviate the problems that generate the limitation on learning the contents of Cartography with Math basis. To meet all the proposed objectives, we used the following methodologies: bibliographic searching, interviews, application of questionnaires, systematic observation of classes, analysis of didactic books and application of a course. We concluded that there is in fact a difficulty on teaching-learning of the cartographic contents linked to Math and this difficulty is linked not only to the unpreparedness of teachers of Geography with Cartography and Mathematics contents but also in the limited basis of the students related to Math which is associated to work developed in classroom in past years that reflect on Cartography. Lastly we accomplished the aim of the work: inquires to the real causes of the problem, opening the ways for methods that can alleviate them, like the application of courses to the teachers like a way of professional improvement...|$|R
40|$|Esta dissertação, intitulada O conceito de lugar no livro didático e o processo de ensino-aprendizagem, está pautada na problemática do uso do livro didático nas aulas de Geografia, a sua sutil contribuição para a formação cidadã do aluno e efetiva aprendizagem do conhecimento geográfico. A pesquisa pretendeu {{responder}} às seguintes questões: quais têm sido as concepções de lugar trazidas pelas obras didáticas de cunho regional utilizadas em Goiás nos anos iniciais? Como os professores se apropriam dos conceitos de lugar apontados por essas obras e os utilizam durante o processo de ensino-aprendizagem? A partir do exposto, a pesquisa teve por objetivos: analisar as práticas e concepções teóricas trazidas e propiciadas por livros didáticos de Geografia de cunho regional de Goiás, e a introdução desses apontamentos em sala de aula nas turmas de Ensino Fundamental I acerca do conceito de lugar; problematizar a Geografia trazida pelos livros didáticos de Geografia; discutir as diferentes bases para a construção do conceito de lugar na Geografia acadêmica e na Geografia escolar; interpretar e analisar a prática de quem atua diretamente com o processo formativo nos anos iniciais – o professor. No âmbito da Geografia escolar, em especial dos anos iniciais, o conceito de lugar é entendido como um potencializador do processo de ensino-aprendizagem, daí a importância em compreender de que maneira este conceito é apresentado nos livros utilizados em sala de aula. Para o desenvolvimento do trabalho, recorreu-se à abordagem qualitativa pautada especialmente pela dialética. A coleta de dados da pesquisa se deu por meio de investigação documental no livro didático 32140 L 1629 aprovado pelo Programa Nacional do Livro Didático (PNLD) – 2010 e 2013, Edital PNLD e Guia do Livro Didático. Buscou-se durante a pesquisa a análise de conteúdo que faziam parte da obra pesquisada, pondo-o à luz da teoria da aprendizagem histórico-social e do conhecimento acadêmico construído acerca da Geografia Escolar. Outro procedimento metodológico foi entrevista realizada com uma professora dos anos iniciais. Tem-se, nessa dissertação, a visão do pesquisador e da professora sobre o livro didático em constante diálogo com pensadores das áreas mencionadas. Segundo o que foi pesquisado, correlacionar diferentes posicionamentos teóricos sobre o lugar propicia ao aluno o aprendizado mais condizente com sua realidade e possibilita o avanço para realidades que não lhe sejam imediatamente mais próximas. Para que essa abordagem ocorra o professor precisa se entender como sujeito de sua prática e como mediador no processo de construção do conhecimento. Dessa maneira, não pode relegar essa função a um material que lhe é apenas um apoio. This dissertation, entitled The {{concept of}} Place in the didactic {{book and the}} teachinglearning process, {{is focused on the}} matter of the not so discerning use of the didactic book in the geography classes, its subtle contribution to the citizen formation of the students and the effective learning of the geographic knowledge. The research had the intention to answer the following questions: what have been the conceptions of place brought by the didactic works of regional nature used in the state of Goiás during the early years? How do the teachers absorb the concepts of place pointed by those works and how do they use these concepts during the teaching-learning process? From what has been exposed, the research had as aims: to analyze the practices and the theoretical conceptions brought and propitiated by the <b>didactic</b> books of <b>Geography</b> that have regional characteristics of the state of Goiás and the introduction of these notes in the classrooms of Elementary school concerning the meaning of place; problematize the Geography that is brought by the didactic books, discuss the different basis to the construction of the concept of place in the academic Geography and in the school Geography; to interpret and to analyze the practice of those who works directly with the formative process in the early years – the teacher. In the ambit of the school Geography, especially in the early years, the concept of place is understood as an engine that improves the learning-teaching process, that is why it is important to comprehend how this concept is presented in the didactic books used in the classrooms. The qualitative approach, ruled specially by the dialectic, was used to develop this work. The data collection of the research happened through the documental investigation in the didactic book 32140 L 1629 endorsed by National Didactic Book Program – 2010 and 2013, PNLD Edict and Didactic book Guide. The analysis of the content {{that was part of the}} researched works was sought during the research, in the lights of historicalsocial learning theory and the academic knowledge built about the school Geography. The interview done with an early-year teacher was another methodological procedure adopted in this research. In this dissertation, it‟s found the teacher and the researcher‟s view about the didactic book in constant dialogue with thinkers of the mentioned areas. According to what was researched, by correlating different theoretical positioning about place it is possible for the student to have an apprenticeship close to his/her reality and it also makes possible that this student gets closer to realities that are not so familiar to him/her. In order to this approach can occur, the teacher needs to understand himself/herself as the subject of his/her practice and as a mediator in the knowledge building process. This way, the teacher cannot assign this function to a material that is just a support for him/her...|$|R
