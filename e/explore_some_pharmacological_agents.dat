40|$|OBJECTIVE Delirium is a {{very common}} and serious {{disorder}} with high morbidity and mortality. Despite symptomatic treatment the outcome can be poor for some especially when no underlying cause is identified. As a result, various strategies for delirium prevention have been assessed. <b>Pharmacological</b> <b>agents</b> such as antipsychotics, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, sleep-wake cycle regulators, anti-inflammatories {{and others have been}} advocated for a potential role in delirium prevention. The aim {{of this paper is to}} review the available evidence for their use in the prevention of delirium. METHODS An electronic search was carried out using Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and other studies. The words delirium, prevention, intervention, pharmacological, prophylactic, antipsychotics, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, sleep and anti-inflammatories were used. References from selected papers were also searched. RESULTS No multi-centre RCT has been identified. Few trials and other studies have been published so far assessing the prophylactic role of antipsychotics, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, hypnotics, melatonin, and gabapentin. As these studies tested different drugs, regimes and protocols in diverse populations no meaningful comparison can be made. CONCLUSION To date there is conflicting and inconsistent data regarding the efficacy of pharmacological treatment for delirium prevention. Positive reports in few of the studies justify further assessment of the potential for <b>some</b> <b>pharmacological</b> <b>agents</b> in the prevention of delirium. Well designed and appropriately powered RCTs are now needed.

40|$|Abstract. The {{closure of}} a simple form of {{temporary}} connection of the sum-mation reflex type was studied by combining light flashes with subthreshold electrical stimulation of the cortical site of representation of the right forelimb in the cat. Summation, i. e., forepaw flexion, occurred both when two subthreshold stimuli were applied simultaneously and {{when there was a}} short (tens of milli-seconds) interval between the stimuli. The sequence of stimulus presentation (current + light or light + current) was immaterial.

Neurophysiological analysis of the electrical correlates of establishment of the simple form of temporary connection (study of neuronal activity, the effect of <b>some</b> <b>pharmacological</b> <b>agents,</b> testing by paired stimuli) suggests that the mechanism of closure under study is dependent on induction relations manifested by the enhancement of phasic changes in excitatory 2 nd inhibitory processes.

40|$|Almost all {{mammalian}} cells carry one primary cilium that {{functions as}} a biosensor for chemical and mechanical stimuli. Genetic damages that compromise cilia formation or function cause a spectrum of disorders referred to as ciliapathies. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} <b>some</b> <b>pharmacological</b> <b>agents</b> and extracellular environmental changes can alter primary cilium length. Renal injury is a well-known example of an environmental insult that triggers cilia length modification. Lithium treatment causes primary cilia to extend in several cell types including neuronal cells;this phenomenon is likely independent of glycogen synthase kinase- 3 β inhibition. In renal epithelial cell lines, deflection of the primary cilia by fluid shear shortens them by reducing the intracellular cyclic AMP level, leading to a subsequent decrease in mechanosensitivity to fluid shear. Primary cilium length is also influenced by the dynamics of actin filaments and microtubules through the levels of soluble tubulin in the cytosol available for primary cilia extension. Thus, mammalian cells can adapt to the extracellular environment by modulating the primary cilium length, and this feedback system utilizing primary cilia might exist throughout the mammalian body. Further investigation is required concerning the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the control of primary cilium length in response to environmental factors...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Primary polydipsia, or {{psychogenic}} polydipsia, is {{a condition}} that results in considerable morbidity and mortality. In psychiatric patients, psychogenic polydipsia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion may cause hyponatremia. In the 1970 s, it was recognized that antipsychotics such as tiotixene and haloperidol could impair the excretion of a free water load. There are also several case reports of drug-induced hyponatremia in patients using atypical drugs suggesting that these probably can also impair water balance and induce hyponatremia. Case report and review of relevant literature are reported in this article. Psychogenic polydipsia is a common cause of hyponatremia among individuals with chronic mental illness. A case of severe hyponatremia caused by psychogenic polydipsia is described involving a female patient with an adult lifelong history of chronic mental illness diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder. After switching her antipsychotic medication to clozapine water ingestion was normalized as well as sodium levels and her psychotic symptoms improved. Primary polydipsia occurs commonly with schizophrenia and other mental diseases and can cause hyponatremia. PPD may present as an acute psychotic state or as inexplicable emergence of seizures. Appropriate, timely clinical assessment with special attention to thirst, fluid intake, and urine output is essential. Proper treatment may include drug withdrawal and fluid and saline restriction. Once corrected, <b>some</b> <b>pharmacological</b> <b>agents</b> can be tried.

Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are conventional and well-established therapeutic options, but some clients fail to respond and the safety of using <b>some</b> <b>pharmacological</b> <b>agents</b> during pregnancy is unclear. Some neuromodulation techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), have been studied in depressed pregnant women. Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of rTMS for major depression in pregnant women. Methods: The LILACS and PubMed databases were reviewed using the search terms depression, pregnancy and magnetic stimulation. Texts including primary data, published in Portuguese, Spanish, or English, between 1995 and 2014, that evaluated depressed pregnant women and used rTMS as the intervention were selected. Papers lacking sufficient data were excluded. Twenty-two texts were initially identified; after applying the inclusion criteria, 12 were selected and analyzed. Results: The studies reviewed reported satisfactory responses to rTMS in acute depressive episodes, as measured using depressive symptom scales. Remission of symptoms was achieved in many cases. The procedure was well tolerated and there were no reports of damage/complications to unborn children. Conclusion: The data available at this time support the efficacy and tolerability of rTMS for depression in pregnant women. Controlled studies should corroborate this conclusion.

40|$|Currently, {{glaucoma}} is recognised as an optic neuropathy. Selective {{death of}} retinal ganglion cells (RGC) is {{the hallmark of}} glaucoma, which is also associated with structural changes in the optic nerve head. The process of RGC death is thought to be biphasic: a primary injury responsible for initiation of damage that is followed by a slower secondary degeneration related to noxious environment surrounding the degenerating cells. For example, retinal ishaemia may establish a cascade of changes that ultimately result in cell death: hypoxia leads to excitotoxic levels of glutamate, which cause a rise in intra-cellular calcium, which in turn, leads to neuronal death due to apoptosis or necrosis. Neuroprotection is a process that attempts to preserve the cells that were spared during the initial insult, but are still vulnerable to damage. Although not yet available, a neuroprotective agent would be of great use in arresting the progression of glaucoma. There is evidence that neuroprotection can be achieved both pharmacologically and immunologically. Pharmacological intervention aims at neutralising some {{of the effects of the}} nerve-derived toxic factors, thereby increasing the ability of the spared neurons to cope with stressful conditions. On the other hand, immunological interventions boost the body&#x 2032;s own repair mechanisms for counteracting the toxic effects of various chemicals generated during the cascade.

Acute toxicity {{studies showed that}} the crude extract had an LD 50 value of 417. 5 mg/kg. mice, i. p. Based on this value, test doses (5 - 160 mg/kg) below the LD 50 value were selected and {{used to determine the}} effects of each dose of extract on the arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate of normotensive and hypertensive rats. <b>Some</b> <b>pharmacological</b> <b>agents</b> like propranolol, noradrenaline, acetylcholine and atropine sulphate were also used to assess the mechanism of action of the extract on blood pressure. From the results, the extract produced a dose-dependent depression of blood pressure and heart rate in both normo- and hypertensive rats. At doses of 5 mg/kg and 160 mg/kg, the extracts produced about 8. 99 + 3. 2 % and 54 + 7. 4 % depression of BP respectively, in normotensive rats while the corresponding values for the hypertensives were 4. 8 + 2. 3 % and 43. 9 + 5. 5 % respectively. The duration of action of the extract was also found to be dose-dependent. Noradrenaline (1. 5 μg/kg) blocked the action of the extract. Both propranolol (1. 0 μg/kg) and atropine (1. 5 μg/kg) failed to block or abolish the action of the extract on rat BP.

Materials and Methods: In a case-control study, 50 patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with different etiologies and 50 patients with sinus rhythm and similar bases were selected. Sampling for highly sensitive c-reactive (hs-CRP) was done on the patients presenting with AF to the Ghaem hospital between October 2006 and June 2007. Results: Mean age of the patients was 62 years with maximum of 90 and minimum of 36 and standard deviation of 13. 80. The most frequent age group was 71 - 80 years. Fifty-four percent of patients were male and 46 % were female. Mean serum hs-CRP levels in AF patients with hypertension (HTN),Ischemic heart disease(IHD), Valvular heart disease (VHD), HTN+IHD and hyperthyroidism were 8. 10, 9. 40, 8. 68, 10. 16 and 5. 98 mg/Lit; respectively. There was significant difference between hs-CRP levels in hypertensive patients in the two groups (P= 0. 010). Similar results were observed in IHD patients, VHD patients and HTN+IHD patients in two groups (P= 0. 015, P= 0. 037, P= 0. 000). Conclusion: In addition to some risk factors like baseline cardiac diseases, aging, thyrotoxicosis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia and cardiac surgery, there also appears to be consistent links between hs-CRP, a marker of inflammation, and the pathogenesis of AF.

The efficacy of different kinds of products is evaluated. Short term weight loss with drug treatment seems to be generally modest while maintenance in the long term is even more disappointing. Furthermore drug treatment cannot be prescribed without an associated reduction in energy intake, increased physical activity and lifestyle changes, otherwise weight loss will not be achieved and weight regain will annihilate the treatment effects. Drugs have shown wide ranging side effects and contraindication from a prolongued use. Orlistat, which reduces the absorption of fat from the gastrointestinal tract by lipase inhibition, is the most used drug in the present day context, while sibutramine or the endocannabinoids are not more available in most countries. Newer concepts in weight management are mainly hormonal and receptor based, in the effort to reduce adverse effects.

Therefore, we {{examine the effects of}} some ischemic factors on KCa channels in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by means of the patch-clamp technique. In whole-cell recordings (test potentials: - 60 mV to± 100 mV) the perfusion with an artificial (“ischemic”) Tyrode solution (pH= 6. 8; pO 2 = 45 mmHg, glucose-free) of HUVEC caused a significant increase of an outward current in the voltage range of + 40 mV to± 100 mV (P< 0. 05; n= 15; Fig. 1 : I/V-relationship, mean values; Fig. 2 : sample of recordings). These currents were completely blOCked by extracellular tetraethylammonium (TEA: 0. 5 mM). whereas glibenclamide (10 μM) had no effect. In cell-attached patches (140 mM K+ pipette solution) KCa channels were characterized by their typical voltage dependence, their block by TEA and a single-channel slope conduction of 215 pS (± 5. 17 pS; n< 10). Superfusion of HUVEC with the artificial solution caused {{a significant increase in the}} open-state probability NPo (N: channels in the patch) of KCa channels from 0. 0141 ± 0. 0056 to 0. 0377 ± 0. 0119 at + 80 mV (p< 0. 05 : n= 6) and 0. 0645 ± 0. 0221 to 0. 1599 ± 0. 0485 at+ 100 mV (p< 0. 05; n= 7) (Fig. 3 : sample of KCa recordings).

The aim of this thesis was to assess sleep patterns in older adults, and to investigate <b>some</b> <b>pharmacological</b> <b>agents</b> taken by older adults as sleep aids. A survey of 5846 older adults identified sleep complaints and methods of alleviation. Results supported previous findings, and pain and nocturia {{were found to be}} the main reasons for nocturnal awakenings. Respondents reported the use of hypnotics, antidepressants, over-the-counter preparations and herbal remedies as sleep aids. Respondents also used whisky, hot milky drinks and reading at bedtime to aid sleep. Three placebo-controlled clinical trials were implemented to assess the effects of a herbal remedy (valerian), three hypnotics (loprazolam, zopiclone and zolpidem), and two antidepressants (dothiepin and moclobemide) on sleep and daytime performance. Results showed few advantageous effects of an acute dose of valerian. Loprazolam, zopiclone and zolpidem were given to younger adults to assess these treatments without the confounds of old age. These treatments were found to be effective hypnotics from the first night of use, but there were more residual sedative effects under loprazolam than zopiclone or zolpidem. Neither dothiepin nor moclobemide were found to be suitable for use as sleep aids, also using a younger population. Findings indicate most older adults do not have sleep complaints, but those who do are likely to have sleep problems due to physical reasons. More research is necessary into the duration of valerian use and doses for efficacy. Residual sedative effects under loprazolam may increase the risk of accidents, and shorter acting hypnotics, such as zopiclone and zolpidem, may reduce this risk. Dothiepin showed more sedative effect than moclobemide, but there was little evidence of improved sleep. Further research is necessary to establish the causes of poor sleep in old age, and to assess the suitability of other sleep aids in this age group...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} whether the new taxonomy of Malassezia may have important clinical implications. In particular, the studies look at pityriasis versicolor and other dermatological disorders associated with Malassezia yeasts to see {{whether there is a}} clear association between the yeast species and body site colonized and/or disease state. The papers in this thesis also use laboratory work to supplement these clinical investigations. One of the papers tests the in vitro efficacy of several antifungal agents (ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and terbinafine) against various strains of the seven Malassezia species. The Malassezia species are sensitive to the azoles; however, the in vitro susceptibility of different strains of Malassezia to terbinafine is varied. The second paper describes molecular techniques to distinguish between the Malassezia species. Using PCR and restriction enzyme analysis of four regions of the Malassezia genome, we were able to distinguish between the seven Malassezia species. The next two papers are concerned with the relationship between the new taxonomy of Malassezia and various dermatological disorders. The purpose of the third paper was {{to determine whether or not}} one or more of the Malassezia species were more commonly associated with pityriasis versicolor lesions than any of the other species. We also investigated possible species differences in other diseases related, or possibly related, to Malassezia species. These diseases were seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. In addition to the relationship between the species and the diseases, the relationship between body site and species was also investigated. The fifth paper in this thesis is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre, international study that investigates the potential use of itraconazole as prophylactic treatment for this condition. It was found that itraconazole is significantly more effective than placebo in both therapy of the active disease and as a prophylactic against recurring pityriasis versicolor. Overall, the studies presented in this thesis investigate the relationship between Malassezia yeasts and various dermatological disorders, primarily pityriasis versicolor. The new taxonomy of Malassezia may have clinical implications. Our work suggests that <b>some</b> <b>pharmacological</b> <b>agents</b> have varying efficacy against some strains and species of Malassezia. If it is, in fact, the case that certain species are reliably associated with particular disorders, species differences may ultimately become important in the development of new interventions against Malassezia-related disorders...|$|R

Of a number of drugs tested, six metal-binding agents including hydralazine inactivated the active principle. The material was stable in acid but not in alkali. It was destroyed by drying. Chemical analysis and inactivation procedures suggested the presence of primary amine and considerable sulfur; a peptide linkage was suspected because of inactivation by manganous ion and papain.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic {{acidosis}} and stroke-like episodes) is a mitochondrial disease most usually caused by point mutations in tRNA genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Approximately 80 % {{of cases of}} MELAS syndrome {{are associated with a}} m. 3243 A > G mutation in the MT-TL 1 gene, which encodes the mitochondrial tRNALeu (UUR). Currently, no effective treatments are available for this chronic progressive disorder. Treatment strategies in MELAS and other mitochondrial diseases consist of several drugs that diminish the deleterious effects of the abnormal respiratory chain function, reduce the presence of toxic agents or correct deficiencies in essential cofactors. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH We evaluated the effectiveness of <b>some</b> common <b>pharmacological</b> <b>agents</b> that have been utilized in the treatment of MELAS, in yeast, fibroblast and cybrid models of the disease. The yeast model harbouring the A 14 G mutation in the mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) gene, which is equivalent to the A 3243 G mutation in humans, was used in the initial screening. Next, the most effective drugs that were able to rescue the respiratory deficiency in MELAS yeast mutants were tested in fibroblasts and cybrid models of MELAS disease. KEY RESULTS According to our results, supplementation with riboflavin or coenzyme Q 10 effectively reversed the respiratory defect in MELAS yeast and improved the pathologic alterations in MELAS fibroblast and cybrid cell models. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Our results indicate that cell models have great potential for screening and validating the effects of novel drug candidates for MELAS treatment and presumably also for other diseases with mitochondrial impairment...|$|R

This {{study is}} a {{questionnaire}} survey {{on the use of}} <b>pharmacological</b> <b>agents</b> to modify liver ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in patients undergoing hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases with the target population being those units participating in the LiverMetSurvey international registry. Methods. Members of LiverMetSurvey were sent an online questionnaire using SurveyMonkey comprising ten questions on the use of <b>pharmacological</b> <b>agents</b> to modulate hepatic IR injury in the perioperative period after hepatectomy. The questionnaire was sent to 446 clinicians registered with the LiverMetSurvey. There were 83 (19 %) respondents. Results. Fifty-two (77 % of 68 respondents to this question) never used <b>pharmacological</b> <b>agents</b> to modify liver IR injury during hepatectomy. Thirteen (19 %) used <b>pharmacological</b> <b>agents</b> selectively. Three (4 %) used these routinely. N-Acetylcysteine was the most widely used <b>pharmacological</b> <b>agent</b> with equal distribution of use around intraoperative and postoperative periods. Conclusions. This {{is believed to be the}} first survey on the use of <b>pharmacological</b> <b>agents</b> to modify liver IR injury. The target population is clinicians involved in liver resection. The results show that pharmacological modulation is used by only a minority of respondents to this questionnaire and that when this treatment is selected, N-acetylcysteine is the most frequently used...|$|R
