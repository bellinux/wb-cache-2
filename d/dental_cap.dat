40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThe {{cellular}} {{distribution and}} changes of sugar residues during tooth development in embryos of the rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus were investigated by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated lectins (lectin- HRP). The lectins SBA, ECA, and LTA show no binding to any {{region of the}} <b>dental</b> <b>cap</b> and bell stages, whereas BS- 1 and UEA- 1 bind to dental cells at both stages. Appropriate control studies confirmed the specificity of the binding of the lectins. At cap stage, the lectins BS- 1 and UEA- 1 show moderate binding to the (pre) -ameloblast and (pre) -odontoblast cells. These {{results suggest that the}} acetylgalactosamine and a-L-fucose residues present in (pre) -ameloblasts and (pre) -odontoblasts, respectively, are common to determined but relatively undifferentiated cells capable of forming matrices of hard tissues. Since the odontoblast and ameloblast express dentin and enamel, respectively, it can be speculated that the abundance of these residues in these cells might be associated with the maintenance of the capacity of the cells to produce such matrices. At the bell stage, the odontoblasts display considerable amounts of a-L-fucose, whereas a-L-fucose is poorly localized in ameloblasts. However, ameloblasts contain significant quantities of N-acetylgalactosamine, whereas only a diffuse positivity for this carbohydrate is apparent in odontoblasts. The marked changes of the glycosylation pattern of these glycoconjugates might indicate that they play a role during the cell-to-cell interaction and might also be involved in the odontoblastic and ameloblastic functional activity. Such a possibility is entirely speculative until specific in vitro experiments are conducted. DTI, Universidad de Chil...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{response}} of human <b>dental</b> pulp <b>capped</b> with a mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and Ca(OH) (2) powder. Methods and Material: Pulp exposures were performed on the occlusal floor of 40 permanent premolars. The pulp was then capped with either Ca(OH) (2) powder (CH) or MTA and restored with resin composite. After 30 days (groups CH 30 and MTA 30) and 60 days (groups CH 60 and MTA 60), the teeth were extracted and processed for HE and categorized in a histological score system. The data were subjected to Kruskal-Wallis and Conover tests (alpha= 0. 05). Results: In regard to dentin bridge formation, CH 30 showed a tendency towards superior performance compared to MTA 30 (p> 0. 05), although the products showed comparable results at day 60.

Histological sections were prepared and examined for degree and type of pulp inflammation (hyperaemia, pulpitis, necrosis or gangrene). Degenerative changes of dental pulp (vacuolation, calcification, amyloid or hyaline changes) were also determined. For indirect pulp capping the width of predentine in crown and root dental pulp was measured, and for direct pulp capping and partial pulpectomy (vital pulpotomy) the width and quality of the dentinal bridge were graded. The radical method of partial vital pulpectomy of the coronal part of the dental pulp in dogs produced better quality and continuity of the dentinal bridge than the less radical method of direct pulp capping. This was particularly obvious in small single root teeth such as incisors. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Various {{materials}} {{are used in}} direct <b>dental</b> pulp <b>capping</b> method. Their biocompatibility and alkalizing abilities are of primary importance affecting therapeutic effects. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate and compare the cytotoxicity of various pulp-capping materials on human gingival fibroblasts and investigate the pH changes induced by these materials. Material and methods. Human gingival fibroblasts were cultured with nine direct pulp materials using culture plate inserts. The cytotoxic effects were recorded by using an MTT-based colorimetric assay after 3 and 24 h. In the second part of the experiment, the materials were inserted in dialysis tubes and transferred into plastic vials containing deionized water. The changes of the medium pH were measured after 3 and 24 h. Results. We showed differences in cell viability of gingival fibroblasts after varied time of exposition for the tested materials. Cell viability after 24 h increased for Dycal, Biopulp, and Calcipro, and decreased for Calcipulpe, Angelus, Angelus White, and ProRoot Regular. Cell viability for ProRoot and Life did not change. Non-setting calcium hydroxide preparations followed by the MTA group and setting calcium hydroxide materials produced the highest pH. All the tested materials significantly increased pH (p < 0. 0001) at 24 h. Conclusions. Currently used pulp capping materials varied in their cytotoxicity relative to human gingival fibroblasts and their alkalizing capacities. Since most likely pH does not affect the viability of cultured cells, further investigations are required to determine physicochemical properties of these materials and the biological activity of the dental pulp.

40|$|Calcium (Ca) is {{the main}} element of most pulp capping {{materials}} and plays {{an essential role in}} mineralization. Different pulp capping materials can release various concentrations of Ca ions leading to different clinical outcomes. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of various concentrations of Ca ions on the growth and osteogenic differentiation of human dental pulp cells (hDPCs). Different concentrations of Ca ions were added to growth culture medium and osteogenic inductive culture medium. A Cell Counting Kit- 8 (CCK- 8) was used to determine the proliferation of hDPCs in growth culture medium. Osteogenic differentiation and mineralization were measured by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay, Alizarin red S/von kossa staining, calcium content quantitative assay. The selected osteogenic differentiation markers were investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Within the range of 1. 8 – 16. 2 mM, increased concentrations of Ca ions had no effect on cell proliferation, but led to changes in osteogenic differentiation. It was noted that enhanced mineralized matrix nodule formation was found in higher Ca ions concentrations; however, ALP activity and gene expression were reduced. qRT-PCR results showed a trend towards down-regulated mRNA expression of type I collagen (COL 1 A 2) and Runx 2 at elevated concentrations of Ca ions, whereas osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OCN) mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated. Ca ions content in the culture media can significantly influence the osteogenic properties of hDPCs, indicating the importance of optimizing Ca ions release from <b>dental</b> pulp <b>capping</b> materials in order to achieve desirable clinical outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Dental caries {{is one of}} {{the most}} common chronic {{diseases}} in the world. In daily dental practice, dentists are treating many cases where the destruction from caries involves enamel and dentin and reaches the pulp. One of the main objectives of a restorative dental procedure is the protection of the pulp to maintain its vitality, and pulp capping has been shown to be very successful in this regard for cases of reversible pulpitis. When the carious lesion is in close proximity to the pulp but the pulp tissue has not been exposed, indirect pulp capping is performed using any of several liner or base materials prior to placing the final restoration. On the other hand, if there is a direct exposure to the pulp, treatment with direct pulp capping requires careful and specific selection of the pulp capping material. 	In the past decade, there has been a debate on the best available material to be used in direct pulp capping. Calcium hydroxide was considered the gold standard material used for direct pulp capping for decades prior to the introduction of Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA). Many studies have been conducted to study the effectiveness of these materials when used in direct pulp capping. The purpose of this study is to identify the best available evidence on direct pulp capping material and determine if MTA is more effective than calcium hydroxide. Methods:The research strategy included search engines and hand searching to obtain randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews relevant to the research question. The search engines used were PubMed, ADA Evidence Base Database, Cochrane library and Web of science. Two readers were involved in validating the quality of the evidence and strength of recommendation in randomized clinical trials using Ex-GRADE and the revised risk of bias instruments. Acceptable sampling will be completed prior to performing Meta-analysis. Similarly, (R-AMSTAR) instrument was used to quantify the quality of systematic reviews. Results:The bibliome consists of seven clinical trials, five observational studies and four systematic reviews. The acceptable sampling analysis produced three systematic reviews, two clinical trials and four observational studies. Qualitative assessment of the accepted studies confirmed that MTA is more effective and shows better clinical outcomes in direct pulp capping procedure when compared to calcium hydroxide. Conclusion:This review confirms that direct pulp capping is an effective conservative approach to maintain the vitality of dental pulp tissue. Qualitative consensus of the research confirmed that MTA showed a higher success rate, reduced pulpal inflammation, and had a more reparative dentin formation when used for direct pulp capping. Calcium hydroxide showed more failures compared to MTA, and the superiority of MTA was confirmed in short and long periods of follow up.

40|$|Pulp repair is {{a complex}} process whose {{mechanisms}} are not yet fully understood. The first immune cells to reach the damaged pulp are neutrophils that {{play an important role}} in releasing cytokines and in phagocytosis. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of different pulp-capping materials on the secretion of interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 &# 946;) and interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) by migrating human neutrophils. Neutrophils were obtained from the blood of three healthy donors. The experimental groups were calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH) 2], an adhesive system (Single Bond), and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). Untreated cells were used as control. Transwell chambers were used in performing the assays to mimic an in vivo situation of neutrophil chemotaxis. The pulp-capping materials were placed in the lower chamber and the human neutrophils, in the upper chamber. The cells were counted and the culture medium was assayed using ELISA kits for detecting and quantifying IL- 1 &# 946; and IL 8. The data were compared by ANOVA followed by Tukey's test (p < 0. 05). The secretion of IL- 8 was significantly higher in all groups in comparison to the control group (p < 0. 05). The adhesive system group showed higher IL- 8 than the MTA group (p < 0. 05). The secretion of IL- 1 &# 946; was significantly greater only in the MTA group (p < 0. 001). It was concluded that only MTA is able to improve the secretion of IL- 1 &# 946;, and all materials tested increased IL- 8 secretion.

40|$|Different {{materials}} {{have been used}} for vital dental pulp treatment. Preferably a pulp capping agent should show appropriate biological performance, excellent handling properties, and a good imaging contrast. These features can be delivered into a single material through the combination of therapeutic and diagnostic agents (i. e. theranostic). Calcium phosphate based composites (CPCs) are potentially ideal candidate for pulp treatment, although poor imaging contrast and poor dentino-inductive properties are limiting their clinical use. In this study, a theranostic <b>dental</b> pulp <b>capping</b> agent was developed. First, imaging properties of the CPC were improved by using a core-shell structured dual contrast agent (csDCA) consisting of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) and colloidal gold, as MRI and CT contrast agent respectively. Second, biological properties were implemented by using a dentinogenic factor (i. e. bone morphogenetic protein 2, BMP- 2). The obtained CPC/csDCA/BMP- 2 composite was tested in vivo, as direct pulp capping agent, in a male Habsi goat incisor model. Our outcomes showed no relevant alteration of the handling and mechanical properties (e. g. setting time, injectability, and compressive strength) by the incorporation of csDCA particles. In vivo results proved MRI contrast enhancement up to 7 weeks. Incisors treated with BMP- 2 showed improved tertiary dentin deposition as well as faster cement degradation as measured by microCT assessment. In conclusion, the presented theranostic agent matches the imaging and regenerative requirements for pulp capping applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we combined diagnostic and therapeutic agents in order to developed a theranostic pulp capping agent with enhanced MRI and CT contrast and improved dentin regeneration ability. In our study we cover all the steps from material preparation, mechanical and in vitro characterization, to in vivo study in a goat dental model.
