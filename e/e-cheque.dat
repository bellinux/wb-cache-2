40|$|With the {{introduction}} of Check 21 law {{and the development of}} FSTC's echeck system, there has been an increasing usage of <b>e-cheque</b> conversions and acceptance among retailers, banks, and consumers. However, the current <b>e-cheque</b> system does not address issues concerning privacy, confidentiality, and traceability. We highlight the issues concerning the current electronic cheque system and provide a solution to overcome those drawbacks. 5 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Payment {{is one of}} {{the main}} parts in businesses. Different types of software, {{hardware}} and methods for paying electronically have been presented. Different types of banking cards, E-wallet, internet web pages for payment make it possible to pay both online and offline. However, in most payment tools, exchanging money is anonymously and untraceably. Therefore, although most security techniques within payment tools are considered to restrict abuse, if it is stolen, it makes possible to be abuse. Furthermore, anonymous characteristics of E-money make it possible for money laundering. <b>E-cheque</b> includes both sides name in a business, and also it is traceable. By using <b>E-cheque</b> techniques in payment tools instead of E-money, it is possible to increase payment tools security...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In banks, as part {{of normal}} procedure, {{receipts}} for deposits, statements of the bank account or credit card account are regularly issued to customers. This whole procedure is time consuming. Also, officials often {{find it difficult to}} sign for all the documents required by a customer though the related sub-processes are completed and corresponding documents are digitally signed. We consider the scenario of e-receipt generation during <b>e-cheque</b> processing, where the subprocess like <b>e-cheque</b> verification and receiving acknowledgement from cheque clearing bank are completed and digitally signed. But there is need for e-receipt to be generated by the bank for the customer. When the number of e-cheques increase, it is a burden for the bank to issue e-receipts. In this scenarios, we observe that, it would be interesting if customers themselves are capable of generating signed receipts based on the signatures available on already completed transactions. This calls for signature of a document to be derived from existing signatures of related documents. By this a customer can derive signatures on his own without the intervention of the bank which inturn reduces the work load on the bank. In all the signature derivations we make, we take care that a new signature derived is similar to the one that the signer would have generated if he had signed himself and also all signatures either existing or derived are verified using the same verification equation.

5000|$|On 25 August 2009, {{the third}} {{marathon}} run was announced, set {{to start on}} 20 November 2009. At 18:42 GMT-0 on 26 November 2009 the marathon completed, raising over $140,000 (after all <b>e-cheques</b> had cleared) for Child's Play. One notable donor, going by the alias [...] "Octopimp", donated nearly $10,000 alone, becoming a mascot of sorts in the event's live chatroom and in turn inspiring many other high-number donations and auction bids.|$|R

40|$|The {{technologies}} for e-commerce comprise of all components required for transacting businesses in electronic (digital) domain. The various components or subsystems {{making up the}} e-commerce super system include Digital Payment Systems, Payment server, Payment Gateway, Wallet, and security systems like Firewall and Intrusion Detection. Digital Payment Systems include payment instruments like <b>e-cheque,</b> and credit cards. E-Wallet is used to hold different payment instruments. Payment Server and Payment Gateways help to realize the end-to-end payment in the electronic domain. Public Key Infrastructure is the necessary infrastructure required for effective operation of ecommerce in real life applications. In this paper, we present {{a brief description of}} the aforementioned {{technologies for}} e-commerce being developed at Center of Excellence for E-Commerce. This is referred to as CMC's Suite of E-Commerce Technologies. We also present TWINS test-bed application being developed as part of this project.

40|$|Information {{security}} {{is not just}} to provide an authenticity and integrity to the data, {{but there is also a}} need to seek identity, rights of use and origin of information, which may require some degree of process re-engineering. Rarely security technologies like digital signatures can be simply "plugged in" without streamlining the process. In this paper we address the problem of information security and protecting the rights of originator of the structured document from ill-intentioned recipient who can modify the received decrypted information. At sender end, a public key signature is generated using SHA- 1 or SHA- 2. Signature is embedded into raster image of the document using non-invertible robust public key watermarking technique based on orthogonal signals concepts. The document is then encrypted with public key of the receiver using RSA algorithm to achieve confidentiality and authorization. The proposed scheme uses correlation analysis to detect embedded signature to authenticate message. This scheme also uses Gauss-Jordan method to derive the signature from the watermarked image to verify ownership. The study is corroborated with result and application of the proposed technique to prevent forgery and alteration in <b>e-cheque</b> document...|$|E
40|$|With {{the modern}} world going on-line for all {{business}}es, we need to transact with various business organizations {{all over the world}} using different modes of payment obtained through various Financial Institutions. We have considered the following bank transaction. A person X having an account in bank C issued a cheque for certain amount in favor of a person Y having an account in bank B. But, Y wants to issue a cheque for the same amount favoring Z. In normal course, Y need to deposit the cheque in bank B, wait for clearance and then issue a cheque in favor of Z. This consumes time as bank B sends the cheque to bank C for clearance. In this paper, we propose a scheme in which a cheque is transferable. That is, the cheque in favor of Y can be reissued for the same amount to Z without presenting in the bank. Person Z can deposit the cheque directly in his bank, thus saving time and work load on banks. Further, the scheme can be used to transfer the cheque to any number of persons and only the last person deposits in the bank. In view of this, <b>e-cheque</b> can be used as e-cash to a limited extent. Our scheme is based on multisignatures. We have augmented the multi-signature scheme to provide forward security. This guarantees the security of cheques signed in the past even if the signer’s secret key is exposed today...|$|E
