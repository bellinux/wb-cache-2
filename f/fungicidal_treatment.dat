40|$|The organic {{viticulture}} {{assumes a}} decisive {{role in the}} national agricultural sector. More impelling problems {{in the management of}} organic vineyards are represented by the plants pathology defence and particularly by Plasmopara viticola containment. Copper represents one of the few usable fungicides in the organic farming and the only one effective against downy mildew. The EC Regulation n. 473 / 2002 fixed the maximum usable quantity of copper compounds, owing to the environment problems due to the copper accumulation in the soil. To reduce quantity of metal copper or replace it with natural products, field trials with copper compounds at a low rate or with alternative copper products have been conducted in organic farms located near Rome. Besides, we have also estimated the possibility of reducing the operations against P. viticola optimizing <b>fungicidal</b> <b>treatments.</b> Guidelines EPPO/OEPP PP 1 / 31 (3) have been carried out.

The three groups of barley crop with {{different}} fungicide treatment {{were included in the}} experiment. The first group served as the control one without fungicide treatment. The second group of barley (variant A) was treated with Hutton (0. 8 L/ha at BBCH 36) + Zantar (1. 5 L/ha at BBCH 65). The third group of barley (variant B) was treated with the combination of Hutton (0. 8 L/ha at BBCH 36) + Prosaro EC 250 (0. 75 L/ha at BBCH 65). In the original mass of barely, ten levels of mycotoxins were established. Subsequently, the samples were incubated in the machine Daisy II for 24 hours. The cellulase and pepsin enzymes were used in the incubation. Following mycotoxins were determined in the incubation fluid such as dexynivalenol, zearalenone, deoxynivalenol- 3 -glucoside and 3 -acetyl-deoxynivalenol. In the variant A, the level of dexynivalenolu was higher by 36 %, zearalenone by about 2 %, deoxynivalenol- 3 -glucoside by 12 %, and 3 -acetyl-deoxynivalenol by 39 %. Low levels of the mycotoxins were found out in the variant B. Deoxynivalenol level was lower by 19 %, zearalenone by 30 %, deoxynivalenol- 3 -glucoside by 37 % (p 0. 05).

However, in the last 20 years frequent crop failures due to out breaks of wilt (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris), botrytis gray mold (Botrytis cinerea) and pod borer (Helicoverpa armigera) have made its cultivation unreliable and uneconomical.

40|$|In 2001 – 2004 an {{influence}} of gradually increased portions of nitrogen (100 – 130 – 160 kg/N. ha– 1) applied on the wheat variety Ebi {{in combination with}} the modified fungicidal protection in the yield and the selected quality grain parameters were observed within the small-plot field trials. Nitrogenous fertilizers according to the amount of nitrogen contained were applied in 2 – 4 terms during vegetation in regeneration (55 kg/N. ha– 1), 1 st production (45 kg/N. ha– 1), 2 nd production (30 kg/N. ha– 1) and qualitative portion (30 kg/N. ha– 1). The fungicidal protection was based on the equal treatment in the phase of BBCH 37 and with regard to the varieties different treatment in the phase of BBCH 55. The dependence on the year was proved at all observed parameters. Higher intensity of nitrogenous fertilization had no decisive impact on the yields. From {{the point of view of}} increased yields, the second production nitrogenous fertilization had the strongest impact; it increased the grain yields by 0. 084 – 0. 461  t. /ha– 1. Higher intensity of nitrogenous fertilization positively influenced the baker’s grain quality. The increased portions of nitrogen decisively increased the volume of N-substances in all trial years. The second production nitrogenous fertilization increased the N-substances volume from 0. 1 to 0. 8 %. Qualitative additional fertilization increased their volume from 0. 26 to 1. 38 %. Higher N portions increased sedimentation in most cases. The falling number was not considerably influenced. The mechanical grain qualities (volume weight, number full grains, and GTW) were relatively less influenced than the baker’s quality by the nitrogenous fertilization. The application of fungicides positively influenced not only the yields but also mechanical qualities of the grain, i. e. volume weight, thousand grains weight and portion of Full grains. On the contrary the baker’s quality was not decisively influenced. It was proved that the decisive <b>fungicidal</b> <b>treatment</b> is the one applied in the period of coming to ear (BBCH 55). Single <b>fungicidal</b> <b>treatment</b> in the early period of the flag leaves (BBCH 37) increased the yields only by 6 % and the grain quality was not decisively influenced. Double treatment then increased the yields by 18. 15 % in average. The highest increases were reached at fungicidal varieties fertilized with the nitrogen portion (19. 55 %), the lowest after application of the N portion on the level of 100 kg/ha– 1. Here the grain yields were also in average 16. 77 % higher than the yields of the untreated varieties. The highest grain yields after the application of fungicide was reached in 2003 (26. 16 %) and the lowest in 2001 (14. 16 %). The differences in the yields at the varieties with the full fungicidal protection and different spectrum of fungicides used were not statistically evident in the trial duration. The increase in the yields contrary to untreated variety and the variety with the limited fungicidal protection (application of fungicides only in BBCH 37) was statistically evident in most cases. The least effective was the impact of the fungicide Caramba in the portion of 1 l/ha– 1. On the contrary, the varieties containing the fungicides with the agent from the group of strobilurins including Charisma containing the agent of famoxate proved very good results. GTW was most influenced by the fungicidal protection. The relative increase of GTW was between 7. 53 – 11. 48 %. This value was positively influenced by the application of Juwel followed by Amistar in full as well as reduced portion combined with azol contained in Caramba. With regard to the fact that these trends were reached in all years of the trial, we can say that strobilurins have the positive impact on the value of this parameter. In average of the trial duration as well as in particular years the positive impact of the double <b>fungicidal</b> <b>treatment</b> on the number of full grains (2. 76 – 3. 37 % increase) was proved.

During 2007 - 15, significant postharvest research and development (R&D) work was conducted under the Australian-funded ASLP mango supply chain management/value chain improvement projects (two phases). The project started by laying a postharvest foundation R&D infrastructure in 2007. Fruit quality losses in supply chains were documented. Protocols were developed for maturity testing, desapping, storage/sea-freighting, and ripening and postharvest disease management of major mango cultivars. Quantity loss (unmarketable fruit) was around 20 % while quality loss (affecting price) was 65 and 70 % in Sindhri and Samar Bahisht Chaunsa mango, respectively. Sap burn and postharvest diseases were the most important fruit quality issues at retail. Cultivars differed in terms of fruit harvest maturity indicators, postharvest treatment response, controlled atmosphere conditions and temperatures for storage and ripening. Besides physical de-sapping (on racks), lime wash (de-stemming and dipping fruit in 0. 5 % lime solution for 2 - 3 min) was also found to be effective, with morning being the best time for fruit picking. Significant relationships of production locality, orchard management, nutrition (Ca, B and K) and pre-cooling were found with postharvest disease incidence. Postharvest hot-water fungicidal dip of Scholar (active ingredient (a. i.) fludioxonil), Amistar (a. i. azoxystrobin) and Sportak (a. i. procholaz) gave significant fruit disease control. An integrated approach of good production practices, right maturity, correct postharvest <b>fungicidal</b> <b>treatments</b> and pre-cooling was an effective strategy for reducing disease incidence and maintaining better shelf-life at retail. On the basis of R&D and interventions, significant improvement was brought to the local mango industry and export. Sindhri mangoes were sea-freighted commercially to the EU and UK with good fruit quality outturn and overall postharvest life of 40 - 45 days...|$|R
40|$|Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) {{is subject}} to stress and yield {{reducing}} factors throughout the growing season. The loss of Delta and Pine Land 555 Bollgard? Roundup Ready? (DPL 555 BR) cotton in September 2009 removes a variety from the commercial market {{that proved to be}} a useful tool for farmers. This true full-season variety gave producers in regions of the U. S. Cotton Belt, where long growing season windows are established, the opportunity {{to take full advantage of}} extended growing days until harvest. The potential to delay the maturity of a mid-full season upland cotton variety, to that of the established full season variety, DPL 555 BR, may be possible through the determent of stress with fungicides. A two-year field study was conducted at the Texas AgriLife Research Farm in Burleson County in 2008 and 2009. The study evaluated the impact of pyraclostrobin, Headline?, and azoxystrobin, Quadris?, fungicides and their effect on yield and maturity after application to a mid-full season upland cotton variety, Stoneville 4554 Bollgard II? Roundup Ready Flex? (STV 4554 B 2 RF). These fungicides, along with commercially available tank-mix compounds, were applied to the study area at two defined growth stages: Early Bloom (EB), and Early Bloom + 14 days (EB+ 14). Data analyzed over the years of both studies indicated statistical and numerical differences for <b>fungicidal</b> <b>treatments.</b> Statistical differences were noted in measurements throughout the years of both Study 1 and Study 2. Final plant mapping measurements and fiber properties for both studies failed to show improvements of increased nodes or plant height, as well as the measurements obtained from HVI analysis, due to the additions of either pyraclostrobin or azoxystrobin compounds. Combining these strobilurin fungicides with the labeled compounds of mepiquat chloride or mepiquat chloride did not yield results detrimental to plant characteristics measured in these studies. The treatment timing of EB+ 14 that contained the pyraclostrobin compound increased lint yield versus the untreated control by 213 kg ha^(- 1) ...|$|R

A study on the <b>fungicidal</b> seed <b>treatment</b> and screening sorghum cultivars on gray leaf spot disease was investigated in a split plot arrangement using four seed dressing fungicides (Metalaxyl, Captan, Thiobendazole and Benomyl), untreated control and five sorghum cultivars (ICSV 111, ICSV 400, ICSH 89002 NG, ICSH 89009 NG and Q-L INDIA). The combined results of the two year revealed that synergistic interaction of cultivars (ICSV 111, ICSV 400, ICSH 89002 NG and ICSH 89009 NG) with Apron plus 50 Ds significantly reduced severity at 60 DAS from 40 to 25 % compared with untreated check. Similarly, Cultivars ((ICSV 111 and ICSV 400) with Apron plus 50 Ds brought about significant reduction in logistic infection from 0. 023 to 0. 0006 units per day over untreated check. This further culminated into better seedling establishment and grain yield were increased...|$|R

Often, however, the plant protection products are distributed in a non-targeted way, even when reduced incidence of pests do not require any treatment. In order to optimize the treatments against downy mildew, multi-annual field trials, both in conventional and organic vineyards, have been carried out. In all farms were considered 3 thesis: 1 untreated control thesis (Test), in order to follow the coarse of infection, 1 standard farm reference thesis (St), where the treatments were carried out according to the usual farm procedures and 1 experimental thesis (X). Guideline EPPO/OEPP PP 1 / 31 (3) have been carried out. We monitored different environmental parameters capable to influence Plasmopora viticola (Berk. and Curt.) Berl. and De Toni development. In fact by a network of RTUs (Remote Terminal Units) distributed all over the vineyards transmitting every 15 minutes via radio or via GPRS to a centralized Data Base 12 environmental parameters: time, data, precipitation, soil temperature, solar radiation, wind direction, wind speed, atmospheric relative humidity, atmospheric temperature, leaf wetness, soil humidity to cm 20 and soil humidity to cm 40. In different phenological growth stages we carried out careful disease assessments on leaves and bunches to evaluate the onset and development of P. viticola. We have studied the downy mildew infections through monitoring the environmental parameters, knowledge of P. viticola biological cycle, the evaluation of cultivar sensibility, the agricultural production method and the area characteristics, to try to optimize the anti- downy mildew treatments. The achieved results have underlined the possibility to obtain a satisfactory protection against P. viticola by correct placing of treatments. In experimental thesis (X) the number of treatments was generally lower than the number made on the thesis standard (ST), with efficacy comparable if not better. This result is most evident in conventional farms where surveillance is less accurate because is can also use plant protection products with a curative action. The trial showed the possibility of obtaining real cost containment management and a lower environmental impact associated with reduced <b>fungicidal</b> <b>treatments...</b>|$|R

40|$|Botrytis {{grey mould}} (BGM) {{is the major}} {{constraint}} to chickpea production in Bangladesh and is considered primarily responsible for that country's recent drastic decrease in chickpea production. There is no substantial host plant resistance to BGM in current chickpea cultivars, but component studies have developed various agronomic options to manage the disease. These include reduced seed rate, delayed sowing and thinning of plants to ensure an open canopy, and need-based foliar application of fungicide. These components were combined with other agronomic requirements for the target region, such as application of phosphate fertilizer, pest management measures against chickpea pod borer, and <b>fungicidal</b> seed <b>treatment</b> against collar rot. The resultant integrated crop management (ICM) package was compared with normal farmer practice (FP) for chickpea cultivation in farmer-managed, operational scale plots at 100 locations across five districts in western Bangladesh in the 2002 – 2003 and 2003 – 2004 seasons. Grain yields in ICM plots were generally 15 – 50 % higher than in FP in both seasons. Conduct of these on-farm evaluations in two additional districts in 2004 – 2005 gave similar results. In 2004 – 2005, 505 farmer-managed demonstrations were conducted in the five original districts, giving a 5 – 104 % yield advantage (district means) of ICM over FP. In 2005 – 2006, 642 demonstrations were conducted across the eight districts giving district-wise yield advantages of 27 – 70 %. Effective implementation of BGM management practices by participating farmers demonstrated that remunerative and reliable chickpea yields could be obtained in this BGM-prone environment. The ICM strategy evolved has relevance to other chickpea growing regions prone to BGM in South Asia, Australia and the Americas. Studies are now required on the adoption of components of the ICM package, and the underlying reasons, to identify any adoption constraints and thus guide further promotion of chickpea cultivation...|$|R
40|$|Head smut {{caused by}} Sphacelotheca reiliana (S. reiliana) is a devastating disease of maize {{that has been}} {{reported}} to account for up to 80 % yield loss in fields. This disease exists in many major maize growing regions and the disease incidence is rising. It has become a major constraint in seed production areas as the spores it produces adhere to and contaminate seeds. The fungus infects systemically during the seedling stage and usually does not produce symptoms until the plant reaches its reproductive stages when the fungus replaces the inflorescences with large black masses of teliospores known as sori. When the sori rupture spores contaminate soil and seed which will then serve as a source of inoculum and a dispersal unit for the fungus. Disease management options include host resistance and <b>fungicidal</b> seed <b>treatments</b> but both of these strategies need improvement; resistance in most commercial hybrids is not complete and more seed treatments need to be tested for efficacy against this disease. The strategies for evaluating both of these options require considerable time expenditure, as the plant does not show symptoms of infection throughout the growing season. With this in mind a seedling assay for the evaluation of host resistance and seed treatment efficacy would be advantageous. A seedling assay was developed using two novel inoculation techniques to consistently and efficiently infect maize seedlings with S. reiliana. Seeds were planted in a growth chamber under controlled conditions that were conducive to infection. Presence of the fungus within seedling tissue was detected by a sensitive and specific real-time polymerase chain reaction. Seed inoculation provided more consistent results than soil infestation. Five commercially available <b>fungicidal</b> seed <b>treatments</b> were tested for their efficacy against head smut infection, using the seedling assay. Infection rates of inoculated, mock-treated controls varied between 60 - 80 % Incidence of infection. Tebuconazole, fludioxonil and sedaxane seed treatments reduced incidence of seedling infection by S. reiliana (p= 0. 01) whereas azoxystrobin did not. Three rates, representing the ranges of rates on the product labels of both tebuconazole and sedaxane, were also tested. No differences in seedling infection were detected among the rates (p= 0. 01). Sedaxane (0. 1 mg*seed- 1) eliminated detectable seedling infection when teliospores of S. reiliana were applied at a rate of 10 spores*seed- 1. The assay was effective for seed treatment efficacy testing and can be a useful tool to screen experimental fungicides for their efficacy against head smut. The seedling assay was used to evaluate five maize inbred lines for their ability to resist infection by S. reiliana. Inbreds included A 619, B 68, B 73, Mo 17 and Va 26. Mo 17 had lower incidence of infection compared to the other four inbreds (p= 0. 01) but no other significant differences between inbreds were detected. We also evaluated maize tissue from a susceptible hybrid in field trials (in California and Texas) with inoculated seed and non-inoculated seed planted into S. reiliana infested soil. Seedling and ear shoot tests showed that S. reiliana DNA was present at rates as high as 54 % of seedlings in Texas and 11 % in California and 30 % of ear shoots in Texas and 8 % in California; despite these rates of infection no symptoms were observed by field scouting. This assay may be useful to compare initial infection of among maize genotypes, but the lack of symptom development indicates that seedling and ear shoot infection are not predictive of disease incidence. A high percentage of maize plants infected with S. reiliana may not exhibit any symptoms and this knowledge is important for designing management strategies. Further work is needed to better understand the implications of this result on the epidemiology of this disease and the mechanisms for resistance...|$|R

Antifungal activities of common thyme (Thymus vulgaris) essential oil were tested against endophytic fungi grown from wheat (Triticum aestivum) grain, molecularly identified as Alternaria alternata, Alternaria infectoria, Aspergillus fl avus, Epicoccum nigrum and Fusarium poae. Their susceptibility to thyme essential oil was tested in vitro, and ranged from <b>fungicidal</b> to fungistatic. <b>Treatment</b> combinations of prior grain surface sterilization with hypochlorite and direct/indirect treatment with the essential oil were used, which showed strong effects on infection incidence and germination. Direct soaking of the wheat grain in the essential oil was particularly effective, but inhibited both fungal growth and seed germination. In contrast, indirect treatment of the grain with the essential oil (i. e., fumigation) inhibited fungal growth without negative effects on seed germination. In combination with grain surface sterilization with hypochlorite, indirect treatment with thyme essential oil reduced these fungal infections even more.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Trichophyton rubrum is {{the most}} common agent of {{superficial}} mycosis of the skin and nails causing long lasting infections and high recurrence rates. Current treatment drawbacks involve topical medications not being able to reach the nail bed at therapeutic concentrations, systemic antifungal drugs failing to eradicate the fungus before the nails are renewed, severe side effects and selection of resistant fungal isolates. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a promising alternative to conventional treatments. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the in vitro effectiveness of toluidine blue O (TBO) irradiated by Light emitting diode (LED) in the reduction of T. rubrum viability. METHODS: The fungal inoculums' was prepared and exposed to different TBO concentrations and energy densities of Light emitting diode for evaluate the T. rubrum sensibility to PDT and production effect <b>fungicidal</b> after photodynamic <b>treatment.</b> In addition, the profiles of the area and volume of the irradiated fungal suspensions were also investigated. RESULTS: A small reduction, in vitro, of fungal cells was observed after exposition to 100 µM toluidine blue O irradiated by 18 J/cm² Light emitting diode. Fungicidal effect occurred after 25 µM toluidine blue O irradiation by Light emitting diode with energy density of 72 J/cm². The analysis showed that the area and volume irradiated by the Light emitting diode were 52. 2 mm² and 413. 70 mm³, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results allowed to conclude that Photodynamic therapy using Light emitting diode under these experimental conditions is a possible alternative approach to inhibit in vitro T. rubrum and may be a promising new treatment for dermatophytosis caused by this fungus...|$|R
40|$|Fluconazole (FLZ) {{has emerged}} as a highly {{successful}} agent in the management of systemic infections of Candida. Cure rates for symptomatic candidiasis following single 150 -mg FLZ dose therapy exceed 90 %. In vitro, however, FLZ is fungistatic only in a narrow pH range and is not effective at vaginal pH, 4. 2. This study evaluated the effect of FLZ on Candida albicans under in vitro conditions resembling the vaginal microenvironment, using vagina-simulative medium (VS). We found that FLZ was fungicidal for C. albicans in VS, but not in other media at the same pH, 4. 2. In VS, FLZ was fungicidal at concentrations of ≥ 8 μg/ml and reduced viability by greater than 99. 9 %. Analysis of the components of VS indicated that 17 mM acetic acid, a concentration achieved in the vagina, was responsible for the synergistic, fungicidal effect. This effect was not seen at neutral pH. Other substrates were not effective substitutes for acetic acid; however, short-chained carboxylic acids, glyoxylate and malonate, were effective. Most strains of C. albicans that were resistant to FLZ under standard conditions were killed by FLZ plus acetate. Other species of Candida were also killed, except C. krusei and C. glabrata. This study shows that FLZ has fungicidal activity for Candida species under in vitro conditions that mimic the vaginal microenvironment. This raises the possibility that FLZ may also have <b>fungicidal</b> effects during <b>treatment</b> of vaginal candidiasis. Elucidating the mechanism by which FLZ and acetate interact may disclose vulnerable pathways that could be exploited in drug development...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{main source}} of {{ochratoxin}} A (OTA) in the wine food chain is the infection of grape by “black aspergilli” occurring in the field. OTA producing black aspergilli include mainly Aspergillus carbonarius, followed by A. niger and A. tubingensis. They are opportunistic fungi developing massively on damaged berries at ripening, although they may occur and form OTA on grapes from veraison to harvest. Climatic conditions (high humidity and temperature) and geographical location are important factors favouring OTA accumulation in grape berries. The severity of aspergillus rot is influenced by excessive irrigation and rainfall prior to harvest causing berry splitting. Berry wounds caused by insect attacks provide preferential entries for black aspergilli. High OTA levels occur in grapes severely damaged by the grape moth Lobesia botrana, particularly in the Mediterranean areas. Some grape varieties displays greater susceptibility to aspergillus rots due to intrinsic genetic characteristics and bunch conformation (compact > sparse). Actions to control toxigenic mycoflora in the vineyards must be taken considering these critical control points. Proper <b>fungicidal</b> and insecticidal <b>treatments</b> can reduce OTA contamination. Knowledge {{about the fate of}} OTA and its distribution in wine and winery by-products is important to manage OTA risk in contaminated stocks. During wine making only 4 % of the OTA present in grapes remains in the wine whereas the most is retained in pressed grape pomaces. OTA concentration remains unchanged in wine after one year aging as well as in all liquid fractions collected during vinification (must, free run wine, and wine after first and second decantation).
