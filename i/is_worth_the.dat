5|$|Sawyer and Kate {{begin the}} episode on Alex's canoe with an {{unconscious}} Karl, paddling {{away from the}} Hydra island. Kate suggests returning for Jack; however, Sawyer refuses. Kate and Sawyer land on the main island and question Karl about the Others. Karl reveals that the Others work on the Hydra island, but live on the main island. The next morning, Sawyer finds Karl crying in the jungle. Karl {{says that he is}} crying because he misses Alex. Sawyer asks Karl if he is in love, which Karl affirms to be true. Sawyer tells him that love <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> risks of getting caught by the Others and lets Karl go into the jungle to find Alex.|$|E
5|$|Schiavo {{describes}} how the FAA uses a formula ascribing specific monetary value to human lives, and how the agency allows numbers {{to decide whether the}} cost of extra safety <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> additional expense. For example, if equipping an airline fleet with smoke detectors would cost $100 million, but would only save 10 lives each worth $1 million, then the expense is ruled out. Schiavo is similarly critical of the internal FAA politics and the FAA's administrators.|$|E
5|$|After local {{businessman}} Paul Robinson {{is pushed}} from Lassiter's mezzanine, Mark {{is placed in}} charge of the investigation. He goes to the crime scene and then to the hospital to speak with Paul's wife, Rebecca. Mark learns Paul made several enemies before the attempt on his life and Diana Marshall becomes the prime suspect. Mark questions several Erinsborough residents, including Paul's son, Andrew, and Kate Ramsay, who gives Rebecca an alibi. When Andrew tries to help the investigation along, Mark warns him not to try and do his job for him. Paul wakes up from his coma and implies that Diana pushed him. She flees the country. Weeks later, Mark asks Kate out to dinner and after initially turning him down, she agrees. Their date is interrupted by Declan and Kate leaves. Declan and Mark later fight over Kate, but she is only interested in Mark. After Kate confronts Mark about making threats towards Declan, they break up. Kate learns Declan was lying and she apologises to Mark. She kisses him in front of his colleagues, making him realise that she <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> risk. Mark tells Kate that he needs to solve Paul's case to prove himself to his superiors, but he decides that {{he does not want to}} sacrifice their relationship and he gives up the case.|$|E

25|$|One {{example is}} voting in the United States. Even though most {{people say that}} voting is important, and a good {{practice}} for them to do, every year a sub-optimal percentage of Americans turn up to vote, especially in presidential elections (only 51% in the 2000 election). One vote may feel very small {{in a group of}} millions, so people may not think a vote <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> time and effort. If too many people think this way, there is a small percentage of voter turnout. Some countries enforce compulsory voting to reduce this effect.|$|E

25|$|Given that {{a factor}} {{is used in}} the {{production}} of a range of first-order goods, its value is determined by the good that <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> least among all the goods in the range. This value is determined at the margin, the marginal utility of the last unit of the least valuable good produced by the factor. In connection with his opportunity cost, the value so derived represents an opportunity cost across all industries, and the values of the factors of production and goods are determined in the whole system. Thus, supply and demand do not develop into the determinants of value; the determinant of value is the marginal utility.|$|E

500|$|Mighty Jill Off has {{received}} generally positive reception. Retronauts' Jess Ragan praised Anthropy for {{her understanding of}} what made Mighty Bomb Jack good. 1UP.com's Scott Sharkey listed Mighty Jill Off {{as one of his}} favourite independently-developed freeware games in 2009. Gamasutra listed it as one of their runners-up for the top five best indie games of 2008. On two separate occasions, IndieGames' timw listed Mighty Jill Off as [...] "game picks"; first for the original version, and second for Mighty Jill Off - Jill Off Harder Edition. GamesRadar's Nathan Meuiner listed the game as one of the [...] "most ruthlessly punishing indie games" [...] and wrote that the difficulty level may make players question whether the [...] "pain of a million deaths <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> pleasure awaiting" [...] players.

500|$|The Canadian Presss Christy Lemire {{stated that}} the film was a [...] "gorgeous, provocative look at humanity" [...] and {{observed}} that like its characters, the film [...] "demands much of its audiences emotionally". She concluded that Never Let Me Go <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> investment. The Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan thought that the film was [...] "passionate about deliberation and restraint" [...] and believed that the latter may not appeal to all audiences. Scott Bowles, writing for USA Today, gave the film a negative review, declaring [...] "never was a movie so bleak and empty". He claimed that Never Let Me Go did not [...] "embrace the book's unrelentingly dark tones", but rather wallowed in them. He commented that not even the cast's performance, particularly Garfield's, were enough to redeem the film. New York Times journalist Manohla Dargis said that the film presented [...] "the aspect of a tasteful shocker" [...] because its [...] "cruelty is done so prettily and with such caution that the sting remains light".|$|E
500|$|Where {{funds are}} mixed with those of another trust, or mixed with the funds of an [...] "innocent volunteer", certain general {{principles}} apply. As laid out in Re Diplock, the principle applied is that the claimant's entitlement ranks pari passu {{to that of the}} volunteer; each has an equal claim to their funds. Whether the fund decreases or increases in value, each party can claim a percentage equal to their contribution. The problem here comes if the mixed funds are used in unequal chunks to acquire other property. The long-standing rule is that established in Clayton's Case; that the money deposited first is deemed to be spent on the first property purchased. The problem with this is that if the first property becomes less valuable than the second property purchased, the first claimant loses some of their money while the second claimant is able to claim their money in its entirety. The alternate approach is the previously mentioned pari passu idea; whatever the total property <b>is</b> <b>worth,</b> <b>the</b> claimants get a share proportionate to their input, without assuming that the first claimant's money is tied to the first property purchased and the second claimant's money to the second property. In Barlow Clowes International v Vaughan, the Court of Appeal applied a similar set of principles, holding that the size of the contribution and the amount of time the money was part of the mixed fund were the factors to be considered.|$|E

500|$|Gosling {{played an}} {{introvert}} who {{falls in love}} with a sex doll in the 2007 film Lars and the Real Girl. He drew inspiration from James Stewart's performance in Harvey. Roger Ebert felt [...] "a film about a life-sized love doll" [...] had been turned into [...] "a life-affirming statement of hope" [...] because of [...] "a performance by Ryan Gosling that says things that cannot be said". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post described his performance as [...] "a small miracle ... because he changes and grows so imperceptibly before our eyes." [...] However, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt [...] "the performance is a rare miscalculation in a mostly brilliant career." [...] He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. The film was a box office failure, failing to recoup its $12 million production budget. Gosling starred opposite Anthony Hopkins in the 2007 courtroom thriller Fracture. He originally turned down the role, but changed his mind when Hopkins signed on. Gosling noted that he was drawn to his character, Willie, because he had flaws and seemed like a real person. He spent time shadowing lawyers and observing courtroom proceedings in preparation for the role. Claudia Puig of USA Today declared that [...] "watching a veteran like Hopkins verbally joust with one of the best young actors in Hollywood <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> price of admission". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt it was a treat to watch [...] "the spectacle of that crafty scene stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen nibbler Ryan Gosling ... Each actor is playing a pulp type rather than a fully formed individual, but both fill in the blanks with an alchemical mix of professional and personal charisma." [...] The film grossed over $91 million worldwide.|$|E
