500|$|Betty Driver, who {{had been}} {{performing}} since she was 8 years old, retired from acting in her late forties to run hotels in Cheshire and Derbyshire. It was here that she was spotted by one of her customers, producer of Coronation Street, Harry Kershaw, who persuaded her to audition {{for the role of}} Hilda Ogden in 1964; she eventually had to turn the role down as she was tied into an advertising contract with Procter & Gamble and they refused to release her. The part of Hilda eventually went to Jean Alexander. Driver has commented, [...] "Harry Kershaw, producer of Coronation Street, persuaded me to audition for Hilda Ogden – just think I could have been wearing curlers for 30 years." [...] In 1969, she was cast as the new character, Betty Turpin. Commenting on her casting in 1999, Driver said, [...] " [...] said, 'Betty, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> pull pints for us on television?', and that was it. I suppose I expected I'd be there for perhaps a few months. But it just went on and on and, well, they've never managed to get rid of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1996, Stuart {{received}} a message about a film role: [...] "A female voice {{said she was}} calling from Lightstorm Entertainment...about a movie to be shot on location, maybe Poland...about the Titanic, directed by James Cameron..." [...] The next afternoon, Cameron’s casting director, Mali Finn, came to Stuart’s house [...] "…with her assistant, Emily Schweber, who was carrying a video camera... Mali and I talked while Emily filmed us." [...] The next morning, Finn brought over James Cameron and his video camera. Stuart wrote, [...] "I was {{not the least bit}} nervous. I knew I would read Old Rose with the sympathy and tenderness that Cameron had intended…" [...] Five days after Stuart's eighty-sixth birthday, Finn phoned again and asked, “Gloria, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be Old Rose?” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{take the}} matter of children. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> become the father--and a mere glance around you will show you that the chances are {{enormously}} in favour {{of such a thing}} happening--of a boy with spectacles and protruding front teeth who asks questions all the time? Out of six small boys whom I saw when I came on board, four wore spectacles and had teeth like rabbits. The other two were equally revolting in different styles. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> become the father...?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{why should}} you WANT to talk in that dreadful way? <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have people talk so about YOU, and you not cold yet?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why don't {{her teeth}} come through, then," [...] {{retorted}} Johnny, {{in a loud}} rebellious voice, [...] "instead of bothering me? <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> it yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't hang back, Brace, for I {{wish to see}} you as well. I want to {{take your}} butty away, and give <b>you</b> Fred instead. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{women are}} always {{asking us to}} give up {{harmless}} little things just because you don't approve of them. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> it if we did the same by you, miss?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{how about}} it? You're out for adventure. <b>How</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> work for me? All quite unofficial, you know. Expenses paid, and a {{moderate}} screw?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Happy thought!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I {{came out}} here to write letters, not caring for fishing, {{especially}} in boats; <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> me to write {{the rest of the}} story from your dictation?" ...|$|R
