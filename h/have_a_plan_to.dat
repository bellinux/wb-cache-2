5|$|Misery banishes {{the player}} to the Labyrinth {{deep inside the}} island as {{punishment}} for interfering with the Doctor's plans. Curly Brace has also been thrown into the Labyrinth and they cooperate to escape. Balrog helps them to move the boulder blocking the exit, revealing his kind nature. The pair find and defeat the Core, a magical creature whose power keeps the island afloat. However, the Doctor steps in to save it before the island collapses. Depending on certain conditions, the player may rescue Curly Brace, who had sacrificed her air tank to save the player character. When he returns to Mimiga Village, he finds that the Doctor has captured the Mimigas. In the Egg Corridor, Kazuma offers the player a choice to escape the island with him using a Sky Dragon, leading to an alternate ending in which the Doctor conquers the surface world while Kazuma and the player hide in the mountains. The player may instead choose to confront the Doctor and destroy the island's Core, which would return the Mimigas to normal. The player scales the outer wall of the island to reach the Plantation where the Doctor is using the Mimigas as slave laborers to grow red flowers. The Doctor's servants capture the player and place him in a jail cell with Sue. She is taken away before the player wakes up, but her letter reveals that the Doctor {{was a member of}} the research expedition that included Sue's family and Professor Booster, but he betrayed them once he found the Demon Crown. Sue directs the player to find her mother who may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> stop the Doctor.|$|E
25|$|Olkar {{wants to}} seize the diadem of Vishnu, the great {{treasure}} of Benares, but Démaly refuses to say where it is hidden. Olkar places Laméa in Démaly's prison cell, hoping she will lure him into revealing the location. Instead, she tells Démaly that an army of rescuers {{is on its way}} from Ellabad. The bayaderes also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> trick the Mahrattas. She tells Olkar she knows where the diadem is but will only bring it to him after a victory celebration in Benares. The festivities take place and the bayaderes lull the Mahrattas with their dancing and intoxicating drinks and secretly take away their weapons. Laméa now gives the signal for the rescuing army to attack. Led by Démaly, who has been freed from prison, they defeat the Mahrattas.|$|E
25|$|Following the Korean Air 801 crash, it {{was brought}} to the NTSB's {{attention}} that foreign carriers flying {{in and out of the}} US were not covered by the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996 and Korean Air did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> deal with the situation they encountered. As a result, US Congress passed the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act of 1997 to require those carriers to file family assistance plans and fulfill the same family support requirements as domestic airlines. Not only does the Act ensure that all victims and family members will be treated equitably, regardless of the carrier they use, it also impels many carriers that may not have thought about family assistance issues to give them due consideration in their emergency response plans.|$|E

2500|$|While {{renewables}} {{have been}} very successful in their ever-growing contribution to electrical power there are no countries dominated by fossil fuels who <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> stop and get that power from renwables. Only Scotland and Ontario have stopped burning coal, largely due to good natural gas supplies. In the area of transportation, fossil fuels are even more entrenched and solutions harder to find. It's unclear if there are failures with policy or renewable energy, but twenty years after the Kyoto Protocol [...] fossil fuels are still our primary energy source and consumption continues to grow.|$|E
2500|$|On August 23, 1958, People's Liberation Army forces {{commenced}} shelling Republic of China {{forces on}} the islands of Quemoy and Matsu, initiating the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. Felt immediately deployed the Seventh Fleet to help the Nationalist government defend Quemoy's supply lines. [...] "We didn't go to war then because we were strong and moved in a deterrent force," [...] he later concluded. During the crisis, Felt and his staff planned {{for the use of}} tactical nuclear weapons in the Taiwan Strait because they believed the use of such weapons would not trigger World War III and because [...] "we didn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> do it any other way".|$|E
2500|$|Guevara's heirs {{also believe}} they have legal {{justification}} to prevent the image's [...] "exploitation" [...] or slander. Guevara's Cuban widow Aleida March stated in 2005 that [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> deal with the misuse. We can't attack everyone with lances like Don Quixote, but {{we can try to}} maintain the ethics of Guevara's legacy." [...] In reference to this pronouncement, Guevara's daughter Aleida Guevara told Reuters, [...] "It will be costly and difficult because each country has different laws, but a limit has to be drawn." [...] However, the family has not yet mounted any court challenges, and no determination of legal copyright internationally has been established.|$|E

2500|$|During an {{appearance}} on Face the Nation, Wasserman Schultz said, [...] "The Republicans <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> end Medicare as we know it. What they would do is they would take {{the people who are}} younger than 55 years old today and tell them, 'You know what? You're on your own. Go and find private health insurance in the health-care insurance market.. Four non-partisan fact-checkers called her claim false. She then came under criticism for her comments on Washington Watch with Roland Martin, in which she said, [...] "You have the Republicans, who want to literally drag us {{all the way back to}} Jim Crow laws and literally—and very transparently—block access to the polls to voters who are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates than Republican candidates". The next day, she stated that [...] "Jim Crow was the wrong analogy to use".|$|E
2500|$|The {{networks}} {{also agreed}} to air a response from Dion, which aired around 7:30 pm ET. In it, Dion attacked the Conservatives, stating they did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> weather the economic crisis and he claimed that Canadians did not want another election, instead preferring that parliament work together during this time. [...] "Within one week, a new direction will be established, a tone and focus will be set. We will gather with leaders of industry and labour to work, unlike the Conservatives, in a collaborative, but urgent manner to protect jobs." [...] This statement, intended to air immediately following Harper's, was late in arriving to the networks and was of low video quality, prompting the party to apologize; CBC Television network anchorman Peter Mansbridge compared the quality of Dion's video to YouTube. CTV Television Network had already signed off its special broadcast before Dion's statement arrived. CTV commentator Robert Fife stated that the New Democrats and Bloc Québécois were [...] "angry" [...] {{with the quality of}} Dion's address.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{is set in}} the mid 21st {{century when}} the world has fallen into the chaos of the [...] "Great Population Flood", and takes place aboard the Queen of the World, a city-sized luxury ocean vessel, built by a group of {{corporate}} giants known as the Five Founding Fathers; the group who, due to the QOTW, have prospered {{while the rest of the}} world suffered. [...] At the beginning of the game, the craft is bombed by a group of fanatical terrorists known as the Malthusiansnamed after political economist Thomas Malthus who predicted that population growth would one day outpace agricultural production, returning society to a subsistent level of existence. The Malthusians <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> murder the vast majority of humans on the planet, so that the survivors wouldn't suffer from the effects of the population explosion. Their slogans, including [...] "Save the World - Kill Yourself", are written on the walls and displayed on computer screens all over the ship. Kate Wilson, the protagonist, is a systems engineer who becomes a reluctant hero when the Malthusians attack and take over the QOTW.|$|E
