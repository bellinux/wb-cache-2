40|$|Modern active vehicle {{safety systems}} rely on certain vehicle motion states to function. ABS {{requires}} the vehicle longitudinal speed {{to calculate the}} tire slip. The vehicle speed is typically estimated using the speed of all the wheels and is therefore dependent on the slip states of all the wheels. <b>Electronic</b> <b>stability</b> <b>programs</b> can also make more informed decisions if the vehicle side-slip angle is known. Currently the side-slip angle is not measured on commercial vehicles due {{to the cost of}} the sensors. The side-slip angle can however be estimated using multiple onboard vehicle measurements. However, these estimation techniques require accurate sensors and large excitations to estimate accurately. The measurement of the vehicle motion is therefore crucial for modern vehicle safety systems. This paper proposes a method whereby all 6 vehicle velocities can be measured using inexpensive forward facing mono and stereo cameras utilizing Digital Image Correlation (DIC) algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Previous work on car-trailer {{stability}} {{has been}} largely limited to theoretical studies with some reference to practical experience or accident statistics. In this study, extensive and systematic experimental investigations were carried out oil a combined car-adjustable-trailer system. The influence of different trailer parameters on the system high-speed stability was examined by changing the mass, dimensions, and inertial characteristics of a fully adjustable trailer. It {{was found that the}} dominant factors affecting stability were the trailer yaw inertia, nose mass (mass distribution), and trailer axle position. The tyre pressure also affects the stability, although this effect is less significant. It is interesting to see that the trailer mass alone does not dramatically affect the high-speed stability, as this runs contrary to current guidelines relating to limits on the relative mass of the car and trailer. Experimental tests on a friction stabilizer and on car <b>electronic</b> <b>stability</b> <b>programs</b> demonstrate that both of these improve the high-speed stability and help to delay the onset of 'snaking'...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes how {{the test}} case Sine With Dwell could be {{modified}} {{for the evaluation}} of yaw stability of heavy vehicles. The test case was originally proposed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for evaluation of <b>Electronic</b> <b>Stability</b> <b>Programs</b> (ESP) performance during an oversteer situation on high friction. The modified test case presented here accounts for the heavy vehicle dynamics through three main modifications of the original test case. Firstly, to avoid rollover, the test case is performed on low friction. Secondly, to avoid excess understeer behaviour, the steering input frequency is lowered compared to the original test. Thirdly, to account for response times, the responsiveness and stability criteria are modified. These modifications are derived from hardware in the loop simulations and field tests for different tractor/truck and trailer combinations. By using the modified responsiveness and stability criteria it was shown that the tested ESP system could be objectively evaluated. A clear improvement on vehicle stability was seen in the results when ESP was used...|$|R

2500|$|Electronic {{stability}} control (ESC), {{also referred}} to as <b>electronic</b> <b>stability</b> <b>program</b> (ESP) or dynamic stability control (DSC), is a computerized technology that improves a vehicle's stability by detecting and reducing loss of traction (skidding). When ESC detects loss of steering control, it automatically applies the brakes to help [...] "steer" [...] the vehicle where the driver intends to go. Braking is automatically applied to wheels individually, such as the outer front wheel to counter oversteer or the inner rear wheel to counter understeer. Some ESC systems also reduce engine power until control is regained. ESC does not improve a vehicle's cornering performance; instead, it helps to minimize the loss of control. [...] According to Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, one-third of fatal accidents could be prevented by the use of the technology.|$|E

40|$|English When {{developing}} modern {{control systems}} like anti-lock braking systems (ABS), traction control (TC), brake assistant (BAS) and <b>electronic</b> <b>stability</b> <b>programs</b> (ESP) to increase safety and comfort in vehi-cles, accurate tyre models are very important. Numerical simulation models {{are needed to}} predict the vehicle’s behaviour for various driving conditions. Testing facilities like the tyre measurement tower are needed to provide the necessary experimental data to validate these tyre models. The tyre measurement tower of the Dynamics and Control section of the TU Eindhoven, is already capable of simulating different situations, but it needs hydraulic actuators to subject the wheel to vertical vibra-tions and alternating steer angles. This report discusses {{the design of a}} vertical hydraulic actuator for the tyre measurement tower. A theoretical model of the hydraulic actuator and the measurement tower is developed, to determine what size of hydraulic cylinder is needed to fulfill the demands for good tyre measurement. This is done for a-symmetrical and symmetrical cylinder types. The size of these hydraulic cylinders limit the choice between servo valves, and this choice has a substantial effect on the dynamics of the total system. Some available hydraulic cylinders and servo valves ar...|$|R
40|$|Friction braking is {{necessarily}} related to high thermal loads which may cause {{problems such as}} hot spotting and the associated hot judder phenomenon. The driver may experience brake judder as vibrations in the frequency range below 100 Hz in the steering wheel, brake pedal and floor. It is state-of-the-art to investigate the thermal and thermoelastic behaviour of brakes in elaborate finite element studies, which provide high resolution results but require a high computational effort. As a consequence, thermal and thermoelastic issues could not be considered so far in brake models intended {{to be used for}} a system-dynamical analysis of the complete vehicle that may necessary to set up control strategies such as <b>electronic</b> <b>stability</b> <b>programs.</b> With this backgrouns, the article introduces a new method to model brake discs and to account for their thermal amd thermoelastic behaviour while braking in a very efficient way. Effects such as the temperature dependency on friction and the change of contact conditions between the disc and the pad caused by thermal and mechanical influences may be considered with much less computational effort and an acceptable accuracy when compared with the finite element method...|$|R

30|$|DB {{systems can}} {{slow down the}} vehicle and make the driver feel safe under {{high-speed}} conditions. In addition, the trajectory deviation caused by DB is smaller than that caused by AS. DB systems can also be easily implemented in conventional braking systems. For instance, <b>electronic</b> <b>stability</b> <b>programs,</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>stability</b> control (ESC), and direct yaw moment control (DYC) are widely used in heavy-duty vehicles, which apply DB or driving torques on wheels such that the vehicle active safety can be greatly improved [4 – 6]. By contrast, AS systems can generate an external yaw movement by actively turning the vehicle wheels in a small range [7]. Three types of AS, namely active front steering (AFS) [8, 9], active rear steering (ARS) [10], and four-wheel steering [11], are defined in existing literature. The AS system cannot generate the required yaw moment under certain circumstances [12]. The control effects and limits of AS and DB have been extensively discussed in literature. Koibuchi et al. [13] discussed {{the pros and cons}} of the DB system for a passenger car and concluded that when an inward moment is needed, the braking force is applied to the rear-inner wheel and vice versa. Yang et al. [14] showed the effects of all-wheel AS for a three-axle truck. Balázs et al. [15] discussed the steering angle limit and steering rate limit and proposed different actuation-level steering control methods for articulated vehicles. They presented the effects and limitations of each control method without comparing them and without providing selection criteria for specific conditions.|$|R

40|$|Truck {{operations}} have recently {{become an important}} focus of academic research not only because road freight transport is {{a key part of}} logistics, but because trucks are usually associated with negative externalities including pollution, congestion and traffic accidents. While the negative environmental impacts of truck activities have been extensively analyzed, comparatively little {{attention has been paid to}} the role of trucks in road accidents. A review of the literature identifies various truck-traffic safety related issues: frequency of accidents and their determinants; risk factors associated with truck driver behavior (including cell phone use, fatigue, alcohol and drugs consumption); truck characteristics and facilities (roadway types, specific lanes and <b>electronic</b> <b>stability</b> <b>programs)</b> to improve performance of vehicle maneuvering; and the safety characteristics of heavy and large trucks. However, to date, there seems to have been developed few studies evaluating the complex coexistence of trucks and cars on roads and that may support the implementation of differential road safety strategies applied to them. This paper focuses on the impact on the traffic fatalities rate of the interaction between trucks and cars on roads. We also assess the efficiency of two stricter road safety regulations for trucks, as yet not harmonized in the European Union; namely, speed limits and maximum blood alcohol concentration rates. For this, econometric models have been developed from a panel data set for European Union during the years 1999 ? 2010. Our findings show that rising motorization rates for trucks lead to higher traffic fatalities, while rising motorization rates for cars do not. Furthermore, we also find that lower maximum speed limits for trucks are effective and maximum blood alcohol concentration rates for professional drivers are only effective when they are strictly set to zero. Therefore, our results point to that the differential treatment of trucks is not only adequate for mitigating an important source of congestion and pollution, but that the implementation of stricter road safety measures in European countries for the case of trucks also contributes significantly to reducing fatalities. In summary, and as a counterpoint to the negative impact of trucks on road traffic accidents, we conclude the effectiveness of efforts made in road safety policy (based on specific traffic regulations by vehicle type imposed by member States) to counteract the safety externalities of freight transportation in the European Union. In certain sense, our study might provide indirect support to public policies implemented at the macro European level to promote multimodal transport corridors. In this respect, there is an increasing focus at the European level on how freight transport can be moved from trucks on roads to more environmentally-sustainable modes, such as rail and ship...|$|R

In particular the interest of robust control approaches (such as H 1 approach for Linear Parameter Varying systems), and of predictive ones (such as Model Predictive control) has been recently emphasized {{in the context of}} active suspension.
