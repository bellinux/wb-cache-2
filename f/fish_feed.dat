5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in humans who handle them. Turtles and some <b>fish</b> <b>feed</b> mainly on sponges. It {{is often said}} that sponges produce {{chemical}} defenses against such predators. However an experiment showed {{that there is no}} relationship between the toxicity of chemicals produced by sponges and how they taste to fish, which would diminish the usefulness of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish may even help to spread sponges by detaching fragments.|$|E
5|$|Like other caprellids, C. mutica are preyed upon {{predominantly}} by {{fish and}} crabs. In their native habitats, the predators of Caprellamutica include the shore crab Carcinus maenas and the goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris) which consume them in large numbers. Other predators include nudibranchs, starfish, nemertean worms, sea anemones, and hydrozoans. They constitute a valuable food source for these organisms {{due to their}} high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids. They also provide an important link in the food chain between plankton and larger fish. This, {{in addition to their}} relative abundance and fast growth rates, make them a potentially important resource for marine <b>fish</b> <b>feed</b> in aquaculture. Introduced populations of C.mutica have become {{a major part of the}} diets of native wild and farmed fish.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of terns cannot {{accommodate}} under water, so {{they rely}} on accurate sighting from the air before they plunge-dive. Like other seabirds that feed at the surface or dive for food, terns have red oil droplets in the cones of their retinas; birds that have to look through an air/water interface have more deeply coloured carotenoid pigments in the oil drops than other species. The pigment also improves visual contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions, and helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the <b>fish</b> <b>feed,</b> or other feeding birds. The red colouring reduces ultraviolet sensitivity, which in any case is an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls, and this protects the eye from UV damage.|$|E

5|$|Caprellamutica are {{omnivorous}} highly adaptable opportunistic feeders. Examinations {{of their}} stomach contents reveal a highly varied diet that {{depended on the}} particular substrate they are found on. They are predominantly detritivores, but have the remarkable ability of adjusting feeding methods from being grazers, scavengers, filter feeders, and even predators depending on the conditions of their environments. C.mutica sieve food particles or small organisms from the water by waving their bodies back and forth, with the comb-like setae on their second pair of antennae extended. They then clean off trapped particles by bending their antennae down to their mouthparts. They also use their antennae to scrape food particles from surfaces of their bodies or the substrate that they are clinging to. The large gnathopods are used for striking at and grasping both mobile and sessile prey. Known prey organisms of C.mutica include algae (both planktonic and macroalgae), dinoflagellates, hydrozoans, bryozoans, diatoms, copepods, brine shrimps, and other amphipods. They are capable of feeding on suspended organic particles, including <b>fish</b> <b>feed</b> and decaying organic matter. C.mutica are also known to engage in cannibalistic behavior on dead and dying individuals of their own species or genus.|$|E
5|$|The thick {{shell and}} rounded shape of {{bivalves}} make them awkward for potential predators to tackle. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} different creatures include them in their diet. Many species of demersal <b>fish</b> <b>feed</b> on them including the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is being used in the upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). Birds such as the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) have specially adapted beaks which can pry open their shells. The herring gull (Larus argentatus) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order to crack them open. Sea otters feed on a variety of bivalve species and have been observed to use stones balanced on their chests as anvils on which to crack open the shells. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) {{is one of the main}} predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters. Shellfish have formed part of the human diet since prehistoric times, a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens. Examinations of these deposits in Peru has provided a means of dating long past El Ni√±o events because of the disruption these caused to bivalve shell growth.|$|E

25|$|Forage fish, {{also called}} prey fish or bait fish, are small pelagic fish which are preyed on by larger predators for food. Predators include other larger fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Typical ocean forage <b>fish</b> <b>feed</b> {{near the base}} of the food chain on plankton, often by filter feeding. They include {{particularly}} fishes of the family Clupeidae (herrings, sardines, shad, hilsa, menhaden, anchovies and sprats), but also other small fish, including halfbeaks, silversides, smelt such as capelin, and the goldband fusiliers pictured on the right.|$|E
25|$|Most filter-feeding {{pelagic fish}} found in coastal waters are small, silvery forage fish. Forage fish include fishes {{of the family}} Clupeidae (herrings, shad, {{sardines}} and pilchards, hilsa, menhaden and sprats), as well as anchovies, capelin and halfbeaks. They use schooling strategies to avoid predators, and different schools of forage fish often associate {{with each other in}} open coastal waters. Forage <b>fish</b> <b>feed</b> near the base of the food chain on plankton and fry (recently hatched fish), often by filter feeding. In turn, they are preyed on by larger predatory fish, seabirds and marine mammals.|$|E
25|$|Biofilms can {{be found}} on rocks and pebbles at the bottom of most streams or rivers and often form on the surface of {{stagnant}} pools of water. Biofilms are important components of food chains in rivers and streams and are grazed by the aquatic invertebrates upon which many <b>fish</b> <b>feed.</b> Biofilms are found on the surface of and inside plants. They can either contribute to crop disease or, {{as in the case of}} nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium on roots, exist symbiotically with the plant. Examples of crop diseases related to biofilms include Citrus Canker, Pierce's Disease of grapes, and Bacterial Spot of plants such as peppers and tomatoes.|$|E
40|$|Efficient <b>fish</b> <b>feeding</b> is {{currently}} one of biggest challenges in aquaculture {{to enhance the}} production of fish quality and quantity. In this review, an information fusion approach was used to integrate multi-sensor and computer vision techniques to make <b>fish</b> <b>feeding</b> more efficient and accurate. Information fusion is a well-known technology {{that has been used}} in different fields of artificial intelligence, robotics, image processing, computer vision, sensors and wireless sensor networks. Information fusion in aquaculture is a growing field of research that is used to enhance the performance of an industrialized ecosystem. This review study surveys different <b>fish</b> <b>feeding</b> systems using multi-sensor data fusion, computer vision technology, and different food intake models. In addition, different fish behavior monitoring techniques are discussed, and the parameters of water, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, temperature etc., necessary for the <b>fish</b> <b>feeding</b> process, are examined. Moreover, the different waste management and fish disease diagnosis techniques using different technologies, expert systems and modeling are also reviewed...|$|R

25|$|The {{bar jack}} is a benthopelagic predator, taking its prey both in {{midwater}} {{and along the}} seafloor. The diet consists mostly of fish, up to 90% of the fishes intake in some studies, with planktonic crustaceans and small cephalopods taken in minor volumes. There is significant change in diet with age in fish studied off Cuba, which may reduce intraspecific competition in the species. Young fish prefer planktonic organisms, predominantly decapod and fish larvae; fish reaching sexual maturity prey on shrimp and small fish, while mature <b>fish</b> <b>feed</b> almost exclusively on small fish. The fish species preferred by bar jack appear to be mostly small sand dwellers such as blennies and gobies or small reef dwellers including wrasses, butterflyfish and filefish, with the diet of the latter leading to the accumulation of coral derived ciguatera toxin in the jack's flesh. Other lesser taken prey items include gastropods, nematodes and benthic algae {{as well as a}} range of crustaceans.|$|E
25|$|Work {{continues}} on substituting vegetable proteins and protein concentrates for fish meal in the salmonid diet. As of 2014, an enzymatic {{process can be}} used to lower the carbohydrate content of barley, making it a high-protein <b>fish</b> <b>feed</b> suitable for salmon. Many other substitutions for fish meal are known, and diets containing zero fish meal are possible. For example, a planned closed containment salmon fish farm in Scotland uses ragworms, algae and amino acids as feed. However, commercial economic animal diets are determined by least cost linear programming models that are effectively competing with similar models for chicken and pig feeds for the same feed ingredients and these models show that fish meal is more useful in aquatic diets than in chicken diets, where they can make the chickens taste like fish. Unfortunately, this substitution can result in lower levels of the highly valued omega-3 content in the farmed product. However, when vegetable oil is used in the growing diet as an energy source and a different finishing diet containing high omega-3 content fatty acids from either fish oil, algae oils or some vegetable oils are used a few months before harvest, this problem is eliminated.|$|E
500|$|Humans {{introduced}} fish {{into the}} lake in the 1930s for sport fishing, including rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoliecas). [...] Trout were last released into Castle Lake in 2008 by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife but recreational fish stocking has since ceased due to concern for other species [...] (i.e., threatened or endangered). The brook char was also originally stocked but now has become self-sustaining, and reproduces naturally in springs found {{on the eastern side}} of the lake. Golden shiner is a bait fish minnow that was likely placed in the lake by anglers who left their remaining bait behind in the lake. The <b>fish</b> <b>feed</b> on zooplankton and insects; the fish are then eaten by predators around the lake, especially osprey (Pandion haliaetus). Other birds in the area include bald eagle (Haliaectus leucoephalus), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), wood duck (Aix sponsa), belted kingfisher (Megaceryle alcyon), Steller's jay (Cyanocitta stellere), and sooty grouse (Dendragapus fuliginosus).|$|E

Concentrations of thirteen PBDEs in {{a large number of}} channel catfish and <b>fish</b> <b>feeds</b> collected from Hubei province of China were investigated in this study. A fast isotopic dilution GC-MS method was firstly developed to simultaneously determine thirteen PBDEs in channel cat-fish and <b>fish</b> <b>feeds</b> in this study, and especially for the first time PBDEs in <b>fish</b> <b>feeds.</b> Pressurized liquid extraction and multi-layer silica gel column chromatography cleanup were used, some im-portant steps and crucial parameters were modified and intensified compared with other litera-tures, and GC and MS conditions were optimized.
