40|$|Fifth-generation poly(propylene imine) dendrimers, {{modified}} with 64 apolar adamantyl groups, {{have been}} immobilized on cyclodextrin host monolayers (molecular printboards) on glass by supramolecular microcontact printing. The immobilized dendrimers retain their guest-binding properties and function as molecular boxes that can <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> fluorescent dye molecules from solution. Alternatively, {{part of the}} immobilized dendrimers <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> dye molecules by cross-microcontact printing while the remaining, empty dendrimers <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a different dye from solution, resulting in alternating patterns of dye molecules. In addition, we demonstrate that encapsulation of dyes in immobilized dendrimers is reversible: immobilized molecular boxes can <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a dye, emptied, and subsequently refilled with a different dye...|$|R
5|$|Rule 184 also models {{a form of}} {{deposition}} of particles onto an irregular surface, in which each local minimum of the surface <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a particle in each step.

5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bolliger & Mabillard roller {{coasters}} is the box-section track. The running rails {{are connected to}} a box-section spine, instead of the circular spine used by other manufacturers. When a train travels around a box-section track, it creates a distinctive roaring sound, which is unique to this style of track. However, on some Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters, such as Talon at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and Gatekeeper at Cedar Point the track <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> sand to reduce this noise.|$|E

30|$|The Deluxe Jaszczak phantom (model ECT/DLX/P) is a Plexiglas {{cylinder}} partially {{composed of}} cold rods (diameters 4.8 to 12.7  mm) and partially of six inserted hollow spheres. The main cylinder of 6060  mL <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a 5  kBq mL− 1 FDG solution. Four spheres (internal diameters 7.86, 12.43, 15.43, and 24.82  mm) <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a 15  kBq mL− 1 FDG solution.

5|$|A {{parabolic}} trough {{consists of a}} linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned right above {{the middle of the}} parabolic mirror and <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology. The SEGS plants in California and Acciona's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City, Nevada are representatives of this technology.|$|E
5|$|A solar balloon {{is a black}} balloon that <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> {{ordinary}} air. As sunlight shines on the balloon, the air {{inside is}} heated and expands causing an upward buoyancy force, much like an artificially heated hot air balloon. Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.|$|E
5|$|Coal mining {{takes place}} in the three mountainous regions at 45 {{distinct}} coal beds near Mesozoic basins. Over 62 million tons of other non-fuel resources, such as slate, kyanite, sand, or gravel, were also mined in Virginia in 2012. The state's carbonate rock <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> more than 4,000 caves, ten of which are open for tourism. 35 million years ago, a bolide impacted what is now eastern Virginia. The resulting crater may explain sinking and earthquakes in the region.|$|E

The temperature stays around 14 C throughout the year, and the caves are the warmest underground places in the Czech Republic.|$|R
5|$|Coursed mud {{construction}} {{is one of}} the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a wall, and allowed to dry. More mud is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until the wall is complete. With puddled mud, a hand-made mud form <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> wetter mud and allowed to dry.|$|E
5|$|Eliot's poetry <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> {{religious}} images {{beyond those}} common to Christianity: the Four Quartets brings in Hindu stories {{with a particular}} emphasis on the Bhagavad-Gita of the Mahabharata.

5|$|Ivan ends {{his story}} {{deep in thought}} as Vasilisa begins to cry and Lukerya looks on in pain. He parts with the widows and {{continues}} homeward, thinking that his story troubled Lukerya and made Vasilisa weep not because he told it well but because the tale was relevant to them nineteen centuries later. As he rides the ferry to his village, Ivan comes to believe that truth and beauty serve as the connectors of all human history and he <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> joy and awe at life itself.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1950s, KLM {{presents}} its World Business Class passengers with a Delft blue, miniature, traditional, Dutch house.

50|$|Experiments and {{mathematical}} models show {{that more of}} a given volume can <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> hard spheres if it <b>is</b> first <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> large spheres, then the spaces between (interstices) <b>are</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> smaller spheres, and the new interstices <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> still smaller spheres {{as many times as}} possible. For this reason, control of particle size distribution can be quite important in the choice of aggregate; appropriate simulations or experiments are necessary to determine the optimal proportions of different-sized particles.|$|R

5|$|Stargazy pie is a pastry-based fish pie which, by tradition, <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> whole pilchards. Critically, the pilchards must {{retain their}} heads, which then poke through the pastry top, {{appearing}} {{to gaze at}} the stars. The position of the fish allows the oil that is released during cooking to drain into the pie, adding a fuller flavour and ensuring the pie is moist. The celebrity chef Rick Stein suggested also poking the pilchards' tails through the pie crust to give the effect of leaping through water.|$|E
5|$|The avian {{circulatory system}} {{is driven by}} a four-chambered, myogenic heart {{contained}} in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac <b>is</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.|$|E

5|$|The choir is {{entered through}} a screen {{designed}} by George Gilbert Scott, with gates made by Skidmore. The rood {{was designed by}} Scott, and was made by F.Stuflesser. The bishop’s throne or “cathedra” was designed by Scott to complement the choir stalls. It was constructed by Farmer and Brindley in 1876. The reredos and the floor mosaic date from 1876, and were designed by J.R.Clayton.

Puzzles do not all have to be completed in a precise order; there is some flexibility in terms of being able to move through game areas and work on different challenges.|$|E
