5|$|A highsider, highside, or {{high side}} {{is a type of}} bike motion which is caused by a rear wheel gaining {{traction}} when it is not <b>facing</b> <b>in</b> the direction of travel, usually after slipping sideways in a curve. This can occur under heavy braking, acceleration, a varying road surface, or suspension activation, especially due to interaction with the drive train. It can {{take the form of a}} single slip-then-flip or a series of violent oscillations.|$|E
5|$|Stela 12 {{is located}} near Structure11. It is badly damaged, having been broken into {{fragment}}s, of which two remain. The largest fragment {{is from the}} lower portion of the stela and depicts the legs and feet of a figure, both <b>facing</b> <b>in</b> the same direction. They stand upon a panel divided into geometric sections, each containing a further design. In front of the legs are {{the remains of a}} glyph that appears to be a number in the bar-and-dot format. A smaller fragment lies nearby.|$|E
5|$|Like other crustaceans, malacostracans {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} in which the heart pumps blood into the hemocoel (body cavity) where it {{supplies}} the needs of the organs for oxygen and nutrients before diffusing back to the heart. The typical respiratory pigment in malacostracans is haemocyanin. Structures that function as kidneys are located near the base of the antennae. A brain exists in the form of ganglia close to the antennae, there are ganglia in each segment and a collection of major ganglia below the oesophagus. Sensory organs include compound eyes (often stalked), ocelli (simple eyes), statocysts and sensory bristles. The naupliar eye is a characteristic of the nauplius larva and consists of four cup-shaped ocelli <b>facing</b> <b>in</b> different directions and able to distinguish between light and darkness.|$|E

50|$|Spherical polyhedra without central {{symmetry}} do {{not define}} a projective polyhedron, as {{the images of}} vertices, edges, and <b>faces</b> will overlap. <b>In</b> the language of tilings, the image in the projective plane is a degree 2 tiling, meaning that it covers the projective plane twice - rather than 2 <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> the sphere corresponding to 1 <b>face</b> <b>in</b> the projective plane, covering it twice, each <b>face</b> <b>in</b> the sphere corresponds to a single <b>face</b> <b>in</b> the projective plane, accordingly covering it twice.|$|R
5|$|The Times {{sold the}} {{building}} to advertising executive and sign designer Douglas Leigh in 1961. Leigh then sold {{the building to}} Allied Chemical in 1963. Allied Chemical greatly modified the building's facade in a $10 million renovation, replacing intricate granite and terracotta elements with marble <b>facing.</b> <b>In</b> 1974, the building was sold to investor Alex Parker for $6.25 million, {{and then to the}} Swiss-based investment group Kemekod. Kemekod later sold the tower to an investment group led by Lawrence I. Linksman in 1982. Linksman promised further renovations to the building, including the possibility of using its north face for signage displays.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{had to make}} a choice: {{he could}} launch an attack and fight through the Confederate rear to reach Grant's forces closer to Pittsburg Landing, or reverse his {{direction}} and march toward Pittsburg Landing via a crossroads to the River Road. Wallace chose the second option. (After the war, Wallace claimed that his division might have attacked and defeated the Confederates if his advance had not been interrupted, but later conceded that the move would not have been successful.) Rather than realign his troops so the rear guard would be in the front, Wallace made a controversial decision to countermarch his troops to maintain the original order, only <b>facing</b> <b>in</b> the other direction. The move further delayed Wallace's troops as they marched north along the Shunpike road, then took a crossover to reach the River Road to the east, and headed south toward the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{stage is}} usually short, its {{function}} only to mate and lay eggs. The genitalia of female flies are rotated to a varying {{degree from the}} position found in other insects. In some flies, this is a temporary rotation during mating, but in others, it is a permanent torsion of the organs that occurs during the pupal stage. This torsion {{may lead to the}} anus being below the genitals, or, in the case of 360° torsion, to the sperm duct being wrapped around the gut and the external organs being in their usual position. When flies mate, the male initially flies on top of the female, <b>facing</b> <b>in</b> the same direction, but then turns around to face in the opposite direction. This forces the male to lie on his back for his genitalia to remain engaged with those of the female, or the torsion of the male genitals allows the male to mate while remaining upright. This leads to flies having more reproduction abilities than most insects, and much quicker. Flies occur in large populations due to their ability to mate effectively and quickly during the mating season.|$|E

5|$|The race's first caution was necessitated on {{the same}} lap when Papis spun on the frontstretch, and slid {{backwards}} towards the first corner before getting his car <b>facing</b> <b>in</b> the racing direction. Vasser made contact with Tora Takagi who was sent into the frontstretch barrier. Bruno Junqueira and Memo Gidley spun in avoidance; the latter regained control of his car while Junqueira collided with the outside wall, causing him to become the race's first retirement. Max Wilson spun while gaining optimum tyre temperature {{and fell to the}} rear of the field. The race restarted on the ninth lap with de Ferran leading Bräck and Andretti. Bräck was held up by Wilson on the 23rd lap allowing de Ferran to establish a two-second lead over him. Wilson received a warning from the series' race control. Castroneves was passed by Franchitti for the fourth position seven laps later. Christian Fittipaldi attempted to lap Gidley on lap 37, but the latter drove defensively causing Fittipaldi to reduce his speed, and he was overtaken by Vasser, Adrián Fernández, and Carpentier.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} the {{television}} appearance, on 11 February 1964, the Beatles' first U.S. concert took place, at Washington Coliseum, a sports arena in Washington, D.C. The concert was attended by eight thousand fans. The Beatles performed on a central stage in the arena, with the audience on all sides, and there were regular pauses to enable the band to turn their equipment around and perform <b>facing</b> <b>in</b> another direction. The concert generated intense excitement. The following day, the Beatles performed a second concert, in Carnegie Hall, New York, which was attended by two thousand fans. The concert was again well received. Following the Carnegie Hall concert, the Beatles flew to Miami Beach and on Sunday 16 February 1964 made their second television appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, which this time was broadcast live from the Napoleon Ballroom of the Deauville Hotel in Miami Beach. As it had done on 9 February, the television broadcast attracted around 70million viewers. On 22 February 1964, the Beatles returned to the UK. Arriving at Heathrow airport at 7 am, they were met by an estimated ten thousand fans.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} whether {{the detection of}} frontal, ¾, and profile face views differs from their categorization as <b>faces.</b> <b>In</b> Experiment 1, we compared three tasks that required observers to determine {{the presence or absence}} of a <b>face,</b> but varied <b>in</b> the extents to which participants had to search for the <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> simple displays and in small or large scenes to make this decision. Performance was equivalent for all of the <b>face</b> views <b>in</b> simple displays and small scenes, but it was notably slower for profile views when this required the search for <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> extended scene displays. This search effect was confirmed in Experiment 2, in which we compared observers’ eye movements with their response times to <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> visual scenes. These results demonstrate that the categorization of faces at fixation is dissociable from the detection of <b>faces</b> <b>in</b> space. Consequently, we suggest that face detection should be studied with extended visual displays, such as natural scenes...|$|R

25|$|It was {{especially}} {{during this time}} that African Americans began forming their own churches, {{in part because of}} the unequal treatment they were <b>facing</b> <b>in</b> integrated churches in both the North and the South.
