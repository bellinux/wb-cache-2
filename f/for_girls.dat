The Norton Knatchbull School {{was founded in}} Ashford around 1630 as a free grammar school by its namesake, Sir Norton Knatchbull.

The original school was based next to {{the church in the}} town centre, but has moved several times. By the 20th century it had moved to its present location on Hythe Road. The current school premises were built in the late 1990s. The corresponding grammar school <b>for</b> <b>girls</b> is Highworth Grammar School <b>for</b> <b>Girls</b> to the west of town.

5|$|Childhood {{was brief}} and perilous, {{even more so}} <b>for</b> <b>girls</b> than boys. Parents would {{celebrate}} {{the birth of a}} boy twice as much and there is some evidence of female infanticide (i.e. roadside abandonment and suffocation), though it was contrary to both civil and canon law. Educational opportunities <b>for</b> <b>girls</b> were few: they did not attend regular schools but were taught in groups at home by tutors. With few exceptions, education was limited to literacy and the Bible; a famous exception is the princess Anna Komnene (1083–1153), whose Alexiad displays a great depth of erudition, and the renowned 9th century Byzantine poet and composer Kassiani. The majority of a young girl's daily life would be spent in household and agrarian chores, preparing herself for marriage.|$|E

She said that it was a woman's religious duty to educate herself. She urged women to take advantage of public resources like libraries and museums, or if time did not permit, to enlarge their minds at Relief Society meetings.|$|E
