5|$|In 1966, {{an article}} was {{published}} about the bell's submersion and resurfacing at Geneva Lake. The article interested {{the people of}} Mount Morris, Illinois, and they sent 12 members of their Fourth of July Committee to investigate the bell in Johnsburg. The people of Mount Morris decided to purchase the bell; a committee was formed and obtained a loan from the Mount Morris VFW. The group also collected donations from local residents to purchase the bell for US$500. By July 4, 1966, the Illinois Freedom Bell hung from the <b>gazebo</b> in its current location, and the two writers who first suggested bell ringing as an annual Independence Day ceremony, Eric Hatch and Eric Sloane were on hand for its dedication.|$|E
5|$|Northup begins {{working on}} the {{construction}} of a <b>gazebo</b> with a Canadian laborer named Samuel Bass (Brad Pitt). Bass is unsettled by the brutal way that Epps treats his slaves and expresses his opposition to American slavery, earning Epps's enmity. Solomon overhears the conversation and decides to reveal his kidnapping to Bass. Once again, Northup asks for help in getting a letter to Saratoga Springs. Bass, risking his life, agrees to send it. One day, the local sheriff arrives in a carriage with another man. The sheriff asks Northup a series of questions to confirm that his answers match the facts of his life in New York. Northup recognizes the sheriff's companion as Mr. Parker, a shopkeeper he knew in Saratoga. Parker has come to free him, and the two embrace, though an enraged Epps furiously protests the circumstances and tries to prevent him from leaving. Solomon gives an emotional farewell to Patsey and rides off to his freedom. Patsey faints as Solomon leaves.|$|E

5|$|The French {{military}} invaded Antananarivo in September 1894, {{prompting the}} queen's surrender after a cannon shell blasted {{a hole through}} a building at the Rova, causing major casualties. The damage was never repaired. Andohalo square was remodeled to feature a <b>gazebo,</b> walkways and planted landscaping. Claiming the island as a colony, the French administration retained Antananarivo as its capital and transcribed its name as Tananarive. They chose Antaninarenina as {{the site for the}} French Governor General's Residency; upon independence it was renamed Ambohitsorohitra Palace and converted into presidential offices. Under the French, tunnels were constructed through two of the city's largest hills, connecting disparate districts and facilitating the town's expansion. Streets were laid with cobblestones and later paved; sewer systems and electricity infrastructure were introduced. Water, previously obtained from springs {{at the foot of the}} hill, was brought from the Ikopa River.|$|E
5|$|The Illinois Freedom Bell {{is located}} in Mount Morris, Illinois, United States, and is the {{official}} freedom bell of the U.S. state of Illinois. The bell was created for a church in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin as {{a replica of the}} Liberty Bell in 1862. In 1910, while it was being moved across the frozen Geneva Lake following a fire at the church, the ice cracked and the bell sank {{to the bottom of the}} lake. It was salvaged in 1960 and the village of Mount Morris acquired it in 1966. The Illinois Freedom Bell is rung during the annual Let Freedom Ring festival, and it can be found beneath a <b>gazebo</b> on the village square. The bell has been credited with starting an Independence Day bell-ringing tradition across the United States. The bell was designated the official Illinois Freedom Bell in 1971.|$|E

The second clip, which lasted one minute, features several more of Ron Swanson's meetings, including one where he tries to literally will a man away with his mind. Andy also tells Ron he accidentally agreed to sell the recreation center to the Quiznos fast food restaurant chain. In the third, 90-second clip, Leslie tries to end Nick Newport Sr.'s birthday party by pulling the plug on the lights, but accidentally disconnects his breathing machine instead.|$|E
