60|$|How {{kind you}} are, far too kind, about the Cyprus wine; <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "A good-looking wife," [...] {{the visitor}} remarked, thoughtfully. [...] "But, yes! <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> Mr. Courtledge for showing me round. I will find my friends now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "G--gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "I must be off. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> for this--hospitality. Honoured, I'm sure, to {{have sat}} down in such--such company. Good afternoon, all!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{exceedingly}} obliging, Sir Leicester, and {{on behalf}} of those ladies (who are present) and for myself, <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} thankful indeed, Prince, {{if you can}} persuade them to fix on this mode of {{execution}} for me; and <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> gratefully, Princess, for suggesting it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah then--so {{much the}} better! From the moment I HAD {{received}} it I knew I must {{sooner or later}} speak of it--for that, you see, is, systematically, my way. And now," [...] Charlotte added, [...] "you make me glad I've spoken. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Madame Laurin," [...] said Grandmother Marshall with {{a gracious}} dignity, [...] "but I am quite {{able to give}} my granddaughter all the {{necessary}} advantages {{for the development of}} her gift. And <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> for telling me of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I can {{sit down}} for a few minutes," [...] she said in her pretty foreign accent, [...] "I shall soon be myself again, and I shall not {{trespass}} any further on your kindness. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> sir, for taking care of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'With submission, my soul,' pleaded Mr Sparkler. 'I know I have a {{habit of}} it, and <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> my adorable girl, for taking the trouble to correct it; but my mother is {{admitted}} on all sides to be a remarkably fine woman, and she really hasn't any.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Home, please uncle; and <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> {{very much}} for the {{beautiful}} firework you got up for me. I'm so glad I saw it; and I know I shall dream about it," [...] answered Rose steadily, though a wistful glance went toward the Island, now so near that she could smell powder and see shadowy figures flitting about.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir, <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> indeed. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> gratefully. It {{was told}} {{me by the}} Bank that the gentleman would explain to me {{the details of the}} business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a {{surprising}} nature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So soon!' said Stagg, meekly. 'But it can't be helped. Cheer up, friend. This mistake {{will soon}} be set at rest, and then you are a man again! If this {{charitable}} gentleman will lead a blind man (who has nothing in return but prayers) to the prison-porch, and set him with his face towards the west, he will do a worthy deed. <b>Thank</b> <b>you,</b> good sir. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> kindly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you!" [...] {{said the}} girl. [...] "That {{was not what}} I asked you. I know what my father meant to do, and I didn't need any reassurance. I'm sorry to have troubled you with all these {{irrelevant}} questions; and <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> for the kind advice you have given me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no feeling}} of {{kindness}} towards you, Mr. Pratt," [...] she said, [...] "and I hate hypocrisy. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> for your luncheon. You will forgive my shaking hands, won't you? It was scarcely in the bargain. And I must say good-by now. I am due {{back at the}} office at half-past two." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{say nothing}} of your own share {{in the making of}} that happiness, John; but we know it, for Philip has told Laura in his letters all that you have been to him, and I am sure there was other eloquence beside his own before father granted all you say he has. Oh, John, <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> for this!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You did quite right,' he said, {{at the end}} of a long conversation, 'to bid them {{keep this}} story secret. It is a foolish fancy on the part of this weak-brained man, bred in his fears and superstition. But Miss Haredale, though she would know it to be so, would be {{disturbed}} by it if it reached her ears; it is too nearly connected with a subject very painful to us all, to be heard with indifference. You were most prudent, and have laid me under a great obligation. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> much.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not {{wonder at}} that," [...] I responded, [...] "and I cannot {{blame you for}} {{demanding}} a rest. No one could have endured more uncomplainingly. You have been a model subject, and we are deeply in your debt. I am sorry Miller was not with us to-night; {{he would have been}} convinced of your supernormal power at least. Have no fear of my report; for while I am not convinced of the spirit hypothesis, I have found you honest and patient and <b>very</b> brave. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> sincerely for what you have done." ...|$|R
60|$|HECTOR. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you,</b> too. It's <b>very</b> kind of <b>you.</b> My {{father knows}} no better.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{for meaning}} {{to bring my}} goods for me. I wish I could have seen your {{pictures}} before they took to themselves golden wings and fled away. Is it true, really, that you think to exhibit in London Penini's portrait at the piano, as Sophie Eckley tells me? I shall like to hear that you succeed in that.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Matt, [...] "that I could justify {{myself in}} hurting {{him on that}} ground. I shall be careful about him. I don't at all know that I shall want to use it; but it has just struck me that perhaps--But I don't know! I should have to talk with their attorney--I will see about it! And <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> Mr. Maxwell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I admit," [...] I answered, {{although}} I {{was trembling}} {{so much that}} I could hardly speak with steadiness, [...] "that a woman may be splendid and lovely beyond anything that the mind of man can conceive, whatever her age, of which I know nothing. I would add this, Ayesha, that <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> for having revealed to me the glory that is hid beneath your veil." ...|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT [beaming candidatorially]. <b>I</b> must <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> particularly, Mr Haffigan, {{for your}} support this morning. I value it because I know that the real heart of a nation is the class you represent, the yeomanry.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I haven't the strength, to mean anything," [...] she said. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you,</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> much," [...] she added. She {{turned her}} head away.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> heartily {{for your}} letter, {{and for the}} {{seriousness}} you brought to it. You know, I think when a serious thing is your own, you keep a saner man by laughing at it and yourself as you go. So I do not write possibly with all the really somewhat sickened gravity I feel. And indeed, what with the book, and this business to which I referred, and Ireland, I am scarcely in an enviable state. Well, I ought to be glad, after ten years of the worst training on earth--valetudinarianism--that I can still be troubled by a duty. You shall hear more in time; so far, I am at least decided: I will go and see Balfour when I get to London.|$|R
60|$|MR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN,--I do {{not know}} how to thank you {{sufficiently}} for this high honor which you are conferring upon me. I have for the second time now enjoyed this kind of prodigal hospitality--in the other House yesterday, to-day in this one. I am a modest man, and diffident about appearing before legislative bodies, and yet utterly an entirely appreciative of a courtesy like this when it is extended to me, and <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> for it.|$|E
6000|$|DEAR JOE,--You are mistaken; people don't send us the magazines. No--Harper, Century and McClure do; {{an example}} I {{should like to}} {{recommend}} to other publishers. And so <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> for sending me Brander's article. When you say [...] "I like Brander Matthews; he impresses me {{as a man of}} parts and power," [...] I back you, right up to the hub--I feel the same way--. And when you say he has earned your gratitude for cuffing me for my crimes against the Leather stockings and the Vicar, I ain't making any objection. Dern your gratitude! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I mean,' said Mr Toots, 'that I shall {{consider}} it my {{duty as a}} fellow-creature generally, until I am claimed by the silent tomb, {{to make the best}} of myself, and to--to have my boots as brightly polished, as--as--circumstances will admit of. This is the last time, Miss Dombey, of my intruding any observation of a private and personal nature. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> indeed. If I am not, in a general way, as sensible as my friends could wish me to be, or as I could wish myself, I really am, upon my word and honour, particularly sensible of what is considerate and kind. I feel,' said Mr Toots, in an impassioned tone, 'as if I could express my feelings, at the present moment, in a most remarkable manner, if--if--I could only get a start.' ...|$|E
6000|$|FRANKLYN [to Lubin] Are you {{prepared}} to listen, Mr Lubin; or shall <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> for your <b>very</b> kind and welcome visit, and say good evening? ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> heartily {{for your}} letter, {{and for the}} {{seriousness}} you brought to it. You know, I think when a serious thing is your own, you keep a saner man by laughing at it and yourself as you go. [...] So I do not write possibly with all the really somewhat sickened gravity I feel.

6000|$|Waiving your obliging {{expressions}} as {{to my own}} productions, {{for which}} <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> sincerely, and assure you that I think not lightly of the praise of one whose approbation is valuable, will you allow {{me to talk to}} you candidly, not critically, on the subject of yours? You will not suspect me of a wish to discourage, since I pointed out to the publisher the propriety of complying with your wishes. I think more highly of your poetical talents than it would, perhaps, gratify you to hear expressed, for I believe, from what I observe of your mind, that you are above flattery. To come to the point, you deserve success, but we know, before Addison wrote his Cato', that desert does not always command it. But, suppose it attained: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{and your}} master have saved my life, have you?" [...] he said. [...] "Well, neighbour, {{why did you}} try to save my life by {{shooting}} at me with that great black bow of yours, which I see is made of Eastern woods?" [...] He stared at the case in which it was now again hidden as though tanned leather were no obstacle to his sight; then went on: [...] "Do not answer: I will tell you why. You shot at me because you were afraid of me, and fear is ever cruel, is it not? Only something happened to your arrow, something that has never happened to any arrow of yours before. Oh, yes, you have saved me from the Italian cut-throats, and being a gentleman <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> Only why did the arrow burst in your bow?" [...] and he smiled with those dreadful eyes of his.|$|E
6000|$|... "O Lord," [...] he said, [...] "forgive me all my sins, {{which are}} too many to count, or at least I haven't the time to try, and {{especially}} for cutting off {{the head of the}} executioner with his own sword, although I had no death quarrel with him, and for killing a Spaniard in a boxing match. O Lord, <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> because you have arranged for us to die fighting instead of being tortured and burnt in the gaol, and I pray that {{we may be able to}} kill enough Spaniards first to make them remember us for years to come. O Lord, protect my dear master and mistress, and let the former learn that we have made an end of which he would approve, but if may be, hide it from the Paster Arentz, who might think that we ought to surrender. That is all I have to say. Amen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'MY DEAR PHILIP,--Thank {{you much}} for writing to me. It {{was a great}} comfort to see your writing again, and to hear of your being safe in our own country. We had been very anxious about you, though we did not hear of your illness till the worst was over. I am very glad you are at St. Mildred's, for I am sure Margaret must be very careful of you, and Stylehurst air must be good for you. Every one here is well; Charles growing almost active, and looking better than I ever saw him. I wish I could tell you how nice and quiet a winter it has been; {{it has been a}} great blessing to me in every way, so many things have come to me to enjoy. Mr. Ross has come to me every Sunday, and often in the week, and has been so very kind. I think talking to him will be a great {{pleasure}} to you when you are here again. You will like to hear that Mr. Shene has sent me the picture, and the pleasure it gives me increases every day. Indeed, I am so well off in every way, that you must not grieve yourself about me, though <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> for what you say. Laura reads to me all the evening from dinner to tea. I am much better than I was in the winter, and am enjoying the soft spring air from the open window, making it seem as if it was much later in the year. 'Good-bye, my dear cousin; may God bless and comfort you. Remember, that after all, it was God's will, not your doing; and therefore, as he said himself, all is as it should be, and so it will surely be.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Spike, <b>I</b> am not, <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> {{much for}} inquiring. I'm {{never going to}} touch a jewel again unless I've paid for it and got the receipt in my pocket." ...|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} a very great benefit to me that we drifted into {{collaboration}} largely in its beginning as an accident-when you pointed out my mistake over the webs of Drong's tail feather-and the mistake has proved to me well worth while. And here and now <b>I</b> must <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> warmly for making my collaboration a condition of your undertaking the Mysore and Sunderbans surveys.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{good of you}} {{to bring}} me these! They are more {{refreshing}} than oceans of tea. You know what <b>I</b> like, Jack; <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>very</b> much" [...] cried Kitty, sniffing at her roses with grateful rapture.|$|R
