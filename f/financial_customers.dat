40|$|This paper {{examines}} the behaviour of end-user order flows {{in the foreign}} exchange market around periods of intense and large-scale intervention activity by the Bank of Japan. First, we find very limited evidence that corporate customers are affected in the desired way by intervention. However, there is somewhat stronger evidence that profit maximising <b>financial</b> <b>customers</b> are adversely affected. Second, using a regression framework we again find evidence that corporate customers react in ways consistent {{with the intentions of}} the Bank of Japan, while <b>financial</b> <b>customers</b> act in the opposite way. The aggregate impact of intervention to buy the dollar is, if anything, to increase net purchases of the yen by the customers of the bank we analyse. Finally, we find very clear evidence that intervention matters in a microstructure analysis. The strong contemporaneous correlation between order flows and exchange rate changes observed in many studies essentially disappears on days in which the Bank of Japan intervenes...|$|E

40|$|Using {{a unique}} dataset that covers 100 % of the Brazilian FX retail market, this paper {{contributes}} to the microstructure approach to exchange rates in at least four ways. First, we find a strict link between currency flows in the FX market and the Balance of Payments. Second, we develop an identication strategy in order to properly estimate the effect of customer order fl?ows on the exchange rate and ?find that dealers from the Brazilian FX market charge a premium of 0. 03 % {{in order to provide}} US$ 10 million of overnight liquidity. Third, we identify the nature of the feedback trading as "stabilizing"?: a 1 % depreciation rate decreases the <b>financial</b> <b>customer</b> fl?ow by US$ 111 million and the commercial fl?ow by US$ 46 million. Finally, we find that the central bank sells in average US$ 28 million for each 1 % depreciation in the exchange rate (lean-against-the-wind), and US$ 23 million for US$ 100 million of <b>financial</b> <b>customer</b> flow (liquidity provision) ...|$|R

Evidence {{presented in this article}} suggests that Canadian dealers are more likely to provide interday liquidity to foreign, rather than Canadian, <b>financial</b> <b>customers,</b> since foreign financial flows can be more informative about future movements in the exchange rate. The author reveals a statistical relationship between the supply of liquidity provided by non-financial firms and that provided by dealing institutions across time, and across markets, and suggests that the relationship between the positions of commercial clients and market-makers, and the role played by dealers in interday liquidity provision, has been understated in the market microstructure literature. ...|$|E

Analyzing four months of a bank’s high frequency US dollar-euro trading, three different kinds of order flow are used in addition to seasonal patterns in explaining volatility. We find that only larger sized order flows from <b>financial</b> <b>customers</b> and banks – indicating informed trading – contribute to explaining volatility, whereas flows from commercial customers do not. The result is robust when we control for news and other measures of market activity. This strengthens the view that exchange rate volatility reflects information processing. exchange rate, market microstructure, order flow, financial customer orders, volatility patterns...|$|E
