40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>innovation</b> radically {{transforms}} {{the nature of}} corporate innovation practices, implying a growing need for deeper understanding its origins and outcomes. In this paper, we conceptualize the focal points of social networking in <b>digital</b> <b>innovation</b> as idea <b>hubs.</b> We focus our analysis on instances of idea hubs in two multinational European software companies, where we conducted a case study over a two-year period, and collected data in form of interviews, digital documents, and participant observations. In doing so, we identify a set of social networking practices in which idea hubs serve as nexus of collective creativity and subject these to a critical dialectical examination. We discuss three influencing factors of idea hub choice, namely material infrastructure, innovation process phase, and personal characteristics. These explain why in a corporate environment, despite a variety of digital artifacts individuals can choose from, offline interaction still {{plays a major role}} in facilitating <b>digital</b> <b>innovation...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>innovation</b> <b>hubs</b> are {{increasingly}} being adopted by different sectors {{as a means to}} accelerate innovation. Previous research on <b>innovation</b> <b>hubs</b> have focused on large-scale and trans-regional hubs on its managerial practices instead of its geographical situation. This paper studies an <b>innovation</b> <b>hub</b> in the Northern Swedish city of Skellefteå, in a region historically relying on heavy industry trying to transform into a high technology economy. The study aims to answer the research question: “what are the challenges and opportunities in building and managing an <b>innovation</b> <b>hub</b> to foster <b>innovation</b> in a geographically isolated region with a relatively small population?” To answer this question, interviews with stakeholders in the <b>innovation</b> <b>hub</b> has been conducted as part of a qualitative case study. The results indicate that the region’s large heavy industry companies provide a fertile ecosystem for startups in the digital industry by enabling the necessary supporting industries and infrastructure. Meanwhile, the lack of certain important elements needed in the startup process, most prominently private funding in the form of angel investors and venture capital, pose challenges {{to the development of the}} digital startup community in the region...|$|R

40|$|Part 4 : Social Mechanisms of ICT-Enabled DevelopmentInternational audienceThe rapid {{expansion}} of hundreds of <b>innovation</b> <b>hubs</b> across Africa and Europe raises compelling questions about the relevance of this dynamic sector for development. To address this, our paper presents findings of how {{the social and economic}} context of hubs influences its members’ construction of concepts of community, collaboration and development. The paper argues that what counts as innovation is often constructed in Western discourse and projected onto African realities. Doreen Massey’s theory of space-making is used as a lens to analyse how different hubs produce distinct forms of collaboration and innovation for development. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore alternative narratives of <b>innovation</b> <b>hubs</b> through a spatial perspective with the aim of revealing a multiplicity of forms for these hubs. It draws on findings from two <b>innovation</b> <b>hubs</b> in London and Lusaka respectively, using the methodology of multiple case studies. This article thus contributes firstly to the so far very limited empirical data on <b>innovation</b> <b>hubs,</b> and second, strengthens the theoretical framings of innovation for development which have so far emanated from a Western- centric empirical evidence base...|$|R

40|$|Digitization of {{analogue}} everyday artifacts, i. e. when physical {{products are}} equipped with digital capabilities, has {{a profound impact on}} today’s society. Some examples of these <b>digital</b> <b>innovations</b> aimed at consumer markets are the “connected” car, the digitized television set, and in the near future, digitized IKEA furniture. <b>Digital</b> <b>innovation</b> provides endless opportunities for providing value adding products and services. However, in <b>digital</b> <b>innovation</b> {{there is a need to}} find new ways of organizing network activities, i. e. activities such as e. g. production and translation of knowledge and enrollment of actors. These activities need to embrace and build on the networked aspects and the complexity inherent to <b>digital</b> <b>innovation.</b> This requires network activities that can overcome challenges with the ambiguous and messy characteristics of <b>digital</b> <b>innovation.</b> In this thesis, I propose that the theoretical perspective of network orchestration can enlighten fruitful ways to address challenges that are encountered when organizing network activities in <b>digital</b> <b>innovation.</b> Inspired by practical challenges with <b>digital</b> <b>innovation,</b> as well as contemporary calls for research within IS, this thesis investigates: How can network activities be orchestrated in <b>digital</b> <b>innovation?</b> Two cases of <b>digital</b> <b>innovation</b> aimed at consumer markets are studied. The first case concerns the digitization of the newspaper. The second case regards the digitization of door locks. Literature about <b>digital</b> <b>innovation</b> is used to understand the context of the studied phenomenon. Furthermore, theories about network orchestration as well as activities in innovation are used as a theoretical framework to help answer the research question. The thesis is based on an interpretative perspective where a multi-method approach has been applied to address the research question. The contribution is divided into two different parts. The first part presents four categories of empirically derived network activities that address socio-technical challenges with organizing <b>digital</b> <b>innovation.</b> The second part is a proposed model detailing orchestration of network activities in <b>digital</b> <b>innovation.</b> The model is based around the four suggested categories of network activities: (1) Supporting flexible innovation networks, (2) Production and translation of layered architectural knowledge, (3) Addressing heterogeneous user communities, and (4) Harnessing generativity to leverage value. The categories of network activities can be viewed as building blocks for the orchestration process. By emphasizing both a proactive and a reactive way of orchestrating <b>digital</b> <b>innovation,</b> the model proposes a means for organizations to address the ambiguity and complexity of <b>digital</b> <b>innovation...</b>|$|R
