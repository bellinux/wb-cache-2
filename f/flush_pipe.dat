40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes an}} experimental exploration of structural and mixing {{characteristics of the}} unforced as well as forced jet in crossflow (JICF). For unforced experiments, variable jet-to-crossflow density ratios (0. 35 ≤S≤ 1. 00) and momentum flux ratios (5 ≤J≤ 41) were explored, for three alternative injectors with a fixed jet Reynolds number (Rej= 1900). For forced jet experiments, an equidensity jet emanating from two alternative flush nozzles (Rej= 1900; Rej= 1500) were explored. The interplay between scalar and velocity fields for the JICF was studied using simultaneous PLIF/stereo PIV measurements in the jet’s centerplane. POD analysis showed a transition from convective to absolutely instability in the upstream shear layer as J was reduced, consistent with hotwire measurements. Local strain rates were extracted from both PLIF and PIV data via the Howarth transformation. Mixing characterization with variable mixing scale lengths was explored via centerplane PLIF images. Mixing associated with stirring as well as molecular mixing could be distinguished, apparent especially in vortical structures for <b>flush</b> <b>pipe</b> injection. Sinusoidal forcing of the convectively unstable JICF demonstrated that relatively low amplitude forcing affected jet structures and mixing, especially close to the fundamental frequency. For the absolutely unstable JICF, a much higher forcing amplitude was required to alter jet characteristics, consistent with lock-in, leading to enhanced molecular mixing. Single-pulse square wave forcing created deeply-penetrating vortical structures for specific stroke ratios (L/D), even for the absolutely unstable JICF. L/D producing the greatest jet spread and penetration decreased with decreasing J, but L/D for optimal molecular mixing corresponded to different values and trends in J. Double-pulse square wave excitation, with two variable pulses within each temporal period, enabled the jet's nearfield vortex rings to interact and collide, with attendant effect on molecular mixing...|$|E

50|$|Soon after completion, sediment-accumulation {{threatened}} {{the benefits of}} the dam. The Yellow River carries more sediment than any other in the world. During the 18 months after the river was closed, 1.8 billion metric tons of sediment had accumulated in the reservoir. Only 7% of the sediment-load was released downstream and the reservoir lost 17% of its capacity below a 335 m ASL elevation. Navigation and farmland were threatened upstream along with the relocation of an additional one million people. Despite the dam's 12 deep-sluices and alterations in the release of water, silt continued to build in the reservoir, particularly in the back waters. Responding to the potential crisis, a meeting was held in December 1964 with Premier Zhou Enlai. At the meeting, it was decided to reconstruct the dam's outlet works for improved discharges and silt control. The renovation was carried out immediately and in two stages. The first stage included the installation of two tunnels on the dam's left bank at an elevation of 290 m ASL along with converting four penstocks into <b>flushing</b> <b>pipes.</b> The <b>flushing</b> <b>pipes</b> began operating in 1966 and the tunnels in 1967 and 1968. In the second stage, eight bottom sluices were added to {{the left side of the}} dam which became operational between 1970 and 1971. Silt balance was achieved in 1970. Two more bottom sluices began operating in 1990 along with another in 1999 and the final in 2000.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the work is to {{determine}} how high are the concentrations of lead in drinking water in older Slovenian kindergartens and primary schools and to demonstrate that lead can also migrate from newer materials used for the construction of water distribution networks. To determine the concentrations of lead in drinking water, it is needed to take 250 ml of drinking water that stood in the pipes from 8 to 18 hours. It is also applied a method for determining the migration from different materials. An old lead pipe is utilized, as well as new materials (PEX-Al-PEX, copper, galvanized pipes and stainless steel pipes). Sampling showed that 6 samples of 39 had levels of lead higher than 10 gl, two of them highly exceeded that level. Negative correlation between the level of pH and concentration of lead in drinking water is moderate. Implementation of lead migration from various types of pipes demonstrated the migration from galvanized pipes in all simulants. Furthermore, the migration of lead from galvanized pipes is dependent on water temperature. The migration was confirmed from the lead pipe as expected. Study points to a problem with elevated concentrations of lead in drinking water faced by older kindergartens and primary schools in Slovenia. All concentrations of lead after <b>flushing</b> the <b>pipes</b> were below the 10 gl, which shows that the most effective action to lower the concentrations of lead is <b>flushing</b> the water <b>pipes.</b> For the purposes of national monitoring of drinking water is necessary to apply a better method for determining lead levels in drinking water namely the sampling of water that stood in the pipes at least 8 to 18 hours. This study has demonstrated the migration of lead from galvanized pipes. This material is also installed in 54 % of kindergartens and primary schools that participated in the study...|$|R
50|$|There was {{a poorly}} {{designed}} installation in the Kullaanvuori water treatment facility. A drinking water pipe {{was connected to}} a wastewater pipe {{for the purpose of}} <b>flushing</b> the wastewater <b>pipe.</b> Such an installation is illegal, and for good reason; if the water pressure in the drinking water pipe is too low, backflow occurs. This is what happened in this event. A maintenance worker accidentally opened the valve, and wastewater flowed into the drinking water supply for two days. The contamination was actually detected, but the company decided to ignore it, assuming it was a transient pulse caused by the repairs.|$|R
40|$|Water Distribution Networks {{are complex}} systems {{containing}} {{a large amount}} of sensors placed in the network. An important task of water quality sensors is to give information to the operators if a contamination has occurred in the network. Generally, the overall analysis of the sensor data is performed manually by the operators since data-driven alarm generation systems for protecting a network in real time are not established at water utilities. This has several reasons: At first, the parameterization of these modules is often very complex and time consuming. Secondly, in most cases these systems generate too many false positive alarms due to special operational actions like sensor calibration or <b>flushing</b> of <b>pipes.</b> In this paper an approach is presented which addresses both problems. First, a self-configuring alarm generation module is proposed which only needs a few parameters to be set. Next, using the module, it is shown that the amount of false positive alarms can be reduced, if known events are used for training the module. This approach is proved in experiments performed on a laboratory plant...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Coal tar and bitumen {{have been}} {{historically}} used {{to coat the}} insides of cast iron drinking water mains. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may leach from these coatings into the drinking water and form a potential health risk for humans. OBJECTIVE: We estimated the potential human cancer risk from PAHs in coated cast iron water mains. METHOD: In a Dutch nationwide study, we collected drinking water samples at 120 locations {{over a period of}} 17 days under various operational conditions, such as undisturbed operation, during <b>flushing</b> of <b>pipes,</b> and after a mains repair, and analyzed these samples for PAHs. We then estimated the health risk associated with an exposure scenario over a lifetime. RESULTS: During flushing, PAH levels frequently exceeded drinking water quality standards; after flushing, these levels dropped rapidly. After the repair of cast iron water mains, PAH levels exceeded the drinking water standards for up to 40 days in some locations. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated margin of exposure for PAH exposure through drinking water was > 10, 000 for all 120 measurement locations, which suggests that PAH exposure through drinking water is of low concern for consumer health. However, factors that differ among water systems, {{such as the use of}} chlorination for disinfection, may influence PAH levels in other locations...|$|R
40|$|Different design {{criteria}} for successful flushing of hydropower headworks have been evaluated. Main {{focus has been}} on handling of floating debris for small hydropower plant in Norway, as well as sediment handling for run of the river-projects in sediment-carrying rivers. As a new way of cleaning intake screens clogged by debris, the concept of backflushing has been investigated. The intake screen, called trash rack, is then cleaned by a reveresed water flow over a short period of time, and the clogged material flushed out thorugh a <b>flushing</b> <b>pipe.</b> A physical test tank was developed to evaluate parameters for a successful flushing of trash racks with different degrees of clogging. A test device was developed to evaluate adhesion, i. e. the level of friction between clogged material and the trash rack. The required gross water velocity over a trash rack during flushing for detaching of the clogged material was found to be in the range of 0. 1 to 0. 2 m/s, with a typical value of 0. 12 m/s. The clogged material tend to resist a maximum limit of pressure difference over the trash rack before it detaches. Results are showing a pressure difference resistance in the range of 0. 05 - 0. 10 meterWater Column (mWC). The pressure difference prove hard to obtain as parts of the trashrack is cleaned. Hence, a flushing gate should be opened at a high rate to obtain the best flushing efficiency. A field trip to Nepal has been conducted to gain experience in sediment handling, and to work with physical models at HydroLab Pvt Ltd in Kathmandu. Observed intake solutions have been evaluated both against existing theory and results from a physical model study. It has been documented through a model test series that the flushing ability of an undersluice gate is limited to only a few meters upstream of the flushing gate. The limit for flushing by bed transport has been tested in a model, and compared to theory for evaluating initial movement of the sediment bed. Experiments are supporting that Shield s theory of critical shear stress can be used to predict the occurrence of bed movement. Design and operation of settling basins have been investigated, together with the appurtenant different strategies for flushing. The possibility of applying the concept of backflushing of trash racks for headworks arrangements including sediment settling basins have been evaluated. For projects where the trash rack can be located upstream of the settling basin, the combination seems feasible, as parts of the water storage in the settling basin could be used for the backflushing. However, the trash rack should be placed downstream of the settling basins for most Himalayan headworks arrangements, which makes backflushing impossible...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{handling}} of debris in small hydro power intakes is assessed by evaluating the concept of back flushing with a horizontally fixed trash rack. The concept of back flushing is to reverse the flow over the trash rack {{for a short period}} of time in order to detach and evacuate clogged debris through a <b>flushing</b> <b>pipe</b> or gate. In this study the concept of back flushing with a horizontal trash rack is evaluated for two different designs; a one chamber design and a two chamber design. The one chamber design is based on H. Brekke?s conceptual idea. The two chamber design is also based on H. Brekke?s idea but it is also inspired by Bergedammen. Bergedammen is an intake designed with two chambers making it possible to continue power production while back flushing one chamber at the time. The efficiency of back flushing as well as the hydraulic performance during normal operation is mainly evaluated using numerical modelling and a CFD-software. The concept of back flushing, general intake hydraulics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is covered by the literature study in this thesis. The evaluation of the back flushing concept is initiated by a physical demonstration model with two chambers. The demonstration model is built and tested for flushing efficiency and performance during normal operation. The following numerical tests are performed on 4 different model designs. The first model illustrates a full scale one chamber design. The second model illustrates a full scale two chamber design. The third model is identical to the demonstration model. The forth model is designed as a result of the demonstration model and the previous numerical models, where important model parameters were identified. The important model parameters for effective flushing and hydraulic performance during normal operation is identified as the height of the weir, the vertical position of the trash rack, the length of the model and the amount of water available for flushing. The numerical analyses evaluate the flushing efficiency by assessing the velocity distribution over the trash rack. The hydraulic performance of the models during normal operation is evaluated by assessing streamlines, head loss and turbulent kinetic energy levels (TKE) by the outlet. During flushing the most important parameter is the height between the top of the weir and the trash rack. A high weir results in an even velocity distribution over the trash rack. A low weir results in uneven velocities with higher velocities along the weir. During normal production the length of the model and the height of the weir are important parameters affecting both the total head loss and TKE-values. The results achieved by the numerical modelling should be validated, as further research, on a scale model designed and built in the lab. The test program for the scale model is presented in this study. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{majority}} of digital circuits/systems primarily use synchronous clocking methodology. With clock distribution networks dissipating ever {{more power and}} the wire delays expected to become dominant, there has been increased activity to provide alternative solutions. This paper explores some potential methods for reducing global interconnect delays and improving throughput between communicating modules. Analysis of the classical repeater insertion is performed and a wave-pipelined repeater insertion scheme that addresses some shortfalls of the classical repeater insertion is proposed. An extension of the wave-pipelined repeater insertion scheme is presented and results show that its data retention capability offers reliable communication between any number of computing elements. The design of the communication channel {{is based on the}} assumption that the computing elements employ synchronous clocking while the communication channels are driven by locally generated clocks. Locally generating clocks along the communication channel avoids the clock distribution complexities and offers an ability to stop and start data transfer along the channel without the need for elaborate clock gating circuitry. Furthermore, no additional clock cycles are required to <b>flush</b> the <b>pipe</b> in the event of stalls. The circuitry that generates local clocks increases area and power, but shows significant performance advantages, particularly in providing a seamless interface between communicating modules running at different clock frequencies. Simulation results of the distributed FIFO communication channel in a modest 180 nm technology show locally generated clocks running at 2. 22 GHz with the memory buffers placed 2 mm apart. The handshaking interchange between neighboring control circuits shows an average delay of 285. 35 ps. I...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{assesses the}} need for additional tank isolation systems and tooling at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Locations for future operations at ORNL include the South and North Tank Farms and various Federal Facilities Agreement tanks. The goal of this report is to identify future needs for development of remote tools and systems to isolate inactive waste storage tanks. Remote tools have been developed to support waste-retrieval and tank-isolation operations at the Gunite and Associated Tanks (GAATs) at ORNL. The tools developed for in-tank remote operations include a pipe-cutting tool (a modified band saw), a pipe-cleaning tool (a modified drill with a wire brush), and a pipe plug. A review of the planned future operations revealed several desirable modifications to improve the efficiency, operability, and flexibility of the existing tank-isolation tools. For example, the pipe-cutting tool needs improvements to provide better alignment, a blade-cutting-release device, improved tire replacement, sensors to prevent operation of the saw when the blade stops, blade speed controls, and force feedback sensors. In addition, the need to test the existing pipe plug for use on corroded piping was identified. The pipe plug has been used on only relatively clean in-tank stainless steel (SS) piping to date. However, there may be a need later to use the plug on corroded SS and other types of pipes. Improvements to the pipe plug for use on <b>flush</b> wall <b>pipes</b> and small-diameter openings in tanks are also desirable. Besides tank isolation, those performing tank closures may need to use cutting and capping equipment on buried pipes. The current cutting and capping equipment may have to be modified for deployment systems other than the Modified Light Duty Utility Arm, for which they were initially designed. Improved cutting and other remote systems may also be needed to dispose of contaminated equipment and tank shells. These requirements will be defined jointly by the U. S. Department of Energy, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the state of Tennessee as part of the overall remedial decision for the ORNL Bethel Valley area...|$|R

40|$|Coastal {{areas of}} Hong Kong Island {{are one of}} the most {{extensively}} urbanized areas in the world. Groundwater samples in natural slopes and developed spaces in the regions centered by the Mid-Levels area, Hong Kong Island, were collected and analyzed to investigate the natural and anthropogenic processes affecting the groundwater chemistry. The results presented may be of value to other coastal areas in the world for the identification of possible groundwater contamination sources. Groundwater samples in the natural slopes were in low total dissolved solid (TDS) (< 100 mg/l), indicating that the waters were in the early evolutionary stage. Using chloride as a normalizing factor, the "non-marine" components of different major ions in the samples were calculated. The correlation analysis indicated the occurrence of weathering of plagioclase feldspars in the natural slopes. However, the breakdown of biotite and K-feldspar seems to be limited by short groundwater residence time and high resistance to weathering. The high variety in hydrochemical facies may suggest the presence of extremely heterogeneous subsurface geological conditions. In the developed spaces, groundwater samples exhibited a high range of TDS (∼ 100 - 5300 mg/l) and were mainly dominated by Na-Cl and Na-Ca-Cl water types. Besides water-rock interactions, the groundwater chemistry was significantly affected by leakage from service pipes and the dissolution of concrete materials. Some chemicals were used as signatures to identify the leakage from various service pipes. The area generally suffered from widespread, but small amount of leakages, and no obvious leakage was discovered. The strong correlations among major cations and chloride suggested that even a small amount of leakage from salty <b>flushing</b> water <b>pipes</b> can significantly affect the groundwater chemistry. Groundwater is found to be highly aggressive toward concrete as supported by three commonly used aggressiveness indices. Additional Ca 2 + may be released to groundwater by corrosion of subsurface concrete materials such as building foundations and basements. The strength of those subsurface engineering structures may be weakened. Besides, excess Ca 2 + may deposit in the dewatering systems in the area, which may affect their performance in lowering high water tables. The findings regarding leakage from service pipes will be useful for various government organizations such as the Water Supplies Department and Drainage Services Department. Discussion of the behavior of Ca 2 + is instructional to foundation and slope dewatering designs in the area. © Springer-Verlag 2005. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

A number of numerical solutions to the time-dependent unsteady flow equations were considered and the method of characteristics was chosen for its suitability and proven usefulness. Full-scale flow tests were undertaken in the laboratory to validate the use of the method of characteristics and the results justified the development of a network model incorporating subsections to simulate end boundaries, junctions and multiple inflows. The final computer model of the building drainage system was completed using a representation of flow in a vertical stack based on work published elsewhere. The program is capable of simulating multi-storey drainage systems with multiple flow inputs and variable boundary and junction types. It is restricted to level invert junctions and requires the steady-flow depth characteristics of each type of junction within the program. The program can be used to output depth or flow rate through time at any point in the system and could therefore be used by a designer to evaluate the performance of new systems. The program could also be used to determine the effects of water conservation legislation on system design...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of biofilms {{in drinking water}} distribution systems (DWDS) is a global concern. Those are responsible for aesthetic problems in drinking water (DW) such as taste, odor and color, and can also be responsible for public health problems when pathogens are biofilm colonizers. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to use effective control strategies. The aim of this work {{was to understand the}} effects of the combination of chemical (sodium hypochlorite NaOCl) and mechanical (<b>pipe</b> <b>flushing)</b> treatments on the removal of single and dual species biofilms of two bacteria isolated from drinking water, Acinectobacter calcoaceticus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Those are common strategies used in DWDS. A rotating cylinder reactor was used {{for the first time as}} DWDS model for biofilm formation and control. The combination of chemical and mechanical treatments was not able to completely remove biofilms from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) surface. Chemical treatment did not improve the flushing efficiency of A. calcoaceticus biofilms and increased the recalcitrance of S. maltophilia biofilms to mechanical treatment, even when high shear stress was applied. Nevertheless, NaOCl improved the mechanical removal of dual species biofilm. The dual species biofilm remaining after treatment with NaOCl at 0. 5 mg. l- 1 was 78 %, while after being treated with the NaOCl at the minimum inhibitory concentration 12 % of biofilm remained on PVC surface. The overall results demonstrate that chemical and mechanical treatments commonly used in DWDS are not effective in biofilm control. The colonizer strain strongly influences the biofilm phenotype and its susceptibility to control strategies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} the {{general-purpose}} precise interrupt mechanisms in use {{for the past few}} decades have received very little attention. When modern out-of-order processors handle interrupts precisely, they typically begin by flushing the pipeline to make the CPU available to execute handler instructions. In doing so, the CPU ends up flushing many instructions that have been brought in to the reorder buffer. In particular, many of these instructions have reached a very deep stage in the pipeline-representing significant work that is wasted. In addition, an overhead of several cycles can be expected in re-fetching and re-executing these instructions. This paper concentrates on improving the performance of precisely handling software managed translation lookaside buffer (TLB) interrupts, one of the most frequently occurring interrupts. This paper presents a novel method of in-lining the interrupt handler within the reorder buffer. Since the first level interrupt-handlers of TLBs are usually small, they could potentially fit in the reorder buffer along with the user-level code already there. In doing so, the instructions that would otherwise be <b>flushed</b> from the <b>pipe</b> need not be re-fetched and re-executed. Additionally, it allows for instructions independent of the exceptional instruction to continue to execute in parallel with the handler code. We simulate two different schemes of in-lining the interrupt on a processor with a 4 -way out-of-order core similar to the Alpha 21264. We also analyzed the overhead of re-fetching and re-executing instructions when handling an interrupt by the traditional method. We find that our schemes significantly cut back on the number of instructions being re-fetched by 50 - 90 %, and also provides a performance improvement of 5 - 25 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{general-purpose}} precise interrupt mechanism, {{which has}} long been used to handle exceptional conditions that occur infre-quently, is now being used increasingly often to handle conditions that are neither exceptional nor infrequent. One example {{is the use of}} interrupts to perform memory management-e. g., to handle translation lookaside buffer (TLB) misses in today’s microproces-sors. Because the frequency of TLB misses tends to increase with memory footprint, there is pressure on the precise interrupt mech-anism to become more lightweight. When modem out-of order processors handle interrupts precisely, they typically begin by flushing the pipeline. Doing so makes the CPU available to exe-cute handler instructions, but it wastes potentially hundreds of cycles of execution time. However; if the handler code is small, it could potentially j t in the reorder buffer along with the user-level code already there. This essentially in-lines the interrupt-handler code. One good example of where this would be both possible and useful is in the TLB-miss handler in a software-managed TLB implementation. The benejts of doing so are two-fold: (1) the instructions that would otherwise be <b>flushed</b> from the <b>pipe</b> need not be re-fetched and re-executed; and (2) any instructions that are independent of the exceptional instruction can continue to exe-cute in parallel with the handler code. In effect, doing so provides us with lockup-free TLBs. We simulate a lockup-free data-TLB facility on a processor model with a 4 -way out-of-order core remi-niscent of the Alpha 21264. We find that, by using lockup-jree TLBs, one can get the performance of a fully associative TLB with a lockup-free TLB of one-fourth the size...|$|R

This paper concentrates on improving the performance of precisely handling software managed translation look-aside buffer (TLB) interrupts, one of the most frequently occurring interrupts.

By in-lining the TLB interrupt handler, this provides lock-up free TLBs. This paper proposes the prepend and append schemes of in-lining the interrupt handler into the available reorder buffer space. The two schemes are implemented on a performance model of the Alpha 21264 processor built by Alpha designers at the Palo Alto Design Center (PADC), California. We compare the overhead and performance impact of handling TLB interrupts by the traditional scheme, the append in-lined scheme, and the prepend in-lined scheme. Fo...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the needs}} of the oil {{industry}} ask for a simple, compact and maintenance-free device to measure the mass flowrate of two-phase and three-phase (e. g. oil-gas-water) mixtures, to be used mainly for well testing. In this work the possibility of using a device based on a Venturi nozzle for industrial multiphase mass flowrate measurements has been investigated. In case of multiphase systems, the relationship between the overall mass flowrate and the pressure drop in a Venturi nozzle is not unique and includes also the flow quality, so that measurements of quality or holdup have to be included. An experimental facility for the study of any combination of oil, air and water flow has been built and operated. It consists of a vertical perspex pipe of 50 mm internal diameter and about 7 m length. The facility can be operated at atmospheric pressure and at the present makes use of air, water and diesel-fuel oil. The Venturi meter has been tested in air-water and air-oil-water flow; the superficial velocities ranged up to 1. 8 m/s for oil and water and up to 20 m/s for air. Conductance probes, made of two stainless steel rings mounted <b>flush</b> to the <b>pipe</b> wall and placed at different positions in the pipe and in the Venturi throat allowed the measurement of the local liquid holdup for the case of air- water flow. Conventional measurements included pressure drop and absolute pressures. The results show that a unique relationship can be inferred among the pressure drop across the Venturi, normalized with respect to the pressure drop relative to the liquid phase flowing alone in the nozzle, and the flow quality in any combination of the three phases...|$|R
40|$|The {{operating}} {{clock frequency}} {{is determined by}} the longest signal propagation delay, setup/hold time, and timing margin. These are becoming less predictable with the increasing design complexity and process miniaturization. The difficult challenge is then to ensure that a device operating at its clock frequency is error-free with quantifiable assurance. Effort at device-level engineering will not suffice for these circuits exhibiting wide process variation and heightened sensitivities to operating condition stress. Logic-level redress of this issue is a necessity and we propose a design-level remedy for this timing-uncertainty problem. The aim of the design and analysis approaches presented in this dissertation is to provide framework, SABRE, wherein an increased operating clock frequency can be achieved. The approach is a combination of analytical modeling, experimental analy- sis, hardware /time-redundancy design, exception handling and recovery techniques. Our proposed design replicates only a necessary part of the original circuit to avoid high hardware overhead as in triple-modular-redundancy (TMR). The timing-critical combinational circuit is path-wise partitioned into two sections. The combinational circuits associated with long paths are laid out without any intrusion except for the fan-out connections from the first section of the circuit to a replicated second section of the combinational circuit. Thus only the second section of the circuit is replicated. The signals fanning out from the first section are latches, and thus are far shorter than the paths spanning the entire combinational circuit. The replicated circuit is timed at a subsequent clock cycle to ascertain relaxed timing paths. This insures that the likelihood of mistiming due to stress or process variation is eliminated. During the subsequent clock cycle, the outcome of the two logically identical, yet time-interleaved, circuit outputs are compared to detect faults. When a fault is detected, the retry sig- nal is triggered and the dynamic frequency-step-down takes place before a <b>pipe</b> <b>flush,</b> and retry is issued. The significant timing overhead associated with the retry is offset by the rarity of the timing violation events. Simulation results on ISCAS Benchmark circuits show that 10 % of clock frequency gain is possible with 10 to 20 % of hardware overhead of replicated timing-critical circuit...|$|R
