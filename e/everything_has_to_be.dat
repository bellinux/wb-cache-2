She also worked on clenching her facial muscles {{and maintaining a}} clipped walking pace. [...] "That was just Tracy, it so escapes me how it came out!" [...] she said. [...] "I just imagined how uptight people carry themselves, and they grind their teeth at night and they clench their jaw because <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> just perfect."

500|$|When {{asked by}} The Quietus if the {{songs from the}} album drew from his {{personal}} experiences, Frank commented [...] "My kitchen is usually pretty clean, you know. But you have fun with the imagery, and for me the whole concept that <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be...</b> Like, nobody gets upset with a director when a director's film isn't about his life. People think that with a recording artist that shit has {{to be like a}} fucking play by play of their whole life, but it's not. It's imagery, {{and a little bit of}} satire." [...] When asked if he made R music, Ocean replied that he disliked how that in the United States, [...] "if you're a singer and you're black, you're an R artist. Period." [...] Ocean stated that the songs on the mixtape do contain R influences, but that it is not an R album entirely.|$|E

The song appears on his debut mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra, which was released on February 18, 2011. When asked by The Quietus about his own interpretation of the character in the song {{it was noted that}} Ocean [...] "politely withdrew, saying he'd enjoy that discussion but he doesn't want to spoil his audience's experience of his songs". He further commented [...] "but you have fun with the imagery, and for me the whole concept that <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be...</b> Like, nobody gets upset with a director when a director's film isn't about his life.

I Did It Again Tour (2000), Spears {{revealed}} {{she felt}} inspired by hip hop {{artists such as}} Jay-Z and The Neptunes and {{wanted to create a}} record with a funkier sound. In February 2001, Spears signed a $7–8 million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, entitled A Mother's Gift. On the same month, Spears started to record material for her third studio album, with [...] "Overprotected" [...] being recorded at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Additional recording was done in April 2001 at Maratone in Sweden, in which the song's vocals were completed. Background vocals were provided by Spears and Bosslady, with the track being mixed by Martin and Rami at Maratone Studios. Her third studio album, Britney, was released in November 2001. In an interview with the Daily Record, Spears concluded she can relate to [...] "Overprotected" [...] "on a personal basis, because I feel kind of overprotected. When I want to go out, <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> organized in advance. I think that other kids of my age can relate to it to a certain extent." ...|$|E

[...] "They {{have put up}} some large {{bakeries}} at Abrantes and, as the flour is brought up in boats, there is no difficulty that way. They get their meat pretty regularly, and their wine always.

Besides, <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> arranged, and {{we have got to}} get to the bottom of this matter; so if you have no objection, we will travel home together. If the young people here want to dawdle about any longer they can do so; I dare say they can look after themselves, or if not, I can make an arrangement with some old lady or other to act as Alice's chaperon." ...|$|E

40|$|In a {{somewhat}} self-defeating manner, {{it could be}} asked, whether it <b>is</b> worthwhile <b>to</b> analyse the Swedish agricultural policy reform of 1990.

60|$|As for the hen it scuttled, screaming, {{every way}} at once. It was a marvellous bird: {{it seemed to}} be able to run up a {{straight}} wall quite easily; and it and the cat between them fetched down mostly everything that was not already on the floor. In less than forty seconds there were nine people in that room, all trying to kick one dog. Possibly, now and again, one or another may have succeeded, for occasionally the dog would stop barking in order to howl. But it did not discourage him. <b>Everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid for, he evidently argued, even a pig and chicken hunt; and, on the whole, the game was worth it.|$|E

60|$|In {{the tumultuous}} {{business}} of cutting-in and attending to a whale, {{there is much}} running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one place; for at {{one and the same}} time <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale's back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster's back for the special purpose referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume-- a shirt and socks--in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.|$|E
60|$|But {{where the}} {{material}} conditions {{for such a}} state of affairs exist, the psychological conditions {{are not likely to}} exist unless power is very widely diffused throughout the community. Where power is concentrated in a few, it will happen, unless those few are very exceptional people, that they will value tangible achievements in the way of increase in trade or empire more than the slow and less obvious improvements that would result from better education combined with more leisure. The joys of victory are especially great to the holders of power, while the evils of a mechanical organization fall almost exclusively upon the less influential. For these reasons, I do not believe that any community in which power is much concentrated will long refrain from conflicts of the kind involving a sacrifice of what is most valuable in the individual. In Russia at this moment, the sacrifice of the individual is largely inevitable, because of the severity of the economic and military struggle. But I did not feel, in the Bolsheviks, any consciousness of the magnitude of this misfortune, or any realization {{of the importance of the}} individual as against the State. Nor do I believe that men who do realize this are likely to succeed, or to come to the top, in times when <b>everything</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done against personal liberty. The Bolshevik theory requires that every country, sooner or later, should go through what Russia is going through now. And in every country in such a condition we may expect to find the government falling into the hands of ruthless men, who have not by nature any love for freedom, and who will see little importance in hastening the transition from dictatorship to freedom. It is far more likely that such men will be tempted to embark upon new enterprises, requiring further concentration of forces, and postponing indefinitely the liberation of the populations which they use as their material.|$|E
