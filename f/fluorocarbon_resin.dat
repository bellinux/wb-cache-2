40|$|Abstract ― It is {{commonly}} known that water repellency {{of the fabric}} treated with <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>resin</b> brings about a decrease by the washing and recovers by the subsequent heat treatment. In this article, effect of the water repellency was investigated on the nylon 6, triacetate and silk fabrics treated with hydrocarbon and silicon resins. Hydrocarbon and silicon resins {{have been widely used}} in the textile finishing as the softening and water proofing agents. The fabrics were treated with hydrocarbon resins, Paragium JQ and RC (Ohara Paragium Chemical Co.) and a silicon resin, Poron MR (Shinetsu Chemical Co.), and then washed and subsequently heat treated. Although the water repellency increased by the resin treatment, it decreased by the washing apparently and recovered a little by the heat treatment. The effect of the heat treatment was small comparing with that of the <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>resin.</b> Furthermore, as a mechanical property of the treated fabric, KES shearing and bending hysteresis parameters, modulus and hysteresis width of the hydrocarbon resin-treated nylon 6, triacetate and silk fabrics decreased by the heat treatment after washing. Therefore, the treatment is effective at improving the softening of the fabric in water repellent finish...|$|E
50|$|Teflon is DuPont's {{registered}} trademark for its non-stick coatings. Teflon coatings are specially formulated finishes {{that are based}} on PTFE, PFA, FEP, and ETFE <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>resins.</b> Teflon-S is a related family of fluorocarbon coatings containing binding resins which provide increased hardness, abrasion resistance, and other desirable properties.|$|R
50|$|Polymerization of {{tetrafluoroethylene}} produces polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) polymers such as Teflon and Fluon. PTFE {{is one of}} the two <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>resins</b> composed wholly of fluorine and carbon. The other resin composed purely {{of carbon}} and fluorine is the copolymer of TFE with typically 6-9% hexafluoropropene (HFP), which is known as FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymer). TFE is also used in the preparation of numerous copolymers that also include hydrogen and/or oxygen, including both fluoroplastics and fluoroelastomers. Typical TFE-based fluoroplastics include ETFE, the alternating 1:1 copolymer with ethylene, and PFA, which is a random copolymer similar to FEP but with a minor amount of a perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether (PAVE) rather than HFP. DuPont uses primarily perfluoro(methylvinylether), whereas Daikin uses primarily perfluoro(propylvinylether) in manufacturing PFA. There are numerous other fluoropolymers that contain tetrafluoroethylene, but usually not at greater than 50% by weight.|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss a}} method of {{improving}} adhesion to <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>resin</b> by irradiation with an XeCl excimer laser. The adhesive force between the polymer and metal, and contact angles with water {{as measured by the}} shear test method and a Ne-He laser system, respectively, are improved when the polymer surface is irradiated in the presence of water or solutions of boric acid, sodium hydroxide, copper sulfate, and sodium aluminate. The results are interpreted in terms of a simple laser heating model. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} is to study the {{protection}} performance of <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>resin</b> coatings on galvanized sheets with electrochemical impedance spectra(EIS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for UV ageing to simulate nature environment. The results indicated that impedance of the coatings acted as a capacitive character at the early UV ageing stage. the diffusion impedance was shown in low-frequency range, which was attributed to the self-healing effect of the chromate layer to the metal interface. After 2000 hours of ageing in the UV chamber, there is a low impedance values in the impedance spectra. Taking into account defects were found on the film surface on SEM picture, it is easy that the outside corrosive substances meet metal substrate through the coating at the defects...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} the present study was the semi-industrial {{scale-up}} of the hydro and oil repellent finishing of textile fabrics by ultraviolet (UV) curing of silica based or <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>resins</b> on fiber surface. The method applied at laboratory scale to cotton, polyester and polyamide fibers was already studied in previous works [1 - 3]: the optimization of process parameters, followed by a deep characterization of treated samples, revealed the effectiveness of the treatment. In the present study, a great number of larger fabric samples were impregnated by padding with commercial finishing agents and then were irradiated with an high power, semi industrial UV lamp, in air. Samples add-on was significantly reduced in order to hold down the finishing cost. White and dyed samples of different textile composition were treated and evaluated in terms of conferred repellency, yellowing or color changes. Most relevant process parameters were investigated, considering the thermal process normally adopted at industrial level as reference. Results were so statistically evaluated by Six Sigma method with Minitab 16 software, to point out the most influencing parameters and the real possibility to replace the thermal treatment with UV-curing.

30|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to develop shrink {{resistance}} cotton textile by making it hydrophobic. The cotton fabric was made hydrophobic by treating with <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>resin</b> emulsion at varying concentrations along with catalyst. The hydrophobicity was measured by carrying out water repellency test and also determining the water contact angle. The air permeability of cotton fabric was also determined and was not adversely affected. The untreated and treated cotton fabric was subjected to repeated domestic laundry condition and shrinkage was measured. In order to determine the impact of fluorocarbon treatment on fabric, the physical properties of treated and untreated cotton fabrics were compared. No adverse impact was observed in colour fastness properties. The tensile and tear strength showed good retention even at higher concentration of water repellent chemicals. This work finds wide use in home textiles and hotel industry. This work is of industrial interest as value added shrink resistance cotton textiles can fetch more export earnings.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} (molding) guideline {{to realize}} ultraclean resin components for semiconductor equipment has been established. In this paper, {{we focused on}} the degradation behavior of resin materials {{for the purpose of}} reducing low-molecular-weight volatile contaminants concentration in resin components because the molding is carried out at high temperature and low-molecular-weight volatile contaminants are produced by thermal degradation. It was clarified that the oxygen concentration in high temperature molding environment is required to be below 1 ppm. And as the contact surface of the thermal degradation prevention for the resin material, the following surface materials are effective. 1) Passivation surface for a hydrocarbon resin. 2) Ni (nickel) surface for a <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>resin.</b> As a result, we found the degradation prevention of the resin material can be realized until around 400 °C although the degradation was observed even under 200 °C if using current process condition. Therefore, low-molecular-weight volatile contaminants can be drastically reduced from resin components by using the guideline and ultraclean semiconductor equipment must be realized...|$|E

40|$|The {{success of}} metal-ceramic restorations depends on an optimal bond between metal and ceramic. This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} 3 casting atmospheres on the metal-ceramic bond strength (MCBS) of 2 Ni-Cr alloys, with beryllium (Fit Cast V) and without beryllium (Fit Cast SB). Sixty acrylic resin patterns (8 mm long and 5 mm diameter) were obtained using a <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>resin</b> matrix. Wax was used to refine the surface of acrylic resin patterns that were invested and cast in an induction casting machine under normal, vacuum, and argon atmospheres at a temperature of 1340 ºC. The castings were divested manually and airborne-particle abraded with 100 -µm aluminum-oxide. Ten castings were obtained for each group. The IPS Classic V ceramic was applied (2 mm high and 5 mm diameter). The shear bond strength was tested in a mechanical testing machine with a crosshead speed of 2. 0 mm/min. The MCBS data (MPa) were subjected to 2 -way analysis of variance (&# 945;= 0. 05). There was {{no statistically significant difference}} (p> 0. 05) between the alloys or among the casting atmospheres. Within the limitations of this study, it may be concluded that the presence of beryllium and the casting atmosphere did not interfere in the MCBS of the evaluated metal-ceramic combination...|$|E
