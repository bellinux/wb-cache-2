2500|$|A {{person on}} a moving swing can {{increase}} the amplitude of the swing's oscillations without any external <b>drive</b> <b>force</b> (pushes) being applied, by changing the moment of inertia of the swing by {{rocking back and forth}} ("pumping") or alternately standing and squatting, in rhythm with the swing's oscillations. [...] The varying of the parameters drives the system. [...] Examples of parameters that may be varied are its resonance frequency [...] and damping [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{existing}} clock movement, {{the verge}} escapement, made pendulums swing in very wide arcs of about 100°. Huygens showed {{this was a}} source of inaccuracy, causing the period to vary with amplitude changes caused by small unavoidable variations in the clock's <b>drive</b> <b>force.</b> [...] To make its period isochronous, Huygens mounted cycloidal-shaped metal 'chops' next to the pivots in his clocks, that constrained the suspension cord and forced the pendulum to follow a cycloid arc. [...] This solution didn't prove as practical as simply limiting the pendulum's swing to small angles of a few degrees. The realization that only small swings were isochronous [...] motivated the development of the anchor escapement around 1670, which reduced the pendulum swing in clocks to 4°–6°.|$|E
5000|$|A {{major cause}} of error in clocks is changes in the <b>drive</b> <b>force</b> applied to the escapement, caused by small changes in the {{friction}} of the gears or the pallets, or the diminishing force of the mainspring as it unwinds. An escapement in which changes in <b>drive</b> <b>force</b> do not affect the rate is called isochronous. The superior performance of the deadbeat over the recoil is due to improved isochronism. This {{is due to the}} different ways changes in <b>drive</b> <b>force</b> affect the swing of the pendulum in the two escapements: ...|$|E

50|$|Remontoires {{are used}} because the {{timekeeping}} mechanism in clocks and watches, the pendulum or balance wheel, is never isochronous; that is its rate {{is affected by}} changes in the <b>drive</b> <b>force</b> applied to it. In spring driven timepieces, the <b>drive</b> <b>force</b> declines as the mainspring runs down. In weight driven clocks the <b>drive</b> <b>force,</b> provided by a weight suspended by a cord, is more constant, but imperfections in the gear train and variations in lubrication also cause small variations. In turret clocks, the large hands, which {{are attached to the}} clock's wheel train, are exposed to the weather {{on the outside of the}} tower, so winds and accumulations of ice and snow apply disturbing forces to the hands, which are passed on to the wheel train.|$|E

50|$|A gravity {{escapement}} uses a small {{weight or}} a weak spring {{to give an}} impulse directly to the pendulum. The earliest form consisted of two arms which were pivoted {{very close to the}} suspension spring of the pendulum with one arm {{on each side of the}} pendulum. Each arm carried a small dead beat pallet with an angled plane leading to it. When the pendulum lifted one arm far enough its pallet would release the escape wheel. Almost immediately another tooth on the escape wheel would start to slide up the angle face on the other arm thereby lifting the arm. It would reach the pallet and stop. The other arm meanwhile was still in contact with pendulum and coming down again to a point lower than it had started from. This lowering of the arm provides the impulse to the pendulum. The design was developed steadily from the middle of the 18th century to the middle of the 19th century. It eventually became the escapement of choice for turret clocks, because their wheel trains are subjected to large variations in <b>drive</b> <b>force</b> caused by the large exterior hands, with their varying wind, snow, and ice loads. Since in a gravity escapement the <b>drive</b> <b>force</b> from the wheel train does not itself impel the pendulum but merely resets the weights that provide the impulse, the escapement is not affected by variations in <b>drive</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
