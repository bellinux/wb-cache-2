5000|$|Contemporary {{dashboards}} {{may include}} the speedometer, tachometer, odometer and fuel gauge, turn indicators, gearshift position <b>indicator,</b> <b>seat</b> belt warning light, parking-brake warning light, and engine-malfunction lights. Other features may include indicators for low fuel, low oil pressure, low tire pressure and faults in the airbag (SRS) systems, glove compartment, ashtray and a cigarette lighter or power outlet [...] - [...] {{as well as}} heating and ventilation systems, lighting controls, safety systems, entertainment equipment and information systems, e.g., navigation systems.|$|R
50|$|Between October 2013 {{and around}} March 2015, the fleet was {{scheduled}} to be retro-fitted with LED <b>seat</b> reservation status <b>indicators</b> above each <b>seat.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{direction}} indicators double as hazard warning <b>indicators.</b> The rear <b>seat</b> grab handles feature a high grip central insert for extra passenger safety, extending rearwards sporting a backrest.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] Honda C71 and C72 Dream, and the {{identical}} C76 and C77 bikes with [...] displacement, {{were the first}} larger-capacity motorcycles that Honda mass-exported. They were characterised by a pressed steel frame and alloy overhead cam twin-cylinder engines, and were very well equipped, with 12 volt electrics, electric starter, <b>indicators,</b> dual <b>seats</b> and other advanced features, not common to most motorcycles of the period.|$|R
50|$|From 1 October 2013, one 11-car 651 series {{formation}} {{was brought}} back into service {{for use on}} two Fresh Hitachi services daily while the E657 series fleet undergoes modification work to add LED <b>seat</b> reservation status <b>indicators</b> above each <b>seat.</b> This continued until March 2015.|$|R
50|$|In early 1996, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited (HACTL) {{received}} four Dennis Dragons {{for use as}} staff buses. They {{were similar}} with Citybus's 12-metre Dragon in appearance but with no route <b>indicators</b> and narrower <b>seats</b> were fitted so as to increase the seating capacity.|$|R
50|$|It was the {{recipient}} of the 32nd Laurel Prize of the Japan Railfan Club. Extra sets were built in 2002 to cope with the increase in traffic during the 2002 FIFA World Cup. These sets were classified 253-200 series, and included minor improvements over the original 253-0 and 253-100 series sets, such as LED destination <b>indicators,</b> conventional rotating <b>seats</b> in standard class, and 2+1 seating in Green Cars.|$|R
50|$|The fifth {{batch of}} 253 series trains (classified 253-200 series) {{consisting}} of two six-car sets, Ne201 and Ne202, were delivered from Tokyu Car in 2002 {{in anticipation of the}} 2002 FIFA World Cup which was expected to further increase passenger traffic on the Narita Express. Variable frequency traction systems were built into these trains, and they were fitted with DT69 and TR254 bogies. The interior differed from previous batches, with LED destination <b>indicators,</b> conventional rotating <b>seats</b> in standard class, and 2+1 seating in Green cars.|$|R
50|$|From {{the start}} of the revised {{timetable}} on 17 March 2012, new 10-car E657 series EMUs were introduced on Fresh Hitachi services, operating alongside existing 651 series and E653 series sets, and as of 16 March 2013, all services are operated using E657 series EMUs. During the period between 1 October 2013 and around March 2015, however, one up and one down Fresh Hitachi service daily will be operated by an 11-car 651 series formation covering while the E657 series fleet undergoes modification work to add LED <b>seat</b> reservation status <b>indicators</b> above each <b>seat.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{hybrid system}} for {{detecting}} driver drowsiness was examined by using piezofilm movement sensors {{integrated into the}} car seat, seat belt and steering wheel. Statistical associations between increase in the driver drowsiness and the non-invasive and conventional physiological indicators were investigated. Statistically significant associations were established for the analysed physiological <b>indicators</b> – car <b>seat</b> movement magnitude and (electroencephalogram) EEG alpha band power percentage. All of the associastions were physiologically plausible with increase in probability of drowsiness associated with increases in the EEG alpha band power percentage and reduction in the seat movement magnitude. Adding a non-invasive measure such as seat movement magnitude to any combination of the EEG derived physiological predictors always resulted in improvement of associations. These findings {{can serve as a}} foundation for designing the vehicle-based fatigue countermeasure device as well as highlight potential difficulties and limitations of detection algorithm for such devices...|$|R
5000|$|The Theatre Historical Society {{will have}} a {{magazine}} called Marquee (that's the logo Lester Glassner has designed for us {{at the top of}} this page) which will be published six times a year ... on a modest scale at first., more lavishly and more frequently as we get rolling. It will be filled with pictures and articles on every phase of movie palace lore -- portfolios of tantalizing newspaper ads, articles on everything from how to build your own model movie palace, how a Publix <b>seat</b> <b>indicator</b> works, how to operate the Brenkert F-7 Master Brenograph, to what to do in case of a stink bomb attack; picture stories on leading theatre architects (maybe special issues devoted to the work of one man); reports on everything from the animal rooms on the Keith Circuit to the hospital facilities in the super-palaces. The possibilities are endless.|$|R
40|$|This {{literature}} review identifies the main literature that relates students’ seat choice to performance and evaluates and interprets the literature results together with literature that highlights possible reasons for seat choice. The majority of research {{studies on the}} relationship between seat location and performance have identified that students seated in the central-front zones have higher course grades than students sitting further back. However, prior subject experience and academic ability may affect results and should be controlled within studies. Only a few studies have done this and most used self-reported academic grades, such as GPA, which have a potential for error, particularly amongst weaker students. A student’s seat reference, rather than actual seat, may be a better <b>indicator</b> of performance. <b>Seat</b> preference maybe driven by the personality of the student. Students who are more motivated and are more positive about a course are more likely to sit in the central-front zones. Therefore, personality traits should also form part of a thorough study...|$|R
50|$|Luxor, Twickenham (1929):The Luxor, {{later the}} Odeon, Twickenham, {{the best of}} his cinemas in Egyptian style, had a façade {{combining}} Art Deco and Egyptian styles and an Egyptian interior with blue sky, clouds, and the sun depicted on the ceiling, a bird in flight over the proscenium arch and carpeting in a special Egyptian design. It opened in 1929 with 1,709 seats, usherettes dressed as Cleopatra, a symphony orchestra and a new-model Compton organ with a full range of percussion. It also had a large, well-equipped stage and four dressing rooms. The lobby was in modern style and had two box offices with automatic <b>indicators</b> showing what <b>seats</b> were available, and there was a central air purification, heating and cooling system. The cinema closed in 1981 after a final organ concert; part of the organ was incorporated into the Compton organ at the Odeon Leicester Square, and the building was demolished in 1986.|$|R
2500|$|The {{next and}} largest Pacer class was the Class 142. This again {{was built by}} Leyland and BREL, in 1985. The body {{was based on a}} Leyland National bus, built at Lillyhall, Workington in Cumbria. Many {{fixtures}} and fittings of the Leyland National could be found on the units. The new class had a greater capacity of 120 passengers per two-car set and the same engines were used. The first sets were used initially on Devon and Cornwall branch lines and on commuter services in the North West. The units from Cornwall were eventually moved to Liverpool and the North-East, and the Class 142s have become a common sight on services across the North of England. The class was upgraded in the early 1990s to include more powerful Cummins engines, which gave a total power output of [...] per two-car set. A number of units were then modified for use on the Merseyside PTE City Line on Merseyrail in the Liverpool region, which included dot-matrix route <b>indicators,</b> improved <b>seating</b> and Merseyrail PTE paintwork. This class moved into the control of First North Western at privatisation and subsequently passed on to Northern Rail and Arriva Trains Wales who have since operated it. Eight units were temporarily withdrawn from service, replaced by a cascading of British Rail Class 158s. First Great Western received 12 units on loan from Northern Rail from December 2007 to November 2011 (5 units were returned to Northern in December 2008) to cover for refurbishment of their fleet and to allow most of their Class 158 fleet to be rebuilt as 3-car sets.|$|R
40|$|Detailed soil-gas {{surveys have}} been {{conducted}} at two mine districts to better comprehend gas migration mechanisms from deposits buried at different depths. The Tolfa (Lazio, Central Italy) and Neves-Corvo (Baixo Alentejo, Portugal) mine districts have different characteristics: the former is superficial (30 - 100 m) while the latter is located {{at a depth of}} 400 - 500 m and covered by low-permeability metamorphic rocks. The soil-gas results from these two different investigated areas provide interesting results related to the study of far- and near-field gas migration mechanisms. In particular, the anomalous concentrations of sulphur compounds (COS, CS 2 e SO 2), CO 2, and Rn confirmed the presence of the two ore deposits. Furthermore, radon was found to be sensitive to soil permeability variations and to be associated with migration pathways (faults and/or fractures). Overall the results indicate the potential for using the studied gas species as <b>indicators</b> of deep <b>seated</b> ore deposits (i. e. in the Neves-Corvo mine district), even at locations where there is thick overburden and no surface evidence...|$|R
40|$|With {{emerging}} {{minimally invasive}} surgical techniques in total hip arthroplasty, {{there has been}} an increase in fractures associated with the insertion of the prosthesis into the femur. Diminished visibility necessitates a greater emphasis on the surgeon’s tactile and auditory senses to ascertain the femoral component position, ensuring maximum stability and interference fit and prevention of further component impaction and subsequent fracture of the femur. Because of the smaller incision, {{it is not possible to}} take measurements directly on the bone. Measurements must therefore be taken proximally on the femoral component. The work described in this study attempts to identify a means to supplement the surgeon’s tactile and auditory senses by using damage identification techniques normally used in civil and mechanical structures to monitor the insertion process of the prosthesis. It is hypothesized that vibration characteristics of the impact process may be used intra-operatively to determine at what position the femoral component has reached maximal interference fit and stability in the femur, referred to as “seating. ” Such information can be used to prevent further impacts and potential fracture. An ICP accelerometer was used to monitor the impact process. This paper summarizes features derived from the measured data that will be used to develop a dynamic <b>seating</b> <b>indicator...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) {{is pleased}} to provide this {{document}} to guide you in preparing the 2010 state injury indicators. Under CDC Program Announcement 05027, 28 states have been funded to collect and submit state injury indicator data; however, all states and U. S. territories are eligible to voluntarily submit data for inclusion in_the multistate State Injury Indicators Report. As more states and U. S. territories voluntarily participate in this surveillance effort, a broader picture {{of the burden of}} injuries can be presented and priorities for prevention can be targeted. During the 2009 data collection cycle, 42 states participated by submitting data for inclusion in the multistate report. We look forward to continuing our work together to advance and improve injury surveillance. The methods outlined in this document are consistent with those used in previous cycles of injury indicator data collection. These methods are based on recommendations presented in the "Consensus Recommendations for Using Hospital Discharge Data for Injury Surveillance" and in the National Public Health Surveillance System (NPHSS) indicators developed by the State and Territorial Injury Prevention Directors Association (STIPDA; now known as the Safe States Alliance) and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE). With partner feedback, CDC continuously modifies and updates the instructions and methodologies outlined in this document.
