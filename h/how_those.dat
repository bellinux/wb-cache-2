5|$|Molecular {{biology is}} the study of biology at the {{molecular}} level. This field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly those of genetics and biochemistry. Molecular biology is a study of the interactions of the various systems within a cell, including the interrelationships of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and <b>how</b> <b>those</b> interactions are regulated.|$|E
5|$|A level-number of 66 is used {{to declare}} a re-grouping of {{previously}} defined items, irrespective of <b>how</b> <b>those</b> items are structured. This data level, also referred to by the associated , is rarely used and, circa 1988, was usually found in old programs. Its ability to ignore the hierarchical and logical structure data meant its use was not recommended and many installations forbade its use.|$|E

Genetic studies are valuable due {{to their ability to}} identify molecular mechanisms and pathways for further study and potential drug targets.|$|E
5|$|The Category A listed ruined Old St Peter's Church (St. Peter's Kirk) {{is one of}} {{the older}} churches in Scotland, dated to at least 1125, and at one time it was the {{principal}} church for the county, administered by the Bishops of Caithness. The church held hearings against criminal activity and determined <b>how</b> <b>those</b> caught should be punished. In 1701, a woman who had a relationship with a Dutch sailor had her head shaved and was publicly shamed, paraded through the town by the local hangman.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Corzine, and {{managers}} including Bradley Abelow and Henri Steenkamp, appealed a court ruling relating to repayments to customers of the bankrupt brokerage. A spokesman for Mr. Corzine {{made clear that}} the appeal was not an attempt to delay payments to customers, but due to a disagreement regarding <b>how</b> <b>those</b> claims would be handled by the trustee after they were paid. Mr. Corzine fully supported customers receiving 100 percent of their money and had no desire for this to be delayed. There was nothing preventing the trustee from making full distributions immediately and litigating the appeal after the fact. Ultimately all customers were paid in full.|$|E

40|$|Based on a case, in {{this paper}} we study the {{construction}} of the image of the 19 th century bourgeois figure in a city in the coast of Argentina. We focus on Juan Canals’s business career. He was a Catalan immigrant who arrived to Rosario (province of Santa Fe) in 1870. We will look into the concepts of reputation and honorableness built from his figure, as they organized the behavior of that period, getting a particular meaning in the bourgeois world. Some of our questions ask for <b>how</b> did <b>those</b> merits influence the way the press built the image of certain businessmen who got social notoriety; <b>how</b> were <b>those</b> values perceived and defended by the actors; and <b>how</b> did <b>those</b> perceptions put in a state of tension the logics of the bourgeois universe...|$|R

5|$|In Belarus, {{the right}} to vote in {{elections}} and plebiscites is extended to those who are above the age of eighteen. During elections and plebiscites, a citizen can vote or not vote without any consequences from the government. The Constitution describes two methods of preventing a citizen from voting. First, a court can issue an order stating that the citizen does not have the mental capacity to understand and to cast a ballot. Second, a person being held in detention or confined in a prison during an election cannot cast a ballot. The Constitution says nothing about the voting rights of those who have served their prison terms, nor does it state <b>how</b> <b>those</b> citizens gain the rights back.|$|E
5|$|The {{draw that}} {{determined}} the semi-final running order {{was held on}} 25 January 2012 at the Buta Palace. The participating countries, excluding the automatic finalists (Azerbaijan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), were split into six pots, based upon <b>how</b> <b>those</b> countries voted in past contests. From these pots, half (or as close to half as possible) competed in the first semi-final on 22 May 2012. The other half in that particular pot competed in the second semi-final on 24 May 2012. This draw also acted as an approximate running order, {{in order for the}} delegations from the countries to know when their rehearsals would commence and determine which semi-final the automatic finalists would be allowed to vote in.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between genes {{can be measured}} by comparing the sequence alignment of their DNA. The degree of sequence similarity between homologous genes is called conserved sequence. Most changes to a gene's sequence do not affect its function and so genes accumulate mutations over time by neutral molecular evolution. Additionally, any selection on a gene will cause its sequence to diverge at a different rate. Genes under stabilizing selection are constrained and so change more slowly whereas genes under directional selection change sequence more rapidly. The sequence differences between genes {{can be used for}} phylogenetic analyses to study <b>how</b> <b>those</b> genes have evolved and how the organisms they come from are related.|$|E

5|$|The team's {{previous}} experience was with turn-based combat games, and it struggled {{to develop a}} real-time combat system affected by customizable attributes and abilities that provided feedback to the player on <b>how</b> <b>those</b> statistics were affecting the battle. It initially found that by adhering too closely to the White Wolf source material rules for guns, where {{the effectiveness of a}} shot is determined in a contest between the player's skill and the opponent's defense, the firearms seemed broken; the player would not hit where they aimed. Troika found it difficult to mesh the available factors in a real-time setting. Melee combat had to deal with a variety of melee weapons and animations and adjust for melee-on-melee and melee-on-ranged combat.|$|E
5|$|The rise of Fascism in {{particular}} frequently encouraged greater state involvement. In Italy, {{between the end}} of the war and 1923 local groups and organisations had established their own local memorials in villages and towns. Not all villages agreed that memorials were appropriate, either for political or religious reasons. With the Fascist revolution, this process became more centralised; veteran groups were assimilated by the Fascist government in 1926, and a systematic attempt to construct suitable national and local memorials followed. In Germany, the political and economic chaos of the immediate post-war years discouraged the construction of civic war memorials and comparatively few civic memorials in their larger towns, mainly due to the shortage of funds in the inter-war German economy and political disagreements between local groups as to what to commemorate and <b>how.</b> <b>Those</b> memorials that were constructed were often built instead by local movements, representing particular factional interests. It was only after the rise of the German Nazi party to power in 1933 that substantial funding began to flow into construction programmes, controlled from Berlin.|$|E
