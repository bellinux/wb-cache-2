5|$|I {{was told}} by my {{publishers}} that Cher heard my version and she doesn't like my new lyrics. She thinks it's too overtly sexual. But the original writers were happy <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do that—Cher didn't actually write it so she didn't get approval {{about what happened to}} the song. Now apparently she's heard what I've done and she doesn't like it.|$|E
5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E
5|$|She's so soft. She's {{beautiful}} too. I {{always tell}} her this story: When I {{was locked up}} in jail, that song 'Vision of Love' was the hottest song in the world. I used to always say, 'Man, if I could meet her!' So I worked with her, then Pharrell hooked it up <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> work with her again this time.|$|E

40|$|This {{project would}} not have been {{possible}} without the help of some key individuals. I would first like to thank Dr. Phil Jackson <b>for</b> allowing <b>me</b> <b>to</b> pursue this project and believing I could get it done. Secondly, I would like to thank the Professional Disc Golf Association for maintaining the most comprehensive source of disc golf information currently available and allowing <b>me</b> access <b>to</b> their data. I would also like to thank Bill Anderson <b>for</b> introducing <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the game of disc golf and purchasing me my first disc. Andrew Hackethorn <b>for</b> allowing <b>me</b> <b>to</b> bounce ideas off of him and work through ways of developing this project. My roommates, Chris Russo and Cory Langhoff, for all the good times we've had living at the Farm. Finally, I want to thank my girlfriend, Gretchen Williams, <b>for</b> encouraging <b>me</b> <b>to</b> get my work don...|$|R
5|$|The {{background}} vocals are {{an important}} part of the picture for me. That's why I like to do them myself a lot of the time, or initially I'll lay down the tracks. I'll double my voice or do a couple of tracks of my own voice. It's easy <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> match my voice. And then if I'm going to use other background singers, I'll let them go on top of mine.|$|E
5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go back to college with {{the same sort of}} look—the notebook paper. So it felt like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E
5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E

5|$|Basically it’s {{just about}} having a throwdown {{out in the woods}} — that’s what we used to do in high school. I can’t {{honestly}} sit here and say that I do it much anymore, I’m getting too old, but it’s fun <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> sing about those times and the crazy stuff that I used to do, and the crazy stuff that I know somewhere, as we speak right now, kids are doing somewhere in somebody's field. I know you're tearing it up out there.|$|E
5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought it was time <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have my own.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
