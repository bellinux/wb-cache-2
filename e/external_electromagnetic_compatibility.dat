40|$|This paper {{describes}} the approach developed {{in order to}} model the electromagnetic response of a cable bundle, part of the electrical wiring interconnection system of a real aircraft, submitted to an <b>external</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> excitation. The {{aim of this study}} is to highlight the main challenges in the synthetic modeling and validation of a fully real setup, from the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>compatibility</b> point of view. Both conducted and radiated excitations have been considered in the electromagnetic global model. The solution is obtained through a cooperative simulation approach involving one 3 -D full-wave solver and a multiconductor transmission line solver. The results are compared with measurements and specific tools, such as feature selective validation and integrated error against log frequency, are used to assess the adequacy of the result...|$|R

With the rapid developments {{of computer technology}} and computing electromagnetism, {{it is possible to}} simulate the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>compatibility</b> of automobiles. At the beginning of the design, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>compatibility</b> simulation analysis of automobiles can not only shorten the research cycle, but also reduce the cost. In this paper, we summarized the current commercial <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>compatibility</b> simulation analysis software, analyzed the features and applied algorithms of each software, and gave the simulation examples of Ansoft HFSS and FEKO...|$|R
