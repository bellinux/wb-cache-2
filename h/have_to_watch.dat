It also offered fans the option of {{a ticket to}} any future Super Bowl, along with round-trip airfare and hotel accommodations. However, this wasn't enough to mollify several fans, who on February 9 filed a $5 million class-action lawsuit against the NFL, the Cowboys and Jones. In addition to Steelers and Packers fans left without seats, the suit includes Cowboys fans who paid $100,000 for personal seat licenses, only to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the Super Bowl in metal folding chairs without a view of the stadium's giant video replay board. The NFL at first offered $2,400 to fans who did not receive a replacement seat, but later offered tickets to a future Super Bowl with airfare and hotels included.|$|E

25|$|Wild Seed is {{the story}} of two immortal Africans named Doro and Anyanwu. Doro is a spirit who can take over other people’s bodies, killing anyone and {{anything}} in his path, while Anyanwu is a woman with healing powers who can transform herself into any human or animal. When they meet, Doro senses Anyanwu’s abilities and wants to add her to one of his seed villages in the New World, where he breeds super humans.

By partnering Anyanwu and Isaac together, Doro hopes to obtain children with very special abilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{cable network}} {{was able to}} provide a wider library of films for Best Brains to riff from. To assure {{that they would be}} able to produce a funny episode, at least one member of the staff would watch the {{suggested}} films completely, generally assuring that the movie would be prime for jokes throughout; Conniff stated that he often would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> twenty films in their entirety before selecting one to use for the show. In one specific case, the second-season episode with the film Sidehackers, they had only skimmed the first part of the movie before making the decision to use it, and only later discovering that it contained a rape scene. They decided to stay committed to the film, but cut out the offending scene and had to explain the sudden absence of the affected character to the audience. After that point, they carefully scrutinized entire films, and once one was selected and assured the rights, committed to completing the episode with that film. Obtaining the rights was handled by the cable networks. Some licensing required buying film rights in packages, with the selected bad movies included in a catalog of otherwise good films, making the negotiations odd since the network was only interested in the bad film. Other times, the rights to the film were poorly documented, and the network would follow the chain of custody to locate the copyright owner as to secure broadcast rights.|$|E

500|$|... "I Am Your Leader" [...] is a {{hardcore}} {{hip-hop and}} electro-hop song that runs {{for three minutes}} and thirty-three seconds. The production consists of a [...] "chilled-out, humming beat punctuated on the chorus with a blunted fake-horn hook—halfway between classic-era Neptunes and Look At Me Now" [...] according to Andrew Unterberger of Popdust. It also contains repetitive, high-pitched, off-pitch synth hooks, and a booming, static bass. [...] "I Am Your Leader" [...] makes use of sparse beats, frills, minimal instrumentation, and allows Minaj’s rhymes to be the focal point, all of which gives the song [...] "something of a mixtape feel" [...] according to Joe Rivers of No Ripcord. In his review of the song, Unterberger of Popdust noted Hit-Boy's modern hip hop production, saying [...] "Diplo and Bangladesh might <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> their back after the up-and-comers contributions to this album." [...] Adam Fleischer of XXL said [...] "Nicki dishes boast-heavy verses about how she’s better than all these other bitches." ...|$|E
500|$|However, not all reviews were as positive. Robert Abele of LA Weekly {{thought the}} pilot was average, {{containing}} [...] "fashionable gore, occasionally witty dialogue, serviceable suspense and boilerplate police-department politics". Abele felt that the series was a superhero tale, rather than the dark comedy, police thriller and brooding drama that it was promoted to be. Brian Lowry of Variety {{did not think that}} Dexter would impress critics, and noted, [...] "antics of the deranged... aren't really all that pleasant to watch", but praised Hall's acting saying that he [...] "... quickly dispatches any thoughts of his [...] "Six Feet" [...] character, which, by itself, represents quite an accomplishment." [...] Nancy DeWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal felt that the [...] "grotesqueries of Dexter are not something that can easily be dismissed with the old 'you don't have to watch' line.

500|$|The vocal {{tracks were}} taped in Britannia Row and Protocol studios between May and June 1991. This {{was the first}} time vocalist Bilinda Butcher was {{involved}} in the recording. Shields and Butcher hung curtains on the window between the studio control room and the vocal booth, and only communicated with the engineers when they would acknowledge a good take by opening the curtain and waving. According to engineer Guy Fixsen, [...] "We weren't allowed to listen while either of them were doing a vocal. You'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the meters on the tape machine to see if anyone was singing. If it stopped, you knew you had to stop the tape and take it back to the top." [...] On most days, the couple arrived without having written the lyrics for the song they were to record.

The Pac-10 schools wanted him to walk-on, rather than be actively recruited or offered a sports scholarship. Harvard and Brown were the only teams that guaranteed him a spot on their basketball teams, but Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships. Rex Walters, University of San Francisco men's basketball coach and retired NBA player, said NCAA limits on coaches' recruiting visits had reduced Lin's chances. [...] "Most colleges start recruiting a guy in the first five minutes they see him because he runs really fast, jumps really high, does the quick, easy thing to evaluate," [...] Walters said. Lin added, [...] "I just think in order for someone to understand my game, they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> me more than once, because I'm {{not going to do anything}} that's extra flashy or freakishly athletic." ...|$|E
500|$|Saadiq's songwriting is {{characterized}} by straightforward romanticism, positive exhortations, pining ballads, and message songs. Christgau interpreted Saadiq's persona on the album to be [...] "a romantic who stays true to the deliberate simplicity" [...] of the song titles, but [...] "never threatens to assume the fetal position if he doesn't get the extreme cuddling he craves." [...] Patrick Varine of the Observer-Dispatch asserted that Saadiq deviates significantly from contemporary R lyrics: [...] "there are no thinly-veiled food-sex metaphors or pimp fantasies". His songwriting also paraphrases classic soul lyrics and, on the album's slower songs, expresses tightly coiled emotions. Saadiq said that some songs were written about his life experiences. He described the album as [...] "basically a series of love songs about music, how falling in love can be easy, but staying true to it can be tricky." [...] He elaborated on this interpretation in an interview for the Chicago Tribune: [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> out for those curves. [...] music comes out, {{and how do you}} stay true to what you love? I’m not saying everything has to sound like a '60s record to stay true, but you should never take the relationship lightly." ...|$|E
