25|$|In {{management}} literature, <b>gap</b> <b>analysis</b> {{involves the}} comparison of actual performance with potential or desired performance. If an organization {{does not make the}} best use of current resources, or forgoes investment in capital or technology, it may produce or perform below its potential.

25|$|A <b>gap</b> <b>analysis</b> {{can also}} be used to compare one process to others {{performed}} elsewhere, which are often identified through benchmarking. In this usage, one compares each process side-by-side and step-by-step and then notes the differences. One then analyzes each deviation to determine if there is any benefit to changing to the alternate process. The results of this analysis (in the context of the benefits and detriments of changing processes) may support the maintenance of the current process, the wholesale adoption of an alternate process, or a fusion of different aspects of each process.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{interest}} {{in the use of}} naturally occurring substances of botanical origin as livestock feed additives has increased significantly. Before any additive can be marketed it must undergo a rigorous scientific evaluation to demonstrate both its safety and its efficacy under Regulation (EC) No 1831 / 2003. EFSA has been re-evaluating all feed additives currently on the market, authorised under the previous regulatory framework such that they are harmonised with the current regulation. As part of this work, EFSA issued a tender to procure support for this re-evaluation process as there was a need to consider the completeness of data submissions related to substance identity and description, physico-chemical properties, purity and manufacturing processes. This involved examining the data required for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 429 / 2008 and for compliance with EFSA guidance to form a data checklist. Twenty dossiers, containing 268 botanical preparations, were then analysed against this checklist. This involved extracting data for each botanical preparation and using this to populate a database. Bespoke software was then used to perform a <b>gaps</b> <b>analysis</b> and to generate a summary data sheet for each preparation. The summary data sheet and <b>gaps</b> <b>analysis</b> report were then submitted to EFSA. The variability in the data provided in the dossiers for all 268 botanical preparations are well reflected in the summary data sheets. Those gaps and inconsistencies in the identity and characterisation may impact on data to be provided in other sections. There is scope to improve the consistency of scientific data reporting and presentation throughout the characterisation and identity section of the dossier...|$|R

Although API STAPH ID 20, a commercially available identification system, and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of the gap gene (gap PCR-RFLP) have been successfully applied for the identification of CNS isolates from human specimens, their accuracy {{in the identification of}} veterinary isolates has not been fully established. In this study, we identified 263 CNS isolates from bovine IMI at species level by partial 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis as the definitive test. Species identification obtained using partial 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis was compared to results from the API STAPH ID 20 and <b>gap</b> PCR-RFLP <b>analysis.</b> Eleven different CNS species were identified by partial 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Only 76. 0 % (200 / 263) of the species identification results obtained by API STAPH ID 20 matched those obtained by partial 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis, whereas 97. 0 % (255 / 263) of the species identification results obtained by the <b>gap</b> PCR-RFLP <b>analysis</b> matched those obtained by partial 16 S rRNA gene sequence <b>analysis.</b> The <b>gap</b> PCR-RFLP <b>analysis</b> could be a useful and reliable alternative method for the species identification of CNS isolates from bovine IMI and appears to be a more accurate method of species identification than the API STAPH ID 20 system...|$|R

40|$|Industrial {{automation}} {{and control}} systems are increasingly deployed using wireless networks in master-slave, star-type configurations that employ a slotted timeline schedule. In this paper, the scheduling of (re) transmissions to meet real-time constraints {{in the presence}} of non-uniform interference in such networks is considered. As packet losses often occur in correlated bursts, it is often useful to insert gaps before attempting retransmissions. In this paper, a quantum Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling framework entitled ‘Eligible EDF’ is suggested for assigning (re) transmissions to available timeline slots by the master node. A simple but effective server strategy is introduced to reclaim unused channel utilization and replenish failed slave transmissions, a strategy which prevents cascading failures and naturally introduces retransmission <b>gaps.</b> <b>Analysis</b> and examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, the proposed framework gives a timely throughput of 99. 81 % of the timely throughput that is optimally achievable using a clairvoyant scheduler...|$|R
40|$|Fragmented ocean {{management}} contributes {{significantly to}} the declining health of the world’s oceans. The sector-based piecemeal approach to management has produced a governance system filled with gaps and overlaps. These inefficiencies impede effective mitigation and confrontation of major environmental stressors. Historically, industries such as mining, fishing, and shipping, have driven management decisions for ocean-related uses. Government agencies, scientists, and other natural resource stakeholders are moving toward a management approach based on the relevant ecosystem, in order to resolve problematic fragmentation in ocean management. Transitioning into an ecosystem-based management approach requires comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the problems created by fragmented decision-making and of {{the landscape of the}} current governance system. In an effort to contribute to the shift toward ecosystem-based management efforts, this dissertation explores and develops text mining techniques that identify and evaluate gaps and overlaps. Two institutional theories frame the development of gaps and overlaps analyses: the problem of fit and institutional interplay, respectively. The <b>gaps</b> <b>analysis</b> uses conceptual ecosystem models and term counts from laws to identify situations in which management fails to acknowledge ecosystem relationships. From the <b>gaps</b> <b>analysis,</b> two measures indicate the degree to which governance (referring to the whole cross sectoral system of law) reflects the relationships and functionality of the ecosystem it aims to manage. The overlaps analysis uses term counts of laws combined with agency authority data to provide information about potential hubs of regulatory activity for a given topic (Overlap Index), and the degree of agency involvement in a particular topic. To develop such techniques, the project first compiled a comprehensive set of state and federal statutes and regulations to represent ocean and coastal management in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. This dissertation also highlights the utility of analyses {{in the context of a}} real world environmental problem by presenting a case study applying the analyses to ocean acidification and its projected impacts on the California Channel Islands waters. Overall, this dissertation demonstrates the immense application potential of computer science to provide baseline data about fragmented ocean management. This dissertation shows that text mining can provide a quantitatively and systematically generated starting point for further investigation and identifying research priorities...|$|R
