During his tenure the institution took an increasingly active role in local affairs {{as part of the}} national system. McCabe leaned toward decentralization and away from the highly centralized philosophy that marked the federal government during the previous 15 years. His philosophy was in a strong local government. He felt that without healthy local business units there could be no overall national strength. McCabe called for cooperation between management, labor, and government as it means to combat inflation. He urged a cut in the federal debt as a step that should precede tax reduction, and he leaned toward a policy of credit contraction and saving as primary means of curtailing the <b>inflation</b> <b>spiral.</b> He was intensely interested in extending aid to foreign nations, being administered by one man who would report directly to the President. McCabe thought that the unification of American, British and French commands in Europe were necessary to rehabilitate Europe after World War II.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the possibility that}} <b>spiral</b> <b>inflation</b> can be realized using the near-conifold flux potentials for the complex structure moduli in type IIB string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold. Using the explicit form of the flux potential for complex structure moduli, we provide analytical and numerical arguments showing that <b>spiral</b> <b>inflation</b> is difficult to support. We also show that for this sector of low energy string theories, a viable spiral inflationary scenario would owe its success to a de Sitter-like vacuum energy, with minimal reliance on the non-gradient flow field trajectories which characterize <b>spiral</b> <b>inflation.</b> We thus conclude {{that even though the}} near conifold region has the requisite multi-sheeted potential called for by <b>spiral</b> <b>inflation,</b> generically it appears that <b>spiral</b> <b>inflation</b> is not realized using the complex structure flux potential alone.

40|$|Abstract. Several {{central banks}} in the world perform their policy in a gradual way, moving their {{reference}} rate in small doses to get some cumulative tight-ening or easing of the policy. This paper addresses gradualism in monetary policy through a model with uncertainty and strategic interactions. After ana-lyzing the question of gradualism in Colombia through a modified Taylor rule, we calibrate the model using Colombian data and find that monetary policy effectiveness is associated with higher inflation expectations, so central banks should be less gradual when the regime of monetary policy is effective to tackle an <b>inflation</b> <b>spiral</b> swiftly...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper offers}} a new {{theoretical}} framework for linking inflation and accumulation, with the Israeli experience as a case study. The focal point {{is the process of}} differential accumulation by the largest core firms. The theory of differential accumulation suggests that the relative power of these firms can be augmented either through ‘breadth’ (relative employment) or ‘depth’ (relative profit per employee). In the Israeli case, inflation accelerated since the 1970 s when the large core firm began shifting their emphasis from breadth to depth. The paper examines the political economic conditions typical to each of these regimes, why these conditions changed in Israel, and how the distributive gains of the core firms pushed the country onto the brink of hyperinflation. It then articulates the inherent limits of a ‘depth’ regime, why Israel reached those limits during the early 1980 s, and how this brought the <b>inflation</b> <b>spiral</b> to an end...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores various {{facets of}} the low-energy solutions in string theory known as the string landscape. Three separate questions are addressed - the tunneling dynamics between these vacua, the statistics of their location in moduli space, and the potential realization of slow-roll inflation in the flux potentials generated in string theory. We find that the tunneling transitions that occur between a certain class of supersymmetric vacua {{related to each other}} via monodromies around the conifold point are sensitive to the details of warping in the near-conifold regime. We also study the impact of warping on the distribution of vacua near the conifold and determine that while previous work has concluded that the conifold point acts as an accumulation point for vacua, warping highly dilutes the distribution in precisely this regime. Finally we investigate a novel form of <b>inflation</b> dubbed <b>spiral</b> <b>inflation</b> to see if it can be realized near the conifold point. We conclude that for our particular models, <b>spiral</b> <b>inflation</b> seems to rely on a de Sitter-like vacuum energy.

50|$|Second, the {{collapse}} of the KMT regime can in part be attributed to the government's economic policies, which triggered capital flight among the businessmen who had been the KMT's strongest supporters. The cotton textile industry was the leading sector of Chinese industry, but in 1948, shortages of raw cotton plunged the industry into dire straits. The KMT government responded with an aggressive control policy that directly procured cotton from producers to ensure a sufficient supply and established a price freeze on cotton thread and textiles. This policy failed because of resistance from cotton textile industrialists, who relocated textile facilities and capital to Hong Kong or Taiwan around the end of 1948 and early 1949 when prices soared and <b>inflation</b> <b>spiraled</b> out of control.

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} conduct of {{monetary}} policy, in a simple new Keynesian model, with adaptive learning {{on the part of}} the private sector. A key feature is that even though we start out with a linear â€œstructuralâ€ model, the system and hence policy responses inherit the non-linear feature of the updating equations for the estimated parameters. In the paper, we contrast two different monetary policy regimes. In the first the central bank follows a simple rule, which comes from the first order conditions, for optimal policy under discretion in the case of rational expectations. In the second, the central bank has full information about the structure of the economy, including the adaptive learning mechanism. It takes the expectations formation mechanism explicitly into account when deriving optimal policy. This framework allows an explicit discussion of the importance of keeping inflation expectations under control. We illustrate with an application to a regime change, where we assume that the incumbent policymaker did not take the learning into account and allowed the expectation formation process to become unhinged. However, before inflation expectations (and actual <b>inflation)</b> <b>spirals</b> out of control, we assume that a sophisticated central banker, who does take the effect of learning into account, takes charge and study how the economy adjusts after the regime change. Under our assumptions the transition is slow. We claim that some features of the transition match important stylised facts associated with the Volcker disinflation in the US. In the end the fully optimal policy delivers less inflation and output gap volatility. It does so by anchoring inflation expectations thereby contributing to the overall stability of the economy. To achieve this result optimal policy is conditional on the degree of perceived persistence. As perceived persistence increases so does inertia in the policy response in the face of inflation shocks. We compare the contrast between the two policy regimes in the paper with the difference between the rational expectations under discretion and commitment. monetary policy, adaptive learning, regime change...|$|R
