5|$|Risk parity is a {{conceptual}} approach to investing which attempts {{to provide a}} lower risk and lower fee alternative to the traditional portfolio allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds which carries 90% of its risk in the stock portion of the portfolio (see illustration). The risk parity approach attempts to equalize risk by allocating funds to {{a wider range of}} categories such as stocks, government bonds, credit-related securities and inflation hedges (including real assets, commodities, real estate and inflation-protected bonds), while maximizing gains through financial leveraging. According to Bob Prince, CIO at Bridgewater Associates, the defining parameters of a traditional risk parity portfolio are uncorrelated assets, low <b>equity</b> <b>risk,</b> and passive management.|$|E

2500|$|The Build-Up Method is {{a widely}} {{recognized}} method of determining the after-tax net cash flow discount rate, which in turn yields the capitalization rate. The figures used in the Build-Up Method are derived from various sources. This method is called a [...] "build-up" [...] method {{because it is the}} sum of risks associated with various classes of assets. It is based on the principle that investors would require a greater return on classes of assets that are more risky. The first element of a Build-Up capitalization rate is the risk-free rate, which is the rate of return for long-term government bonds. Investors who buy large-cap equity stocks, which are inherently more risky than long-term government bonds, require a greater return, so the next element of the Build-Up method is the <b>equity</b> <b>risk</b> premium. In determining a company's value, the long-horizon <b>equity</b> <b>risk</b> premium is used because the Company's life is assumed to be infinite. The sum of the risk-free rate and the <b>equity</b> <b>risk</b> premium yields the long-term average market rate of return on large public company stocks.|$|E

40|$|Given {{the growing}} {{importance}} of securitisation to financial stability, {{it is surprising}} that empirical studies {{on the role of the}} US structured finance market in the recent crisis have been relatively sparse. To fill this gap, this thesis studies the US structured finance market (tracked by the ABX indices) and addresses various important research questions specific to the recent 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. First, I contribute to the contagion literature by extending Longstaff’s (2010) investigation to an international market perspective. Evidence of contagion from the ABX indices to the G 5 international equity and government bond markets via the funding illiquidity and credit risk channels during the subprime crisis is documented. Second, I formulate a multifactor model with crisis interaction effects and document significant increases in the ABX AAA factor loadings during the subprime crisis, which is consistent with contagion. My cross-sectional pricing tests show that the ABX AAA factor significantly explains the cross-section of expected returns during the subprime crisis; that is, the impact of contagion on the US equity market was reasonably systematic. I compute a simple statistic that gauges the degree of the stocks’ exposure to the ABX innovations in each month and find that the exposure spiked in February, July and October 2007 and in February, July and November 2008. Third, I investigate whether the US bank holding companies’ fundamental characteristics determine bank <b>equity</b> <b>risks</b> during the recent crisis. I depart from prior studies and consider bank <b>equity</b> <b>risks</b> relating to the banks’ exposure to the ABX innovations, the asset-backed money market and the market wide default risk in a variance decomposition. My study establishes the link between the banks’ fundamental and <b>equity</b> <b>risks,</b> and shows that banks’ regulatory capital requirement is an effective means to limit banks’ exposure to systemic risks in relation to funding illiquidity. Lastly, I document compelling evidence of quarterly bank stock return predictability based on variables relating to banks’ profitability, loan asset credit quality, capital adequacy and <b>equity</b> <b>risks</b> over the 2006 to 2011 period. By studying the turnover ratios and order flows, I show that bank stocks with weaker fundamentals and smaller size were traded more intensely in the following quarter while the higher trading activity was dominated by selling pressure. The evidence lends support to my ‘fire sale’ or ‘flight-to-safety’ hypothesis and reveals that the banks’ fundamental variables and size were the major criteria used by investors in formulating their ‘flight’ decisions during the recent crisi...|$|R

Although dispersive equity has long been recognized as an important component of some policy decisions, it has received little formal treatment within the matrix of salient factors for such decisions. Our purpose is to advance its formal development. This is done within a formulation based on probability distributions over potential fatality sets. The formulation gives rise to four distinct but not independent <b>equity</b> concepts: individual <b>risk</b> <b>equity,</b> group <b>risk</b> <b>equity,</b> dispersive equity, and social outcome equity.
