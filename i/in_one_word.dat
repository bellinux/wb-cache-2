25|$|Problematic point(s):, linguistically speaking, {{these do}} not {{constitute}} an actual compound (because the meaning is not institutionalized), {{so there is no}} sound reason for writing them <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>word.</b> In addition, the normal alternative for writing <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>word</b> is writing with hyphens, rather than writing separately, so this opposition is unusual in Hungarian orthography.|$|E
25|$|Problematic point(s): {{there are}} more than fifty phrases written <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>word</b> only after one single derivational suffix (e.g. partra száll ’disembark’ but partraszállás ’disembarkation’).|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the {{original}} {{meaning of the}} adjective is retained, but the whole compound still means something more specific {{than the sum of}} the elements. For example, savanyú káposzta, lit. ’sour cabbage’, actually ’sauerkraut’, is more than a cabbage that tastes sour: it means a type of pickled food, yet it is written with a space. On the other hand, mobiltelefon ’mobile phone’ is written <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>word,</b> although it is actually a telephone that is mobile – writing <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>word</b> may be justified by the different technology, as distinguished from a cordless telephone, which is also portable.|$|E

25|$|A {{separate}} {{group of}} compounds with subordinated elements {{is the one}} named literally “meaning-condensing” or “meaning-compressing” compounds, which have a more complex internal structure, containing implicit elements outside the constituting words, or sometimes where the present meaning cannot be derived at all from the elements. They are always written <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>word,</b> e.g. csigalépcső ’spiral staircase,’ lit. “snail-staircase”, i.e. a staircase similar to the shell of snails.|$|E
25|$|Apart from single-element names, country {{names with}} -ország, -föld, -alföld or -part (‘country’, ‘land’, ‘plain’, ‘coast’) and most regions are written <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>word,</b> {{as well as}} Hungarian {{settlements}} and their districts (“towns”) and quarters, and even Hungarian names outside Hungary. The adjective-forming suffix -i (sometimes -beli) is attached directly to the name. If it already ends in -i, this ending is not repeated.|$|E

McKenzie does not, however, formulate precise definitions, he only "illustrates the performative aspect of speaking through one’s own special, iterative speech about oneself (about <b>one’s</b> <b>words</b> and <b>in</b> <b>one’s</b> <b>words)</b> "...|$|R

25|$|If a {{fraction}} {{functions as a}} noun, the quantifier is written separately (e.g. egy negyed ‘one quarter’). However, if {{a fraction}} takes an adjectival role in a phrase, the two parts are written <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>word</b> (e.g. egynegyed rész ‘a one-quarter part’). Giving the hour is also done by this rule. The integer part of a decimal is divided from the rest by a comma (e.g. 3,14 ‘3.14’).|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} two questions about geographical names {{is whether a}} name should be written <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>word,</b> with hyphens, or in separate words, and which elements should be written uppercase and lowercase. Different written forms may refer to different entities, e.g. Sáros-patak lit. ‘muddy river’ refers to a river, but Sárospatak refers to a city (because rivers’ names are written with a hyphen, but city names are written as one word). This field {{is considered one of}} the most complex parts of Hungarian orthography, so a separate volume was published about it, and a separate board (Földrajzinév-bizottság) working in the Ministry of Agriculture is entitled to give statements. It consists of experts in linguistics, education, transportation, hidrology, natural protection, public administration, ethnic minorities, foreign relations, and other fields.|$|E
25|$|Abbreviations {{are written}} <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>word</b> {{whether they are}} created from single nouns, nouns with derivational suffixes, or compounds, and they are written with a full stop. If an {{abbreviation}} retains {{the ending of the}} original word, the full stop is still preserved (e.g. pság. < parancsnokság ‘headquarters’). Abbreviation of phrases normally contains as many elements as the original phrase contains (e.g. s. k. < saját kezével ‘by his/her own hand’) but there are exceptions (e.g. vö. < vesd össze ‘compare’). Case is usually kept in abbreviations (e.g. Mo. < Magyarország ‘Hungary’) but some abbreviations created from lowercase words use the uppercase (e.g. Ny < nyugat ‘west’). Units of measurement are used in accordance with the international standard, depending on whether the sign comes from a common name (m < méter) or a proper name (N < newton after Isaac Newton). Standard forms of abbreviations are not to be altered even in full-capitalized inscriptions (ÁRA: 100 Ft ‘PRICE: 100 HUF’).|$|E

25|$|Verbal prefixes (cf. Vorsilben in German) {{are only}} written {{together}} with the verb they belong to if they immediately precede that verb. If the same verbal prefix is repeated to express repeated action, the first is divided by a hyphen, the second is written <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>word</b> (meg-megáll ’keep stopping once in a while’). If two verbal prefixes with an opposite meaning follow each other, both are written separately (le-föl sétál ’walk up and down’). Verbal prefixes may be written separately if {{the meaning of the}} prefix is stressed and the prefix is meant in a literal sense, but they must be written as one word if the meaning is changed (e.g. fenn marad ’stay upstairs’ but fennmarad ’survive, remain’). Some verbal prefixes coincide with adverbs that can have personal endings. In this case, they can only be written as one word if they are in the third person plural and the prefix/adverb is not stressed on its own (especially if the meaning is changed). Otherwise (if another person is used and/or the prefix/adverb is stressed) they should be written in two words.|$|E
25|$|Problematic point(s): the {{resulting}} very long words {{are difficult to}} comprehend, so instead of rephrasing them, people tend to write them separately. In addition, it is debated whether these forms occasionally written <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>word</b> should be allowed, because this form only shows the highest relationship {{at the expense of}} an easy-to-read overview of the other parts. (One of the OH. authors, Attila Mártonfi noted: the inscription forgalmi rend változás ‘change in traffic regulations’ is easier to read if written in three words rather than the regular form created with the mobility rules, forgalmirend-változás.) Sometimes this rule is ignored even in the title of linguistic books, such as Magyar nyelvtörténet (‘Hungarian historical linguistics,’ lit. “Hungarian language history”), which should be written Magyarnyelv-történet, to reflect that it is not historical linguistics in Hungarian language, but the historical linguistics of the Hungarian language. It may also cause problems when the involved elements are proper names, such as Nap–Föld-távolság ‘Sun–Earth distance,’ because the dashes and hyphens follow a different rule in this case (see the part on punctuation).|$|E
500|$|The {{importance}} of rehearsal to Monteux was shown when, in 1923, Diaghilev {{asked him to}} conduct Stravinsky's new Les noces with no rehearsal, as the composer would already have conducted the first performance, Monteux following on from there. Monteux told the impresario [...] "Stravinsky, 'e can do what 'e like, but I {{have to do what}} ze composer 'as written." [...] Monteux's self-effacing approach to scores led to occasional adverse comment; the music critic of The Nation, B. H. Haggin, while admitting that Monteux was generally {{regarded as one of the}} giants of conducting, wrote of his [...] "repeatedly demonstrated musical mediocrity". [...] Other American writers have taken a different view. In 1957 Carleton Smith wrote, [...] "His approach to all music is that of the master-craftsman. ... Seeing him at work, modest and quiet, it is difficult to realize that he is a bigger box office attraction at the Metropolitan Opera House than any prima donna ... that he is the only conductor regularly invited to take charge of America's 'big three'– the Boston, Philadelphia and New York Philharmonic orchestras." [...] In his 1967 book The Great Conductors, Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Monteux, [...] " [...] conductor of international stature, a conductor admired and loved all over the world. The word 'loved' is used advisedly." [...] Elsewhere, Schonberg wrote of Monteux's [...] "passion and charisma". When asked in a radio interview to describe himself (as a conductor) <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>word,</b> Monteux replied, [...] "Damned professional".|$|E
