5|$|Carnotaurus is {{the only}} known {{carnivorous}} bipedal animal {{with a pair of}} horns on the <b>frontal</b> <b>bone.</b> The use of these horns is not entirely clear; several interpretations have revolved around use in fighting conspecifics, in display, or in killing prey.|$|E
5|$|Three of the skulls {{displayed}} {{evidence that}} they had experienced violence; a probable adult female had an unhealed injury on the left <b>frontal</b> <b>bone,</b> an adult of indeterminate sex had an unhealed fracture on the left frontal, and a second adult female had a healed depressed fracture on the right frontal.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of sirenians {{is characterized by}} the appearance of several traits, which are found in all sirenians (monophyly). The nostrils are large and retracted, the upper-jaw bone contacts the <b>frontal</b> <b>bone,</b> the sagittal crest is missing, the mastoid fills the supratemporal fenestra (an opening {{on the top of the}} skull), a drop-like ectotympanic (a bony ring that holds the ear drum), and pachyosteosclerotic (dense and bulky) bones.|$|E

5|$|The nasal {{openings}} {{were large}} and faced frontwards. The nasal bone was thick, heavily sculpted, {{and had a}} convex profile. It formed a boss (shield) on the middle top of the skull together with the <b>frontal</b> <b>bone.</b> The lower front of the premaxilla (front bone of the upper jaw) was rugose and thickened. A small foramen (hole) was present in the suture between the premaxillae, leading into the nasal cavity, and possibly connected to the Jacobson's organ (an olfactory sense organ). The maxilla was short and deep, and probably contained a sinus. The maxilla {{had a series of}} foramina that corresponded with each tooth position there, and these functioned as passages for erupting replacement teeth. The mandible articulated with the skull below the back of the orbit. The tooth-bearing part of the lower jaw was long, with the part behind being rather short. Though not preserved, the presence of a predentary bone is indicated by facets {{at the front of the}} lower jaw. Like other pachycephalosaurs, it would have had a small beak.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} the dodo {{differed}} much {{from those of}} other pigeons, especially in being more robust, the bill having a hooked tip, and in having a short cranium compared to the jaws. The upper bill was nearly {{twice as long as}} the cranium, which was short compared to those of its closest pigeon relatives. The openings of the bony nostrils were elongated {{along the length of the}} beak, and they contained no bony septum. The cranium (excluding the beak) was wider than it was long, and the <b>frontal</b> <b>bone</b> formed a dome-shape, with the highest point above the hind part of the eye sockets. The skull sloped downwards at the back. The eye sockets occupied much of the hind part of the skull. The sclerotic rings inside the eye were formed by eleven ossicles (small bones), similar to the amount in other pigeons. The mandible was slightly curved, and each half had a single fenestra (opening), as in other pigeons.|$|E
5|$|These minks {{were large}} and heavily built, {{with a low}} {{sagittal}} crest and short, wide postorbital processes (projections on the <b>frontal</b> <b>bone</b> behind the eye sockets). In fact, the most notable characteristic of the skull was its size, {{in that it was}} clearly larger than that of other mink species, having a wide rostrum, large nostril openings, large antorbital fenestrae (openings in the skull in front of the eye socket), and large teeth. Their large size was probably in response to their coastal environment, as the largest extant subspecies of American mink, the Alaskan mink (N. v. nesolestes), inhabits the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska, an area with a habitat similar to the Gulf of Maine. Mead, concluding that the mink was restricted to nearshore islands, suggested that the large size was due to insular gigantism. Since almost all members of the subfamily Mustelinae exhibit sexual dimorphism, male sea minks were probably larger than female sea minks. The sea mink's wider carnassial teeth and blunter carnassial blades suggest that they crushed hard shells more often than did the teeth of the American mink.|$|E
50|$|The <b>frontal</b> <b>bones</b> {{are very}} wide. The occipito-nasal length {{generally}} exceeds 85 mm. There {{is no clear}} notch in front of postorbital processes.|$|R
50|$|Quadrate {{longer than}} supratemporal; maxillary {{much longer than}} quadrate, nearly {{straight}} in front of prefrontal; a large vacuity between the <b>frontal</b> <b>bones</b> and the basisphenoid: Coelopeltis.|$|R
5000|$|If the suture is {{not present}} at birth because both <b>frontal</b> <b>bones</b> have fused (craniosynostosis), it will cause a keel-shaped {{deformity}} of the skull called [...] "trigonocephaly".|$|R
5|$|The {{skull of}} Nemegtomaia was deep, narrow, and short (compared {{to the rest}} of the body), and reached 179mm (7in) in length. It had a {{well-developed}} crest, formed by the nasal and premaxilla bones (mainly the latter) of the snout. The nearly vertical front margin of the crest formed an almost 90degree angle with the upper margin of the skull. Compared to other oviraptorids, the nasal processes (projections) of the premaxillae were barely visible when viewed from above (where they connected with the nasal bones on the highest points of the crest). The crest extended hindwards and down, forming a round arch at the highest point. The diameter of the orbit (eye opening) was 52mm (2in); the eyes looked large due to the shortness of the skull. The antorbital cavity in front of the eye consisted of two fenestrae (openings); a large antorbital fenestra at the back, and a small maxillary fenestra at the front. Nemegtomaia was distinct from other oviraptorids in that the <b>frontal</b> <b>bone</b> on the midline of the skull was about 25% the length of the parietal bone from front to back. The nares (external nostrils) were relatively small and placed high on the skull.|$|E
5|$|P. xinjiangensis is {{distinguished}} by a prominent jugal 'horn' that is flattened {{on the front}} end, {{as well as some}} features of the teeth. The ilium, one of the three bones of the pelvis, also bears a characteristically long bony process behind the acetabulum (hip socket). An adult femur has a published length of about 16centimetres (6.3in). P. meileyingensis has the shortest snout and neck frill of any species, making the skull nearly circular in profile. The orbit (eye socket) is roughly triangular, and there is a prominent flange on the lower edge of the dentary, a feature also seen in specimens of P. lujiatunensis, and to a lesser degree in P. mongoliensis, P. sattayaraki, and P. sibiricus. The complete type skull, probably adult, is 13.7centimetres (5.5in) long. The dentary of P. sattayaraki has a flange similar to that found in P. mongoliensis, P. sibiricus, P. lujiatunensis and P. meileyingensis, although it is less pronounced than in those species. The material appears to be roughly the same size as P. sinensis. The <b>frontal</b> <b>bone</b> of P. neimongoliensis is distinctly narrow compared to that of other species, resulting in a narrower skull overall. The ischium bone of the pelvis is also longer than the femur, which differs from other species in which these bones are known. The type specimen has a skull length of 13.2centimetres (5.2in) and a femoral length of 13centimetres (5.1in), but is not fully grown. An adult P. neimongoliensis was probably smaller than P. mongoliensis, with a proportionately longer skull and tail. P. ordosensis can be distinguished by numerous features of the jugals, which have very prominent 'horns'. It is also the smallest known species. One adult skull measures only 9.5centimeters (3.75in) in length.|$|E
25|$|A form {{of surgery}} is the {{so-called}} fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling. Firstly, the supraorbital bar is remodelled by a wired greenstick fracture to straighten it. Secondly, the supraorbital bar is moved 2cm. forward and fixed only to the frontal process of the zygoma without fixation to the cranium. Lastly, the <b>frontal</b> <b>bone</b> is divided into two, rotated and attached to the supraorbital bar causing a nude area (craniectomy) between the parietal bone and <b>frontal</b> <b>bone.</b> Bone will eventually regenerate since the dura mater lies underneath (the dura mater has osteogenic capabilities). This results in an advancement and straightening of the forehead.|$|E

50|$|The {{skull of}} a baby {{consists}} of five main bones: two <b>frontal</b> <b>bones,</b> two parietal bones, and one occipital bone. These are joined by fibrous sutures, which allow movement that facilitates childbirth and brain growth.|$|R
50|$|The human skull is {{generally}} considered to consist of twenty-two bonesâ€”eight cranial bones and fourteen facial skeleton bones. In the neurocranium these are the occipital bone, two temporal bones, two parietal bones, the sphenoid, ethmoid and <b>frontal</b> <b>bones.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{northern}} Rocky Mountain wolf (Canis lupus irremotus) is a subspecies of {{gray wolf}} {{native to the}} northern Rocky Mountains. It is a light-colored, medium to large-sized subspecies with a narrow, flattened <b>frontal</b> <b>bone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Further finds {{from the}} Mauer sand mine are the Hornstein artefacts, {{unearthed}} in 1924 by Karl Friedrich Hormuth, which scholars interpreted as tools of Homo heidelbergensis. In 1933 Wilhelm Freudenberg discovered a <b>frontal</b> <b>bone</b> fragment which {{has also been}} associated with Homo heidelbergensis.|$|E
25|$|The {{so-called}} â€˜floating forehead techniqueâ€™ {{combined with}} the remodelling of the supraorbital bar {{is derived from the}} fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling. The supraorbital bar is remodelled as described above. The <b>frontal</b> <b>bone</b> is split in two pieces. Instead of using both pieces as in fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling, only one piece is rotated and attached to the supraorbital bar. This technique also leaves a craniectomy behind.|$|E
5000|$|Two smaller fontanelles {{are located}} {{on each side of}} the head, more {{anteriorly}} the sphenoidal or anterolateral fontanelle (between the sphenoid, parietal, temporal, and <b>frontal</b> <b>bones)</b> and more posteriorly the mastoid or posterolateral fontanelle (between the temporal, occipital, and parietal bones).|$|R
50|$|Porotic {{hyperostosis}} {{is characterized}} by porous lesions on the parietal, occipital, and sometimes <b>frontal</b> <b>bones.</b> Cribra orbitalia is another pathological skeletal lesion that manifests as porosity on the orbital roof. Both porotic hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia are indicators of a nutritional deficiency that leads to anemia.|$|R
5000|$|Skull bossing is the {{protuberance}} {{of various}} {{bones of the}} skull which most often occurs in the <b>frontal</b> <b>bones</b> beneath the forehead. Skull bossing {{may be due to}} a variety of medical conditions such as when a decrease in bone marrow volume leads to depressed intramedullary hematopoiesis.|$|R
25|$|The wombat's incisors {{resemble}} those of rodents, and its molars are widely spaced by the palate. The teeth keep growing for {{the entirety of the}} animalâ€™s life, which is likely an adaptation to its harsh diet. Compared to the common wombat, the southern hairy-nosed wombat has a larger temporalis muscle and a smaller masseter muscle. Also, unlike the northern hairy-nosed wombat, the southern hairy-nosed wombatâ€™s nasal bone is longer than the <b>frontal</b> <b>bone.</b>|$|E
25|$|The nasal {{lining of}} the distal two-thirds of the nose can be covered with {{anteriorly}} based septal mucosal flaps; however, if bilateral septal-flaps are used, the septal cartilage does become devascularized, possibly from iatrogenic septal perforation. Furthermore, if the nasal defect is beyond the wound-correction scope of a septal mucosal flap, the alternative techniques are either an inferiorly based pericranial-flap (harvested from the <b>frontal</b> <b>bone)</b> or a free flap of temporoparietal fascia (harvested from the head), either {{of which can be}} lined with free grafts of mucosa to achieve the nasal reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|The base of skull {{was found}} intact. The {{back of the}} skull cavity {{contains}} the shrunken and desiccated brain and dura mater of the Lady. There {{is no evidence of}} embalming material within the cranial cavity. Researchers located an oval defect in the skull. It is located in {{the central part of the}} <b>frontal</b> <b>bone,</b> in front of the coronal suture. The defect has sharp, beveled, and festooned edges. The lack of evidence for attempted healing or sclerosis indicate that the defect was caused by a postmortem alteration of the body, probably during the embalming process. The embalmers likely used a sharp instrument on the skull.|$|E
50|$|The postorbital bar {{is where}} the {{zygomatic}} <b>bone</b> and the <b>frontal</b> <b>bones</b> join to form a lateral strut which runs around the eye socket of most strepsirrhine primates and some other mammals, such as the hyrax. This {{is in contrast to}} the haplorhine primates, which have evolved fully enclosed sockets.|$|R
30|$|Epidermoid cysts {{are lined}} with {{squamous}} epithelium and contain remnants of cholesterol and keratin. Intradiploic epidermoid cysts can occur {{in any part of}} the skull, but most commonly occur laterally in the parietal and <b>frontal</b> <b>bones.</b> They are usually discovered in patients between 20 and 50 Â years of age [1, 2, 6].|$|R
50|$|Its {{presence}} in a fetal skull, along with other cranial sutures and fontanelles, provides a malleability to the skull that can facilitate movement of the head through the cervical canal and vagina during delivery. The dense connective tissue found between the <b>frontal</b> <b>bones</b> is replaced with bone tissue as the child grows older.|$|R
25|$|In {{the upper}} {{portion of the}} nose, the paired nasal bones attach to the <b>frontal</b> <b>bone.</b> Above and to the side (superolaterally), the paired nasal bones connect to the {{lacrimal}} bones, and below and to the side (inferolaterally), they attach to the ascending processes of the maxilla (upper jaw). Above and to the back (posterosuperiorly), the bony nasal septum is composed of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone. The vomer bone lies below and to the back (posteroinferiorly), and partially forms the choanal opening into the nasopharynx, (the upper portion of the pharynx that is continuous with the nasal passages). The floor of the nose comprises the premaxilla bone and the palatine bone, {{the roof of the}} mouth.|$|E
25|$|Derived ichthyosaurs in {{the narrow}} sense, as defined by Motani in 1999, differ from their closest basal ichthypterygian {{relatives}} in certain traits. Motani listed a number of these. The external nostril {{is located on the}} side of the skull, and is hardly visible from above. The upper rim of the eye socket consists of a bone bar formed by the prefrontal and the postfrontal bones. The postorbital in side view is excluded from the supratemporal fenestra. The opening for the parietal eye is located on the border of the parietal and the <b>frontal</b> <b>bone.</b> The lateral wing of the pterygoid is incompletely and variably ossified. The ulna lacks the part behind the original shaft axis. The rear dorsal vertebrae are disc-shaped.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 study {{established}} eight unique derived traits or autapomorphies {{in which}} Scipionyx differed from its closest relatives. The praemaxilla has five teeth. Where the parietal and the <b>frontal</b> <b>bone</b> make contact, the depression {{in which the}} supratemporal fenestra, a skull roof opening, was present, shows a sinuous ridge on the postorbital. The lower branch of the squamosal has a rectangular end. The wrist consists of just two, superimposed, bones: a radial and a lower element formed by a fusion {{of the first and}} second carpal. This last element has the shape of a lens, not a crescent; is flattened; and is fused seamlessly. The first finger is conspicuously elongated, 23% longer than the third finger. The notch in the front edge of the ilium is directed to the front and only weakly developed. The front edge of the ischium shaft has a long obturator process with a rectangular end.|$|E
25|$|Trigonocephaly (Greek: 'trigonon' = triangle, 'kephale' = head) is a {{congenital}} {{condition of}} premature fusion of the metopic suture (Greek: 'metopon' = forehead) {{leading to a}} triangular shaped forehead. The merging of the two <b>frontal</b> <b>bones</b> leads to transverse growth restriction and parallel growth expansion. It may occur syndromic involving other abnormalities or isolated.|$|R
2500|$|Sinosaurus is {{the only}} [...] "dilophosaurid" [...] known from a {{complete}} braincase. Cryolophosaurus, Dilophosaurus, Zupaysaurus and Coelophysis kayentakatae are all known from partial braincases. Two partial braincases were found before 2012, and are probably mostly complete, except that large sections are obscured by sediments. In 2011, an exceptionally well-preserved braincase was found, only missing the <b>frontal</b> <b>bones</b> and orbitosphenoid.|$|R
