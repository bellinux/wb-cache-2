5|$|Psoriasis has {{a strong}} {{hereditary}} component, and many genes are associated with it, but {{it is unclear how}} those genes work together. Most of the identified genes relate to the immune system, particularly the major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex (MHC) and T cells. Genetic studies are valuable due to their ability to identify molecular mechanisms and pathways for further study and potential drug targets.|$|E
5|$|Rodents use scent marking in {{many social}} {{contexts}} including inter- and intra-species communication, the marking of trails {{and the establishment}} of territories. Their urine provides genetic information about individuals including the species, the sex and individual identity, and metabolic information on dominance, reproductive status and health. Compounds derived from the major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex (MHC) are bound to several urinary proteins. The odor of a predator depresses scent-marking behavior.|$|E
5|$|The major {{determinant}} is PSORS1, {{which probably}} accounts for 35%–50% of psoriasis heritability. It controls genes {{that affect the}} immune system or encode skin proteins that are overabundant with psoriasis. PSORS1 is located on chromosome 6 in the major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex (MHC), which controls important immune functions. Three genes in the PSORS1 locus have a strong association with psoriasis vulgaris: HLA-C variant HLA-Cw6, which encodes a MHC class I protein; CCHCR1, variant WWC, which encodes a coiled protein that is overexpressed in psoriatic epidermis; and CDSN, variant allele 5, which encodes corneodesmosin, a protein which is expressed in the granular and cornified layers of the epidermis and upregulated in psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} for unfolding of globular proteins is necessarily general, but somewhat {{dependent on the}} amino acid sequence. Long sequences of alternating glycine and alanine {{have been shown to}} inhibit substrate unfolding, decreasing the efficiency of proteasomal degradation; this results in the release of partially degraded byproducts, possibly due to the decoupling of the ATP hydrolysis and unfolding steps. Such glycine-alanine repeats are also found in nature, for example in silk fibroin; in particular, certain Epstein–Barr virus gene products bearing this sequence can stall the proteasome, helping the virus propagate by preventing antigen presentation on the major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex.|$|E
5|$|The parasite/host {{relationship}} probably {{drove the}} prevalence of sexual reproduction over the more efficient asexual reproduction. It seems that when a parasite infects a host, sexual reproduction affords {{a better chance of}} developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving sexual reproduction variability for fitness not seen in the asexual reproduction, which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite. Coevolution between host and parasite may accordingly be responsible for much of the genetic diversity seen in normal populations, including blood-plasma polymorphism, protein polymorphism, and <b>histocompatibility</b> systems.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{genes that}} have been linked with MS include {{differences}} in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system—a group of genes on chromosome 6 {{that serves as the}} major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex (MHC). That changes in the HLA region are related to susceptibility has been known since the 1980s, and additionally this same region has been implicated in the development of other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes type I and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most consistent finding is the association between multiple sclerosis and alleles of the MHC defined as DR15 and DQ6. Other loci have shown a protective effect, such as HLA-C554 and HLA-DRB1*11. Overall, {{it has been estimated that}} HLA changes account for between 20 and 60% of the genetic predisposition. Modern genetic methods (genome-wide association studies) have discovered at least twelve other genes outside the HLA locus that modestly increase the probability of MS.|$|E

25|$|This is {{the genetic}} {{background}} against which scientists tried to uncover {{and understand the}} <b>histocompatibility</b> antigens.|$|E
25|$|The domains have binding regions for the Major <b>Histocompatibility</b> Complex Class II (MHC Class II) and the T cell {{receptor}} (TCR), respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{genes of}} the major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex (MHC) are highly polymorphic, and this {{diversity}} plays {{a very important role}} in resistance to pathogens. This is true for other species as well.|$|E
25|$|The major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex (MHC) {{is a set}} of cell surface {{proteins}} {{essential for}} the acquired immune system to recognize foreign molecules in vertebrates, which in turn determines <b>histocompatibility.</b> The main function of MHC molecules is to bind to antigens derived from pathogens and display them on the cell surface for recognition by the appropriate T-cells. MHC molecules mediate interactions of leukocytes, also called white blood cells (WBCs), which are immune cells, with other leukocytes or with body cells. The MHC determines compatibility of donors for organ transplant, as well as one's susceptibility to an autoimmune disease via crossreacting immunization. The human MHC is also called the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) complex (often just the HLA). The mouse MHC is called the H-2 complex or H-2.|$|E
25|$|Immune {{genes are}} {{expanded}} in macaques, relative to all four great ape species. The macaque genome has 33 major <b>histocompatibility</b> genes, three times those of human. This has clinical significance because the macaque {{is used as}} an experimental model of the human immune system.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Hood {{was among}} the first to study, at the gene level, the MHC (major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex) gene family and the T-cell {{receptor}} gene families as well as being among first to demonstrate that alternative RNA splicing was a fundamental mechanism for generating alternative forms of antibodies. He showed that RNA splicing is the mechanism for generating the membrane bound and the secreted forms of antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Immunogens can be {{targeted}} to various cellular compartments to improve antibody or cytotoxic T-cell responses. Secreted or plasma membrane-bound antigens {{are more effective}} at inducing antibody responses than cytosolic antigens, while cytotoxic T-cell responses can be improved by targeting antigens for cytoplasmic degradation and subsequent entry into the major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex (MHC) class I pathway. This is usually accomplished {{by the addition of}} N-terminal ubiquitin signals.|$|E
25|$|Once the plasmid inserts {{itself into}} the {{transfected}} cell nucleus, it codes for a peptide string of a foreign antigen. On its surface cell the displays the foreign antigen with both <b>histocompatibility</b> complex (MHC) classes I and class II molecules. The antigen-presenting cell then travels to the lymph nodes and presents the antigen peptide and costimulatory molecule signaled by T-cell, initiating the immune response.|$|E
25|$|To explain {{rejection}} in a nutshell, certain {{immune system}} components are highly variable, the agents {{are called the}} Major <b>histocompatibility</b> (MHC) antigens. MHC antigens cause rejection of improperly matched organ transplants. The variability stems from genetics. From the perspective of human evolution, why are antigens of the MHC so variable when many other human proteins lack variability? The cause of host-versus-graft-disease may actually stem from {{the functions of the}} system.|$|E
25|$|Born on 4 November 1949 in Amritsar, in the Indian {{state of}} Punjab, Mehra did his {{schooling}} at Bishop Cotton School, Simla and earned his graduate degree (BSc) with human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry as optional subjects from Government Medical College, Amritsar in 1969 {{before moving to}} Delhi to complete his master's degree (MSc) in human anatomy at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. He continued at AIIMS for his doctoral studies and after securing a PhD in 1975 on the immunology of leprosy, he did post-doctoral work on <b>histocompatibility</b> and immunogenetics at the laboratory of Jon van Rood in the Netherlands and later with John A. Hansen at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle. On his return to India, he joined his alma mater, AIIMS, as a pool officer in 1977, where he served out his career, serving as a professor from 1993 onward. In 1979, he was elevated to lecturer with the additional responsibility of the clinical and research activities of the <b>Histocompatibility</b> Laboratory established under the Department of Anatomy in 1977, the year he joined AIIMS. In 1993, the laboratory, which served as the core laboratory in India for workshops on <b>histocompatibility</b> {{as well as a}} base for researches on human leukocyte antigen (HLA), was upgraded to a full-fledged department under the name, the Department of Transplant Immunology and Immunogenetics, and he headed the department as its founding chair. He also served as the member secretary of the Research Advisory Council and chaired the Dean’s Research Committee (DRC) at AIIMS. At the time of superannuation in 2004, he was serving as the Dean of Research and post-retirement, he holds the Dr. C.G. Pandit National Chair of the Indian Council of Medical Research at AIIMS, continuing his research at the institution.|$|E
25|$|CD4+ helper T cells: T cells {{displaying}} co-receptor CD4 {{are known}} as CD4+ T cells. These cells have T-cell receptors and CD4 molecules that, in combination, bind antigenic peptides presented on major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex (MHC) class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells. Helper T cells make cytokines and perform other functions that help coordinate the immune response. In HIV infection, these T cells are the main index to identify the individual's immune system integrity.|$|E
25|$|Human {{leucocyte}} antigen (HLA) polymorphisms {{common in}} West Africans but rare in other racial groups, {{are associated with}} protection from severe malaria. This group of genes encodes cell-surface antigen-presenting proteins and has many other functions. In West Africa, they account for as great a reduction in disease incidence as the sickle-cell hemoglobin variant. The {{studies suggest that the}} unusual polymorphism of major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex genes has evolved primarily through natural selection by infectious pathogens.|$|E
25|$|It {{was known}} before the genomic era that {{clustered}} genes {{tend to be}} functionally related. Abderrahim et al. (1994) had shown that all the genes of the major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex were clustered on the 6p21 chromosome. Roy et al. (2002) showed that in the nematode C. elegans genes that are solely expressed in muscle tissue during the larval stage tend to cluster in small groups of 2–5 genes. They identified 13 clusters.|$|E
25|$|In both TSS (caused by S. aureus) and TSLS (caused by S. pyogenes), disease {{progression}} {{stems from a}} superantigen toxin that allows the nonspecific binding of MHC II with T-cell receptors, resulting in polyclonal T-cell activation. In typical T-cell recognition, an antigen is taken up by an antigen-presenting cell, processed, expressed on the cell surface in complex with class II major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex (MHC) in a groove formed by the alpha and beta chains of class II MHC, and recognized by an antigen-specific T-cell receptor.|$|E
25|$|The All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi {{established}} a <b>Histocompatibility</b> Laboratory under its Department of Anatomy in 1977, the year Mehra joined as a pool {{officer at the}} institution. Subsequently, {{he took over the}} activities of the laboratory {{and by the time he}} was promoted to professor in 1993, the laboratory had developed into referral centre as well as a core laboratory for <b>histocompatibility</b> workshops and AIIMS elevated its status to an independent department, the Department of Transplant Immunology and Immunogenetics, with Mehra as its founding chair. Under the aegis of the new department and in association with Dadhichi Deh Dan Samiti, he established the first Asian Indian Donor Marrow Registry (AIDMR), a database of the donors of bone marrow in India in 1994 and serves as its president. He would later explain the details of the registry through an article, Asian Indian donor marrow registry: All India Institute of Medical Sciences experience, published in Transplantation Proceedings in 2007. He has delivered a number of keynote addresses or invited lectures including MedIndia 2003 2013 seminar of human genomics at the Guru Nanak Dev University, 2016 India-Japan Regulatory Symposium, and a Guest lecture series organized by Manipur University in 2016. He has also mentored around 60 masters and doctoral research scholars in their studies.|$|E
25|$|The CYP21A2 {{gene for}} the P450c21 enzyme (also known as 21-hydroxylase) is at 6p21.3, amid genes HLA B and HLA DR coding {{for the major}} human <b>histocompatibility</b> loci (HLA). CYP21A2 is paired with a {{nonfunctional}} pseudogene CYP21A1P. Scores of abnormal alleles of CYP21A2 have been documented, most arising from recombinations of homologous regions of CYP21A2 and CYP21A1P. Differences in residual enzyme activity of the various alleles account for the various degrees of severity of the disease. Inheritance {{of all forms of}} 21-hydroxylase CAH is autosomal recessive.|$|E
25|$|Diversity of antigen presentation, {{mediated}} by MHC classes I and II, is attained {{in at least}} three ways: (1) an organism's MHC repertoire is polygenic (via multiple, interacting genes); (2) MHC expression is codominant (from both sets of inherited alleles); (3) MHC gene variants are highly polymorphic (diversely varying from organism to organism within a species). Major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex and sexual selection has been observed in male mice making mate choices of females with different MHCs and thus demonstrating sexual selection. Also, at least for MHC I presentation, there has been evidence of antigenic peptide splicing which can combine peptides from different proteins, vastly increasing antigen diversity.|$|E
25|$|The E5 are small, very {{hydrophobic}} {{proteins that}} destabilise {{the function of}} many membrane proteins in the infected cell. The E5 protein of some animal papillomavirus types (mainly bovine papillomavirus type 1) functions as an oncogene primarily by activating the cell growth-promoting signaling of platelet-derived growth factor receptors. The E5 proteins of human papillomaviruses associated to cancer, however, seem to activate the signal cascade initiated by epidermal growth factor upon ligand binding. HPV16 E5 and HPV2 E5 have {{also been shown to}} down-regulate the surface expression of major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex class I proteins, which may prevent the infected cell from being eliminated by killer T cells.|$|E
25|$|Fungal {{immunomodulatory}} proteins (FIPs) are bioactive ingredients within genera Ganoderma {{that have}} immune building properties. FIPs stimulate different cells and cellular components that enable immune response. Some of the molecules and cells that FIPs influence include T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages, and regulation of human monocyte DCs. Improved function of these cells will promote cytokine expression such as IL2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma which will support lymphocyte proliferation, immune cell initiation, and tumor inhibiting factors. Immunostimulation from FIPs could cause increased expression of costimulatory molecules and major <b>histocompatibility</b> complexes (MHC) which help {{to create a}} pathway for immune response to take place.|$|E
25|$|The {{genetic locus}} most {{significantly}} associated with primary SS is the major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex/human leukocyte antigen (MHC/HLA) region, {{as demonstrated by the}} preliminary results of the first genome-wide association study (GWAS). This GWAS included data from a discovery cohort of 395 patients of European ancestry with primary SS, and 1,975 healthy control individuals, and from a replication study that comprised 1,234 cases and 4,779 healthy controls. Associations with polymorphisms located at six independent loci were also detected; IRF5, STAT4, BLK, IL12A, TNIP1, and CXCR5. This also suggested the activation of the innate immune system, notably through the IFN system, B-cell activation through CXCR5-directed recruitment to lymphoid follicles and B-cell receptor (BCR) activation involving BLK, and T-cell activation owing to HLA susceptibility and the IL-12-IFN-γ-axis.|$|E
25|$|Narinder Kumar Mehra (born 4 November 1949) is an Indian immunologist, {{professor}} and the founding {{head of the}} department of transplant immunology and immunogenetics of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. He is a former dean of research and holds the ICMR Dr. C.G. Pandit National Chair at AIIMS. An elected fellow of the International Medical Sciences Academy, The World Academy of Sciences, Indian National Science Academy and National Academy of Sciences, India, Mehra is known for his research on <b>histocompatibility</b> and immunogenetics. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Medical Sciences in 1992. He received the Chevalier of the National Order of Merit from François Mitterrand in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Other {{similarities}} {{include the}} immunological {{memory of the}} adaptive immune system in vertebrates and the observation that a similar collective memory (operating with a yet-to-be-explained mechanism) occurs in some insect societies e.g. individual Z. angusticollis survive M. anisopliae infections significantly more when {{they have been in}} contact with a previously infected conspecifc, a 'social transfer of immunity' or 'social vaccination'. Transplant rejection caused by non-self major <b>histocompatibility</b> complexes is frequently thought to be a byproduct with no evolutionary function, however Cremer cites cases (such as the colonial star ascidian (Botryllus schlosseri)) where recognizing foreign cells may have evolved as an adaptation - if so, then this could be analogous to the self-recognition systems in social insects which prevent brood parasitism and the worker policing behaviours which suppress 'social tumours'. Specific immune cells in animals 'patrol' tissues looking for parasites, as do worker-caste individuals in colonies.|$|E
25|$|Mehra is the {{founding}} {{president of the}} Federation of Immunological Societies of Asia Oceania (FIMSA) and has served as its vice president thereafter. He was also the organizer the Advanced Course on Basic and Translational Immunology of conducted by FIMSA {{in collaboration with the}} International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) and Indian Immunology Society (IIS) in March 2012; he has also served {{as a member of the}} council of IUIS. He presides over the Indian Society of <b>Histocompatibility</b> and Immunogenetics and was a faculty of the 2016 edition of ISHICON held in December 2016 at Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.

500|$|Major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex, {{peptides}} also {{implicated in}} individual recognition in mice ...|$|E
500|$|The major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex (MHC) {{is a large}} genomic region {{found in}} most {{vertebrates}} {{that is associated with}} the immune system. It is located on chromosome 6 in humans. A subset of MHC in humans is human leukocyte antigen (HLA), which controls the antigen-presenting system, as part of adaptive immunity against pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. When human cells are infected by a pathogen, some of them can present parts of the pathogen's proteins on their surfaces; this is called [...] "antigen presentation". The infected cells then become targets for types of cytotoxic T-cells, which kill the infected cells so they can be removed from the body.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1950s, Frank Burnet, {{inspired}} by a suggestion made by Niels Jerne, formulated the clonal selection theory (CST) of immunity. On the basis of CST, Burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self/nonself distinction: [...] "self" [...] constituents (constituents of the body) do not trigger destructive immune responses, while [...] "nonself" [...] entities (pathogens, an allograft) trigger a destructive immune response. The theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding <b>histocompatibility</b> or the complex [...] "two-signal" [...] activation of T cells. The self/nonself theory of immunity and the self/nonself vocabulary have been criticized, but remain very influential.|$|E
500|$|... 20S proteasomes {{can also}} {{associate}} {{with a second}} type of regulatory particle, the 11S regulatory particle, a heptameric structure that does not contain any ATPases and can promote the degradation of short peptides but not of complete proteins. It is presumed that {{this is because the}} complex cannot unfold larger substrates. This structure is also known as PA28 or REG. The mechanisms by which it binds to the core particle through the C-terminal tails of its subunits and induces α-ring conformational changes to open the 20S gate suggest a similar mechanism for the 19S particle. The expression of the 11S particle is induced by interferon gamma and is responsible, in conjunction with the immunoproteasome β subunits, for the generation of peptides that bind to the major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex.|$|E
500|$|After {{recognizing}} an antigen, an {{antigen presenting cell}} such as the macrophage or B lymphocyte engulfs {{it completely}} by a process called phagocytosis. The engulfed particle, along with some material surrounding it, forms the endocytic vesicle (the phagosome), which fuses with lysosomes. Within the lysosome, the antigen is broken down into smaller pieces called peptides by proteases (enzymes that degrade larger proteins). The individual [...] peptides are then complexed with major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex class II (MHC class II) molecules located in the lysosome– this method of [...] "handling" [...] the antigen {{is known as the}} exogenous or endocytic pathway of antigen processing in contrast to the endogenous or cytosolic pathway, which complexes the abnormal proteins produced within the cell (e.g. under the influence of a viral infection or in a tumor cell) with MHC class I molecules.|$|E
500|$|Both B {{cells and}} T cells carry {{receptor}} molecules that recognize specific targets. T cells recognize a [...] "non-self" [...] target, {{such as a}} pathogen, only after antigens (small fragments of the pathogen) have been processed and presented in combination with a [...] "self" [...] receptor called a major <b>histocompatibility</b> complex (MHC) molecule. There are two major subtypes of T cells: the killer T cell and the helper T cell. In addition there are regulatory T cells which [...] {{have a role in}} modulating immune response. Killer T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class I MHC molecules, while helper T cells and regulatory T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class II MHC molecules. These two mechanisms of antigen presentation reflect the different roles of the two types of T cell. A third, minor subtype are the γδ T cells that recognize intact antigens that are not bound to MHC receptors.|$|E
