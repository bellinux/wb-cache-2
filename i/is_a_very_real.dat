2500|$|Equipment failure rarely causes {{fatalities}} and injuries. Approximately one in 750 deployments of a {{main parachute}} {{result in a}} malfunction. Ram-air parachutes typically spin uncontrollably when malfunctioning, and must be jettisoned before deploying the reserve parachute. [...] Reserve parachutes are packed and deployed differently; they are also designed more conservatively and built and tested to more exacting standards so they are more reliable than main parachutes, but the real safety advantage comes from the probability of an unlikely main malfunction multiplied by the even less likely probability of a reserve malfunction. This yields an even smaller probability of a double malfunction although {{the possibility of a}} main malfunction that cannot be cutaway causing a reserve malfunction <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> risk.|$|E

2500|$|In 2017, {{a report}} by the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) found that the {{previous}} year, 2016, had been the worst on record for antisemitic hate crime in the UK. Prior to that, 2015 had been the worst year on record, and 2014 was the worst year on record before that. The report found that in 2016, antisemitic crime rose by 15% compared to 2015, or 45% compared to 2014. It also found that 1 in 10 antisemitic crimes was violent. Despite rising levels of antisemitic crime, the report said there had been a decrease in the charging of antisemitic crime. In the report's foreword, the CAA's Chairman wrote: [...] "Britain has the political will to fight antisemitism and strong laws with which to do it, but those responsible for tackling the rapidly growing racist targeting of British Jews are failing to enforce the law. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> danger of Jewish citizens emigrating, as has happened elsewhere in Europe unless there is radical change." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, a Tumblr post from user virjn {{generated}} media controversy, as it claimed Green is [...] "a creep who panders to {{teenage girls}} {{so that he}} can amass some weird cult-like following." [...] Other users commented on the post, criticizing his writing and tagging Green to bring the post to his attention. Green responded to the post, defending himself, stating, [...] "Throwing that kind of accusation around is sick and libelous and most importantly damages the discourse around the actual sexual abuse of children." [...] Green added that he would use the social media website less often, stating, [...] "I'm not angry or anything like that. I just need some distance for my well-being." [...] Fellow young-adult authors, Rainbow Rowell and Maggie Stiefvater came to Green's defense. Stiefvater wrote on Tumblr, [...] "You can have your own opinions on Green's books and Internet presence, {{but the fact remains that}} he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> positive influence on thousands of teens. You're not just making sure you can't have nice things. You're taking away other people's nice things." [...] In a subsequent email to USA Today, Stiefvater stated, [...] "I had to say something. Not because of the nature of the posts, although they were distasteful and borderline libel. But because the grotesquerie was being force-fed to the author." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s, {{the term}} [...] "experimental" [...] was often applied by {{conservative}} music critics—along {{with a number}} of other words, such as [...] "engineers art", [...] "musical splitting of the atom", [...] "alchemist's kitchen", [...] "atonal", and [...] "serial"—as a deprecating jargon term, which must be regarded as [...] "abortive concepts", since they did not [...] "grasp a subject" [...] This was an attempt to marginalize, and thereby dismiss various kinds of music that did not conform to established conventions [...] In 1955, Pierre Boulez identified it as a [...] "new definition that makes it possible to restrict to a laboratory, which is tolerated but subject to inspection, all attempts to corrupt musical morals. Once they have set limits to the danger, the good ostriches go to sleep again and wake only to stamp their feet with rage when they are obliged to accept the bitter fact of the periodical ravages caused by experiment." [...] He concludes, [...] "There {{is no such thing as}} experimental music … but there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> distinction between sterility and invention" [...] Starting in the 1960s, [...] "experimental music" [...] began to be used in America for almost the opposite purpose, in an attempt to establish an historical category to help legitimize a loosely identified group of radically innovative, [...] "outsider" [...] composers. Whatever success this might have had in academe, this attempt to construct a genre was as abortive as the meaningless namecalling noted by Metzger, since by the [...] "genre's" [...] own definition the work it includes is [...] "radically different and highly individualistic" [...] It is therefore not a genre, but an open category, [...] "because any attempt to classify a phenomenon as unclassifiable and (often) elusive as experimental music must be partial" [...] Furthermore, the characteristic indeterminacy in performance [...] "guarantees that two versions of the same piece will have virtually no perceptible musical 'facts' in common" [...]|$|E

[...] The more serious cases are carried in doolies or litters, protected from the sun by white curtains, and borne by four natives. Those who are well enough ride on mules.

It is very much like this, I think, with regard to the subject which you were just then discussing. Faith, from our point of view, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> and psychical force.

It was, by all accounts, mainly {{responsible}} for {{the downfall of the}} An Fu party in the summer of 1920. This party was pro-Japanese and was accepting loans from Japan. Hatred of Japan is the strongest and most widespread of political passions in China, and it was stirred up by the students in fiery orations. The An Fu party had, at first, a great preponderance of military strength; but their soldiers melted away when they came to understand the cause for which they were expected to fight. In the end, the opponents of the An Fu party were able to enter Peking and change the Government almost without firing a shot.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the case}} of the psychics, they are, of course, {{delineated}} exactly as they appeared to me, although I have concealed their real names and places of residence. Mrs. Smiley, whose admirable patience under investigation makes her an almost ideal subject, is the chief figure among my [...] "mediums," [...] and I have tried to give her attitude toward us and toward her faith as she expressed it in our sittings, although the conversation is necessarily a mixture of imagination and memory. Mrs. Hartley <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> and vigorous character--a professional psychic, it is true, but a woman of intelligence and power. Those in private life I have guarded with scrupulous care, and I am sure that none of them, either private or professional, will feel that I have wilfully misrepresented what took place. My aim throughout has been to deal directly and simply with the facts involved.|$|E

The curse <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> thing--and it would not be fair to you. Now I can save enough from the wreck to start us without positive hardship over seas, and George has written offering me a small share in his Australian cattle-run.

6000|$|This {{philosophical}} {{freedom from}} all resentment, this strange love of truth which seems actually {{to come through}} carelessness, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> piece of spiritual observation. Even among liars there are two classes, one immeasurably better than another. The honest liar {{is the man who}} tells the truth about his old lies; who says on Wednesday, [...] "I told a magnificent lie on Monday." [...] He keeps the truth in circulation; no one version of things stagnates in him and becomes an evil secret. He does not have to live with old lies; a horrible domesticity. Mr. Swiveller may mislead the waiter about whether he has the money to pay; but he does not mislead his friend, and he does not mislead himself on the point. He is quite as well aware as any one can be of the accumulating falsity of the position of a gentleman who by his various debts has closed up all the streets into the Strand except one, and who is going to close that to-night with a pair of gloves. He shuts up the street with a pair of gloves, but he does not shut up his mind with a secret. The traffic of truth is still kept open through his soul.|$|E
60|$|The {{tyranny of}} the {{majority}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>real</b> danger. It {{is a mistake to}} suppose that the majority is necessarily right. On every new question the majority is always wrong at first. In matters where the state must act as a whole, such as tariffs, for example, decision by majorities is probably the best method that can be devised. But there are a great many questions {{in which there is no}} need of a uniform decision. Religion is recognized as one of these. Education ought to be one, provided a certain minimum standard is attained. Military service clearly ought to be one. Wherever divergent action by different groups is possible without anarchy, it ought to be permitted. In such cases it will be found by those who consider past history that, whenever any new fundamental issue arises, the majority are in the wrong, because they are guided by prejudice and habit. Progress comes through the gradual effect of a minority in converting opinion and altering custom. At one time--not so very long ago--it was considered monstrous wickedness to maintain that old women ought not to be burnt as witches. If those who held this opinion had been forcibly suppressed, we should still be steeped in medieval superstition. For such reasons, it is of the utmost importance that the majority should refrain from imposing its will as regards matters in which uniformity is not absolutely necessary.|$|E

2500|$|Residential {{development}} of the Wainuiomata Valley had been happening only for about a decade when, in 1963, the New Zealand Geological Survey prepared a report for the Wellington City Council on options for a Wainuiomata rail link for consideration for a regional plan for Greater Wellington.
