40|$|To {{study the}} amount of arsenic {{emission}} from the coal power stations (mainly Permo-Carboniferous coal) in China in different combustion conditions. the arsenic content of the coal. the fly ash and the cinder in high-temperature power stations as well as mid-low temperature power stations have been analyzed. This note provides a rough estimate of {{the total amount of}} arsenic emission as well as emission ratio from steam coal combustion in China. The results show that by combustion of 1 t of Permo-Carboniferous coal (containing roughly 5 mg/kg arsenic), high-temperature power stations emit roughly 0. 40 g arsenic into the atmosphere and the arsenic emission rate is about 7. 70 %: mid-low power stations emit roughly 0. 15 g arsenic into the atmosphere and the arsenic emission rate is about 2. 97 %. a total of 600 million tons coal is burnt annually in China power stations. and the coal comes mainly from Permo-Carboniferous depositing in the North China Plate and northwest China coal mines. Taking the average arsenic content of the coal used at the value of 5 mg/kg. the total annual arsenic emission from steam coal combustion into the atmosphere is about 195. 0 t. Most of the arsenic in coal can be released in the process of coal combustion. and the most of the released arsenic can be seized by the fly ash and then both of them are seized by the <b>dust</b> <b>catcher</b> of power station. so the arsenic emission ratio to the atmosphere is declined: in addition. research on the arsenic emission amount and emission rules from the coal power stations in China should go on the coal power stations with the dry-process dust catchers by the experiments results. In the wet process of <b>dust</b> <b>catcher.</b> 20 % of the arsenic in the fly ash is dissolved in the water of sedimentation tank in high-temperature power station: in the mid-low temperature power station there are 70 % of the arsenic in the fly ash dissolved in the water of sedimentation tank, this is an important source of arsenic pollution in environment and should not be overlooked. The arsenic emission rate in the process of coal cineration in the laboratory is higher than the actual arsenic emission rate of power station...|$|E
40|$|Building and {{enclosure}} walls and/or wall construction units contain openings for ventilation and exhaust. In {{some cases}} the admission of fresh air or heat dissipation requires a conditioning of air and additional fans for sufficient transportation rates. With demands for noise control the openings reduce the sound-insulating effect of the wall construction units substantially. In order to prevent the direct acoustic break out and to create areas for damping means in the sound transmission path at the same time, the openings are connected with labyrinth systems in shape of consecutive bends and changes in cross-section, for example. The labyrinth distance reached by this is usually clearly larger than the actual wall thickness. Since also aerodynamic requirements are to be fulfilled and hidden cavities in wall construction units represent ideal dirt and <b>dust</b> <b>catcher,</b> these aspects must be treated together with the acoustic optimization. One shortcoming of all these passive means is their poor performance at low frequencies. This {{gives rise to the}} employment of active resonator systems which can add substantial attenuation especially at the low frequencies and require only short installation distances. Experimental data, acoustic computation possibilities for labyrinth systems and their linkage with the respective wall construction unit are presented...|$|E

30|$|The <b>dust</b> <b>catchers</b> {{that are}} used in {{underground}} coal mines can be classified, {{on the basis of the}} dedusting mechanisms that they employ, as filtering, centrifugal separation and comprehensive systems (Colinet et al. 2005; Black et al. 2007; Shorokhov et al. 2009; Koo et al. 2010; Faschingleitner and Hoflinger 2011; Torano et al. 2011; Konorev and Nesterenko 2012; Li et al. 2013). In Germany, fibre bag precipitators are usually adopted in underground coal mines because of their high dust collection efficiency. However, they are very bulky. In Poland, cyclone dust collectors have a large share of the market. They bear advantages of a collection efficiency of up to 99.3  % and a dewatering efficiency of up to 98  %. Their disadvantages lie in an operating resistance of over 2, 300  Pa and an even greater bulk than fibre bag precipitators.|$|R
40|$|Wind tunnel {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the efficiency of sediment samplers designed to measure the deposition of aeolian dust. Efficiency was ascertained relative to a water surface, which was considered the best alternative for simulating a perfectly absorbent surface. Two types of samplers were studied: the Marble Dust Collector (MDCO) and the inverted frisbee sampler. Four versions of the latter catcher were tested: an empty frisbee, an empty frisbee surrounded by an aerodynamic flow deflector ring, a frisbee filled with glass marbles, and a frisbee filled with glass marbles and surrounded by a flow deflector ring. Efficiency was ascertained for five wind velocities (range: 1 - 5 m s(- 1)) and eight grain size classes (range: 10 - 89 mu m). The efficiency of <b>dust</b> deposition <b>catchers</b> diminishes rapidly as the wind speed increases. It also diminishes as the particles caught become coarser. Adding a flow deflector ring to a catcher substantially improves the catcher's efficiency, by up to 100 % in some cases. The addition of glass marbles to a catcher, on the other hand, {{does not seem to}} increase the efficiency, at least not at wind velocities inferior to the deflation threshold. For higher velocities the marbles protect the settled particles from resuspension, keeping them in the catcher. The following five parameters determine the accumulation of aeolian dust in a catcher: the horizontal dust flux, the weight of the particles, atmospheric turbulence, resuspension, and the dust shadow effect created by the catcher. The final accumulation flux depends on the combination of these parameters. The catchers tested in this study belong to the best catchers currently in use in earth science and {{have been the subject of}} various aerodynamic studies to improve their efficiency. Nevertheless the catching efficiency remains low, in the order of 20 - 40 % for wind speeds above 2 in s(- 1). Other catchers suffer from the same low efficiencies. There is, thus, evidence to believe that dust deposition rates published in the aeolian literature and obtained by collecting the sediment in a catcher largely underestimate the true deposition. The errors are considerable, of the order of 100 % and more. A reconsideration of the literature data on aeolian dust deposition measured by catchers is, therefore, required. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

30|$|Overexposure to {{airborne}} {{respirable dust}} can cause disabling, even fatal, respiratory disease in mineworkers. Therefore, exposure to coal dust {{is always an}} important occupational health concern. According to official statistics for Chinese coal mines, over 2.65 million workers were exposed to coal dust, the pneumoconiosis detection rate was 7.2  % and the accumulated number of pneumoconiosis patients was over 57, 000 (Zheng 2011). The occupational health risks mineworkers faced for being exposed to coal dust clouds {{are related to the}} metamorphic degree of the coal, the dust concentration and the cumulative exposure, among other factors (Naidoo et al. 2005; Belle and Phillips 2009; Onder and Yigit 2009; Qin and Liu 2009; Zhang et al. 2013). Statistical data from the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) indicate that, with the increasing intensity of mining operations, the pneumoconiosis detection rate among workers exposed to coal dust in underground coal mines in the USA rose from 4  % in 1999 to 9  % in 2007 (Hall 2008). To reduce the pneumoconiosis detection rate among coal workers, or at least prevent it from increasing, the isolation and removal of dust at working/heading faces is the key measure, because the working face usually has the highest concentration of coal dust in a mine. Currently, the most effective method appears to be the isolation and removal of dust by ventilation or by collection with a <b>dust</b> <b>catcher</b> (Reed et al. 2004; Guo 2007; Li et al. 2007, 2012; Wei 2008; Liu et al. 2009, 2012; Liu 2011; Kuznetsov et al. 2012).|$|E
3000|$|It {{was known}} that {{overexposure}} to airborne respirable dust will cause disabling or fatal respiratory disease, and health problems of coal dust {{have been an}} ongoing occupational health concern. As far as Chinese coal mines, {{it was reported that}} there was over 2.65 million workers exposure to dust and the pneumoconiosis detection percentage was up to 7.2  %, and the number of accumulated pneumoconiosis patients had been over 57, 000 (Zheng 2011). The risks of occupational health of workers, who exposure to coal dust cloud, are directly related to coal metamorphic degree, coal dust concentration, cumulatively exposure time et al. (Naidoo et al. 2005; Belle and Phillips 2009; Onder and Yigit 2009; Qin and Liu 2009; Zhang et al. 2013). For examples, the statistical data from NIOSH (The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) indicated that: for USA underground coal mines, the pneumoconiosis detection percentage of workers exposure to coal dust had arisen from 4  % to 9  %, from 1999 to 2007, as the mining intensity increased (Hall 2008). If the pneumoconiosis detection percentage of coal workers can be kept or decreased, the key may be dust isolated and removal in working/heading face, where there usually is the highest concentration of coal dust. In terms of the problem of coal dust pollutant in two faces, the most effective method of pollutant removal may be the dust isolated (or removal) by ventilation and collection by dust catchers (Reed et al. 2004; Guo 2007; Li et al. 2007; Wei 2008; Liu et al. 2009; Liu 2011; Kuznetsov et al. 2012; Li et al. 2012; [...] Liu et al. 2012). The dust catchers employed in underground coal mines, can be classified as filtering, centrifugal separation and comprehensive system (Colinet et al. 2005; Black et al. 2007; Shorokhov et al. 2009; Koo et al., 2010; Faschingleitner and Hoflinger 2011; Torano et al. 2011; Konorev and Nesterenko 2012; Li et al. 2013). For examples, the <b>dust</b> <b>catcher</b> usually applied in German underground coal mines, is usually a fiber bag precipitator, its dust collection efficiency is high and the bulk is also large. In Poland, the main <b>dust</b> <b>catcher</b> is a cyclone dust collector, and its collection efficiency is up to 99.3  %, and the dewatering efficiency is also up to 98  %, but the operating resistance is over 2, 300 Pa. The collection efficiencies of the above two dust precipitators are usually higher than 95  %, but they may be not suitable for application in Chinese underground mines. Why is so? In the view of economy to technique ratio and engineering geology, the cross sectional area of heading/mining faces is usually not larger than 15  m 2, and the most part is lower than 10  m 2, especially underground coal mines in central southern and southwestern China such as Hunan, Guizhou, Yunan, etc. Therefore, the advanced dust precipitators, which are employed in Germany, Poland et al., are in too large bulk or too high operating resistance for the majority of Chinese underground coal mines. Comprehensively analyzing research progress at home and abroad, as far as Chinese underground coal mines, the shortcoming of the existing dust collector is that: (1) the efficiency of dust removal is low (about 80  %), or (2) the dewatering rate is low (lower than 85  %), or (3) the operating resistance is high (more than 2, 200  Pa), or (4) the length/width is long/wide (more than 10  m/ 2.5  m), or (5) the bulks are large.|$|E
