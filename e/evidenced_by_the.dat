5|$|Before {{the age of}} the bucentaurs, it is {{probable}} that for ceremonies in the Venetian Lagoon the doge was simply assigned a small galley from the Venetian fleet. As Venice's wealth increased due to its naval power, plans were made for a special ship to be built. This is <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> promissioni – sacramental pledges spoken by the doges when they were sworn into office – of Reniero Zeno of 1252, Lorenzo Tiepolo of 1268 and Giovanni Soranzo of 1312 which mention the construction of a bucentaur in the Arsenale shipyard and naval depot.|$|E

5|$|Collectors {{tend to use}} the {{catalogues}} {{produced in}} their own region and language, so in the United States, Scott is used most often as <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> use of Scott numbers in American stamp auction catalogues. In contrast, SG numbers are used in England and Ireland because Stanley Gibbons (a British publisher) produces the catalogue of choice in those countries. Advanced and more specialist collectors have used the David Feldman, later called MacDonnell/Feldman, and later again called MacDonnellWhyte, catalogues between 1978 and 1991, and Hibernian catalogues (1972, 1976, 1980, 1983, 1985, 1986, 2002 and 2009 editions).|$|E
5|$|During {{the siege}} of Echinus by Philip V of Macedon in 211BC, the besiegers built {{underground}} tunnels to protect the soldiers and sappers as they {{went back and forth}} from the camp to the siege works. These included two siege towers connected by a makeshift wickerwork curtain wall mounted with stone-shooting ballistae, and sheds to protect the approach of the battering ram. Despite the early reputation of Macedon as a leader in siege technology, Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt became the center for technological improvements to the catapult by the 3rdcenturyBC, as <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> writings of Philo of Alexandria.|$|E

Mothers, known as ‘queens’, then look after their kits for their first six months of life. Kits are expected to stay in camp at all times, and sleep in a designated and comfortable area known as the ‘nursery’.|$|E
