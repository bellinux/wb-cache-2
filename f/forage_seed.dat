50|$|Although {{the primary}} use of Thinopyrum intermedium is as a <b>forage,</b> <b>seed</b> {{production}} is essential because {{farmers and ranchers}} continue to establish new stands by planting seed. In 1988 over 500 metric tons of seed were harvested in Saskatchewan alone, although more recently the harvest has fallen to less than 225 metric tons in that Canadian province. Average seed yields are about 330 pounds per acre, but on-farm yields of up to 880 pounds per acre have been achieved. Seed is generally produced in rows spaced 30 to 36 inches apart. The wide row spacing (relative to grain crops like wheat) allows for sustained seed yields for five to ten years. Without spacing and occasional tillage between the rows, yields decline rapidly as the plant population becomes increasingly dense through rhizome spread. Despite this, Thinopyrum intermedium is still considered lesser than Wheat by some, as its seeds are comparatively very small.|$|E

5000|$|Saskatchewan {{agricultural}} land comprises 44% {{of the total}} Canadian farmland. Excluding a semi-arid area of the southwest used for grazing the parkland and mixed prairie areas of the province are used for crop production, mixed farming and dairying.

50|$|Agriculture and its related {{businesses}} {{continue to}} be the major economic activity in the Western Interlake. The relatively low land prices, the ability of this land to produce high quality forage crops, the abundance of clean water, and the stable cattle prices have combined to make this area one of the best beef producing areas in the country. The major products produced in this region are agricultural products, specifically grain, hay, <b>forage</b> <b>seed,</b> livestock and PMU (Pregnant Mares Urine). The production of cattle is perhaps the most important agricultural sector in the Western Interlake. Cattle farmers in the R. M. of Eriksdale Agriculture District (the Agriculture District includes Eriksdale, Coldwell and St. Laurent) area managing approximately 44,917 cattle in 2001 of which 15,781 were beef and dairy cows.

5000|$|The {{claims of}} {{inefficiency}} have, however, {{been criticized by}} Economist Joseph E. Medley of the University of Southern Maine, US. [...] Statistics based on value rather than volume of production may give one view of reality, as public-sector food was heavily subsidized and sold at much lower prices than private-sector produce. In addition, the 2 - 3% of arable land allotted as private plots {{does not include the}} large area allocated to the peasants as pasturage for their private livestock; combined with land used to produce grain for fodder, the pasturage and the private plots total almost 20% of all Soviet farmland. Private farming may also be relatively inefficient, taking roughly 40% of all agricultural labor to produce only 26% of all output by value. Another problem is these criticisms tend to discuss {{only a small number of}} consumer products and do not take into account the fact that the kolkhozy and sovkhozy produced mainly grain, cotton, flax, <b>forage,</b> <b>seed,</b> and other non-consumer goods with a relatively low value per unit area. This economist admits to some inefficiency in Soviet agriculture, but claims that the failure reported by most Western experts was a myth. He believes the above criticisms to be ideological in nature and emphasizes [...] "the possibility that socialized agriculture may be able to make valuable contributions to improving human welfare".|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the thermodynamic properties of the process of water sorption in <b>forage</b> turnip <b>seeds.</b> The equilibrium moisture content of <b>forage</b> turnip <b>seeds</b> was determined by the gravimetric-dynamic method for different values of temperature and water activity. According to the results, increasing the moisture content increases the energy required for the evaporation of water in <b>forage</b> turnip <b>seeds,</b> and the values of integral isosteric heat of desorption, within the moisture content range of 3. 33 to 11. 30 (% d. b.), varies from 4, 222. 70 to 2, 870. 34 kJ kg- 1. With the elevation in the equilibrium moisture content, there is an increase in differential entropy and Gibbs free energy, which has positive values, demonstrating non-spontaneity in the process of desorption in the seeds. The theory of enthalpy-entropy compensation can be satisfactorily applied to the sorption phenomenon, and the process of water desorption of <b>forage</b> turnip <b>seeds</b> is controlled by enthalpy...|$|R

40|$|Well-tested {{computer}} simulation {{models of the}} growth, development, and yield of annual crops are being used {{for a wide range}} of purposes, including the prediction of impacts of different management practices and land use systems on food production, farmers' profitability, and the environment. Presentation and interpretation of simulation results can be significantly enhanced through the linking of models with software that allows spatial visualization. Many users of crop simulation models, however, are located in institutions in developing countries where resources are particularly limited. Computer software to perform a variety of spatial analyses was written, which can be run on modest hardware without the need for costly third-party software. The software is an integral part of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), a comprehensive crop simulation model and data system, but can also be run in a stand-alone mode. Users can run spatial simulation experiments and then analyze the results using (i) a geostatistical module to interpolate maps and produce probability surfaces from a network of data points and (ii) a utility that calculates agronomic and economic output statistics from model simulations and maps the results as polygons. The suite of modules, which runs on an IBM-compatible personal computer, interfaces with some widely used third-party GIS software, and the mapping facility enables users to export and import images to a number of common file formats.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate farmers’ WTP for improved forage seeds and to identify the determinants of farmers’ WTP for improved forage seeds in eastern zone of Tigray, Ethiopia. The data were collected from Atsbi-Womberta and Kilte-Awlaelo districts in “December 2014 ” from 120 sample household heads for each forage type for the time period January to December 2014. Bivariate Probit model was used, and come up with 64. 17 %, 55. 83 % and 65 % willing respondents to pay for the improved forages seeds of alfalfa, elephant grass and vetch respectively. The bivariate probit econometric model results of determinants revealed education level, livestock holding, access to credit, initial bid and follow up bids as the significate determining factors of the WTP for improved <b>forage</b> <b>seed.</b> The model have also predicted the mean willingness to pay for each <b>forage</b> <b>seed</b> types, and it is estimated to be 334. 53 ETB/kg, 0. 30 ETB/ 30 cm and 38. 20 ETB/kg for the improved forage seeds of alfalfa, elephant grass cutting and vetch respectively. Based on the model result for better establishment of the seed business, better financial credit access is recommended to make households capable of using improved forages and to produce market based improved forage seeds. Besides it would be easy for farmers to inter into the <b>forage</b> <b>seed</b> business if improved species of livestock are introduced to the study area that could be complementary with the need to increase livestock holding through creating better credit services for groups or individuals who would like to join the livestock business. While introducing these practices, formal and informal learning strategies such as trainings and experiences need to be included as package of modern livestock husbandry, so that the demand will be created and farmers will be more likely willing to pay for the improved forage seeds. In addition, for entrepreneurs who would like to invest on the improved <b>forage</b> <b>seed</b> production it is recommended to start supply the seeds with equivalent to the mean WTP premium prices elicited on this study for each <b>forage</b> <b>seed</b> types with the consideration of market inflation on the time of production season of the area, so that every household farmer would be indifferent between buying the seeds to support their livestock production and producing it.
