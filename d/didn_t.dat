One of the most important aspects in teaching children to foreign language is motivation, because they don t know what it is, what it is for, why learn it, so the teacher must find the ways how to teach them. Everybody has the wrong idea that the new teachers must teach the lower grades because they aren t difficult to teach, but if we analyze it we can conclude that if the best teachers or the most experts taught kinder or garden students, they wouldn t hate to learn English like nowadays happens...|$|E
40|$|This paper reports {{recent events}} in Iceland where the {{political}} agents of oligarchs <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> {{even bother to}} try to influence, let alone contest, a national referendum on a new constitution because, if they <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> like the result, they would simply find ways to nullify the outcome ex post.

It needs to be emphasized that these criticisms, whether well founded or not (and they are not), are irrelevant because Parliament held a national referendum on 20 October 2012 in which the bill and its key individual provisions were accepted by an overwhelming majority of the voters. A democratic nation cannot under any circumstances permit the outcome of national elections, let alone a constitutional referendum, to be fixed ex post, but this is what the Icelandic Parliament is at present trying to do, flirting with a farewell to democracy...|$|E
40|$|In the USA, {{previous}} to {{the implementation}} of the Affordable Care Act, about 50 million people under 65 years <b>didn</b> 4 <b>t</b> have any (private or public) health insurance. A lot of them have been temporally insured via an employer sponsored group insurance. Because of the linkage to the job, group insurance does only provide an incomplete protection against long term health costs. Alternatively, an individual guaranteed renewable contract allows for long term protection. This paper considers the possible options of a young, still good risk person. A person who is a high risk today could have been a healthy and low-risk person in the past. This article analyses essential factors explaining the attractiveness of group insurance compared to an individual long term contract. If the group insurance goes along with the abandonment of long term contracts, it can contribute to a high level of temporarily non-insured persons. As the price gap between employer-sponsored group insurance and individual guaranteed renewable contracts is partly state-induced, non-insurance can also be the result of a state-induced crowding-out of long term protection...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impacts of}} piped water on water quality, sanitation, hygiene and health outcomes in marginalized rural households of north-western Bangladesh using a quasi-experimental analysis. A government organization - the Barindra Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA) - established a piped water network to provide these rural households with improved water as they have poor access to potable water. Using propensity score matching, the study compares a treatment and a control group of households to identify gains in water-sanitation, hygiene and health outcomes. We found that the BMDA piped water infrastructure had {{a positive impact on}} access to improved water and significantly reduced the distance traveled for and time spent on collecting drinking water. However, we found no improvement in the drinking water quality, which was measured by the extent of fecal contamination (E. coli count per 100 ml of water) at the point of use. The hygiene status of food utensils also did not show any improvement; food utensils were tested positive for E. coli in both the control and treatment group. Although access to BMDA piped water in the premises involves cost, it <b>didn</b> 4 <b>t</b> improve hygiene behavior: handwashing with soap after defecation and before feeding children. The treated households own larger water containers which implies that the intervention has had a clear impact on the quantity of water used for household purposes.

The research was done inside on a glass green house at the UNESP - College of Agronomical Science, Rural Engineering Department (Botucatu - SP - Brazil). Two trials were done to evaluate biomass, seedling height and diameter development. The first trial, using underground water on 17 cm, 31 cm and 45 cm depth, with or without coverage fertilization with N-P-K. The second trial was done with 28 flowerpots (12 liters each) and 3 seedlings per unit. The experimental design, {{used to evaluate the}} height and diameter growth and hydric potential and relative plant water content, was: 1 - without water deficit and without coverage fertilization; 2 - with water deficit and without coverage fertilization; 3 - without water deficit and with coverage fertilization; 4 - with water deficit and coverage fertilization. The underground water result showed that 31 cm and fertilization was better for seedling growing rather that 17 cm and without fertilization. The fertilized treatments showed higher plant high and diameter comparing to non fertilized samples, using Tukey test at 5 %. For dry plant matter, the best results were obtained with 31 and 45 cm underground water level. The seedling root system dry mass was decrement along the soil profile.

40|$|Objective: Multidisciplinary {{prenatal}} diagnosis centers {{were created in}} France in 1998 and offer an opportunity of training to ultrasonographers. We aimed to measure {{the impact of their}} creation on the prenatal detection rates of congenital heart diseases (CHD). Methods: We analyzed the sensitivity of the screening performed by first level ultrasonographers (FLU) between 1994 and 2006 by comparing CHD prenatal diagnoses and CHD observed after birth in Angers universitary hospital. Two groups of FLU were compared (those attending the training and a control group of those who <b>didn</b> <b>t).</b> The evolution of these 2 groups detection rates was analyzed on two periods of 6 years (1994 - 1999 & 2000 - 2006) for significant CHD. Results: Of 947 CHD, 438 (46 %) were detected prenatally. The control group sensitivity was 16 % versus 37 % for the FLU attending the training course. Concerning significant CHD, the control group <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> improve its sensitivity between the two periods whereas the other did (54 % vs 75 %, p< 0. 05).

The extant law texts from the four Norwegian law things are used as my primary sources in comparison with the regulations accorning to canon law.

This thesis follows the rites of spiritual and material preparations which often began with the onset of physical illness or even the occassional fortuitous visionary premonition warned of death s proximity. The first of such preparations was baptism. To die well was to die prepared. When death struck, the funerary rite proper began and continued until the body was incorporated into consecrated space.

Patients and methods: prospective observational study of probable and confirmed cases of influenza A (H 1 N 1) / 2009 infection concerning hospitalized patients in a polyvalent intensive care unit (ICU). Results: Thirteen patients have been included between August and September 2009. Three (23 %) <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> have any medical history. The median age was 42 [22 - 69]. Eleven have required pulmonary ventilation for 10. 3 days (+/- 8). Three (23 %) have developed an ARDS. Three patients (23 %) died. To cope with the influx of cases and considering our situation of geographic isolation, it has been needed to totally rework the organization of care: set-up of a specific welcoming channel, division into sectors of the department, opening of additional beds, new on-duty assignment, inter and intra hospital cooperation.

To realize this work, the area has been divided in 18 primaries unities with 30 ha each one and from the selected ones, three unities at which has been allocated ten secondary unities (plot) of 100 x 100 m (one hectare), in a total of 30 ha. Each plot has been subdivided in sub plots of 10 x 10 m (100 m 2), totalizing 100 subplotsin each secondary unity. In 20 from these unities, all the individuals with DBH (Diameter at breast height) 3 cm were measured,while in the 80 lefts, all the individuals ones with DBH 6 cm have been measured. The results showed a total of 16. 487 individualsinventoried before the exploitation and a total of 15. 328 individuals after the exploitation. The 10 families that occur more frequentlyrepresent 53 % of the sampled trees. The diametric distribution <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> present significant variation among the events.

40|$|The Late Quaternary and Holocene glacial {{history of}} Hornstrandir, NW Iceland, have been investigated. The area is of special {{interest}} because it s almost unstudied. Several researchers have proposed that ice free plateaux and nunataks existed in Iceland during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Hornstrandir has been considered a likely candidate for such conditions. Methods such as geomorphological mapping, sediment descriptions of coastal sections and sampling of material for radiocarbon dating, tephra and cosmogenic exposure dating have been applied. Detailed geomorphological maps of the area are also presented. Landforms such as terminal and lateral moraines, hummocky moraines, flutes, rock glaciers, rivers and lakes have been mapped by detailed field investigations and by visual interpretation of orthorectified aerial photographs. Cosmogenic exposure dating has demonstrated that the entire Hornstrandir was covered by ice during the LGM. Cold based ice that preserved the periglacial surface beneath, was situated on the upland plateaux. Coastal sections have shown that cirque glaciers in Hornstrandir coalesced to form valley glaciers that flowed northwards towards the shelf break. The plateaux <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> deglaciate until 18 14 kyr BP. During the Bølling Interstadial, sea level stood at least 5 9 m above the present. By Younger Dryas time, cirque glaciers in Hornstrandir once again formed glaciers that at least {{reached out to the}} present coast. Terminal moraines have been used to estimate that the total glaciated area at some point during deglaciation was 44 km 2. The Saksunarvatn tephra (erupted 10180 ± 60 cal. yr BP) has been sampled at two locations, indicating that most of Hornstrandir was ice-free at Preboreal time. Neoglaciation on Hornstrandir is reflected in raised beaches yielding ages between ~ 2100 1300 cal. yr BP. During the Little Ice Age (LIA) cirque glaciers reached their Holocene maximum. The total glaciated area during the LIA has been estimated to 8. 2 km 2...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a qualitative study into the experience of an economic intervention for landmine victims with chronic pain syndrome in rural Cambodia. The study aims to find changes in chronic pain after an economical intervention {{in the form of a}} loan to the victims, e. g. a cow or a pig or a certain amount of money. This research is following another research in year 2000 by TMC (Tromsø Mineskadesenter) for evaluation of chronic pain in landmine victims on Battambang 1. That study indicated that chronic pain syndrome is a major medical problem in severely injured landmine accident survivors, whether those survivors are amputees or not. The authors found that the quality of primary trauma care did not reduce post-injury pain, and that one of the most important factors associated with post-injury pain was the economic impact of the injury. Data collection took place through fieldwork in Battambang province during October and November 2002. Questionnaire, focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews with landmine victims create the basis of the findings. Visual analog scale for self-evaluating of pain was used as indicator for severity of chronic pain in questionnaires. In depth interview and focus group discussion were used as triangulation of data for chronic pain evaluation. Two major groups of victims were evaluated; first victims who got loan two years ago and second victims who <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> get loan. Results show significant reduction in pain and increasing life quality in victims who got the loan and started a business. Lack of job as a main reason poverty leads to increased risk taking. Economic impact of intervention to improve quality of life seems the major factor to reduce chronic pain and enhance psycho-social rehabilitation. The results of the present study may be of help to policy makers in aiding landmine victims to have income-generating activity in the future...|$|E

The COD of the one leached was in a range from 7. 650 to 28. 250 mg/L. The treatment tried systems were: an UASB type anaerobic reactor, and one Rotating Biological Contactor system. The Rotating Biological contactor was built of a stage with a volume of 60 L and 48 disks. The biggest load adsorbed by Rotating Biological contactor system was 31 g COD/m 2 *d, with an average of removal efficiency about COD of 70 %; and greatest removal efficiency over 90 % for a very best load in one rank from 15 to 20 g COD/m 2 *d, moreover this system presented great stability in front of important variations on leached characteristics and absence of disagreeable faint odors. The UASB reactor of 39, 1 L of volume was operated with a time of hydraulic retention of 36 hours.

The aim of the competitions {{is to build a}} vehicle that achieves the highest possible energy efficiency. DNV GL Fuel Fighter is NTNU s contribution to SEM 2015. This year team consist of 25 student from different studies, where everyone has their area of expertise in the project. The team decided to develop a new Urban Concept vehicle that has a totally different design compared to previous NTNU Urban Concepts. This text is going to be focusing on the aerodynamic aspect of developing the new Urban Concept. The team used the production development methodology from the department of Design Engineering and Materials (IPM) from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The IPM methodology has four different phases, where the aerodynamic aspect was in all phases. There were two design concepts that were of interest, and which got further aerodynamic analysis by intuition, CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and wind tunnel testing in order t o minimize the drag coefficient. Aerodynamics of vehicles are more than just minimizing the drag coefficient, but it was only time to go through that aerodynamic aspect of developing a vehicle. Concept 1 had a drag coefficient of 0. 32 and Concept 2 had a drag coefficient of 0. 27, which were good compared to a normal passenger vehicle that has a drag coefficient between 0. 30 - 0. 45. The chosen concept was Concept 2, not only because it has lower drag coefficient, but also producing Concept 2 was much easier than Concept 1. During SEM the Urban Concept <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> get any approved attempts, because of some problems with the hydrogen leakage from the fuel cells.

Que pode ser evitado com a aplicação de reguladores de crescimento. Nesse sentido, realizou-se um experimento de campo, no município de Castro, PR, visando avaliar os efeitos de doses de nitrogênio nas cultivares de trigo AVANTE e BRS 177. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi blocos ao acaso em esquema fatorial 4 X 4, com quatro repetições para cada cultivar. Os tratamentos constaram da combinação de 100 g i. a ha- 1 de trinexapac-ethyl aplicado entre o 1 e o 2 nó visível e metade entre o 2 e o 3 nó visível, além da testemunha sem aplicação. As doses de nitrogênio em cobertura foram de 90, 135, 180 e 225 kg. ha- 1 para a cultivar AVANTE e 60, 90, 120 e 150 kg. ha- 1 para a cultivar BRS 177. Foram avaliados o stand, números de perfilhos por planta, estatura de plantas, diâmetro de colmo, comprimento dos entre-nós, comprimento do caule do último nó e a inserção da espiga, acamamento no florescimento e na pré-colheita, teor de nitrogênio nas folhas, componentes da produção, produtividade e qualidade industrial do trigo. O Trinexapac-ethyl foi eficiente em reduzir o comprimento dos entre-nós, diminuindo a estatura das plantas e a porcentagem de acamamento, sendo o momento da aplicação do trinexapac-ethyl que promove maiores efeitos na estatura de plantas é entre o 2 e 3 nó visível. A aplicação do trinexapac-ethyl principalmente na fase de 1 e 2 nó visível ou 2 e 3 nó visível promoveu aumento significativo do número de espiguetas e na produtividade de grãos quando comparado ao tratamento sem aplicação do regulador de crescimento na cultivar AVANTE, o que não ocorreu para a cultivar BRS 177. O aumento da dose de nitrogênio aumenta o teor do elemento da planta e promove maior acamamento, fator que pode ser minimizado pela aplicação do redutor de crescimento. Não ocorreu ganho sobre os componentes de produção e produtividade pelo aumento das doses de nitrogênio, mostrando que as doses recomendadas atendem as exigências das cultivares. A qualidade industrial do trigo não foi influenciada pela aplicação de trinexapac-ethyl, com exceção da cultivar BRS 177 que apresentou aumento do peso hectolitrico nos tratamentos com trinexapac-ethyl. O aumento da dose de nitrogênio aumentou a quantidade de glúten úmido, seco e da Força de Glúten (W) e diminuiu o peso hectolitrico (PH) e Falling Number (FN) para cultivar BRS 117, na cultivar AVANTE as doses de N não influenciaram os parâmetros referentes à qualidade industrial. The use {{of nitrogen}} {{in the culture}} of the wheat seeks the increase of the productivity. However, it also increases the probability of occurrence of the lodgnign. That can be avoided with the application of growth regulators. In that sense, he took place a field experiment, in the city of Castro, PR, seeking to evaluate the effects of the application of the trinexapac-ethyil in different times and of doses of nitrogen on wheat, cultivars (VANTE and BRS 77). The experimental field was blocks at random in factorial outline 4 x 4 with four repetitions. The treatments consisted of the combination of 100 g i. a ha - 1 of applied trinexapac-ethyl among the 1 and 2 visible knot of the wheat, 2 and 3 visible knot, sequential application on half of the dose between the 1 and the 2 visible knot and half between the 2 and 3 visibleknot, besides the witness without trinexapac-ethyl apllication. The doses of nitrogen were of 90, 135, 180 and 225 kg. ha - 1 fot to AVANTE and 60, 90, 120 and 150 kg. ha - 1 for to BRS 177. They were certain the stand, tillers numbers for plant, height of plants, diameter of the stem, lengthof the stem, length of thes stem among the leaf flag unitl the insert of the erar, lodging in the antesis and in the pre-cropo haverst, tenor of nitrogen in the leaves, yield and yield componentes and industrial quality of thewheat. The trinexapac-ethyl was efficient in reducing the length of the he/she enters us, reducidng the height of the plants and lodging percentage, being the moment of application of hte trinexapac-ethyl that promotes larger effects in the height of plants in between the 2 and 3 visible knot. The application of hte trinexapac - ethyl mainly in the phase of 1 and 2 visivle knot or 2 and 3 visible knot promoted significant increase of the ears number and in the productivity of grains when compared to the treatment without application of the growth regulator in cultivar AVANTE, what <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> happen for to cultivar BRS 177. The increase of the dose of nitrogen increases the tenor of the element in the plant and it promotes larger lodging factor that can be mininmized by the application of the growth reducer.

40|$|Two small plot {{efficacy}} {{trials were}} conducted evaluating different insecticide rotation regimes using commercially available insecticides {{and the effectiveness}} of new insecticide chemistries to control citrus thrips. Under the consistently cool conditions experienced during the first four weeks of the trial, Dimethoate, Success, Baythroid, Agri-Mek, Vydate and Carzol all of the offered adequate control and would fit well in the petal fall window. This is in contrast with previous years experiences when high temperatures within a week of petal fall would result in all treatments except Carzol requiring a re-treatment within ten days. All of the rotation schemes evaluated required three insecticide applications to get through the season, and {{did not appear to be}} greatly different in controlling thrips and producing high quality fruit under the environmental conditions experienced. However, the Dimethoate - Success - Baythroid rotation scheme was most cost effective. When temperatures were in the 70 's to low 80 's, Dimethoate and Vydate offered about three weeks control, Success, Carzol, Baythroid and Agri-Mek all offered about four weeks control. When temperatures were in the mid to upper 80 's and low to mid 90 's, Success provided about three weeks control while Carzol <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> require re-treatment for 4 weeks.

In the experimentals test, AZEXP 1 appeared to offer knockdown activity at temperatures less than 90 F, and only suppression at higher temperatures. AZEXP 2, appeared to be a viable citrus thrips material, with activity similar to Success and Carzol.

40|$|When the European Union {{decided in}} 2000 to allow {{chocolate}} to contain up to 5 % vegetal fats other than cocoa butter, shea butter was proclaimed as a promising substitute. Two years later, {{this has not}} happened. Palm oil, though of lesser quality, is taking over shea s promised place as a cocoa butter equivalent (CBE). What went wrong with shea rightly called women s white gold ? Shea butter is extracted from {{the fruits of the}} shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa, also known as Butryospermum paradoxum) which grows in the southern Sahelian zone, from Senegal in the west to Uganda and Sudan in eastern Africa. On average, one tree produces 15 to 20 kg of fruits, yielding 1. 5 kg of butter. Processed nuts fetch in general one and a half times more 200 /t) than the raw ones. Harvesting from the wild and processing the butter is done mainly by women. The butter is processed into cooking oil and consumed locally or exported as the basis for cosmetics or fat in foodstuffs. The downside is that the shea tree is hard to domesticate, starts bearing fruit only after 15 to 20 years and has a fluctuating yield. The combination of unreliable and small supply with low purchasing prices on intermediate trade markets has meant that shea has not become a strong CBE. Of the estimated total production of 1. 7 million t, only 65, 000 t is exported as a CBE and 3, 000 t for cosmetics. There is room for improvement if producers can organise themselves to guarantee a stable supply and establish direct links with such markets as the cocoa and cosmetics industries. In Burkina Faso, the UN fund for women (UNIFEM) has mediated a deal between producers and L Occitane, a French firm, which now buys directly from the Union des Groupements Kiswendsida (UGK). In 2001, L Occitane bought 60 t of butter directly from UGK, an umbrella organisation for 100 shea-producing women s groups.

40|$|Necessity {{breathes}} {{life into}} art. As a listener I don't want art that's nice, clean {{and a perfect}} match for somebody's sofa. I don't want generalities. I don't want archetypes. Any sophisticated smart talked surface is wasted, if beneath there's not a raw core of necessity, dripping of the artists pains and angers, and glowing of her intense will to act. In this essay I want to {{shed some light on}} the effect of necessity in storytelling. Theoretically I could have done this by analysing oral contemporary stories (and oral stories are always contemporary). But being a cultural historian, I regard the past as a useful thinking tool: In the present we tactfully conceal our selves and our fellow human beings under a smooth collective surface. In the past the scientist should feel free to shamelessly aim for the individual, as close as the sources permits. Tactfulness is out of place, as he who has left traces in writing, must have done so for them to be followed. I have been following the traces left by Marie de France in her 12 th century trouvère tale Lanval, by Jean d´Arras in Mélusine, written in Poitou, 1393, and by Jón Guðmundsson in his tales Ljúflingskonan and Selameyjan from 17 th century Iceland. Lanval, Ljúflingskonan and Selameyjan are included in Norwegian translations, for the very first time. The mention stories all include the same storyline, indicating that the storytellers based their tales on already existing art. This way of working is much more common in storytelling than in other art forms. I m examining this phenomenon, not by searching for common features; the common features are visible already, they are of no interest. What s of interest is the individual and contextual, and the necessities that brought the story to life. Sad enough, the reaction I got when I presented these very interesting perspectives for an essay to certain persons, was "What about the folk?" What about them?! I was actually tempted just to scream "Grow up, idiots!". But I <b>didn</b> <b>t.</b> In stead I included an extra bonus section featuring the necessities of the individuals who made "the folk" into a household tale, namely the brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm.
