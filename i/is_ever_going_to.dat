She also praised the performances of the cast, by deeming their acting [...] "remarkable". [...] "That is really what it's all about. We have to cherish the time that we have here, and love the people who surround and support us, even if they make us crazy, because things happen. Brain surgery, Alzheimer's and weddings.

[...] Bloody Disgusting gave it a 3.5/5 score, saying that [...] "Bustillo and Maury have made the best TCM film in quite some while.
