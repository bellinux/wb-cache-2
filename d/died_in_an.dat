5|$|Exton {{submitted}} {{his report}} to Madeleine's Fund in November 2008, but the fund told Exton {{that the report}} and its e-fits had to remain confidential. The relationship between {{the company and the}} fund had soured, in part because of a dispute over fees, and in part because the report was critical of the McCanns and their friends; it suggested that Madeleine may have <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> accident after leaving the apartment herself through its unlocked patio doors. The fund passed the e-fits to the police—the Polícia Judiciária and Leicestershire police had them by October 2009, and Scotland Yard received them when they became involved in August 2011—but did not otherwise release them. Kate McCann did not include them with the other images of suspects in her book, Madeleine (2011), although she suggested that both the Tanner and Smith sightings were crucial.|$|E
