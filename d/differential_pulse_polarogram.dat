40|$|The {{center of}} gravity method (COG) was applied (for the first time) in voltammetry (polarography) {{as a tool for}} very precise {{determination}} of peak potentials, and signal shifts. Basically, the adjustment of the method consists of finding the optimal fraction of the peak that contains information about peak position, either of original signal or of its 1 st or 2 nd derivatives, along with optimal selection of parameters for Savitzky-Golay smoothing of original curves and elimination of baseline influence. The principle of the method and its validation were demonstrated and checked on simulated <b>differential</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>polarograms</b> (DPP) representing a series of curves for the determination of stability constants of labile metal complexes (DeFord-Hume method). It was shown that COG outperforms the classical “one-point” method (OPM) in precision and accuracy, providing excellent results even if a very large step potential (e. g. 10  mV) was used. The problems of reduced accuracy and precision in case of curved (non-ideal) baseline and asymmetric peaks were successfully overcome by applying COG on curves transformed by 1 st and/or 2 nd derivatives. The method was additionally examined in details on a simple experimental dataset of cadmium chloride complexes in 4  mol[*]dm− 3 ionic strength solution and on a more complex dataset of uranyl selenate complexes in 3  mol[*]dm− 3 ionic strength solution. Stability constants obtained by COG agree well with those in the literature with much better precision than the classical one-point method (checked by standard error of the fit) ...|$|R

The pKg {{values of}} each compound {{were determined by}} both an ultraviolet spectroscopic method and a polarographic method. The pKa values calculated by each technique were in good agreement. The reversibilty of each compound 2 ̆ 7 s electrode reaction was assessed from their sampled direct current (DC) polarograms, and {{it was found that}} each reaction was quasireversible in nature. The electrocapillary (EC) curves of 2 MP and 2 MP- 0 indicated that the product of their corresponding electrode reactions (a mercury thiolate salt) was adsorbed at the electrode surface. In cyclic voltammetric (CV) analysis, the oxidation peak current was controlled by diffusion of the mercaptan to the electrode. However, as the concentration was increased, an adsorption controlled oxidation peak was also present in the recorded CV 2 ̆ 7 s. The CV 2 ̆ 7 s displayed the characteristics of weak thiolate adsorption at the electrode surface, and also the film formation was dependent on the time the potential was held positive of the reaction potential. Calibration curves from <b>differential</b> <b>pulse</b> (DP) <b>polarograms</b> and <b>differential</b> <b>pulse</b> cathodic stripping voltammograms (DPCSV) were constructed to find the linear dependence of peak current with concentration.

The peak current due to 2 MP, at concentrations higher than 1 x 10 M, was greater than that due to equimolar concentrations of the other three mercaptans. This seemed to indicate that the 2 MP electrode reaction product was adsorbed in a more compact film at the electrode surface, than the products of the other three mercaptans. The different possible electrode mechanisms and their correlation with their current potential equations were examined. A voltammetric procedure was then developed for the determination of 2 -chloropyridine-N-oxide (2 PC 1 - 0) and the sodium salt of 2 MP- 0 in an industrial process stream...|$|R
