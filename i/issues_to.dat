5|$|A Post Enumeration Survey (PES) {{was carried}} out to find the common <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> be {{considered}} into account for future census enumeration activities. The results of the PES indicated that 92.7 per cent of total Zambian residents were captured in the 2010 census, leaving an under count of 7.3 per cent. The undercount was more in rural areas with an estimated 9.5 per cent {{of the total population}} and 3.8 per cent in the urban areas.|$|E

5|$|During a {{press conference}} on 26 February 2015, Chovanec {{introduced}} five areas that were to be scrutinized {{in connection with the}} Uherský Brod attack: the communication of national police with municipal authorities, possible changes in crisis plans, operational range of tactical teams, and enhanced training of policemen. Chovanec didn't repeat his sentiment regarding the number of gun license holders, and instead specified that one of the <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> be analyzed will be the issuing and revocation of licenses under the existing legislation.|$|E

5|$|Equal {{franchise}} {{was eventually}} won {{with the passing}} of the Representation of the People Act 1928.

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of a 2016 interdepartmental report into the issue of mental health in the justice system, McEntee stated her belief that it is unacceptable to send people with mental health <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> prison, and that {{this is an issue that}} must be tackled by the government.

5|$|Skelton {{was bitter}} about CBS's {{cancellation}} {{for many years}} afterwards. Believing the demographic and salary <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> be irrelevant, he accused CBS of bowing to the anti-establishment, anti-war faction {{at the height of}} the Vietnam War, saying his conservative political and social views caused the network to turn against him. He had invited prominent Republicans, including Vice President Spiro Agnew and Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen, to appear on his program.|$|E

5|$|Although Charles {{had been}} criticised {{severely}} for granting the large ransom payment to the Vikings, {{he had other}} more critical <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> deal with at the same time, including disputes with his brothers, regional revolts and disgruntled nobles, as well as pressure from abroad. Since he would have trouble trusting his own counts to assemble and lead troops to defeat Ragnar's large force militarily, paying them off instead would buy Charles time, and possibly peace from further Viking raids—at least in the near future.|$|E
5|$|Although Dark Horse had {{approved}} 36 issues, {{there was still}} a chance the book could sell poorly and receive an early cancellation. The decision would be made after receiving the final sales number for the third issue, meaning Kindt was only guaranteed six issues. Not wanting to risk the series being cut off {{in the middle of a}} story, he designed the first six <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> stand alone if necessary. Kindt pencilled two endings for the last page of issue six so he would be prepared either way.|$|E
5000|$|Soldier Knives are <b>issued</b> <b>to</b> every recruit or {{member of}} the Swiss Armed Forces and the knives <b>issued</b> <b>to</b> {{officers}} have never differed from those <b>issued</b> <b>to</b> non-commissioned officers or privates.

5|$|Aphilas {{introduced}} {{a number of}} different standards for all three metals, some of which lasted through to the 7th century, while the use of others ended with his reign. His new gold coins (issued in conjunction with the older) of a quarter aureus and eighth aureus were soon abandoned (each are known from only one specimen), and 1/16 aureus coins have been found, though these {{are more likely to be}} deliberate debasements to increase profit (Aksumite gold was generally very pure, however). Aphilas's silver coin, however, issued at half the weight of the former, became the new Aksumite standard for silver up until the end of coinage. The older coin was presumably more valuable than needed, and the new coin remedied the problem. Aphilas's bronze issue, however, was instead doubled to 4.83grams. The coin's rarity may attest to its quick withdrawal from the market, as is assumed with his quarter-aureus. These two issues are the only one of Aphilas's <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> portray him frontally, rather than in profile.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{two state}} {{elections}} were held, in 1941 and 1944. In the 1941 election, {{there was a}} significant decrease in the independent vote, and both the Labor Party and the LCL made gains, with Playford forming the LCL's first majority government. This was in large part due to the LCL's shift to the right on social <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> usurp the independents' appeal. In 1942, compulsory voting (but not enrolment) was introduced, and first took effect at the 1944 election, with an increase in voter turnout from 51% to 89%. Again Playford won with a one-seat LCL majority, hanging on {{with the help of the}} malapportioned electoral system.|$|E
5|$|Implementing the {{provisions}} and mandates of the Nunn-Cohen Act, however, was neither rapid nor smooth. One {{of the first}} <b>issues</b> <b>to</b> surface was appointing an ASD (SO/LIC), whose principal duties included monitorship of special operations activities and low-intensity conflict activities of the Department of Defense. The Congress even {{increased the number of}} assistant secretaries of defense from 11 to 12, but the Department of Defense still did not fill this new billet. In December 1987, the Congress directed Secretary of the Army John O. Marsh to carry out the ASD (SO/LIC) duties until a suitable replacement was approved by the Senate. Not until 18 months after the legislation passed did Ambassador Charles Whitehouse assume the duties of ASD (SO/LIC).|$|E
