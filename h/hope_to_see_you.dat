500|$|We {{have been}} working {{together}} as Destiny's Child since we were 9, and touring together since we were 14. After {{a lot of discussion}} and some deep soul searching, we realized that our current tour has given us the opportunity to leave Destiny's Child on a high note, united in our friendship and filled with an overwhelming gratitude for our music, our fans, and each other. After all these wonderful years working together, we realized that {{now is the time to}} pursue our personal goals and solo efforts in earnest...No matter what happens, we will always love each other as friends and sisters and will always support each other as artists. We want to thank all of our fans for their incredible love and support and <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> all again as we continue fulfilling our destinies. —Destiny's Child, MTV ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{consistent}} {{performances in}} the 2012–13 domestic season, Dhawan was rewarded with a call-up to the Indian Test squad in February 2013 for the four-match series against Australia. He was the third-choice opener in the squad which consisted of Test regulars Virender Sehwag and Murali Vijay. India chose Sehwag and Vijay over Dhawan {{in the first two}} Tests, after which Sehwag was dropped from the squad owing to his poor form. No replacement was named in the squad for Sehwag, which made Dhawan the favorite to take his place in the third Test. Dhawan made his Test debut in the Test at Mohali on 14 March, receiving the cap from Sachin Tendulkar who said to him: [...] "We have known you as a very gutsy player in domestic cricket, now we <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> as a gutsy player in international cricket, so show us some guts." [...] The first day of the match was washed out by rain, and Australia elected to bat first after winning the toss on the second day. Australia were bowled out for 408 {{on the morning of the}} third day. In reply, India opened the innings with Dhawan and Vijay. The duo batted out the rest of the third day taking India to 283 for no loss at stumps on third day, with Dhawan batting on 185 and Vijay batting on 83. In the process, Dhawan scored the fastest century ever on Test debut, off 85 balls, breaking the long-held record of Gundappa Viswanath (137 vs Australia at Kanpur, 1969). Dhawan was dismissed for 187 (174 balls) in the second over of the fourth day, caught by Ed Cowan at silly point off the bowling of Nathan Lyon. He did not bat in India's second innings after suffering a hand injury while fielding during the fourth day. India went on to win the match by 6 wickets, and Dhawan won the man of the match award. He missed the fourth Test at Delhi after being ruled out for six weeks due to a fracture in his left hand.|$|E

If all {{the people}} whom one has met abroad, and who have said, [...] "We hope to meet you often in town," [...] had but made any the {{slightest}} efforts to realize their hopes by sending a simple line of invitation through the penny post, what an enormous dinner acquaintance one would have had!
