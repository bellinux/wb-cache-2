5|$|On 22 November 2012, the Land Transport Authority {{carried out}} a ground {{deployment}} exercise with SMRT to test their <b>incident</b> <b>management</b> plans {{in the event of}} a train service disruption. In total, about 135 personnel including representatives from the Singapore Police Force's Transport Command (TransCom) and SBS Transit participated in the exercise. Train service continued as per normal and commuters were not affected by the exercise. Codenamed 'Exercise Greyhound', the exercise went through the scenario of a broken rail on the East West Line at Buona Vista. SMRT had also activated their Rail <b>Incident</b> <b>Management</b> Plan.|$|E
5|$|By 11 January, the Apache Corporation began {{evacuating}} all non-essential {{personnel from}} oil rigs {{in the path}} of the storm. The Rio Tinto Group shut down iron exports at its Dampier and Cape Lambert ports due to rough seas. Across the Pilbara region, the State Emergency Service advised residents to secure loose objects and ensure their emergency kits were stocked. <b>Incident</b> <b>management</b> teams were also established to help people in the wake of the storm. Additionally, urban search and rescue equipment was set up in Karratha. Horizon Power dispatched additional linemen to the most at-risk areas in Narelle's path to speed up power restoration in the wake of the storm. In Carnarvon, mango producers picked as much of their fruit as possible before the storm arrived to minimise losses.|$|E
5|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, Shell Oil {{evacuated}} about 40{{workers from}} drilling operations. BP and Chevron also evacuated workers from platforms {{in the western}} and central Gulf, though neither predicted substantial effects on production. A few oil refineries on land were closed, such as one operated by Marathon Oil in Texas City, Texas. Governor of Texas Rick Perry issued a disaster declaration for 17Texas counties that were threatened by Tropical Storm Edouard. Perry activated up to 1,200National Guard troops, a 70member rescue team, six helicopters, and an <b>incident</b> <b>management</b> team that brings food and water to affected areas. Under the order, about 200buses became available in San Antonio and Houston to help in evacuations. Dow Chemical shut down their plants in Clear Lake and La Porte. The United States Coast Guard also ceased cargo operations to the Galveston-Houston area by late on August4. Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal declared a statewide emergency. In Cameron Parish, Louisiana the Office of Emergency Preparedness ordered a mandatory evacuation, where Sheriff's deputies also erected roadblocks.|$|E

A set of performance indicators, which assists monitoring in a proper way, is described regarding: the <b>incident</b> response <b>management</b> system; information security culture; number of incidents responded to; average time spent on responding; consequences of incidents; number of incidents of high loss; downtime of SCADA systems; total costs of incident response; and learning. The entire set of proposed indicators is well suited for monitoring the total <b>incident</b> response <b>management</b> of an organisation as it covers all parts of <b>incident</b> response <b>management.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} the debates in the research literature surrounding the provision of critical <b>incident</b> stress <b>management</b> (CISM) and outlines the implications for social work. The literature reviewed suggests that critical incident stress debriefing (CISD) as an intervention needs to be offered {{as part of a}} comprehensive programme of critical <b>incident</b> stress <b>management</b> that is integrated and sensitive to the organizational context. Strengths-based principles need to underpin an integrated critical <b>incident</b> stress <b>management</b> policy that is sensitive to differences in individual responses, organizational contexts and diverse fields of social work practice.

25|$|The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) {{and other}} fire safety experts, {{including}} Roger L. Yow, {{president of the}} Charleston Firefighters Association and a former captain with 25 years of service in the department, {{have been critical of}} {{the manner in which the}} fire was handled. Union officials and other fire safety experts claim the City of Charleston Fire Department did not follow procedures consistent with the National <b>Incident</b> <b>Management</b> System. South Carolina governor Mark Sanford directed all state and local emergency response agencies to adopt the system in 2005. Acting state fire marshal John Reich said the state does not inspect the operating procedures of fire departments, but they assume that departments are following guidelines prescribed in the National <b>Incident</b> <b>Management</b> System. Some fire safety experts have also questioned why so many firefighters were in a burning building with a steel truss roof, which is known to be a serious safety hazard for firefighters. A routine fire preplan of the structure in June 2006 made no mention of its roof construction, and it has been suggested that CFD firefighters did not pull the ceiling to check for extension into the roof structure.|$|E
25|$|Firefighters {{are trained}} to use {{communications}} equipment to receive alarms, give and receive commands, request assistance, and report on conditions. Since firefighters from different agencies routinely provide mutual aid to each other, and routinely operate at incidents where other emergency services are present, {{it is essential to}} have structures in place to establish a unified chain of command, and share information between agencies. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency has established a National <b>Incident</b> <b>Management</b> System. One component of this system is the Incident Command System.|$|E
