50|$|<b>Estradiol</b> <b>benzoate</b> {{was one of}} {{the first}} estrogens to be {{developed}} and marketed. In 1931, Adolf Butenandt found that the benzoic acid ester of estrone had a prolonged duration of action.

40|$|Background: Insecticides are {{chemicals}} {{that are often}} encountered in everyday life. These substances can disrupt the body's endocrine hormonal balance so that it's called Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs). EDC works by disrupting the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis. Thus, it can affect the Leydig cell. Aim: To {{determine the effect of}} exposure of estrogen-containing insecticides to testicular Leydig cell histological appearance. Methods:This was a true experimental study with parallel post-test only control group design. It used Sprague Dawley rat aged 3 days post-natal (n = 25) which were randomly divided into 5 groups (control group (n = 5); 25 mg β <b>estradiol</b> 3 - <b>benzoate</b> (n = 5); burning mosquito repellent (n = 5); 3 ml of liquid mosquito repellent (n = 5); and 4 ml of liquid mosquito repellent (n = 5)). Exposure is given for 28 days. At the age of 100 days, testes were taken and examined their histopathological appearance of Leydig cell malignancies using HE staining. The statistical test used Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney test. Results: In this study, there was {{an increase in the number}} of testicular Leydig cell groups in each treatment group as compared tocontrol group. There was significant difference between control group with 25 mg β estradiol 3 -benzoate (p = 0. 007), burning mosquito repellent (p = 0. 008), and liquid repellent 4 ml (p = 0. 008) treated group. However, there was no significant difference between the treatment groups of 3 ml liquid repellent as compraed to the control group (p = 0. 827). Conclusion: Exposure to insecticides may lead to increase in the number of Leydig cell groups. Keywords: Insecticides, Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals, testicular Leydig cell malignancy...|$|R
40|$|Effects of estrogens on {{cardiovascular}} {{structure in}} uninephrectomized SHRsp rats. BackgroundThe risk {{of cardiovascular disease}} in uremic patients is greater in male than in female patients. Estrogens seem to play a cardioprotective role until menopause. Experimental data {{on the effect of}} estrogens on cardiovascular damage are controversial and potential underlying mechanisms especially in renal failure have not been fully clarified. MethodsThree-month-old female uninephrectomized stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHRsp) rats were sham-operated or ovariectomized. Subsequently, they received either vehicle (sesame oil) or 17 -β- 3 <b>benzoate</b> <b>estradiol</b> (E 2) (25 μg/day) or estriol (E 3) (0. 02 mg/day), respectively. After 3 months the animals were sacrified and the organs were harvested using pressure-controlled perfusion fixation. Stereologic parameters such as capillary length density (LV), mean intercapillary distance (MID), and volume density of the interstitial tissue (Vv) were quantitated. Additionally, expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), flt- 1, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), endothelin A receptor (ETA) receptor, and α estrogen receptor was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Intramyocardial capillaries and the aorta were investigated by morphometric methods. ResultsLV (mm/mm 3) was significantly lower (2421 ± 500) and MID (μm) significantly higher (22. 2 ± 2. 33) in vehicle-treated uninephrectomized/ovariectomized compared to uninephrectomized/sham-ovariectomized controls (LV 3629 ± 960, MID 12. 7 ± 2. 7) as well as estradiol (LV 3340 ± 739, MID 12. 1 ± 4. 96) and estriol (LV 4655 ± 618, MID 14. 2 ± 2. 89) treated uninephrectomized/ovariectomized animals. The volume density of the cardiac interstitium was higher in vehicle-treated uninephrectomized/ovariectomized animals compared to uninephrectomized/sham-ovariectomized, estradiol and estriol treated uninephrectomized/ovariectomized rats. The protein level expression of TGF-β was higher in vehicle treated uninephrectomized/ovariectomized compared to uninephrectomized/sham and all treatment groups. ConclusionIn ovariectomized SHRsp rats with moderate renal failure cardiac lesions were strikingly less after estradiol or estriol treatment.

40|$|In adult rats, only {{females are}} capable of {{generating}} an LH surge in response {{to high levels of}} ovarian steroids. This is because the ability to generate LH surges in adulthood in response to ovarian steroids is suppressed by high levels of testosterone during neonatal life. We have previously shown that galanin gene expression in GnRH neurons is induced by ovarian steroids in association with an LH surge, suggesting that galanin plays a role in the generation of the LH surge. If this is the case, then the induction of galanin gene expression in GnRH neurons in response to ovarian steroids might, like the LH surge itself, be sexually differentiated during the neonatal period. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated gonadal steroid levels in four groups of rat pups {{on the first day of}} life and looked at the ability of ovarian steroids to induce an LH surge and stimulate galanin gene expression in GnRH neurons of adult animals. The four groups consisted of female pups that were injected with either 10 micrograms of testosterone propionate (n = 6; testosterone-treated females) or vehicle (n = 6; control females) and male pups that were either castrated (n = 6; castrated males) or sham-castrated (n = 6; sham-castrated males). All animals were then gonadectomized at 59 or 60 days of age, except for the males that had been castrated neonatally. Seven weeks later, the animals were challenged with <b>estradiol</b> (E 2) <b>benzoate</b> and progesterone (P) in a paradigm that reliably produces an LH surge. (The rats were injected sc with 15 - 30 micrograms of E 2 on day 0 at 1030 h and 5 mg of P on day 2 at 1200 h.) The animals were then killed between 1800 h and 1840 h on day 2 at the time of the expected LH surge, and their brains were processed for double-label in situ hybridization to estimate cellular levels of galanin messenger RNA (mRNA) in GnRH neurons. We reconfirmed the classical observation that the ability to generate an LH surge in response to E 2 /P is suppressed by neonatal exposure to testosterone. Galanin mRNA levels in GnRH neurons showed a similar pattern: after E 2 /P priming, galanin mRNA levels in GnRH neurons were significantly higher in normal females and in males castrated neonatally than in normal males and in females treated with testosterone neonatally. These results demonstrate that the E 2 /P induction of galanin gene expression in GnRH neurons at the time of the LH surge is sexually differentiated during the neonatal period and suggest that the increase in galanin gene expression in GnRH neurons could be one of the mechanisms underlying the sex difference in gonadotropin release seen in rats. ...|$|R
50|$|Estradiol dipropionate (BAN, JAN) (brand names Agofollin, Di-Ovocyclin, Progynon DP, others) is a semisynthetic, steroidal {{estrogen}} that is or {{has been}} marketed in the United States and Europe. It is the 3,17β-dipropanoyl ester of estradiol. Along with <b>estradiol</b> <b>benzoate,</b> estradiol dipropionate {{was one of}} the first estradiol esters to be developed, having been patented in 1937, was assessed in clinical studies by 1939, and has been marketed by Schering as Progynon DP and Ciba Pharmaceutical Products as Di-Ovocylin since at least 1940. Relative to <b>estradiol</b> <b>benzoate,</b> estradiol dipropionate has enhanced and very prolonged effects. Prior to the development and introduction of estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate in the 1950s, estradiol dipropionate and <b>estradiol</b> <b>benzoate</b> were the most widely used estradiol esters.|$|E
50|$|A single {{intramuscular}} injection of 5 mg <b>estradiol</b> <b>benzoate</b> {{has been found}} to result in peak circulating concentrations of 940 pg/mL estradiol and 343 pg/mL estrone, which occurred at about 2 days post-injection (see table). Compared to two other commonly used estradiol esters (which were also assessed in the study), <b>estradiol</b> <b>benzoate</b> had the shortest duration, at approximately 4 to 5 days, whereas estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate were found to last for 7-8 days and 11 days, respectively. This is because <b>estradiol</b> <b>benzoate</b> has a shorter and less bulky fatty acid chain and in relation to this is comparatively less lipophilic. For a given estradiol ester, the shorter or less extensive the fatty acid chain is, the less lipophilic, shorter-lasting, and less uniform/plateau-like the resultant levels of estradiol are as well as the higher the peak/maximal levels are (and hence more spike-like).|$|E
