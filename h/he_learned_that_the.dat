5|$|After the Warrior left, Black Hawk {{decided to}} seek {{refuge in the}} north with the Ojibwes. Only about 50 people, {{including}} Wabokieshiek, agreed to go with him; the others remained, determined to cross the Mississippi and return to Sauk territory. The next morning, on August 2, Black Hawk was heading north when <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> American army had closed in on {{the members of the}} British Band who were trying to cross the Mississippi. He tried to rejoin the main body, but after a skirmish with American troops near present-day Victory, Wisconsin, he gave up the attempt. Sauk chief Weesheet later criticized Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek for abandoning the people during the final battle of the war.|$|E
5|$|In 535, Bessas was {{appointed}} {{as one of}} Belisarius' lieutenants (along with Constantine and Peranius) in the expedition against the Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy. He accompanied Belisarius {{in the early stages}} of the campaign, from the recovery of Sicily to the siege of Naples, and was present at the latter's fall in November 536. From there the Byzantine army advanced on Rome, which it captured without a fight. Belisarius sent Constantine and Bessas to capture various outlying towns, but when <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new Gothic king, Witiges, was marching on Rome, he recalled them. Bessas tarried for a while near the town of Narni, which controlled the direct route from the Gothic capital, Ravenna, over the Apennines to Rome, and there met and defeated the Gothic vanguard in a skirmish.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Allied victory, Truman journeyed to Europe for the Potsdam Conference. He was there when <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Trinity test of the first atomic bomb on July 16 had been successful. He hinted to Joseph Stalin that the U.S. was about to use {{a new kind of}} weapon against the Japanese. Though {{this was the first time}} the Soviets had been officially given {{information}} about the atomic bomb, Stalin was already aware of the bomb project, having learned about it (through espionage) long before Truman did.|$|E

5|$|On October 8, 1972, {{the men of}} Alpha Phi {{voted to}} admit women into their chapter. They alerted National Headquarters, and National Secretary Robert H. Rubin replied telling Alpha Phi not to {{administer}} any degree of ritual until the issue could be discussed in person. When Rubin arrived at Rutgers on November 11, 1972, <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first degree of ritual had been administered, which began formal probationary membership. Alpha Phi's charter was immediately revoked and their chapter was placed on suspension. On November 13, the former Alpha Phi chapter formally reorganized as Mu Upsilon Alpha. On October 7, 2007, Mu Upsilon Alpha became a chapter of Mu Beta Psi.|$|E
5|$|Shulgin began {{studying}} organic chemistry as a Harvard University scholarship {{student at the}} age of 16. In 1943 he dropped out of school to join the U.S. Navy. While serving on USS Pope in the Navy during World War II, Shulgin was given a glass of orange juice by a nurse prior to surgery for a thumb infection. Shulgin drank the juice and, assuming that the powder {{at the bottom of the}} glass was a sedative, fell asleep rapidly. Upon waking <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> powder was undissolved sugar. The experience made him aware of the influence of placebos over the human mind.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{positive}} reception accorded to L'Arianna at its premiere, the duke did not request a second showing, {{as he had}} with L'Orfeo the previous year". The next hint of a performance of L'Arianna is in 1614, when the Medici court in Florence requested {{a copy of the}} score, presumably with the intention of staging it. There is, however, no record of any such performance there. Early in 1620 Striggio asked Monteverdi to send him the music for a projected performance in Mantua as part of the celebration for the Duchess Caterina's birthday. Monteverdi went to the trouble and expense of preparing a new manuscript with revisions; had he had more time, he informed Striggio, he would have revised the work more thoroughly. Hearing nothing further from the Mantuan court, Monteverdi wrote to Striggio on 18 April 1620, offering to help with the staging. A month or so later, however, <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> duchess's celebrations had been scaled back, and that there had been no performance of L'Arianna.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1925, Waugh's outlook briefly improved, with the {{prospect}} of a job in Pisa, Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff, who was engaged on the English translations of Marcel Proust's works. Believing that the job was his, Waugh resigned his position at Arnold House. He had meantime sent the early chapters of his novel to Acton for assessment and criticism. Acton's reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript; shortly afterwards, before he left North Wales, <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Moncrieff job had fallen through. The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide. He records that he went down to a nearby beach and, leaving a note with his clothes, walked out to sea. An attack by jellyfish changed his mind, and he returned quickly to the shore.|$|E
5|$|Promoted to {{the rank}} of brigadier, after the German {{surrender}} in North Africa, Wheeler was sent to Algiers where {{he was part of the}} staff committee planning the invasion of Italy. There, <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> India Office had requested that the army relieve him of his duties to permit him to be appointed Director General of Archaeology in India. Although he had never been to the country, he agreed that he would take the job on the condition that he be permitted to take part in the invasion of Italy first. As intended, Wheeler and his 12th Anti-Aircraft Brigade then took part in the invasion of Sicily and then mainland Italy, where they were ordered to use their anti-aircraft guns to protect the British 10th Corps. As the Allies advanced north through Italy, Wheeler spent time in Naples and then Capri, where he met various aristocrats who had anti-fascist sympathies.|$|E
5|$|When Atkinson {{arrived at}} Fort Armstrong on Rock Island on April 12, <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British Band was in Illinois, {{and that most}} of the Meskwakis he wanted to arrest were now with the band. Like other American officials, Atkinson was {{convinced}} that the British Band intended to start a war. Because he had few troops at his disposal, Atkinson hoped to get support from the Illinois state militia. He wrote to Governor Reynolds on April 13, describing—and perhaps purposely exaggerating—the threat that the British Band posed. Reynolds, who was eager for a war to drive the Indians out of the state, responded as Atkinson had hoped: he called for militia volunteers to assemble at Beardstown by April 22 to begin a thirty-day enlistment. The 2,100 men who volunteered were organized into a brigade of five regiments under Brigadier General Samuel Whiteside. Among the militiamen was 23-year-old Abraham Lincoln, who was elected captain of his company.|$|E

5|$|After ten days' investigation, Oxley was {{surprised}} to learn that the Gibraltar Police were handling the police investigation into the shootings, having been closely involved in the events leading up to them. He also grew concerned that the police investigation was insufficiently rigorous when <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> police had not taken statements from residents whose flats overlooked the scene of Farrell's and McCann's deaths. The Gibraltar coroner, Felix Pizzarello, welcomed This Weeks investigation, telling Oxley that he hoped the journalists would uncover witnesses who could assist the inquest. While Oxley was investigating the shootings from Gibraltar, Manyon travelled to Madrid in an attempt {{to learn more about the}} surveillance operation which took place in Spain prior to the shootings. Bolton added Alison Cahn to the team on 18 March; her task was to visit the flats which overlooked the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot, with the aim of interviewing any residents who might have witnessed the events of 6 March. After several days' work, the team found two eyewitnesses to the shootings who were willing to speak on camera: Stephen Bullock, a local lawyer who had witnessed the events while out for a walk with his wife; and Josie Celecia, a housewife who had seen the shooting of McCann and Savage from her apartment window. Both witnesses' statements appeared to the journalists to be inconsistent with the official account of the shootings.|$|E
25|$|Hooker's {{significant}} pursuit {{with the}} bulk of his army began on June 25, after <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Army of Northern Virginia had crossed the Potomac River.
