5|$|Croton oil (tiglium oil) <b>is</b> <b>pressed</b> {{from the}} seeds of Croton tiglium. Highly toxic, it was {{formerly}} used as a drastic purgative.|$|E
5|$|For {{internal}} broaching {{the sides of}} the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external broaching the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the broach <b>is</b> <b>pressed</b> against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If the tool holder rotates, the broach <b>is</b> <b>pressed</b> against the workpiece, but is driven by the tool holder.|$|E
5|$|Tigernut oil (or nut-sedge oil) <b>is</b> <b>pressed</b> {{from the}} tuber of Cyperus esculentus. It has {{properties}} similar to soybean, sunflower and rapeseed oils. It {{is used in}} cooking and making soap and has potential as a biodiesel fuel.|$|E
50|$|The vinyl {{pressing}} {{was limited}} to 5,018 copies. 1,010 <b>were</b> <b>pressed</b> on red marble vinyl and the other 4008 <b>were</b> <b>pressed</b> on standard black.|$|R
50|$|The vinyl was {{released}} in four versions as limited editions: 450 numbered copies <b>were</b> <b>pressed</b> on black vinyl. 50 numbered copies <b>were</b> <b>pressed</b> on black/white marbled vinyl for series subscribers. 100 'artist copies' <b>were</b> <b>pressed</b> on black/white marbled vinyl. 6 copies were released in a wooden box with a test pressing along with both black and marbled vinyl.|$|R

5|$|Bughouse {{is usually}} played using clock move, which allows {{touching}} of pieces. A move is completed {{only when the}} clock <b>is</b> <b>pressed.</b> Touch move is practiced to a lesser extent. When used, it applies to pieces in reserve as well; they are considered dropped after contact has been made with an empty square.|$|E
5|$|The 10th anniversary vinyl reissue of Illinois {{features}} the Marvel character Blue Marvel, who hails from Chicago, {{in place of}} Superman. Asthmatic Kitty obtained permission from Marvel to use the character's likeness. The Blue Marvel edition's artwork was created by Divya Srinivasan and <b>is</b> <b>pressed</b> on blue vinyl.|$|E
5|$|In {{some parts}} of the world (mainly Africa and South America), large ants, {{especially}} army ants, are used as surgical sutures. The wound <b>is</b> <b>pressed</b> together and ants are applied along it. The ant seizes the edges of the wound in its mandibles and locks in place. The body is then cut off and the head and mandibles remain in place to close the wound. The large heads of the dinergates (soldiers) of the leafcutting ant Atta cephalotes are also used by native surgeons in closing wounds.|$|E
5000|$|Four voice {{assignment}} modes, which, as well {{as simple}} one-VCO-per-voice polyphony, included the ability to affect four-VCO unison when one key <b>was</b> <b>pressed,</b> two VCOs per voice when two keys <b>were</b> <b>pressed,</b> and one VCO per voice when three or four keys <b>were</b> <b>pressed.</b> This effect can be heard on tracks such as [...] "Seconds" [...] by The Human League and [...] "I Dream of Wires" [...] by Gary Numan.|$|R
25|$|The text-block <b>was</b> <b>pressed.</b>|$|R
50|$|A manual {{safety is}} located {{at the front of the}} trigger guard. To set on Safe, the button must <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> {{rearward}} from the front; to set on Fire, the button must <b>be</b> <b>pressed</b> forward from inside the trigger guard.|$|R
5|$|Kip {{manages to}} learn the code but is {{seemingly}} too late. Planet B shuts down, with the virtual world slowly being destroyed. However, they discover the reset button and attempt to enter the code. As they reach it, Schwartz appears and attempts to stop them, but he in turn is stopped by Cerberus. Cerberus helps Kip and Medly, having learned that he too is a rogue and had false memories implanted by the corporation to make him believe {{that he had a}} life outside Planet B. The code is activated and the button <b>is</b> <b>pressed,</b> resetting the whole of Planet B.|$|E
5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal <b>is</b> <b>pressed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The cycle repeats at a {{frequency}} relative to {{how long it}} takes a wave to travel to the first open hole and back twice (i.e. four times the length of the pipe). For example: when all the holes bar the very top one are open (i.e. the trill 'B' key <b>is</b> <b>pressed),</b> the note A4 (440 Hz) is produced. This represents a repeat of the cycle 440 times per second.|$|E
5000|$|... (4) Caps Lock light. The Caps Lock key has <b>been</b> <b>pressed.</b> All keys <b>pressed</b> will <b>be</b> uppercase. <b>Press</b> Caps Lock {{again to}} unlock.|$|R
5000|$|... "Right Dead Back on It" [...] - Available as a B-side to [...] "Crush (1980 Me)" [...] in Australia only. After 15,000 {{copies of}} the single <b>were</b> <b>pressed,</b> the track <b>was</b> removed for unknown {{copyright}} reasons, and new copies <b>were</b> <b>pressed</b> without it.|$|R
5000|$|... (3) Insert. The Insert key has <b>been</b> <b>pressed.</b> Characters {{after the}} cursor while shift right when text <b>is</b> keyed. <b>Press</b> Insert again to cease Insert Mode.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} day, a {{panel is}} {{held for the}} office so that audience members can ask them questions. Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) openly states his distaste for the documentary. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) <b>is</b> <b>pressed</b> with questions about why she did not allow Jim to follow his dream after he has paid her so many romantic gestures. Jim attempts repeatedly to disperse the resulting tension. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) finally meets her birth parents (Ed Begley, Jr. and Joan Cusack) who had put her up for adoption.|$|E
5|$|The game {{contains}} {{two types of}} bonus stages accessed by passing a checkpoint with at least 20 rings. The first type has Sonic or Knuckles orbit floating, glowing spheres, jetting off each one when a button <b>is</b> <b>pressed,</b> while a fence of light approaches from the bottom and will remove the player from the stage if touched. Collecting 50 rings in this stage earns the player a continue. The second type involves bouncing around {{a room with a}} slot machine in its center with the intention of winning extra lives and power-ups.|$|E
5|$|After the E.coli outbreak, Odwalla {{improved}} {{the safety of}} several of its production processes. Before the fruit enters the factory, it is washed, sorted and sanitized. Once it has reached the plant, the apples, carrots, and citrus fruits are separated and washed again. The fruit <b>is</b> <b>pressed</b> to get the juice, which is then flash pasteurized and bottled. A sample undergoes quality testing, and, if it passes, the batch is shipped in refrigerated trucks to various distribution centers in the United States. Odwalla juice has a relatively short shelf life compared to other beverages and thus must be refrigerated. However, after the introduction of flash pasteurization in 1996 and a new plastic bottle in 2001, the shelf life has been considerably extended. Generally, Odwalla products are sold in special Odwalla-brand displays at grocery and convenience stores, instead of being intermixed with other products.|$|E

5|$|In Journey, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} a robed figure in a desert. After an {{introductory}} sequence, the player is shown the robed figure sitting in the sand, with a large mountain in the distance. The path towards this mountain, the ultimate destination of the game, is subdivided into several sections traveled through linearly. The player can walk in the levels, as well as control the camera, which typically follows behind the figure, either with the analog stick or by tilting the motion-sensitive controller. The player can jump with one button, or emit a wordless shout or musical note with another; the length and volume of the shout depends on how the button <b>is</b> <b>pressed,</b> and the note stays in tune with the background music. These controls are presented pictorially {{in the beginning of the}} game; at no point outside of the credits and title screen are any words shown or spoken.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, {{a single}} rank of pipes {{may be able}} to be {{controlled}} by several stops, allowing the rank to be played at multiple pitches or on multiple manuals. Such a rank is said to be unified or borrowed. For example, an 8 Diapason rank may also be made available as a 4 Octave. When both of these stops are selected and a key (for example, c) <b>is</b> <b>pressed,</b> two pipes of the same rank will sound: the pipe normally corresponding to the key played (c), and the pipe one octave above that (c). Because the 8 rank does not have enough pipes to sound the top octave of the keyboard at 4 pitch, it is common for an extra octave of pipes used only for the borrowed 4 stop to be added. In this case, the full rank of pipes (now an extended rank) is one octave longer than the keyboard.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{component}} {{sound of a}} Hammond organ comes from a tonewheel. Each one rotates {{in front of an}} electromagnetic pickup. The variation in the magnetic field induces a small alternating current at a particular frequency, which represents a signal similar to a sine wave. When a key <b>is</b> <b>pressed</b> on the organ, it completes a circuit of nine electrical switches, which are linked to the drawbars. The position of the drawbars, combined with the switches selected by the key pressed, determines which tonewheels are allowed to sound. Every tonewheel is connected to a synchronous motor via a system of gears, which ensures that each note remains at a constant relative pitch to every other. The combined signal from all depressed keys and pedals is fed through to the vibrato system, which is driven by a metal scanner. As the scanner rotates around a set of pickups, it changes the pitch of the overall sound slightly. From here, the sound is sent to the main amplifier, and on to the audio speakers.|$|E
5000|$|The 12-inch vinyl {{version of}} “Mono” <b>was</b> <b>pressed</b> just once, in 2001. Only 1,110 copies <b>were</b> <b>pressed</b> and {{released}} by Buddyhead. The CD version was originally released by Crank! Records in the U.S., {{after which the}} album was quickly bought back by the band, and then re-pressed and re-released on Buddyhead. These second, and further CD pressings, had slightly altered artwork, including an alternate font on the cover. Seeing as how the LP <b>was</b> <b>pressed</b> {{at the time of}} the original CD release, this explains why the covers for Buddyhead’s 5th release on both CD and LP don’t match.|$|R
50|$|Only about 2,500 copies <b>were</b> <b>pressed</b> in the {{original}} 1970 issue.|$|R
50|$|The records <b>were</b> <b>pressed</b> in Japan {{to ensure}} perfect sound quality.|$|R
5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{in which}} the player uses a rifle-shaped light gun to fire at targets on the screen. One duck at a time flies across the screen, with each duck {{appearing}} {{in a different place}} {{on the sides of the}} screen and flying in different paths. The player is allowed three shots to hit the duck as it flies across the screen. As with other light gun games, a hit is registered if the gun is pointed at the duck or similar light source when the trigger is pulled; no projectile is fired. When a shot is fired, a mark appears on the screen where the player was aiming; if the shot misses the duck, it changes direction away from the bullet. If the player hits a duck, it falls to the ground, and a hunting dog runs over and collects it. Each duck hit adds a small image of a duck to a row at the top of the screen. An screen overlay shows an image of marsh reeds and a tree branch. The gun is attached to the game cabinet by a metal cord, and is holstered in a small circular recess in the cabinet when not in use. Attempting to remove the gun sounds an alarm buzzer. Each game costs a quarter, and runs until the time limit runs out. Machines have adjustable time limits or can be set to run each game indefinitely, starting the score count over when the start button <b>is</b> <b>pressed.</b>|$|E
