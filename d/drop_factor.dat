This {{is due to the}} typically large distances between the different plants and the flow across plant elevations and equipment, including heat exchangers.

40|$|Solid {{propellant}} gas generators that have high gas capacity {{are used for}} fast pressurization of inflatable devices or elastic shells. However, many applications such as control surface actuation, air bottle pressurization in rocket engines and safety systems of automobiles (airbags) require exit gases at near ambient temperature. A scheme suitable for short duration applications is passive cooling of gas generator gases by using a packed bed as compact heat exchanger. A study indicated that the mass flow rates of solid {{propellant gas}} generators for applications such as air bottle pressurization and control system actuators were {{of the order of}} 1 kg/s. Since pressure and enthalpy drop correlations for packed beds with mass flow rates (~ 1 kg/s) and packing sphere based Reynolds number (Red) ~ 9 X 104 were unavailable in open literature, an experimental investigation was deemed necessary. The objectives of the present study were (a) characterization of packed beds for pressure and enthalpy drop, (b) develop Euler and Nusselt number correlations at Red~ 105 and (c) evolve an engineering procedure for estimation of packed bed pressure and enthalpy drop. An experimental test facility with a hydrogen-air combustor was designed and fabricated for this purpose to characterize a variety of packed beds for pressure drop and heat transfer. Flow through separate packed beds consisting of 9. 5 mm and 5 mm steel spheres and lengths ~ 200 mm and ~ 300 mm were studied in the sphere based Reynolds numbers (Red) range of 0. 4 X 104 to 8. 5 X 104. The average porosity (є) of the randomly packed beds was ~ 0. 4. The ratios of packed bed diameter to packing diameter for 9. 5 mm and 5 mm sphere packing were ~ 9. 5 and 18 respectively. The inlet flow temperature was unsteady and a suitable arrangement using mesh of spheres was used at either ends to eliminate flow entrance and exit effects. Stagnation pressures were measured at entry and exit of the packed beds. The pressure <b>drop</b> <b>factor</b> fpd, (ratio of Euler number (Eu) to packed bed dimensions) for packed bed with 9. 5 mm spheres exhibited an asymptotically decreasing trend with increasing Reynolds number, and a correlation for the pressure <b>drop</b> <b>factor</b> is proposed as, fpd=Eu/ [6 (1 -є) (L/dp) ] = 125. 3 Red- 0. 4; 0. 8 X 104 < Red < 8. 5 X 104 (9. 5 mm sphere packing). However, for packed beds with 5 mm spheres the pressure <b>drop</b> <b>factor</b> fpd, was observed to increase in the investigated Reynolds number range. The correlation based for pressure <b>drop</b> <b>factor</b> is proposed as, fpd= Eu/ [6 (1 -є) (L/dp) ] = 0. 0479 Red 0. 37; 0. 4 X 104 < Red < 3. 9 X 104 (5 mm sphere packing). The pressure <b>drop</b> <b>factor</b> was observed to be independent of the inlet flow temperature. Gas temperatures were measured at the entry, exit and at three axial locations along centerline in the packed beds. The solid packing temperature was measured at three axial locations in the packed bed. At Red~ 104, the influence of gas phase and solid phase thermal conductivity on heat transfer coefficient was found to be negligible based on order of magnitude analysis and solid packing temperature data obtained from the experiments. Evaluation of sphere based Nusselt number (Nud) at axial locations in the packed bed indicated a length effect on the heat transfer coefficient, which was a function of Reynolds number and size of spheres used in packing. The arithmetic average of Nusselt numbers at different axial locations in the packed bed were correlated as Nud= 3. 85 Red 0. 5; 0. 5 X 104 < Red < 8. 5 X 104. The Nusselt numbers obtained in the experiments were consistent with corresponding literature data available at lower Reynolds numbers. In this experimental study Euler number correlations for pressure drop and Nusselt number correlations for heat transfer were obtained for packed beds at Red~ 105. An engineering model for estimation of packed bed pressure and enthalpy drop was evolved, which is useful for sizing of packed bed heat exchanger in solid propellant gas generation systems...|$|E

Unlike wired networks, random packet loss due to bit errors is not negligible in wireless networks, and this causes significant performance degradation of transmission control protocol (TCP). We propose and study a novel end-to-end congestion control mechanism called TCP Veno that is simple and effective for dealing with random packet loss. A key ingredient of Veno is that it monitors the network congestion level and uses that information to decide whether packet losses are likely to be due to congestion or random bit errors. Specifically: 1) it refines the multiplicative decrease algorithm of TCP Reno [...] -the most widely deployed TCP version in practice [...] -by adjusting the slow-start threshold according to the perceived network congestion level rather than a fixed <b>drop</b> <b>factor</b> and 2) it refines the linear increase algorithm so that the connection can stay longer in an operating region in which the network bandwidth is fully utilized. Based on extensive network testbed experiments and live Internet measurements, we show that Veno can achieve significant throughput improvements without adversely affecting other concurrent TCP connections, including other concurrent Reno connections. In typical wireless {{access networks}} with 1 % random packet loss rate, throughput improvement of up to 80 % can be demonstrated.

TCP/IP has been the underlying communication protocols enabling these applications. Despite the widespread deployment of the protocols, TCP/IP continues to be a hot research topic among R&D teams in the academia as well as the industry. Much of the recent work has been centered on adapting the protocols for use in wireless environments because of its ease of deployment, convenience to users, and high bandwidth brought about by maturing of advanced technologies (e. g., 3 G and IEEE 802. 11 LAN). The next big wave [...] mobile Internet, in which wireless will play a necessary part of the Internet infrastructure [...] is around the corner. The original TCP design assumes packet loss is always induced by congestion. This assumption can lead to significant performance degradation in wireless networks where random loss due to environmental noise is rampant. The detrimental effect of random loss on TCP performance is a well-known outstanding problem that remains to be unsolved. This dissertation proposes and studies a novel end-to-end congestion control mechanism called TCP Veno that is able to deal with random loss effectively. Veno differs from the conventional TCP in a major way: it monitors the congestion level using an end-to-end estimation algorithm and uses that knowledge to refine the congestion control algorithm of TCP.

This study is about on choosing the best reservoir designs {{that need to be}} implement in flume project, to choose the best the design, there are analysis that need to be done, stress and strain analysis, CFD analysis and costing analysis also should be include. Throughout the analysis, the main parameter of choosing reservoir design can be recognize, in this study there are two main parameters for choosing the best tank design that is, pressure drop and costing. The need of reservoir generally in term of costing for the whole project is because a costly pipe material would be required to withstanding a very high pressure in a very long pipe system. Therefore using reservoir is more economical compare to costly pipeline material, but in term of reservoir costing only, the variable that we can change is the volume of material use and also price of material. The volume of material used is depends on the dimension of the design and the dimension is depends on the criteria that this project need for reservoir section, to reduce volume material used, a single, double, and triple design is rational to be proposed. Choosing a right material need several analysis to be done, firstly throughout the CFD analysis, the data for maximum total pressure across wall can be obtain and with this data, a stress and strain analysis will be perform using a different grade of concrete, in this project the material used is concrete because it cannot be corroded since the fluid medium will be water so corrosion aspect is important. With stress and strain analysis, the maximum deflection data for each design can be obtain, the maximum deflection is like the safety level for the material use, the less deflection the more level of safety of the material, hence an optimum material with less price but strong can be choose, in this study the most suitable material to be use is grade 10 ready mix concrete. For pressure <b>drop</b> <b>factor,</b> it is depends on the design, in this study the design that have been proposed is parshall design, rectangular design and circular design varied with single, double and triple tank.

Small diameter copper tubes are more desirable in applications with higher pressures. For tubes of the same thickness, smaller diameter tubes can withstand higher pressures than larger diameter tubes. Hence, as tube diameters decrease, burst pressures increase.

By designing coils with shorter tube lengths, less work is required to circulate the refrigerant.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a {{numerical}} method {{was developed to}} investigate the heat transfer performance of a spiral heat exchanger. In the spiral heat exchanger, two long metal strips are wound concentrically to create hot-flow channel and cold-flow channel. The flow of the two fluids through a spiral heat exchanger was considered counter-current, the hot-flow circulates counter-clockwise and the cold-flow circulates clockwise. The upper surface, lower surface and outer-most side of the spiral heat exchanger were assumed to be insulated. A heat transfer effectiveness and an exergy recovery effectiveness were defined and evaluated based on the calculated non-dimensional temperatures of the two counter-flow fluids in the heat exchanger. At small NTU value, the heat transfer effectiveness value initially increases with the NTU value; while at higher NTU values, after reaching the maximum heat transfer effectiveness, the heat transfer effectiveness value starts to slightly decrease. For a set of Nt and NTU values, the heat transfer effectiveness reaches a minimum value at C*= 1. 0. As the C* approaches zero or infinity, the heat transfer effectiveness would approach the maximum. Conversely, {{for a set of}} NTU, Nt, inlet temperature of hot flow and cold flow, and overall pressure <b>drop</b> <b>factor</b> values, as the C* approaches zero or infinity, the exergy recovery effectiveness of the spiral heat exchanger is at the minimum. The exergy recovery effectiveness reaches a maximum as the C* value nears 1. 0. The result also shows that, at small values of Nt (Nt < 40), the heat transfer effectiveness value and the exergy recovery effectiveness value slightly increase with the Nt value; while these two values remain almost the same when the number of turns is larger than 40 turns.
