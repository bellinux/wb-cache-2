40|$|We {{examine how}} the {{possibility}} of a bank run affects the deposit contract offered and the investment decisions made by a competitive bank. Cooper and Ross (1998) have shown that when the probability of a run is small, the bank will offer a contract that admits a bank-run equilibrium. We show that, in this case, the bank will chose to hold an amount of liquid reserves exactly equal to what withdrawal demand will be if a run does not occur. In other words, precautionary or "excess" liquidity will not be held. This result allows us to determine how {{the possibility of a}} bank run affects the level of <b>illiquid</b> <b>investment</b> chosen by a bank. We show that when the cost of liquidating investment early is high, the level of investment is decreasing in the probability of a run.

40|$|Short-term {{borrowing}} {{has often}} been blamed for precipitating financial crises. We argue that while the empirical association between a financial institution or country’s short-term borrowing and susceptibility to crises may, in fact, exist, the direction of causality is often precisely the opposite to the one traditionally suggested by commentators. Institutions like banks that want to enhance their ability to provide liquidity and credit to difficult borrowers have to borrow shortterm. Similarly countries that have poor disclosure rules and inadequate investor protections, have limited long-term debt capacity, and will find their borrowing becoming increasingly short-term as they finance <b>illiquid</b> <b>investment.</b> Thus it is the increasing illiquidity of the investment being financed (or the deteriorating credit quality of borrowers) that necessitates short-term financing, and causes the susceptibility to crises. In fact, once illiquid investments have been financed, rather than making the system more stable, a ban on short-term financing may precipitate a more severe crisis. Even a priori, a ban is not without adverse consequences – policy makers have to trade off the costs of decreased credit creation and investment against the benefits of greater stability.

40|$|Using {{a unique}} dataset of {{private equity funds}} {{over the last two}} decades, this paper {{analyzes}} the cash flow, return, and risk characteristics of private equity. Unlike previous studies, we have detailed cash flow data for each fund, rather than aggregate or accounting returns. We also know the exact timing of investments and capital returns to investors and the number and types of companies each fund invested in. We document the draw down and capital return schedules for the typical private equity fund, and show that it takes several years for capital to be invested, and over ten years for capital to be returned to generate excess returns. We provide several determining factors for these schedules, including existing investment opportunities and competition amongst private equity funds. In terms of performance, we document that private equity generates excess returns on the order of five to eight percent per annum relative to the aggregate public equity market. Moreover, while we estimate the betas of the private equity funds’ portfolios to be greater than one, we show that on a risk-adjusted basis the excess value of the typical private equity fund is on the order of 24 percent relative to the present value of the invested capital. One interpretation of this magnitude is that it represents compensation for holding a 10 -year <b>illiquid</b> <b>investment.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays {{at the intersection of}} macroeconomics and corporate finance. The broad theme that links the three chapters is the study of how endogenous borrowing constraints that affect firms and financial intermediaries influence aggregate investment. In Chapter I, the existing theoretical framework studying how financial constraints in firms may make economies more sensitive to shocks (the 'financial accelerator') is extended to take account of firms' precautionary investment behaviour when they anticipate future liquidity constraints. This behaviour is at the source of a powerful amplification mechanism of shocks, and is also able to account for the documented dynamics of the composition of investment across the business cycle: in particular how risky, <b>illiquid</b> <b>investment</b> as a share of total investment fluctuates both at the firm and at the aggregate level. Chapter II studies how the public supply of liquidity affects the private creation of liquidity by firms (inside liquidity), and how this interacts with firms' demand for liquidity to influence investment and capital accumulation. The conditions under which government debt may boost or reduce private investment are shown to depend on three channels: (1) a crowding-in effect, by enhancing aggregate liquidity, (2) a crowding-out effect, by reducing the collateral value of entrepreneurial assets and (3) a redistributive effect. The model also shows how a production economy with endogenous liquidity can help resolve some important asset pricing puzzles. Finally, the business cycle properties of the model are studied. Chapter III shows how recent developments in financial markets may have made economies less vulnerable to banking crises as they widen access to liquidity, but by relaxing financial constraints facing financial intermediaries, they imply that, should a crisis occur, its impact could be more severe than previously. These effects may be reinforced by greater macroeconomic stability. Finally, financial intermediaries are shown to under-insure and over-borrow from a constrained-efficient viewpoint...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the economic {{consequences of the}} implementation of a particular aspect of Basel III in the U. S. Specifically, the Basel III proposal and the corresponding U. S. rule (hereafter referred to as the removal of the AOCI filter) to make the inclusion of unrealized fair value gains and losses of available-for-sale (AFS) securities in regulatory capital mandatory for all banks was highly controversial. The regulators' view that such an inclusion would result in greater bank regulatory discipline was met with the concern that the regulatory costs of such regulatory tightening would exceed any possible benefits. Specifically, opponents of this rule argue that the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses would result in unrealistic volatility in regulatory capital and would force banks to make costly changes to their investment and risk management behavior. Using a comprehensive sample of U. S. banks we provide three pieces of evidence: First, we find that inclusion of unrealized fair value gains and losses on AFS securities for the period 2009 to 2013 would have resulted in increased volatility of regulatory capital. Second, bank share prices reacted negatively (positively) to pronouncements that increased (decreased) the likelihood that this rule would be implemented and these market reactions are strongly positively related to the relative amount of unrealized gains and losses. Third, we find evidence that banks affected by the AOCI filter removal (i. e., advanced approaches banks) changed their investment portfolio management. Specifically, affected banks reduce the maturity of their investment portfolio and decrease the proportion of AFS securities more significantly than unaffected benchmark banks. Interestingly, our results also suggest that affected banks reduce the size of their <b>illiquid</b> <b>investment</b> securities held in the AFS category more than unaffected banks. Given that we observe these changes before the actual implementation date of the new rule, we believe our results speak to the ex ante effects of fair value accounting on banks' risk taking behavior...|$|E
40|$|The {{first chapter}} in my thesis investigates the {{association}} between selected hedge fund characteristics and persistence in performance over time. Analyzing TASS data from 1996 - 2006, I observe {{a positive correlation between}} persistence in good performance and fund size, as well as age. Furthermore, I find that more <b>illiquid</b> <b>investment</b> strategies exhibit significantly stronger persistence in good performance, both in the short and long run, even after controlling for illiquidity risk. These results indicate that higher fund size, age, and exposure to illiquidity are reflective of superior managerial skill. Finally, I note that funds with higher incentive fees display greater persistence in both good and bad (post-fee) performance in the long run. These findings are consistent with a scenario in which incentive fees are raised by both skilled and unskilled, (but lucky), fund managers in response to good past performance. Therefore, my analysis suggests that incentive fees for hedge funds may be endogenously determined. The second chapter tests a simple explanation for momentum profits: systematic out performance arises because certain stocks have persistently strong fundamentals which are not fully valued by the market. We find that "winner" portfolios have higher book-to-market ratios than "loser" portfolios, and the economic and statistical significance of momentum profits is markedly reduced when calculated above value benchmarks. A large component of the returns to relative strength portfolios may thus stem from such portfolios overweighting high value stocks, suggesting a close relation between the value and momentum anomalies. The final chapter develops a measure of international financial contagion using a semi structural approach. (cont.) In particular, we work with a multi-country dynamic equilibrium setting, placing a constraint on portfolio volatility. The tightening of this constraint is a channel through which shocks are propagated globally in our model. We then derive a measure of the tightness of the constraint, or 'contagion', using cross-equation restrictions. We finally evaluate our measure of international contagion with regards to its predictability on global asset price co-movement, as well as on news about the recent sub-prime crisis. We find evidence that our contagion estimator is a strong measure of the sub-prime crisis in this regard. by Pavithra Kamakshi Kumar. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This {{work was}} {{inspired}} by three factors: as real estate increasingly becomes a global investment option, investors around the world {{turn their attention to}} real estate emerging markets, such as the Latin American one, looking for i) attractive returns, ii) diversification and iii) the option of liquidity. The latter characteristic, which has been -at varying degrees- more and more required by investors, is crucial in determining the investment strategy regarding target allocation for each real estate asset class. It is crucial because, although every asset class behaves differently, real estate is an <b>illiquid</b> <b>investment</b> by nature; it involves a large amount of capital, whose return {{comes in the form of}} both yield and appreciation, resulting in lengthy due diligence periods and costly transactions. Is important to note that attractive returns in emerging real estate markets do not always come easy; the lack of transparency and information in these markets is, many times, the toughest barrier to break. This document proposes a methodology, based on economic models and mathematical procedures, to jump across the information barrier. With this in mind, this thesis explores Real Estate Open-ended Funds and REITs, the principal real estate investment vehicles that provide liquidity to investors, in order to outline the specific characteristics that the underlying assets of a liquid real estate fund in Latin America should have. Once the characteristics are defined, the document analyzes the historic performance of different asset classes and sub-classes to narrow the investment spectrum. The analysis was done on US data, as no historic real estate information is currently available for Latin America. Through a set of equations that resulted from a regression analysis based on the Four Quadrant Model (4 Q) 1, the performance of three selected retail asset sub-types in the US was projected to six Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru). The final product of this work is the proposal of an investment portfolio, based on the projected performance of three retail asset sub-types across six Latin American countries. The investment portfolio was calculated based on the modern portfolio theory (MPT) 2. by Andres Martinez. Thesis (S.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} and compares the performance, performance persistence and fund flows for UK equity unit trusts/OEICs and UK equity unit-linked personal pensions over the sample period January 1980 to December 2007. Unit-linked {{personal pension funds}} are an <b>illiquid</b> <b>investment</b> from the investorâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s perspective since any invested capital is inaccessible until retirement whereas for unit trusts/OEICs capital invested can be withdrawn at any time. Since decreasing returns to scale from fund flows are the equilibrating mechanism in Berk and Green (2004) that results in no persistence in performance the illiquid nature of unit-linked personal pension funds should ensure more evidence of performance persistence in comparison to unit trusts/OEICs. I find significant evidence using performance ranked portfolio strategies that underlying portfolios that are only composed of unit-linked personal pension funds have greater performance persistence than unit-linked personal pension funds that have underlying portfolios that also include at least a unit trust/OEIC. This evidence is consistent with Berk and Green (2004) since the illiquid nature of personal pension funds results in an attenuated performance fund flow relationship restricting the equilibrating mechanism. However, there are anomalies in the performance persistence results in relation to Berk and Green (2004) {{but it could be}} due to the differential between the number of non-surviving unit trusts/OEICs and non-surviving unit-linked personal pension funds. I also find that the performance fund flow relationship based on abnormal returns from a Carhart four factor model for both UK equity unit trusts/OEICs and UK unit-linked personal pensions is convex but the performance fund flow relationship is more attenuated for the unit-linked personal pension funds. For the worst performing unit trusts/OEICs there are outflows on average whereas for unit-linked personal pensions there are fund inflows on average. For performance persistence tests conditional on underlying portfolio fund flows unit trusts/OEICs that have the worst performance but the lowest net fund flows in the ranking period have significantly greater subsequent performance in comparison to the unit trusts/OEICs that have the worst performance but the highest net fund flows in the ranking period. This empirical evidence provides support for Berk and Green (2004) but for the unit-linked personal pension funds the evidence is less convincing. There is very little evidence that UK equity unit-trusts/OEICs or UK equity unit-linked personal pensions produce abnormal returns. These results are robust across the single index (CAPM) model, the Fama and French three factor model and the Carhart four factor model for both conditional and unconditional models. There is also no evidence that unit trusts/OEICs or unit-linked personal pension funds can time the market. There is a significantly negative timing effect across unconditional factor models which becomes insignificant for the conditional models. There is also no evidence that unit trusts/OEICs have significantly different performance than unit-linked personal pension funds...|$|E
