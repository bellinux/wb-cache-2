500|$|Alaphilippe's second-place finish was {{the best}} for any French rider since Laurent Jalabert in 1998. He had entered the race in support of Kwiatkowski. When Kwiatkowski was {{struggling}} on the Côte de Saint-Nicolas, the Etixx-Quick Step directeur sportif sent a radio message to Alaphilippe to ride for himself; this {{was similar to the}} events in La Flèche Wallonne, where Alaphilippe also finished second to Valverde. He was frustrated on the finish line and waved his arm in the air; he said after the race [...] "today I really felt <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> something more". Cyclingnews.com suggested after the race that he had the potential to win a Monument in the future.|$|E
500|$|In December 2011, Jenkins {{exited the}} project, citing [...] "creative differences". She stated, [...] "I {{have had a}} great time working at Marvel. We parted on very good terms, and I look forward to working with them again." [...] Jenkins felt she could not have made a good film [...] "out of Thor 2 because I wasn’t the right director... I could have made a great Thor if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> the story that I was wanting to do. But I don’t think I was the right person to make a great Thor out of the story they wanted to do." [...] Jenkins had {{intended}} to create a film based on the premise of Romeo and Juliet, where Jane was stuck on Earth with Thor forbidden to come save her. After Thor eventually does travel to Earth, he and Jane would have discovered that Malekith was [...] "hiding the dark energy inside of Earth because he knows that Odin doesn't care about Earth, and so he's using Odin's disinterest in Earth to trick him." ...|$|E

500|$|Phillip Atwell {{directed}} the music video on December 10–11, 2002. Almost all the film footage {{was used in}} the video except for a scene where 50 Cent raps in a glass box. The video is set in a fictional hip hop boot camp known as the Shady/Aftermath Artist Development Center. It begins with a black Hummer driving to the facility at an unknown location. Video clips from Eminem's single [...] "Without Me" [...] are seen playing in the entrance on flat screen TVs. We see Eminem & Dr. Dre looking down at the lab from a lab balcony with windows. 50 Cent is introduced by hanging upside down from the roof of a gym. Atwell commented, [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> better with it, but I really liked the way that it turned out". The video also contains a shooting range, which Atwell felt was appropriate because 50 Cent had been shot nine times. He said, [...] "creatively, I felt like we were able to put guns in a video and have it play. And I like it when you are able to play within the standards and still give the artist something symbolic of what they are going for." ...|$|E
500|$|... "You Are Not Alone" [...] is a R ballad {{about love}} and isolation. The song was written by R. Kelly and {{produced}} by Kelly and Jackson. Kelly wrote the song after losing close people in his life. Kelly was delighted {{to be able to}} work with his idol, explaining [...] "I was psyched... I feel <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> his whole album. Not being selfish. I was just that geeked about it. It was an experience out of this world... It's amazing to know that five years ago I was writing songs in a basement in the ghetto and now I'm writing for Michael Jackson... I'd be a fool not to say it's a dream come true." [...] Jackson contacted Kelly to see if he had any material available. Kelly forwarded a tape recording of the song and Jackson then agreed to work with Kelly on the piece. On the tape sent to Jackson, Kelly sung [...] "You Are Not Alone" [...] mimicking Jackson's vocal style, explaining, [...] "I think I am him. I become him. I want him to feel that as well." [...] Jackson found the interpretation amusing. They spent the last week of November 1994 together in the studio working on the track.|$|E
500|$|Nesbitt's {{performance}} in Hear My Song had also impressed first-time screenwriter and film director Kirk Jones, who cast {{him in his}} 1998 feature film Waking Ned. Playing amiable pig farmer [...] "Pig" [...] Finn brought Nesbitt to international attention, particularly in the United States (where the film was released as Waking Ned Devine); the cast was nominated for the 1999 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Theatrical Motion Picture. In 1999, he appeared as the paramilitary [...] "Mad Dog" [...] Billy Wilson in The Most Fertile Man in Ireland (Dudi Appleton). The following year, he appeared in Declan Lowney's feature debut, Wild About Harry. Lowney had personally asked him {{to appear in the}} supporting role of cross-dressing Unionist politician Walter Adair. In 2001, he made his debut as a lead actor in a feature film in Peter Cattaneo's Lucky Break. He played Jimmy Hands, an incompetent bank robber who masterminds an escape from a prison by staging a musical as a distraction. On preparing for the role, Nesbitt said, [...] "Short of robbing a bank there wasn't much research <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> but we did spend a day in Wandsworth Prison and that showed the nightmare monotony of prisoners' lives. I didn't interview any of the inmates because I {{thought it would be a}} little patronising as it was research for a comedy and also because we were going home every night in our fancy cars to sleep in our fancy hotels." [...] The film was a commercial failure, despite receiving good feedback from test audiences in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|It was Clemens who cast Diana Rigg {{to replace}} departing star Honor Blackman in The Avengers. He was later quoted as saying, [...] "I didn't do Diana {{a very good}} service. It made her an {{international}} star but I think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> more for her {{as far as the}} script was concerned.
