MethodsThe dried methanolic extracts of mesocarp and epicarp of the fruit and their hexane, chloroform, <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> n-butanolic and aqueous fractions were subjected to antioxidant assays including ferric reducing antioxidant potential, 2, 2 ′-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid, reducing power capacity, 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl, lipid peroxidation inhibitory and phosphomolybdate assays. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were also determined. ResultsEthyl <b>acetate</b> <b>fractions</b> of epicarp and mesocarp had considerable amounts of phenolics (243. 50 and 109. 50 μg/mL of gallic acid equivalents, respectively). 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity of <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>fractions</b> of both the plant parts showed higher activity than vitamin C with IC 50 (0. 75 and 3. 91 mg, respectively). In phosphormolybdate assay, the hexane fractions of both the parts showed highest activity [1. 16 and 2. 99 μg/mL of ascorbic acid equivalents (AAE) for epicarp and mesocarp, respectively], mesocarp being much potent than epicarp. The n-butanolic fraction of mesocarp also showed much higher activity (1. 13 μg/mL AAE) than that of epicarp (0. 74 μg/mL AAE), while the chloroform and <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>fractions</b> of epicarp were also considerably potent. In ferric reducing antioxidant potential assay, the chloroform fractions of both the fruit parts were most active. The hexane fractions of both the parts showed highest activity in reducing power assay, epicarp being more potent than mesocarp. In 2, 2 ′-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid assay, the antioxidant activities of <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and chloroform <b>fractions</b> of both the parts were comparable to gallic acid and vitamin C. In lipid peroxidation inhibitory assay, all the samples were moderate to good activity sustainable over the period of 72 h, indicating the presence of both slow and fast releasing antioxidants. ConclusionsThe findings of the study suggest that epicarp is a better source of antioxidants than the mesocarp, and the <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>fractions</b> of both the parts contain higher contents of antioxidants...|$|R

40|$|The ethanol extract of Tephrosia purpurea Linn. (Family: Leguminosae) {{was found}} to {{significantly}} inhibit the carbon tetrachloride-induced lipid peroxidation in vivo and superoxide generation in vivo. The <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>fraction</b> of the same extract was studied for free radical scavenging and antilipid peroxidation activity. The IC 50 values {{in both of these}} in vitro assays were found to be significantly reduced for <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>fraction</b> compared with the ethanolic extract of the plant. The observation was further supported by comparing the in vivo antioxidant activity for both the ethanolic extract and its <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>fraction.</b> The study concluded that the ethanolic extract of T. purpurea exhibits antioxidant activity in vivo and the ethyl acetate soluble fraction has improved antioxidant potential than the extract...|$|E
40|$|Chamaemelum nobile (Asteraceae) {{commonly}} known as ‹Roman chamomile› is a medicinal plant used for numerous diseases in traditional medicine, although its anticancer activity is unknown. The present study was carried out to investigate the anticancer as well as apoptotic activity of <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>fraction</b> of C. nobile on different cancerous cell lines. The cells were treated with varying concentrations (0. 001 - 0. 25 mg/mL) of this fraction for 24, 48 and 72 h. Apoptosis induced in MCF- 7 cells following treatment with <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>fraction</b> was measured using Annexin V/PI, flowcytometry and western blotting analysis. The results showed that C. nobile <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>fraction</b> revealed relatively high antiproliferative activity on MCF- 7 cells; however, it caused minimal growth inhibitory response in normal cells. The involvement of apoptosis as {{a major cause of}} the fraction-induced cell death was confirmed by annexin-V/PI assay. In addition, <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>fraction</b> triggered the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by decreasing the Bcl- 2 as well as increasing of Bax protein expressions and subsequently increasing Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio. Furthermore, decreased proliferation of MCF- 7 cells {{in the presence of the}} fraction was associated with G 2 /M phase cell cycle arrest. These findings confirm that <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>fraction</b> of C. nobile may contain a diversity of phytochemicals which suppress the proliferation of MCF- 7 cells by inducing apoptosis. © 2016 by School of Pharmacy Shaheed Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} the {{cytotoxic}} test (LC 50) towards Artemia salina L. larvae of the partition <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>fractions</b> from methanol extracts and petroleum ether (PE) extracts of Pistiae folium. The leaves of Pistiae folium was extracted using solvents soxhletation with methanol solvent and petroleum ether solvent. Both extracts successively partitioned with n-hexane and <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> respectively. Identification of secondary metabolites was using phytochemical screening method and TLC (Thin Layer Chromatography). TLC analysis was using the eluent chloroform: methanol 3 : 1 by citroboric acid spot analysis. The cytotoxic activity was using Brine Shrimp Lethality Test (BSLT) method. The result of partition from methanol extracts was 6. 25 % and from PE extracts was 0. 69 %. The phytochemical screening test showed that it contained flavonoids, saponins and steroids. The TLC analysis identified flavonoid compounds. The cytotoxic activity (LC 50) of the <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> partition from methanol extracts and petroleum ether extracts of Pistiae folium were 79. 9298 mg/mL and 51. 7608 mg/mL, respectively.
