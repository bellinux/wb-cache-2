40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty-two {{consecutive}} patients admitted with acute stroke in a carotid distribution had venous blood taken for haematocrit (Hct), haemoglobin (Hb), white cell count (WCC) and urea estimations.

No association could be demonstrated between Hct levels and <b>fatality</b> at 4 or 12 weeks. Regression analysis demonstrated that only increasing age (P< 0. 05) and a raised WCC (P< 0. 005) were independent factors significantly associated with <b>fatality</b> at both 4 and 12 weeks.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether the reported higher case <b>fatality</b> in hospital after an acute cardiac event in women {{can be explained by}} sex differences in mortality before admission and in baseline risk factors. DESIGN: Analyses of data from a community based coronary heart disease register. SETTING: Auckland region, New Zealand. SUBJECTS: 5106 patients aged 25 - 64 years with an acute cardiac event leading to coronary death or definite myocardial infarction within 28 days of onset, occurring between 1986 and 1992. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Case <b>fatality</b> before admission, 28 day case <b>fatality</b> for patients in hospital, and total case <b>fatality</b> after an acute cardiac event. RESULTS: Despite a more unfavourable risk profile women tended to have lower case <b>fatality</b> before admission than men (crude odds ratio 0. 88; 95 % confidence interval 0. 77 to 1. 02). Adjustment for age, living arrangements, smoking, medical history, and treatment increased the effect of sex (0. 72; 0. 60 to 0. 86). After admission to hospital, women had a higher case <b>fatality</b> than men (1. 76; 1. 43 to 2. 17), but after adjustment for confounders this was reduced to 1. 18 (0. 89 to 1. 58). Total case <b>fatality</b> 28 days after an acute cardiac event showed no significant difference between men and women (0. 85; 0. 70 to 1. 02) CONCLUSIONS: The higher case <b>fatality</b> after an acute cardiac event in women admitted to hospital is largely explained by differences in living status, history, and medical treatment and is balanced by a lower case <b>fatality</b> before admission...|$|R
40|$|Background. Community-based {{registers}} {{participating in}} the MONICA Project of the World Health Organization show markedly different attack and death rates of coronary heart disease. This variation {{is a function of}} both the incidence and case <b>fatality</b> occurring within countries. The contribution of case <b>fatality</b> to the international variation in coronary heart disease mortality rates is not well understood. Methods and Results. The register data from eight study populations - Augsburg and Bremen in Germany, Auckland in New Zealand, Perth and Newcastle in Australia, and North Karelia, Kuopio, and Turku/Loimaa in Finland - were compared. All patients with definite myocardial infarction or coronary death aged 35 to 64 years occurring in the study populations in 1985 through 1989 are the basis for the case <b>fatality</b> calculations by different definitions: 28 -day case <b>fatality</b> for all cases, for hospitalized cases, and for hospitalized 24 -hour survivors; out-of- hospital case fatality; and 24 -hour case <b>fatality</b> for hospitalized cases. Differences in case <b>fatality</b> were much smaller than differences in attack and mortality rates in these populations. About two thirds of deaths occurred before the patients reached a hospital. The 28 -day case <b>fatality</b> ranged from 37 % for men in Perth to 58 % for women in Augsburg. Among those who reached the hospital alive, 28 -day case <b>fatality</b> was 13 % to 27 % for men and 20 % to 35 % for women. In those who survived 24 hours from the onset of symptoms, 28 - day case <b>fatality</b> was 8 % to 17 % for men and 12 % to 26 % for women. Conclusions. Differences in case <b>fatality</b> were not associated with differences in coronary mortality rates between these populations. As most deaths occurred before reaching a hospital, opportunities for reducing case <b>fatality</b> through improved hospital care are limited. This emphasizes the primary role of prevention in reducing coronary death rates...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relation of screening mammography to breast cancer incidence and case <b>fatality.</b> METHODS: In a sample of White female Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized in 1990 - 1991, age-adjusted breast cancer incidence and 2 -year case <b>fatality</b> rates were estimated and compared with the frequency of mammographic screening from a population-based survey. RESULTS: The average rates for incidence, case <b>fatality,</b> and mammography within 5 years in 29 states were 414 / 100, 000, 18. 8 %, and 59. 2 %, respectively. There was a positive state-level correlation between mammography rates and incidence and an inverse correlation between mammography and case <b>fatality.</b> CONCLUSIONS: High screening mammography rates in some states are associated with reduced breast cancer case <b>fatality</b> rates, presumably as a result of diagnosis of earlier stage cancers...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} the discovery of variables distinguishing Child Protective Services (CPS) maltreatment-related <b>fatality</b> cases from non-fatality CPS cases.

Findings resulted in three categories of predictive indicators: 1) more actionable and indicative of reduced risk, 2) mostly more actionable and indicative of increased risk, and 3) less actionable and indicative of increased risk. Implications for the field in terms of risk assessment, practices, and training are discussed, as are the implications for future research.
