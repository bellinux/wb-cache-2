50|$|Basic field {{stripping}} of the T1 rifle was simple: with the rifle unloaded and the mechanism held open, pressing on a stud {{on the underside}} of the crank would lock the breech return spring. The breech block head could then be guided up and out through inclined <b>guide</b> <b>ways</b> in the receiver and the crank then could be freed from the hinge pin, allowing the entire breech mechanism to be removed as a unit. The magazine housing would then be dismounted by pressing forward on the housing until the forward retaining lip would become free from the groove in the forward part of the receiver that it normally rested in and then rotating the housing downward. The entire trigger and feed mechanism group would then be removed by pressing a spring-loaded cross bolt at the rear of the trigger guard just below the stock; the entire assembly would then be freed to be pulled down and rearward to separate it from the receiver and stock. The general concept of the {{field stripping}} process is similar to that of the SKS carbine. The stock and barrel-receiver assembly would normally not be separated, following the pattern of rifles such as the German Model 98 Mauser or the Model 1903 Springfield.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe dynamic {{behavior}} of a machine tool structure directly influences key metal cutting performance like being able to quickly remove hard workpiece material during roughing or minimize unwanted oscillations during high speed movements in finishing. While structure conception is still funded on designer experience and inventiveness, Finite Element models are very effective in analyzing the conceived structure, allowing its optimization, in term of stiffness increase and/or mass reduction. While today FE models provide a satisfying description of structure distributed stiffness and inertia, machine damping is usually not represented or is approximated as a uniform viscous damping, with no precise reference to the actual dissipation phenomena occurring in the structure. The corresponding incertitude in the estimation of the overall dynamic {{behavior of}}ten strongly limits the possibility of delivering accurate absolute estimations of machine performance. In order to overcome this limitation, this work aims at adding key energy dissipation mechanisms into numerical structural models: the velocity loop of the axis position controller, the frictional forces acting on the axis kinematic chain and <b>guide</b> <b>ways</b> and a distributed modal damping. Experimental tests have been performed on a machine tool axis equipped with tunable roller plus plain friction <b>guide</b> <b>ways.</b> The proposed model shows how different components and phenomena contribute into increasing machine performance, in term of material removal capacity.

In this study, we have developed a knotter which is able to form a double sheet bend by using a set of molds. First, we designed a path to carve tracks on the surface of the mold by using the Dowker notation. But this path was too complicated to thread yarn through the path easily. Furthermore, it is desired that the knotter can be carried by a worker in rope mills. We, therefore, have moved and/or composed paths in order to obtain the simpler path for double sheet bends.
