These techniques use non-Cartesian sampling trajectories like radial, zigzag, and spiral. In the reconstruction procedure, usually interpolation methods are used to obtain missing samples on a regular grid. In this paper, we propose an iterative method for image reconstruction which uses the black marginal area of the image. The proposed iterative solution offers a great enhancement in the quality of the reconstructed image in comparison with conventional algorithms like zero filling and neural network. This method is applied on MRI data and its improved performance over other methods is demonstrated. 1...|$|E

50|$|Anti-aircraft gunners {{found that}} such small, {{fast-moving}} targets {{were difficult to}} hit. At first, it took, on average, 2,500 shells to bring down a V-1. The average altitude of the V-1, between 2,000 and 3,000 feet (610 and 915 m), was in a narrow band between the optimum engagement heights for light (such as the 40mm Bofors guns) and heavy anti-aircraft weapons. These low heights defeated the rate of traverse of the standard British QF 3.7 inch mobile gun, and static gun installations with <b>faster</b> <b>traverses</b> had to be built at great cost. The development of centimetric (roughly 30 GHz frequency) gun laying radars based on the cavity magnetron {{and the development of}} the proximity fuze helped to neutralise the advantages of speed and size which the V-1 possessed. In 1944 Bell Labs started delivery of an anti-aircraft predictor fire-control system based around an analogue computer (supplanting the previous electro-mechanical Kerrison Predictor) just in time for use in this campaign.|$|R
5000|$|Several ACOG {{models are}} {{designed}} to be used with the [...] "Bindon Aiming Concept", an aiming technique developed by Trijicon founder and optical designer Glyn Bindon. The technique is essentially using the illuminated part of the reticle and its focusing rear eyepiece as a collimator sight. As in any other collimator sight, the user does not actually look through the sight but instead keeps the collimated (infinity) image of the illuminated part of the reticle in focus with the dominant eye while the other eye views the entire field of view to acquire the target. In this both-eyes-open technique the brain superimposes the aiming reticle on the target. An added part of the technique is to shift focus after acquisition to the dominant eye/telescopic image for more accurate shooting. This overcomes the problem of centering or acquiring <b>fast</b> <b>traversing</b> targets common with all telescopic sights. Only certain models of the ACOG are designed with bright enough daylight-lit fiber optic or battery-powered LED reticles that facilitate this technique.|$|R

40|$|Approximate nearest {{neighbor}} search (ANNS) {{is a fundamental}} problem in machine learning and computer vision. An ANNS algorithm is required to be efficient on both memory use and search performance. Recently, graph based methods have achieved revolutionary performance on public datasets. The earliest approach GNNS is a greedy algorithm and based on a $k$-nearest-neighbor graph ($k$NN graph). The improvements of GNNS mainly focus on two aspects: (1) Some provide better initial search position to prevent the search from being stuck in local optima. (2) Others try to construct better graphs for <b>faster</b> <b>traversing</b> and neighbor locating. However, we find there exists three problems with these works, the unconnected cluster problem, the detouring problem and the large index problem (memory-inefficient for large scale search).

40|$|This paper explores {{means to}} {{increase}} efficiency in performing tasks with multi-robot teams, {{in the context of}} natural Human-Multi-Robot Interfaces (HMRI) for command and control. The motivating scenario is an emergency evacuation by a transport convoy of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) that have to traverse, in shortest time, an unknown terrain. In the experiments the operator commands, in minimal time, a group of rovers through a maze. The efficiency of performing such tasks depends on both, the levels of robots' autonomy, and the ability of the operator to command and control the team. The paper extends the classic framework of levels of autonomy (LOA), to levels/hierarchy of autonomy characteristic of Groups (G-LOA), and uses it to determine new strategies for control. An UGV-oriented command language (UGVL) is defined, and a mapping is performed from the human-friendly gesture-based HMRI into the UGVL. The UGVL is used to control a team of 3 robots, exploring the efficiency of different G-LOA; specifically, by (a) controlling each robot individually through the maze, (b) controlling a leader and cloning its controls to followers, and (c) controlling the entire group. Not surprisingly, commands at increased G-LOA lead to a <b>faster</b> <b>traverse,</b> yet a number of aspects are worth discussing in this context. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

25|$|The second {{modification}} was {{the requirement}} {{that one of the}} ice giants and Jupiter encounter Jupiter causing its semi-major axis to jump. In this jumping-Jupiter scenario an ice giant encounters Saturn and is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit, causing Saturn's orbit to expand; then encounters Jupiter and is scattered outward, causing Jupiter's orbit to shrink. This results in a step-wise separation of Jupiter's and Saturn's orbits instead of a smooth divergent migration. The step-wise separation of the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn avoids the slow sweeping of secular resonances across the inner solar System that resulted in the excitation of the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets and an asteroid belt with an excessive ratio of high- to low-inclination objects The encounters between the ice giant and Jupiter in this model allow Jupiter to acquire its own irregular satellites. Jupiter trojans are also captured following these encounters when Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps and, if the ice giant passes through one of the libration points scattering trojans, one population is depleted relative to the other. The <b>faster</b> <b>traverse</b> of the secular resonances across the asteroid belt limits the loss of asteroids from its core. Most of the rocky impactors of the Late Heavy Bombardment instead originate from an inner extension that that is disrupted when the giant planets reach their current positions, with a remnant remaining as the Hungaria asteroids. Some D-type asteroids are embedded in inner asteroid belt, within 2.5 AU, during encounters with the ice giant when it is crossing the asteroid belt.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOn 14 December 1999, a {{large-scale}} ULF wave event was observed by the Hankasalmi radar of the SuperDARN chain. Simultaneously, the FAST satellite {{passed through the}} Hankasalmi field-of-view, measuring the magnetic field oscillations of the wave at around 2000 km altitude, along with the precipitating ion and electron populations associated with these fields. A simple field line resonance model of the wave has been created and scaled using the wave's spatial and temporal characteristics inferred from SuperDARN and IMAGE magnetometer data. Here the model calculated field-aligned current is compared with field-aligned currents derived from the FAST energetic particle spectra and magnetic field measurements. This comparison reveals the small-scale structuring and energies of the current carriers in {{a large-scale}} Alfvén wave, a topic, which at present, is of considerable theoretical interest. When <b>FAST</b> <b>traverses</b> a region of the wave involving low upward field-aligned current densities, the current appears to be carried by unstructured downgoing electrons of energies less than 30 eV. A downward current region appears to be carried partially by upgoing electrons below the FAST energy detection threshold, but also consists of a mixture of hotter downgoing magnetospheric electrons and upgoing ionospheric electrons of energies < 30 eV, with the hotter upgoing electrons presumably representing those upgoing electrons which have been accelerated by the wave field above the low energy detection threshold of FAST.

Using identical process parameters, the effects of radiance of both the Nd 3 +:YAG laser and a fibre laser were compared thereon the two selected advanced ceramics. Both the lasers showed differences {{on each of the}} ceramics employed in relation to the microstructure and grain size as well as the dimensional size of the laser engineered tracks - notwithstanding the use of identical process parameters namely: spot size; laser power; traverse speed; Gaussian beam modes; gas flow rate and gas composition as well the wavelengths. From this it was evident that the difference in the laser-beam radiance between the two lasers would have {{had much to do with}} this effect. The high radiance fibre laser produced larger power per unit area in steradian when compared to the lower radiance of the Nd 3 +:YAG laser. This characteristically produced larger surface tracks through higher interaction temperature at the laser-ceramic interface. This in turn produced bigger melt-zones and different cooling rates which led to the change in the microstructure of both the Si 3 N 4 and ZrO 2 advance ceramics. Owing to this, it is now indicative that lasers with high radiance would result to much cheaper and cost effective laser assisted surface engineering processes, since lower laser power, <b>faster</b> <b>traverse</b> speeds, larger spot sizes could be used in comparison to lasers with lower radiance which require much slower traverse speed, higher power levels and finer spot sizes to induce the same effect thereon materials such as the advanced ceramics...|$|R
