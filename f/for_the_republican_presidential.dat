5|$|Having {{just been}} elected to the Senate with Sherman's support, Garfield entered the 1880 {{campaign}} season committed to Sherman as his choice <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>presidential</b> nominee. Even before the convention began, however, a few Republicans, including Wharton Barker of Philadelphia, thought Garfield {{the best choice for}} the nomination. Garfield denied any interest in the position, but the attention was enough to make Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant's ambitions. Besides Sherman, the early favorites for the nomination were Blaine and former president Grant, but several other candidates attracted delegates as well.|$|E

5|$|In 1874 Long {{chaired the}} state Republican convention, and finally won {{election}} to the state legislature. He formed {{a close relationship with}} Speaker John E. Sanford, and in what historian James Hess describes as a probable move of political calculation, supported the successful gubernatorial candidate in 1875, Alexander H. Rice, even though Rice supported liberal legislation on alcohol sales that Long opposed. He was able to parlay this support into his own {{election to the}} speakership in 1876. He widened his reform views to the national stage by supporting Benjamin Bristow in his unsuccessful bid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>presidential</b> nomination.|$|E

On May 5, 2012, at the 2012 Libertarian National Convention, Johnson received the Libertarian Party's official nomination {{for president in}} the 2012 election, {{by a vote of}} 419 votes to 152 votes for second-place candidate R. Lee Wrights. In his acceptance speech, Johnson asked the convention's delegates to nominate as his running mate Judge Jim Gray of California. Gray subsequently received the party's vice-presidential nomination on the first ballot.|$|E
5|$|Taft sent {{a special}} message to Congress {{on the need}} for a revamped {{antitrust}} statute when it convened its regular session in December 1911, but it took no action. Another antitrust case that had political repercussions for Taft was that brought against the International Harvester Company, the large manufacturer of farm equipment, in early 1912. As Roosevelt's administration had investigated International Harvester, but had taken no action (a decision Taft had supported), the suit became caught up in Roosevelt's challenge <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>presidential</b> nomination. Supporters of Taft alleged that Roosevelt had acted improperly; the former president blasted Taft for waiting three and a half years, and until he was under challenge, to reverse a decision he had supported.|$|E
