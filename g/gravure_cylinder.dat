50|$|Given that a blade is {{necessary}} to remove the excess ink from a cylinder which is continuously running, the blade/cylinder combination is designed such that it is (chiefly) the blade which wears away, not the cylinder. The doctor blade is cheap and disposable and the <b>gravure</b> <b>cylinder</b> or flexo anilox is relatively expensive. Typical materials for the blade are steel or plastic: gravure cylinders are normally hard-chrome plated and aniloxes may be chromed or ceramic.|$|E
50|$|Next, the {{substrate}} gets sandwiched between the impression roller and the gravure cylinder: {{this is where}} the ink gets transferred from the recessed cells to the web. The purpose of the impression roller is to apply force, ensuring that the entire substrate is brought into contact with the <b>gravure</b> <b>cylinder,</b> which in turn ensures even and maximum coverage of the ink. Once in contact with {{the substrate}}, the ink's surface tension pulls (part of) the ink out of the cell and transfers it to the substrate.|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{technologies}} for a fast and sufficient production of carbon based electrodes for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells are under research {{to follow the}} future demand of fuel cells for different applications. The main drives for this trend are governmental programs for the automotive industry. Printing technology has advantages for the continuous production of active electrodes caused by good patterning possibilities and high efficiency. This publication presents an adapted roll-to-roll gravure printing process. Due to the adaptation of the applied gravure structures disturbance factors are searched to quantify their influence on the production process. The influence of doctor-blade abrasion, nip pressure and ink drying within the <b>gravure</b> <b>cylinder</b> are evaluated with printing tests and following optical analysis according to amount and size of defects (pinholes) and layer thicknesses...|$|E
5000|$|Carbon {{tissue is}} a {{gelatin-based}} emulsion {{used as a}} photoresist in the chemical etching (photoengraving) of <b>gravure</b> <b>cylinders</b> for printing. This was introduced by British physicist and chemist Joseph Swan [...] in 1864. It {{has been used in}} photographic reproduction {{since the early days of}} photography.|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that the gravure process {{provides}} the best quality printed materials and the fastest production speed. The gravure process, {{as a matter of}} fact, is the only process which can utilize fully digital imaging technology. For instance, the Helio-Klischograph Model K 201 and K 202 incorporated with the Hell Chromacom System can engrave <b>gravure</b> <b>cylinders</b> directly without using any halftone films or bromides. Hell Co., Ltd., moreover, has been developing the electron beam engraving technique which employs digital imaging technology to engrave <b>gravure</b> <b>cylinders.</b> On the other hand, Crosfield Electronics Co., Ltd. introduced the Lasergravure process which also utilizes digital imaging technology to engrave <b>gravure</b> <b>cylinders.</b> However, these techniques represent very high costs for gravure printers. Only large companies can afford such investments. The gravure process, generally speaking, is the most expensive process, mainly due to the costs of printing cylinder preparation. To compensate for costly prepress, it is therefore used for high production runs. This constraint is the main disadvantage of the gravure process and has caused the gravure market to become smaller than its competitors web offset and flexography. Research in web offset and flexo has been successful in developing higher print quality, faster production speed and lower costs. Therefore, there are some companies which have been developing a method of making photopolymer-coated <b>cylinders</b> for <b>gravure</b> to reduce, not only the costs of the metal cylinders and the sophisticated equipment, but also the production time. The company that provided photopolymer material for this thesis claimed that its products can be commercially made as <b>gravure</b> <b>cylinders.</b> This photopolymer can be imaged by a conventional ultraviolet fluorescent lamp. Both the company and the author agreed that it might be feasible to utilize digital imaging technology to image this photopolymer. The author selected the Hell Chromagraph 399 ER Laser Scanner as a digital imaging source to image onto this photopolymer. After enormous efforts in the experiments, the argon ion laser on the Hell 399 ER was not able to image onto this photopolymer regardless of the laser intensity and the length of the exposure time because the spectral sensitivity of this photopolymer did not match the argon ion laser. The author, however, conducted further experiments to prove that this photopolymer can be imaged by a high-power UV-argon ion laser, but it is, at present, impractical for gravure printers. Some recommendations for further studies in this area are suggested...|$|R
50|$|<b>Gravure</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{are usually}} {{made of steel}} and plated with copper, though other materials, e.g. {{ceramics}} can also be used. The desired pattern is achieved by engraving with a laser or a diamond tool, or by chemical etching. If the cylinder is chemically etched, a resist (in {{the form of a}} negative image) is transferred to the cylinder before etching. The resist protects the non-image areas of the cylinder from the etchant. After etching, the resist is stripped off. The operation is analogous to the manufacture of printed circuit boards. Following engraving, the cylinder is proofed and tested, reworked if necessary, and then chrome plated.|$|R
40|$|Gravure {{printing}} process is chosen to meet high quality, long run jobs and end user expectations. This {{printing process}} {{is known for}} its versatility and print fidelity. Electromechanical engraving is one of the prominent methods of cylinder preparation. But due to complex combination of process parameters the occurrence of defects is inevitable while cylinder preparation. The presence of these defects consequences in degradation of quality which leads to rejection of cylinder. The occurrence of these problems is unavoidable but nevertheless it can be controlled and minimized by optimization of process parameter and variables. Thus the present study aims to address different defects and problems occurred during <b>gravure</b> <b>cylinder</b> preparation. Main objective of this research work is to highlight, how frequently various defects happen during electro-mechanical engraving of gravure cylinders...|$|E
40|$|Halftone gravure {{has become}} the {{accepted}} front end imaging procedure for the publication gravure industry. Halftone gravure refers to using screened or halftone film when imaging a <b>gravure</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This procedure has allowed the publication gravure industry {{to benefit from the}} prepress advantages of offset printing. Therefore, the possibilities of an allowable color tolerance between a halftone gravure print and a SWOP standard offset press proof in hue, saturation, and brightness needed to be studied. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether an allowable color tolerance could be achieved between the gravure production print and the SWOP standard offset press proof. The experimental design involved the research of the effects of clear extender varnish modifications of gravure inks used to produce an allowable color tolerance between a gravure print and a SWOP standard offset press proof. It was important to compare the gravure print to the SWOP standard offset press proof because the publication gravure industry recognized the SWOP standard offset press proof as the standard or control parameter. The methodology was based upon the modification of gravure inks by the addition of 10...|$|E
5000|$|The {{first step}} of Gravure is to create the {{cylinder}} with the engraved images {{that need to be}} printed: the engraving process will create on the cylinder surface the cells that will contain the ink in order to transfer it to the paper. Since the amount of ink contained in the cells corresponds to different colour intensities on the paper, the dimensions of the cells must be carefully set: deeper or larger cells will produce more intense colours whereas smaller cells will produce less intense ones. There are three methods of photoengraving that have been used for engraving of <b>gravure</b> <b>cylinders,</b> where the cell open size or the depth of cells can be uniform or variable: ...|$|R
