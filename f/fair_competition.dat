5|$|By May 1933, two draft bills had emerged, a {{cautious}} and legalistic one by John Dickinson (Under Secretary of Commerce) and an ambitious one focusing on trade associations by Hugh Johnson. Many leading businessmen—including Gerard Swope (head of General Electric), Charles M. Schwab (chairman of Bethlehem Steel Corporation), E. H. Harriman (chairman of the Union Pacific Railroad), and Henry I. Harriman, {{president of the}} U.S. Chamber of Commerce—helped draft the legislation. A two-part bill, the first section promoting cooperative action among business to achieve <b>fair</b> <b>competition</b> and provide for national planning and a second section establishing a national public works program, was submitted to Congress on May 15, 1933.|$|E
5|$|With {{the powers}} of the King's Clerk abolished, the bailiffs of Norwich set about {{regulating}} the operation of the market for what they felt was the greatest benefit to the city. To encourage <b>fair</b> <b>competition</b> among the market's traders, it was forbidden to sell foodstuffs before the Cathedral bell had tolled for Lady Mass (6.00am). The practice of forestalling (meeting merchants {{on their way to the}} market either to buy their goods for resale, or to prevent them from attending the market and thus make goods of the type they were selling scarce and hence more expensive) was forbidden. Trading anywhere other than in the market was strongly discouraged and the right to re-sell goods at a profit was restricted to Freemen of the city. The prices of bread and beer were fixed, and a set of standardised weights and measures was introduced, against which measures used by merchants would regularly be checked. Shortly after the transfer of the market to the city a market cross was erected near the centre of the main market (opposite the present day entrance to Davey Place), the design of which is not recorded.|$|E

25|$|United States {{antitrust}} {{law is a}} collection of federal and state government laws that regulates the conduct and organization of business corporations, generally to promote <b>fair</b> <b>competition</b> for the benefit of consumers. (The concept is called competition law in other English-speaking countries.) The main statutes are the Sherman Act 1890, the Clayton Act 1914 and the Federal Trade Commission Act 1914. These Acts, first, restrict the formation of cartels and prohibit other collusive practices regarded as being in restraint of trade. Second, they restrict the mergers and acquisitions of organizations that could substantially lessen competition. Third, they prohibit the creation of a monopoly and the abuse of monopoly power.|$|E
25|$|Under {{its unique}} {{macro-economic}} and political environment, the China {{has adopted a}} special telecommunications policy and strategy for telecommunications reform. As a fundamental and strategic industry, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) of China has monopolized telecommunication operations {{for more than four}} decades. Recognizing its incapability of monopolizing the huge market and of meeting increasing demand, China launched a telecommunications reform that has been aimed at full competition. As the result, the basic telecommunication market advanced from a monopoly to a duopoly, and it is now being extended to pluralistic competition. In 1994, China Unicom was formed and allowed to build and to operate nationwide cellular networks. To promote <b>fair</b> <b>competition</b> in the paging service, the paging sector of China Telecom was split in 1998 to form Guoxin Paging Ltd.|$|E
25|$|Owing to his {{prominence}} as an adjudicator of Jewish law, Rabbi Feinstein {{was asked}} {{the most difficult}} questions, in which he issued a number of innovative and controversial decisions. Soon after arriving in the United States, he established a reputation for handling business and labor disputes. For instance, he wrote about strikes, seniority, and <b>fair</b> <b>competition.</b> Later, he served as the chief Halakhic authority for the Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists, indicative of his expertise in Jewish medical ethics. In the medical arena, he opposed the early, unsuccessful heart transplants, although it is orally reported that in his later years, he allowed a person to receive a heart transplant (after the medical technique of preventing rejection was improved). On such matters, he often consulted with various scientific experts, including his son-in-law Rabbi Dr. Moshe David Tendler, who {{is a professor of}} biology and serves as a rosh yeshiva at Yeshiva University.|$|E

25|$|Para-alpine skiing {{classification}} is {{the classification}} system for para-alpine skiing designed to insure <b>fair</b> <b>competition</b> between alpine skiers with {{different types of}} disabilities. The classifications are grouped into three general disability types: standing, blind and sitting. Classification governance is handled by International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing. Skiers are classified based on medical assessment, and their body position when they ski. Blind skiers are evaluated purely on a medical assessment. Prior to that, several sport governing bodies dealt with classification including the International Sports Organization for the Disabled (ISOD), International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation (ISMWSF), International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) and Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA). Some classification systems are governed by bodies other than International Paralympic Committee Alpine Skiing for systems not used in international competition. The sport {{is open to all}} competitors with a visual or physical disability. It is not open to people with intellectual disabilities.|$|E

500|$|The {{legislation}} was enacted in June 1933 during the Great Depression in the United States {{as part of}} President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislative program. Section 7(a) of the bill, which protected collective bargaining rights for unions, proved contentious (especially in the Senate), but both chambers eventually passed the legislation. President Roosevelt signed the bill into law on June 16, 1933. The Act had two main sections (or [...] "titles"). Title I was devoted to industrial recovery, authorizing the promulgation of industrial codes of <b>fair</b> <b>competition,</b> guaranteed trade union rights, permitted the regulation of working standards, and regulated the price of certain refined petroleum products and their transportation. Title II established the Public Works Administration, outlined the projects and funding opportunities it could engage in. Title II also provided funding for the Act.|$|E
500|$|On April 13, 1934, the President had {{approved}} the [...] "Code of <b>Fair</b> <b>Competition</b> for the Live Poultry Industry of the Metropolitan Area in {{and about the}} City of New York." [...] The goal of the code was to ensure that live poultry (provided to kosher slaughterhouses for butchering and sale to observant Jews) were fit for human consumption and to prevent the submission of false sales and price reports. The industry was almost entirely centered on New York City. Under the new poultry code, the Schechter brothers were indicted on 60 counts (of which 27 were dismissed by the trial court), acquitted on 14, and convicted in 19. One of the counts on which they were convicted was for selling a diseased bird, leading Hugh Johnson to jokingly call the suit the [...] "sick chicken case".|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s {{to early}} 1980s, PRSA's female {{membership}} base increased, coinciding with more women pursuing {{a career in}} the field. PRSA had its first female President in 1972 and a second female President in 1983. In 1981, 78 percent of PRSA's student society were women, up from 38 percent in 1968. The society grew to 9,000 members by 1981, up from 4,500 members in 1960. In 1977, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said PRSA's code of conduct inhibited <b>fair</b> <b>competition</b> by requiring members not to solicit clients from other members. It issued a consent order that required PRSA to remove content from its code of conduct that contained sexist language, discouraged soliciting clients from other members or encouraged price-fixing activities. PRSA's first definition of public relations was created in 1982 as [...] "Public relations helps an organization and its publics adapt mutually to each other.” In 1986, PRSA's then President Anthony Franco resigned from his post after it was revealed he was accused of insider trading by the Securities Exchange Commission. The PRSA's philanthropy arm, the PRSA Foundation, was founded in 1990.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this ex-post facto study {{determine}} whether or not all students have an equitable chance of winning in science <b>fair</b> <b>competitions.</b> Winners and nonwinners at local, regional, and state levels of 1994 Mississippi science <b>fair</b> <b>competitions</b> were compared for the following variables: project cost. status of participation (voluntary or required and graded or ungraded), computer and/or word processor utilization, location of computei and/or word processor used, utilization of outside help, and parental educational level and occupation. A stratified random sampling technique was utilized to select subjects (N= 372). Data were collected via a questionnaire developed specifically for the study and sent to parents of the sample contestants. Quantitative analysis of the data indicate that all students do not have an equitable chancr! of winning in science <b>fair</b> <b>competitions.</b> At all levels, students using a computer and/or word processor for project preparation {{have a better chance of}} winning and having this equipment in the home is advantageous. At the state level, students receiving outside help are more likely to win. At the regional levels, contestants participating voluntarily, having higher project costs, and college educated parents employed in professional occupations have a better chance of winning.

500|$|Miller {{continued}} {{to represent the}} NFLPA in their early days. Unable to win the owners' attention by forming the union, the NFLPA threatened to bring an antitrust lawsuit against the league. The antitrust laws are meant to protect [...] "free and <b>fair</b> <b>competition</b> in the marketplace" [...] and prohibit practices that may give industries or businesses an unfair advantage over their competitors. That threat became much more credible when the United States Supreme Court ruled in Radovich v. National Football League, , that the NFL did not enjoy the same antitrust immunity that Major League Baseball did, meaning that players like Radovich had been wrongfully barred from finding new employment. Jarett Bell of USA Today noted in 2011, the Radovich ruling [...] "set {{the foundation for a}} series of court battles that have {{continued to}} present times" [...] largely over disagreements in compensation. Rather than face another lawsuit, the owners agreed to a league minimum salary of $5,000, $50 for each exhibition game played, and medical and hospital coverage. Although most of the NFLPA's requests were met, the owners did not enter into a collective bargaining agreement with the association or formally recognize it as the players' exclusive bargaining representative, instead agreeing to change the standard player contract and alter governing documents to reflect the deal.|$|E
500|$|As Christmas approaches, Akeelah {{goes out}} to buy Dr. Larabee a present, but when she meets him, he reveals that he is quitting being her coach because she reminds him of his {{deceased}} daughter Denise. Instead, he gives Akeelah 5,000 flashcards to study. Without her coach, rejected by her best friend Georgia, and feeling the pressure from her neighborhood residents to make them proud, Akeelah loses her motivation. However, Tanya tells {{her that if she}} looked around her, she would realize that she has [...] "50,000 coaches". Akeelah recruits her family members, classmates, teachers, friends, and neighbor Derrick T to prepare in earnest. After reuniting with Dr. Larabee, Akeelah goes to Washington, D.C. with him, along with Tanya, Georgia, Mr. Welch, and Devon, unaware that her coach has paid for four of their tickets. Georgia rekindles her friendship with Akeelah after she invites her. During the competition, Akeelah becomes a crowd favorite. After all the other competitors are eliminated, only Dylan and Akeelah remain. The two finalists are allowed a break, during which Akeelah overhears Dylan's father harshly pressuring him to win. Akeelah attempts to intentionally lose by deliberately misspelling [...] "xanthosis". Dylan, knowing that Akeelah knows this word, intentionally misspells it as well. Dylan tells Akeelah that he wants a <b>fair</b> <b>competition,</b> rejecting his father's obsession to win. The two then proceed to spell every word listed by the judges in the hopes of winning the championship together, with Dylan earning a share of it by correctly spelling [...] "logorrhea", much to his father's delight. Akeelah spells the last word on the list, [...] "pulchritude", and the two are declared co-champions amidst a cheering crowd.|$|E
