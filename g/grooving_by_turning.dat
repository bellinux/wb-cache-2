50|$|Comatulids are {{suspension}} feeders. The {{arms are}} extended {{and held in}} such a position as to maximise the feeding surface {{with regard to the}} current. At each junction of the ossicles in the pinnules there are a group of three suckerless tube feet. The longest of these searches for plankton in the surrounding water. When a particle is found, it is gathered in and thrust into the ambulacral <b>groove</b> <b>by</b> all three tube feet. Here it is formed into a bolus with mucus and moved down to the mouth by the actions of the cilia, being retained in the <b>groove</b> <b>by</b> the lappets.|$|R

50|$|In 1948 Merton made an {{important}} basic {{advance in the}} art of ruling diffraction gratings. Since 1880 these had been ruled <b>groove</b> <b>by</b> <b>groove</b> <b>by</b> the method used by Rowlands. In place of this, Merton ruled a very fine helix continuously on a steel cylinder which he then opened out upon a plane gelatine-coated surface by his copying method. No lathe could, however, rule a helix free from errors of pitch and these Merton eliminated by an ingenious device. It consisted of a ‘chasing lathe’ by which he cut a secondary helix on the same cylinder with a tool mounted on a ‘Merton nut’ lined with strips of cork pressed upon the primary lathe-cut helix. Periodic errors were thus averaged and eliminated by the elasticity of the cork.|$|R

50|$|With {{the earlier}} Armstrong (RBL or rifled breech loading) guns the {{projectiles}} were coated with lead (the late Lord Armstrong's system), the lead being forced through the rifling <b>grooves</b> <b>by</b> {{the pressure of}} the exploded powder gas.

40|$|Using fresh cadaveric arms, extraneural {{pressures}} {{were recorded}} {{along the path}} of the ulnar nerve at he elbow using a f ine silastic cannula. Significant pressure increases occurred when the elbow was flexed beyond a right angle, and concomitant shoulder abduction further raised the pressures recorded at the cubital tunnel and postcondylar groove. Surgical release o f the cubital tunnel decreased pressures in the post-condylar <b>groove</b> <b>by</b> approximately 50 per cent when the elbow was fully flexed, whereas clamping the flexor carpi aponeurotic arch significantly increased extraneural pressures in the <b>groove,</b> presumablyi <b>by</b> preventing accommodative changes in neural relationshitJs...|$|R

50|$|Adult worms of all Oesophagostomum spp. {{exhibit a}} cephalic <b>groove</b> <b>by</b> its {{proximal}} gut {{as well as}} a visible secretory pore, or stomum, at the same level of the oesophagus19.

Their developed buccal capsule and club-shaped oesophagus are useful for distinguishing Oesophagostomum spp. from hookworms.|$|R
50|$|Stereo vinyl records encode {{both the}} left and right stereo {{channels}} in a single <b>groove.</b> <b>By</b> making the <b>groove</b> a 90-degree cut into the vinyl, variation in one wall was independent of variations in the other wall.

50|$|The {{introduction}} of electronic amplification allowed these {{issues to be}} addressed. Records are made with boosted high frequencies and reduced low frequencies, which allow for different ranges of sound to be produced.. This reduces the effect of background noise, including clicks or pops, and also conserves the amount of physical space needed for each <b>groove,</b> <b>by</b> reducing {{the size of the}} low-frequency undulations.|$|R
