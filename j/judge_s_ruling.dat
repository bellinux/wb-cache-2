40|$|In United States u. Ruiz, the Ninth Circuit {{ruled that}} such waivers are unconstitutional, violating the {{principle}} that defendants in criminal cases must knowingly and voluntarily plead guilty for the plea to be constitutionally valid. The {{purpose of this article}} is to discuss the law leading up to the Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ruling</b> in Ruiz, to examine the court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ruling</b> itself, and to analyze the impact this decision could have on plea bargaining, an integral part of the criminal justice system. In Part II, this Note discusses Ruiz 2 ̆ 7 s facts and procedural history. Part III, section A outlines the prosecution 2 ̆ 7 s duty to disclose exculpatory and impeachment evidence as set forth by the United States Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>rulings</b> in Brady v.
