2500|$|At dawn, the 6th Company of RIR 122 {{arrived in}} Quadrangle Support, after a fraught night march. Leutnant Köstlin had {{received}} the order in the afternoon of 9 July and took the company back to Martinpuich for supplies and ammunition but the <b>field</b> <b>kitchen</b> draught horse bolted from a shell with the <b>field</b> <b>kitchen.</b> Ammunition took until after midnight to issue and then the company moved forward, with two machine-guns. Two guides had been sent back from the III Battalion {{but it was so}} dark that Köstlin went cross-country on a compass bearing. The column lost cohesion in the dark between Martinpuich and Bazentin {{because of the number of}} shell-holes and trenches to traverse and the halts to form up took too much time. Köstlin formed the company into columns of sections after passing over the second position and the advance quickened. The ground was under shellfire and casualties began to increase. Köstlin decided to avoid Mametz Wood and move in the open between the wood and Comtalmaison on the line of the Grossherzogsgraben (Pearl Alley) to Quadrangle Trench and then to the wood from Quadrangle Support. As they crossed the Contalmaison–Bazentin road at [...] as dawn was breaking, Köstlin sent the guides forward who took twenty minutes to get back and report that the trench was straight ahead. As the company advanced, a machine-gun opened fire from the right and caused much confusion. Köstlin shouted [...] "Double march, into the trench in front" [...] but it was another [...] further on and only thirty men followed him, the rest retreating in confusion to the second position or taking cover.|$|E

60|$|This proved correct enough, {{for when}} the men came in with the thrasher and the {{homestead}} vibrated to its hum, others whose harvests were garnered came too, out of good-will, and Harry was cooking and baking all day long.
