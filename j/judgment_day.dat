60|$|As if to crown that <b>judgment,</b> the <b>day</b> {{was dark}} and lowering, with showers of rain from time to time. And when we spoke,--Polly Ann and I,--it was in whispers. The trace was very narrow, with Daniel Boone's blazes, two years old, upon the trees; but the way was not over steep. Cumberland Mountain was as silent and deserted as when the first man had known it.|$|R

For this he has been condemned to death by <b>judgment</b> this <b>day</b> of the Field Court Martial of the Naval Corps, and has been executed.

5000|$|Grosso {{had a brief}} {{foray into}} {{politics}} in the late 1970s. It was rumored Grosso backed {{the same man who}} was able to sentence him to jail earlier. Even though former PA state governor and US attorney general Dick Thornburgh denied Grosso's support many said Grosso spoke of spending over a million dollars on his campaign against former Pittsburgh Mayor Pete Flaherty. Grosso was said to have hired flying billboards to circle over Friday night football games saying [...] "Don't elect a crook for governor Pennsylvania". The signs were thought to be referring to Pete Flaherty. While trying to gain his freedom in the early 1990s, Grosso became disappointed in Thornburgh with his lack of effort in aiding him in his release from jail. Some family member's felt Grosso was troubled by his treatment of Flaherty saying {{it was one of the}} only regrets of his life. In the end, Grosso always felt Flaherty was a [...] "good Man" [...] and spoke of his lapse in <b>judgment</b> <b>days</b> before his death. Grosso was never able to apologize to Flaherty before his passing. Grosso's involvement in the campaign probably cost Flaherty the Governorship. Time magazine reported the alleged antics of Grosso during the year of Flaherty's run.|$|R
5|$|John Cena and The Great Khali also {{continued}} to feud over the WWE Championship. Following the controversial ending to their match at <b>Judgment</b> <b>Day,</b> where Cena forced Khali to submit while his foot was underneath the bottom rope, meaning Cena should have released the hold, Khali challenged Cena to a Falls Count Anywhere match for One Night Stand. Cena accepted, and Khali attacked him, performing a Chokebomb. At One Night Stand, Cena retained his title by pinning Khali after performing an FU off a crane.|$|E
5|$|<b>Judgment</b> <b>Day</b> {{provided}} {{the culmination of}} various scripted plots and storylines. A month before the event, several professional wrestling matches and scripted plots were played out on WWE programming (Raw, Friday Night SmackDown!, and ECW on Sci Fi) to create feuds between various wrestlers, casting them as villains and heroes. Raw, SmackDown, and ECW were also the names of WWE's televised brands– a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a specific program, thus each brand promoted distinct matches.|$|E
5|$|One more rivalry {{from the}} Raw brand was between John Cena and JBL. In the Fatal Four-Way Elimination match at Backlash, Cena {{eliminated}} JBL by making him {{submit to the}} STFU, a move in which the wrestler wraps his arm {{around the neck of}} the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent. On the April 28 episode of Raw, JBL challenged Cena to a singles match at <b>Judgment</b> <b>Day,</b> which was made official on WWE's website.|$|E
