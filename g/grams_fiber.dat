The most suitable experimental conditions for the selective TEMPO-mediated oxidation were determined by changing oxidation conditions: concentration of sodium hypochlorite and duration of sorption.

SEM microphotographs of the modified hemp fibers with incorporated silver showed uniformly distributed silver particles on the surface of fibers, with isometric shapes and sizes from 10 to 100 nm, despite the fact that silver was sorbed from ionic solution. The antibacterial activity of the TEMPO-oxidized hemp fibers with silver particles was confirmed in vitro against two strains: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and the antifungal activity against fungi Candida albicans (ATCC 24433).

It was used to increase the fiber content of the cake to at least 2. 5 <b>grams</b> of <b>fiber</b> per serving, making a good source of fiber. This was accomplished in two ways: 1) adding 40 grams of GBF to a control chocolate cake mix (A), and 2) replacing 40 grams of the cake mix with the 40 grams of GBF (R). The unaltered commercial cake mix was used as the control (C). Objective testing using the TA. TX 2 Texture Analyzer determined compression and penetration forces. These tests indicated that A required significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) higher forces with all four probes used, while R had a higher compression and penetration force (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) with two out of the four probes. Untrained subjects (n= 27 on day 1 and n= 35 on day 2) participated in sensory testing using 9 -point intensity or hedonic scales. Based on these tests, A was significantly less sweet than C and was significantly less moist than both C and R. No significant sensory differences were determined between R and C. Some objective and subjective differences between the cakes were established but most importantly, the acceptability rating was not significantly different. Overall, this study demonstrates two acceptable methods to increase the fiber intake of consumers using GBF as a fiber enhancer...|$|R

40|$|Background: Arterial pulse pressure, the {{difference}} between systolic and diastolic blood pressure, {{has been used as}} an indicator (surrogate measure) of arterial stiffness. High arterial pulse pressure (3 ̆e 40) has been associated with increased cardiovascular disease and mortality. Several clinical trials have reported that the proportion of calories from carbohydrate has an effect on blood pressure. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} assess arterial pulse pressure and its association with carbohydrate quantity and quality (glycemic load) with diabetes status for a Cuban American population. Methods: A single point analysis included 367 participants. There was complete data for 365 (190 with and 175 without type 2 diabetes). The study was conducted in the investigator’s laboratory located in Miami, Florida. Demographic, dietary, anthropometric and laboratory data were collected. Arterial pulse pressure was calculated by the formula systolic minus the diastolic blood pressure. Glycemic load, fructose, sucrose, percent of average daily calories from carbohydrate, fat and protein, <b>grams</b> of <b>fiber</b> and micronutrient intakes were calculated from a validated food frequency questionnaire.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} guar gum supplementation in the metabolic control and body mass index (BMI) of type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: A total of 17 (12 women and 5 men) participants ingested 10 <b>grams</b> of <b>fiber</b> supplement daily for three months. Changes in BMI and the biochemical parameters (fasting glycemia, glycosilated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c), total plasma cholesterol and triglycerides) were evaluated {{at the beginning and}} the end of the study. RESULTS: No changes in mean BMI (p= 0. 770), mean fasting glycemia (p= 0. 09) or triglyceride levels were observed. However, significant increases in HbA 1 c levels were observed (p< 0. 001) following the ingestion of guar gum supplements. Posterior analysis indicated that the five participants that had the highest mean fasting blood glucose and HbA 1 c levels, showed a significant reduction in their fasting glycemic levels (p= 0. 03) at the end of the study. A significant (p< 0. 001) reduction in total cholesterol levels was observed after three months of guar gum supplementation. CONCLUSION: Guar gum supplementation (10 g/day) in the diet of overweight type 2 diabetics, resulting in total fiber ingestion close to 20 g per day, did not lead to a spontaneous reduction in body weight. The effect of guar gum on the glycidic metabolic control was inconclusive, but it was shown to be an effective dietetic strategy to reduce blood cholesterol levels...|$|R
40|$|Background—Congestive {{heart failure}} (CHF) induces {{abnormalities}} in skeletal muscle that {{are thought to}} in part explain exercise intolerance. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine whether these changes actually result in contractile or metabolic functional alterations and whether they are muscle type specific. Methods and Results—With a rat model of CHF (induced by aortic banding), we studied mitochondrial function, mechanical properties, and creatine kinase (CK) compartmentation in situ in permeabilized fibers from soleus (SOL), an oxidative slow-twitch muscle, and white gastrocnemius (GAS), a glycolytic fast-twitch muscle. Animals were studied 7 months after surgery, and CHF was documented on the basis of anatomic data. Alterations in skeletal muscle phenotype were documented with an increased proportion of fast-type fiber and fast myosin heavy chain, decreased capillary-to-fiber ratio, and decreased citrate synthase activity. Despite a slow-to-fast phenotype transition in SOL, no change was observed in contractile capacity or calcium sensitivity. However, muscles from CHF rats exhibited a dramatic decrease in oxidative capacities (oxygen consumption per <b>gram</b> of <b>fiber</b> dry weight) of 35 % for SOL and 45 % for GAS (P, 0. 001). Moreover, the regulation of respiration with ADP and mitochondrial CK and adenylate kinase was impaired in CHF SOL. Mitochondrial CK activity and content (Western blots) were dramatically decreased in both muscles. Conclusions—CHF results in alterations in both mitochondrial function and phosphotransfer systems but unchanged myofibrillar function in skeletal muscles, which suggests a myopathy of metabolic origin in CHF.
