5000|$|Roller dams of {{any type}} pose an extreme {{drowning}} hazard. Any person going {{over the top of}} the dam will be caught in the rolling action at its base and may not be ejected from the cycle for days or possibly weeks.

50|$|Mount Lavinia Beach is Sri Lanka's main sea-bathing spot. Here, {{depending}} on season, the waves can be swimmable and it's host to some amazing sunsets. The waters is swimmable only {{at certain times}} of the year and can be very rough, with undertow. From there you can cross the rail-tracks, past the three legged dog and Golden Mile restaurant, and you're on the beach. People sell swimsuits, <b>inflatable</b> <b>balls,</b> sour mango, and manioca chips if you need.

The company's vast diversified output proved difficult to efficiently manage, and after suffering a series of losses, the company began to sell off most of its manufacturing operations.|$|E
5000|$|The group's inventions {{include the}} MidiBall, a device for {{interactive}} musical participation.

25|$|A beach <b>ball</b> is an <b>inflatable</b> <b>ball</b> for {{beach and}} water games. Their large size and light weight take {{little effort to}} propel; they travel very slowly and {{generally}} must be caught with two hands, making them ideal for lazy games and for children. Their lightness and size make them difficult to use in even moderate wind. The beach ball was invented in California by Jonathon DeLonge in 1938.|$|R
50|$|For the DVD {{recording}} {{nights at}} Manchester Apollo on 3 and 4 December, The Moon's reworking of the Jay-Z track, 99 Problems, was removed due to copyright clearance - {{but it has}} been performed on almost every other night of the tour (apart from one of the early Glasgow shows where the Moon did not appear due to technical issues), including the other shows that week. Eleanor also switched from throwing her usual ball-pit style balls into the audience during the bingo section, instead throwing and kicking giant, numbered, <b>inflatable</b> <b>balls</b> into the crowds - on the DVD filming nights, these were also signed by the cast.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1860s, {{manufactured}} <b>inflatable</b> <b>balls</b> {{were introduced}} through the innovations of shoemaker Richard Lindon. These {{were much more}} regular in shape than the handmade balls of earlier times, making kicking and carrying easier. These early footballs were plum-shaped.Some teams used to have white footballs for purposes of night practice. Georgia Tech back Judy Harlan once spoke of Joe Guyon, a full blooded Indian, and his antics: [...] "Once in a while the Indian would come out in Joe, such as the nights Heisman gave us a white football and had us working out under the lights. That's when Guyon would give out the blood curdling war whoops." ...|$|E
5000|$|FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar was the 2004 {{game for}} the FIRST Robotics Competition. The game {{included}} elements from previous years' games, including mobile goals, [...] "capping" [...] goals with large <b>inflatable</b> <b>balls,</b> and others. In Raising the Bar, teams could score by having their human player score purple balls {{in any of the}} goals, capping the goals with a multiplier ball, or hanging their robot suspended from the 10 ft high 'chin up bar'. In the qualifying matches, Teams competed in 2-member randomly generated alliances. In the elimination rounds, 3-member alliances competed against each other with one team sitting out each match. The alliance that won two matches advanced in the tournament.|$|E

50|$|In 1952 the United States {{military}} {{developed a}} portable solar still for pilots stranded on the ocean, which comprises an <b>inflatable</b> 24-inch plastic <b>ball</b> that floats on the ocean, with a flexible tube coming out the side. A separate plastic bag hangs from attachment {{points on the}} outer bag. Seawater is poured into the inner bag from {{an opening in the}} ball's neck. Fresh water is taken out by the pilot using the side tube that leads to bottom of the <b>inflatable</b> <b>ball.</b> It was stated in magazine articles that on a good day 2.5 US quarts (2.4 l) of fresh water could be produced. On an overcast day, 1.5 US quarts (1.4 l) was produced. Similar sea water stills are included in some life raft survival kits, though manual reverse osmosis desalinators have mostly replaced them.|$|R
50|$|Used {{primarily}} by Doc Johnson, Vac-u-lock dildos have a rippled hollow in their base, which fits onto a matching {{plug on the}} harness or other toy. Powdered lubricant is used on the plug to facilitate removal. The advantage of this design is the dildo is firmly attached and can not easily rotate, and does not tend to flop downwards or slip like ring harnesses, as well as there being {{a wide variety of}} other devices the dildos can be attached to, such as handles and <b>inflatable</b> <b>balls.</b> The disadvantage is the relatively low availability and high cost of compatible attachments. A number of brands have non-compatible clones of the vac-u-lock system, but dildos and accessories for them are virtually unavailable.|$|E
5000|$|The Fun House, {{described}} as [...] "a giant, anthropomorphic bounce house {{intended to help}} unleash the visitors‚Äô inner brats and in doing so, {{take advantage of the}} healing power of fun," [...] was originally commissioned by 944 magazine and the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas in 2008.

In December 1965 Karl Kr√∏yer, a Dane, lifted the sunken freight vessel Al Kuwait in the Kuwait Harbor by filling the hull with 27 million tiny <b>inflatable</b> <b>balls</b> of polystyrene.Although the suggestion is often made, Kr√∏yer denies having been inspired by this Barks story. Some sources claim Kr√∏yer was denied a Dutch patent registration (application number NL 6514306) for his invention {{on the grounds that}} the Barks story was a prior publication of the invention. However no definite proof of this story is available. Kr√∏yer later successfully raised another ship off Greenland using the same method, and several other sunken vessels worldwide have since been raised by modified versions of this concept. The television show MythBusters also tested this method and was able to raise a small boat.|$|E

50|$|Recaptured Nature {{is one of}} Orozco's {{earliest}} sculptural {{works and}} is constructed entirely from the vulcanized rubber made to create the inner tubes of truck tires. Orozco cut the rubber down the middle, then opened it up, cut two circular lid shapes from another inner tube, and welded them together at a tire shop. This resulted in an <b>inflatable</b> <b>ball.</b> Orozco says the work is an ‚Äúexercise in topology,‚Äù an area of mathematics concerned with the study of continuity and connectivity. Recaptured Nature plays {{with the idea that}} everything can become everything else. This piece informed future works like Elevator in which the artist reconstructed an elevator to be exactly his height.|$|R
5000|$|Harnesses are {{available}} to attach dildos to just about any household object, allowing for many creative uses. A dildo could be attached to a chair, bed, or any other item of furniture, and penetrate someone during other activities, {{with or without a}} partner. Another item, while not technically a harness, but worth mentioning, is an inflatable ball, usually 9 to 18 inches (250 to 500 mm) diameter, made of sturdy rubber designed to support the weight of one or two people, with an attachment for a dildo on it. This allows many unique positions, such as double penetration for a woman by lying face down on the ball for vaginal penetration while her partner penetrates her anally doggy style, which is much more effective than a solid object due to the [...] "bounce" [...] of the ball. These <b>inflatable</b> <b>balls</b> are also quite popular for solo use.|$|E

Their outfits consist of short-sleeve, button up, knee-length dresses with white, puffed-out collars and sleeves, white boots with fringes matching the color of their dresses, and headwear that resembles characters from the movie; Rena stands in the middle and wears a yellow dress and a hat shaped like Mametchi's head, Miki stands to her left while wearing a green dress and a hat shaped like Kuchipatchi's head, and Kei stands to Rena's right while wearing an orange dress and a hat shaped like Memetchi's body.Additionally, a flash video of Mametchi dancing to [...] "Rena's Version" [...] of the song was released on the official site and on the press-release version of the CD.|$|E
5000|$|The Boston Game {{is thought}} to be the origin of American football, played by New England prep schools. In 1855, {{manufactured}} <b>inflatable</b> <b>balls</b> were introduced. These were much more regular in shape than the handmade balls of earlier times, making kicking and carrying more skillful. Two competing versions had evolved during this time; the [...] "kicking game" [...] which resembled soccer and the [...] "running" [...] or [...] "carrying game" [...] which resembled rugby union. hybrid of the two, known as the [...] "Boston game", was played by a group known as the Oneida Football Club. The club, considered by some historians as the first formal football club in the United States, was formed in 1861 by schoolboys who played the [...] "Boston game" [...] on Boston Common. They played mostly among themselves early on; though they organized a team of non-members to play a game in November, 1863, which the Oneidas won easily. The game caught the attention of the press, and the [...] "Boston game" [...] continued to grow throughout the 1860s.|$|E

50|$|In this Detour, {{teams had}} to choose between Wheels and Peels. In Wheels, teams had to push a large water {{tricycle}} into the water, and then pedal it out to a large <b>inflatable</b> <b>ball.</b> They would then ride back to shore on a banana boat with their ball and, once on shore, could open the ball to find their next clue. In Peels, teams had to ride a Segway across a marked course to a dig site on the beach. They would then have to dig up six different kinds of fruits and exchange them for their next clue. In the Roadblock, one team member had to eat a large serving of blood clams and then drink three glasses of Baijiu.|$|R
