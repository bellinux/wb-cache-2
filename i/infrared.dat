5|$|<b>Infrared</b> {{astronomy}} {{is founded}} on the detection and analysis of <b>infrared</b> radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The <b>infrared</b> spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of <b>infrared</b> can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field <b>Infrared</b> Survey Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and their host star clusters.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of <b>infrared</b> wavelengths close to visible light, such radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself produces significant <b>infrared</b> emission. Consequently, <b>infrared</b> observatories have to be located in high, dry places on Earth or in space. Some molecules radiate strongly in the <b>infrared.</b> This allows {{the study of the}} chemistry of space; more specifically it can detect water in comets.|$|E
5|$|All {{images from}} Hubble are {{monochromatic}} grayscale, in which its cameras incorporate {{a variety of}} filters each passing specific wavelengths of light. Color images are created by combining separate monochrome images taken through different filters. This process can also create false-color versions of images including <b>infrared</b> and ultraviolet channels, where <b>infrared</b> is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet is rendered as a deep blue.|$|E
5|$|Based on an {{observed}} excess {{emission of}} <b>infrared</b> radiation, Vega {{appears to have}} a circumstellar disk of dust. This dust {{is likely to be the}} result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk, which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System. Stars which display an <b>infrared</b> excess due to dust emission are termed Vega-like stars.|$|E
5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in the <b>infrared</b> wavelengths, it is {{an important}} <b>infrared</b> optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in <b>infrared</b> spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive <b>infrared</b> detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium is a {{component}} of some compound semiconductors, such as cadmium sulfide, cadmium selenide, and cadmium telluride, used for light detection and solar cells. HgCdTe is sensitive to <b>infrared</b> light {{and can be used}} as an <b>infrared</b> detector, motion detector, or switch in remote control devices.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{ytterbium}} {{is being}} investigated as a possible replacement for magnesium in high density pyrotechnic payloads for kinematic <b>infrared</b> decoy flares. As ytterbium(III) oxide has a significantly higher emissivity in the <b>infrared</b> range than magnesium oxide, a higher radiant intensity is obtained with ytterbium-based payloads in comparison to those commonly based on magnesium/Teflon/Viton (MTV).|$|E
5|$|Gallium {{arsenide}} {{is used in}} {{a variety}} of optoelectronic <b>infrared</b> devices. Aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) is used in high-power <b>infrared</b> laser diodes. The semiconductors gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride are used in blue and violet optoelectronic devices, mostly laser diodes and light-emitting diodes. For example, gallium nitride 405nm diode lasers are used as a violet light source for higher-density Blu-ray Disc compact data disc drives.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the design}} was further {{modified}} to the Do 17 Z-10 Kauz II, the solid nose now containing an infra-red searchlight for the Spanner Anlage <b>infrared</b> detection system. The <b>infrared</b> lamp {{in the nose}} was used to illuminate the target while the display unit in the windshield made the reflection visible to the target. The Z-10 was armed with four 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine guns grouped above the IR light and two 20mm MG FF in the lower nose. The crew could reload the 20mm cannons' drum magazines internally. The Z-10 contained an IR searchlight (Spanner-Anlage) for the Spanner <b>infrared</b> detection system. A single Kauz II was equipped with and tested the Lichtenstein radar.|$|E
5|$|Luminous <b>infrared</b> galaxies or LIRGs are galaxies with luminosities, the {{measurement}} of brightness, above 1011 L☉. LIRGs are more abundant than starburst galaxies, Seyfert galaxies and quasi-stellar objects at comparable total luminosity. <b>Infrared</b> galaxies emit more energy in the <b>infrared</b> than at all other wavelengths combined. A LIRG's luminosity is 100 billion times that of our Sun.|$|E
5|$|Most {{variants}} of the AW101 {{are equipped with}} self-defence systems, such as chaff and flare dispensers, directed <b>infrared</b> countermeasures (<b>infrared</b> jammers), ESM (electronic support measures {{in the form of}} RF heads), and a laser detection and warning system. British Merlins have been outfitted with protective armour against small-arms fire. A chin-mounted forward looking <b>infrared</b> (FLIR) imaging sensor has been fitted to some variants.|$|E
5|$|Single {{crystals}} of {{the salt}} are transparent into the deep <b>infrared.</b> For this reason it is sometimes used as the windows of cells used for <b>infrared</b> spectroscopy.|$|E
5|$|Stratospheric Observatory for <b>Infrared</b> Astronomy (SOFIA) – A former Pan Am Boeing 747SP {{modified}} {{to carry a}} large infrared-sensitive telescope, in a joint venture of NASA and DLR. High altitudes are needed for <b>infrared</b> astronomy, in order to rise above infrared-absorbing water vapor in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 was {{designed}} to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. Measures to reduce radar cross-section include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets that prevent line-of-sight of the engine faces from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio emissions, <b>infrared</b> signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The aircraft's flat thrust-vectoring nozzle reduces <b>infrared</b> emissions to mitigate the threat of <b>infrared</b> homing ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Additional measures to reduce the <b>infrared</b> signature include special paint and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.|$|E
5|$|The dust {{present in}} the {{interstellar}} medium is opaque to visual light. It is more transparent to far-infrared, {{which can be used}} to observe the interior regions of giant molecular clouds and galactic cores in great detail. <b>Infrared</b> is also used to observe distant, red-shifted galaxies that were formed much earlier {{in the history of the}} Universe. Water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb a number of useful portions of the <b>infrared</b> spectrum, so high-altitude or space-based telescopes are used for <b>infrared</b> astronomy.|$|E
5|$|The field {{selected}} for the observations needed to fulfill several criteria. It {{had to be at}} a high galactic latitude, because dust and obscuring matter in the plane of the Milky Way's disc prevents observations of distant galaxies at low galactic latitudes. The target field had to avoid known bright sources of visible light (such as foreground stars), and <b>infrared,</b> ultraviolet and X-ray emissions, to facilitate later studies at many wavelengths of the objects in the deep field, and also needed to be in a region with a low background <b>infrared</b> 'cirrus', the diffuse, wispy <b>infrared</b> emission believed to be caused by warm dust grains in cool clouds of hydrogen gas (H I regions).|$|E
5|$|The first <b>infrared</b> {{observations}} {{were published in}} 1998, in which both near and far <b>infrared</b> spectroscopy data was presented. The collected data showed Sakurai's Object's steep brightening in 1996, followed by {{a sharp decline in}} 1999 as expected. It was later found that the Star's steep decline in light was due to the circumstellar dust located around the star, which was present at a temperature of ~680 K. Further <b>infrared</b> data recorded by the United Kingdom <b>Infrared</b> Telescope was published in 2000, in which findings of the changing absorption lines were discussed.|$|E
5|$|Vehicle {{camouflage}} techniques {{begin with}} paint, which offers at best only limited effectiveness. Other methods for stationary land vehicles include covering with improvised {{materials such as}} blankets and vegetation, and erecting nets, screens and soft covers which may suitably reflect, scatter or absorb near <b>infrared</b> and radar waves. Some military textiles and vehicle camouflage paints also reflect <b>infrared</b> to help provide concealment from night vision devices.|$|E
5|$|Very-high {{redshift}} objects (Lyman-break galaxies) {{cannot be}} seen in visible light and generally are detected in <b>infrared</b> or submillimetre wavelength surveys of the HDF instead. Observations with the <b>Infrared</b> Space Observatory (ISO) indicated <b>infrared</b> emission from 13 galaxies visible in the optical images, attributed to large quantities of dust associated with intense star formation. <b>Infrared</b> observations have also been made with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Submillimeter observations of the field have been made with SCUBA on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, initially detecting 5 sources, although with very low resolution. Observations have also been made with the Subaru telescope in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Water megamasers {{were the}} first type of megamaser discovered. The first water megamaser was found in 1979 in NGC 4945, a galaxy in the nearby Centaurus A/M83 Group. The first {{hydroxyl}} megamaser was found in 1982 in Arp 220, which is the nearest ultraluminous <b>infrared</b> galaxy to the Milky Way. All subsequent OH megamasers that have been discovered are also in luminous <b>infrared</b> galaxies, {{and there are a}} small number of OH kilomasers hosted in galaxies with lower <b>infrared</b> luminosities. Most luminous <b>infrared</b> galaxies have recently merged or interacted with another galaxy, and are undergoing a burst of star formation. Many of the characteristics of the emission in hydroxyl megamasers are distinct from that of hydroxyl masers within the Milky Way, including the amplification of background radiation and the ratio of hydroxyl lines at different frequencies. The population inversion in hydroxyl molecules is produced by far <b>infrared</b> radiation that results from absorption and re-emission of light from forming stars by surrounding interstellar dust. Zeeman splitting of hydroxyl megamaser lines may be used to measure magnetic fields in the masing regions, and this application represents the first detection of Zeeman splitting in a galaxy other than the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{hypothesis}} {{put forth}} by Richard Lindzen is the iris hypothesis in which an increase in tropical sea surface temperatures results in less cirrus clouds and thus more <b>infrared</b> radiation emitted to space.|$|E
5|$|Active {{camouflage}} for vehicles, using heated or cooled Peltier {{plates to}} match the <b>infrared</b> background, has been prototyped in industry but {{has not yet been}} put into production.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a distant}} planet such as Planet Nine would reflect little light, {{it would still}} be {{radiating}} the heat from its formation as it cools due to its large mass. At its estimated temperature of 47 K, the peak of its emissions would be at <b>infrared</b> wavelengths. This radiation signature could be detected by Earth-based <b>infrared</b> telescopes, such as ALMA, and a search could be conducted by cosmic microwave background experiments operating at mm wavelengths. Additionally, Jim Green of NASA is optimistic that it could be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, that is expected to be launched in 2019.|$|E
5|$|Another {{piece of}} claimed {{evidence}} drawn from Google Sky is the carbon star CW Leonis, {{which is the}} brightest object in the 10 μm <b>infrared</b> sky and is frequently claimed to be Nibiru.|$|E
5|$|As of {{the year}} 2000, about 15% of United States {{consumption}} of germanium was used for <b>infrared</b> optics technology and 50% for fiber-optics. Over the past 20 years, <b>infrared</b> use has consistently decreased; fiber optic demand, however, is slowly increasing. In America, 30–50% of current fiber optic lines are unused dark fiber, sparking discussion of over-production and a future reduction in demand. Worldwide, demand is increasing dramatically as countries such as China are installing fiber optic telecommunication lines throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|Barium {{fluoride}} is {{used for}} optics in <b>infrared</b> applications because of its wide transparency range of 0.15–12micrometers.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{telluride}} is a semiconductor and {{an excellent}} thermoelectric material. Bi2Te3 diodes are used in mobile refrigerators, CPU coolers, and as detectors in <b>infrared</b> spectrophotometers.|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in December 2000, the star's diameter was measured with the <b>Infrared</b> Spatial Interferometer (ISI) at mid-infrared wavelengths producing a limb-darkened estimate of 55.2±0.5milliarcseconds (mas)—a figure entirely consistent with Michelson's findings eighty years earlier. At the time of its publication, the estimated parallax from the Hipparcos mission was 7.63 ± 1.64mas, yielding an estimated radius for Betelgeuse of 3.6AU. However, an <b>infrared</b> interferometric {{study published}} in 2009 announced that the star had shrunk by 15% since 1993 at an increasing rate without a significant diminution in magnitude. Subsequent observations suggest that the apparent contraction may be due to shell activity in the star's extended atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|<b>Infrared</b> {{emission}} {{also reveals}} {{the presence of}} un-ionised material such as molecular hydrogen (H2) and argon. In many planetary nebulae, molecular emission is greatest at larger distances from the star, where more material is un-ionised, but molecular hydrogen emission in NGC 6543 seems to be bright at the inner edge of its outer halo. This {{may be due to}} shock waves exciting the H2 as ejecta moving at different speeds collide. The overall appearance of the Cat's Eye Nebula in <b>infrared</b> (wavelengths 2–8μm) is similar in visible light.|$|E
5|$|<b>Infrared</b> {{light is}} of lower energy than visible light, hence is emitted by cooler objects. As such, the {{following}} {{can be viewed}} in the infrared: cool stars (including brown dwarves), nebulae, and redshifted galaxies.|$|E
5|$|<b>Infrared</b> {{sensitive}} {{semiconductor material}} is formed by alloying tellurium with cadmium and mercury to form mercury cadmium telluride.|$|E
5|$|Inspection under <b>infrared</b> has {{revealed}} that the panels were heavily reworked during a number of revisions. The legs of the central figure are surrounded by small magenta horseshoe shapes, which <b>infrared</b> shows to have been first drafted as flowers. The area below the head is thickly coated with white and orange paint, while the inspection exposes a series of underlying curved brushstrokes used to compose a landscape, and a small distant reclining figure. When the canvas is unframed, a number of measuring marks are visible on the outer margin of board, indicating that the composition was carefully conceived.|$|E
5|$|Launched in 1983, {{the space}} {{telescope}} IRAS detected <b>infrared</b> emissions from stars near to the Sun, including an excess <b>infrared</b> emission from Epsilon Eridani. The observations indicated a disk of fine-grained cosmic dust was orbiting the star; this debris disk has since been extensively studied. Evidence for a planetary system was discovered in 1998 by the observation of asymmetries in this dust ring. The clumping in the dust distribution {{could be explained by}} gravitational interactions with a planet orbiting just inside the dust ring.|$|E
5|$|Long-slit Intermediate Resolution <b>Infrared</b> Spectrograph – {{near-infrared}} imager/spectrograph, with imaging over a 4' field, spectral resolutions R = 700-2500, spectropolarimetry, {{and long}} slit and multi-object slit-masks. Mounted at Cassegrain focus.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{from the}} United Kingdom <b>Infrared</b> Telescope (UKIRT) in 1999 {{revealed}} that the star is in a RCB-like phase {{with the release of}} dust and huge loss of mass.|$|E
5|$|On August 28, after {{emergency}} approvals, an MQ-1 Predator {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} {{flew over}} the area, providing <b>infrared</b> video of lurking fires.|$|E
