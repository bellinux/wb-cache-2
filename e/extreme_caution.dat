5|$|Nonbenzodiazepines are {{contraindicated}} during benzodiazepine withdrawal as {{they are}} cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence. Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another. During withdrawal, fluoroquinolone-based antibiotics are best avoided if possible; they displace benzodiazepines from their binding site and reduce GABA function and, thus, may aggravate withdrawal symptoms. Antipsychotics are not recommended for benzodiazepine withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used <b>extreme</b> <b>caution</b> is required.|$|E

Gale warnings were later issued for islands off northern Venezuela and from Saint Vincent northward to Martinique. Advisories on Flora emphasized {{the danger of}} the hurricane and advised preparations to be rushed to completion. The advisories also recommended small craft throughout the Windward Islands to remain at harbor and for shipping {{in the path of the}} hurricane to advise <b>extreme</b> <b>caution.</b> People in low-lying areas and near beaches were advised to evacuate to higher grounds, as well. Lead time was short, especially in Tobago which received news of the approaching hurricane just two hours before it struck.|$|E
5|$|While moving erratically off {{the east}} coast of Florida, Tropical Storm Edouard {{produced}} rough surf conditions and rip currents along many beaches. Beachgoers and visitors were advised to exercise <b>extreme</b> <b>caution.</b> The storm produced water levels about 6inches above normal near Cape Canaveral, though elsewhere wave action and storm tides were not significant. Despite being a tropical storm at landfall, sustained tropical storm force winds were not observed. A rainband ahead of the storm produced a 39mph (63km/h) wind gust at Patrick Air Force Base, and a station in St. Augustine recorded a wind gust of 38mph (61km/h). Sustained winds peaked at 31mph (50km/h) at Patrick Air Force Base. Edouard dropped light to moderate rainfall in eastern Florida, primarily during 2 to 3hour periods. The highest official rainfall total peaked at 2.5inches (64mm) at Orlando Executive Airport, though unofficial totals reached as high as 4.8inches (122mm) in Rockledge. Rainfall was higher in western Florida, peaking at 7.64inches (194mm) in DeSoto County with an area near Tampa reporting over 7inches (175mm).|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} approached the United States East Coast on August 31, the United States Weather Bureau advised <b>extreme</b> <b>caution</b> to ships between Cape Hatteras and southern areas of New England. Storm warnings were issued for coastal regions between Wilmington, North Carolina and the Virginia Capes. These warnings were later extended northward to the Delaware Breakwater. Strong winds exceeding gale-force were expected {{for much of}} the East Coast, particularly for Cape Hatteras. On September1, hurricane warnings were ordered for areas from Hatteras, North Carolina to Pamlico Sound, while previously issued storm warnings remained in place. On September2, gale warnings extended further north into Nantucket, Massachusetts. In Norfolk, Virginia, city department heads were ordered to stand by for potential emergency duties. United States Coast Guard personnel were also dispatched along the North Carolina coast. United States Navy personnel were detained in New London, Connecticut until the storm passed. In Westhampton, New York, a mass evacuation occurred, involving 10,000residences. Air traffic to and from Mitchel Air Force Base was cancelled, and 100airplanes stationed at the base were fastened to the ground. Police and firemen evacuated a 50mi (80km) stretch of the Rhode Island coastline. This included Roy Carpenter's Beach, where 1,000families were forced to evacuate. In Narragansett Bay, boats were sent back to harbors or towed to shore. The extensive precautionary measures undertaken occurred in part due to fears that the storm would cause similar effects to a destructive hurricane which swept through areas of New England two years prior.|$|E
60|$|At first Lord Carteret {{considered}} it a thousand pities {{that they should not}} have contrived matters better so as to take Sir Richard alive; but upon reflection he was careful not to exaggerate to himself the loss occasioned by his death, for Sir Richard, after all, was a notoriously stubborn man, not in the least likely to have made any avowals worth having. So that his trial, whilst probably resulting sterile of such results as the government could desire, would have given publicity to the matter of a plot that was hatching; and such publicity at a time of so much unrest was the last thing the government desired.

30|$|Although it {{has been}} {{evidenced}} that genome editing techniques have minimal impacts on genomic mutational load in human pluripotent stem cells using whole-genome sequencing (Smith et al., 2014; Suzuki et al., 2014; Veres et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2014), the safety issue of gene editing in germ line cells still deserves <b>extreme</b> <b>cautions</b> as such changes are permanent and heritable. For the mito-TALEN-based gene editing technique in germ cells or embryos, the concentration of injected mRNA should be precisely optimized in order to guarantee good incision efficiency while avoiding increasing off-target risks. On the other hand, {{in order to test}} if the mitochondria-locating TALEN could leak to nucleus which may lead to unpredicted incision and mutation on nuclear DNA, a thorough examination of whole-genome sequence {{is likely to be the}} ideal solution. Besides those mentioned challenges, we still donâ€™t know whether this mito-TALEN-based gene editing technique would work efficiently on human oocytes or embryos containing mutant mtDNA. Therefore, even if ethical obstacles could be set aside, a comprehensive technical and safety evaluation is required before any clinic trial of this new technique.|$|R
5|$|Morris was {{out soon}} after for 105 runs with the score at 166/3, having struck 14 fours and one six. His innings, which was noted for powerful, well-placed cover drives, ended {{when he hit}} Coxon to Hutton in the gully. Miller came in and Bedser bowled three {{consecutive}} outswingers to him. A fourth ball swung the other way, and Miller did not offer a shot, expecting the ball to curve away and miss the stumps. Instead, he was hit {{in front of the}} wickets and given out lbw for four. O'Reilly said Miller's display was more akin to that of a tail-end batsman with minimal skill, and blamed his poor form with the bat on an excessive workload imposed on him by Bradman. With two quick wickets, England had put the match back in the balance. Batting out of position in the middle-order, Brown came in at 173/4 and helped Hassett to rebuild the innings. Both scored slowly, averaging more than three and a half minutes for each run. They realised Australia could not afford to lose any more wickets quickly and batted with <b>extreme</b> <b>caution,</b> reluctant even to attack long hops. Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley, who was bowling mainly in order to allow his frontline bowlers to recuperate, broke through his defences with a yorker. The English skipper trapped Brown lbw nine runs later to leave Australia at 225/6. Brown had hit two consecutive half-volleys off his pads through the leg side for four, and attempted a third boundary in a row to a similar delivery. However, this third delivery came off the pitch more quickly and beat Brown for pace.|$|E

40|$|When recommending a {{specific}} pharmaceutical, more {{has to be}} taken into account than whether the API is indicated for the illness in question. Based on the preceding discussion, product source can have a tremendous impact on efficacy, on therapeutic success, and on practitioners' credibility in the eyes of their clients. However, product source goes beyond simple credibility, encompassing professional ethics and liability. In answering the Ethical question of the month [...] December 2001 "Should private veterinary practitioners be allowed to produce autogenous vaccines or compound antimicrobial products for use in food producing animals?" Rollin concluded, "one cannot envision a clearer case of unethical behavior. " The reality is that quality assurance, efficacy, potency, and safety are not defined for compounded products, and should veterinarians choose to script or dispense one, the responsibility for its quality, efficacy, potency, and safety falls squarely on their shoulders. Ultimately, this also translates into 100 % liability should an ADR, illness, or lack of effect, befall the patient. While having access to ELDU and compounded products is crucial in facilitating the treatment of the various diseases that veterinarians face, the regulatory freedom that gives them this choice carries heightened responsibilities when electing this option. In a nutshell, ethical and responsible principles of pharmacy dictate that a veterinarian's first choice should be a veterinary-licensed pharmaceutical for the indication in question. Should this not exist, ELDU of a licensed product with clinically derived therapeutic protocols should be the next choice. Compounded pharmaceuticals should only be used when no licensed (those sporting a DIN) product exists, and <b>extreme</b> <b>cautions</b> should be exercised when using transdermal formulations. Liability dictates that this decision be undertaken with informed consent of the owner and with appropriate due diligence when selecting a compounding service provider.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Short Root Anomaly (SRA) is an {{uncommon}} disease and {{a challenge for}} orthodontic treatment as it tends to {{increase the risk of}} root resorption. OBJECTIVE: Assess the current status of the diagnosis, etiology and orthodontic management of teeth with SRA, and present case reports. METHOD: A literature review was carried out in PubMed, SciELO, LILACS, Scopus and Web of Science databases. RESULTS: A differential diagnosis of SRA should be conducted for teeth with incomplete root formation, external apical root resorption, dentin dysplasia type I and post dental trauma root hypoplasia. SRA is genetically determined and orthodontic movement requires changes in clinical and radiographic management in order to restrict damage. CONCLUSION: Orthodontic movement of teeth with SRA is contraindicated in <b>extreme</b> cases, only. <b>Caution</b> at all stages could minimize attachment loss and lead to long-term stability...|$|R

Caution must be exercised throughout the postoperative course when these patients are at greatest risk for device failure or further injury. Case presentation We present our experience of treating such a fracture where a patient presented with a non-united fracture of the humerus. The bone was already osteoporotic. We successfully used a new technique {{which has not been}} described in the literature before. This included the use of a high-speed drill to prepare the bone for screw fixation. Bone healing was augmented with bone morphogenic protein. Conclusion This technique can give invaluable experience to surgeons who are involved in treating these types of fracture. </p...|$|R

40|$|Government's {{ever-increasing}} {{participation in}} communication processes, Mark Yudof argues, threatens key democratic values that the First Amendment {{was designed to}} protect. Government control over the exchange of ideas and information would be inconsistent with citizen autonomy, informed consent, and a balanced and mutually responsive relationship between citizens and their government. Yet the danger of government dominance must be weighed against the necessary role of government in furthering democratic values by proposing and promotion policies and by disseminating information and educating citizens. Restraints on government's ability to control communications processes are desirable, but excessive or inappropriate restrictions threaten democracy.
