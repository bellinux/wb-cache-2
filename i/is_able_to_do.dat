He was delayed in Jeddah when his U.S. citizenship and inability to speak Arabic caused his status as a Muslim to be questioned. He had received Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam's book The Eternal Message of Muhammad with his visa approval, and he contacted the author. Azzam's son arranged for his release and lent him his personal hotel suite. The next morning MalcolmX learned that Prince Faisal had designated him as a state guest. Several days later, after completing the Hajj rituals, MalcolmX had an audience with the prince.|$|E

Rush and Irina's parents, once found, reveal that their research at the academy had been to create tablets that can transform Remnants and it is through one of these that Wagram stole that the Conqueror <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. When the party travels to the God-Emperor's city, Undelwalt, to try to determine why he is supporting the Conqueror, they find Wagram, who tells them that the Conqueror is a Remnant himself. Wagram and the God-Emperor are supporting him in his quest to destroy the people of the world, who are misusing Remnants and destroying the balance of the world.|$|E

Chris immediately becomes friends with the store owner, Carl, and he {{is given a}} large promotion which Carl originally promised to Meg. When Meg takes issue with this, she is fired. Lois, to whom Meg has told of her plight, explains the situation to Chris and tells him to stand up for Meg by getting her job back. Chris <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this after bribing Carl by withholding his opinions of movies he and Carl normally discuss until Carl re-hires her. Meg, in turn, rejects working at the store again, as she only had Chris get her job back to see if he would stand up for her.|$|E

25|$|RNAP accomplishes de novo synthesis. It <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{this because}} {{specific}} {{interactions with the}} initiating nucleotide hold RNAP rigidly in place, facilitating chemical attack on the incoming nucleotide. Such specific interactions explain why RNAP prefers to start transcripts with ATP (followed by GTP, UTP, and then CTP). In contrast to DNA polymerase, RNAP includes helicase activity, therefore no separate enzyme is needed to unwind DNA.|$|E

It is logical that the United States should do whatever it <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to assist in the return of normal economic health to the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace. Our policy is not directed against any country, but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Any government that is willing to assist in recovery will find full co-operation on the part of the USA. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.|$|E

25|$|Systems that don't have {{a trusted}} {{computing}} base {{as part of their}} design do not provide security of their own: they are only secure insofar as security is provided to them by external means (e.g. a computer sitting in a locked room without a network connection may be considered secure depending on the policy, regardless of the software it runs). This is because, as David J. Farber et al. put it, n a computer system, the integrity of lower layers is typically treated as axiomatic by higher layers. As far as computer security is concerned, reasoning about the security properties of a computer system requires being able to make sound assumptions about what it can, and more importantly, cannot do; however, barring any reason to believe otherwise, a computer <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> everything that a general Von Neumann machine can. This obviously includes operations that would be deemed contrary to all but the simplest security policies, such as divulging an email or password that should be kept secret; however, barring special provisions in the architecture of the system, there is no denying that the computer could be programmed to perform these undesirable tasks.|$|E
500|$|The prefix hyper- is {{sometimes}} added to describe movement beyond the normal limits, {{such as in}} hypermobility, hyperflexion or hyperextension. The range of motion describes the total range of motion that a joint <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> [...] For example, if {{a part of the}} body such as a joint is overstretched or [...] "bent backwards" [...] because of exaggerated extension motion, then it can be described as hyperextended. Hyperextension increases the stress on the ligaments of a joint, and is not always because of a voluntary movement. It may be a result of accidents, falls, or other causes of trauma. It may also be used in surgery, such as in temporarily dislocating joints for surgical procedures.|$|E
500|$|Well, I didn’t {{know how}} long the comic book series was going to last. I hoped that it would become a success and survive for years and years.

I set up this love {{triangle}} and I resolved that story and moved along within the first [...] issues. But there's a lot of story potential to mine there. One {{of the things that the}} TV show <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to look at the comic book series with hindsight and go, 'This would probably be something that we could explore more.' And that's what we're going to be doing. So we'll be seeing a lot more of the Lori-Shane-Rick love triangle.|$|E

[...] Travis Fickett of IGN gave the episode a favorable review, saying [...] "This episode {{is a prime}} example of how The Office <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> broad comedy while at the same time treating its characters as real people." [...] Fickett went on to praise the acting of Rainn Wilson as a depressed Dwight, as well as the story's twist. [...] Fickett stated that [...] "A great twist here is that we think we're watching Michael pilot a sinking ship as usual, but in fact – the ad is quite good. There's some clever stuff in there, albeit some of it not exactly professional in its production, but Michael doesn't do such a bad job." [...] Like Fickett, Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a favorable review. [...] Fenno said that [...] "The premise of this episode, 'Local Ad' — the Scranton staffers shoot a commercial — was strong, and allowed almost every ensemble member to shine." [...] Fenno also praised the acting work of Ed Helms as Andy, as well as Steve Carell as Michael. [...] Oscar Dahl, a Senior Writer for BuddyTV, praised the episode, but also felt that the episode's thirty-minute length created a stark contrast to the previous four episodes' hour-long run, saying [...] "tonight's episode felt short.

500|$|Fighters Uncaged is a single-player-only {{fighting}} game controlled {{using the}} Kinect, a motion sensing input device. The player controls {{the protagonist of}} the game, Simon, through his attempts to win an illegal fighting tournament to help get his father out of trouble with a crime lord. The game features one gamemode called [...] "Fight" [...] which is only accessible after completing the tutorial. Fighters Uncaged is played in an over-the-shoulder perspective, with the opponent being on the opposite side. Simon <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a range of different actions, including short and long punches, kicks, blocks, dodges, and headbutts. The player can execute special moves via shouting {{in the direction of}} the Kinect, once the corresponding bar is full. Fighting consists of looking for telegraphs in the movements of one's opponents to figure out when to dodge or block attacks, then hitting them while they are vulnerable. In the early stages Fighters Uncaged, it is made less difficult to read the telegraphs of the opponent, but as the player progresses, they become increasingly imperceptible. The moves Simon can complete depend on where the opponent is at the time, and therefore only certain moves will land hits at particular moments. Fighters Uncaged features different leagues, with higher leagues being reached by having a certain number of points. Points are obtained by defeating the opponent, while having a good score. Good scores are attained by accomplishing counter attacks, exploiting the enemies weak spots, and correctly completing combos. If a good score is not secured at the end of the fight, no points are rewarded.|$|E
