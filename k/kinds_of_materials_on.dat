30|$|This work {{studies the}} hole {{patterning}} <b>of</b> the mask <b>material</b> for the subsequent SAG of GaN NCs by PA-MBE. Three different techniques are reported that were successfully used to pre-pattern {{the surface of}} a thin Ti mask with ordered arrays of nanoholes: EBL followed by dry etch, colloidal lithography [CL], and FIB. The critical issues encountered in the mask fabrication processes are studied in detail. More specifically, the effects of surface roughness, adhesion of the mask layer to the substrate, and surface cleanliness on the following GaN NCs SAG are analyzed. For each of the mentioned techniques, the main advantages and drawbacks are highlighted. Only when the patterning process was optimized, high-quality hole-patterned masks of different dimensions and geometry were obtained. These masks were subsequently used to grow ordered crystalline GaN NCs in the SAG mode by PA-MBE. The technological issues discussed in this work {{can be applied to the}} ordered growth <b>of</b> any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> <b>on</b> various substrates.|$|R

We use the t-t^'-J model on the honeycomb lattice as our starting point and employ the slave-boson mean-field theory. In the antiferromagnetic normal state, the characteristic doping evolution of Fermi surface shows that only one effective singe band is active, {{which suggests that the}} potential pairing symmetry is the time-reversal symmetry breaking d+id, rather than the extended s-wave. It is found that this superconducting state coexists with the antiferromagnetism in a broad doping regime, which is consistent with the numerical calculations. The local density of states and its thermodynamic property of the superconducting state has been studied in detail with an effective single-band picture for understanding other physical observable such as superfluid density.

For the local fiber orientation, the anisotropy rotary diffusion-reduced strain closure have been used which is typical for fibers longer than 2 mm. Using well known micro mechanic formulas allow to combine the local fiber length with the local orientation into local mechanical properties.

Mg 2 SiO 4 (M 2 S) ceramic has been reported as a novel bioceramic with higher mechanical properties and good biocompatibility recently. b-Ca 2 (PO 4) 2 (b-TCP) ceramic is a well-known bioactive and degradable material for bone repair. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate and compare the effect of three bioceramics with different chemical composition on the in vitro degradation, apatite-forming ability in simulated body fluid (SBF) and cytocompatibility. The degradation was evaluated through the activation energy of Si or P ion released from ceramics and the weight loss of the ceramics in Tris-HCl buffer solution. Formation of bone-like apatite on different bioceramic surfaces was investigated in SBF.

40|$|Rolled-up {{nanotechnology}} {{based on}} strain-engineering {{is a powerful}} tool to manufacture three-dimensional hollow structures made <b>of</b> virtually any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> <b>on</b> a large variety of substrates. The aim of this thesis is to address the key features of different on- and off-chip applications of rolled-up microtubes through modification of their basic framework. The modification of the framework pertains to the tubular structure, in particular {{the diameter of the}} microtube, and the material which it is made of, hence achieving different functionalities of the final rolled-up structure. The tuning of the microtube diameter which is adjusted to the individual size of an object allows on-chip studies of single cells in artificial narrow cavities, for example. Another modification of the framework is the addition of a catalytic layer which turns the microtube into a self-propelled catalytic micro-engine. Furthermore, the tuneability of the diameter can have applications ranging from nanotools for drilling into cells, to cargo transporters in microfluidic channels. Especially rolled-up microtubes based on low-cost and easy to deposit materials, such as silicon oxides, can enable the exploration of novel systems for several scientific topics. The main objective of this thesis is to combine microfluidic features of rolled-up structures with optical sensor capabilities of silicon oxide microtubes acting as optical ring resonators, and to integrate these into a Lab-on-a-Chip system. Therefore, a new concept of microfluidic integration is developed in order to establish an inexpensive, reliable and reproducible fabrication process which also sustains the optical capabilities of the microtubes. These integrated microtubes act as optofluidic refractrometric sensors which detect changes in the refractive index of analytes using photoluminescence spectroscopy. The thesis concludes with a demonstration of a functional portable sensor device with several integrated optofluidic sensors. Die auf verspannten Dünnschichten basierende „rolled-up nanotechnologie“ ist eine leistungsfähige Methode um dreidimensionale hohle Strukturen (Mikroröhrchen) aus nahezu jeder Art von Material auf einer großen Vielfalt von Substraten herzustellen. Ausgehend von der Möglichkeit der Skalierung des Röhrchendurchmessers und der Modifikation der Funktionalität des Röhrchens durch Einsatz verschiedener Materialien und Oberflächenfunktionalisierungen kann eine große Anzahl an verschiedenen Anwendungen ermöglicht werden. Eine Anwendung behandelt unter anderem on-chip Studien einzelner Zellen wobei die Mikroröhrchen, an die Größe der Zelle angepasste, Reaktionscontainer darstellen. Eine weitere Modifikation der Funktionalität der Mikroröhrchen kann durch das Aufbringen einer katalytischen Schicht realisiert werden, wodurch das Mikroröhrchen zu einem selbstangetriebenen katalytischen Mikro-Motor wird. Hauptziel dieser Arbeit ist es Mikrometer große optisch aktive Glasröhrchen herzustellen, diese mikrofluidisch zu kontaktieren und als Sensoren in Lab-on-a-Chip Systeme zu integrieren. Die integrierten Glasröhrchen arbeiten als optofluidische Ringresonatoren, welche die Veränderungen des Brechungsindex von Fluiden im inneren des Röhrchens durch Änderungen im Evaneszenzfeld detektieren können. Die Funktionsfähigkeit eines Demonstrators wird mit verschiedenen Flüssigkeiten gezeigt, dabei kommt ein Fotolumineszenz Spektrometer zum Anregen des Evaneszenzfeldes und Auslesen des Signals zum Einsatz. Die entwickelte Integrationsmethode ist eine Basis für ein kostengünstiges, zuverlässiges und reproduzierbares Herstellungsverfahren von optofluidischen Mikrochips basierend auf optisch aktiven Mikroröhrchen...|$|R
40|$|A fully {{automated}} method involving dialysis combined with trace enrichment {{was developed for}} the liquid chromatographic (LC) determination of atenolol, a hydrophilic beta-blocking agent, in human plasma. The plasma samples were dialysed on a cellulose acetate membrane and the dialysate was reconcentrated on a short trace enrichment column (TEC) packed with a strong cation-exchange material. All sample handling operations can be executed automatically by a sample processor (ASTED system). After TEC conditioning, the plasma sample, to which the internal standard (sotalol, another hydrophilic beta-blocker) was automatically added, {{was introduced in the}} donor channel and dialysed in the static/pulsed mode. The dialysis liquid consisted of 4. 3 mM phosphoric acid. When the dialysis process was discontinued, the analytes were eluted from the TEC in the back-flush mode by the LC mobile phase and transferred to the analytical column, packed with octyl silica. The LC mobile phase consisted of phosphate buffer, pH 7. 0 -methanol (81 : 19; v/v) with 1 -octanesulfonate. Atenolol and the internal standard were monitored photometrically at 225 nm. The different parameters influencing the dialysis and trace enrichment processes were optimised with respect to analyte recovery. The influence <b>of</b> two different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> cation-exchange <b>material</b> <b>on</b> analyte recovery and peak efficiency was also studied. The method was then validated in the concentration range 25 - 1000 ng/ml. The mean recovery for atenolol was 65 % and the limit of quantitation was 25 ng/ml. Peer reviewe...|$|R
