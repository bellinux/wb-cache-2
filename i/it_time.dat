5|$|The larvae {{of several}} species of starfish can {{reproduce}} asexually before they reach maturity. They do this by autotomising some parts of their bodies or by budding. When such a larva senses that food is plentiful, it takes the path of asexual reproduction rather than normal development. Though this costs <b>it</b> <b>time</b> and energy and delays maturity, it allows a single larva to give rise to multiple adults when the conditions are appropriate.|$|E
5|$|Despite losing {{much of its}} {{convection}} over land, Hudah {{maintained a}} well-organized cloud structure once in the Mozambique Channel on April3. As a result of moving back over warm waters, the system began to re-intensify, and attained moderate tropical storm intensity at 0000UTC on April4. Meanwhile, a large central dense overcast developed, and Hudah began to track west-southwestward as opposed to its previous westward trajectory. Despite computer forecast models suggesting that Hudah would continue westward, the storm instead turn to a southward drift, giving <b>it</b> <b>time</b> to strengthen in the Mozambique Channel. This {{was the result of}} a mid-latitude trough weakening the nearby subtropical ridge. By 1800UTC on April5, Hudah was upgraded back to tropical cyclone intensity. A banding eye began to appear on satellite imagery, though it remained generally unstable, and a large banding feature formed over the western half of Hudah. The nearby trough later weakened in intensity, causing the tropical cyclone to move north-northwestward towards the Mozambique coast on April7. It was at this time that Hudah reached a tertiary peak intensity with winds of 160km/h (100mph). The tropical cyclone accelerated northwards throughout the day, eventually making its final landfall near Pebane, Mozambique at 0600UTC on April8 as a slightly weaker storm. Once inland, Hudah rapidly weakened, and was no longer tracked by the MFR by 0000UTC on April9. The JTWC issued its final warning on the system six hours later, as the remnants of Hudah moved through northeastern Mozambique, producing spotty convection.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor learns Scaroth {{threatens to}} destroy Paris if Romana does not {{continue}} the work. He tries {{to gain the}} Countess' help by showing the Count's true form, but he kills her. Romana completes the adjustments, and Scaroth uses it {{to travel to the}} past. The Doctor quickly ushers Romana and Duggan to the TARDIS, fearing that the ship's explosion was the spark that started the development of life on Earth, and if Scaroth should prevent it, humanity would not come about. They arrive <b>it</b> <b>time</b> for Duggan to knock Scaroth out before he can reach the ship. Scaroth's body returns to the present, and when his alien form is discovered by his bodyguard, they get into a fight that damages the equipment and sets the mansion on fire, killing them both. By the time the Doctor, Romana and Duggan arrive, the original Mona Lisa and 5 of the 6 copies have been burnt, but the last copy remains safe. Duggan argues that they've lost an invaluable piece of art, but the Doctor assures him that the copy, still done by da Vinci's hand, will go unnoticed, and that art is worthless if its monetary value is all that matters. The Doctor and Romana say goodbye to Duggan at the Eiffel Tower.|$|E

Both Lincoln and Grant acknowledged his effectiveness in their behalf, and as a crusading civil reformer he helped destroy the corrupt Tweed Ring that swindled New York City of millions of dollars.

The MCC continued to entertain the crowd and get some batting practice; May made 56, Watson 38, Graveney 50 and Mortimore 50, the Country team using 10 bowlers and Thomlinson taking 3/60 before they ended on 308/8.|$|E
25|$|In September 1960, the VR {{announced}} that the remaining X, D1, D2, D4, E and Y class locomotives were to be withdrawn within the next six months. Members of the Australian Railway Historical Society (ARHS) {{and a number of}} VR employees, aware that these locomotive classes were about to vanish just as the S class had six years earlier, began making approaches to the Victorian Railway Commissioners suggesting that an example of each of the various classes still in existence be preserved in a railway museum. On 17 November, the last two X class locomotives in service were withdrawn, and X36 hauled X29 dead-attached back to Newport Workshops where both were to be scrapped. By {{the end of the year}} X29 was already largely cut up, and VR employees sympathetic to preservation efforts had moved X36 to the back of the scrapping row to buy <b>it</b> <b>time</b> as negotiations continued over its future. In February 1961 the ARHS met with the VR and succeeded in securing a temporary hold on X36's scrapping until 1 April 1961. When that date passed without resolution, X36 was again moved back to the scrapping row. However, the locomotive was saved when the office of the VR Chief Mechanical Engineer intervened at the eleventh hour and deferred the scrapping.|$|E

During the song Drake makes multiple pop culture references including Dwight Howard, University of Nevada, Las Vegas basketball, comparisons to Guy Pearce in Memento, and details of dates with Tatyana Ali.

A small troupe toured the provinces, with Sybil Thorndike at its head. By 1944, with the tide of the war turning, Guthrie felt <b>it</b> <b>time</b> to re-establish the company in a London base and invited Richardson to head it.

500|$|In December 2015, Bolton, {{who were}} £172.9 million in debt, were handed a {{winding-up}} petition from HM Revenue and Customs over unpaid taxes, and a transfer embargo {{for the following}} month's window.

On 18 January 2016, the club avoided an immediate winding-up order after their case was adjourned until 22 February to give <b>it</b> <b>time</b> to either close a deal with a potential buyer or raise sufficient short-term funds from asset sales.

500|$|During the 2000 presidential election, the {{readiness}} of the 10th Mountain Division became a political issue when George W. Bush asserted that the division was [...] "not ready for duty." [...] He attributed the division's low readiness to the frequent deployments throughout the 1990s without time in between for division elements to retrain and refit. A report from the US General Accounting Office in July 2000 also noted that although the entire 10th Mountain Division was not deployed to the contingencies at once, [...] "deployment of key components—especially headquarters—makes these divisions unavailable for deployment elsewhere {{in case of a}} major war". Conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation agreed with these sentiments, charging that the US military overall was not prepared for war due to post-Cold War drawdowns of the US Military. The Army responded that, though the 10th Mountain Division had been unprepared following its deployment as Task Force Eagle, that the unit was fully prepared for combat by late 2000 despite being undermanned. Still, the Army moved the 10th Mountain Division down on the deployment list, allowing <b>it</b> <b>time</b> to retrain and refit.|$|E
