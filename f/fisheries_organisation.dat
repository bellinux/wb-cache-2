40|$|International <b>fisheries</b> <b>organisations</b> {{have been}} in {{existence}} since 1902. 1 Their emergence over the years {{was not on the}} basis of a logically consistent and overall design, but on when States identified the need for international cooperation in the management of fisheries. The introduction of international <b>fisheries</b> <b>organisations</b> may therefore be characterised as piecemeal and as ad hoc responses to specific concerns such as the need to obtain the best scientific information on a fishery, the management and status of shared stocks, and cooperation between fishing States. Heightened international concerns arising from overfishing and the Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing activity gave impetus to the work of international <b>fisheries</b> <b>organisations</b> and led to the negotiation of international fisheries instruments built upon the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 2. The adoption of the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement 3 was pivotal in improving international coordination in the establishment and responsibilities of regional and subregional <b>fisheries</b> management <b>organisations</b> and arrangements. 4 As international and regional <b>fisheries</b> <b>organisations</b> have evolved to address concerns, it is posited that international law has in parallel evolved in response to necessities and crises in fisheries. Given the pace of decision-making and activity of regional <b>fisheries</b> <b>organisations,</b> it is useful at this juncture to take stock of their influence and interaction on distinct areas of international law. By doing so, one can take stock of the trends influenced by these organisations. This thesis is devoted to assessing the practice of tuna Regional <b>Fisheries</b> Management <b>Organisations</b> (RFMOs) and their individual and collective influence on international law. The practice of tuna RFMOs may in fact be challenging and at the same time influencing changes in the implementation of “traditional” international law precepts such as the sovereignty of a port State over its ports, the primacy of flag State jurisdiction, non-flag State enforcement on the high seas, the sovereign rights of a coastal State in exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing living resources within its exclusive economic zone, and the sources of international law...|$|R

However, the effectiveness of MPAs is affected not only by ecological factors but also by social ones. According to Leverington et al.

A characteristic function game approach is applied to describe the sharing of the surplus benefits from cooperation. We are specifically interested in the effect of possible coalition restrictions on these shares. According to our results the distant water fishing nations, by refusing to join with the coastal states, can improve their negotiation position if their fishing costs are high. In addition, we are also allowing for unlimited number of fishing nations in the regional <b>fisheries</b> <b>organisation.</b> The veto players always receive an equal share of the benefits and the least efficient country is seen to make no contribution to the cooperative management regime...|$|E

40|$|From 1993 to 1995, the United Nations Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, {{addressed}} a worldwide fisheries management crisis, focussed on straddling and {{highly migratory fish}} stocks. The Conference brought forth the U. N. Fish Stocks Agreement, which became available for signing in December, 1995. At the end of 2001, the Agreement achieved the status of international treaty law. During the intervening six years, the Agreement had already come {{to serve as a}} framework for an increasing number of regimes.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} commercial fish stocks {{in the waters of}} eastern Canada straddle the boundary between Canada's exclusive fishing zone and the high seas. Management of these stocks by Canada and the Northwest Atlantic <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Organisation</b> (NAFO) has failed to prevent stock depletion. It is argued that NAFO has faced a major problem in developing a successful management regime for these straddling stocks: lack of an effective enforcement capability to make members comply with its total allowable catches (TACs), quota allocations, and technical measures and to prevent nonmember fishing within its Regulatory Area. Long-standing Canadian concern about NAFO's ability to enforce proper management of straddling stocks in the high seas area of the Grand Banks, prompted passage of an amended Coastal Fisheries Protection Act in May 1994 which allowed Canada to arrest and fine foreign vessels fishing beyond Canada's exclusive fishing zone (EFZ) in contravention of NAFO's conservation and management regime. It appears that use of this Act in 1994 eliminated fishing by non-members on the Nose and Tail of the Bank, while action against Spanish and Portuguse vessels in March 1995 may provide the help that NAFO needs in terms of noncompliance with its management regime by member states. ...|$|E

30|$|Livestock {{production}} and consumption of meat are significant contributors to today’s most serious environmental problems and global warming. This paper investigates the role of marine reserves in shaping meat consumption pattern across member countries of the South East Atlantic <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Organisation</b> (SEAFO) for the period 1990 to 2009. Using a panel data including economic factors, life expectancy and environmental awareness, we find that meat consumption is positively associated {{with the presence of}} marine protected areas (MPAs). This suggests a possible increase in substitution of meat eating to seafood by SEAFO member countries due to aquatic resources conservation. Marine resource conservation policy is not a complementary strategy for sustainable livestock policy. This points out to some necessary policy improvements and actions to ameliorate the relationship between MPA and the negative environmental impacts of livestock. Furthermore, economic factors appear to have {{played a significant role in}} explaining meat consumption growth. Apart from price inflation, the most relevant factors that positively influence meat consumption appear to be GDP, exports and imports of agricultural products, and urbanisation. Beyond economic factors, negative health information associated with meat consumption appear to lead to a reduction in the consumed quantities of meat. There is evidence that meat-eating behaviour is not only related to macroeconomic development but also to environmental awareness.|$|E
40|$|The {{monitoring}} of fish stocks {{as well as}} the magnitude, distribution and trends of fishing effort and fish catches is required for sound fisheries resources management. Conducting regular Catch Assessment Surveys (CASs) in Lake Victoria is one of the ways through which the partner states sharing the lake are generating information to contribute to the above process. The EU funded Implementation of a Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP) project for Lake Victoria through the Lake Victoria <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Organisation</b> (LVFO) is supporting the implementation of regionally harmonised CASs in Lake Victoria. The CASs under IFMP are following a statistical design laid down in Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) agreed by the three partner states of the East African Community sharing the lake. In the Ugandan part of the lake, the CASs are carried out at 54 fish landing sites selected in the eleven riparian districts sharing the lake. The National Fisheries Resources Research Institute (NAFIRRI), Jinja; the Department of Fisheries Resources (DFR), Entebbe; and the Districts of Busia, Bugiri, Mayuge, Jinja, Mukono, Wakiso, Kampala, Mpigi, Masaka, Kalangala and Rakai jointly conduct the surveys.

40|$|Multi-species and {{ecosystem}} modelling are increasingly touted as essential approaches {{in the future}} of fisheries management. These methodologies can involve the amalgamation of data on the landings, biomass, consumption, production, and diets of many species or species groups in current time, the future and in the re-examination of the past. The Ecopath approach was used to construct two mass balance ecosystem models for the southern Labrador Shelf, Northeast Newfoundland Shelf and Grand Bank in Northwest Atlantic <b>Fisheries</b> <b>Organisation</b> (NAFO) Divisions 2 J+ 3 KLNO the first for the time period 1954 - 1956 and the second for 1968 - 1970. Our models increased the temporal resolution of ecosystem models developed by The Fisheries Centre at the University of British Columbia. The start (1950 s) and rapid expansion (1960 s) of industrial harvesting by factory freezer trawlers during these time periods resulted in massive increases in fishing effort, the total catch increased by 30 %, and there was extensive spatial intensification and expansion, particularly on the Labrador Shelf. Biomass declines in adult and juvenile Atlantic cod, harp seals, and their main prey species capelin and sandlance were evident. A change in predator/prey relationships between the two time periods was expected, but not found. An increase in the biomass of some invertebrate species groups was expected, but not evident, possibly due to sparse historical data. System ratios and indicators pointed to the latter ecosystem as nearer to a state of being 'fished down', perhaps indicating the onset of the trophic shift evident in the late 1980 s and 1990 s...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the new member problem {{faced by the}} {{regional}} <b>fisheries</b> management <b>organisations</b> is discussed for a typical highly migratory species: the northern Atlantic bluefin tuna. The analysis is based on simulation and optimisation results from a bio-economic model. The results, for both the East and the West Atlantic stocks, show that presently {{the threat of the}} new members is not relevant for the breakdown of the cooperative management. This is due to the very low level of the stock, which makes non-cooperation a low payoff strategy. As the optimal cooperative strategy calls for an initial harvest moratorium the threat becomes progressively more relevant, showing that this is a dynamic problem which is aggravated in the long run. Two possible solutions for this problem are simulated: “transferable membership ” and “waiting period”. The simulation results show that a “transferable membership ” scheme, if properly implemented, is fully efficient in protecting the cooperative agreements of the regional <b>fisheries</b> <b>organisations</b> from the free rider actions of the prospective new members.
