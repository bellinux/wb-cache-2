25|$|When yeast cells die, they sink to {{the bottom}} of the {{fermentation}} vessel where they combine with insoluble tartrates, grape seeds, skin and pulp fragments to form the lees. During fermentation, the first significant racking which removes the bulk of dead yeast cells is often referred to as the <b>gross</b> <b>lees</b> as opposed to the less coarse fine lees that come as the wine continues to settle and age. During the time that the wine spends in contact with the lees, a number of changes can impact the wine due to both the autolysis (or self-metabolize) of the dead yeast cells as well as the reductive conditions that can develop if the lees are not aerated or stirred (a process that the French call bâtonnage). The length of time that a wine spends on its lees (called sur lie) will depend on the winemaking style and type of wine.|$|E
40|$|Semillon and Shiraz grapes {{containing}} ochratoxin A (OA) {{were obtained}} by inoculation of bunches on the vine with Aspergillus carbonarius. Citric acid content was greater in the inoculated grapes than in healthy grapes. Samples were collected throughout vinification of these grapes and the OA content was quantified using a stable isotope dilution liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric method. The mass of processed and waste streams during vinification was also noted. Reduction {{in the amount of}} OA in juice and wine occurred at every solid-liquid separation stage. The OA concentration (μg/kg) in white and red wine after racking was 4 % and 9 %, respectively, of that in crushed grapes. This corresponds to 1 % and 6 % of the total OA content that was initially present in the inoculated grapes. The OA content was divided between solid and liquid phases at each stage of vinification. OA {{did not appear to be}} transformed either chemically or biologically by yeast during fermentation, rather was discarded with the marc, juice lees, and <b>gross</b> <b>lees.</b> Su-lin L.

40|$|Semillon and Shiraz grapes {{containing}} ochratoxin A (OA) {{were produced}} by inoculation of bunches {{on the vine}} with Aspergillus carbonarius. Small scale vinification of these grapes was performed and the OA content at various stages was analysed. Semillon must was treated with pectolytic enzymes and the juice after pressing was fined with bentonite. Neither pectolytic enzymes nor bentonite influenced the OA content of the clarified juice. Shiraz must was vinified by either static or rotary fermentation. No differences in the OA content of wine after pressing were noted. OA was concentrated in juice lees and <b>gross</b> <b>lees.</b> However, additional juice or wine recovered from lees after centrifugation did not display increased OA contamination compared to racked juice or wine. Addition of bentonite at 2. 5 g/L to a Semillon wine containing 56 mg grape-derived protein/L and ca. 8 μg OA/kg resulted in a 67 % reduction in OA concentration. Potassium caseinate showed some effect, whereas gelatin, isinglass and PVPP did not significantly diminish OA in white wine compared to wine settled without fining agents. Addition of yeast hulls at 5. 0 g/L to a Shiraz wine containing ca. 5 μg OA/kg yielded a 43 % reduction. Gelatin was also slightly effective. Storage of wine for 10 - 14 months resulted in a decrease in OA concentration of 22 % and 29 % for white and red wines, respectively. Su-Lin l. Leong, Ailsa D. Hocking and Eileen S. Scot...|$|E

40|$|Ochratoxin A (OA), a {{nephrotoxin}} {{and potential}} carcinogen, {{has been found}} in many foods, including grapes and grape products. Limits of 2 μg/kg in wine and 10 μg/kg in dried vine fruit have been introduced by the European Union. This study presents information on the ecology of ochratoxin A production by black Aspergillus spp. in Australian vineyards, and the passage of the toxin throughout winemaking. Aspergillus niger and A. carbonarius were isolated from vineyard soils in 17 of 17, and four of 17 Australian viticultural regions, respectively. A. aculeatus was isolated infrequently. All thirty-two isolates of A. carbonarius and three of 100 isolates of A. niger produced OA. Of Australian A. niger isolates analysed for restriction fragment length polymorphisms within the internal transcribed spacer region of 5. 8 S ribosomal DNA, 61 of 113 isolates, including the three toxigenic isolates, were of type N pattern, and 52 were type T. A selection of these A. carbonarius and A. niger aggregate isolates, as well as imported isolates, were compared using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) -PCR, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and microsatellite markers. ERIC and AFLP clearly differentiated A. niger from A. carbonarius. AFLP further divided A. niger into types N and T. Six polymorphic microsatellite markers, developed specifically for A. niger, also differentiated strains into N and T types. There was no clear relationship between genotypic distribution and ochratoxigenicity, substrate or geographic origin. The survival of A. carbonarius spores on filter membranes was examined at water activities (aw) 0. 4 - 1. 0, and at 1 °C, 15 °C, 25 °C and 37 °C. Survival generally increased at lower temperatures. The lowest water activity, 0. 4, best supported the survival of spores, but 0. 6 - 0. 9 aw was often deleterious. Complex interactions between temperature and water activity were observed. Viability of A. carbonarius spores on filter membranes decreased ca 10 [superscript 5] fold upon exposure to sunlight, equivalent to 10 mWh of cumulative ultraviolet irradiation at 290 - 400 nm. Growth and toxin production were examined for five isolates of A. carbonarius and two of A. niger on solid medium simulating juice at early veraison, within the range 0. 98 - 0. 92 aw, and at 15 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C and 35 °C. Maximum growth for A. carbonarius and A. niger occurred at ca 0. 965 aw / 30 °C and ca 0. 98 aw / 35 °C, respectively. The optimum temperature for OA production was 15 °C and little was produced above 25 °C. The optimum aw for toxin production was 0. 95 for A. niger and 0. 95 - 0. 98 for A. carbonarius. Toxin was produced in young colonies, however, levels were reduced as colonies aged. Black Aspergillus spp. were more commonly isolated from the surface than from the pulp of berries, and increased with berry maturity, or damage. A. niger was isolated more frequently than A. carbonarius and A. aculeatus. Populations of A. carbonarius inoculated onto bunches of Chardonnay and Shiraz decreased from pre-bunch closure to early veraison. Populations from veraison to harvest were variable, and ncreased in bunches with tight clustering and splitting. In a trial with Semillon bunches, omitting fungicide sprays after flowering did not increase the development of Aspergillus rot. Inoculation of bunches with A. carbonarius spore suspension did not necessarily result in Aspergillus bunch rot. In vitro trials suggested that the severity of rot was mediated primarily by the degree of berry damage, followed by the extent of spore coverage. No clear trends regarding cultivar susceptibility were observed. For Semillon bunches inoculated with A. carbonarius spores with and without berry puncture, increased susceptibility to rot and OA formation was associated with berry damage, in particular at greater than 12. 3 °Brix (20 d before harvest). OA contamination of bunches was related to the number of mouldy berries per bunch, with shrivelled, severely mouldy berries the primary source of OA. Puncture-inoculation of white grapes (Chardonnay and Semillon) and red grapes (Shiraz) on the vine with A. carbonarius resulted in berries containing OA. Inoculated grapes displayed greater total soluble solids due to berry shrivelling, and greater titratable acidity due to production of citric acid by the fungus. Samples taken throughout vinification of these grapes were analysed for OA. Pressing resulted in the greatest reduction in OA (68 - 85 % decrease in concentration, compared with that of crushed grapes). Additional reductions occurred at racking from grape and <b>gross</b> <b>lees,</b> and after storage. OA was removed by binding to marc, grape and <b>gross</b> <b>lees.</b> Pectolytic enzyme treatment of white must, bentonite juice fining, recovery of juice or wine from lees, and static or rotary style fermentation of red must, had no effect on OA contamination. Bentonite in white wine (containing 56 mg/L grape-derived proteins) and yeast hulls in red wine were effective fining agents for removing OA. Findings from these studies may contribute to the improvement of strategies to minimise OA in Australian wine and dried vine fruit. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Drones {{are often}} used for aerial photography. The main way people {{currently}} control them is using a joystick that controls the pitch, yaw, roll and throttle of the drone. With the joystick, a user has to think {{not only in terms}} of the desired image but also how the drone needs to move in order to capture it. We implemented a gestural system that would allow the user to control a drone in a more intuitive manner that abstracts away low-level motor controls. The idea is to allow a user to manipulate the current frame using touch gestures to indicate the intended shot. The four gestures we support are dragging, pinching, two finger rotation and two finger drag. The feedback consists of the live feed from the camera, as well as a preview of the image transformation that was indicated. When the user lifts their fingers, the commands are sent to the drone so it can execute the movements that will result in the desired image. The system works but has some limitations that are imposed by the drones flight-path API. These limitations deal with the path and the heading used during flight. The drone's final view is qualitatively close to the desired image as indicated by the gesture. by <b>Lee</b> <b>Gross.</b> Thesis: M.
