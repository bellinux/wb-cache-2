Although it is known that the spread of Islam began in the west of the archipelago, the fragmentary evidence does not suggest a rolling wave of conversion through adjacent areas; rather, it suggests the process was complicated and slow. The spread of Islam was driven by increasing trade links outside of the archipelago; in <b>general,</b> <b>traders</b> and the royalty of major kingdoms were the first to adopt the new religion.|$|E

50|$|Irvine's Landing was {{the first}} post-contact {{settlement}} in the Pender Harbour area, and quickly became a hub for supplies and provisions. The first settler in Pender Harbour was an English immigrant named Charles Irvine, who established a small trading post in 1865. Steve Dames, a displaced seaman from Riga, Latvia, and Joe Perry of Cape Verde became familiar with Irvine's Landing, and purchased it in 1898. Perry's father-in-law, Joseph Gonsalves of Madeira Island, later moved up from Brockton Point (now Stanley Park in Vancouver). Under the name Gonsalves and Dames <b>General</b> <b>Traders,</b> they expanded their holdings and built the Irvine's Landing Hotel and Store. An early Union Steamer stop for settlers and loggers, it grew into a fish-processing centre and later a yacht anchorage and vacation spot.|$|E
50|$|The first Indonesians {{to adopt}} Islam {{are thought to}} have done so as early as the {{eleventh}} century, although Muslims had visited Indonesia early in the Muslim era. The spread of Islam was driven by increasing trade links outside of the archipelago; in <b>general,</b> <b>traders</b> and the royalty of major kingdoms were the first to adopt the new religion. Dominant kingdoms included Mataram in Central Java, and the sultanates of Ternate and Tidore in the Maluku Islands to the east. By the end of the thirteenth century, Islam had been established in North Sumatra; by the fourteenth in northeast Malaya, Brunei, the southern Philippines and among some courtiers of East Java; and the fifteenth in Malacca and other areas of the Malay Peninsula. Through assimilation Islam had supplanted Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion of Java and Sumatra {{by the end of the}} 16th century. At this time, only Bali retained a Hindu majority and the outer islands remained largely animist but would adopt Islam and Christianity in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.|$|E
5000|$|Ibru {{was born}} {{to the family of}} Janet Ibru and Peter Ibru, a missionary worker, who also worked at the Igbobi Orthapaedic Hospital, Lagos. After {{secondary}} school, he joined the United African Company, as a management trainee. In 1956, a few years after joining U.A.C, he dropped out of the company and started a partnership, which he called Laibru. The corporate entity was in partnership with an expatriate, Jimmy Large. After engaging in general trading with some success, in 1957, Michael Ibru discovered that the frozen fish market was a fertile market with the potential to deliver returns above the market rate. However, it was a tough market to penetrate, at the time, many expatriate firms and Nigerian traders were lacking and some were not interested in the market. But he felt he could put extra effort communicating with <b>general</b> <b>traders,</b> who played key roles in products acceptance. To trade in seafood, he established an importing company, he also rented and built cold storage facilities across the country. By the mid-1960s trading fish had become the traditional money maker for the Ibru organization. Though he had other profitable interests such as transportation and construction, fish trading helped him secure financing and other forms of capital to engage in large scale trading. He established a partnership with a Taiwanese company, Osadjere Fishing Company, which provided Trawlers and other accessories for trading. By the end of the 1960s he branched out fully into other areas of the economy. Like a lot of his contemporaries, he established a transportation company, called Rutam. He also invested in palm oil production. Over the years, the Ibru Organization has expanded into other areas such as Tourism, Brewery, Timber and Poultry.|$|E

40|$|Most {{financial}} markets allow investors to submit both limit and market orders, {{but it is}} not always clear what affects the choice of order type. The authors empirically investigate how the time between order submissions, changes {{in the state of the}} order book, and price uncertainty influence the rate of submission of limit and market orders. The authors measure the expected time (duration) between the submissions of orders of each type using an asymmetric autoregressive conditional duration model. They find that the execution of market orders, as well as changes in the level of price uncertainty and market depth, impact the submissions of both best limit orders and market orders. After correcting for these factors, the authors also find differences in behaviour around market openings, closings, and unexpected events that may be related to changes in information flows at these times. In <b>general,</b> <b>traders</b> use more market (limit) orders at times when execution risk for limit orders is highest or the risk of unexpected price movements is highest.

The aim of the firm was to create a worldwide telegraph company, initially by connecting England, Russia and Scandinavia by means of undersea cables. By holding the monopoly on submarine cables connecting Scandinavia with Great Britain to the west and Russia to the east, it managed to build up a telegraph system stretching from Great Britain to Japan, China and the Far East in just a few years.|$|R

We add a trader who has an additional quadratic preference regarding the price, and we make ordinary traders uncertain about this manipulator’s target price.

60|$|Under these {{successive}} arrangements things took {{a course}} {{very different from}} their usual order. A new disposition took place, not dreamt of in the theories of speculative politicians, and of which few examples in the least resembling it have {{been seen in the}} modern world, none at all in the ancient. In other instances, a political body that acts as a commonwealth was first settled, and trade followed {{as a consequence of the}} protection obtained by political power; but here the course of affairs was reversed. The constitution of the Company began in commerce and ended in empire. Indeed, wherever the sovereign powers of peace and war are given, there wants but time and circumstance to make these powers supersede every other. The affairs of commerce will fall at last into their proper rank and situation. However primary in their original intention, they will become secondary. The possession, therefore, and the power of assertion of these great authorities coinciding with the improved state of Europe, with the improved state of arts in Europe, with the improved state of laws, and, what is much more material, the improved state of military discipline, more and more perfected every day with us,--universal improvement in Europe coinciding with the general decay of Asia, (for the proud day of Asia is passed,) this improvement coinciding with the relaxation and dissolution of the Mogul government, with the decline of its warlike spirit, with the total disuse of the ancient strictness of the military discipline established by Tamerlane, the India Company came to be what it is, a great empire, carrying on, subordinately, a great commerce; it became that thing which was supposed by the Roman law irreconcilable to reason and propriety,--eundem negotiatorem et dominum: the same power became the <b>general</b> <b>trader,</b> the same power became the supreme lord.|$|R

40|$|Journal {{writer was}} a dental surgeon and conchologist. Records of {{historic}} and cultural information regarding {{most of the}} major island empires, kingdoms, sultanates, and protectorates within the greater Pacific Basin. This book-length log of Dr. Rabe’s cruise and sojourn in the Carolines, principally at Yap, is one of three such volumes which are scarcely excelled in the annals of such works of laymen because of the richness of detail and the infinite variety of folk customs which he observed and carefully recorded. The Doctor had struck up a warm camaraderie with the famous trader Captain D. D. O’Keefe in Manila. O’Keefe invited him to accompany him as a non-passage-paying guest aboard the Schooner “Jenny” bound for Yap. It flew the flag of the U. S. and was of 48 tons registry (but 100 tons gross). Captain O’Keffe was a <b>general</b> <b>trader</b> in the Caroline Islands. He was the sole owner of the St. David's Group near the Dutch New Guinea Coast. Writing to his brother Dr. Benjamin Rabe (letter dated April 3, 1892, at O’Keffe’s canteen on Yap), Doctor John Rabe said that even then O’Keefe was a name to conjure with in the islands of the South Pacific. He had at that date spent twenty years in Micronesia. In 1892 O'Keefe owned an island in the Yap Group and a small archipelago in the Carolines and three fine trading schooners. On Yap he owned and operated the mint, a quarry, where he kept six Yap natives busy cutting out the massive stone rings used there for money. This log book has one of Captain O’Keefe’s own charts placed inside the front cover and one placed inside the back cover, and signed by O’Keffe.

40|$|We {{proposed}} the agent-based model of financial markets where agents (or traders) {{are represented by}} three-state spins located on the plane lattice or social network. The spin variable represents only the individual opinion (advice) that each trader gives to his nearest neighbors. In the model the agents {{can be considered as}} cunning. For instance, although agent having currently a maximal value of the spin advises his nearest neighbors to buy some stocks he, perfidiously, will sell some stocks in the next Monte Carlo step or will occupy a neutral position. In <b>general,</b> the <b>trader</b> has three possibilities: he can buy some stocks if his opinion change within a single time step is positive, sell some stocks if this change is negative, or remain inactive if his opinion is unchanged.
