5|$|It is poetic {{justice that}} a {{helicopter}} {{is now at}} the heart of the Government's embarrassment and in the centre of their dilemma. Indeed, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to blame the prison officer who observed that he thought it was the Minister for Defence paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday because, of course, we all know the Minister for Defence is wont to use helicopters, as somebody observed already, as other Ministers are wont to use State cars.|$|E
5|$|It {{was found}} that the A-43 turret was very tight for two crewmembers; it had {{insufficient}} observation field; there was no turret ventilation, which made continuous gunfire difficult; and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to rotate the turret manually. At the beginning of 1933, a new 76mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 with reduced (from 900mm to 500mm) recoil length was installed into the A-43 turret. The turret was still a very tight place for crew members. The ammunition stowage for 54 rounds was unsuccessful, and the military refused the A-43 turret.|$|E

5|$|On Victoria Day, 24 May 1881, the {{stern-wheeler}} ferry SS Victoria capsized in the Thames River {{close to}} Cove Bridge in West London. Approximately 200 passengers {{drowned in the}} shallow river, {{making it one of}} the worst disasters in London's history, and is now dubbed 'The Victoria Day Disaster'. At the time, London's population was relativity low, therefore <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to find a person in the city who did not have a family member affected by the tragedy.|$|E
5|$|On that night, Lee maneuvered {{the small}} craft {{out to the}} anchorage. It took two hours to reach his destination, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> work {{manipulating}} the hand-operated controls and foot pedals to propel the submersible into position. Adding to his difficulties was a fairly strong current and the darkness creeping overhead, which made visibility difficult.|$|E
5|$|ReTool {{bought and}} sold used tools. Winmark opened the first ReTool on November 10, 1999, in Chicago. Roughly 65% of ReTool's goods were {{purchased}} from people, while the remainder was purchased from factories that produced too many tools or from closing businesses. CEO John Morgan said in an October 2000 interview that many people did not sell tools they did not use so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to accumulate used tools at ReTool. Winmark sold ReTool around 2002.|$|E

5|$|Richard Nixon's jowly, beard-shadowed face, the {{ski-jump}} {{nose and}} the widow's peak, the arms upstretched in the V-sign, {{had been so}} often pictured and caricatured, his presence had become such a familiar one in the land, {{he had been so}} often in the heat of controversy, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to realize the nation really would not 'have Nixon to kick around anymore'.|$|E
5|$|According to {{consolidated}} {{figures the}} episode was watched by 3.28 million viewers on its BBC two debut, aggregated to 4.74 million viewers after {{taking into consideration}} two repeat broadcasts the same week. Reviews of the episode ranged from mostly negative to very positive. Most commentators praised the larger role of Rhys in the episode, the performance of actor Kai Owen and the realism of the acting and dialogue overall. However, {{a large proportion of}} reviewers criticised the special effects used to create the alien and it was subsequently compared by some to resembling a sock puppet or hand puppet. Whilst some reviewers identified with the plight of the alien, others felt that its poor realisation meant that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to feel any sympathy for it.|$|E
5|$|In the January 2003 general {{election}}, the LPF shrank to 5.7% {{support and}} eight seats. Following the election the LPF was exchanged for the Democrats 66 {{in the government}} coalition, and would {{find it hard to}} maintain support in opposition. Besides Joost Eerdmans, most of its Members of Parliament were not very visible, while party leader Herben had enough work just keeping the party from further infighting. The party also went into financial straits, and as the new coalition continued most of the former coalition's policies, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> for the LPF to oppose the government.|$|E
50|$|The {{drawbacks}} to the garda hitch <b>are</b> that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> {{to release}} under load, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to inspect, and it adds {{a lot of}} friction to a pulley system.

5|$|The {{miniature}} Enterprise {{was again}} {{used for the}} spacewalk sequence. Even on the large model, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to make the miniature appear realistic in extreme close-up shots. To make the pullback shot work, the camera had to be within one-eighth of an inch from the model. Painter Kim Smith spent several days on a tiny area of the model to add enough surface detail for the close-up, but even then the focus was barely adequate. To compensate, the crew used a wider-angle lens and shot at the highest f-stop they could. The live-action scenes of the spacewalking crew were then digitally added. Wide shots used footage of photo doubles walking across a large bluescreen draped across ILM's parking lot at night.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no blood}} on her feet or other debris, such as the sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on her hands and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The {{blood on her}} nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to see how she could have carried the cartridges.|$|E
5|$|Unusually {{for winter}} sports, {{bobsleigh}} {{has never been}} popular in Norway. The country had not sent an Olympic team until the 1948 Winter Olympics {{and there were no}} previous bobsleigh tracks in Norway when Oslo was awarded the 1952 Winter Olympics. Two Swiss civil engineers, Heinz Cattani and Emil Ingold, were the main technical consultants {{for the development of the}} venue. The steep terrain made construction excessively expensive, resulting in the organizing committee deciding to build a temporary track, without permanent concrete and stone curves. Instead, a new track was constructed each year using snow: the overhangs were built by hand, the tracks were leveled and the structure sprayed with ice until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard.</b>|$|E

5|$|With Twitter, it wasn't {{clear what}} it was. They {{called it a}} social network, they called it microblogging, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to define, because it didn't replace anything. There was this path of {{discovery}} with something like that, where over time you {{figure out what it}} is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.|$|E
5|$|Helmichis' coup {{ultimately}} {{failed because}} it met strong {{opposition from the}} many Lombards who wanted to continue {{the war against the}} Byzantines and to confront the regicides. Faced with the prospect of going to war at overwhelming odds, Helmichis asked for help from the Byzantines. The praetorian prefect Longinus enabled him to avoid a land route possibly held by hostile forces, by shipping him instead down the Po to Byzantine-held Ravenna, together with his wife, his Lombard and Gepid troops, the royal treasure and Albsuinda. Bognetti believes that Longinus may have planned to make the Lombards weaker by depriving them of any legitimate heir. In addition, because of the ongoing war, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to assemble all the warriors to elect a new king formally. This plan was brought to nothing by the troops stationed in Ticinum, who elected their duke Cleph king, having it in mind to continue Alboin's aggressive policy. In contrast, Wolfram argues that Cleph was elected in Ticinum while Helmichis was still making his bid for the crown in Verona.|$|E
5|$|Late on October23, Alpha made {{landfall}} in Hispaniola, quickly decreasing {{in intensity}} {{as it did}} so. After making landfall, the storm weakened, leaving it just between tropical storm and tropical depression status. Because of the weakening, and the strong southerly flow from nearby Hurricane Wilma, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> {{to determine whether a}} low-level circulation was present. However, satellite imagery suggested that a new center had developed over open waters to the north of Hispaniola. It was downgraded to a tropical depression early the next day, now re-emerging over open waters. The storm soon developed an elongated center of circulation which indicated that the system was weakening. On October24 the low-level center had completely dissolved, and only a small area of convective activity persisted. Thus the system had dissipated, and was a remnant low pressure system when the National Hurricane Center issued their last advisories of Alpha. Shortly thereafter, the remnant low was absorbed into the circulation of Hurricane Wilma on October25.|$|E

5|$|The local batsmen {{were unable}} to cope with Lindwalls high pace and swing; 43 of his wickets came after his {{opponent}} had missed the ball and been bowled. Lindwall scored 411 runs at 24.17 with two fifties in the first-class matches, including 191 at 31.83 in the Tests. Lindwall had limited batting opportunities, usually playing from No. 7 to No. 9. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> for Lindwall to get any higher up the order as Australia's other frontline bowlers, such as Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, all scored centuries and more than 20 fifties each during their first-class career, and were of similar batting ability. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions due to their batting strength, Lindwall only had 20 innings in his 22 matches, and usually batted at Nos. 7, 8 and 9.N- However, he was often effective when he did get an opportunity.|$|E
