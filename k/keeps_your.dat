500|$|Describing [...] "Lay You Down" [...] {{as one of}} {{the more}} sensual songs on Versus, Mark Nero of About.com wrote [...] "the best of which might be the piano-laced 'Lay You Down,' on which Usher sings: 'This ain't bump 'n grind, I'll show you what love is if you let me lay you down. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe commended Usher's use of falsetto, whilst writing that the song [...] "is an urgent boudoir jam that draws a neat line"– she also commented on how it takes {{inspiration}} from both Prince and Marvin Gaye. Los Angeles Timess Jeff Weiss also pointed out the influence from pop musician Prince, and how Usher is [...] "unctuously cooing about wanting to be the: one who <b>keeps</b> <b>your</b> body warm." [...] "Lay You Down" [...] entered the R/Hip-Hop Songs chart on the week ending November 13, 2010, and peaked at number fifty-six, due to strong radio play.|$|E
500|$|Initial {{reviews of}} the film were {{thoroughly}} mixed. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote, [...] "There is not an abundance of subtlety or the lately familiar Hitchcock bent toward significant and colorful scenery in this obviously low-budget job." [...] Crowther called the [...] "slow buildups to sudden shocks" [...] reliably melodramatic but contested Hitchcock's psychological points, reminiscent of Krafft-Ebing's studies, as less effective. While the film did not conclude satisfactorily for the critic, he commended the cast's performances as [...] "fair". British critic C. A. Lejeune was so offended that she not only walked out before the end but permanently resigned her post as film critic for The Observer. Other negative reviews stated, [...] "a blot on an honorable career", [...] "plainly a gimmick movie", and [...] "merely one of those television shows padded out to two hours." [...] Positive reviews stated, [...] "Anthony Perkins' performance {{is the best of}} his career... Janet Leigh has never been better", [...] "played out beautifully", and [...] "first American movie since Touch of Evil to stand in the same creative rank as the great European films." [...] A good example of the mix is the New York Herald Tribunes review, which stated, [...] "...rather difficult to be amused at the forms insanity may take... <b>keeps</b> <b>your</b> attention like a snake-charmer." ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{suspension}} {{is created}} [...] "simply, by denying the listener any I chords," [...] Pallett explains. After {{the first few}} lines, the B tonic chord that repeats throughout the song is offset by bass notes that give it a more dominant 7th feel. [...] "The I chord will never appear again," [...] he observes. At the same time, however, Perry begins singing the melody on that note, and returns to it frequently, even when it clashes with the dominant V chord as she sings [...] "feel like I'm living a". [...] "he vocal melody establishes the key so clearly {{that there is no}} doubt ... Her voice is the sun and the song is in orbit around it," [...] he concludes. [...] "The insistence of the tonic in the melody <b>keeps</b> <b>your</b> ears’ eyes fixed on the destination, but the song never arrives there. Weightlessness is achieved. Great work, songwriters!" [...] Pallett notes other classic pop songs, such as Fleetwood Mac's [...] "Dreams" [...] and Coldplay's [...] "Viva La Vida", that employ the same device.|$|E

"Impecuniosity will do you good," [...] Pen's friend said, {{knocking}} out the ashes {{at the end}} of the narration; [...] "I don't know anything more wholesome for a man--for an honest man, mind you--for another, the medicine loses its effect--than a state of tick. It is an alterative and a tonic; it <b>keeps</b> <b>your</b> moral man in a perpetual state of excitement: as a man who is riding at a fence, or has his opponent's single-stick before him, is forced to look his obstacle steadily in the face, and braces himself to repulse or overcome it; a little necessity brings out your pluck if you have any, and nerves you to grapple with fortune. You will discover what a number of things you can do without when you have no money to buy them. You won't want new gloves and varnished boots, eau de Cologne and cabs to ride in. You have been bred up as a molly-coddle, Pen, and spoilt by the women. A single man who has health and brains, and can't find a livelihood in the world, doesn't deserve to stay there.

[...] I grant that poetry's a crying sin; It brought (no doubt) the excise and army in: Catched like the plague, or love, the Lord knows how, But that the cure is starving, all allow. Yet like the Papist's, is the poet's state, Poor and disarmed, and hardly worth your hate! Here a lean bard, whose wit could never give Himself a dinner, makes an actor live: The thief condemned, in law already dead, So prompts, and saves a rogue who cannot read. Thus, as the pipes of some carved organ move, The gilded puppets dance and mount above. Heaved by the breath the inspiring bellows blow: The inspiring bellows lie and pant below. [...] One sings the fair; but songs no longer move; No rat is rhymed to death, nor maid to love: In love's, in nature's spite, the siege they hold, And scorn the flesh, the devil, and all but gold. [...] These write to lords, some mean reward to get, As needy beggars sing at doors for meat. Those write because all write, and so have still Excuse for writing, and for writing ill. [...] Wretched, indeed! but far more wretched yet Is he who makes his meal on others' wit: 'Tis changed, no doubt, {{from what it was}} before; His rank digestion makes it wit no more: Sense, past through him, no longer is the same; For food digested takes another name. [...] I pass o'er all those confessors and martyrs Who live like S-tt-n, or who die like Chartres, Out-cant old Esdras, or out-drink his heir, Out-usure Jews, or Irishmen out-swear; Wicked as pages, who in early years Act sins which Prisca's confessor scarce hears. Even those I pardon, for whose sinful sake Schoolmen new tenements in hell must make; Of whose strange crimes no canonist can tell In what Commandment's large contents they dwell. [...] One, one man only breeds my just offence; Whom crimes gave wealth, and wealth gave impudence: Time brings all natural events to pass, And made him an attorney of an ass. No young divine, new beneficed, can be More pert, more proud, more positive than he. What further could I wish the fop to do, But turn a wit, and scribble verses too; Pierce the soft labyrinth of a lady's ear With rhymes of this per cent. and that per year? Or court a wife, spread out his wily parts, Like nets or lime-twigs, for rich widows' hearts; Call himself barrister to every wench, And woo in language of the pleas and bench? Language, which Boreas might to Auster hold More rough than forty Germans when they scold. [...] Cursed be the wretch, so venal and so vain: Paltry and proud, as drabs in Drury Lane.

Well, I could wish, that still in lordly domes Some beasts were killed, though not whole hecatombs; That both extremes were banished from their walls, Carthusian fasts, and fulsome bacchanals; And all mankind might that just mean observe, In which none e'er could surfeit, none could starve.
