40|$|In South Africa, the {{invasion}} of riparian forests by alien trees {{has the potential to}} affect the country's limited water resources. Tree water-use measurements have therefore become an important component of recent hydrological studies. It is difficult for South African government initiatives, such as the Working for Water (WfW) alien clearing program, to justify alien tree removal and implement rehabilitation unless hydrological benefits are known. Consequently, water use within a riparian forest along the Buffeljags River in the Western Cape of South Africa was monitored over a 3 -year period. The site consisted of an <b>indigenous</b> <b>stand</b> of Western Cape afrotemperate forest adjacent to a large stand of introduced Acacia mearnsii. The heat ratio method of the heat pulse velocity sap flow technique was used to measure the sap flow of a selection of indigenous species in the <b>indigenous</b> <b>stand,</b> a selection of A. mearnsii trees in the alien stand and two clusters of indigenous species within the alien stand. The indigenous trees in the alien stand at Buffeljags River showed significant intraspecific differences in the daily sap flow rates varying from 15 to 32  L day − 1 in summer (sap flow being directly proportional to tree size). In winter (June), this was reduced to only 7  L day − 1 when limited energy was available to drive the transpiration process. The water use in the A. mearnsii trees showed peaks in transpiration during the months of March 2012, September 2012 and February 2013. These periods had high average temperatures, rainfall and high daily vapor pressure deficits (VPDs – average of 1. 26  kPa). The average daily sap flow ranged from 25 to 35  L in summer and approximately 10  L in the winter. The combined accumulated daily sap flow per year for the three Vepris lanceolata and three A. mearnsii trees was 5700 and 9200  L, respectively, clearly demonstrating the higher water use of the introduced Acacia trees during the winter months. After spatially upscaling the findings, it was concluded that, annually, the alien stand used nearly 6  times more water per unit area than the <b>indigenous</b> <b>stand</b> (585  mm a − 1 compared to 101  mm a − 1). This finding indicates {{that there would be a}} gain in groundwater recharge and/or streamflow if the alien species are removed from riparian forests and rehabilitated back to their natural state...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the delineation of provenance regions for the <b>indigenous</b> <b>stands</b> of Pinus caribaea Morelet var. hondurensis Barr. and Golf. and Pinus oocarpa Schiede within the, Republic of Honduras. The regions have been deduced primarily from environmental data such as topography, rainfall, temperature, soils, vegetation, and human activities, and a 1 so from genetic data on pines in general, and those {{resulting from the}} C. F. I., Oxford, provenance studies, such as the international provenance trials, genotype-environment interaction studies, morphological and biochemical studies. Primary division of the regions {{has been based on}} the distribution of the species, which is controlled principally by topography (altitude) and soils. P. caribaea tends to be confined to valleys and coastal plains, and P. oocarpa to the higher mountainous areas. Further division has taken into account other environmental factors such as rainfall, temperature and human activities, and also genetic data. The final boundaries closely follow geographic zones. Clinal variation, due mainly to environmental conditions that vary with altitude, has been taken into account by specifying limits to altitudinal and areal extent of each seed collection. Delineation has been carried out to facilitate inclusion of other species in the future, and so that boundary modifications can be made as fuller data become availab 1 e.

This paper deals with the influence of harvesting activities on the root system in forest stands. In primary stands and in stands with known harvest intensity, samples of root systems were collected. The total weight of dry basis and mainly their layering within the soil profile were assessed. The collected roots were divided into three classes: class I – ≤ 1. 0 [*]mm, class II 1. 1 – 5. 0 [*]mm, class III – over 5. 0 [*]mm in the diameter.
