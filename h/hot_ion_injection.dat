40|$|Using a year's {{worth of}} {{geosynchronous}} spacecraft data, the substorm associated {{behavior of the}} thermal plasma in the plasma sheet in relation to energetic particle injections is reviewed. Five classes of injection events were found: <b>ion</b> <b>injections</b> without accompanying electron injection at 21 local time (LT); <b>ion</b> <b>injection</b> followed {{a few minutes later}} by an electron injection at 22 LT; simultaneous <b>ion</b> and electron <b>injection</b> close to midnight; electron injections followed by an <b>ion</b> <b>injection</b> at 01 LT; and pure electron injections at 02 LT. The thermal electrons show a significant increase in temperature and pressure at substorm onset, while the density and thermal ion signatures are typically weak. Energetic ions are found to contribute to the total ion pressure and temperature. Preexisting perpendicular anisotropies in the thermal electrons and ions are reduced during the substorm growth phase, but are re-enhanced after onset...|$|R

Past simulations of the weak double layer (WDL) have only included magnetospheric hot electrons and ionospheric cold ions. We simulated {{the formation of the}} WDL numerically and more realistically using a one dimensional electrostatic code. We modeled magnetospheric hot electrons, ionospheric cold <b>ions</b> and <b>hot</b> ionospheric beam <b>ions</b> in the system. The existence of the <b>hot</b> <b>ion</b> beam modifies the characteristics of the WDL, its magnitude of the potential drop and lifetime. We investigated the variation in the character of the WDL for different fractions of the <b>hot</b> <b>ion</b> beam component. The magnitude of the potential jump of the WDL was found to decrease but the lifetime of the WDL increase as this proportion increased. The existence of a critical value of the ratio of the <b>hot</b> beam <b>ions</b> to the cold ions, above which electrons cannot be accelerated effectively and which places an upper limit on the altitude of auroral particle acceleration region has also been shown.|$|R

During this period the CRRES geostationary transfer orbit provided good coverage for all local times from 18 : 00 to 02 : 00, with magnetic latitudes and L-Shells in the ranges +/- 30 degrees and 4 to 8 R-E respectively, Dispersionless <b>ion</b> <b>injections</b> are associated with substorm expansion phase onset. Each injection event has been classified in terms of composition (solar wind or ionospheric rich) and prevailing magnetospheric conditions (represented by Dst). The resulting database (after correction for spacecraft sampling effects) has been used to investigate the observed spatial distribution of the events as a function of composition and Dst. These preliminary investigations illustrate the large spatial extent of dispersionless <b>ion</b> <b>injections</b> (with O+ dominating at earlier MLT) and the sharp (Dst independent) cut off of the MLT distributions at local midnight. We suggest that this corresponds to the 'average' eastern extent of the <b>ion</b> <b>injection</b> region. Furthermore, we suggest that substorms can inject particles into the ring current.

40|$|Abstract. Three {{models for}} the magnetosphere-ionosphere {{coupling}} feedback instability are considered. The ®rst model is based on demagnetization of <b>hot</b> <b>ions</b> in the plasma sheet. The instability {{takes place in the}} global magnetosphere-ionosphere system when magnetospheric electrons drift through a spatial gradient of <b>hot</b> magnetospheric <b>ion</b> population. Such a situation exists on the inner and outer edges of the plasma sheet where relatively cold magnetospheric electrons move earthward through a radial gradient of <b>hot</b> <b>ions.</b> This leads to the formation of ®eld-aligned currents.

40|$|The {{low-energy}} {{neutral atom}} (LENA) imager on the IMAGE spacecraft can detect energetic neutral atoms produced by <b>ion</b> <b>injection</b> into the cusp through a charge exchange with the Earth's hydrogen exosphere. We examined {{the occurrence of}} the LENA cusp signal during positive IMF B(sub z) {{in terms of the}} arrival direction and the IMF clock angle theta(sub CA). Results of statistical analyses show that the occurrence frequency is high on the postnoon side when theta(sub CA) is between approximately 20 degrees and approximately 50 degrees. This is ascribed to <b>ion</b> <b>injection</b> caused by cusp reconnection typical of positive IMF B(sub z). Our results also show that there is another situation of high occurrence frequency, which can be identified with theta(sub CA) of approximately 30 degrees to approximately 80 degrees. When theta(sub CA) is relatively large (60 degrees - 80 degrees), occurrence frequencies are high at relatively low latitudes over a wide extent spanning both prenoon and postnoon sectors. This feature suggests that the <b>ion</b> <b>injection</b> is caused by reconnection at the dayside magnetopause. Its postnoon side boundary shifts toward the prenoon as theta(sub CA) decreases. When theta(sub CA) is less than approximately 50 degrees, the high occurrence frequency exists well inside the prenoon sector, which is azimuthally separated from the postnoon region ascribed to cusp reconnection. The prenoon region, which is thought due to <b>ion</b> <b>injection</b> caused by dayside reconnection, may explain the recent report that proton aurora brightening occurs in the unanticipated prenoon sector of the northern high-latitude ionosphere for IMF B(sub y) greater than 0 and B(sub z) greater than 0...|$|R

40|$|AbstractQuadrupole {{ion trap}} {{scanning}} parameters for performing bottom-up proteomics in a data-dependent fashion were evaluated on a Finnigan LCQ Deca mass spectrometer. Evaluation of parameters {{such as the}} number of averaged full scans, the number of averaged MS/MS scans, and <b>ion</b> <b>injection</b> times were necessary for acquiring high quality MS/MS spectra that yield favorable b and y ion coverage and high correlation to proteins using database searching algorithms. In this study, we demonstrated how the duty cycle of the mass spectrometer affects the number of peptides that can be successfully identified by SEQUEST using a model system of tryptic BSA peptides to mimic a typical complex mixture associated with bottom-up proteomics. The number of averaged scans and the duration of ion accumulation in the trap had a significant effect on the quality of acquired MS/MS spectra. For example, by increasing the <b>ion</b> <b>injection</b> time from 500 ms to 600 ms, peptide HLVDEPQNLIK improved from being improperly identified to being correctly identified with a SEQUEST cross-correlation score of 3. 60.

40|$|To make a High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) {{transmission}} {{more energy}} efficient, the voltage {{of the system}} has to be increased. To allow for that {{the components of the}} system must be constructed to handle the increases AC and DC stresses that this leads to. One key component in such a transmission is the HVDC converter transformer. The insulation system of the transformer usually consists of oil and oil-impregnated pressboard. Modeling of the electric DC field in the insulation system is currently done with the ion drift diffusion model, which takes into account the transport and generation of charges in the oil and the pressboard. The model is however lacking a description of how charges are being injected from the electrodes and the oil-pressboard interfaces. The task of this thesis work was to develop and implement a model for this which improves the result of the ion drift diffusion model. A theoretical study of <b>ion</b> <b>injection</b> was first carried out and proceeding from this, a model for the <b>ion</b> <b>injection</b> was formulated. By using experimental data from 5 different test geometries, the injection model could be validated and appropriate parameter values of the model could be determined. By using COMSOL Multiphysics®, the ion drift diffusion model with the injection model could be simulated for the different test geometries. The <b>ion</b> <b>injection</b> gave a substantial improvement of the ion drift diffusion model.

Finally it is recommended that the investigation of the <b>ion</b> <b>injection</b> continues in order to further improve the model and more accurately determine the parameters of it.
