5|$|During {{the civil}} war and the ensuing Soviet war in Afghanistan, most of the country's {{infrastructure}} was destroyed. Normal patterns of economic activity were disrupted. The Gross national product (GNP) fell substantially during Karmal's rule because of the conflict; trade and transport was disrupted with loss of labor and capital. In 1981 the Afghan GDP stood at 154.3 billion Afghan afghanis, a drop from 159.7 billion in 1978. GNP per capita decreased from 7,370 in 1978 to 6,852 in 1981. The dominant form of economic activity was in the agricultural sector. Agriculture accounted for 63 {{percent of gross domestic product}} (<b>GDP)</b> <b>in</b> 1981; 56 percent of the labor force was working in agriculture in 1982. Industry accounted for 21 percent of <b>GDP</b> <b>in</b> 1982, and employed 10 percent of the labor force. All industrial enterprises were government-owned. The service sector, the smallest of the three, accounted for 10 percent of <b>GDP</b> <b>in</b> 1981, and employed an estimated one-third of the labour force. The balance of payments, which had grown in the pre-communist administration of Muhammad Daoud Khan, decreased, turning negative by 1982 at 70.3 million $US. The only economic activity which grew substantially during Karmal's rule was export and import.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{survey the}} {{clinical}} endodontic protocols of general dental practitioners (<b>GDPs)</b> <b>in</b> public dental clinics {{and to assess}} the effect of an educational intervention on {{the adoption of a}} nickel-titanium (Ni-Ti) rotary system. METHODS: General dental practitioners in a Swedish Intervention County (IC), underwent an educational programme in endodontics. A follow-up questionnaire was posted to 98 <b>GDPs</b> <b>in</b> the IC and to 97 <b>GDPs</b> <b>in</b> a Control County (CC), where no specific training had been provided. The questionnaire concerned demographics, clinical endodontic protocols and instrumentation techniques. RESULTS: The response rate to the questionnaire was 87 %. More than 90 % of all GDPs reported they always or generally used rubber dam, determined working length, used the canal irrigant 0. 5 % buffered NaOCl and calcium hydroxide as an interappointment dressing. Two of three GDPs reported, they generally or always informed the patient of the prognosis. Every second GDP reported routines for postoperative recall and follow-up. The Ni-Ti rotary technique was reported to be completely adopted by 77 % of the <b>GDPs</b> <b>in</b> the IC, significantly higher than in the CC (6 %), P < 0. 001. In the IC 79 % of the GDPs reported they completed instrumentation in one treatment session, compared with only 32 % in the CC, P < 0. 001. The 'single-cone' mode of canal filling was reported to be significantly more frequent amongst <b>GDPs</b> <b>in</b> the IC, P < 0. 001. CONCLUSIONS: General dental practitioners in both counties reported using contemporary clinical endodontic protocols.

40|$|PURPOSE: Glucose {{degradation}} products (GDPs) are precursors of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that cause cellular damage and inflammation. We examined {{the content of}} <b>GDPs</b> <b>in</b> commercially available glucose-containing infusion fluids and investigated whether <b>GDPs</b> are found <b>in</b> patients' blood. METHODS: The content of <b>GDPs</b> was examined <b>in</b> infusion fluids by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. To investigate whether GDPs also are found in patients, we included 11 patients who received glucose fluids (standard group) during and after their surgery and 11 control patients receiving buffered saline (control group). Blood samples were analyzed for GDP content and carboxymethyllysine (CML), {{as a measure of}} AGE formation. The influence of heat-sterilized fluids on cell viability and cell function upon infection was investigated. RESULTS: All investigated fluids contained high concentrations of GDPs, such as 3 -deoxyglucosone (3 -DG). Serum concentration of 3 -DG increased rapidly by a factor of eight in patients receiving standard therapy. Serum CML levels increased significantly and showed linear correlation with the amount of infused 3 -DG. There was no increase in serum 3 -DG or CML concentrations in the control group. The concentration of <b>GDPs</b> <b>in</b> most of the tested fluids damaged neutrophils, reducing their cytokine secretion, and inhibited microbial killing. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that normal standard fluid therapy involves unwanted infusion of GDPs. Reduction of the content of <b>GDPs</b> <b>in</b> commonly used infusion fluids may improve cell function, and possibly also organ function, in intensive-care patients...|$|R

Materials and methods. This was a cross-sectional, descriptive, analytical study that included 150 GDPs. All practitioners were given a self-administered questionnaire which consisted of three parts as-sessing their knowledge of cardiac diseases requiring prophylaxis, dental procedures requiring prophy-laxis, and antibiotic regimen for endocarditis prophylaxis. Statistical analysis of data was carried out using independent t-test, one-way ANOVA and chi-square test. Results. The level of knowledge among <b>GDPs</b> <b>in</b> three areas of cardiac diseases requiring prophylaxis, dental procedures requiring prophylaxis, and antibiotic regimen for endocarditis prophylaxis were 63. 7 %, 66. 8 % and 47. 7 %, respectively.
