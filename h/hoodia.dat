25|$|In 2008 {{after having}} {{invested}} €20 million in R on <b>hoodia</b> {{as a potential}} ingredient in dietary supplements for weight loss, Unilever terminated the project because their clinical studies did not show that <b>hoodia</b> was safe and effective enough to bring to market.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hoodia,</b> a {{succulent}} plant, originates {{from the}} Kalahari Desert of South Africa. For generations {{it has been}} known to the traditionally living San people as an appetite suppressant. In 1996 South Africa’s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research began working with companies, including Unilever, to develop dietary supplements based on <b>hoodia.</b> Originally the San people were not scheduled to receive any benefits from the commercialization of their traditional knowledge, but in 2003 the South African San Council made an agreement with CSIR in which they would receive from 6 to 8% of the revenue from the sale of <b>Hoodia</b> products.|$|E
25|$|In the {{succulent}} greenhouse {{a variety}} of succulents and other xerophytes can be found with most species indigenous to Southern Africa and Madagascar. Some of the interesting plants on display include Myrothamnus flabellifolius (resurrection plant), Didierea madagascariensis (octopus tree), Adansonia digitata (baobab), Fockea edulis (kambro), <b>Hoodia</b> gordonii (ghaap), Aloidendron dichotomum (quiver tree), Sceletium tortuosum (kougoed), Welwitschia mirabilis, Frithia humilis (fairy elephant's feet) and Euphorbia louwii (named after dr. Wynand Louw). Some locally threatened plants such as Nananthus vittatus, (bushveld vygie), Aloe peglerae (red hot poker aloe), Euphorbia knobelii, Euphorbia perangusta and Lithops lesliei (living stones) are also on display.|$|E

50|$|The media {{coverage}} and heavy marketing by nutritional supplement companies that followed those reports have created such {{a demand for}} <b>Hoodia</b> spp. plants that a protected status was imposed in several countries, such as Namibia. Many products claiming to contain <b>Hoodia</b> spp. do not actually contain the active ingredient alleged to suppress appetite. An ongoing review of <b>hoodia</b> pills by Alkemists Pharmaceuticals found {{at least half of}} the products advertised as containing <b>hoodia</b> contained none.|$|E
50|$|Between March and June 2006, {{millions}} of e-mail spam and forum messages were sent out concerning <b>hoodia,</b> ostensibly offering <b>hoodia</b> extracts for weight control purposes. The Federal Trade Commission has logged numerous complaints of consumer fraud associated with <b>hoodia</b> {{and the number}} {{is expected to continue}} to rise.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hoodia</b> gordonii is a {{succulent}} {{native to}} Africa {{which is currently}} under investigation for use as an appetite suppressant. However, {{it has not been}} conclusively demonstrated that <b>Hoodia</b> works as an appetite suppressant in humans. No published, peer-reviewed, double-blind clinical trials have been performed on humans to investigate the safety or effectiveness of <b>Hoodia</b> gordonii in pill form as a nutritional supplement. In addition to <b>Hoodia,</b> TrimSpa X32 tablets contain green tea, glucomannan, cocoa extract, vanadium, and glucosamine. According to the manufacturer's labeling, TrimSpa X32 pills are to be taken a minimum of 3 times and a maximum of 6 times per day. [...] TrimSpa X32 also contains chromium. [...] The stimulant components are <b>hoodia</b> gordonii and components containing caffeine (green tea and cocoa extracts).|$|E
50|$|Several of the small-flowered {{species of}} <b>Hoodia</b> were {{formerly}} {{in a separate}} genus, Trichocaulon ("ghaap"), but have been moved into the <b>Hoodia</b> genus and the two groups are now synonymous. Phylogenetic studies have shown the <b>Hoodia</b> genus to be monophyletic, and most {{closely related to the}} Lavrania genus of stapeliads. Marginally more distantly related is a sister branch of related genera including Larryleachia, Richtersveldia and Notechidnopsis.|$|E

50|$|Many <b>Hoodia</b> {{species are}} {{protected}} plants. <b>Hoodia</b> is currently listed in Appendix II to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which includes species not currently considered endangered but {{are at risk}} if trade is not controlled.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hoodia</b> are stem succulents, {{described}} as [...] "cactiform" [...] {{because of their}} remarkable similarity to the unrelated cactus family.

5000|$|No {{published}} {{scientific evidence}} indicates <b>hoodia</b> is an appetite suppressant in humans.

5000|$|<b>Hoodia</b> gordonii, {{also known}} as Bushman's hat, is a {{leafless}} spiny succulent plant with medicinal properties. It grows naturally in Botswana, South Africa and Namibia. The species became internationally known and threatened by collectors, after a marketing campaign falsely claiming {{that it was an}} appetite suppressant for weight loss. [...] The flowers smell like rotten meat and are pollinated mainly by flies. The indigenous San people (Bushmen) of the Namib desert call this plant ǁhoba (pronounced [...] - the initial sound is a lateral click) - and the Afrikaans name ghaap is used to refer to all species of <b>Hoodia.</b> <b>Hoodia</b> gordonii was discovered and painted by Col. Robert Jacob Gordon {{in the vicinity of the}} Orange River in about 1779, and identified as a Stapelia, a closely related genus.|$|E
50|$|As of 2007, four {{independent}} labs {{are conducting}} tests to verify H. gordonii in consumer products. They are: Advanced Laboratories, Inc. in Smithfield, North Carolina, Alkemist Pharmaceuticals, Chromadex Labs of Irvine, California, and the University of Mississippi. The American Herbal Products Association completed work in 2009 establishing {{the de facto}} industry standard for authentication in response to scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission of the <b>hoodia</b> industry and complaints by consumers of fraudulent <b>hoodia</b> products being marketed.|$|E
