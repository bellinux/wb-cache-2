5|$|Although lithium {{is widely}} {{distributed}} on Earth, {{it does not}} naturally occur in elemental form due to its <b>high</b> <b>reactivity.</b> The total lithium content of seawater is very large and is estimated as 230 billion tonnes, where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm), or 25 micromolar; higher concentrations approaching 7 ppm are found near hydrothermal vents.|$|E
5|$|The alkali metals, due {{to their}} <b>high</b> <b>reactivity,</b> do not occur {{naturally}} in pure form in nature. They are lithophiles and therefore remain close to the Earth's surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica, forming relatively low-density minerals that do not sink down into the Earth's core. Potassium, rubidium and caesium are also incompatible elements {{due to their}} large ionic radii.|$|E
5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the zircon is converted to the metal, which finds various niche applications. Because of zirconium's excellent resistance to corrosion, it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments, and watch cases. The <b>high</b> <b>reactivity</b> of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as getters in vacuum tubes. The same property is (probably) the purpose of including Zr nano-particles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb.|$|E
25|$|For {{catalytic}} hydroboration, Pinacol pinacolborane and catecholborane {{are widely}} used. They also demonstrate <b>higher</b> <b>reactivity</b> toward alkynes.|$|R
40|$|Serum {{samples were}} {{collected}} from 27 individuals who had been infected {{with a member of}} the genus Hantavirus in the Netherlands or Belgium during the last 15 years. These samples were tested in an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) systems, using different virus strains that represented each of the four recently proposed serotypes of this genus. The serum samples from 11 individuals who had been infected through contacts with laboratory rats showed the <b>highest</b> <b>reactivities</b> with Hantaan virus (serotype I) and SR- 11 (serotype II) in the IFA and ELISA systems. The samples of 16 individuals who had probably been infected through contacts with wild rodents showed the <b>highest</b> <b>reactivities</b> with Hallnas virus (serotype III) in the IFA. All except two of these also showed the <b>highest</b> <b>reactivity</b> with Hallnas virus in the two different ELISA systems...|$|R
40|$|The electrocatalytic {{reduction}} of nitrate has been studied with electrochemical methods on palladium and palladium–platinum electrodes activated with germanium. The formation of a palladium–germanium alloy that occurs at germanium coverage above 0. 2 has a strong enhancing effect on the rate of nitrate reduction, whereas the reaction rate is low for germanium coverage below 0. 2. Palladium electrodes covered with a submonolayer platinum are effectively activated by a low germanium coverage. Cyclic voltammetry of adsorbed NO shows that the <b>higher</b> <b>reactivity</b> of palladium–platinum electrodes in the nitrate reduction {{is related to the}} <b>higher</b> <b>reactivity</b> of platinum towards NO reduction as compared to palladium. ...|$|R
5|$|Because of the <b>high</b> <b>reactivity</b> of the metal, {{toxicological}} {{data are available}} only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are all shiny, soft, highly {{reactive}} metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge +1. They {{can all be}} cut easily with a knife due to their softness, exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen (and {{in the case of}} lithium, nitrogen). Because of their <b>high</b> <b>reactivity,</b> they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air, and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free elements. Caesium, the fifth alkali metal, is the most reactive of all the metals. In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, the alkali metals comprise the group 1 elements, excluding hydrogen (H), which is nominally a group 1 element but not normally considered to be an alkali metal as it rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to that of the alkali metals. All the alkali metals react with water, with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.|$|E
25|$|This {{instability}} {{correlates with}} its <b>high</b> <b>reactivity,</b> explaining {{the ease of}} its ring-opening reactions (see Chemical properties).|$|E
50|$|As {{the organic}} tin {{compound}}, a trimethylstannyl or tributylstannyl compound is normally used. Although trimethylstannyl compounds show <b>higher</b> <b>reactivity</b> compared with tributylstannyl compounds and have much simpler 1H-NMR spectra, the toxicity {{of the former}} is much larger.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, Meyers {{reported}} the first alkylation reaction of metallated azaenolates of hydrazones with an acyclic amino acid-based auxiliary. Compared {{with the free}} carbonyl compounds and the chiral enamine species reported previously, the hydrazones exhibit <b>higher</b> <b>reactivity,</b> regioselectivity and stereoselectivity.|$|R
30|$|Lignosulfonate can be {{also used}} to produce lignin-containing PF resins. Alonso et al. [13] {{evaluated}} the reactivity of various lignosulfonates towards formaldehyde. Softwood lignosulfonates exhibited <b>higher</b> <b>reactivity</b> towards formaldehyde than hardwood lignosulfonates, and softwood ammonium lignosulfonate showed the <b>highest</b> <b>reactivity.</b> Peng et al. studied the kinetics of lignin hydroxymethylation. They reported that lignosulfonates could be hydroxymethylated at a lower temperature than phenol owing to the lower activation energy of lignosulfonates [84]. Ultra-filtrated high molecular weight lignosulfonate (LS) {{can be used to}} manufacture insulation boards based on mineral wool, as it forms an adhesive when combined with phenol resin [85]. Notably, LS/PF resins with compositions ranging from 10 / 90 to 30 / 70 have appropriate technical and commercial properties.|$|R
25|$|The <b>high</b> <b>reactivity</b> {{comes in}} part from the partial {{isomerisation}} of the NH2OH structure to ammonia oxide (also known as azane oxide), with structure NH3+O−.|$|E
25|$|Like phenols, aniline {{derivatives}} {{are highly}} susceptible to electrophilic substitution reactions. Its <b>high</b> <b>reactivity</b> reflects {{that it is}} an enamine, which enhances the electron-donating ability of the ring. For example, reaction of aniline with sulfuric acid at 180°C produces sulfanilic acid, H2NC6H4SO3H.|$|E
25|$|<b>High</b> <b>reactivity</b> Metakaolin (HRM): Metakaolin {{produces}} concrete with {{strength and}} durability similar to concrete made with silica fume. While silica fume is usually dark gray or black in color, high-reactivity metakaolin is usually bright white in color, {{making it the}} preferred choice for architectural concrete where appearance is important.|$|E
50|$|Zinc has showed much <b>higher</b> <b>reactivity</b> toward {{pentachlorophenol}} than iron. This {{indicates that}} zinc {{may be used}} as a replacement for ZVI in dechlorinating chlorinated phenols. Chlorinated phenols are sequentially dechlorinated and thus less chlorinated phenols have been identified as a reduction product.|$|R

25|$|Traces of many {{aldehydes}} {{are found}} in essential oils and often contribute to their favorable odors, e.g. cinnamaldehyde, cilantro, and vanillin. Possibly because of the <b>high</b> <b>reactivity</b> of the formyl group, aldehydes are not common {{in several of the}} natural building blocks: amino acids, nucleic acids, lipids. Most sugars, however, are derivatives of aldehydes. These aldoses exist as hemiacetals, a sort of masked form of the parent aldehyde. For example, in aqueous solution {{only a tiny fraction of}} glucose exists as the aldehyde.|$|E
25|$|Because of the <b>high</b> <b>reactivity</b> of ozone, {{only a few}} {{materials}} may be used like {{stainless steel}} (quality 316L), titanium, aluminium (as long as no moisture is present), glass, polytetrafluorethylene, or polyvinylidene fluoride. Viton may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). Hypalon may be used with the restriction that no water {{come in contact with}} it, except for normal atmospheric levels. Embrittlement or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone. Ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like O-rings.|$|E
500|$|Because of the <b>high</b> <b>reactivity,</b> {{samples of}} solid {{europium}} rarely have the shiny {{appearance of the}} fresh metal, even when coated with a protective layer of mineral oil. Europium ignites in air at 150 to 180°C to form europium(III) oxide: ...|$|E
50|$|Slow {{addition}} of preformed hydrazones to potassium tert-butoxide in DMSO as reaction medium instead of glycols allows hydrocarbon formation {{to be conducted}} successfully at temperatures as low as 23 °C. Cram attributed the <b>higher</b> <b>reactivity</b> in DMSO as solvent to higher base strength of potassium tert-butoxide in this medium.|$|R
5000|$|The heteropolyhalogen cations are explosively {{reactive}} oxidants, and the cations {{often have}} <b>higher</b> <b>reactivity</b> than their parent interhalogens and decompose by reductive pathways.

40|$|Reactivity of Aluminum Clusters {{has been}} found to exhibit size {{sensitive}} variations. This work is motivated by a recent report 1 predicting <b>higher</b> <b>reactivity</b> of melted Aluminum clusters towards the N 2 molecule as compared to the non-melted Al clusters. We attempt to understand the underlying electronic and structural factors influencing the adsorption of N 2 molecule (a prerequisite for the reactivity) on ground state geometry (a non-melted structure) of various Al clusters. The results show that the adsorption energy is of the order of 8 - 10 kcal/mol and does not vary with respect to the cluster size and the electronic properties of the ground state geometry. The structural and electronic properties of high energy conformations of Al clusters (a melted cluster) are also analyzed to explain their <b>higher</b> <b>reactivity</b> towards N 2 molecule...|$|R
500|$|Titanium {{is one of}} the few {{elements}} that burns in pure nitrogen gas, reacting at [...] to form titanium nitride, which causes embrittlement. Because of its <b>high</b> <b>reactivity</b> with oxygen, nitrogen, and some other gases, titanium filaments are applied in titanium sublimation pumps as scavengers for these gases. Such pumps inexpensively and reliably produce extremely low pressures in ultra-high vacuum systems.|$|E
500|$|The {{bond energy}} of difluorine {{is much lower}} than that of either [...] or [...] and similar to the easily cleaved {{peroxide}} bond; this, along with high electronegativity, accounts for fluorine's easy dissociation, <b>high</b> <b>reactivity,</b> and strong bonds to non-fluorine atoms. Conversely, bonds to other atoms are very strong because of fluorine's high electronegativity. Unreactive substances like powdered steel, glass fragments, and asbestos fibers react quickly with cold fluorine gas; wood and water spontaneously combust under a fluorine jet.|$|E
500|$|The Earth's crust {{contains}} 2.27% sodium, {{making it}} the seventh most abundant element on Earth and the fifth most abundant metal, behind aluminium, iron, calcium, and magnesium and ahead of potassium. Sodium's estimated oceanic abundance is 1.08 milligrams per liter. Because of its <b>high</b> <b>reactivity,</b> it is never found as a pure element. It is found in many different minerals, some very soluble, such as halite and natron, others much less soluble, such as amphibole and zeolite. [...] The insolubility of certain sodium minerals such as cryolite and feldspar arises from their polymeric anions, which {{in the case of}} feldspar is a polysilicate.|$|E

5000|$|Angle strain destabilizes a molecule, as {{manifested}} in <b>higher</b> <b>reactivity</b> and elevated heat of combustion. Maximum bond strength results from effective overlap of atomic orbitals in a chemical bond. A quantitative measure for angle strain is strain energy. Angle strain and torsional strain combine to create ring strain that affects cyclic molecules.|$|R
500|$|Elemental {{potassium}} {{does not}} occur in nature because of its <b>high</b> <b>reactivity.</b> It reacts violently with water (see section Precautions below) and also reacts with oxygen. Orthoclase (potassium feldspar) is a common rock-forming mineral. Granite for example contains 5% potassium, which is well above the average in the Earth's crust. Sylvite (KCl), carnallite , kainite [...] and langbeinite [...] are the minerals found in large evaporite deposits worldwide. The deposits often show layers starting with the least soluble {{at the bottom and}} the most soluble on top. Deposits of niter (potassium nitrate) are formed by decomposition of organic material in contact with atmosphere, mostly in caves; because of the good water solubility of niter the formation of larger deposits requires special environmental conditions.|$|E
500|$|The name {{derives from}} Latin calx [...] "lime", which was {{obtained}} from heating limestone. Its compounds were known to the ancients, though their chemistry was unknown until the seventeenth century. It was isolated by Humphry Davy in 1808 via electrolysis of its oxide, who named the element. While the pure metal does not have many applications due to its <b>high</b> <b>reactivity,</b> it is often used as an alloying component in small quantities in steelmaking, and calcium–lead alloys are sometimes used in automotive batteries. Calcium compounds {{on the other hand}} are very widely used in many industries: for example, they are used in foods and pharmaceuticals for calcium supplementation, in the paper industry as bleaches, in cement, in the manufacture of soaps, and as electrical insulators.|$|E
