5|$|Khan {{began his}} career with {{appearances}} in several television series in the late 1980s. He made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with Deewana. Early in his career, Khan was recognised for portraying villainous roles in the films Darr (1993), Baazigar (1993) and Anjaam (1994). He then rose to prominence after starring {{in a series of}} romantic films, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Mohabbatein (2000) and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an alcoholic in Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist in Swades (2004), a hockey coach in Chak De! India (2007) and a man with Asperger syndrome <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Name</b> Is Khan (2010). His highest-grossing films include the comedies Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year (2014). Many of his films display themes of Indian national identity and connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances. For his contributions to film, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri, and the Government of France awarded him both the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and the Légion d'honneur.|$|E

25|$|Systems of {{government}} are dynamic {{and they are}} bound to change {{in accordance with the}} wishes of and aspirations of the people...During my term of office, I selflessly dedicated myself to the good cause of Mother Malawi in the fight against Poverty, Ignorance and Disease among many other issues; but if within the process, those who worked in my government or through false pretence <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>name</b> or indeed unknowingly by me, pain and suffering was caused to anybody in this country in the name of nationhood, I offer my sincere apologies. I also appeal for a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness amongst us all...Our beautiful country has been nicknamed `The Warm Heart of Africa' and we have been admired for our warmth and spirit of hardwork. This admiration calls not only for a need for us to look at our past and present and draw lessons from it, but there is even a greater need for us to look forward to the future in our endeavours to reconstruct and reconcile if we have to move forward at all.|$|E
25|$|A {{prayer of}} {{petition}} is {{a request to}} God that asks him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression {{is not intended to}} instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for the things we need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, but to give definite form to our desires, to concentrate our whole attention on what we have to recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an Act of Faith in that the one praying must believe first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The Catechism states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, should be the first movement of a prayer of petition. Jesus said to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever you ask the Father <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>name</b> he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one can ask for God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the Catechism, Christ is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name.|$|E

500|$|The themes {{encompassing}} African-American writer Maya Angelou's seven autobiographies include racism, identity, family, and travel.

500|$|Gather Together <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Name</b> {{was not as}} {{critically}} acclaimed as Angelou's first autobiography, but received mostly positive reviews and was recognized as better written. [...] Atlantic Monthly's reviewer said that the book was [...] "excellently written". and Choice Magazine called Angelou a [...] "fine story teller". [...] Cudjoe calls the book [...] "neither politically nor linguistically innocent". Although Cudjoe finds Gather Together a weaker autobiography compared to Caged Bird, he states that Angelou's use of language is [...] "the work's saving grace", and that it contains [...] "a much more consistent and sustained flow of eloquent and honey-dipped writing".|$|E
500|$|Gather Together <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Name</b> (1974) is {{a memoir}} by American writer and poet Maya Angelou. It {{is the second}} book in Angelou's series of seven autobiographies. [...] The book begins {{immediately}} following the events described in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, and follows Angelou, called Rita, from the ages of 17 to 19. Written three years after Caged Bird, the book [...] "depicts a single mother's slide down the social ladder into poverty and crime." [...] The {{title of the book}} is taken from the Bible, but it also conveys how one black female lived in the white-dominated society of the U.S. following the Second World War.|$|E
500|$|The opening movement, [...] "" [...] (Behold, I {{will send}} out many fishers), {{is given to}} the bass solo, {{possibly}} because Jeremiah has God speak in the first person.

Some cantatas on texts by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler from the second annual cycle begin in a similar way with a bible quotation, of Jesus saying [...] "" [...] (I am a Good Shepherd, BWV 85), [...] "" [...] (It is good for you that I leave, BWV 108), and Jesus saying [...] "" [...] (Until now you have asked for nothing <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>name,</b> BWV 87).|$|E

500|$|Als calls Angelou {{one of the}} [...] "pioneers of self-exposure", {{willing to}} focus {{honestly}} on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices. For example, while Angelou was composing her second autobiography, Gather Together <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Name,</b> she was concerned about how her readers would react to her disclosure {{that she had been}} a prostitute. Her husband Paul Du Feu talked her into publishing the book by encouraging her to [...] "tell the truth as a writer" [...] and [...] "be honest about it". Through the writing of her life stories, however, Angelou has become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women. It made her, as scholar Joanne Braxton stated, [...] "without a doubt...America's most visible black woman autobiographer".|$|E
500|$|The gospel quotation, [...] "Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch, so ihr den Vater etwas bitten werdet in meinem Namen, so wird er's euch geben. [...] " [...] (Truly, truly I say to you, {{whatever}} you ask of the Father <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>name,</b> so {{will it be}} given to you.), {{is given to the}} bass as the vox Christi, the voice of Jesus. The instruments, strings probably doubled by oboe d'amore, introduce vocal motifs which the voice picks up. The bass sings the text three times, while the instruments continue playing the same motifs. Julian Mincham observes: [...] "The richness of the text, the unobtrusive nature of the melodic ideas and the gently flowing rhythms combine to create an appropriate atmosphere of dignified restraint".|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} Gather Together is {{inspired}} by Matthew 18:19-20: [...] "Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>name,</b> there am I {{in the midst of}} them" [...] (King James version). While Angelou acknowledged the title's biblical origin, she also stated that the title counteracted the tendency of many adults to lie to their children about their pasts. Scholar Sondra O'Neale states that the title is [...] "a New Testament injunction for the traveling soul to pray and commune while waiting patiently for deliverance".|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{send for}} me when you're <b>in</b> need-- <b>My</b> <b>name</b> is BROWN--your life I've saved it." [...] "My rival!" [...] shrieked the invalid, And drew a mighty sword and waved it: ...|$|R

500|$|In Angelou's {{first two}} volumes, {{the setting is}} limited to three places (Arkansas, Missouri, and California), while in Singin' and Swingin, the [...] "setting breaks open" [...] to include Europe as she travels with the Porgy and Bess company. Lupton states that Angelou's travel narrative, which takes up {{approximately}} 40 percent of the book, gives the book its organized structure, especially compared to Gather Together <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Name,</b> which is more chaotic. Angelou's observations about race, gender, and class serve to make the book {{more than a simple}} travel narrative. As a Black American, her travels around the world put her in contact with many nationalities and classes, expand her experiences beyond her familiar circle of community and family, and complicate her understandings of race relations.|$|E

500|$|Angelou's autobiographies, {{especially}} the first volume, {{have been used}} in narrative and multicultural approaches to teacher education. Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at George Washington University, has used Caged Bird and Gather Together <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Name</b> when training teachers to appropriately explore racism in their classrooms. Angelou's use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony causes readers of Angelou's autobiographies to wonder what she [...] "left out" [...] and to be unsure how to respond to the events Angelou describes. These techniques force white readers to explore their feelings about race and their privileged status in society. Glazier found that although critics have focused on where Angelou fits within the genre of African-American autobiography and her literary techniques, readers react to her storytelling with [...] "surprise, particularly when [...] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography".|$|E
