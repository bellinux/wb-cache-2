In particular, the dependences of the PID varactors' performance (i. e. tunability and quality factor) {{on the physical}} design parameters, such as <b>finger</b> <b>spacing</b> and width, are investigated. It was found that both the capacitance and tunability of the PID varactors show strong dependence upon the <b>finger</b> <b>spacing.</b> This dependence {{can be divided into}} the linear part (when the <b>finger</b> <b>spacing</b> is large) and non-linear part (when the <b>finger</b> <b>spacing</b> is small). The finger width also affects the capacitance and tunability, although to a much lesser degree. The relations between the physical design parameters and the varactors' performance provide useful scaling information for accurate and optimized varactor design. The relation between the quality-factor (Q-factor) and the bias voltage is also revealed and explained using an equivalent circuit model. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An {{overview}} of recent results on high-speed germanium-on-silicon-on-insulator (Ge-on-SOI) photodetectors and their prospects for integrated optical interconnect applica-tions are presented. The optical properties of Ge and SiGe alloys are described and {{a review of}} previous research on SOI and SiGe detectors is provided as a motivation for the Ge-on-SOI detector approach. The photodetector design is described, which consists of lateral alternating p- and n-type surface contacts on an epitaxial Ge absorbing layer grown on an ultrathin-SOI substrate. When oper-ated at a bias voltage of − 0. 5 V, 10 µm × 10 µm devices have dark current Idark, of only ∼ 10 nA, a value that is nearly independent of <b>finger</b> <b>spacing</b> S, between S = 0. 3 µm and 1. 3 µm. Detectors with S = 1. 3 µm have external quantum efficiencies η, of 52 % (38 %) at λ = 895 nm (850 nm) with corresponding responsiv-ities of 0. 38 A/W (0. 26 A/W). The wavelength-dependence of η agrees fairly well with expectations, except at longer wavelengths, where Si up-diffusion into the Ge absorbing layer reduces the effi-ciency. Detectors with 10 µm × 10 µm area and S = 0. 6 µm have − 3 -dB bandwidths as high as 29 GHz, and can simultaneously achieve a bandwidth of 27 GHz with Idark = 24 nA, at a bias of only − 1 V, while maintaining high efficiency of η = 46 %(33 %), at λ = 895 nm (850 nm). Analysis of the <b>finger</b> <b>spacing</b> and area-dependence of the device speed indicates that the performance at large <b>finger</b> <b>spacing</b> is transit-time-limited, while at small <b>finger</b> <b>spacing,</b> RC delays limit the bandwidth. Methods to improve the device performance are presented, and it is shown that significant improvement in the speed and efficiency both at λ = 850 and 1300 nm can be expected by optimizing the layer structure design.

40|$|We {{show that}} a topological phase {{supporting}} Majorana fermions can form in a 2 D electron gas (2 DEG) adjacent to an interdigitated superconductor-ferromagnet structure. An advantage of this setup is that the 2 DEG can induce the required Zeeman splitting and superconductivity from a single interface, allowing one to utilize a wide class of 2 DEGs including the surface states of bulk InAs. We demonstrate that the interdigitated device supports a robust topological phase when the <b>finger</b> <b>spacing</b> lambda is smaller {{than half of the}} Fermi wavelength lambda_F. In this regime, the electrons effectively see a "smeared" Zeeman splitting and pairing field despite the interdigitation. The topological phase survives even in the opposite limit lambda>lambda_F/ 2, though with a reduced bulk gap.

40|$|The {{design of}} a triple {{junction}} solar cell’s front contact grid can significantly affect cell conversion efficiency under high concentration. We consider one aspect of grid design, choosing a linear grid within a distributed resistance cell model to optimize finger spacings at concentrations between 500 and 2500 suns under uniform and nonuniform illumination. Optimization for maximum efficiency under Gaussian irradiance profiles is done by SPICE analysis. Relative to the optimized uniform illumination designs, we find enhancements of 0. 5 % to 2 % in absolute efficiencies for uniform spacing. Efficiency enhancement with nonuniform spacing under nonuniform illumination is also evaluated. Our model suggests that, at lower concentrations (< 1000 suns), the penalty for using uniformly <b>spaced</b> <b>fingers</b> instead of nonuniformly <b>spaced</b> <b>fingers</b> is < 0. 1 %. However, at a concentration of 2500 suns the penalty increases to 0. 3 %.
