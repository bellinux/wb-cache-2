5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, is the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons.

The fragmentation of the Great Comet of 1882 itself demonstrated that this was plausible. It is now thought that the Great Comet of 1882 is a fragment of X/1106 C1, and that Comet du Toit (C/1945 X1) and Comet Ikeya–Seki (C/1965 S1) are two of its sister fragments.|$|E
