5|$|The Cycle Center is {{designed}} to encourage bicycle commuting to Millennium and Grant Parks {{as well as to}} work and other nearby downtown locations, such as the Art Institute of Chicago. It represents two major initiatives by the mayor: to promote cycling and to make the city greener. By supporting cycling as an alternate form of transportation, it will help reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality and promote the <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> cycling.|$|E

5|$|The cooking of {{the area}} {{is not to be}} {{confused}} with the Mediterranean diet, made popular because of the apparent <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> a diet rich in olive oil, wheat and other grains, fruits, vegetables, and a certain amount of seafood, but low in meat and dairy products. Mediterranean cuisine encompasses the ways that these and other ingredients, including meat, are dealt with in the kitchen, whether they are health-giving or not.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Infectious {{microbes}} can {{be transmitted}} through the drinking water supply. Recent research indicates that infection transmission dynamics influence the public <b>health</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> water treatment interventions, although some risk assessments currently in use do not fully account for those dynamics. This chapter models the public <b>health</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> two interventions: improvements to centralized water treatment facilities, and localized point-of-use treatments {{in the homes of}} particularly susceptible individuals. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the best option is not as obvious as that suggested by an analysis that ignores infection dynamics suggests. Deterministic and stochastic dynamic systems models prove to be useful tools for assessing the dynamics of risk exposure...|$|R

5|$|The war {{of words}} would {{continue}} for another 130 years with endless commentary from doctors, poets, playwrights and authors all arguing for their favorite region and their polemics being reproduced in advertisements for Burgundy and Champagne. On a few occasions, the two regions were {{on the brink of}} civil war. A turning point occurred when several Champagne wine makers abandoned efforts to produce red wine in favor of focusing on harnessing the effervescent nature of sparkling Champagne. As the bubbles became more popular, doctors throughout France and Europe commented on the <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> the sparkling bubbles which were said to cure malaria. As more Champenois winemakers embarked on this new and completely different wine style, the rivalry with Burgundy mellowed and eventually waned.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of 2004, Fletcher {{proposed}} changes to the <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> state workers and retirees. Fletcher's plan provided discounts for members who engaged in healthier behavior, which he called a transition from a sickness initiative to a wellness initiative. Acknowledging that out-of-pocket expenses would rise, Fletcher proposed a 1% salary increase to offset the additional costs. State employees, particularly public school teachers, broadly opposed Fletcher's plan, and the Kentucky Educators Association called for an indefinite strike, to begin October 27, 2004. To address the opposition, Fletcher called a special session of the legislature to begin October 5, 2004. Although the state was still operating under an executive spending plan, Fletcher did not include the budget or his tax reform proposal in the session's agenda, a move praised by both parties, allowing them to focus only on concerns over the health plan. In a fifteen-day session, the General Assembly passed a plan that allocated $190 million more to health insurance for state workers and restored many of the most popular benefits in the previous insurance plan. Immediately after the session adjourned, the Kentucky Educators Association voted to cancel their proposed strike.|$|E

25|$|In red wine, up to 90% of the wine's {{phenolic}} content {{falls under}} the classification of flavonoids. These phenols, mainly derived from the stems, seeds and skins are often leached out of the grape during the maceration period of winemaking. The amount of phenols leached is known as extraction. These compounds contribute to the astringency, color and mouthfeel of the wine. In white wines the number of flavonoids is reduced due to the lesser contact with the skins that they receive during winemaking. There is on-going study into the <b>health</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> wine derived from the antioxidant and chemopreventive properties of flavonoids.|$|E
