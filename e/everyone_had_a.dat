500|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series creator Rob Thomas, marking his seventh writing credit and second and final directing credit for the series (after [...] "Donut Run"). Starting with this episode, Thomas and the crew's plan for the season changed—while they had initially scheduled three major story arcs for the season, this number was now bumped down to two, while the last few episodes would be standalone. The creative team decided that their choices for major mysteries had not worked since season one; Thomas elaborated, [...] "One feeling is that the big mysteries keep away the casual TV viewers, and the other is the thing that has been the least successful since season one [...] the big mysteries." [...] Thomas also recalled that his major design for the first season that was because Lilly had been murdered, <b>everyone</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> stake in the solving of the mystery and that the crew were finding it impossible to keep the same amount of emotional involvement since the first season; Thomas thought that the new format would be a way of trying to return to a more emotionally driven format.|$|E

Lennertz attempted to remain [...] "authentic" [...] to the characters' progression from average worker to calculated killer. To achieve this aim, he decided against recording digitally, instead recording the tracks on two-inch analog tape, intending each musical cue to {{sound as if}} it was emanating from a vinyl record. He explained, [...] "The idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they would make an album. It isn't over-produced or shiny and digital in any way. It's brash, noisy, and full of bravado and swagger. I knew that if we could harness some of this sonic magic in the score, then the toughness and confidence of the music would play against Bateman, Sudeikis, and Charlie Day to really emphasize and elevate the humor in the situations that transpire." [...] Lennertz continued, [...] "We tracked through tape before Pro Tools to get that fat sound, and made every choice based on feel rather than perfection. We even used the same Wurlitzer that Money Mark played on Beck's classic ‘Where It's At’. At the end of the day, Seth [...] and I wanted to produce a score that is as irreverent and full of attitude as the movie itself. I think we did it...and most of all, <b>everyone</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> blast in the process." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{this was}} opposed {{by many people}} within the {{environmental}} movement, since the model did not allow for people to change their values to stabilise the world, and they argued that the model tried to maintain and enforce the current political hierarchy. Arthur Tansley who had invented the term ecosystem, had once accused Field Marshal Jan Smuts of the [...] "abuse of vegetational concepts". Smuts had invented a philosophy called holism, where <b>everyone</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> 'rightful place', {{which was to be}} managed by the white race. The 70s protestors claimed that the same conceptual abuse of the supposed natural order was occurring, that it was really being used for political control.|$|E

2500|$|Turner {{was born}} in Brownsville, Brooklyn, before at four his mother moved the family out, anticipating that the {{neighbourhood}} {{was about to turn}} into a ghost town. According to Turner, [...] "You couldn't be seen on the streets after a certain hour, because the place was like the wild, wild West. <b>Everyone</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> gun." [...] Their new home resided in LeFrak City, Queens. Here, Turner grew up and attended John Adams High School, a school renowned for its American football programme. Turner was a wide receiver, until at 15, he figured it might not be the game for him. He turned his attention to basketball heading into his junior year, practising six hours every day during the summer and acquired good dunking skills. However, when he tried out for the school team that fall as a junior, he didn't make it, his coach pointing out to him that there was more to the game than dunking.|$|E
2500|$|While {{contracts}} often determine {{wages and}} terms of employment, the law refuses to enforce contracts {{that do not}} observe basic standards of fairness for employees. Today, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 aims to create a national minimum wage, and a voice at work, especially through collective bargaining should achieve fair wages. A growing body of law also regulates executive pay, although a system of [...] "maximum wage" [...] regulation, for instance by the former Stabilization Act of 1942, is not currently in force. Historically, the law actually suppressed wages, not of the highly paid, by ordinary workers. For example, in 1641 the Massachusetts Bay Colony legislature (dominated by property owners and the official church) required wage reductions, and said rising wages [...] "tende to the ruin of the Churches and the Commonwealth". In the early 20th century, democratic opinion demanded <b>everyone</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> minimum wage, and could bargain for fair wages beyond the minimum. But when states tried to introduce new laws, the US Supreme Court held them unconstitutional. A right to [...] "freedom of contract", argued a majority, could be construed from the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment's protection against being deprived [...] "of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law". Dissenting judges argued that [...] "due process" [...] {{did not affect the}} legislative power to create social or economic rights, because employees [...] "are not upon a full level of equality of choice with their employer".|$|E

But the crowd, he was already beginning to discover, was a crowd still, helpless in the hands of demagogue and organiser, individually cowardly, individually swayed by appetite, collectively incalculable. The memory of countless figures in pale blue canvas came before his mind. Millions of such men and women below him, he knew, had never been out of the city, had never seen beyond the little round of unintelligent grudging participation in the world's business, and unintelligent dissatisfied sharing in its tawdrier pleasures. He thought of the hopes of his vanished contemporaries, and for a moment the dream of London in Morris's quaint old News from Nowhere, and the perfect land of Hudson's beautiful Crystal Age--appeared before him in an atmosphere of infinite loss. He thought of his own hopes.|$|E
