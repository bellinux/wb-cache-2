5|$|In 1962 Green {{joined with}} a group of Republican ward leaders who broke off from the main party, which was led by Sheriff Austin Meehan, to support Governor William Scranton. All of the other ward leaders were voted out of office, and {{although}} Green retained his position Sheriff Meehan told him that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> support his appointment to the bench.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to modern stage races, a cyclist {{who gave up}} during a stage was allowed to start again the next stage, although <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be in contention for the general classification. Thus Hippolyte Aucouturier, who gave up during the first stage, was able to return, and won {{the second and third}} stages. Charles Laeser, winner of the fourth stage, had not completed the third stage.|$|E
5|$|On May 14, Paul's {{campaign}} {{announced that}} {{due to lack of}} funds (though despite financial backing from financiers Peter Thiel and Mark Spitznagel) <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> actively campaign for votes in the 11 remaining primary states, including Texas and California, that had not yet voted. He would, however, continue to seek to win delegates for the national party convention in the states that had already voted.|$|E

50|$|Nietzsche {{believed}} {{there could be}} positive possibilities for humans without God. Relinquishing the belief in God opens the way for human creative abilities to fully develop. The Christian God, <b>he</b> wrote, <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> stand in the way, so human beings might stop turning their eyes toward a supernatural realm and begin to acknowledge {{the value of this}} world.|$|R
5|$|After {{missing the}} first 50 {{games of the}} 2009–10 OHL season, Hodgson {{returned}} to the Battalion line-up on February 4, 2010, recording two assists in a 4–2 win against the Erie Otters. Following his return, he declared <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be training in the off-season with Canucks Director of Player Development Dave Gagner, under whose supervision he suffered his back injury. Combined with the Canucks doctors' initial misdiagnosis and Vigneault's disparaging comments regarding Hodgson following the NHL pre-season, there was speculation in the media of a possible conflict between Hodgson and the Canucks organization. General Manager Mike Gillis, however, dismissed such speculation.|$|E
5|$|In Tondon Tiku began {{preparations}} for his mother's funeral, preparations which, in Torajan culture, took several months. While {{taking care of}} the preparations, he had an advisor collect weapons secretly while another went to his fortresses in Alla' and Ambeso. Tiku then made preparations to escape Dutch custody; he also returned all property that he had taken as a lord, as he knew <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> use it. While in Tondon, Dutch forces may have harassed the Torajan leader. The night before his mother's funeral, in January 1907, Tiku and 300 of his followers escaped Tondon, heading south.|$|E
5|$|Not {{wanting to}} carry two {{championship}} belts, Ted DiBiase returned the Million Dollar Championship to the WWF, telling an executive that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> appear with the belt. Money Inc. defended their tag team title against The Natural Disasters at WrestleMania VIII on April 5 and lost the match by countout. Because titles can only change hands via pinfall or submission, Money Inc. retained the belts. Over {{the next few}} months, the teams faced each other in rematches on television and at house shows, but Money Inc. managed to retain the title.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Coombes {{was sick}} of life. He walked away from his unhappy home, and, sick not only of his own {{existence}} but of everybody else's, turned aside down Gaswork Lane to avoid the town, and, crossing the wooden bridge that goes over the canal to Starling's Cottages, was presently alone in the damp pine woods {{and out of sight}} and sound of human habitation. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> stand it <b>no</b> <b>longer.</b> <b>He</b> repeated aloud with blasphemies unusual to him that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> stand it <b>no</b> <b>longer.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ingraham {{pledged that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> serve <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> than two terms or 10 years as Head of Government.

50|$|After the {{previous}} Ayreon album, Actual Fantasy, sold below expectations, Arjen sought {{to deliver a}} top-quality recording with Into the Electric Castle. If the album {{had not been a}} success, Lucassen said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> continued the Ayreon project. It also remains his highest selling album to date, with The Human Equation being a close second.|$|R
5|$|A point guard, Farmer led Clay County High School to the 1987 Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA) State Basketball Championship and, in 1988, {{was named}} Kentucky Mr. Basketball and Kentucky Associated Press Male High School Athlete of the Year after setting a {{championship}} game record with 51 {{points in a}} losing effort. Although he was popular state-wide and publicly stated his desire to play collegiate basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats, Coach Eddie Sutton was reluctant to offer Farmer a scholarship. After Farmer {{announced that he would}} visit other colleges and issued a deadline past which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> consider Kentucky without a scholarship offer, Sutton relented and Farmer joined the University of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Although Johnson {{had focused}} the {{majority}} of his campaign activities on the New Hampshire primary, he announced on November 29, 2011 that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> campaign there due to his inability to gain traction with less than a month until the primary. There was speculation in the media that he might run as a Libertarian Party candidate instead. Johnson acknowledged that he was considering such a move. In December, Politico reported that Johnson would quit the Republican primaries and announce his intention to seek the Libertarian Party nomination at a December 28 press conference. He also encouraged his supporters to vote for Ron Paul in 2012 Republican presidential primaries.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{remained}} {{for less than}} a year before resigning to take up a five-year appointment in Bombay as Chair of Clinical Tropical Medicine at a newly created School of Tropical Medicine, a post for which he had been nominated by the Royal Society. On arrival in India, he found that the scheme had been abandoned and that as his appointment could be terminated at six-months' notice, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be required after October 1922. Fairley demanded and received an audience with the Governor of Bombay, Sir George Lloyd, the result of which was that the Secretary of State agreed to create a special five-year post of Medical Officer of the Bombay Bacteriological Laboratory and Honorary Consulting Physician to the Sir Jamshedjee Jeejebhoy Hospital and St George Hospital.|$|E
60|$|Master Lionel {{dismissed}} the notion contemptuously. For pretence's sake {{he announced that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> wait <b>no</b> <b>longer,</b> whereupon Nicholas brought in his supper, and left him again to go and linger about the door, looking {{out into the night}} and listening for his master's return. He paid a visit to the stables, and knew that Sir Oliver had gone forth afoot.|$|R
60|$|Weeks counted up to months, {{and still}} he searched on, {{maintaining}} himself by small jobs {{of work in}} the intervals. By this time he had arrived at a seaport, and there he derived intelligence that persons answering somewhat to his description had emigrated a little time before. Then <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> search <b>no</b> <b>longer,</b> and that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go and settle in the district which he had had for some time in his mind.|$|R
50|$|Arriving in London in {{his later}} teens, Young started a solo project and {{performed}} under the stage name Jay Jay Pistolet. As Jay Jay Pistolet, Young released a single 'We Are Free' with Chess Club Records in 2007 and an EP 'Happy Birthday You' in 2008 with Stiff Records, frequently touring {{with the likes of}} Laura Marling, Kid Harpoon, Slow Club and Johnny Flynn. In December 2008, Justin Young announced that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be performing as Jay Jay Pistolet.|$|R
5|$|In 1683, George and his brother, Frederick Augustus, {{served in}} the Great Turkish War at the Battle of Vienna, and Sophia Dorothea bore George a son, George Augustus. The {{following}} year, Frederick Augustus was informed of the adoption of primogeniture, meaning <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> receive part of his father's territory as he had expected. It led to a breach between father and son, and between the brothers, that lasted until Frederick Augustus's death in battle in 1690. With the imminent formation of a single Hanoverian state, and the Hanoverians' continuing contributions to the Empire's wars, Ernest Augustus was made an Elector of the Holy Roman Empire in 1692. George's prospects were now better than ever as the sole heir to his father's electorate and his uncle's duchy.|$|E
5|$|After {{narrowly}} surviving {{a vote of}} {{no confidence}} by 17 votes to 14 {{at a meeting of}} the party's Executive Committee in Glasgow on 16 May 2015, Murphy announced that he would step down as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in June. Stating that he wanted to have a successor in place by the summer, he confirmed that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be standing for a seat in the Scottish Parliament. Before relinquishing the leadership role, Murphy drew up proposals for a number of party reforms, including the adoption of a one-member, one-vote ballot for future leadership contests. His resignation took effect on 13 June after his reforms had been provisionally accepted by Labour's executive committee. A timetable was also set out that would see a new leader elected on 15 August, while Gray was appointed as acting leader. Dugdale and Macintosh stood in the contest to choose Murphy's successor; Dugdale was subsequently elected as Scottish Labour's new leader with a 72% share of the vote. At the same time, Rowley became her deputy.|$|E
5|$|On March 31, 2012, Edge (with {{his usual}} long hair cut short) was {{inducted}} into the WWE Hall of Fame by Christian, during WrestleMania XXVIII weekend. Edge made a surprise appearance on the April 23, 2012 episode of Raw, confronting his long-time rival John Cena about Brock Lesnar. He mentioned that despite sharing the biggest rivalry of their careers, they always shared mutual admiration for professional wrestling. In an act of motivation, he told Cena to 'wake up' and beat Brock Lesnar. He also mentioned beforehand that he was not supposed to be on the show that night, also declaring that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be under contract with WWE in a couple of days. After this, his contract with the WWE had legitimately expired. On the September 21, 2012 episode of SmackDown, Edge made an appearance addressing Team Hell No.|$|E
60|$|They {{waited a}} long time, for the private was {{in no hurry to}} become an {{ornament}} and made his guesses very slowly. The Nome King, who seemed to know, by some magical power, all that took place in his beautiful rooms of his palace, grew impatient finally and declared <b>he</b> <b>would</b> sit up <b>no</b> <b>longer.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On Friday, May 7, Tom Arnold {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> wait <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> for a decision from ABC and was quitting The Jackie Thomas Show {{to develop a}} new sitcom for CBS. Both networks declined to comment. The following Monday, ABC debuted its fall prime-time schedule and officially canceled Jackie Thomas along with nine other shows. [...] "The cancellation was made {{solely on the basis of}} ratings performance in the time period," [...] ABC spokesman Steve Battaglio said. Less than a week later, the Arnolds {{announced that}} ABC Entertainment had signed a multi-series deal, including [...] "on the air commitments," [...] with the couple's production company Wapello County Productions.|$|R
60|$|He got up {{and went}} violently out, leaving Catherine aghast. Was it {{possible}} Roger had sworn? What on earth had come over the b'y? But come what had or come what <b>would,</b> <b>he</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> looked fey--there was that much to be thankful for. Even an occasional oath was better than that. Catherine went stiffly about her dish-washing, resolving to have 'Liza Adams to supper some night.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. He read the news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not {{ready to move on}} to the next news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called him into his office and berated him, telling him he did not deserve to be on television and that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware that he was going to lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1190, Longchamp's {{relations}} with Richard's younger brother John were difficult. This led to Longchamp besieging Lincoln Castle because the castellan would not surrender the castle and {{allow himself to}} be replaced by Longchamp's nominee. The castellan, Gerard de Camville, had sworn allegiance to John and stated <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> recognise the chancellor's authority. In response, John took the two castles of Tickhill and Northampton. News of the dispute reached Richard, who sent Walter de Coutances, the Archbishop of Rouen, to England in late spring 1191, with orders to negotiate a peace between John and Longchamp. Eventually, Walter brokered a compromise between the two as a result of which Gerard was confirmed as castellan and John relinquished the castles. Longchamp also agreed to work to ensure John's succession to the throne in the event of Richard's death.|$|E
5|$|At the {{strategic}} level the general uprising never eventuated, and in late-February the communist offensive collapsed after suffering more than 45,000 killed, against South Vietnamese and allied losses of 6,000 men. Regardless, {{it proved to}} be {{a turning point in the}} war and although it had been a tactical disaster for the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong, Hanoi emerged with a significant political victory as confidence in the American military and political leadership collapsed, as did public support for the war in the United States. Prior to Tet, American commanders and politicians had talked confidently about winning the war, arguing that General William Westmoreland's strategy of attrition had reached the point where the communists were losing soldiers and equipment faster than they could be replaced. Yet the scale of the offensive, and the surprise and violence with which it had been launched, had shocked the American public and contradicted such predictions of imminent victory; in its wake President Lyndon Johnson announced that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> seek a second term in office. Tet had a similar effect on Australian public opinion, and caused growing uncertainty in the government about the determination of the United States to remain militarily involved in Southeast Asia. Amid the initial shock, Prime Minister John Gorton unexpectedly declared that Australia would not increase its military commitment in Vietnam beyond the current level of 8,000 personnel.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2013, Wong's channel, 'freddiew' {{was renamed}} to [...] "Rocketjump", and 'freddiew2' was renamed to [...] "BrandonJLa" [...] Brandon Laatsch also {{announced}} that <b>he</b> and Wong <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> {{work together on}} projects, and any short videos or [...] "shorts" [...] would be posted on either NODE (a gaming channel run by Laatsch, Niko Pueringer, and Sam Gorski) or BrandonJLa.

5|$|In autumn 1940, {{high-ranking}} German officials {{drafted a}} memorandum {{on the dangers}} of an invasion of the Soviet Union. They said Ukraine, Belorussia and the Baltic States would end up as only a further economic burden for Germany. It was argued that the Soviets in their current bureaucratic form were harmless and that the occupation would not benefit Germany. Hitler disagreed with economists about the risks and told his right-hand man Hermann Göring, the chief of the Luftwaffe, that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> listen to misgivings about the economic dangers of a war with Russia. It is speculated that this was passed on to General Georg Thomas, who had produced reports that predicted a net economic drain for Germany {{in the event of an}} invasion of the Soviet Union unless its economy was captured intact and the Caucasus oilfields seized in the first blow, and he consequently revised his future report to fit Hitler's wishes. The Red Army's ineptitude in the Winter War against Finland in 1939–40 convinced Hitler of a quick victory within a few months. Neither Hitler nor the General Staff anticipated a long campaign lasting into the winter, and therefore adequate preparations, such as the distribution of warm clothing and winterization of vehicles and lubricants, were not made.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July, Willaumez sailed again, attacking {{shipping}} at Montserrat, Nevis and St. Kitts before sailing to Tortola {{in preparation}} for {{an attack on the}} Jamaica convoy. Before he could reach the convoy, Willaumez was intercepted off the Passage Islands by a squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane and driven northwards into the Bahamas. There he waited for the Jamaica convoy to pass, seizing any ship of any nationality that came within sight, in case they should reveal his position. After several weeks of waiting, Captain Bonaparte, the Emperor's brother and commander of the ship Vétéran, decided that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> submit to Willaumez's command and sailed north during the night of 31 July, without orders or even notifying the admiral. Vétéran eventually returned to France on 26 August, after destroying six ships from a Quebec convoy. Panicked by the unexplained disappearance of one of his ships and its illustrious captain, Willaumez struck north in search of the vessel and as a result missed the passage of the Jamaica convoy, also narrowly avoiding an encounter with the squadrons under Warren and Strachan. On 18 August a hurricane dispersed his ships, severely damaging them and scattering them along the Atlantic Seaboard of the Americas. One was destroyed by a British patrol, two others were too badly damaged to be repaired and were broken up, and three of his ships successfully made the journey back to France over the next two years.|$|E

He {{decided to sell}} part of his collection to the Peruvian government for 60,000 Soles. They were put on display in 1924 and he was named the museum's first director (with a salary of four Soles per month), but his tenure was short {{because he was in}} poor health, which prompted him to return to Germany for good in 1925. His full collection is now displayed at the Museo Arqueologico Nacional Brüning in Lambayeque, which opened in 1966.|$|R
60|$|It {{was after}} dark {{when he arrived}} home, and he went {{straight}} {{to his room and}} to bed without meeting any one. He sank down between the cool sheets with a sigh of satisfaction at the thought that, come what <b>would,</b> <b>he</b> need <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> worry about his history. Then another and unwelcome thought obtruded itself, and he knew that the next school term would come, and that six months thereafter, another examination in the same history awaited him.|$|R
60|$|But {{they could}} not talk much of the future; and Charles told how he had rested through all his campaigns in the {{knowledge}} that his Anne was watching and praying for him, and how his long illness had brought before him deeper thoughts than he had ever had before, and made him especially dwell on the wrong done to his parents by his long absence, and the lightness with which he had treated home duties and responsibilities, till he had resolved that if his life were then spared, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> neglect them <b>no</b> <b>longer.</b>|$|R
