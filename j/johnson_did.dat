5|$|The {{earliest}} {{report of}} casualties {{came in a}} special message by President Lyndon B. Johnson sent to Congress on January 30, 1967. In the message, the president said 80 people {{had died in the}} smog. <b>Johnson</b> <b>did</b> not cite a source of that claim, and there is no known source concluding that 80 people died, other than those citing Johnson.|$|E
5|$|The son Richard <b>Johnson</b> <b>did</b> {{not begin}} his formal {{education}} until age fifteen, {{since there were}} no schools on the frontier. He entered Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky. While studying law (reading the law) as a legal apprentice with George Nicholas and James Brown by 1799 at the university, where {{his father was a}} trustee, he quickly drawn into politics like his father.|$|E
5|$|As {{publishing}} {{began to}} change its form in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, large publishing houses pushed out small, independent booksellers. <b>Johnson</b> <b>did</b> not attempt to form or join one of these new firms. In the late 1790s and early 19th century, Johnson's business declined, particularly as his relatives, John Miles and Roland Hunter, began {{to take over the}} daily operations; Miles was uninterested in the business, and Hunter did not have Johnson's commercial sense or his ability to choose successful manuscripts. In January 1806, Johnson's premises were wracked by a second fire, destroying the building and all of his stock.|$|E

5|$|Bolt {{turned his}} main {{focus to the}} 200 m and equalled Roy Martin's world junior record of 20.13 s at the Pan-American Junior Championships. This {{performance}} attracted interest from the press, and his times in the 200 m and 400 m led to him being touted as a possible successor to Johnson. Indeed, at sixteen years old, Bolt had reached times that <b>Johnson</b> <b>did</b> not register until he was twenty, and Bolt's 200 m time was superior to Maurice Greene's season's best that year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Johnson</b> <b>did</b> not {{initially}} aspire to play professionally, focusing instead on his communication studies major {{and on his}} desire to become a television commentator. Playing with future NBA draftees Greg Kelser, Jay Vincent and Mike Brkovich, Johnson averaged 17.0points, 7.9rebounds, and 7.4assists per game as a freshman, and led the Spartans to a 25–5record, the Big Ten Conference title, and a berth in the 1978 NCAA Tournament. The Spartans reached the Elite Eight, but lost narrowly to eventual national champion Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|<b>Johnson</b> <b>did</b> {{not make}} any first-team {{appearances}} for Manchester United, but he did feature as an unused substitute in the club's 4–0 win at home to Galatasaray in the Champions League on 7 December 1994. Having failed {{to break into the}} Manchester United first team, he was released {{at the end of his}} contract in June 1995. Now without a club, Johnson was able to sign for Third Division club Bury on a free transfer a few days later. Over the next two years, Johnson scored 18 goals in 97 league appearances as the club secured successive promotions to the First Division.|$|E

50|$|Noteworthy is {{the fact}} that Loverboy keyboardist Doug <b>Johnson</b> <b>does</b> not appear in the song's music video. His absence was intentional, as he felt that the Top Gun film over-glamorized war and {{military}} service.|$|R

5|$|Johnson's {{publications}} {{were rarely}} luxury goods: he priced his merchandise competitively, but always within {{the reach of}} the middle class, the audience he most wanted to serve. One way that he reduced costs was by printing texts in the provinces and then importing them to London; many of Priestley's works, for example, were printed locally in Birmingham. <b>Johnson</b> <b>did</b> not take great care with the printing of many of his books; they are full of errors and poorly bound. But as they were often printed extremely quickly to respond to a particular event, this was expected by his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|The Australian press {{attacked}} the team, {{and called for}} changes, including the omission of the captain, Johnson. Johnson, Miller and Gil Langley were the tour selectors. Langley and Miller were willing to omit Johnson only if the captain volunteered to stand aside. <b>Johnson</b> <b>did</b> not volunteer, so the others did not discuss the topic. Miller and Johnson had both been appointed as Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1956 New Year Honours, and between the Tests they attended their formal investiture.|$|E
5|$|A {{veteran of}} World War I, <b>Johnson</b> <b>did</b> not begin playing {{competitive}} hockey {{until he was}} in his 20s and was nearly 30 when he first broke into the NHL. Regarded as one of the hardest bodycheckers to ever play the game, he was a fan favourite and went on to play 436 games with the Rangers and Americans before spending his final seasons in the minor leagues as a player, coach and official. Johnson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958, and {{is also a member of}} the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum and the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame.|$|E
5000|$|On the future, <b>Johnson</b> <b>does</b> {{not plan}} to retire, as he said, [...] "I like kicking (butt).I like to win, my whole life has been competitive," [...] and he will {{continue}} [...] "until they throw dirt in my face".|$|R

50|$|Johnson {{found that}} he could not knock out the giant Willard, who fought as a counterpuncher, making <b>Johnson</b> <b>do</b> all the leading.

5|$|Although it {{was unusual}} at {{the time for a}} {{national}} candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and <b>Johnson</b> <b>did</b> not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. {{had been}} aware of the PAVN/Viet Cong sanctuaries in Cambodia since 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson had chosen not to attack them due to {{possible}} international repercussions and his belief that Sihanouk could be convinced to alter his policies. <b>Johnson</b> <b>did,</b> however, authorize the reconnaissance teams of the highly classified Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (SOG) to enter Cambodia and gather intelligence on the Base Areas in 1967. The election of Richard M. Nixon in 1968 and the introduction of his policies of gradual U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam and the Vietnamization of the conflict there, changed everything.|$|E
5|$|Dominic Johnson {{participated in}} {{athletics}} as a pole vaulter, {{returning to the}} Olympics for his third time; Johnson had previously participated as a pole vaulter (and, at one time, a relay runner) on behalf of Saint Lucia in the 2000 Summer Olympics and 1996 Summer Olympics. Johnson flew to San Diego days before the competition cutoff and made the qualifying preliminary height for the Olympics shortly after winning a silver medal at the Central American and Caribbean Championships in Cali, Columbia. Johnson's event took place on 20 August 2008. With a height of 5.30 metres, <b>Johnson</b> <b>did</b> not qualify, although he tied for seventeenth place in his qualifying group. As such, he did not advance. Johnson tied with the Czech pole vaulter Štěpán Janáček for thirtieth place overall.|$|E

50|$|<b>Johnson</b> <b>does</b> not {{advocate}} outright {{legalization of}} other drugs. Instead, he believes other drugs {{should be treated}} as a health problem rather than a criminal justice problem. He believes these steps will lessen crime in the United States, help balance the budget, increase the quality of courts and prisons, and protect civil liberties.|$|R
5|$|His {{first major}} work, the poem London, {{contains}} {{an early version}} of Johnson's ethics and morality system. Within the poem, he combined attacks on the politics of Walpole and the British government with the immoral actions of the common Londoner to form a general satire of 18th-century London society. Johnson compares London to the Roman Empire in its decline and blames moral and political corruption for its fall. Although <b>Johnson</b> <b>did</b> not start his literary criticism career until later, London is an example of what Johnson thought poetry should be: it is youthful and joyous, but it also relies on simple language and easy to understand imagery.|$|E
5|$|His {{works on}} Shakespeare were devoted {{not merely to}} Shakespeare, but to {{understanding}} literature as a whole; in his Preface to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous dogma of the classical unities and argues that drama should be faithful to life. However, <b>Johnson</b> <b>did</b> not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeare's faults, including his lack of morality, his vulgarity, his carelessness in crafting plots, and his occasional inattentiveness when choosing words or word order. As well as direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions, each of which contained errors caused by the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors who deemed difficult words incorrect, and changed them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way.|$|E
5|$|In the 1790s, Johnson aligned {{himself with}} the {{supporters}} of the French Revolution, and published {{an increasing number of}} political pamphlets in addition to a prominent journal, the Analytical Review, which offered British reformers a voice in the public sphere. In 1799, he was indicted on charges of seditious libel for publishing a pamphlet by the Unitarian minister Gilbert Wakefield. After spending six months in prison, albeit under relatively comfortable conditions, Johnson published fewer political works. In the last decade of his career, <b>Johnson</b> <b>did</b> not seek out many new writers; however, he remained successful by publishing the collected works of authors such as William Shakespeare.|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 75: Dr. Warton says, [...] "that Johnson {{seems to}} have passed too severe a censure on this episode of Lodona; and that a tale in a {{descriptive}} poem has a good effect." [...] <b>Johnson</b> <b>does</b> not object to a tale in a descriptive poem. He objects only to the triteness of such a tale as this.--BOWLES.] ...|$|R
5000|$|Under the {{existing}} tax system, <b>Johnson</b> <b>does</b> not support taxing internet sales. He says, [...] "The Internet has flourished and society has benefited immeasurably {{because it has}} remained relatively free of taxation. The moratorium on access and service taxation must be made permanent." [...] However, he supports the FairTax system, which he acknowledged would apply to internet sales.|$|R
50|$|About his work, {{the poet}} Bruce Smith has said:Because Peter <b>Johnson</b> <b>does</b> not guide himself {{either by the}} turns and counterturns of verse or the {{horizontal}} urge of prose, he must continually reinvent the wheel and its destination. He writes with a lover's lavish extravagance and a yogi's self-discipline. His funny poems are heartbreaking and his serious ones are hilarious.|$|R
