5|$|There are two {{categories}} of <b>kicks</b> in football: scrimmage <b>kicks,</b> which can be executed by the offensive team on any down from behind or on the line of scrimmage, and free <b>kicks.</b> The free <b>kicks</b> are the kickoff, which starts {{the first and third}} quarters and overtime and follows a try attempt or a successful field goal, and the safety kick, which follows a safety.|$|E

5|$|A soccer kick is {{performed}} when a fighter is standing {{to the side}} or {{in front of an}} opponent on the ground and <b>kicks</b> the grounded opponent's head. This is done in a style similar to an association football player kicking a football. Most practitioners aim to use their shins for the point of impact rather than the foot. While soccer <b>kicks</b> are usually delivered to the head, <b>kicks</b> {{to other parts of the}} body in a similar style are also referred to as soccer <b>kicks.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{three types}} of {{scrimmage}} <b>kicks</b> are place <b>kicks,</b> drop <b>kicks,</b> and punts. Only place <b>kicks</b> and drop <b>kicks</b> can score points. The place kick is the standard method used to score points, because the pointy shape of the football {{makes it difficult to}} reliably drop kick. Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage kick, it can be advanced by the kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line of scrimmage. If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead at the spot where it was touched. The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball, and the receiving team has the option of signaling for a fair catch. This prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver, but the play ends as soon as the ball is caught and the ball may not be advanced.|$|E
5|$|Bicycle <b>kicks</b> are {{generally}} done in two situations, one defensive {{and the other}} offensive. A defensive bicycle kick is done when a player facing his side's goal uses the action to clear {{the ball in the}} direction opposite his side's goalmouth. Sports historian Richard Witzig considers defensive bicycle <b>kicks</b> a desperate move requiring less aim than its offensive variety. An offensive bicycle kick is used when a player has his back to the opposing goal and is near the goalmouth. According to Witzig, the offensive bicycle kick requires concentration and a good understanding of the ball's location. Bicycle <b>kicks</b> can also be done in the midfield, but this is not recommended because safer and more accurate passes can be done in this zone.|$|E
5|$|Each team {{finished}} with twoturnoversVirginia Tech fumbled the ball once and threw oneinterception, while Boston College's offense threw two. Each team earned sevenpoints off of turnovers, and Virginia Tech blocked twokicks. The two blocked <b>kicks</b> effectively netted fivepoints for Virginia Tech, as the blocked field goal prevented Boston College from scoring threepoints, {{and the other}} blocked kick was returned 75yards for a rare defensive two-point conversion. The two blocked <b>kicks</b> by Virginia Tech were {{the first and second}} blocked <b>kicks</b> in ACC Championship Game history, and Boston College's fumble return for a touchdown was the first fumble recovery and defensive touchdown in ACC Championship Game history.|$|E
5|$|In the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) rulebook, {{the fair}} catch <b>kick</b> is {{specifically}} {{defined as a}} free <b>kick.</b> The National Football League (NFL) rulebook specifically states that the fair catch <b>kick</b> is not a free <b>kick,</b> instead considering the fair catch <b>kick</b> to be a distinct type of <b>kick.</b> Despite this, reporters at both levels describe the fair catch <b>kick</b> as a free <b>kick.</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{the relationship between}} <b>kicking</b> ball distance, <b>kicking</b> leg speed, and the volume of <b>kicking</b> leg, young soccer players from elementary school to University students were subjected ball <b>kicking.</b> The distance of the <b>kicked</b> ball was measured and muscle volume of <b>kicking</b> leg was obtained by MRI. The measured <b>kicking</b> speed and ball distance in each group was in the following order: elementary school < junior high school < high school < university. Significant correlation was observed between <b>kicking</b> speed and ball distance. In addition, muscle volume was lowest in elementary school students and highest in University students. Significant correlation was also observed between muscle volume and <b>kicking</b> speed or ball distance. Our results suggest that both <b>kicking</b> speed and muscle volume are important for <b>kicking</b> ball distance, as well as <b>kicking</b> techniques...|$|R

5|$|In {{front of}} the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines {{starting}} on the goal line 16.5m (18yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5m (18yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area {{has a number of}} functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul {{by a member of the}} defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal <b>kicks,</b> penalty <b>kicks</b> and corner <b>kicks.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} joint kinematics of the <b>kicking</b> leg in Taekwondo and to examine the role of inter-joint coordination of the leg in producing the <b>kicking</b> velocity. A new inter-joint coordination index that encompasses three- dimensional hip and knee motions, was defined and applied to the joint kinematic results. Twelve elite Taekwondo athletes participated in this study and performed the back <b>kick,</b> thrashing <b>kick,</b> turning-back <b>kick</b> and roundhouse <b>kick.</b> Our results indicate that the back <b>kick</b> utilized a combination of hip and knee extension to produce the <b>kicking</b> velocity, and was characterized by a pushlike movement. The thrashing <b>kick</b> and turning-back <b>kick</b> utilized a greater degree of hip abduction than the roundhouse <b>kick</b> and back <b>kick,</b> and included complicated knee motions. The new index successfully categorized the thrashing <b>kick</b> and turning-back <b>kick</b> into a push-throw continuum, indicating a change from negative index (opposite direction) to positive index (same direction) of hip and knee motions at the end of the movement. This strategy of push-throw continuum increases the <b>kicking</b> velocity at the moment of impact by applying a throwlike movement patter...|$|R

5|$|Cardiff won {{the coin}} toss and elected to kick first. Ben Blair and Julien Dupuy, the goal-kickers {{used during the}} match {{were the first to}} attempt <b>kicks</b> for their {{respective}} sides, were both successful. The teams then nominated other players on their team who had experience at goal-kicking, both teams being successful with their second and third <b>kicks.</b> Cardiff's fourth player Ceri Sweeney, was also an experienced goal-kicker and was successful; however, Leicester selected Johne Murphy, who was not a regular kicker, and he missed to make the score 4–3 after four of the five rounds. This meant if Cardiff were successful with their next kick, they would have an unassailable lead and would win the match. With no more experienced goal kickers to choose from, winger Tom James stepped up to take the kick, but missed, allowing Leicester the chance to draw level. Scott Hamilton scored with his kick to bring the scores to 4–4 after five <b>kicks</b> and take the shoot-out to sudden death. The teams were both successful with their next two <b>kicks,</b> including Craig Newby for Leicester who was the first forward to take a kick in the shoot-out. With all seven backs having already attempted a kick, Cardiff were required to select a forward player for their eighth kick, and chose flanker Martyn Williams. He missed, giving Leicester the chance to win the match if they were successful with their eighth kick. Number 8 Jordan Crane was selected for the attempt and was successful, resulting in Leicester winning the shoot-out 7–6 and advancing to the 2009 Heineken Cup Final.|$|E
