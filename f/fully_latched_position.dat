40|$|A {{coupling}} device is disclosed which is mechanically two fault tolerant for release. The device comprises a fastener plate and fastener body, {{each of which}} is attachable to a different one of a pair of structures to be joined. The fastener plate and body are coupled by an elongate toggle mounted at one end in a socket on the fastener plate for universal pivotal movement thereon. The other end of the toggle is received in an opening in the fastener body and adapted for limited pivotal movement therein. The toggle is adapted to be restrained by three latch hooks arranged in symmetrical equiangular spacing about the axis of the toggle, each hook being mounted on the fastener body for pivotal movement between an unlatching non-contact position with respect to the toggle and a <b>latching</b> <b>position</b> in engagement with a latching surface of the toggle. The device includes releasable lock means for locking each latch hook in its <b>latching</b> <b>position</b> whereby the toggle couples the fastener plate to the fastener body and means for releasing the lock means to unlock each said latch hook from the <b>latch</b> <b>position</b> whereby the unlocking of {{at least one of the}} latch hooks from its <b>latching</b> <b>position</b> results in the decoupling of the fastener plate from the fastener body...|$|R

40|$|Period Covered: October 2012 -July 2013 This paper {{explores the}} {{geometric}} feasibility of installing dedicated lower anchors {{in the center}} rear seating positions of vehicles. Analysis {{was based on a}} previous research study in which the lateral spacing of seat belt and LATCH lower anchorages were measured in 85 model year 2010 - 2011 vehicles. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine how many vehicles would have the physical space to incorporate a third set of dedicated lower anchors in the center seating position for child restraint installation. Usability of all of the lower anchors, as well as the seat belts, was also considered. To begin, nine vehicles that currently have dedicated lower anchors in the center position were reviewed. The distances between all seat belt anchors and lower anchors across the vehicle sample were also analyzed to identify spacings that are currently feasible in production. The arrangement of seat belt and lower anchor hardware across the rear seat was also reviewed with respect to usability. Based on these analyses, a lateral distance between the outboard webbing and outboard lower anchor of 75 to 100 mm is common. The suggested minimum distance between lower anchors and seat belt hardware is 25 mm. Based on these dimensions, vehicles with 710 mm or more between the outboard lower anchor centerlines (OBLACL) should have sufficient space to provide three sets of usable, dedicated lower anchors in the right, center, and left seating positions. Providing the highest level of usability with regard to use of seat belt or LATCH hardware in adjacent seating positions would be achieved by placing each pair of lower anchors between the webbing and buckle hardware for the seating position. If the OBLACL is less than 710 mm, an improvised center <b>LATCH</b> <b>position</b> (permitting use of the inboard lower anchors from the outboard seating positions to secure a child restraint in the center seating position) may be feasible. The maximum spacing of this improvised center <b>LATCH</b> <b>position</b> would be 480 mm. If a vehicle allowed an improvised center <b>LATCH</b> <b>position,</b> placing the inboard lower anchor between the outboard buckle and nearest center seat belt hardware would maximize usability of the seat belt in the outboard seating position and lower anchors in the center seating position...|$|R

40|$|The release {{mechanism}} (REM) unlatches an experiment {{so that it}} can be moved about inside and outside the shuttle bay by the remote manipulator system (RMS), and then reattaches it to the REM base. Operated from the crew compartment after the RMS has been attached to the experiment, the REM releases the experiment by an electric motor driving a gear train and linkage which extracts four pins from holes in four plates. Electrical connectors on the REM are disengaged by the mechanical action of the structural pins retracting from the plates. When the REM releases the experiment, an unlatched indicator is actuated in the crew compartment, and then the experiment can be moved by using the RMS. To reattach the experiment to the REM, the RMS places the experiment with REM attachment angles against the flat, smooth surface of the REM; then the RMS moves the experiment into position for latchup. Actuation of an electric motor drives the four pins into the four holes in the plates.

40|$|Background: Effective {{breastfeeding}} is {{a function}} of the proper positioning of mother and baby and attachment of child to the mother's breast. Positioning of the baby's body is important for good attachment and successful breastfeeding. The study was planned to assess mother–infant pair <b>latch</b> on <b>position</b> and its impact on health status of the child. Materials and Methods: It was community-based cross-sectional study conducted among 1267 children between age group of 0 – 24 months in the urban and rural field practice areas of the Department of Community Medicine, Maharishi Markandeshwar Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Mullana, Ambala, Haryana. A self-designed semi-structured questionnaire along with the WHO criteria for assessment of correct <b>latch</b> on <b>position</b> was used in this study. Results: Out of 1267 mothers, only 29. 9 % mothers initiated breastfeeding within 1 h of delivery. Mothers who had high parity had better positioning scores as compared to mothers with low parity.

40|$|This paper extends pin-tool {{research}} by investigating a new method to accurately position high-fidelity pins in an array, with each pin uniquely positioned under computer control. The resultant tool is a reusable prototyping {{system for the}} rapid generation of three-dimension (3 -D) profiles using CAD extracted data, with application potential {{in a variety of}} manufacturing processes. A control assessment identifies a combination of array-addressing, <b>latching</b> <b>positioning</b> hardware, and a combined "setting platen" pin-position feedback and drive as an appropriate technique for pin control. The novel platen motion strategy is capable of moving thousands of pins with a single drive motor. The system incorporates latching "locks" that operate on the "tail" of a new two-part "header and tail" pin design. Key to the lock strategy is the application of shape memory alloy actuators in a back-to-back configuration; the response of this material to electrical input is quantified and applied to achieve the unique lock design. Multiple locks combined into a demonstrator position headers to an accuracy of + 0. 09 - 0. 05 mm. The mounting pitch of the prototype system permits the use of 1. 0 mm section pins. An extension to the design ultimately allows a 15 000 pin-array to be positioned in similar to 3 min. Note to Practitioners-This research was motivated by the apparent lack of a technique to uniquely position small section pins in an array, without a bulky control system, power limitations, or motion system restrictions. Prior approaches to positioning pins in an array have used multiplexed or sequential control on pins of 6 mm section or larger. This research investigates a combined control system/hardware approach applied to pins of 1 mm square section, scalable to move thousands of pins uniquely. The presented novel solutions generate a higher fidelity surface definition than previous systems. Extending existing research on surface-smoothing interpolators that reduce the "staircase" effect generated by discrete pins would be beneficial. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{biological}} nurturing and activation of maternal and infant instincts after birth have constituted a major advance in clinical breastfeeding support. Yet, physiologic breastfeeding initiation {{is not enough}} to ensure ongoing pain-free and effective breastfeeding for many pairs. Current interventions, including “hands-off” mammalian approaches, do not improve breastfeeding outcomes, including in randomized controlled trials. Back-arching, difficulty latching or staying on the breast, and fussing at the breast are common signs of infant positional instability during breastfeeding. These cues are, however, often misdiagnosed as signs of medical conditions or oral connective tissue abnormalities, and underlying positional instability is not addressed. New clinical approaches are urgently required. This article offers a clinical approach to fit and hold (or <b>latch</b> and <b>positioning)</b> —gestalt breastfeeding, which aims to optimize positional stability and intraoral breast tissue volumes for pain-free effective breastfeeding. The word gestalt (pronounced “ger-shtolt”) means a whole that is {{more than the sum of}} its parts. Gestalt breastfeeding builds on the theoretical foundations of complexity science, physiologic breastfeeding initiation, and new understandings of the biomechanics of infant suck elucidated in ultrasound studies. It also integrates simple psychological strategies from applied functional contextualism, popularly known as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, empowering women to attend mindfully to breast sensations and their infant’s cues. Gestalt breastfeeding can be reproduced for research purposes, including in comparison studies with oral surgery, and has the potential to improve breastfeeding outcomes.
