50|$|Many social {{democratic}} parties, particularly after the Cold War, adopted neoliberal market policies including privatisation, deregulation and <b>financialisation.</b> They abandoned {{their pursuit of}} moderate socialism in favour of market liberalism. By the 1980s, {{with the rise of}} conservative neoliberal politicians such as Ronald Reagan in the United States, Margaret Thatcher in Britain, Brian Mulroney in Canada and Augusto Pinochet in Chile, the Western welfare state was attacked from within, but state support for the corporate sector was maintained. Monetarists and neoliberals attacked social welfare systems as impediments to private entrepreneurship. In the UK, Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock made a public attack against the entryist group Militant at the 1985 Labour Party conference. The Labour Party ruled that Militant was ineligible for affiliation with the Labour Party, and the party gradually expelled Militant supporters. The Kinnock leadership had refused to support the 1984-1985 miner's strike over pit closures, a decision that the party's left wing and the National Union of Mineworkers blamed for the strike's eventual defeat. In 1989, at Stockholm, the 18th Congress of the Socialist International adopted a new Declaration of Principles, saying:Democratic socialism is an international movement for freedom, social justice, and solidarity. Its goal is to achieve a peaceful world where these basic values can be enhanced and where each individual can live a meaningful life with the full development of his or her personality and talents, and with the guarantee of human and civil rights in a democratic framework of society.|$|E
5000|$|Institutions such as hedge funds, {{pension funds}} and {{investment}} banks like Barclays Capital, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been instrumental in pushing up prices {{in the last five}} years, with investment in food commodities rising from $65bn to $126bn (£41bn to £79bn) between 2007 and 2012, contributing to 30-year highs. This has caused price fluctuations which are not strongly related to the actual supply of food, according to the United Nations. Financial institutions now make up 61% of all investment in wheat futures.

40|$|The <b>financialisation</b> {{literature}} has grown {{over the past}} two decades. While there is a generally accepted definition, effectively <b>financialisation</b> has been used to describe very different phenomena. This paper proposes a multi-faceted notion of <b>financialisation</b> by distinguishing between <b>financialisation</b> of non-financial companies, households and the financial sector and using activity as well as vulnerability measures of <b>financialisation.</b> We identify seven <b>financialisation</b> hypotheses in the literature and empirically investigate them in a cross-country analysis for 17 OECD countries for the 1997 - 2007 period. We find that different <b>financialisation</b> measures are only weakly correlated, which suggests the existence of distinct <b>financialisation</b> processes. There is strong evidence across all sectors that <b>financialisation</b> is closely linked to asset price inflation and correlated with a debt-driven demand regime. Financial deregulation encourages <b>financialisation,</b> especially in the financial and household sector. By contrast, there is limited evidence that market-based financial systems tend to be more financialised, meaning <b>financialisation</b> can occur with large banks. Foreign financial inflows {{do not seem to be}} a main driver.

40|$|This paper aims at {{providing}} an overall {{assessment of the}} relation between <b>financialisation</b> and well-being in five EU countries and thereby contribute to broader theoretical and policy-related discussions. It seeks to contribute to the <b>financialisation</b> literature by examining the differentiated impacts of <b>financialisation</b> on individuals and households. And it does so by analysing four conduits through which <b>financialisation</b> processes have impacted on well-being. First, it assesses the differentiated involvement of individuals and households with financial markets through both their savings and borrowing behaviours, which are not homogenous across the various socioeconomic groups nor across countries. Second, it examines the impact of <b>financialisation</b> through its effects on the housing system of provision, exposing how <b>financialisation</b> interacts with corresponding systems of provision and how such interactions entail new forms and levels of inequality. Third, the impact of <b>financialisation</b> is examined through the broader effects of the financial crisis on employment, disposable income and welfare provision. Finally, the impact of <b>financialisation</b> is examined by taking into account the perspectives of those excluded from financial markets, further exposing the inequalitygenerating effects of <b>financialisation</b> processes. The paper offers a more nuanced account than that presently available in the <b>financialisation</b> literature.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a review of}} research into <b>financialisation</b> of the environment, focusing {{on the role of}} <b>financialisation</b> in the interface between social and natural dimensions of sustainability, the geographical penetration of finance into environmental sectors, and its increasing control over the production of nature and environmental governance through regulating flows of capital and consequently material flows. <b>Financialisation</b> is conceptualised as a profoundly spatial process, forging financial ecologies with consequences crucial to conditions for sustainability of social-ecological systems. The paper introduces the theme by framing <b>financialisation</b> in historical contexts. <b>Financialisation</b> of the environment is then related to processes of commodification, privatisation, neoliberalisation and accumulation by dispossession within the broader context of intersections between political economy and political ecology, highlighting the distinction between use-value/object-oriented investments and exchange-value/’investor’- oriented investments, the right to inhabit place, and the shift from control and command to economic incentives, drawing out implications for sustainability.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{attempts}} a firm-level {{study of}} <b>financialisation</b> in the Indian context. In {{the last few}} decades, many {{studies have shown that}} <b>financialisation</b> or the increased dominance of the financial sector tends to have a profound and mostly negative impact of real sector growth and accumulation. The consequent declining real investment and accumulation is likely to affect future growth adversely along with employment and income levels. This study attempts a firm level look at <b>financialisation</b> and real capital accumulation, using data on companies constituting the SENSEX. We use the Least squares dummy variable model (LSDV) model for the short panel data to analyses if the impact of <b>financialisation</b> as estimated by dividend payouts and rentier shares on real capital accumulation is significant. The paper contributes to the existing literature in two ways: first, by introducing a microeconomic perspective on <b>financialisation</b> especially in the context of firms who are likely to be affected by <b>financialisation</b> and secondly, by introducing both dividend payouts along with rentier shares as independent variables representing <b>financialisation.</b> The paper finds a negative impact of <b>financialisation</b> as reflected in higher dividend payouts and increasing rentier shares on real capital accumulation, suggesting there is a likely tradeoff between shareholder orientation and real capital accumulation. This implies that increasing rentier shares and dividend payouts affect negatively real capital accumulation which may lead to future growth being compromised. It is pertinent for firms to have a balance between shareholder value and long-run growth of the firm for which real capital accumulation will be important...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a preliminary {{analysis of the}} variegated extent of <b>financialisation</b> of European economies since circa 1980. For this purpose, the broad characterisation of <b>financialisation</b> offered by Fine (2012) is adopted. This characterisation identifies eight features of the <b>financialisation</b> process. We focus in particular {{on the size of}} the financial sector within a selection of European economies. Data show that the <b>financialisation</b> process is not reflected in the share of employment in the financial sector. This is likely to be the result of the labour-saving nature of technological and organisational innovations introduced in the financial sector in the last two decades. By contrast, the increasing weight of finance in the economy is reflected in the ratio of the value added of the financial sector to total value added and by the ratio of the value of financial assets to GDP. Overall, we find that most European countries have undergone a process of <b>financialisation</b> in the last three decades. However, this process has been variegated, leading us to coin the term ‘variegated financialisation’. The variegation of the <b>financialisation</b> process is likely to be explained by differences in economic and social structures between nations, regions and systems...|$|E

We focus primarily on <b>financialisation</b> of housing, and do so from the methodologicalperspective of variegated financialisation: as a generic process that contextually coevolves with related processes such as neoliberalisation and polarisation,encompassing variegated sets of institutions and social relations. <b>Financialisation</b> is a process whereby privatisation, commodification and securitisation of resources and elements of (built) environments allow for the penetration of financial control and decision-making power into the fabric of societies and environments. Housing is financialised when it is treated above all as a financial asset, i. e. for its exchange value, rather than for its use value. We conclude that <b>financialisation</b> of housing has had severely adverse impacts on democracy, social cohesion and sustainability. Policies for containing <b>financialisation</b> of housing need to include measures to decommodify housing and urban space more generally, institutionalise floors and ceilings on income and wealth, deepen democracy and use-value-oriented decisionmaking, and replace market-fundamentalist ideology with egalitarian ideas that recognise our interdependence, how we mutually constitute one another, how we aredependent upon and owe solidarity to others...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the link between}} <b>financialisation</b> and emerging market government policy autonomy. It analyses the government bond markets of three case study countries: Brazil, Lebanon and Turkey. Using extensive interview data in the three countries, and interviews with financial market actors in London and New York, the study explores the investment behaviour {{of a range of}} investors: commercial banks; individual investors; mutual funds; pension funds and hedge funds. The thesis uses the framework of <b>financialisation</b> – measured by the ability to trade risk – to analyse both international and domestic investors. The study shows that increased <b>financialisation,</b> of both financial market actors and the structure of government bond markets, generally serves to reduce loyalty and therefore reduces government policy autonomy. However, it is demonstrated that initial <b>financialisation</b> – the development of pension and mutual funds – serves to increase autonomy. This is captured by the construction of an ‘autonomy curve’. The conclusions suggest an updating the use of Hirschman’s concept of voice, exit and loyalty in the analysis of financial markets, to give a greater emphasis on loyalty and to include the use of ‘disloyalty’, the ability to short securities. It is also argued that <b>financialisation</b> is the appropriate framework to analyse processes of change in financial markets.

We argue that this is largely attributable to <b>financialisation,</b> which creates tension with the university's charitable status. The paper commences with a brief history of incorporation, and examines developments in corporate governance. With the dominance of finance, and the treatment of institutions as mere nexus of contracts, distinctions between public and private become redundant. The paper continues with an account of the effects of <b>financialisation</b> on university governance, under which the university acts increasingly like a for-profit corporation, with its financial governance in direct contradiction to its charitable status.
