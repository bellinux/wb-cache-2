This is why, the aim of the present work is to determine the conditions of the chromium nitride formation in a cold-rolled ULC steel with 0. 7 % Cr. In order to simulate the precipitation which may occur during the coiling or during the recrystallization annealing of the sheets, the investigated steel was submitted to different thermal treatments at temperatures ranging from 600 to 850 °C. Then, the {{nitrogen content}} remaining in solution was evaluated after having defined a specific procedure based on thermoelectric power (TEP) measurements and using the segregation of the nitrogen atoms in solution to the dislocations introduced in the steel by cold-rolling. It was shown that the maximum precipitation speed is obtained at 650 °C and that the precipitation is considerably delayed when the steel was recrystallized before the treatment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{thermoelectric}} power (or TEP) {{technique was}} used to determine the segregation kinetics of the interstitial atoms (C or N) to the dislocations in various <b>extra-mild</b> <b>steels</b> submitted to a heavy deformation by cold-rolling when substitutional atoms (Mn or Cr) are simultaneously in solid solution. It was shown that the substitutional atoms (Mn or Cr) have almost no influence on the segregation kinetics of carbon and on the activation energy associated with the segregation of this element. In contrast, these elements tend to delay the segregation kinetics of nitrogen to the dislocations all the more so as their content in solution is high. In the mean time, the activation energy associated with the segregation of nitrogen is increased...|$|R
