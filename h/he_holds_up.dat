25|$|Despite his {{admitted}} cowardice, Flashman is a dab hand at fighting {{when he has}} to. Though he dodges danger {{as much as he}} can, {{and runs}} away when no one is watching, after the Piper's Fort incident, he usually controls his fear and often performs bravely. Almost every book contains one or more incidents where Flashman has to fight or perform some other daring action, and <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> long enough to complete it. For instance, he is ordered to accompany the Light Brigade on its famous charge and rides {{all the way to the}} Russian guns. However, most of these acts of 'bravery' are performed only when he has absolutely no choice and to do anything else would result in his being exposed as a coward and losing his respected status in society, or being shot for desertion. When he can act like a coward with impunity, he invariably does.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Gates {{appeared}} {{in a series of}} ads to promote Microsoft. The first commercial, co-starring Jerry Seinfeld, is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. [...] The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977, for a traffic violation. As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a [...] "Yes", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a [...] "Yes". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about [...] "nothing" [...] (Seinfeld). In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.|$|E
500|$|The film's plot survives {{because of}} Universal's {{publication}} of the details in Moving Picture News. The official description is as follows, [...] "Charity, through excessive organization, often defeats its own purpose. William Weldon, a telegraph lineman, {{is the father of}} a large family, and finds it a hard struggle to make ends meet on his small wages. By a fall from a telegraph pole one afternoon he sustains injuries which force a lay-off for several weeks. His family is left destitute and, after a time, seek aid from various charity organizations. In each case the organization promises to make a full investigation and do what they can, but by the time all the red tape and rules are complied with, the family would starve. In the meantime, Marx, a gentleman thief who has a secret retreat in the same building in which the Weldon family live, meets the invalid daughter, Alice Weldon. She tells him of the family's condition and Marx endeavors to aid her, although at the time he is out of ready cash himself. Taking desperate measures, <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> a doctor and forces him to attend to Weldon. Then, in company with the female leader of the gang, he attends the charity ball. There he makes a haul — plucking jewelry and trinkets from every one with whom he comes in contact. He pawns the stolen articles and uses the money to help the Weldons. After the family has recovered, through Marx's aid, the charity organizations finally send a few dollars and a skimpy supply of food. Marx decides to reform — in fact, his reformation has been intended for some time, and his last [...] "job" [...] was only the outcome of his desire to do a worthy charity. He goes to the police, declares himself, and surrenders. Marx is sentenced, and while sitting in his cell a vision of Alice appeared before him, repaying him for his sacrifice and charity." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{keeping with}} Dante's desires to satirize the {{original}} film, the sequel has some meta-references and self-referential humor. These include a cameo appearance by film critic Leonard Maltin. <b>He</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> {{a copy of}} the original Gremlins home video and denounces it, just as he had in reality; however, his rant is cut short when gremlins pounce on him. Partly for this scene, one academic called Dante [...] "one of contemporary cinema's great pranksters." ...|$|E
2500|$|McIntyre {{asked what}} they would do if he induced his comrades to {{surrender}}. Kelly stated, [...] "I'll shoot no man if <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> his hands", and that he would detain them all night, as he wanted a sleep, and let them go next morning without their guns or horses. McIntyre said that he would induce them to surrender if Kelly kept his word, and added that one of the two had many children. Kelly said, [...] "You can depend on us." [...] Kelly stated that Fitzpatrick was the cause of all this; that his mother and the rest had been unjustly [...] "lagged" [...] at Beechworth. He told McIntyre to leave the police force. McIntyre agreed, saying that he had thought about it for some time due to bad health. Ned asked McIntyre why their search party was carrying so much ammunition. McIntyre replied that it was to shoot kangaroos.|$|E

2500|$|Kovel {{believes}} that examples like the Christian Bruderhof Communities (despite elements of patriarchy that he attacks) show that [...] "communistic" [...] organizations can [...] "survive rather {{well in a}} heavily industrialized market" [...] if they are [...] "protected" [...] from the dependence on the market by [...] "anti-capitalist intentionality". He further posits that class struggle is [...] "internationalized {{in the face of}} globalization", as evidenced by a wave of strikes across the Global South {{in the first half of}} the year 2000; indeed, he says that [...] "labor's most cherished values are already immanently ecocentric". Kovel therefore thinks that these universalizing tendencies must lead to the formation of [...] "a consciously 'Ecosocialist Party'" [...] that is neither like a parliamentary or vanguardist party. Instead, Kovel advocates a form of political party [...] "grounded in communities of resistance", where delegates from these communities form the core of the party's activists, and these delegates and the [...] "open and transparent" [...] assembly they form are subject to recall and regular rotation of members. <b>He</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) and the Gaviotas movement as examples of such communities, which [...] "are produced outside capitalist circuits" [...] and show that [...] "there can be no single way valid for all peoples". Nonetheless, he also firmly believes in connecting these movements, stating that [...] "ecosocialism will be international or it will be nothing" [...] and hoping that the Ecosocialist Party can retain the autonomy of local communities while supporting them materially. With an ever-expanding party, Kovel hopes that [...] "defections" [...] by capitalists will occur, leading eventually to the armed forces and police who, in joining the revolution, will signify that [...] "the turning point is reached".|$|E

He calmly regards the dark man with the lantern. That man, of course, is Jasper. The young man is EDWIN DROOD, of the Grecian nose, hyacinthine locks, and classic features, as in Sir L.

In the peaceful time of full barns, and when {{the noise of the}} peaceful flail is abroad, and the hum of peaceful commerce resounds, is the grandson of two Generals a warrior too? Oh, not for naught, in the time of this seeming peace, are warrior grandsires given to Pierre! For Pierre is a warrior too; Life his campaign, and three fierce allies, Woe and Scorn and Want, his foes. The wide world is banded against him; for lo you! <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> the standard of Right, and swears by the Eternal and True! But ah, Pierre, Pierre, when thou goest to that bed, how humbling the thought, that thy most extended length measures not the proud six feet four of thy grand John of Gaunt sire! The stature of the warrior is cut down to the dwindled glory of the fight. For more glorious in real tented field to strike down your valiant foe, than in the conflicts of a noble soul with a dastardly world to chase a vile enemy who ne'er will show front.|$|E
60|$|There {{are three}} ways of dam-building in general use among the beavers. The first is {{for use on}} sluggish, alder-fringed streams, where they can build up from the bottom. Two or three sunken logs form the foundation, which is from three to five feet broad. Sticks, driftwood, and stout poles, which the beavers cut on the banks, are piled on this and {{weighted}} with stones and mud. The stones are rolled in from the bank or moved considerable distances under water. The mud is carried in the beaver's paws, which <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> against his chin so as to carry a big handful without spilling. Beavers love such streams, with their alder shade and sweet grasses and fringe of wild meadow, better than all other places. And, by the way, most of the natural meadows and half the ponds of New England were made by beavers. If {{you go to the}} foot of any little meadow in the woods and dig at the lower end, where the stream goes out, you will find, sometimes ten feet under the surface, the remains of the first dam that formed the meadow when the water flowed back and killed the trees.|$|E
60|$|In {{the chapter}} which I have been examining, Mr Godwin professes to {{consider}} the objection to his system of equality from the principle of population. It has appeared, I think clearly, that he is greatly erroneous in his statement of the distance of this difficulty, and that instead of myriads of centuries, it is really not thirty years, or even thirty days, distant from us. The supposition of the approach of man to immortality on earth is certainly not of a kind to soften the difficulty. The only argument, therefore, in the chapter which has any tendency to remove the objection is the conjecture concerning the extinction of the passion between the sexes, but as this is a mere conjecture, unsupported by the smallest shadow of proof, {{the force of the}} objection may be fairly said to remain unimpaired, and it is undoubtedly of sufficient weight of itself completely to overturn Mr Godwin's whole system of equality. I will, however, make one or two observations on a few of the prominent parts of Mr Godwin's reasonings which will contribute to place in a still clearer point of view the little hope that we can reasonably entertain of those vast improvements in the nature of man and of society which <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> to our admiring gaze in his Political Justice.|$|E
