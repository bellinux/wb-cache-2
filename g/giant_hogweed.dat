25|$|Although <b>giant</b> <b>hogweed</b> {{is taking}} hold along the Annick (2006), however the {{riparian}} (water side) flora is still indicative of long established and undisturbed habitats. The rare crosswort, (a {{relative of the}} goosegrass or cleavers) is found nearby. The river contains, amongst others, brown trout, sea trout, salmon, eels, minnows, and stickleback. The water quality is much improved since the Stewarton cloth mills closed and the river no longer carries their dyes and other pollutants {{as shown by the}} presence of freshwater limpets and shrimps, together with leeches, caddis fly larvae and water snail species.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the water}} meadows are rich in pignut (Conopodium majus), a {{relative}} of parsley, which formed a breaktime snack for children in former times. The plant is dug up to harvest a small potato-like structure that, eaten raw, has a slightly nutty taste. It is available commercially for salads, etc. Hemlock water dropwort grows well in the wetter areas and is best left alone as the name hemlock suggests. The large leaves of the butterbur (Petasites hybridus) are found in several areas; its name harkens {{back to the days}} before clingfilm or cheap paper when the leaves were used to wrap butter destined for the market. Water ragwort (or Saracen's ragwort) (a species of Senecio) is an introduced plant that grows along the Garnock in tall stands. Although it is common on the Garnock and at present quite rare elsewhere. Himalayan balsam or policemen's helmets is another introduction, but a common one. <b>Giant</b> <b>hogweed</b> is beginning to make its presence felt. It is another plant that should never be handled, as the sap can cause severe blistering and scarring of the skin.|$|E

This thesis developed a microsatellite library for hogweeds, reconstructed the introduction history and evaluated the impact of H. persicum on Norwegian plant diversity. The microsatellite markers clearly discriminated the genetic structure of exotic invasive <b>giant</b> <b>hogweeds,</b> a native hogweed, and their invasive hybrids. Heracleum persicum was introduced twice from Iran to Denmark and England. English populations subsequently colonized Finland. In contrast to the contemporary hypothesis of an English origin of Norwegian populations, Finland appeared as a more likely source. The cover of H. persicum had a strong negative effect on the native cover. The invaded plots had on average nearly two native species less than the non-invaded plots. Plant communities containing H. persicum appeared less susceptible to further invasion. Overall, the impact of H. persicum on native plant diversity outweighs the invasion resistance it offers. In conclusion, the strong negative impact of H. persicum on the Norwegian plant diversity justifies the need for the urgent management interventions to control and eradicate H. persicum. High invasiveness in Norwegian populations of H. persicum despite low levels of genetic diversity indicates that even a small founder population may cause high impact. The developed set of microsatellite markers may serve as an important genetic resource for understanding taxonomy, population genetics and phylogeny of <b>giant</b> <b>hogweeds</b> and their hybrids, which in turn, are expected to contribute to biodiversity conservation by invasive species management...|$|R

500|$|A {{number of}} [...] non-native, {{invasive}} {{species have been}} identified as a threat to native biodiversity, including <b>Giant</b> <b>Hogweed,</b> Japanese Knotweed and Rhododendron. In May 2008 it was announced that psyllid lice from Japan, which feed on the Knotweed, may be introduced to the UK to bring the plant under control. This would be the first time that an alien species has been used in Britain in this way. Scientists at the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux International do not believe the lice will cause any environmental damage. Over-grazing caused by the large numbers of Red Deer and sheep has also resulted in the impoverishment of moorland and upland habitats and a loss of native woodland.|$|E

40|$|Since {{first of}} January 2015, the EU-regulation 1143 / 2014 obligates {{all member states}} to conduct {{cost-benefit}} analyses in preparation of control programs for invasive alien species to minimize and mitigate their impacts. In addition, with ratification of the Rio Declaration and the amended Federal Nature Conservation Act, Germany is committed to control any further spread of invasive species. This is the first cost-benefit analysis estimating positive welfare effects and societal importance of H. mantegazzianum invasion control in Germany. The paper analyses possible control options limiting stands of <b>giant</b> <b>hogweeds</b> (H. mantegazzianum) based on survey data of n = 287 German districts. We differentiate between several control options (e. g. root destruction, mechanical cutting or mowing, chemical treatment and grazing) depending on infested area size and protection status. The calculation of benefits is based on stated preference results (choice experiment; n = 282). For the cost side, we calculate two different invasion scenarios (i) no re-infestation after successfully conducted control measures (optimistic) and (ii) re-infestation twice after conducting control measures occurring within ten years (pessimistic). Minimum costs of eradication measures including a time span of ten years and a social discount rate of 1 % result {{in a total of}} 3, 467, 640 € for optimistic scenario and 6, 254, 932 € for pessimistic invasion scenario, where no success of the first eradication attempt is assumed.

40|$|The {{ability of}} <b>giant</b> <b>hogweeds</b> to form monodominant {{communities}} and even pure monostands in invaded areas {{has been well}} documented. Understanding of the mechanisms leading to monostand formation can aid in determining the limitations of existing community ecology models and establishing an effective management plan for invasive species elimination. The aim of this observational {{study was to investigate}} traits of Heracleum sosnowskyi plants (demography, canopy structure, morphology and physiology) of the plants in a pure stand in an invaded area useful for understanding potential monostand formation mechanisms. All measurements were performed in one typical Heracleum sosnowskyi monostand located in an abandoned agriculture field located in Syktyvkar city suburb (North-east Russia). This monostand consisted of five main plant growth stages: seed, seedling, juvenile, vegetative adult, and generative adult. Plants of all stages began to grow simultaneously shortly after the snowmelt, {{at the same time as}} spring ephemeral plant species grew. The density of generative plants did not change during the vegetation period, but the density of the other plant stages rapidly decreased after the formation of a tall (up to 2 - 2. 5 m) and dense (Leaf area index up to 6. 5) canopy. The canopy captured approximately 97 % of the light. H. sosnowskyi showed high (several orders of magnitude higher than average taiga zone grasses) photosynthetic water use efficiency (6 - 7 μM CO 2 /μM H 2 O). Formation of H. sosnowskyi monostands occurs primarily in disturbed areas with relatively rich and well-moistened soils. Early commencement of growth, rapid formation of a dense canopy, high efficiency of light and water use during photosynthesis, ability of young plants to survive in low light conditions, rapid recovery of above-ground plant parts after damage, and the high density of the soil seed bank are the most important traits of H. sosnowskyi plants for monostand formation in invaded areas...|$|R

50|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>hogweed</b> {{was among}} many foreign plants {{introduced}} to Britain in the 19th century as ornamental plants. It is now widespread throughout the British Isles, especially along riverbanks. By forming dense stands, they can displace native plants and reduce wildlife habitats.

2500|$|In {{almost all}} {{cultures}} objects are named using {{one or two}} words equivalent to [...] "kind" [...] (genus) and [...] "particular kind" [...] (species). When made up of two words (a binomial) the name usually consists of a noun (like salt, dog or star) and an adjectival second word that helps describe the first, and therefore makes the name, as a whole, more [...] "specific", for example, lap dog, sea salt, or film star. The meaning of the noun used for a common name may have been lost or forgotten (whelk, elm, lion, shark, pig) but when the common name is extended to two or more words much more is conveyed about the organism's use, appearance or other special properties (sting ray, poison apple, <b>giant</b> stinking <b>hogweed,</b> hammerhead shark). These noun-adjective binomials are just like our own names with a family or surname like Simpson and another adjectival Christian or forename name that specifies which Simpson, say Homer Simpson. It seems {{reasonable to assume that}} the form of scientific names we call binomial nomenclature is derived from this simple and practical way of constructing common names - but with the use of Latin as a universal language.|$|R
5000|$|The sap of the <b>giant</b> <b>hogweed</b> {{plant is}} phototoxic; when the {{contacted}} skin {{is exposed to}} sunlight or to ultraviolet rays, it can cause phytophotodermatitis (severe skin inflammations). Initially, the skin colours red and starts itching. Blisters form as it burns within 48 hours. They form black or purplish scars that can last several years. Hospitalisation may be necessary. Although many media reports on <b>giant</b> <b>hogweed</b> suggest the plant can lead to temporary or permanent blindness, existing research on the plant does not back up this claim.|$|E
5000|$|Because of its {{phototoxicity}} and invasive nature, <b>giant</b> <b>hogweed</b> {{is often}} actively removed.

Hogweed is regulated as a federal noxious weed by the US government, and is illegal to import into the United States or move interstate without a permit from the Department of Agriculture. [...] The USDA Forest Service states pigs and cattle can eat it without apparent harm. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has had an active program to control <b>giant</b> <b>hogweed</b> since 2008, including reporting, database maintenance, and crews for removal or herbicide control. In 2011, Maine state horticulturists, describing the plant as [...] "Queen Anne's lace on steroids," [...] reported that it has been found at 21 different locations in Maine, with the number of plants ranging from one to a hundred.|$|E
