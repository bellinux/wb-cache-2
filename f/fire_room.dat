5|$|Assigned to the American Patrol Detachment, Schurz {{departed}} Charleston {{toward the}} end of April and, for the next two months, conducted patrols and performed escort duty and towing missions along the east coast and in the Caribbean. On 19 June, she departed New York for Key West. At 04:44 on the 21st, southwest of Cape Lookout lightship, she was rammed by the merchant ship Florida. The ship hit Schurz on the starboard side, crumpling that wing of the bridge, penetrating the well and berth deck about 12 feet, and cutting through bunker no. 3 to the forward <b>fire</b> <b>room.</b> One of Schurzs crewmen was killed instantly; twelve others were injured. Schurz was abandoned and sank three hours later. The ship was struck from the Navy list on 26 August 1918.|$|E

After receiving battle repairs alongside , the light cruiser continued east, arriving at San Francisco via Pearl Harbor on 11 May. Moving into the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation yard the warship received three weeks of long overdue repairs and machinery maintenance. Following completion of this work on 6 July, Biloxi conducted two weeks of post overhaul checks and refresher training out of San Diego and San Clemente. These evolutions were disrupted on 14 July when a water feed line ruptured in the aft <b>fire</b> <b>room,</b> flashed into steam and burned eight men, none seriously.|$|E
25|$|At 20:02 on 2 November 1944, U-181 fired {{a single}} torpedo that hit Fort Lee under the port quarter and {{destroyed}} her boilers, stopping her engines and flooding the <b>fire</b> <b>room.</b> Two {{men in the}} engine room {{were killed by the}} torpedo. At 20:18, as lifeboats #3 and #5 were being lowered into the water, a second torpedo hit the starboard quarter. Two men aboard Fort Lee were killed by the second blast. Lifeboat #3 was destroyed by this torpedo, killing 6 of 7 men aboard, and lifeboat #5 was broken in half, dumping its men into the ocean. Lifeboats #1, #2, #4, and #6 were successfully launched and recovered the survivors from #3 and #5. Fort Lee succumbed to the attack stern first at 21:10.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{architect of}} the Roger Mowry Tavern is not known for certain. Robert A.

The original house began as a -story stone ender with a single [...] by roughly [...] <b>fire</b> <b>room.</b> Running lengthwise across the middle of the room is a large summer beam. On the right side of the fireplace was the stairs or ladder that lead to the upstairs chamber. At an unknown date, the roof of the original house was extended higher, as evidenced by the original beams ending about [...] above the floor. By 1711, the house had a two-story lean-to. By the late 19th century the house had been greatly altered, but the original structure was restored by Robert Isham. Isham found and restored the house, which still featured the original posts and beams. The large fireplace remained intact, but was concealed behind a fireboard and closet, that was itself behind a stove. The result was that stone fireplace was completely concealed prior to restoration. Less than a decade later after Isham restored the original part of the house, the whole structure was demolished.|$|E
40|$|The famous go/no go command for Space Shuttle {{launches}} {{comes from}} {{a place called the}} <b>Firing</b> <b>Room.</b> Located at Kennedy Space Center in the Launch Control Center (LCC), there are actually four <b>Firing</b> <b>Rooms</b> that take up most of {{the third floor of the}} LCC. These rooms comprise the nerve center for Space Shuttle launch and processing. Test engineers in the <b>Firing</b> <b>Rooms</b> operate the Launch Processing System (LPS), which is a highly automated, computer-controlled system for assembly, checkout, and launch of the Space Shuttle. LPS monitors thousands of measurements on the Space Shuttle and its ground support equipment, compares them to predefined tolerance levels, and then displays values that are out of tolerance. <b>Firing</b> <b>Room</b> operators view the data and send commands about everything from propellant levels inside the external tank to temperatures inside the crew compartment. In many cases, LPS will automatically react to abnormal conditions and perform related functions without test engineer intervention; however, <b>firing</b> <b>room</b> engineers continue to look at each and every happening to ensure a safe launch.
