5|$|Converge {{began writing}} Axe to Fall in November 2008. With Jacob Bannon, Kurt Ballou and Nate Newton all living within {{a half a}} mile {{of each other in}} Boston, and Ben Koller living a couple hours away in Brooklyn, Converge could easily {{practice}} <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> a time. Though most songs originated from a guitar or bass riff from Ballou or Newton, all members had equal input on the writing process, with each member proposing different songs. Vocalist Bannon wrote a few songs for Axe to Fall, but were scrapped because they were slower {{than the rest of the}} songs, and did not fit the energy of the album.|$|E
5|$|Despite the unopposed {{re-election}} of Tung in July 2002, {{distrust of}} China remained throughout Tung's first term as Chief Executive. In 2003, Hong Kong was gravely {{affected by the}} outbreak of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS). The World Health Organization reported 1,755 infected and 299 deaths in Hong Kong. Economic activities slowed down and schools were closed <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> the height of SARS epidemic. An estimated 380 million Hong Kong dollars (US$48.9 million) in contracts were lost {{as a result of the}} epidemic.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, males compete {{for access to}} females. Such competition can {{take the form of}} fighting other males or of herding females to prevent access by other males. In Shark Bay, male bottlenose dolphins have been observed working in pairs or larger groups to follow and/or restrict the movement of a female <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> a time, waiting for her to become sexually receptive. These coalitions, also known as male reproductive alliances, will fight with other coalitions for control of females.|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{undertaken}} to investigate changes in five plasma enzyme activities (GPT, GOT, LDH, CPK and Al-P) {{immediately after the}} termination of physical training with different intensities, frequencies and durations. 320 young male mice were divided into an untrained and fifteen trained groups. They were exhaustively, moderately and mildly trained on the treadmill for 10 and 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> the rate of 5 and 3 days and also <b>for</b> 3 <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> the rate of 5 days per week. Results obtained were as follows. 1) In all trained groups, plasma GOT and LDH activities were not innuenced by the physical training. 2) Plasma GPT activity was significantly lower in both exhaustively and moderately trained groups <b>for</b> 10 <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> the rate of 5 and 3 days and also in exhaustively trained group <b>for</b> 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> the rate of 5 days per week than in untrained group. 3) Plasma CPK activity was significantly higher in both exhaustively and moderately trained groups <b>for</b> 10 <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> the rate of 5 and 3 days and also <b>for</b> 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> the rate of 5 days per week than in untrained group. 4) Plasma Al-P activity was significantly lower in both exhaustively and moderately trained groups <b>for</b> 10 <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> the rate of 5 days and also in exhaustively trained group <b>for</b> 10 <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> the rate of 3 days and <b>for</b> 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> the rate of 5 days per week than in untrained group.

5|$|The year 1956 was {{not very}} {{different}} from 1955 for Koufax. Despite the blazing speed of his fastball, Koufax continued to struggle with his control. He saw little work, pitching only 58.7 innings with a 4.91 ERA, 29 walks and 30 strikeouts. When Koufax allowed baserunners, he was rarely permitted to finish the inning. Teammate Joe Pignatano said that, as soon as Koufax threw a couple of balls in a row, Alston would signal for a replacement to start warming up in the bullpen. Jackie Robinson, in his final season, clashed with Alston on Koufax's usage. Robinson saw that Koufax was talented and had flashes of brilliance, and objected to Koufax being benched <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> a time.|$|E
5|$|Before {{relation}} with his later wife Gertrud Weiss, Leo Szilard's life {{partner in the}} period 1927 – 1934 was kindergarten teacher and opera singer Gerda Philipsborn, who also worked as a volunteer in a Berlin asylum organization for refugee children and in 1932 moved to India to continue in this work. Szilard married Gertrud (Trude) Weiss, a physician, in a civil ceremony in New York on October 13, 1951. They {{had known each other}} since 1929, and had frequently corresponded and visited each other ever since. Weiss took up a teaching position at the University of Colorado in April 1950, and Szilard began staying with her in Denver <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> a time when they had never been together {{for more than a few}} days before. Single people living together was frowned upon in the conservative United States at the time, and after they were discovered by one of her students, Szilard began to worry that she might lose her job. Their relationship remained a long-distance one, and they kept news of their marriage quiet. Many of his friends were shocked when they found out, as it was widely believed that Szilard was a born bachelor.|$|E
5|$|Life on {{the island}} was very {{isolated}} due to its inaccessibility. Until as late as 1894 it had no landing place, which meant that boats had to be landed directly {{on the beach and}} pulled up above the waterline. Particularly in winter, when storms raged through the Pentland Firth, Stroma could be cut off <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> a time. Such episodes posed serious risks to the islanders, as they had no doctor. The winter of 1937 illustrated the problems that the weather could pose; during January and February that year, the island was cut off for three weeks by violent gales which demolished houses along the seafront and washed boats 100 yards (90m) inland. Stroma's isolation came at an especially bad time, as most of the population had caught influenza and supplies of food dwindled to the point that some items had to be rationed. Eventually two boats were able to reach the island, carrying supplies and a doctor from Caithness, along with three weeks' worth of mail.|$|E

5|$|Wonder Stories had a {{circulation}} of about 25,000 in 1934, {{comparable to that of}} Amazing Stories, which had declined from an early peak of about 100,000. Gernsback considered issuing a reprint magazine in 1934, Wonder Stories Reprint Annual, but it never appeared. That year he experimented with other fiction magazines—Pirate Stories and High Seas Adventures—but neither was successful. Wonder Stories was also failing, and in November 1935 it started publishing bimonthly instead of monthly. Gernsback had a reputation for paying slowly and was therefore unpopular with many authors; by 1936 he was even failing to pay Laurence Manning, one of his most reliable authors. Staff were sometimes asked to delay cashing their paychecks <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> a time. Gernsback felt the blame lay with dealers who were returning magazine covers as unsold copies, and then selling the stripped copies at a reduced rate. To bypass the dealers, he made a plea in the March 1936 issue to his readers, asking them to subscribe, and proposing to distribute Wonder Stories solely by subscription. There was little response, and Gernsback decided to sell. He made a deal with Ned Pines of Beacon Magazines and on 21 February 1936 Wonder Stories was sold.|$|E
25|$|Hellyer {{trawlers}} {{stayed out}} at sea <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> a time, transferring their catch to a fleet of five fast steam cutters that commuted between the fishing grounds and the fish markets of eastern England. Viola was regularly at sea for more than 310 days a year.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Philadelphia {{businessman}} William Wurts often would leave his affairs aside <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> {{a time to}} explore the then-sparsely populated northeastern region of the state.

25|$|From the 1840s, hydropathics were {{established}} across Britain. Initially, {{many of these}} were small institutions, catering to at most dozens of patients. By the later nineteenth century the typical hydropathic establishment had evolved into a more substantial undertaking, with thousands of patients treated annually <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> a time in a large purpose-built building with lavish facilities – baths, recreation rooms and the like – {{under the supervision of}} fully trained and qualified medical practitioners and staff.|$|E
25|$|By mid January, the SS and Nazi-controlled police units {{had begun}} forcing {{thousands}} of camp prisoners from Poland, East Prussia, Silesia and Pomerania to walk westward {{away from the}} advancing Red Army. The death marches, which took place over hundreds of kilometers in sub-zero conditions without food and medicine, resulted in thousands of concentration camp prisoners and allied POWs dying on route. It is estimated that in March and April 1945 at least 250,000 {{men and women were}} marched on foot to the heartland of Germany and Austria sometimes <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> a time.|$|E
25|$|Described by her {{children}} as a no-nonsense mother, Maud {{took charge of the}} family finances and the disciplining of {{her children}}. She was their primary caretaker because her husband's business obligations frequently led to his being away <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> a time. The family moved to Aberdeen, South Dakota, in 1888 because Maud wished to be near her brother and two sisters. After her husband was unable to sustain a living there, they moved to Chicago. Because of their dire financial situation, Maud also worked, teaching embroidery and lace-making.|$|E

25|$|Both Anthony and Stanton {{joined the}} lecture circuit about 1870, usually {{traveling}} from mid-autumn to spring. The timing was right because {{the nation was}} beginning to discuss women's suffrage as a serious matter. Occasionally they traveled together but most often not. Lecture bureaus scheduled their tours and handled the travel arrangements, which generally involved traveling {{during the day and}} speaking at night, sometimes <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> a time, including weekends. Their lectures brought new recruits into the movement who strengthened suffrage organizations at the local, state and national levels. Their journeys during that decade covered a distance that was unmatched by any other reformer or politician.|$|E
25|$|The {{threat of}} America's entry into World War I had seriously {{weakened}} {{the real estate}} market, so in early 1915 Lane accepted a friend's offer of a stopgap job as an editorial assistant {{on the staff of}} the San Francisco Bulletin. The stopgap turned into a watershed. She immediately caught the attention of her editors not only through her talents as a writer in her own right, but also as a highly skilled editor for other writers. Before long, her photo and byline were running in the Bulletin daily, churning out formulaic romantic fiction serials that would run <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> a time. Lane's first-hand accounts of the lives of Henry Ford, Charlie Chaplin, Jack London, and Herbert Hoover were published in book form.|$|E
25|$|Entering the French Open, {{many were}} expecting another Nadal-Federer final. However, this became {{impossible}} when rival Robin Söderling defeated Federer in the quarterfinals. The failure of Federer {{to reach the}} semifinals allowed Nadal to regain the world No. 1 ranking {{if he were to}} win the tournament. Nadal advanced to the final and defeated Soderling. The win gave Nadal his seventh Grand Slam tournament title, tying him with John McEnroe, John Newcombe, and Mats Wilander on the all-time list, and allowed Nadal to reclaim the position of world No. 1, denying his biggest rival Roger Federer the all-time record <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> No. 1. By this win, Nadal became the first man to win the three Masters series on clay and the French Open. The victory at Roland Garros marked the second time (2008) that Nadal had won the French Open without dropping a single set (tying the record held by Björn Borg). With the win in Paris he also booked his place at the World Tour Finals in London and became the first player to win five French Open titles in six years.|$|E

25|$|Prey {{animals in}} India include chital, sambar, muntjac, mouse deer, swamp deer, wild boar, gaur, water buffalo, banteng, cattle, nilgai, goats, Indian hares, Himalayan field rats and langurs. There is one {{record of a}} pack {{bringing}} down an Indian elephant calf in Assam, despite desperate defense of the mother resulting in numerous losses to the pack. In Kashmir, they prey on markhor, and thamin in Myanmar, Malayan tapir, Sumatran serow in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula, and Javan rusa in Java. In the Tien Shan and Tarbagatai Mountains, dholes prey on Siberian ibexes, arkhar, roe deer, maral and wild boar. In the Altai and Sayan Mountains, they prey on musk deer and reindeer. In eastern Siberia, they prey on roe deer, Manchurian wapiti, wild pig, musk deer, and reindeer, while in Primorye they feed on sika deer and goral, too. In Mongolia, they prey on argali and rarely Siberian ibex. Like African wild dogs, but unlike wolves, dholes are not known to attack people. Dholes eat fruit and vegetable matter more readily than other canids. In captivity, they eat various kinds of grasses, herbs and leaves, seemingly for pleasure rather than just when ill. In summertime in the Tien Shan Mountains, dholes eat large quantities of mountain rhubarb. Although opportunistic, dholes have a seeming aversion to hunting cattle and their calves. Livestock predation by dholes {{has been a problem}} in Bhutan since the late 1990s, as domestic animals are often left outside to graze in the forest, sometimes <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> a time. Livestock stall-fed at night and grazed near homes are never attacked. Oxen are killed more often than cows, probably because they are given less protection.|$|E
500|$|In 1942 Michael Wood died {{suddenly}} of heart failure. At Adeline's behest the widowed Ursula {{was invited to}} stay with the Vaughan Williamses in Dorking, and thereafter was a regular visitor there, sometimes staying <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>at</b> a time.
