5|$|The <b>Joker</b> is {{alternatively}} {{depicted as}} sexual and asexual. In The Dark Knight Returns and Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the <b>Joker</b> is seductive toward Batman; {{it is uncertain}} if their relationship has homoerotic undertones or if the <b>Joker</b> is simply trying to manipulate his nemesis. Frank Miller interpreted the character as fixated on death and uninterested in sexual relationships, while Robinson believes that the <b>Joker</b> is capable of a romantic relationship. His relationship with Harley Quinn is abusively paradoxical; although the <b>Joker</b> keeps her at his side, he heedlessly harms her (for example, throwing her out a window without seeing if she survives). Harley loves him but the <b>Joker</b> does not reciprocate her feelings, chiding her for distracting him from other plans.|$|E
5|$|The healthy <b>Joker</b> that Talia impaled then reanimates {{into the}} shapeshifting Clayface, who is {{revealed}} {{to have been}} masquerading as a healthy <b>Joker</b> all along at the ailing villain's request. Batman defeats Clayface despite <b>Joker</b> blowing up the theater floor. Batman drinks {{a portion of the}} antidote, and destroys Ra's' rejuvenating Lazarus Pit before the <b>Joker</b> can use it. As Batman debates curing his foe, <b>Joker</b> attacks him, causing the antidote vial to inadvertently smash. Batman admits that in spite of everything <b>Joker</b> had done, he would have saved him. After <b>Joker</b> finally succumbs to his illness and dies, Batman carries his body out of Arkham City. As Commissioner Gordon asks what happened, Batman places Joker's body on the hood of a police car and leaves in silence.|$|E
5|$|Tracking the <b>Joker</b> to the Gotham Royal Hotel, Batman {{discovers that}} the villain {{and his men}} have filled the hotel with explosives, murdered the staff, and taken the guests hostage. The <b>Joker</b> berates the assassins for their failure to kill Batman, {{throwing}} Electrocutioner out a window to his death: Batman recovers his electric gloves. The assassins leave, except for Bane, who thinks Batman is coming for the <b>Joker.</b> After traversing the building, Batman finds the <b>Joker</b> on the roof but is forced to battle Bane. Thinking Batman is outmatched, Alfred alerts the police so they will intervene. As Bane escapes by helicopter, he fires a rocket at the <b>Joker,</b> who is thrown from the hotel by the concussive force. Batman saves the <b>Joker,</b> leaving him with the police. Puzzled by the events, the <b>Joker</b> is imprisoned in Blackgate {{under the care of}} Dr. Harleen Quinzel; he tells Quinzel that he and Batman were destined to meet.|$|E

He hires the <b>Joker</b> to kill Batman, but the <b>Joker</b> double-crosses him and kills him with <b>Joker</b> venom.|$|E
5|$|After announcing Gotham will {{be subject}} to his rule come nightfall, the <b>Joker</b> rigs two {{evacuating}} ferries with explosives; one containing civilians and the other containing prisoners. He says that he will blow them both up by midnight, but will let one live if its passengers (who have been supplied the trigger to the other boat's explosives) blow up the other. Batman finds the <b>Joker</b> with a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of Lucius Fox. Both the civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while Batman apprehends the <b>Joker</b> after a brief fight. Before the police arrive to take the <b>Joker</b> into custody, he gloats that Gotham's citizens will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public knowledge.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Joker</b> assaults Gotham City Hall, he {{is caught}} by Batman {{and taken to}} Arkham Asylum, which {{temporarily}} houses {{many members of the}} Joker's gang, who were transferred after a fire at Blackgate Prison. Believing the <b>Joker</b> allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the <b>Joker</b> escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The <b>Joker</b> threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The <b>Joker</b> then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The <b>Joker</b> frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets.|$|E

5|$|Batman, {{who survived}} the crash, fends off the Joker's {{remaining}} men despite his injuries, and confronts the <b>Joker.</b> The two struggle, with <b>Joker</b> eventually gaining the upper hand, leaving Batman and Vicki clinging onto an outcropping. The <b>Joker</b> tries to escape by helicopter, but Batman attaches a heavy granite gargoyle to the Joker's leg with his grappling hook, causing him to lose his grip and fall to his death after it breaks off.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{decides to}} reveal his secret identity. Before he can, however, Dent announces that he is Batman. Dent is taken into {{protective}} custody, but the <b>Joker</b> appears and attacks the convoy. Batman comes to Dent's rescue and Gordon, who faked his death, apprehends the <b>Joker,</b> securing a promotion to Commissioner. Rachel and Dent are escorted away by Michael Wuertz and Anna Ramirez, detectives on Maroni's payroll; Gordon later learns that they never arrived home. Batman interrogates the <b>Joker,</b> who reveals {{that they have been}} trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives. Batman races to save Rachel, while Gordon attempts to rescue Dent. Batman arrives at the building, but realizes that the <b>Joker</b> sent him to Dent's location instead. Both buildings explode, killing Rachel and disfiguring half of Dent's face. The <b>Joker</b> escapes the jail with Lau.|$|E
5|$|Coleman Reese, an {{accountant}} at Wayne Enterprises, deduces that Bruce is Batman {{and tries to}} go public with the information. After observing the unpredictability of the <b>Joker,</b> Maroni informs Commissioner Gordon of the Joker's location. The <b>Joker</b> sets fire to the mob's money, burning Lau alive in the process, and kills the Chechen. Not wanting Reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the <b>Joker</b> threatens to destroy a hospital unless someone kills Reese. Gordon orders the evacuation of all the hospitals in Gotham and goes to secure Reese. The <b>Joker</b> finds Dent in Gotham General and manipulates him into seeking revenge for Rachel's death on Gotham's corrupt systems. The <b>Joker</b> then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. Dent goes on a killing spree based on a coin flip and targets people he holds responsible for Rachel's death, killing Wuertz and Maroni while sparing Ramirez.|$|E
50|$|The Dollmaker {{is later}} {{found by the}} <b>Joker's</b> Daughter, who asks him to sew the <b>Joker's</b> face onto her own and inject the <b>Joker's</b> blood into her veins. The Dollmaker follows through with her request.|$|R
2500|$|The game {{is played}} with two decks, with two <b>jokers</b> per deck, giving {{a total of four}} <b>jokers.</b> The <b>jokers</b> are {{separated}} into red and black (or colloquially known as [...] "big" [...] and [...] "small" [...] respectively). Some card manufacturers will make <b>jokers</b> of the same color, which then have to be marked as [...] "red" [...] and [...] "black." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dublee {{cannot be}} formed {{by using the}} {{wildcard}} (<b>jokers</b> or maals). However two <b>jokers</b> is considered a dublee.|$|R
5|$|In the story, Booster Gold {{is charged}} by Rip Hunter {{to go back}} in time and save Barbara from being shot by the <b>Joker.</b> Booster arrives at the {{carnival}} shortly after the <b>Joker</b> has rounded up the freaks, only to be attacked by them. He manages to escape (after the <b>Joker</b> torments him), but arrives too late to save Barbara. Catching the <b>Joker</b> in the middle of taking photos of the wounded Barbara (after having struck down Commissioner Gordon), Booster attacks the <b>Joker</b> in a rage; the <b>Joker</b> nevertheless gains the upper hand, snapping several photos of Booster as well. Rip removes Booster moments before he is killed, but Booster demands to be sent back again. Booster fails several times until Rip reveals that the <b>Joker</b> is destined to paralyze her, as it would ensure that she would become Oracle. Rip did this to demonstrate to Booster that some points in time, like Barbara's paralysis, are fixed and cannot be prevented or altered, so that Booster would not continue insisting on rescuing his friend Ted Kord from death, another fixed point.|$|E
5|$|Mob bosses Sal Maroni, Gambol, and the Chechen hold a {{videoconference}} {{with their}} corrupt accountant, Lau, {{who has taken}} their funds for safekeeping and fled to Hong Kong.

After escaping and smuggling himself as a corpse, the <b>Joker</b> kills Gambol and takes over his gang. The mob ultimately decides to take the <b>Joker</b> up on his offer.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Joker</b> has {{undergone}} many revisions since his 1940 debut. The most common {{interpretation of the}} character {{is that he is}} disguised as the criminal Red Hood, and pursued by Batman. The <b>Joker</b> falls into a vat of chemicals which bleaches his skin, colors his hair green and his lips red, and drives him insane. The reasons why the <b>Joker</b> was disguised as the Red Hood, and his identity before his transformation have changed over time.|$|E
50|$|While modern decks {{of playing}} cards may contain {{one or more}} <b>Jokers</b> {{depicting}} a person (such as a jester or clown), <b>Jokers</b> are not normally considered to be face cards. The earliest <b>Jokers,</b> known as Best Bowers, did not depict people until the late 1860s.|$|R
50|$|<b>Jokers</b> are 2s - <b>Jokers</b> always {{count as}} 2s, meaning {{the number of}} Deuces in the game is increased.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Joker</b> {{possesses}} no superhuman abilities, instead {{using his}} expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions, and thematic weaponry, including razor-tipped playing cards, deadly joy buzzers, and acid-spraying lapel flowers. The <b>Joker</b> sometimes works with other Gotham City supervillains {{such as the}} Penguin and Two-Face, and groups like the Injustice Gang and Injustice League, but these relationships often collapse due to the Joker's desire for unbridled chaos. The 1990s introduced a romantic interest for the <b>Joker</b> in his former psychiatrist, Harley Quinn, who becomes his villainous sidekick. Although his primary obsession is Batman, the <b>Joker</b> has also fought other heroes including Superman and Wonder Woman.|$|E
5|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} before the <b>Joker</b> died, his infected blood was used in blood transfusions, infecting five people including Batman; Batman, concealing his infection from others, imprisoned the four other recipients who were physically and mentally transforming into the <b>Joker.</b> The <b>Joker,</b> now existing as a mental projection produced by the infected blood and fear toxin, frequently appears to taunt Batman, and manipulate his perception {{of the world around}} him. After Batman escapes the exploding Ace Chemicals, he alerts Gordon to Oracle's kidnapping, who angrily leaves to find Scarecrow.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Origins {{introduces}} a multiplayer component to the series. Invisible Predator Online revolves around a gang war in Blackgate Prison between supervillains <b>Joker</b> and Bane. Three <b>Joker</b> gang members fight three Bane gang members, {{and in turn}} the team of Batman and Robin.

A gang member can become boss (<b>Joker</b> or Bane), gaining more-powerful abilities. Gang members can access guns and explosives; Batman and Robin can access gadgets and abilities from the main game, including Detective Vision. Gang members have a limited Enhanced Vision, which requires recharging. Hunter, Hunted sets three <b>Joker</b> thugs and three Bane thugs against Batman in a last-team-standing match in which each character has one life.|$|E
50|$|If {{there is}} a trump suit in the {{upcoming}} hand and <b>jokers</b> are being used, the <b>jokers</b> become the best cards of the trump suit (better than the ace) regardless of whether high- or low-ranking cards are the winners.

The <b>Joker</b> threatens to keep killing people unless Batman reveals his identity, and starts by murdering Police Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb and the judge presiding over the mob trial. The <b>Joker</b> also tries to kill Mayor Anthony Garcia, but Gordon sacrifices himself to stop the assassination. Dent learns that Rachel is the next target.|$|E
5|$|Batman {{returns to}} the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The <b>Joker</b> announces that the {{preparations}} for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum's visitor center where the Joker's applauding henchmen welcome him. The <b>Joker</b> reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman leaps to Gordon's defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset <b>Joker</b> takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the <b>Joker</b> challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected <b>Joker</b> and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Jokerwho is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum. Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing. In a post-credits scene, a crate of Titan formula is shown floating in the ocean near the asylum when a hand surfaces and grabs it.|$|E
5|$|Director Christopher Nolan has {{mentioned}} that The Killing Joke {{served as an}} influence for the version of the <b>Joker</b> appearing in the 2008 feature film The Dark Knight.

5000|$|When the <b>jokers</b> are not namedSome decks {{of cards}} specify [...] "Big" [...] or [...] "Little" [...] on the <b>Jokers.</b> For other decks, {{you can add}} a 1 and a 2 to the index portion of the <b>Jokers</b> with a marker as well as [...] "Big" [...] and [...] "Little" [...] on their faces for ease of identification. It is very helpful to include the 1 and 2 on the indexes since typical <b>Jokers</b> have barely {{distinguishable}} icons in the corners.|$|R
