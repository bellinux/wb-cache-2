We {{describe}} {{a method for}} transforming asynchronous network protocols into protocols that can sustain any transient fault, i. e., become self-stabilizing. We combine the known notion of local checking with a new notion of <b>internal</b> <b>reset,</b> and prove that given any self-stabilizing <b>internal</b> <b>reset</b> protocol, any locally-checkable protocol can be made self-stabilizing. Our proof is constructive {{in the sense that}} we provide explicit code. The method applies to many practical network problems, including spanning tree construction, topology update, and virtual circuit setup. 1 Introduction A network protocol is called self-stabilizing (or stabilizing for sho [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two parts, the design of a {{practical}} first order open loop sigma-delta modu- lator using discrete components, and simulation of a third order OLSD ADC to investigate the consequences of circuit imperfections - and determining circuit requirements if the ADC should be used in a GSM system. The practical modulator is designed as a first order OLSD ADC, with standard discrete components such as operational amplifiers and switches, and a microcontroller with a built in ADC. The practical circuit uses surface mount capacitors with a tolerance of 20 %, resulting in poor matching and inaccurate behavior of the modulo integrator. Despite the poor matching, the OLSD ADC shows a distinct noise shaping, with a slope of about 20 dB per decade. The quantization noise is not the dominating noise source in the circuit, and the quantizer resolution must to be set to four bits or less to achieve any improvement in performance over the standard ADC. The third order modulator is modeled and simulated at a behavior level using VHDL-AMS. The ideal circuit confirms the results from the preliminary project [12], where the quantizer resolution had to be equal to or larger than the modulator order to obtain proper noise shaping. The simulations shows that the ideal third order modulator with a four bit quantizer can achieve a SNR of 88 : 51 dB, and an ENOB of 13 : 78 bits within a 200 kHz band. The third order modulator is simulated with circuit imperfections to determine the effect of these when there is no feedback present. Introducing finite gain in the integrators results in harmonic distortion at the output. This harmonic distortion is a result of leakage of the <b>internal</b> <b>reset</b> signal in the integrators. By setting the gain in all three integrators to 2 OSR = 42 dB, the SNR of the third order modulator sinks to 71 : 74 dB. The gain in the ¯rst integrator is increased to 60 dB, and the SNR raises to 84 : 52 dB. The first integrator is the most crucial to the performance of the modulator, as is the case for conventional sigma-delta ADCs. The circuit is also simulated with capacitance mismatch and comparator o®set in the modulo integrator. These two imperfections results in the same error - the output voltage from the integrator di®ers from the ideal case. Simulations show that the total voltage error should be significantly less than 0. 5 VLSB to obtain the noise shaping. If the integrator output error is too large, the noise shaping will totally disappear. In general, it has been proved that the OLSD modulator with modulo integrators works as intended, the quantization noise is shaped like in conventional sigma-delta modulators. The modulator is very sensitive to capacitor mismatch and parasitics. The e®ect of these capacitor imperfections will increase as the quantizer resolution increase, because the error will cover more units of VLSB. It is important to minimize these capacitor effects, as increased quantizer resolution will allow a greater input signal swing. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the idea of}} improving transient behavior by <b>internal</b> state <b>resetting</b> of dynamic controllers, such as controllers with integral action or adaptation. The concept presented here assumes that for a given closed loop system with a dynamic controller, improved transient performance is achieved when reset of controller states gives negative jumps in the Lyapunov function value. The Lyapunov function constitutes {{a part of the}} controller algorithm. By combining this with existing stability theory for switched systems, the stability analysis of the overall system follows directly. The framework assumes that a Lyapunov function is given, and that full state measurement is available for feedback. Moreover, an estimator is needed to give a coarse estimate of the system equilibrium point. An anti-spin feature in local thruster speed control on ships with electric propulsion is in this paper presented as an application for the given framework. Transients arise when the ship operates in extreme seas, where disturbances such as ventilation and in-and-out of water effects may give rise to loss in propeller thrust.

The release of melatonin, the hormone that triggers sleepiness, can be inhibited by even the use of computer of phone screens, which in turn can make it hard to fall asleep right away. Overall, absorbing light during the day, as opposed to night, may make a difference in falling and staying asleep. Through experimentation, red light was found to provide no effect in sleep. Blue light, on the other hand, was found to prevent or put off sleepiness at night. But, it was found that people who were exposed to natural blue light, derived from the sun and sky, during the day, had a better time sleeping at night and suffered less from depression [...] Artificial light from light bulbs or screens can change or mess up our biological clocks.

40|$|Time series-data {{accompanied}} with a sequential ordering-occur and evolve {{all around}} us. Analysing time series {{is the problem}} of trying to discern and describe a pattern in the sequential data that develops in a logical way as the series continues, and the study of sequential data has occurred for a long period across a vast array of fields, including signal processing, bioinformatics, and finance-to name but a few. Classical approaches are based on estimating the parameters of temporal evolution of the process according to an assumed model. In econometrics literature, the field is focussed on parameter estimation of linear (regression) models with a number of extensions. In this thesis, I take a Bayesian probabilistic modelling approach in discrete time, and focus on novel inference schemes. Fundamentally, Bayesian analysis replaces parameter estimates by quantifying uncertainty in the value, and probabilistic inference is used to update the uncertainty based on what is observed in practice. I make three central contributions. First, I discuss a class of latent Markov model which allows a Bayesian approach to <b>internal</b> process <b>resets,</b> and show how inference in such a model can be performed efficiently, before extending the model to a tractable class of switching time series models. Second, I show how inference in linear-Gaussian latent models can be extended to allow a Bayesian approach to variance, and develop a corresponding variance-resetting model, the heteroskedastic linear-dynamical system. Third, I turn my attention to cointegration-a headline topic in finance-and describe a novel estimation scheme implied by Bayesian analysis, which I show to be empirically superior to the classical approach. I offer example applications throughout and conclude with a discussion...|$|R
30|$|Thus with {{reference}} to Fig.  7, in general, for application of valid input data, the RCA sum and carry outputs would be produced subsequent {{to the arrival of}} the primary RCA inputs including the incoming carry. The sum outputs would indicate the arrival of all the valid primary inputs while the carry outputs may or may not depending upon whether carry-propagate or carry-generate or carry-kill condition is activated. The completion detector preceding the 2 -bit RCA, shown in Fig.  6, may provide multiple acknowledgments for the valid primary inputs supplied to the RCA. When spacer data is applied in the RTZ phase, following the RTZ of even one primary input corresponding to both the full adders in the RCA, the primary sum and carry outputs could RTZ independent of each other. Even if the remainder of the spacer inputs arrives lately, their arrival would be duly acknowledged by the completion detector preceding the asynchronous RCA, as shown in Fig.  6. Further, the sum outputs of both the full adders in the RCA could RTZ in parallel, while the <b>internal</b> carry <b>reset</b> and its propagation may or may not happen simultaneously. Moreover, the late RTZ of the internal dual-rail carry (C 11 /C 10) may also not be acknowledged. Hence, to avoid any ambiguity with respect to the RTZ of the internal carry and to avoid the potential problem of gate orphan, a relative-timing assumption is imposed for the RTZ phase that C 11 ↓ or C 10 ↓ is presumed to have happened before SUM 11 ↓ or SUM 10 ↓ happens. Note that the RTZ of the internal carry would also result in a similar RTZ of the primary sum output, i.e., the successive transitions would be monotonically decreasing (Cortadella et al. 2004). Hence the relative-timing assumption imposed does not contradict the monotonicity of the transitions.|$|R
40|$|The PCA 9551 LED blinker blinks LEDs in I 2 C-bus and SMBus {{applications}} {{where it}} is necessary to limit bus traffic or free up the I 2 C-bus master's (MCU, MPU, DSP, chip set, etc.) timer. The uniqueness of this device is the internal oscillator with two programmable blink rates. To blink LEDs using normal I/O expanders like the PCF 8574 or PCA 9554, the bus master must send repeated commands to turn the LED on and off. This greatly increases the amount of traffic on the I 2 C-bus and uses up one of the master's timers. The PCA 9551 LED blinker instead requires only the initial set-up command to program BLINK RATE 1 and BLINK RATE 2 (i. e., the frequency and duty cycle) for each individual output. From then on, only one command from the bus master is required to turn each individual open-drain output on, off, or to cycle at BLINK RATE 1 or BLINK RATE 2. Maximum output sink current is 25 mA per bit and 100 mA per package. Any bits not used for controlling the LEDs can be used for General Purpose parallel Input/Output (GPIO) expansion. The active LOW hardware reset pin (RESET) and Power-On Reset (POR) initializes the registers to their default state, all zeroes, causing the bits to be set HIGH (LED off). Three hardware address pins on the PCA 9551 allow eight devices to operate on the same bus. The newer Fast-mode Plus PCA 9634 8 -bit LED controller offers an individual PWM dimming control for each channel for better color mixing capabilities with a global PWM for dimming or blinking all channels at the same time.

40|$|It {{is known}} that muscular force is reduced in old age. We {{investigate}} what are {{the effects of this}} phenomenon on the mechanics of running. We hypothesized that the deficit in force would result in a lower push, causing reduced amplitude of the vertical oscillation, with smaller elastic energy storage and increased step frequency. To test this hypothesis, we measured the mechanical energy of the centre of mass of the body during running in old and young subjects. The amplitude of the oscillation is indeed reduced in the old subjects, resulting in an approximately 20 % smaller elastic recovery and a greater step frequency (3. 7 versus 2. 8  Hz, p= 1. 9 × 10 − 5, at 15 – 17  km h− 1). Interestingly, the greater step frequency is due to a lower aerial time, and not to a greater natural frequency of the system, which is similar in old and young subjects (3. 6 versus 3. 4  Hz, p= 0. 2). Moreover, we find that in the old subjects, the step frequency is always similar to the natural frequency, even at the highest speeds. This is at variance with young subjects who adopt a step frequency lower than the natural frequency at high speeds, to contain the aerobic energy expenditure. Finally, the external work to maintain the motion of the centre of mass is reduced in the old subjects (0. 9 versus 1. 2  J kg− 1  m− 1, p= 5. 1 × 10 − 6) due to the lower work done against gravity, but the higher step frequency involves a greater <b>internal</b> work to <b>reset</b> the limbs at each step.

40|$|We {{live in a}} {{clockwork}} universe – {{dictated by}} the particular configuration of our solar system, such as the movements of planets and gravity. The annual rotation of the Earth around the Sun is {{the primary cause of}} seasonal fluctuations in temperatures, whereas the Earth’s rotation around its axis causes daily alterations in temperature and light conditions. Other phenomena, such as tides, are influenced by the monthly revolution of the Moon around the Earth. As one complete rotation of the Earth takes 24 hours, all living organisms have adapted by evolving their own internal clockwork tuned to a 24 -hour day/night cycle to adapt their behaviour, physiology and metabolism. Circadian rhythms, as their name indicates (“circadian” comes from the Latin circa, meaning “around” and dies, meaning “a day”), are endogenous rhythms with a period of about 24 hours that regulate all aspects of the physiology of most organisms (e. g. blood pressure, body temperature, hormonal levels), behaviour (e. g. alertness, sleep cycle) and metabolism (Gachon et al., 2004; Lowrey et al., 2004; Reppert and Weaver, 2001). These <b>internal</b> clocks are <b>reset</b> to light/dark cycles and other daily external cues known as zeitgebers (German meaning time-givers), and therefore circadian rhythms are synchronized with the external environment. In mammals, the light is the major zeitgeber for circadian rhythms (Dijk et al., 1995). In rodents, circadian rhythms of wheel-running activity are presented by doubleplotted actograms (Figure 1). When environmental cues are eliminated by moving organism to constant darkness, the circadian clock is no longer reset each day and its endogenous periodicity, called free-running period, is revealed and can be determined. As light is the major zeitgeber of the circadian clock it can reset the clock in accordance with the phase response curve (PRC). The PRC illustrates the relationship between the timing and the effect of a treatment designed to affect the circadian clock. Depending on the timing, light can advance or delay the circadian rhythm. Exposure to bright light early or late in the subjective night induces phase delay or phase advance of the circadian clock, respectively (Daan and Pittendrigh, 1976) ...|$|R
