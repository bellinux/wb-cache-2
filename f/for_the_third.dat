40|$|In Bangalore, {{cancer of}} the {{oesophagus}} is <b>the</b> <b>third</b> most common cancer in males and fourth most common in females with average annual age-adjusted incidence rates of 8. 2 and 8. 9 per 100, 000 respectively.

Three hundred and forty-three cases of cancer of the oesophagus were age and sex matched with {{twice the number of}} controls from the same area, but with no evidence of cancer. Chewing with or without tobacco was a significant risk factor. In both sexes chewing was not a risk factor <b>for</b> cancer of <b>the</b> upper <b>third</b> of <b>the</b> oesophagus. Among males, non-tobacco chewing was a significant risk factor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>third</b> but not <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other two segments and tobacco chewing was a significant risk factor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>third</b> of <b>the</b> oesophagus, but not <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other two segments.

South Australia was experiencing a depression in 1886 and that coupled with a report by General James Bevan Edwards scuttled plans <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> coastal fort.
