5|$|Brazilian flex {{cars are}} capable of running on just {{hydrated}} ethanol (E100), or just on a blend of gasoline with 20 to 25%anhydrous ethanol, or on any arbitrary combination of both fuels. Pure <b>gasoline</b> <b>is</b> no longer sold in the country because these high ethanol blends are mandatory since 1993. Therefore, all Brazilian automakers have optimized flex vehicles to run with gasoline blends from E20 to E25, so these FFVs are unable to run smoothly with pure gasoline {{with the exception of}} two models are specifically built with a flex-fuel engine optimized to operate also with pure gasoline (E0), the Renault Clio Hi-Flex and the Fiat Siena Tetrafuel.|$|E

Material separated from crude oil via distillation, called virgin or straight-run gasoline, does not meet specifications for modern engines (particularly the octane rating, see below), but can be pooled to the gasoline blend.|$|E

5000|$|India: India's {{ordinary}} and premium <b>gasolines</b> <b>are</b> of 91 RON. The premium <b>gasolines</b> <b>are</b> generally ordinary fuels with additives, {{that do not}} really change the octane value. Two variants, [...] "Speed 93" [...] and [...] "Speed 97", were launched, with RON values of 93 and 97. India's economy-class vehicles usually have compression ratios under 10:1, thus enabling them to use lower-octane gasoline without engine knocking.|$|R
25|$|It is {{very common}} in Europe and Asia because those regions have high demand for diesel and kerosene. In the US, fluid {{catalytic}} cracking is more common because the demand for <b>gasoline</b> <b>is</b> higher.|$|E
25|$|Legislation {{requires}} {{retailers to}} label fuels containing ethanol on the dispenser, and limits ethanol use to 10% of gasoline in Australia. Such <b>gasoline</b> <b>is</b> commonly called E10 by major brands, {{and it is}} cheaper than regular unleaded gasoline.|$|E
25|$|The {{octane rating}} of typical commercially {{available}} gasoline varies by country. In Finland, Sweden, and Norway, 95 RON {{is the standard}} for regular unleaded gasoline and 98 RON is also available as a more expensive option. In the UK, ordinary regular unleaded <b>gasoline</b> <b>is</b> 95 RON (commonly available), premium unleaded <b>gasoline</b> <b>is</b> always 97 RON, and super unleaded is usually 97–98 RON. However, both Shell and BP produce fuel at 102 RON for cars with high-performance engines and in 2006 the supermarket chain Tesco began to sell super unleaded gasoline rated at 99 RON. In the US, octane ratings in unleaded fuels can vary between 85 and 87 AKI (91–92 RON) for regular, through 89–90 AKI (94–95 RON) for mid-grade (equivalent to European regular), up to 90–94 AKI (95–99 RON) for premium (European premium).|$|E

25|$|MTBE was {{phased out}} in the US due to ground water {{contamination}} and the resulting regulations and lawsuits. Ethanol and, to a lesser extent, the ethanol-derived ETBE are common replacements. A common ethanol-gasoline mix of 10% ethanol mixed with <b>gasoline</b> <b>is</b> called gasohol or E10, and an ethanol-gasoline mix of 85% ethanol mixed with <b>gasoline</b> <b>is</b> called E85. The most extensive use of ethanol takes place in Brazil, where the ethanol is derived from sugarcane. In 2004, over 3.4 billion US gallons (2.8billion impgal/13 million m³) of ethanol was produced in the United States for fuel use, mostly from corn, and E85 is slowly becoming available {{in much of the}} United States, though many of the relatively few stations vending E85 are not open to the general public.|$|E
25|$|Electrostatic {{discharge}} while fueling with <b>gasoline</b> <b>is</b> {{a present}} danger at gas stations.

25|$|The {{extraction}} {{and refining}} of carbon based fuels and its distribution {{is in itself}} an energy intensive industry contributing to CO2 emissions. In 2007 U.S. refineries consumed 39353 million kWh, 70769 million lbs of steam and 697593 million cubic feet of Natural Gas.

25|$|In New Zealand, <b>gasoline</b> <b>is</b> unleaded, {{and most}} {{commonly}} available in 91 RON ("Regular") and 95 RON ("Premium"). 98 RON {{is available at}} selected BP ("Ultimate") and Mobil ("Synergy 8000") service stations instead of the standard 95 RON. 96 RON was replaced by 95 RON, and subsequently abolished in 2006. Leaded fuel was abolished in 1996.|$|E
25|$|E85, {{a mixture}} of 85% ethanol and 15% <b>gasoline,</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} the highest ethanol fuel mixture found in the United States and several European countries, particularly in Sweden, as this blend is the standard fuel for flexible-fuel vehicles. This mixture has an octane rating of 94-97, which is significantly lower than pure ethanol, but still higher than normal gasoline (87-93 octane, depending on country).|$|E
25|$|Gasoline {{engines are}} used in most hybrid {{electric}} designs and will likely remain dominant for the foreseeable future. While petroleum-derived <b>gasoline</b> <b>is</b> the primary fuel, {{it is possible to}} mix in varying levels of ethanol created from renewable energy sources. Like most modern ICE powered vehicles, HEVs can typically use up to about 15% bioethanol. Manufacturers may move to flexible fuel engines, which would increase allowable ratios, but no plans are in place at present.|$|E

30|$|The {{extraction}} {{was carried}} out in the glass reactor by adding the ionic liquid to the model gasoline. The resulting mixture was stirred vigorously at 50  °C (or other specified temperatures). After a specified time, the upper phase (model <b>gasoline)</b> <b>was</b> carefully separated from the IL phase with a syringe for analysis. The total sulfur of the model <b>gasoline</b> <b>was</b> determined before and after each extraction by two methods: XRF (ASTM-D 2622) and Raney nickel method (UOP 357 – 80) for samples with total sulfur > 100 and < 100  ppm, respectively.|$|R

25|$|Although the Mr. Fusion unit {{provides}} the required {{power for the}} time machine, the DeLorean is still powered by an internal combustion engine for propulsion. The fuel line is damaged during Marty's trip to 1885 in Back to the Future Part III; after he and Doc patch it, they attempt to use whiskey as a replacement fuel since commercial <b>gasoline</b> <b>is</b> not yet available. The test fails, destroying the car's fuel injection manifold and leaving it unable to travel under its own power.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} of a particular gasoline blend to resist igniting too early (which causes knocking and reduces efficiency in reciprocating engines) is measured by its octane rating. <b>Gasoline</b> <b>is</b> produced in several grades of octane rating. Tetraethyllead and other lead compounds are no longer used in most areas to regulate and increase octane-rating, but many other additives are put into gasoline to improve its chemical stability, control corrosiveness and provide fuel system 'cleaning,' and determine performance characteristics under intended use. Sometimes, gasoline also contains ethanol as an alternative fuel, for economic, political or environmental reasons.|$|E
