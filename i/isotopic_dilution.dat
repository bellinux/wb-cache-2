The four strains similarly stored glycogen during all growth phases, and the glycogen-to-protein ratio was close to 0. 6 during the exponential growth phase. 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of [1 - 13 C]glucose utilization by resting cells of the four strains revealed a reversal of glycolysis at the triose phosphate level and the same metabolic pathways. Glycogen futile cycling was demonstrated by 13 C NMR by following the simultaneous metabolism of labeled [13 C]glycogen and exogenous unlabeled glucose. The <b>isotopic</b> <b>dilutions</b> of the CH 2 of succinate and the CH 3 of acetate when the resting cells were metabolizing [1 - 13 C]glucose and unlabeled glycogen were precisely quantified by using 13 C-filtered spin-echo difference 1 H NMR spectroscopy.

Plots under different long-term fertilizer regimes were sampled before and after NH 4 NO 3 additions, and the rates of nitrification were determined by 15 N <b>isotopic</b> pool <b>dilution</b> assays. Ammonia-oxidizing populations in the plots were quantified by competitive PCR assays based on the amoA and ribosomal 16 S genes. Prior to fertilizer addition, ammonium concentrations and nitrification rates in the plots were comparatively low; ammonia-oxidizing populations were present at 104 to 105 gene copies g of soil− 1. Three days after the application of fertilizer, nitrification rates had risen considerably but the size of the ammonia-oxidizing population was unchanged. Six weeks after fertilizer treatment, ammonium concentrations and nitrification rates had fallen while the ammonia-oxidizing populations in plots receiving fertilizer had increased. The rapidity of the rise in nitrification rates observed after 3 days suggests that it results from phenotypic changes in the ammonia-oxidizing bacterial population. Associated increases in population sizes were only observed after 6 weeks and did not correlate directly with nitrifying activity.

In humans, variants in the OB gene have not been detected and very {{little is known about the}} action of leptin on food intake and energy expenditure, although circulating leptin concentrations are positively correlated to body fat stores. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between fasting plasma leptin concentrations and energy expenditure in 123 5 -yr-old Pima Indian children (67 males/ 76 females). Body composition was assessed by <b>isotopic</b> water <b>dilution</b> (18 O) whereas total energy expenditure (TEE) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) were measured using doubly labeled water and indirect calorimetry, respectively. The physical activity level was calculated as the ratio of TEE:RMR. Plasma leptin concentrations were positively correlated to percent body fat (r = 0. 84, P < 0. 0001), but were similar in boys and girls after adjusting for percent body fat. Most importantly, we found that, independent of the percentage of body fat, plasma leptin concentrations correlated with TEE (in absolute values, r = 0. 37, P < 0. 0001, or adjusted for body size r = 0. 42; P < 0. 0001) and with physical activity level (r = 0. 26, P < 0. 01), but not RMR.

40|$|Background: Body fat mass (FM) and fat free mass (FFM) in {{childhood}} are often estimated by conversion of a measured variable into compartmental body composition using constants or regression equations {{that have been}} previously derived in healthy individuals. Application of such constants or equations to children with disease states may lead to inappropriate conclusions since the "normal'' relationships may become altered. Aims and Methods: To test this hypothesis by taking measurements of body composition using dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DEXA) as a "gold standard'' method and calculating hydration and body potassium constants using <b>isotopic</b> water <b>dilution</b> and whole body potassium counting. Measurements of bioelectrical impedance (BIA) by two different analysers (RJL and Holtain) were also performed to allow comparison with body water measurements. Results: Measurements were performed in 35 children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and compared to those in 21 children treated {{for a variety of}} other malignancies and 32 healthy sibling controls. The mean hydration and potassium content of FFM was significantly reduced in the ALL group compared to both other malignancies and controls. Application of equations derived from controls for the measurement of FFM derived from bioelectrical impedance led to an underestimation of 1. 15 kg when compared to that derived from DEXA in children treated for ALL but not in other malignancies. For all groups combined, BIA was significantly different in the two analysers.

In both cases weak hyperfine interactions were detected by HYSCORE, but the origin of these interactions was found to originate from completely different effects. In the CoTPPpy adduct, with axial coordination of the substrate (pyridine) to the metal centre, weak couplings from the pyrrole nitrogens of a neighbouring porphyrin complex were identified, and confirmed through a series of <b>isotopic</b> labelling and <b>dilution</b> experiments. This result represents the first ever identification by HYSCORE of π-π interactions between such porphyrin complexes in solution. In the [Cu(1) ]MBA adduct, again with axial coordination of the substrate (MBA) to the copper centre, weak couplings were also identified in the HYSCORE spectra, which could easily be misinterpreted as arising from inter-molecular interactions between adjacent ligands. However, the origin of these couplings was clearly demonstrated to arise from intramolecular 13 C-ligand interactions. These results demonstrate not only the sensitivity of the HYSCORE technique for detection of weak inter- and intra-molecular interactions in macrocyclic transition metal complexes, but additionally the need to consider dilution effects in the spectral assignments...|$|R
40|$|The flow {{of carbon}} (C) through soil is {{inherently}} complex {{due to the}} many thousands of different chemical transformations occurring simultaneously within the soil microbial community. The accurate modelling of this C flow therefore represents a major challenge. In response to this, isotopic tracers (e. g. 13 C, 14 C) are commonly used to experimentally parameterise models describing the fate and residence time of individual C compounds within soil. In this study, we critically evaluated the combined use of experimental 14 C labelling and mathematical modelling to estimate C turnover times in soil. We applied 14 C-labelled alanine and glucose to an agricultural soil and simultaneously measured their loss from soil solution alongside the rate of microbial C immobilization and mineralization. Our results revealed that chloroform fumigation-extraction (CFE) cannot be used to reliably quantify the amount of isotopically labelled 13 C/ 14 C immobilised by the microbial biomass. This is due to uncertainty in the extraction efficiency values (kec) within the CFE methodology which are both substrate and incubation time dependent. Further, the traditional mineralization approach (i. e. measuring 14 / 13 CO 2 evolution) provided a poor estimate of substrate loss from soil solution and mainly reflected rates of internal microbial C metabolism after substrate uptake from the soil. Therefore, while isotope addition provides a simple mechanism for labelling the microbial biomass it provides limited information on the behaviour of the substrate itself. We used our experimental data to construct a new empirical model to describe the simultaneous flow of substrate-C between key C pools in soil. This model provided a superior estimate of microbial substrate use and microbial respiration flux in comparison to traditional first order kinetic modelling approaches. We also identify a range of fundamental {{problems associated with the}} modelling of isotopic-C in soil, including issues with variation in C partitioning within the community, model pool connectivity and variation in <b>isotopic</b> pool <b>dilution,</b> which make interpretation of any C isotopic flux data difficult. We conclude that while convenient, the use of isotopic data (13 C, 14 C, 15 N) has many potential pitfalls necessitating a critical evaluation of both past and future studies...|$|R
40|$|During {{treatment}} {{of patients with}} non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, there may be marked body weight loss. Therefore, body composition should be monitored to check for a decrease in fat mass alone, without an excessive decrease of both fat-free mass and total body water. Accordingly, {{it is useful to}} monitor the hydration of these patients. One method that allows us to check the status of body hydration is the multifrequency bioelectric impedance analysis (MFBIA). It makes use of formulas that estimate total body water {{on the basis of the}} concept that the human body may be approximated to a cylinder of length equal to body height. In normal subjects body water estimates are sufficiently accurate, but in obese subjects the true hydration status may be overestimated. In this report, we describe the accuracy of mathematical models previously described in the literature, and correct for the overestimation of total body water in obese subjects by means of a new equation based on a new model. The coefficients for each model have been recalculated by the weighing of our sample in order to test the accuracy of estimates obtained with the equations. This new model includes both body volume and two impedances at appropriate frequencies useful for identifying two terms strictly related to extra- and intra-cellular water. The new formulas do not include body weight, but they include the body volume, a parameter more closely related to the biophysical reference model. Fifty-five overweight females, body mass index ranging from 26. 8 to 50. 2 kg/m 2, were enrolled in the study. The proposed equations, taking advantage of two impedance values at appropriate frequencies, better predict total body water in obese women. This was particularly evident when the results obtained with the multifrequency bioelectric impedance analysis and deuterium <b>isotopic</b> oxide <b>dilution</b> method were compared. Although this last method is considered the "gold standard," it is not suitable for use in routine clinical practice. In conclusion, evaluation of total body composition by means of bioelectric impedance analysis might be included in programs for the prevention of non-insulin-dependent diabetes and for monitoring weight loss during overt pathology...|$|R

To validate the technique, the worms were first exposed to various 65 Zn levels, and errors due to soil entrained in the gut were evaluated.

Protein turnover, {{the balance between}} protein synthesis and degradation, is {{an important aspect of}} the regulation of cellular processes for organisms as they respond to developmental or environmental cues. How proteome turnover will be influenced in plants when exposed to abiotic stress, especially moderately high temperature, has not been studied systematically. The study of protein turnover in plants, contrary to that of rapidly growing unicellular organismal cultures, is made more complicated by the high degree of amino acid recycling, which results in significant transient isotope incorporation distributions that must be dealt with computationally for high throughput analysis to be practical. In this study, an algorithm implemented in the statistical programing language R, ProteinTurnover, was developed to calculate protein turnover with transient stable isotope incorporation distributions in a high-throughput automated manner using high resolution mass spectrometry and proteomic analysis of stable isotopically labeled plant material. ProteinTurnover extracts isotopic distribution information for peptides identified by tandem MS from raw MS datasets of either <b>isotopic</b> label <b>dilution</b> or incorporation experiments. Variable isotopic distributions were modeled by maximum likelihood estimation using binomial or beta-binomial distributions to (1) unlabeled, (2) newly-synthesized (partially-labled) and (3) fully-labeled peptide distributions. The distribution abundance proportions of old to newly synthesized peptide distributions were calculated using quantities derived from the models. Half-lives and turnover rates were calculated by fitting the change in the distribution abundance prorportions over time to a first-order decay function using non-linear regression. Using ProteinTurnover, turnover rates of hundreds of proteins were measured in soluble, organellar, and microsomal fractions of Arabidopsis seedling roots, using isotopic incorporation. In a second study, ProteinTurnover was used to measure changes in proteome turnover in soluble, organelle, and microsomal fraction of Arabidopsis seedling shoots or roots comparing 22 °C and 30 °C growth conditions. A total of 571 proteins as exhibiting significant changes in turnover rate in response to elevated temperature were identified in Arabidopsis seedling tissues. In general, soluble proteins extracted from root tissue displayed relatively smaller changes in turnover. Proteins involved in photorespiration, protein folding, stress response, secondary metabolism, and redox signaling pathways exhibited the greatest changes in turnover under heat stress...|$|R

We used artificially aged samples to evaluate aging and pH effects on lability of WTR-immobilized P. Artificial aging was achieved through incubation at elevated temperatures (46 or 70 C) for 4. 5 yr, and through repeated wetting and drying for 2 yr. Using a modified <b>isotopic</b> (32 P) <b>dilution</b> technique, coupled with a stepwise acidification procedure, we monitored changes in labile P concentra-tions over time. This technique enabled evaluation {{of the effect of}} pH on the lability of WTR-immobilized P. Within the pH range of 4 to 7, WTR amendment, coupled with artificial aging, ultimately reduced labile P concentrations by $ 75 % relative to the control (no-WTR) samples. Soil samples with different physicochemical properties from two 7. 5 -yr-old, one-time WTR-amended field sites were utilized to validate the trends observed with the artificially aged samples. Despite the differences in physicochemical properties among the three (two field-aged and one artificially aged) soil samples, similar trends of aging and pH effects on lability of WTR-immobilized P were ob-served. Labile P concentrations of the WTR-amended field-aged sam-ples of the two sites decreased 6 mo after WTR amendment and the reduction persisted for 7. 5 yr, ultimately resulting in $ 70 % reduction, compared to the control plots. We conclude that WTR application is capable of reducing labile P concentration in P-impacted soils, doing so for a long time, and that within the commonly encountered range of pH values for agricultural soils WTR-immobilized P should be stable.

Five substrates and the final product in this sequence were shown to be native by the <b>isotopic</b> <b>dilution</b> of 17 - 13 C, 3 H-labeled substrates added as internal standards to extracts obtained from elongating internodes. Evidence for the <b>isotopic</b> <b>dilution</b> was obtained by KRI and full-scan capillary GC-MS. Thus, we document the presence in young maize shoots of the metabolic steps, ent-kaurene → ent-kaurenol → ent-kaurenal → ent-kaurenoic acid → ent- 7 α-hydroxykaurenoic acid → gibberellin A 12 -aldehyde...|$|E
40|$|The unique {{biology of}} a {{neoplasm}} is reflected by its distinct molecular profile compared with normal tissue. To understand tumor development better, we have undertaken a quantitative proteomic search for abnormally expressed proteins in colonic tumors from ApcMin/+ (Min) mice. By raising pairs of Min and wild-type mice on diets derived from natural-abundance or 15 N-labeled algae, we used metabolic labeling to compare protein levels in colonic tumor versus normal tissue. Because metabolic labeling allows internal control throughout sample preparation and analysis, technical error is minimized {{as compared with}} in vitro labeling. Several proteins displayed altered expression, and a subset was validated via stable <b>isotopic</b> <b>dilution</b> using synthetic peptide standards. We also compared gene and protein expression among tumor and nontumor tissue, revealing limited correlation. This divergence was especially pronounced for species showing biological change, highlighting the complementary perspectives provided by transcriptomics and proteomics. Our work demonstrates the power of metabolic labeling combined with stable <b>isotopic</b> <b>dilution</b> as an integrated strategy for the identification and validation of differentially expressed proteins using rodent models of human disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{changes in}} soil {{chemistry}} following submergence of a soil for rice production result in zinc (Zn) being immobilized in very insoluble forms. Consequently, Zn deficiency is widespread in rice crops and in human populations that subsist on rice. We explored {{the use of}} stable <b>isotopic</b> <b>dilution</b> assays for assessing Zn dynamics in submerged paddy soil with two types of strongly Zn-deficient soil for rice cultivation in the Philippines. We optimized the isotope enrichment, electrolyte and equilibration time to measure isotopically-exchangeable Zn (E-values) without changing redox conditions. Available Zn was rapidly and strongly immobilized following submergence, which was controlled by CO 2 accumulation. Addition of the isotopic tracer before submergence produced unreliable E-values because irreversible immobilization of the tracer progressed faster than isotopic exchange. Addition of the tracer to already reduced soil produced stable E-values for tracer–soil contact of up to 1 [*]week. Longer periods produced unreliable E-values because of continuing irreversible fixation of the tracer. We discuss the implications for applications of <b>isotopic</b> <b>dilution</b> methods to measure trace-element dynamics in submerged soil...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of vibrational excitons in liquid benzene {{has been tested}} by the method of <b>isotopic</b> <b>dilution.</b> A C 6 H 6 /C 6 D 6 concentration study on the infrared and Raman fundamental modes reveals that the umbrella (A 2 u) vibrational exciton in solid benzene retains its characteristics upon melting and at room temperature. The total liquid exciton bandwidth is about 40 cm− 1, practically {{the same as in}} the solid. This indicates an instantaneous local liquid structure {{similar to that of the}} solid (the Ci crystal site symmetry is also nearly preserved), in general agreement with indications from other methods. The fastest nearest neighbor vibrational resonant transfer takes about 1 psec. The residual linewidth at <b>isotopic</b> <b>dilution</b> is 3 – 4 cm− 1, which is due to inhomogeneous and/or homogeneous broadening. The respective overall reorientational and/or translational relaxation takes about 2 psec or longer. The exciton linewidth is proportional to the square root of the isotopic concentration except for a sudden break at some critical concentration...|$|E
40|$|Background Proteins {{in human}} tissues and body fluids {{continually}} undergo spontaneous oxidation and glycation reactions forming {{low levels of}} oxidation and glycation adduct residues. Proteolysis of oxidised and glycated proteins releases oxidised and glycated amino acids which, if they cannot be repaired, are excreted in urine. Scope of Review In this review we give a brief background to the classification, formation and processing of oxidised and glycated proteins in the clinical setting. We then describe the application of stable <b>isotopic</b> <b>dilution</b> analysis liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for measurement of oxidative and glycation damage to proteins in clinical studies, sources of error in pre-analytic processing, corroboration with other techniques – including how this may be improved – and a systems approach to protein damage analysis for improved surety of analyte estimations. Major conclusions Stable <b>isotopic</b> <b>dilution</b> analysis LC-MS/MS provides a robust reference method for measurement of protein oxidation and glycation adducts. Optimised pre-analytic processing of samples and LC-MS/MS analysis procedures are required to achieve this. General significance Quantitative measurement of protein oxidation and glycation adducts provides information on level of exposure to potentially damaging protein modifications, protein inactivation in ageing and disease, metabolic control, protein turnover, renal function {{and other aspects of}} body function. Reliable and clinically assessable analysis is required for translation of measurement to clinical diagnostic use. Stable <b>isotopic</b> <b>dilution</b> analysis LC-MS/MS provides a “gold standard” approach and reference methodology to which other higher throughput methods such as immunoassay and indirect methods are preferably corroborated by researchers and those commercialising diagnostic kits and reagents.

40|$|Available online 7 February 2006. In {{this study}} <b>isotopic</b> <b>dilution</b> methods {{were used to}} {{investigate}} the hypothesis that access to metals associated with specific chemical components in the soil that are not available to non-accumulator species could be involved in hyperaccumulation. The hyperaccumulator Thlaspi caerulescens and a non-accumulator species, Brassica napus, were grown in Cd and Zn enriched soil components calcite, goethite, charcoal and cryptomelane. The metal enriched components were aged to allow transformation of a proportion of added metals to non-labile forms. Results from the <b>isotopic</b> <b>dilution</b> L value method showed that despite taking up more metals, T. caerulescens accessed the same pool of metals as B. napus. Hence differential access to different solid-phase pools of metals {{appears to be an}} unlikely mechanism underlying metal hyperaccumulation. For all components except charcoal, L values for Cd and Zn were greater than the corresponding E values suggesting that E values may tend to underestimate the bioavailable fraction of metals in soils. Thlaspi caerulescens takes up more Cd and Zn than Brassica napus but from the same pools. Daniel Hammer, Catherine Keller, Michael J. McLaughlin and Rebecca E. Hamon[URL]...|$|E

40|$|The United States is {{considering}} {{the disposal of}} excess uranium- 233 (233 U), which is a weapons-usable, alpha-emitter with many properties {{similar to those of}} plutonium (Pu). Seven processing options were identified to convert the 233 U into a form acceptable for disposal into the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Processing is required to meet two WIPP waste acceptance criteria (WAC) : (a) criticality control and (b) safeguards. There are multiple approaches to meet these criteria. Uranium- 233 can be converted to non-weapons-usable 233 U by mass dilution with transuranic waste (TRUW) or by isotopically diluting the 233 U with 238 U (< 12 wt % 233 U in 238 U). Uranium- 233 can be made critically safe by the limiting fissile mass per drum, adding gadolinium, or isotopically diluting 233 U with 238 U (< 0. 66 wt % in 238 U). The <b>isotopic</b> <b>dilution</b> options would require changes in the current WAC. <b>Isotopic</b> <b>dilution</b> techniques were not considered when the WIPP WAC was originally developed because the expected concentrations of 233 U in waste streams at that time were very low. There are also legal uncertainties. WIPP accepts only defense-related TRUW. Some-but not necessarily all-of the 233 U contains sufficient plutonium such as to be considered TRUW if it were declared waste...|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} several {{checks on}} the underlying assumptions and {{procedures of the}} thymidine technique applied to stream bed sediments. Bacterial production rates were not altered when sediments were mixed to form a slurry. Incubation temperature did affect production rates. Controls fixed and washed with formaldehyde had lower backgrounds than trichloroacetic acid controls. DNA extraction by base hydrolysis was incomplete and variable at 25 °C, but hydrolysis at 120 °C extracted 100 % of the DNA, of which 84 % was recovered upon precipitation. Production rates increased as thymidine concentrations were increased over 3 orders of magnitude (30 nM to 53 μM thymidine). However, over narrower concentration ranges, thymidine incorporation into DNA was independent of thymidine concentration. Elevated exogenous thymidine concentrations did not eliminate de novo synthesis. Transport of thymidine into bacterial cells occurred at least 5 to 20 times faster than incorporation of label into DNA. We found good agreement between production rates of bacterial cultures based upon increases in cell numbers and estimates based upon thymidine incorporation and amount of DNA per cell. Those comparisons {{emphasized the importance of}} <b>isotopic</b> <b>dilution</b> measurements and validated the use of the reciprocal plot technique for estimating <b>isotopic</b> <b>dilution.</b> Nevertheless, the thymidine technique cannot be considered a routine assay and the inability to measure the cellular DNA content in benthic communities restricts the accuracy of the method in those habitats...|$|E
