50|$|Air-sea rescue {{by flying}} boat or {{floatplane}} {{was the first}} method used to pick up aviators or sailors who were struggling in the water. Any other aircraft design had the additional danger of ditching {{in the water and}} requiring immediate rescue, but seaplanes could land on the water in an emergency and wait for rescue. Long range, endurance, and the ability to stay on station {{for long periods of time}} were seen as essential to naval aviation requirements for rescue aircraft. Robust radio equipment was necessary for contact with land and ocean surface forces. Training and weather accidents could require an aircrew to be rescued, and seaplanes were occasionally used for that purpose. The limitation was that if the water's surface were too rough, the aircraft would not be able to land. The most that could be done was to <b>drop</b> <b>emergency</b> supplies to the survivors, or to signal surface ships or rescue boats to guide them to the correct location.

40|$|Active Queue Management (AQM) is {{proposed}} {{as a solution}} for providing available and dependable service to traffic from emergency users after disasters.

It can provide low loss to <b>emergency</b> packets while <b>dropping</b> non-emergency packets only as much as necessary. Fluid flow analysis and simulation is conducted to provide guidelines for proper MAMT design, especially regarding the queue size and averaging parameters that are most important. This work considers non-responsive traffic exclusively, since non-responsive traffic types are currently getting the most attention from emergency management organizations. Plus, very little work has been performed regarding AQM and non-responsive traffic. It demonstrates queue oscillation problems that previously may have been attributed to the interactions between TCP and AQM, but which are actually inherent to AQM and can be greatly reduced with proper parameter settings. MAMT is shown to perform well over a range of loads and can effectively protect emergency traffic from surges in non-emergency traffic.

40|$|Our {{target is}} to develop {{computational}} techniques for studying aerodynamic interactions between multiple objects with emphasis on studying the fluid mechanics and dynamics of an object exiting and separating from an aircraft. The object could be a paratrooper jumping out of a transport aircraft or a package of <b>emergency</b> aid <b>dropped</b> from a cargo plane. These are applications with major practical significance, and what I learn and what I develop can make {{a major impact on}} this technology area. In all these cases, the computational challenge is to predict the dynamic behavior and path of the object, so that the separation process is safe and effective. This is a very complex problem because it has an unsteady, three-dimensional nature and requires the solution of complex equations that govern the fluid dynamics of the object and the aircraft together, with their relative positions changing in time. The gravitational and aerodynamic forces acting on the object determine its dynamics and path. Sometimes those aerodynamic forces are not properly computed due to excessively thick numerical boundary layers (numerical meaning unphysical and unreal). Methods for reducing this thickness are presented here. The aerodynamic forces heavily depend on the unsteady flow field around the aircraft. The computational tools I am developing are based on the simultaneous solution of the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations governing the airflow around the aircraft and the separating object, as well as the equations governing the motion of that object. These computational methods include suitable mesh update techniques that are essential for simulations with my core computational technique [...] -the Deforming-Spatial-Domain/Stabilized Space-Time (DSD/SST) formulation. In the research I present here, I focus on developing mesh update methods that help me perform my computations with more numerical accuracy and better computational efficiency.

Methods: We identified a cohort of 255 low-income, uninsured patients who had used inpatient or emergency department services more than 6 times in the previous 12 months. Between July 2010 and June 2011 we enrolled 36 of these high-risk patients {{to participate in a}} twice-weekly drop-in group medical appointment staffed by an interdisciplinary team of a family physician, behavioral health pro-fessional, and nurse case manager.

Results: <b>Emergency</b> department use <b>dropped</b> from a rate of 0. 58 per patient per month to 0. 23 (P <. 001), and hospital charges dropped from $ 1167 per patient per month to $ 230 (P <. 001).

Previously, Seaton House banned alcohol forcing many homeless alcoholics {{to stay on the}} street using unsafe sources of liquor such as rubbing alcohol, cleaners, and industrial products. Under the new [...] "managed alcohol" [...] policy, alcohol-dependent clients enrolled in the program are served one five-ounce pour of wine every 90 minutes until it is determined that an individual is too inebriated, at which point he is denied another drink. The clients have been found to gradually reduce their intake under this regime and many have quit entirely. The 110 beds in the annex are reserved for homeless chronic alcoholics. According to Dr. Tomislav Svoboda, a family physician attached to the program, it was opened {{as a result of the}} outcry that followed the deaths of three homeless alcoholics in the winter of 1995. Up until that time, welfare regulations prohibited alcoholics from receiving benefits. According to Svoboda, [...] "The poor in Toronto essentially lived in prohibition. Many individuals were forced to make a decision between shelter and use of a substance." [...] A coroner's inquest into the three deaths recommended the creation of a wet shelter. Following the introduction of the program, a study, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal in 2006 found that serving chronic street alcoholics controlled doses of alcohol also reduced their overall alcohol consumption. Researchers found that program participants cut their alcohol use from an average of 48 drinks a day when they entered the program to an average of 8 drinks and that their trips to hospital <b>emergency</b> rooms <b>drop</b> to an average of eight a month from 13.5 while encounters with the police fall to an average of 8.8 from 18.1.As of 2016, Seaton House is one of only two homeless shelters in Toronto that has Naloxone on site and staff are trained to administer it in the event that someone overdoses. this is a life-saving initiative.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: A {{decline in}} {{surgical}} deaths {{has been observed}} in Australia since {{the introduction of the}} Australian and New Zealand Audit of Surgical Mortality (ANZASM). The current study was conducted to determine whether the perioperative mortality rate (POMR) has also declined. METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of the POMR for surgical procedures in Australian public hospitals between July 2009 and June 2013, using data obtained from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Operative procedures contained in the Australian Refined Diagnosis Related Groups were selected and the POMR was modelled using urgency of admission, age and gender as explanatory covariates. RESULTS: The POMR in Australian public hospitals reduced by 15. 4  % over the 4 -year period. The <b>emergency</b> admissions POMR <b>dropped</b> from 1. 40 to 1. 12  %, and the elective admissions POMR from 0. 09 to 0. 08  %. The binary logistic regression model used to predict patient mortality showed emergency admissions to have a higher POMR than elective, being more evident at older ages. For emergency admissions, the difference in POMR between females and males increased with age, from about 55  years onwards, with females being lower. For elective surgeries, the difference between males and females was of little practical importance across ages. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in the POMR in Australia confirms the reduction in surgical deaths reported to ANZASM. Continuing to monitor POMR will be important to ensure the safest surgery in Australia. Further investigations into case-mix will allow better risk adjustment and comparison between regions and time-periods, to facilitate continuous quality improvement...|$|R
