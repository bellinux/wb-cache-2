50|$|One {{example of}} how merozygotes can be formed is the {{transfer}} of genetic materialof an <b>Hfr</b> <b>cell</b> to an F- cell through conjugation. When an <b>Hfr</b> <b>cell</b> mates with an F- cell, the chromosome acts as a rolling circle transferring a part of its genomic chromosome across a conjugation bridge. The origin is the first bit of the DNA to be injected, while the F-factor is the last. Very rarely the whole portion of the DNA (from the origin through the F-factor) will be transferred, resulting in a very low chance of passing on the F factor to the F- cell. After conjugation, the F- cell will contain {{a part of the}} Hfr chromosome, the exogenote, as well as its own genomic chromosome, the endogenote. At this stage the cell is called a merozygote. This temporary partial diploid state may lead to recombination between the corresponding portions of the DNA, so that the genetic material of the donor may be incorporated into the chromosome of the recipient, thereby altering the genotype of the recipient. However, if no recombination occurs, the linear fragment of donor DNA in the recipient cytoplasm will be lost after one cycle. These merozygotes help to study dominance variation and mutation can be known.|$|E
50|$|A {{high-frequency}} recombination cell (<b>Hfr</b> <b>cell)</b> (also {{called an}} Hfr strain) is a bacterium with a conjugative plasmid (for example, the F-factor) integrated into its chromosomal DNA. The {{integration of the}} plasmid into the cell's chromosome is through homologous recombination. A conjugative plasmid capable of chromosome integration is also called an episome (a segment of DNA that can exist as a plasmid or become integrated into the chromosome). When conjugation occurs, Hfr cells are very efficient in delivering chromosomal genes of the cell into recipient F− cells, which lack the episome.|$|E
5000|$|Zygotic {{induction}} {{was discovered}} while {{the location of}} prophage λ was being mapped using Hfr x F− matings. When the F− was lysogenic for λ, lysogeny was mapped to the gal locus. However, when the Hfr parent was lysogenic, lysogeny (i.e., the prophage) was not inherited by any of recombinants, which were recovered by growing them as colonies on the appropriate agar medium. The reason is that transfer of the λ prophage into the F− recipient was accompanied by immediate induction of bacteriophage production within the F− cell. Subsequent lysis of this [...] "zygote" [...] released the new bacteriophage particles. If mating terminated before the prophage was transferred, phage was not produced, and recombination proceeded in the zygote. These observations provided evidence that genetic markers was transferred in one direction during conjugation, from the Hfr to F− cell. These experiments also showed that Lederberg's model was incorrect since zygotic induction would have prevented any recombinant from forming had all of the chromosome from the <b>Hfr</b> <b>cell</b> were {{to be transferred to}} the F− cell.|$|E

The buoyant density of DNA transferred from unirradiated and irradiated <b>Hfr</b> <b>cells</b> was equivalent to that of double-stranded DNA. Mating-dependent DNA synthesis in the recipient has been measured by mating <b>Hfr</b> <b>cells</b> deficient in thymidine kinase with irradiated thymine-requiring F− cells {{in the presence of}} 3 H-thymine. The extent of such DNA synthesis approximated the amount of DNA transferred from unirradiated donors.

40|$|Two hundred {{strains of}} Escherichia coli {{harboring}} Filv+ plasmids which carry {{a segment of}} the Salmonella typhimurium chromosome were isolated independently. Among them, two strains were found to harbor F' plasmids that are able to replicate in <b>Hfr</b> <b>cells</b> of E. coli; i. e., they carry a site designated poh (permissive on Hfr) of the S. typhimurium chromosome. The poh site is presumably identical with the replication origin (oriC) of the bacterial chromosome. These two plasmids carry the dnaA-uncA-rbs-ilv-cya-metE region of the chromosome of S. typhimurium. Other F' plasmids which only carried the ilv-cya-metE region were unable to be maintained in <b>Hfr</b> <b>cells.</b> The poh site (= oriC) of S. typhimurium thus is located in the uhp-ilv region of the chromosome. The two plasmids carrying the poh site of S. typhimurium can suppress the temperature-sensitive character of an E. coli mutant that carries the temperature-sensitive dnaA 46 allele, when the plasmids exist in the mutant cells. This suggests that the dnaA chromosome in place of the dnaA gene product of E. coli itself.

40|$|We have {{identified}} two chromosomal genes of Escherichia coli K 12 {{that are required}} {{for the expression of}} conjugative plasmid functions in the presence of normal plasmid DNA. <b>Hfr</b> <b>cells</b> with mutations in both of these genes are resistant to donor-specific bacteriophage and defective as conjugal donors. These characteristics {{can be attributed to the}} inability of mutant <b>Hfr</b> <b>cells</b> to elaborate F-pili, surface organelles required both for conjugal donor ability and for sensitivity to donor-specific bacteriophages. Mutant cells are also defective in surface exclusion, the property of donor cells to act as poor conjugal recipients. This defect can be attributed in part to a reduction in the amount of the F-plasmid traT gene product in the outer membrane of mutant cells; this protein is one of two plasmid gene products required for the full expression of surface exclusion.

5000|$|... == Transfer of {{bacterial}} chromosome by Hfr cells == An <b>Hfr</b> <b>cell</b> can transfer {{a portion of}} the bacterial genome. Despite being integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the bacteria, the F factor of Hfr cells can still initiate conjugative transfer, without being excised from the bacterial chromosome first. Due to the F factor's inherent tendency to transfer itself during conjugation, the rest of the bacterial genome is dragged along with it. Therefore, unlike a normal F+ cell, Hfr strains will attempt to transfer their entire DNA through the mating bridge, in a fashion similar to the normal conjugation. Interestingly, in a typical conjugation, the recipient cell also becomes F+ after conjugation as it receives an entire copy of the F factor plasmid; {{but this is not the}} case in conjugation mediated by Hfr cells. Due to the large size {{of bacterial}} chromosome, it is very rare for the entire chromosome to be transferred into the F − cell as time required is simply too long for the cells to maintain their physical contact. Therefore, as the conjugative transfer is not complete (the circular nature of plasmid and bacterial chromosome requires complete transfer for the F factor to be transferred as it may be cut in the middle), the recipient − cells do not receive the complete F factor sequence, and do not become F + due to its inability to form a sex pilus.|$|E
40|$|In this {{communication}} {{we describe}} the events occurring during the injection step in the infection of Escherichia coli Hfr cells with the RNA bacteriophage f 2. The phage RNA is partially injected into the F-pilus of the <b>Hfr</b> <b>cell.</b> This step {{was found to be}} necessary for f 2 RNA to block the penetration of the DNA phage fI. A cold sensitive mutant of f 2 is described. It is able to inject its RNA at 4 I ° but not at 3 I°. After contact is made between the phage RNA and the F-pilus, the coat protein of the phage desorbs from the F-pilus as an empty shell, leaving the RNA free to enter the cell. In the absence of divalent metals, however, the phage RNA is unable to leave the shell. When the shell desorbs from the F-pilus, the RNA remains inside in a ribonuclease sensitive state. A small fraction of the RNA in cultures depleted of divalent metal ions remains bound to the cell. It is sensitive to ribonuclease and is removed from the cell by treatments which remove F-pili...|$|E
40|$|A {{specific}} action of {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) on the sex (F) factor in the integrated state of Escherichia coli K- 12 Hfr H strain is reported. Growth of <b>Hfr</b> <b>cells</b> in Penassay Broth containing SDS results in the elimination of part {{or all of the}} F factor, yielding low and nonfertile variants of defective Hfr type and F+ cells and also F− derivatives. Appearance of such variants was generally observed after the culture reached stationary phase. The frequencies of F− cells then increased. F− cells were usually isolated as the major population among survivors. Some defective variants of <b>Hfr</b> <b>cells</b> with an intermediate fertility between standard <b>Hfr</b> and F+ <b>cells</b> had lost sensitivity toward the male-specific ribonucleic acid phage M 12. Other defective Hfr variants with as much or less fertility than standard F+ cells had also all lost sensitivity to phage M 12. On single-colony isolation, they segregated nonfertile female H cells which, when infected with F, could restore high fertility with oriented transfer of the chromosome {{the same as that of}} the original Hfr H. Also, sensitivity to phage M 12 was regained. Female H cells were characterized as those lacking fertility but still retaining a small segment of F or sfa locus at the original part of the chromosome, where newly infected F could attach.

50|$|A {{cell culture}} that {{contains}} in its population cells with non-integrated F-plasmids usually {{also contains a}} few cells that have accidentally integrated their plasmids. It is these cells {{that are responsible for}} the low-frequency chromosomal gene transfers that occur in such cultures. Some strains of bacteria with an integrated F-plasmid can be isolated and grown in pure culture. Because such strains transfer chromosomal genes very efficiently they are called Hfr (high frequency of recombination). The E. coli genome was originally mapped by interrupted mating experiments in which various <b>Hfr</b> <b>cells</b> in the process of conjugation were sheared from recipients after less than 100 minutes (initially using a Waring blender).

We have found that one such Hfr has retained the genetic duplication as well as the recombination proficiency of the parental F′ strain; to account for the failure of recombination to detach the episome in this Hfr, we have postulated the inversion of one of the duplicated regions.

40|$|When F− {{cells are}} mixed with an excess of <b>Hfr</b> <b>cells</b> there is a lethal event which results in a {{decrease}} in the number of F− survivors. We have described and discussed the parameters affecting this phenomenon of lethal zygosis, and these include the cultural conditions of both donor and recipient cells prior to mixing and the use of aeration throughout the period of the experiment. The absence of lethal zygosis with filtrates and supernatant fluids from donors suggests a dependence on direct cell-cell contact as found in conjugation. The phenomenon, which is normally observed in liquid media, also occurs on solid media, and use of these two methods has allowed examination of strains of different mating types. Whereas most Hfr strains capable of producing normal yields of recombinants showed killing activity, no F+ and only one F′ donor produced lethal zygosis. Only F− strains were sensitive to this phenomenon. The relationship between lethal zygosis and the various stages of conjugation is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Hfr {{strains of}} Escherichia coli K- 12 were found capable of {{accepting}} a F′lac episome during mating, with a frequency approximating that of F− strains.

Rates of enzyme synthesis were approximately constant with respect to time as expected from unilinear inheritance of the F′lac episome.

50|$|In {{conjugation}} {{mediated by}} <b>Hfr</b> <b>cells,</b> transfer of DNA {{starts at the}} origin of transfer (oriT) located within the F factor and then continues clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the orientation of F factor in the chromosome.

This results in sequential transfer of genes on the bacterial chromosome. Bacterial geneticists make use of this principle to map the genes on the bacterial chromosome. This technique is called interrupted mating as geneticists allow conjugation to take place for different periods of time before stopping conjugation with a high-speed blender. By using Hfr and F− strains with one strain carrying mutations in several genes, each affecting a metabolic function or causing antibiotic resistance, and examining the phenotype of the recipient cells on selective agar plates, one can deduce which genes are transferred into the recipient cells first and therefore are closer to the oriT sequence on the chromosome.|$|R

Among 50 clones of PCR products that have been sequenced, over half have identity with bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2).

An analysis of the kinetics of zygote formation revealed that chromosomal markers began to be transferred from F′ strains 8 to 10 min later than from their analogous Hfr strains. The rate of chromosome transfer is the same from both F′ and Hfr strains, and the difference observed in kinetic experiments was shown not to be due to any difference between the sequence of chromosomal genes in the F′ and Hfr strains. F′ strains and Hfr strains showed no difference in ability to form specific pairs with female recipients shortly after mixing.

Uninfected cells that appeared were M 13 sensitive. Hfr and F' males were also transferred serially at high cell densities (10 (7) to 10 (9) /ml), where high levels of phage should permit reinfection. The proportion of phage-producing cells in the cultures remained constant for 7 to 15 generations and then dropped exponentially on further growth. Non-phage-producing cells appearing in the culture were refractory to infection by M 13; in some cases cells scored as non-phage producers for 20 generations were observed to produce phage on further growth in liquid culture. F'trp+ males infected with M 13 lost trp+ function almost immediately; this was not regained in these experiments. Infected cells grown in dilute culture or on plates remained infected longer, produced more PFU per cell for a longer period, and retained trp+ function in F'trp+ males for over 90 generations.

The Ra- 1 and Ra- 2 strains are Hfr strains whose origins are widely separated on the chromosome and whose transfer modes proceed in the opposite direction from one another. When Ra- 1 cells were mated with females, {{a small fraction of the}} donors transferred markers via the Ra- 2 mode. This effect was enhanced by preconjugal ultraviolet (UV) treatment of the Ra- 1 cells. Among the survivors of UV-treated Ra- 1 cells, a few stable Ra- 2 cells were found. When Ra- 2 cells were used as the donors, some of them were found to mate via the Ra- 1 mode, in analogy with the Ra- 1 to Ra- 2 alteration with inversion of F mentioned above. Related experiments suggested that the inversion occurs by detachment of the F factor from one Hfr origin locus, followed by reassociation of the F factor with the other Hfr origin locus. Both the Ra- 1 and Ra- 2 strains reverted spontaneously to an F+ strain, called RaF+. Cultures of RaF+ cells were found to mate primarily according to the Ra- 1 and Ra- 2 transfer modes, with smaller contributions also coming from transfer modes with origins elsewhere on the chromosome in a way which is similar to the transfer of markers from a normal F+ strain. The RaF+ sex factor was found to be wild type, whereas the chromosome was found to carry irregularities (sex factor affinity loci) at the locations of the Ra- 1 and Ra- 2 origins.

Since these characteristics were sensitive to acridine orange treatment, the strains carry an F factor extrachromosomally.

We isolated and characterized stable clones as follows: they express (1) high levels of caveolin alone, (2) hFR and caveolin, or (3) hFR alone.

40|$|Escherichia coli HIT- 1 has a {{mutation}} in the Na+/H+ antiporter gene, nhaB (P. Thelen, T. Tsuchiya, and E. B. Goldberg, J. Bacteriol. 173 : 6553 - 6557, 1991). This strain {{is not able}} to utilize serine as a carbon source (T. Ishikawa, H. Hama, M. Tsuda, and T. Tsuchiya, J. Biol. Chem. 262 : 7443 - 7446, 1987), because an active NhaB is required to maintain the electrochemical potential of Na+, which drives serine transport via the Na+/serine carrier, the major transport system for serine. We isolated recombinant cells from a cross between strains HIT- 1 and <b>Hfr,</b> and these <b>cells</b> were able to grow on serine even though the NhaB Na+/H+ antiporter of the recombinant cells was still defective. We found that the activity of the H+/serine cotransport system, one of the minor serine transport systems in E. coli, was elevated in the recombinant cells. H+/serine cotransport activity was induced by leucine in the recombinant cells more strongly than in strain HIT- 1. A kinetic analysis showed that the Vmax, but not the Km, of the transport system was much higher in the recombinant cells than in strain HIT- 1 cells...|$|R
40|$|Hirota, Yukinori (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan), Yukinobu Nishimura, Frits Ørskov, and Ida Ørskov. Effect of {{drug-resistance factor}} R on the F {{properties}} of Escherichia coli. J. Bacteriol. 87 : 341 – 351. 1964. —Infection of Escherichia coli male <b>cells</b> (<b>Hfr</b> or F+) with resistance factor R {{results in the}} co-ordinate inhibition of several distinct functions of F factor: mating capacity to transfer chromosome by conjugation, production of f+ antigen, and formation of receptors for the male-specific bacteriophages, f 1 and ribonucleic acid phage. The i− mutant (R 100 − 1) of R factor, which was isolated from wild-type R factor (R 100), shows no inhibition of these F properties. Male R+ 100 − 1 cells were autoagglutinable but the f+ antigen was still present. When R-infected female cells had acquired the ability to form recombinants with an F− strain, they also had become autoagglutinable. The question {{of the presence of}} f+ antigen in these strains was not solved. The cause of the autoagglutinability is not known, {{but it is not the}} result of loss of O antigen (rough autoagglutinability). Sensitivity to a phage tau, which can form plaques on female cells only, is not affected by the presence or absence of R factor. No difference in the pattern of segregation of recombinants was observed between the cross of Hfr R− × F− and that of Hfr R+ × F−. These results indicate that R factor controls a key mechanism in the synthesis of “F substances” formed on the cell surface by the F factor...|$|R
