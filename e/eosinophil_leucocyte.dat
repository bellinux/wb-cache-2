40|$|The {{problem in}} this {{investigation}} {{was to determine whether}} or not serial quantitative determinations of the circulating eosinophil leucocytes could be used as an index in following the clinical course of reactivated prostatic carcinoma. In patients that showed reactivation of their disease, the <b>eosinophil</b> <b>leucocyte</b> count average approximately one-third less than that of the patients that were controlled by anti-androgenic therapy. However, when individual counts in the two groups of patients were compared a great degree of overlap was noted; non-reactivated patients having <b>eosinophil</b> <b>leucocyte</b> counts, in many instances that were in the range of the counts observed in patients undergoing relapse. Low values were also observed in a group of clinically deteriorating patients with actively growing malignancies other than carcinoma of the prostate. Although acute adrenal hyperfunction results in a decrease in the number of circulating eosinophils, it is felt by most investigators at the present time that the absolute level of eosinophil leucocytes in the blood at any given time does not accurately reflect the state of adrenal cortical activity. If the suggestive depression of the eosinophil count in patients with reactivated carcinoma of the prostate is significant, it may indicate only an adrenal response to 2 ̆ 2 non-specific 2 ̆ 2 stress rather than being a specific measure of adrenal hyperactivity with resultant androgen stimulus to the tumor. From the results of this study it would seem that the <b>eosinophil</b> <b>leucocyte</b> count cannot be used in following the clinical course of reactivated prostatic carcinoma patients...|$|E

40|$|After heavy dosages {{of sensory}} {{irritants}} osmiophilic whorls (mitochondrial lamellated bodies) {{are found in}} the mitochondria of the Type II cells of the lung. To obtain evidence of their nature, the lead/osmium (Pb/Os) ratio in these and other bodies after bimetallic staining was studied by electron probe X-ray analysis during transmission electron microscopy. To allow for inter-specimen variation the Pb/Os ratio was divided by the Pb/Os ratio for chromatin in the same cell, to give a "relative ratio". The values of the latter ranged from 1. 4 for granules in an <b>eosinophil</b> <b>leucocyte</b> to 0. 60 - 0. 77 for lamellated osmiophilic bodies of Type II cells, 0. 4 for nerve myelin, and 0. 05 for fat globules. The Pb/Os ratio for mitochondrial lamellated bodies did not differ significantly from that for lamellated osmiophilic bodies (which are depots of lung surfactant) in the same cell. This is compatible with the mitochondrial lamellated bodies consisting of excess surfactant produced in response to stress. the method is capable of extension...|$|E
40|$|Background: Actinomyces {{species are}} part of mucosal {{surfaces}} of oral cavity, gastrointestinal and genital tracts. When these mucosal surfaces disrupt, Actinomyces become pathogen and cause infection. <b>Eosinophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> participate in host defense against helminthic infestation and they generally {{play a role in}} asthma and allergy. However, the role of <b>eosinophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> in host defense against bacteria is conflicting. Aim: To determine whether there is a relationship between Actinomyces-like organisms (ALOs) and <b>eosinophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> at light microscopic level. Materials and Methods: Cervicovaginal samples obtained from 200 patients were examined by both Pap smear microscopy and anaerobic culturing. Since the results obtained by these methods were not concordant for diagnosis of genital Actinomyces, 6 of 200 patients (3 %) diagnosed with ALOs by Pap smear microscopy became the study group. Patients without any infectious agents (n= 134) were the control group. Statistical analyses were conducted with χ 2 test using SPSS program. Results: The study and control groups were compared statistically in view of the presence of <b>eosinophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> and it was found that there was a significant correlation between the presence of ALOs and <b>eosinophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> (P< 0. 05). Abundant polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNLs) and macrophages were also detected in the study group.

40|$|Studies {{were done}} on the {{distribution}} and recirculation of thoracic duct lymphocytes from rats infected with Trichinella spiralis larvae. Previously it had been found that in rats with trichinosis, when large lymphocytes were transferred into normal rats, <b>eosinophil</b> <b>leucocyte</b> production was increased. These lymphocytes, which constituted up to 30 per cent of the cells in thoracic duct lymph, were specifically labelled with tritiated thymidine and they were followed in tissues and lymph. As some of the labelled large lymphocytes were found in bone marrow, it was postulated that eosinophil production could be increased by local interaction between lymphocyte, and eosinophil precursors. Large lymphocytes either divided to form small lymphocytes within 24 hours of injection, or persisted as large pyroninophilic cells in intestinal villi. Labelled lymphocytes did not accumulate around larvae in inflammatory sites where eosinophils were found, but these two cell types were commonly found together in intestinal villi. The recirculation kinetics of thoracic duct lymphocytes was not altered from normal in rats with trichinosis, and 10 – 30 per cent of the progeny of large lymphocytes recirculated into the thoracic duct lymph within 36 hours of injection...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} bronchial gland duct ectasia in fatal asthma and its association with interstitial emphysema, the histological features of 72 patients in whom death {{was considered to be}} due to asthma, and 72 matched control subjects in whom sudden death was not attributed to asthma, were reviewed. In all cases and controls, sections of two or more blocks of lung tissue stained with haematoxylin and eosin were obtained at necropsy. Bronchial gland duct ectasia was diagnosed if there was more than one abnormally dilated epithelial lined protrusion from a bronchus, extending through the smooth muscle layer. A histological diagnosis of asthma was made if four of the five following criteria were present: mucus plugging, basement membrane thickening, epithelial shedding, submucosal <b>eosinophil</b> <b>leucocyte</b> infiltration and smooth muscle hypertrophy. A histological diagnosis of asthma was made in 53 of 72 clinical cases of fatal asthma and in five of 72 control subjects. Interstitial emphysema was present in 10 clinical cases of fatal asthma, all of whom had bronchial gland duct ectasia and a histological diagnosis of asthma. Interstitial emphysema was not observed in control subjects. It is concluded that bronchial gland duct ectasia is a common histological feature of severe asthma, and that interstitial emphysema may be consequent on rupture of these dilated gland ducts...|$|E

Bundles of microfilaments measuring 5 - 7 nm in diameter were found frequently in crystal-containing granules. Staining with phosphotungstic acid (PTA) and various other cytochemical procedures gave results similar to those obtained previously in the shag and the duck. The PTA stain and peroxidase reaction product were found only in the externum of the granules whereas the acid hydrolases, acid phosphatase and arylsulphatase were located within the crystalline matrix and in or between the microfilaments.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the radioprotective efficacy of intrarectal administration of amifostine in radiation-induced proctitis compared to intraperitoneal administration. Materials and Methods: Thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: Control (CONT), irradiation alone (RT), intraperitoneal amifostine plus irradiation (IPAMI), and intrarectal amifostine plus irradiation (IRAMI). The rats in the RT, IPAMI and IRAMI groups were irradiated individually with a single dose of 17. 5 Gy to the pelvis. Amifostine was administered by the intraperitoneal (200 mg/kg) or intrarectal (2000 mg/kg) route before irradiation. Histopathologic analysis of the rectum was performed 14 days after irradiation. Results: Significant radiation damage appeared in all histopathologic parameters and was reduced by amifostine. Pretreatment with IPAMI significantly reduced the inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria (p= 0. 021), cryptitis (p= 0. 002) and crypt abscess (p= 0. 015). However, the protective effect of IRAMI was significant for all parameters with equal or higher significance than IPAMI, including the <b>eosinophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> count (p= 0. 02), and distortion of the crypts (p= 0. 008), and was also significant for regenerative/reparative atypia (p= 0. 013).

METHODS: Twenty-three VKC patients were randomised and treated bilaterally for 28 days with N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAGA) or levocabastine (LEVO) eye-drops. The primary efficacy variable, overall evolution of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) tear concentrations, was assessed in a masked fashion on D 0, D 7 and D 28. Clinical symptoms and signs were reported at the same time points. Biological parameters were analysed with a non-parametric rank-based approach. Global tolerance was assessed by the investigator and patient. RESULTS: At all time points, ECP tear levels were significantly reduced in the NAAGA compared with the LEVO group (p = 0. 023). Reduction of <b>eosinophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> and tear lymphocytes was higher not significant in the NAAGA group. The same trend was observed for the evolution of total ocular symptom score.

40|$|Although an {{association}} between high blood eosinophil counts and endomyocardial disease {{has been known for}} nearly a hundred years, the reasons for this were not understood. Brockington, Luzzatto and Osunkoya (1970) suggested that <b>eosinophil</b> <b>leucocytes,</b> in susceptible persons, by some unknown mechanisms, cause endomyocardial damage. Evidence to support this possibility has come from three sources: (1) Clinical studies have shown that very high blood eosinophil counts, from any cause, can be associated with endomyocardial disease, and in some patients it has been possible to show that eosinophilia preceded the onset of heart disease. (2) The development of heart disease has been associated with the presence of degranulated eosinophils in the blood and tissues, including damaged endomyocardium, and raised serum levels of eosinophil granule basic proteins have been found in many of these patients. (3) Low concentrations of eosinophil secretion products (which contain these eosinophil granule basic proteins) have been found to injure isolated heart cells in vitro. Studies with purified eosinophil granule basic proteins have shown that cardiac cell damage {{is the result of a}} specific toxic effect of eosinophil cationic protein on the plasma membrane and two enzyme complexes (pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2 -oxoglutarate dehydrogenase) involved in mitochondrial respiration. These results support the suggestion that under certain conditions, eosinophils may damage the heart, leading to endomyocardial disease, and they offer new approaches for the early diagnosis and treatment of endomyocardial disease both in temperate and tropical countries...|$|R
40|$|Hypersensitivity to {{formalin}} used to sterilise {{artificial kidney}} machines was shown by inhalation provocation tests {{to be responsible}} for attacks of wheezing accompanied by productive cough in two members of the nursing staff of a haemodialysis unit. Three further members of the staff of 28 who were continually exposed to this substance occupationally had developed similar recurrent but less frequent episodes since joining the unit. Two underwent inhalation provocation tests with formalin which did not reproduce these symptoms. Single episodes of these symptoms had been noted by three additional staff members so that altogether eight (29 %) had experienced attacks described as bronchitic since becoming exposed to formalin. We suggest that, while exposure to formalin {{did not seem to be}} directly responsible in all cases, it might have increased susceptibility to other provoking agents or induced a hyper-reactive responsiveness of the airways. The responses observed in the two nurses after inhalation provocation tests with fromalin were predominantly of airways obstruction. Wheezing began between two and three hours after exposure, and peak expiratory flow rates fell maximally by approximately 50 %.

Changes in {{white blood cell}} (WBC) populations and their proliferative responses to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and parasite antigens in vitro were studied in rats given one to three concurrent infections with Angiostrongylus cantonensis. WBC counts were elevated following infection; these changes were augmented following each successive reinfection. The WBC response could be partitioned into variations {{in the numbers of}} four major cell types. There was a loss of lymphocytes from the circulation after infection or reinfection followed by an increase in circulating lymphocytes when the parasite migrated to the lungs and matured. An eosinophilia was observed in all rats immediately after infection which was enhanced successively after each reinfection. The monocyte populations increased in a similar, but less obvious manner, to the <b>eosinophil</b> <b>leucocytes.</b> Neutrophil leucocytes increased after infection, but the numbers declined after reinfection. All rats given one to three infections showed a neutrophilia late in the experiment. A reversal in the neutrophil leucocyte-lymphocyte ratio was observed after each infection. A peak response in the proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro to PHA preceded and exceeded that stimulated by A. cantonensis antigen. These responses were interpreted as the dissemination of uncommitted thymus-dependent lymphocytes involved in the induction of antigen sensitized memory cells released following the protective immune reaction. The degree of lymphocyte responsiveness to mitogens correlated with the numbers of these cells circulating at each time interval. The relationships between in vitro lymphocyte responses and protective immunity in the rat against A. cantonensis are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Variations in {{the numbers}} of {{erythrocytes}} and white cells within the blood of sheep given various doses of Oesophagostomum columbianum larvae were studied over a period of 10 weeks. The sheep showed losses of red cells and haemoglobin, and the packed cell volume was diminished after infestation with O. columbianum. These effects increased in severity as the infesting dose was increased; the resistant state of the host also affected the blood picture. In all infestations the calculated absolute values for the blood, i. e. mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), did not significantly change except in the heavier infestations, where MCV increased for a time. The type of anaemia which predominated throughout these experiments was normocytic-normochromic. Where the MCV increased for a period, the anaemia was of the macrocytic-normochromic type. During the first infestation with 2000 larvae the anaemias tended to become microcytic-hyperchromic, but these changes were not significant. Gross observations on the gut indicated that one of the factors influencing the development of anaemias was the extensive tissue damage caused by the larvae, which resulted in chronic bleeding from the mucosa. This suggestion was supported by the fact that anaemias also developed during second infestations when there was no adult worm population. The white cell counts from a number of these sheep were also recorded. The most significant changes occurred after second infestation, although a general increase was noted after all first infestations as well; prominent increases occurred in the agranulocytes and the <b>eosinophil</b> <b>leucocytes.</b> The neutrophil leucocyte counts fell throughout all the infestation.

The following parameters were measured: red blood cells (RBC), haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Ht), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), platelets (PLT), plateletcrit (PCT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), white blood cells (WBC), absolute number and percentage of polymorphonuclear <b>leucocytes,</b> <b>eosinophils</b> and mononuclear <b>leucocytes,</b> IgG, IgA, IgE, IgM, CRP, a 2 macroglobulin, haptoglobin, acute-a 1 glycoprotein, prealbumin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, prothrombin, plasminogen, antithrombin III, a 1 antitrypsin, C 1 q, C 3 c, C 4, C 5, B-factor, and circulating immune complexes (CIC). Screening was made for the specific IgE against cotton. The level of cotton dust in the workplace was measured by the method of vertical elutriator. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired t-test. Results: Following cotton dust exposure of four hours duration a statistically significant increase was observed in the absolute number and the percentage of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, and in MCHC, PLT, PCT, IgG, IgA, a 2 macroglobulin, haptoglopin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, C 3 c, and C 4. There was a statistically significant decrease in the absolute number and the percentage of lymphocytes, eosinophils and monocytes, and in RBC, Hb, Ht, MCV, RDW, C 1 q and B-factor. No statistically significant changes were observed in IgE, IgM, CRP, acute-a 1 glycoprotein, prealbumin, prothrombin, plasminogen CIC, antithrombin III, and C 5. None of the workers tested positive for the specific IgE against cotton. The level of cotton dust was on average 0. 8 mg/m 3. Conclusion: After cotton dust exposure an immunological cascade takes place, probably with an acute phase reaction, activation of the classical and alternative complement pathways and possibly with a low degree of haemolysis. It is hypothesized that the main mechanism of the haematological and immunological changes observed in the population under study is a type II hypersensitivity response.

40|$|Detailed neuro-histopathological {{investigations}} were performed, being grounded on {{the general}} point of view, on thirty-one naturally occurring cases gathered during the years 1948 to 1957,of a swine disease in Janan, so-called "encephalitis eosinophilica suis. " The cardinal symptoms of it consist of circular movement, convulsions, epileptiform seizures, etc. Histopathological lesions of the disease in {{the central nervous system}} are chracterized by various processes consisting of nerve cells diffusely extending over all areas of the brain and spinal cord, mainly pseudolaminar focal necroses (pallidness or focal pallor to malacia) principally being located in the grey matter of the prosencephalon especially in the cerebral cortex and perivascular and tissue infiltration of <b>eosinophil</b> <b>leucocytes</b> principally observed in the cortex and meninges of the telencephalon. The focal necroses, furthermore, are occasionally located in the grey matter such as in the cerebral nuclei, diencephalon, mesencephalon and medulla oblongata. Histo-pathogenetically, a great importance is attached to the fact that most basic pathological processes in the central nervous system of the disease may possibly have much connection with a certain toxic condition originating from systemic metabolic disturbances of fat substances of certain kinds. Such disturbances were proved by the degenerative condition of nerve cells (acute cell change), metamorphosis of fat tissues belonging to the category of changes of "yellow fat disease, " degeneration in the parenchymatous organs and deposition of acid-fast pigment substances detected in the central nervous system, etc. It was confirmed that the necrotic-desolated processes of the central nervous system offer much evidence that they had origin in local functional disturbances of the blood circulation (SPIELMYER); such changes were regarded as secondary ones. There is no wholly denying the surmise that the acid-fast pigment substances which were regarded as an abnormal product of metabolism of fat substances of a certain kind may take part in the functional disturbances. It is conceivable, in conformity with histological findings, that these acid-fast substances may have various chemical states ranging morphologically from non-phanerous to phanerous, the latter showing acid-fastness for the most part. With the exception of reparative symptomatic inflammatory infiltration into the necrotic-desolated processes, as to eosinophil cell infiltration which was recognized in almost all the cases, {{the author would like to}} comprehend it as likely manifestation of the function of the cells which acceleratedly act to counteract to the abnormal pigment substances; in other words, such infiltration is a phenomenon which belongs to a simple reactive process of the body. With the exception of glio-mesenchymal reactive process to the necroticdesolated lesions, mesenchymal changes consisting of swelling, increase, etc. of cells of the walls of the blood vessels, being observed particularly in the grey matter and meninges of the prosencephalon, were regarded as changes reactive to the disorder of the tissue and the abnormal metabolic substances. Edematous focal tissue loosening of various degrees observed frequently in the cerebral cortex are considered to be a secondary process having to do with hyperemia and fibrin thromboses of the blood vessels principally of the veins. As to the causal genesis of the present disease, "yellow fat disease" of various creatures and encephalomalacia of chicks are referred to as interesting objects from the morphological standpoint. A certain swine disease in Europe and America, having a name similar to that of the present disease, is clinically and morphologically similar, if not identical, to the present disease...|$|R
40|$|THE {{histological}} {{appearance of}} necrogranulomatous scleritis {{is characterized by}} a central focus of scleral necrosis (sequestroid) which disintegrates, forming an area of smudgy necrosis. This sequestroid is surrounded by a wall of polymorphonuclear <b>leucocytes,</b> <b>eosinophils,</b> plasma cells, lymphocytes, epithelioid cells, and occasional giant cells. These inflammatory cells may be arranged in palisade formation. The reaction is self-perpetuat-ing, since the deep scleral reaction acts as a stimulant for further proliferative response and accounts for the chronic nature of the condition (Sevel, 1965). The characteristic histological appearance suggests that the primary focus is the scleral necrosis, around which the granulomatous reaction occurs. It is therefore of importance to establish whether the scleral necrosis is a specific change or whether it is primarily due to vascular occlusion. The sclera lies between two vascular strata-the choroid and the episclera-and probably derives its low nutritional requirements from these two sources. First the blood supply of the sclera will be described and then the effect of isolating it from the choroid and episclera will be considered...|$|R
5000|$|Worms {{can readily}} {{be seen and}} {{identified}} in the abomasum, and small petechiae (blood spots) may be visible where the worms have been feeding. The most characteristic lesions of Ostertagia infections are multiple small, white, raised umbilicated nodules 1-2 mm in diameter. These may be discrete, but in heavy infections they tend to coalesce and {{give rise to a}} [...] "cobblestone" [...] or [...] "morocco leather" [...] appearance. Nodules are most marked in the fundus region but may cover the entire abomasal mucosa. In severe cases, edema may extend over the abomasum and into the small intestine and omentum. When examined histologically, abomasal gastric glands contain larvae in varying stages of development, which results in hyperplasia and distention of the glands, and flattening of the glandular epithelium. Affected glands lack differentiated acid-producing parietal and pepsinogen producing chief cells. Type I and type II disease is often differentiated by the presence of increased numbers of globule <b>leucocytes,</b> <b>eosinophils</b> and focal aggregates of lymphoplasmocytic cells in animals with type II disease.|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{explore the}} effects and the {{mechanism}} of Wuwei Dilong Decoction (Schisandra Fruit and Earthworm Decoction) for treatment of asthma. MethodsThe asthma guinea pig model was established with spray of ovalbumin (OVA). Fifteen days later, the guinea pigs were administered by intra-gastric perfusion of Wuwei Dilong Decoction once a day for 8 consecutive days. Blood samples were taken for testing the total <b>leucocytes,</b> <b>eosinophil</b> (EOS), lymphocytes, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4). ResultsIn the asthma model group, the total leucocytes, EOS and lymphocytes were all increased, with significant differences {{as compared with the}} different dosage Wuwei Dilong Decoction groups (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05). The serum LTB 4 in the asthma model group was significantly increased and IFN-γ decreased. After administration of Wuwei Dilong Decoction of the large, medium and small dosages, LTB 4 decreased, while IFN-γ increased (P< 0. 05 or P< 0. 01). ConclusionWuwei Dilong Decoction can inhibit infiltration and diffusion of the inflammatory cells in the asthma model guinea pigs, and regulate LTB 4 and IFN-γ, which {{is probably one of the}} important mechanisms of Wuwei Dilong Decoction for relieving asthma...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{outstanding}} results of his dissertation investigations was {{the discovery of a}} new cell type. Ehrlich discovered in the protoplasm of supposed plasma cells a granulate which could be made visible {{with the help of an}} alkaline dye. He thought this granulate was a sign of good nourishment, and accordingly named these cells mast cells, (from the German word for an animal-fattening feed, Mast). This focus on chemistry was unusual for a medical dissertation. In it, Ehrlich presented the entire spectrum of known staining techniques and the chemistry of the pigments employed.While he was at the Charité, Ehrlich elaborated upon the differentiation of white blood cells according to their different granules. A precondition was a dry specimen technique, which he also developed. A drop of blood placed between two glass slides and heated over a Bunsen burner fixed the blood cells while still allowing them to be stained. Ehrlich used both alkaline and acid dyes, and also created new “neutral” dyes. For the first time this made it possible to differentiate the lymphocytes among the leucocytes (white blood cells). By studying their granulation he could distinguish between nongranular lymphocytes, mono- and poly-nuclear <b>leucocytes,</b> <b>eosinophil</b> granulocytes, and mast cells.|$|R
40|$|Leucocytes are {{essential}} in healing wounds and are predominantly {{involved in the}} inflammatory and granulation stages of wound repair. <b>Eosinophils</b> are granulocytic <b>leucocytes</b> and are specifically regulated by interleukin- 5 (IL- 5), a cytokine produced by T helper 2 (Th 2) cells. To characterize more clearly {{the role of the}} IL- 5 and eosinophils in the wound healing process, IL- 5 -overexpressing and IL- 5 -deficient mice were used as models of eosinophilia and eosinophil depletion, respectively. Our results reveal a significantly altered inflammatory response between IL- 5 -overexpressing and IL- 5 knockout mice post-wounding. Healing was significantly delayed in IL- 5 -overexpressing mice with wounds gaping wider and exhibiting impaired re-epithelialization. A delay in collagen deposition was observed suggesting a direct effect on matrix synthesis. A significant increase in inflammatory cell infiltration, particularly eosinophils and CD 4 + cells, one of the main cell types which secrete IL- 5, was observed in IL- 5 -overexpressing mice wounds suggesting that one of the main roles of IL- 5 in wound repair may be to promote the infiltration of eosinophils into healing wounds. Healing is delayed in IL- 5 -overexpressing mice and this corresponds to significantly increased levels of eosinophils and CD 4 + cells within the wound site that may contribute to and exacerbate the inflammatory response, resulting in detrimental wound repair.

40|$|Technetium- 99 m-Exametazime (HMPAO) {{is widely}} used for {{radiolabelling}} leucocytes for localization of infection. The subcellular distribution of radionuclide in the labelled cells {{and the distribution of}} radioactivity among the leucocyte population are incompletely understood. Frozen section autoradiography was used to determine quantitatively the distribution of Tc- 99 m in leucocytes labelled with Tc- 99 m-Exametazime. Sections of rapidly frozen suspensions of labelled leucocytes in plasma were autoradiographed on Ilford K 2 emulsion and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Neutrophils, eosinophils and mononuclear cells were separated by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Cell nuclei were isolated by a rapid cell-breakage and fractionation method. In a typical experiment mean grain densities [grains/ 100 mu m(2) (ESD) ] over cells were: eosinophils 31. 2 (18. 4), neutrophils 3. 5 (3. 5), mononuclear cells 4. 2 (5. 1). Mean grain numbers per cell (ESD) were: eosinophils 13 (6. 8), neutrophils 1. 3 (1. 3), mononuclear cells 1. 1 (1. 3). These findings were confirmed by separation of labelled leucocytes on discontinuous density gradients. In four separation experiments, the mean activity-per-cell ratio for eosinophils to neutrophils was 10. 1 (4. 8) : 1, and for eosinophils to mononuclear cells, 14. 1 (6. 7) : 1. The subcellular distribution of the label was investigated using image analysis of autoradiographs and cell fractionation. This revealed no selectivity for nuclear or extranuclear compartments. It may be concluded that Tc- 99 m-Exametazime has strong selectivity for <b>eosinophils</b> over other <b>leucocytes</b> but no selectivity for nuclear/cytoplasmic compartments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the immune response in young Ile de France (IF) and Santa Ines (SI) sheep naturally infected by Oestrus ovis and gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN). Mast cells, <b>eosinophils</b> and globule <b>leucocytes</b> were enumerated in the upper respiratory tract (septum, middle meatus and ventral nasal conchae) and in the mucosa of abomasum and small intestine. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in serum samples and immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels in mucus from the nasal, abomasum and small intestinal mucosae were determined against O. ovis, Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis antigens. Significant positive correlation coefficients were observed in both breeds {{between the number of}} O. ovis larvae×IgG against Oestrus crude extract (IF: r= 0. 58; SI: r= 0. 66; P< 0. 05), and between O. ovis larvae x IgG against Oestrus excretory and secretory products (IF: r= 0. 59; SI: r= 0. 63; P< 0. 05). Apparently, the presence of antibodies in the serum or nasal mucus, as well as inflammatory cells, was not able to efficiently protect against O. ovis infestation. With regard to GIN, the levels of immunoglobulins and the inflammatory cell numbers in the gastrointestinal mucosa presented a significant inverse relationship with H. contortus worm burden in SI animals and this {{may have contributed to the}} fact that these animals presented the lowest FEC and worm burden compared to IF. In conclusion, the immune responses against O. ovis and GIN are very similar and involve the recruitment of inflammatory cells and production of immunoglobulins against the parasites...|$|R
