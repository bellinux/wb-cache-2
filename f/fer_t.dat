40|$|Although s t i l l {{regarded}} {{with considerable}} suspicion, the academic study of black South African theatre has recently become a respectable activity in some South African universities. This recognition, however, is tempered by {{a fear that}} classical 'civi l izing ' influences on humankind wil l be invaded and vitiated by an inevitable mixing of 'art 1 with 'pol i t ies '. The more traditional approach which over-emphasises textual analysis comfortably con-fines the irreducible and protects i t from socio-historical and politico-economic investigation. Such influences are often argued to {{have nothing to do}} with theatre and are deliberately exorcised from the play. The result, we are told, is a richer, more acceptable contribution to 'culture! Any theatre which does not reproduce (albeit crit ically) the dominant social relations of society is considered vulgar and an insult to theatrical tradition which has become progressively divorced from the once <b>fer</b> <b>t</b> i le breeding ground of social experience i tself (1).

40|$|Three {{recently}} isolated extremely acidophilic archaeal strains {{have been}} shown to be phylogenetically similar to Ferroplasma acidiphilum Y-T by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. All four Ferroplasma isolates were capable of growing chemoorganotrophically on yeast extract or a range of sugars and chemomixotrophically on ferrous iron and yeast extract or sugars, and isolate "Ferroplasma acidarmanus" <b>Fer</b> 1 (<b>T)</b> required much higher levels of organic carbon. All four isolates were facultative anaerobes, coupling chemoorganotrophic growth on yeast extract to the reduction of ferric iron. The temperature optima for the four isolates were between 35 and 42 degreesC and the pH optima were 1. 0 to 1. 7, and "F. acidarmanus" <b>Fer</b> 1 (<b>T)</b> was capable of growing at pH 0. The optimum yeast extract concentration for "F. acidarmanus" <b>Fer</b> 1 (<b>T)</b> was higher than that for the other three isolates. Phenotypic results suggested that isolate "F. acidarmanus" <b>Fer</b> 1 (<b>T)</b> is of a different species than the other three strains, and 16 S rRNA sequence data, DNA-DNA similarity values, and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein profiles clearly showed that strains DR 1, MT 17, and Y-T group as a single species. "F. acidarmanus" <b>Fer</b> 1 (<b>T)</b> groups separately, and we propose the new species "F. acidarmanus" <b>Fer</b> 1 (<b>T)</b> sp. nov...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposed}} a new facial expression recognition algorithm based on gabor texture features and Adaboost feature selection via SRC(sparse representation classification). Five scales and eight orientations of Gabor wavelet filters {{were used in}} this paper to extract gabor features. For an image of size 6464 ×, the number of gabor features is 163840, In order to extract the most effective features for FER(facial expression recognition), Adaboost algorithm is used for feature selection. This paper divided 7 facial expressions into two categories, where the neutral expression as the first class and the remaining six expressions as the second class. In each size and orientation 110 features are selected. At last 4400 features are selected combined SRC algorithm for <b>FER.</b> <b>Test</b> experiments were performed on Japanese female JAFFE facial expression database. Compared with the traditional expression recognition algorithms such as 2 DPCA+SVM, LDA+SVM, the new algorithm achieved a better recognition rate, which shows {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed new algorithm...|$|R

An' Ted Meeker heerd it from Greaves, who didn't die till {{the next day}} after Jean Isbel knifed him. An' your dad shot <b>Ted</b> <b>fer</b> tellin' what he heerd.... No, Greaves wasn't killed outright. He was cut somethin' turrible--in two places. They wrapped him all up an' next day packed him in a wagon back to Grass Valley. Evarts says Ted Meeker was {{friendly}} with Greaves an' {{went to see him}} as he was layin' in his room next to the store. Wal, accordin' to Meeker's story, Greaves came to an' talked. He said he was sittin' there in the dark, shootin' occasionally at Isbel's cabin, when he heerd a rustle behind him in the grass. He knowed some one was crawlin' on him. But before he could get his gun around he was jumped by {{what he thought was a}} grizzly bear. But it was a man. He shut off Greaves's wind an' dragged him back in the ditch. An' he said: 'Greaves, it's the half-breed. An' he's goin' to cut you--FIRST FOR ELLEN JORTH! an' then for Gaston Isbel!' ... Greaves said Jean ripped him with a bowie knife.... An' thet was all Greaves remembered. He died soon after tellin' this story. He must hev fought awful hard. Thet second cut Isbel gave him went clear through him.... Some of the gang was thar when Greaves talked, an' naturally they wondered why Jean Isbel had said 'first for Ellen Jorth.' ... Somebody remembered thet Greaves had cast a slur on your good name, Ellen. An' then they had Jean Isbel's reason fer sayin' thet to Greaves. It caused a lot of talk. An' when Simm Bruce busted in some of the gang haw-hawed him an' said as how he'd get the third cut from Jean Isbel's bowie. Bruce was half drunk an' he began to cuss an' rave about Jean Isbel bein' in love with his girl.... As bad luck would have it, a couple of more fellars come in an' asked Meeker questions. He jest got to thet part, 'Greaves, it's the half-breed, an' he's goin' to cut you--FIRST FOR ELLEN JORTH,' when in walked your father! ... Then it all had to come out--what Jean Isbel had said an' done--an' why. How Greaves had backed Simm Bruce in slurrin' you!" ...|$|R
