5|$|The Pranotasani Tantra narrates {{that once}} Parvati longed to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{maternal}} house for some days and asked Shiva's {{permission to do}} so. The reluctant Shiva agreed {{on the condition that}} if she did not return in a few days, he would come to fetch her. Parvati agreed and went to her father Himalaya's place, where she stayed for many days. The lovesick Shiva went to Himalaya's abode disguised as an ornament seller and sold shell ornaments to Parvati. In order to test her fidelity, the disguised Shiva asked for sex in return. The disgusted Parvati was about to curse the ornament-seller, when she realizes by her yogic powers that it was none other than Shiva. She agrees to grant sexual favours but at the appropriate time. In the evening, Parvati returns to Shiva's abode disguised as a Chandala huntress. She is dressed in red and had a lean figure and large breasts and performs a seductive dance to lure him. She told Shiva that she had come to do penance. Shiva replied that he is the one gives fruit to all penance and took her hand and kissed her. Further, they made love when Shiva himself changed into a Chandala and recognized the Chandala woman as his wife. After the love-making, Parvati asked Shiva to grant her wish that her form as a Chandalini (the Chandala female form in which Shiva made love to her) might last forever as Ucchishta-Chandalini and that her worship in this form precede his for his worship to be considered fruitful. This tale is also found in many Bengali Mangalkavyas. In these texts, however, Parvati is not explicitly identified with Matangi.|$|E

In an interview for Billboard, Sia said, [...] "She [...] was just excited {{to get to work}} with the artists she loves. There's this misconception that she's a middle-America kind of person.

500|$|Disillusioned by her firing from Dr. Vegas, Adams, at 30 years old, {{considered}} {{looking for}} an alternate career after finishing work on the sole project she was signed to. It was the independent comedy-drama Junebug, which had a production budget of under $1 million. Directed by Phil Morrison, the film featured Adams as Ashley Johnsten, a perky and talkative pregnant woman. Morrison was impressed by Adams' ability to not question her character's inherently good motives. She found a connection with Johnsten's faith in God, and spent time with Morrison in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (where the film is set), attending Sunday church. She described making the film as [...] "the summer I grew into myself", and after dyeing her hair red for the part, she decided to not <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> natural blonde color. Junebug premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, where Adams won a special jury prize. Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph labeled the film a [...] "small, quiet miracle" [...] and wrote that Adams had given [...] "one of the most delicately funny and heartbreaking performances it's ever been my pleasure to review". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post opined that her [...] "radiant portrayal" [...] reflected the film's [...] "deeply humanist heart". Adams received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination and won an Independent Spirit Award.|$|E
500|$|Their mutual {{passion for}} science brought them {{increasingly}} closer, {{and they began}} to develop feelings for one another. Eventually Pierre proposed marriage, but at first Marie did not accept as she was still planning to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> native country. Pierre, however, declared that he was ready to move with her to Poland, even if it meant being reduced to teaching French. Meanwhile, for the 1894 summer break, Marie returned to Warsaw, where she visited her family. She was still laboring under the illusion that {{she would be able to}} work in her chosen field in Poland, but she was denied a place at Kraków University because she was a woman. A letter from Pierre convinced her to return to Paris to pursue a Ph.D. At Marie's insistence, Pierre had written up his research on magnetism and received his own doctorate in March 1895; he was also promoted to professor at the School. A contemporary quip would call Marie, [...] "Pierre's biggest discovery." [...] On 26 July 1895 they were married in Sceaux (Seine); neither wanted a religious service. Marie's dark blue outfit, worn instead of a bridal gown, would serve her for many years as a laboratory outfit. They shared two pastimes: [...] long bicycle trips, and journeys abroad, which brought them even closer. In Pierre, Marie had found a new love, a partner, and a scientific collaborator on whom she could depend.|$|E
