6000|$|... --Damn this blankety blank holder, he said, {{taking it}} from his mouth and smiling and {{frowning}} upon it tolerantly. It's always getting stuck like that. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>use</b> a holder? ...|$|E

6000|$|His mind {{seemed to}} have divided itself into several compartments, {{each with its own}} {{particular}} discussion busily in progress, and quite regardless of the others.
