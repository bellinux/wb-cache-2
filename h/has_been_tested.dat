While niobium dust is an eye and skin irritant {{and a potential}} fire hazard, elemental niobium {{on a larger scale}} is physiologically inert (and thus hypoallergenic) and harmless. It is frequently used in jewelry and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> for use in some medical implants.|$|E
5|$|The ease of {{maintaining}} these birds in captivity {{has made them}} popular for studying behavior and physiology. Feeding behavior can be predicted by the optimal foraging theory, where animals minimize time and energy spent to maximize food intake. This theory <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> by studying the strategies used by scaly-breasted munias to increase their feeding efficacy.|$|E
5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{initially}} taken as postulates, but {{today there are}} efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the fine structure constant {{over much of the}} age of the universe is of order 10−5. Also, general relativity has passed stringent tests on the scale of the Solar System and binary stars.|$|E

40|$|The purpose {{with this}} thesis was to {{estimate}} the parameters {{from one of the}} electrical equivalent circuits that are used for batteries. Two different batteries with different chemistries <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>tested.</b> First measurements at different frequencies <b>have</b> <b>been</b> performed to obtain the impedance at a specific frequency. When the impedance is known, the information {{can be used in a}} Nyquist diagram, where two parameters can be estimated, then the rest of the parameters are calculated from transfer functions. Two methods <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> to achieve the parameter values. This thesis has tested two batteries at different State of charge and temperatures. The State of charge <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> from either 0 - 100 % or 100 - 0 % State of charge and the temperatures <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> between 0 ° C and 40 ° C...|$|R
5|$|Chemical {{compounds}} {{can bind to}} troponin C to act as troponin activators (calcium sensitizers) or troponin inhibitors (calcium desensitizers). There {{are already}} multiple troponin activators that bind to fast skeletal troponin C, of which tirasemtiv <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> in multiple clinical trials. In contrast, there are no known compounds that bind with high affinity to cardiac troponin C. The calcium sensitizer, levosimendan, is purported to bind to troponin C, but only weak or inconsistent binding has been detected, precluding any structure determination. In contrast, levosimendan inhibits type 3 phosphodiesterase with nanomolar affinity, so its biological target is controversial.|$|E
5|$|Further {{tests of}} general {{relativity}} include precision measurements of the Shapiro effect or gravitational time delay for light, most recently in 2002 by the Cassini space probe. One set of tests focuses on effects predicted by general relativity for the behavior of gyroscopes travelling through space. One of these effects, geodetic precession, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> with the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment (high-precision measurements of the orbit of the Moon). Another, which is related to rotating masses, is called frame-dragging. The geodetic and frame-dragging effects were both tested by the Gravity Probe B satellite experiment launched in 2004, with results confirming relativity to within 0.5% and 15%, respectively, as of December 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{suggested}} subspecies {{were never}} widely used or validated by field biologists; the described morphological differences were small {{enough that they}} could have resulted from simple variation in nonrepresentative samples. Genetic analyses have tested the existence of three of these putative subspecies. A study examining mitochondrial DNA from skin biopsies taken from 13 sampling locations, considered genetic diversity and structure among hippo populations across the continent. The authors found low, but significant, genetic differentiation among H. a. amphibius, H. a. capensis, and H. a. kiboko. Neither H. a. tschadensis nor H. a. constrictus <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>tested.</b>|$|E

40|$|To see how {{successful}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) counseling and <b>testing</b> efforts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in <b>testing</b> the United States population, particularly among those {{at increased risk for}} HIV infection, we analyzed data from the 1989 National Health Interview Survey. Twenty percent of the NHIS sample (or, in terms of the general US population, an estimated 36 million persons) reported <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> for HIV antibodies, mostly through blood donations. Although persons with increased risk of HIV infection <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> and counseled at a much higher rate than the general population, the majority of this group <b>had</b> not yet <b>been</b> <b>tested...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{difference}} in gene frequencies between the original population and colony may also trigger {{the two groups}} to diverge significantly {{over the course of}} many generations. As the difference, or genetic distance, increases, the two separated populations may become distinct, both genetically and phenetically, although not only genetic drift but also natural selection, gene flow, and mutation contribute to this divergence. This potential for relatively rapid changes in the colony's gene frequency led most scientists to consider the founder effect (and by extension, genetic drift) a significant driving force in the evolution of new species. Sewall Wright was the first to attach this significance to random drift and small, newly isolated populations with his shifting balance theory of speciation. Following after Wright, Ernst Mayr created many persuasive models to show that the decline in genetic variation and small population size following the founder effect were critically important for new species to develop. However, there is much less support for this view today since the hypothesis <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> repeatedly through experimental research and the results have been equivocal at best.|$|E
