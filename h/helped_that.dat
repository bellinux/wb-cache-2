5|$|It is {{uncertain}} when Akhmad Bassah was born, {{though he is}} thought to have been raised in Bandung, western Java, where he graduated from a Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs. Bassah spent time working on the state-operated railroad, apparently rising to a fairly high position, but was fired for organizing a strike of the Union of Train and Tramway Personnel. Although he left the company, Bassah remained active in social movements. He was {{an active member of the}} Sarekat Rakyat (People's Union), an organization with communist leanings, and <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> group in its mission of social service.|$|E
5|$|Before the mid-1870s, the {{judicial}} system of the Orange Free State was rather amateurish and haphazard in character, particularly {{because most of the}} judges were legally unqualified. Most of {{the judicial}} procedures were in the hands of district magistrates, the so-called Landdrosts, whose main task was administrative. Reitz's first task was to ameliorate this situation, which he did with much vigour. Well within his first year of tenure the Volksraad passed an Ordinance, in which both a professional Circuit Court and a Supreme Court were called into being. Reitz became the first president of the Supreme Court and consequently also the first Chief Justice of the Orange Free State. Right from the beginning Reitz showed himself to be a fighter, opposing the Volksraad on more than one occasion, tackling deeply ingrained political traditions that stood {{in the way of the}} modernisation of {{the judicial system}}, but also fighting hard to get the salaries and pensions of state officials improved. As a colonial – he was born in the Cape Colony after all – he had to win the confidence of the Boer population to have his ideas accepted. This he did by travelling with the Circuit Court through the country for over ten years, acquiring insight into and empathy for their way of life and their often conservative and always God-fearing beliefs. It <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> Reitz himself was a religious person and that he had started out in life in the Afrikaans speaking countryside of the Cape Colony. Eventually he became the symbol of Afrikanerdom for many Orange Free Staters.|$|E
5|$|Born on 9 January 1910 in Damascus to {{a middle}} class Greek Orthodox Christian family, his father, Joseph, working as a grain merchant. Aflaq was first educated in the westernized schools of the French Mandate of Syria. In 1929, he left Syria to study {{philosophy}} abroad at the Sorbonne in Paris. During his stay Aflaq {{was influenced by the}} works of Henri Bergson, and met his longtime collaborator Salah al-Din al-Bitar, a fellow Syrian nationalist. Aflaq founded an Arab Student Union at the Sorbonne, and discovered the writings of Karl Marx. He returned to Syria in 1932, and became active in communist politics, but left the movement when the government of Léon Blum, supported by the French Communist Party (FCP), continued France's old politics towards its colonies. Aflaq, and others, had believed that the FCP followed pro-independence policies towards the French colonies. It had not <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> the Syrian–Lebanese Communist Party (SLCP) supported the FCP's decision. From then on Aflaq saw the communist movement as a tool of the Soviet Union. He was impressed by the organisation and ideology of Antun Saadeh's Syrian Social Nationalist Party.|$|E

25|$|It {{could not}} but have <b>helped</b> <b>that,</b> in the meantime, Germany had started Operation Barbarossa, an {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union (22 June 1941), as her intelligence obtained from the Musketeers had predicted.

25|$|Shastri had a {{slow start}} to the tournament but {{finished}} with fifties {{in the last three}} matches. Srikkanth too scored three fifties and India posted century opening stands against Australia and in the final. India went in with two spinners for every match. It <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> all the matches were played at Melbourne and Sydney which have turning tracks and long boundaries. Sivaramakrishnan and Shastri claimed 18 wickets between them in five matches.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} his posting to Islamabad that Sharaf met {{and became a}} close friend of then Colonel and later Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, it <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> both men were born in the same upper Egyptian town of Aswan. At the time, Tantawi was serving as Egypt's Military Attaché in Islamabad. Sharaf would serve in Islamabad till 1977. His younger brother Ezz El-din would also serve in Islamabad, in the early eighties, as Egypt's {{ambassador}} to Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|Security at Los Alamos {{was very}} tight by {{standards}} of the time. The site was an uninhabited desert location (formerly a private school) whose perimeter was fenced, with guards at the gates. The scientists were permitted outside the facility {{but there was little}} available transportation. (Since they were not members of the military, they could not be ordered to comply with military secrecy orders and instead voluntarily agreed to abide by them.) Although urban-raised scientists, like Ashkin, were far from the amusements that cities afford, they were able to find amusing things to do. It <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> some of the married ones were able to bring their wives to live in the town of Los Alamos and thus parties of men and women could get together for social activities. These include such things as hikes of hills and canyons of the surrounding wilderness areas. It's likely Ashkin played outdoor team sports while at Los Alamos. A Met Lab colleague remembered playing touch football with him and Feld on an open space called the midway at the University of Chicago.|$|E
500|$|After {{three years}} in St. Louis, Dunlap was sold to the Detroit Wolverines and <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> team win the 1887 National League pennant. Dunlap's {{baseball}} career ended in 1891 when he broke his leg sliding into a base. He went into the construction business and bet on the horses in the 1890s. By 1902, Dunlap was penniless {{and living in a}} rundown boarding house. He died of [...] "consumption of the bowels" [...] in December 1902, and his body was unidentified until a policeman at the morgue recognized his body as that of the former baseball star.|$|E
500|$|Coghill {{was cast}} as Tony on 20 June 2008. He deemed {{the role the}} most {{challenging}} he had ever played, but hoped that it would help to raise public awareness of child abuse. Of his off-screen relationship with McGarty, Coghill explained that it <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> she does not look or act like a young child, deeming her [...] "fantastic to work with", as well as [...] "very natural, very instinctive and a natural actress", commenting: [...] "There isn't any uncomfortable feeling at all." [...] Having undergone a thorough characterisation session, Coghill began shooting on 30 June 2008, and first appeared on-screen on 12 September 2008.|$|E

500|$|Reaction to the [...] "feud" [...] by {{both the}} public and the media was mostly positive. TV Squad's Annie Wu wrote: [...] "With the three hosts {{appearing}} on each other's shows all on one night, it was special appearances galore. It became a clash of the Titans, a battle of epic proportions, a heaping helping of Monday fanservice." [...] Even so, the three comedians [...] "shared a certain comedic sensibility", and admitted that they had a good time while helping each other out. O'Brien said: [...] "It certainly <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> all three of us [...] in a period of our careers where we're looking for content." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{suffered}} a miscarriage around 2010 or 2011, describing it as [...] "the saddest thing" [...] {{she had ever}} endured. She returned to the studio and wrote music in order {{to cope with the}} loss. In April 2011, Beyoncé and Jay-Z traveled to Paris in order to shoot the album cover for 4, and unexpectedly became pregnant in Paris. In August, the couple attended the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, at which Beyoncé performed [...] "Love on Top" [...] and ended the performance by revealing she was pregnant. Her appearance <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> year's MTV Video Music Awards become the most-watched broadcast in MTV history, pulling in 12.4million viewers; the announcement was listed in Guinness World Records for [...] "most tweets per second recorded for a single event" [...] on Twitter, receiving 8,868 tweets per second and [...] "Beyonce pregnant" [...] was the most Googled term the week of August 29, 2011. On January 7, 2012, Beyoncé gave birth to a daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.|$|E

2500|$|It <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> Schelsky was {{an outspoken}} liberal professor, without any {{ambition}} to create adherents - a rare bird among German mandarins. He helped another 17 sociologists qualify as lecturers (outnumbering in this any other {{professor in the}} Humanities and Social Sciences) and anticipated the boom in sociological chairs at German universities. [...] Manning them, he was professionally even more successful than the outstanding remigrants René König (Cologne) and Otto Stammer (Berlin) - the Frankfurt School starting to be of influence only after 1968.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difficult}} XTC sessions {{produced the}} album Skylarking (1986), now considered {{a high point}} for band and producer despite its acrimonious origin. Rundgren's production of Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell (1977) (on which he also played lead guitar) <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> album {{become one of the}} top selling LPs released in the 1970s. The industry regard for Rundgren's production work has been a lofty one: Jim Steinman, with whom Rundgren worked on Bat Out of Hell, has said in interviews, that [...] "Todd Rundgren is a genius and I don't use that word a lot." ...|$|E

2500|$|Now it {{was time}} for Huxley to tackle the subject of {{evolution}} at full length, in what became the defining work of his life. His role was that of a synthesiser, and it <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> he had met many of the other participants. His book [...] was written whilst he was secretary to the Zoological Society, and made use of his remarkable collection of reprints covering {{the first part of the}} century. It was published in 1942. Reviews of the book in learned journals were little short of ecstatic; the American Naturalist called it [...] "The outstanding evolutionary treatise of the decade, perhaps of the century. The approach is thoroughly scientific; the command of basic information amazing".|$|E
2500|$|Burton {{said that}} portraying {{a younger age}} (16 at 21) was not a problem, except for one aspect: [...] "My only concern was when I had to put on my cheerleading uniform again. You forget how nerve-racking that is [...] the {{vulnerability}} of wearing bloomers." [...] She said she reread some of her journals {{from high school to}} get [...] "into that place" [...] as a high school student again, and that Peyton being similar to how she was in high school helped. [...] "It also <b>helped</b> <b>that</b> the town where we film, Wilmington, isn’t too different from the hometown where I grew up in Virginia. Both [...] small towns where high school sports played a big part," [...] she stated.|$|E

[...] The trouble with him was that he had no brain as he himself was concerned. [...] He knew enough to make money for others, but never could make anything for himself. I don’t think that his playing days are over yet, but every club in the league seems inclined to turn him down. [...] Mike has a great many friends in every town where baseball is played and it will be bad policy on the magnates’ [...] part to retire him from the game which he has adorned so long." ...|$|E
