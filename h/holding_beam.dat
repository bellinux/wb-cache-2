Our experiments show that the <b>holding</b> <b>beam</b> injection into the SOA increases its 3 -dB saturation output power and decreases its dynamic gain recovery time over a broadband of optical signal wavelength, without sacrificing its non-saturated gain neither changing its noise figure (NF). In addition, we demonstrate that the <b>holding</b> <b>beam</b> injection is a helpful technique for reducing the inter-channel crosstalk induced between signals due to the cross-gain modulation (XGM) effects in the SOA. By bit error rate (BER) measurements, we show that the crosstalk penalties imposed between two optical signals, modulated at 2. 5 Gb/s and traveling through the SOA, can be considerably reduced by a <b>holding</b> <b>beam</b> power (of 19 dBm) injection at the gain transparency wavelength (1480 nm) inside the SOA cavity in counter-propagating direction...|$|E

Given that storage rings at CERN routinely <b>hold</b> <b>beam</b> for many hours, it might be thought noise will be of no consequence to the KAON Factory[1] given that the storage time is at most 100 ms.

40|$|We {{formulate}} a model including the thermal dynamics {{in the time}} evolution of a passive semiconductor microresonator, containing a bulk medium, driven by a coherent <b>holding</b> <b>beam.</b> Thermal effects {{are taken into account}} via a dynamical equation for the lattice temperature, describing heat dissipation toward the environment, heating due to carrier generation, and thermal diffusion. The temperature dynamics is coupled to the carrier and field dynamics via the material susceptibility, a red-shift of the band-gap energy of the semiconductor upon an increase of temperature and a linear shift of the cavity resonance. The presence of thermal effects introduces a Hopf instability which, in certain regions of the parameter space, dominates the dynamics of the system. In this case our numerical simulations show that the output intensity may oscillate for constant <b>holding</b> <b>beam</b> intensity (regenerative oscillations), and if the input intensity grows slowly enough the hysteresis cycle may be inverted (switching point inversion). Oscillatory instabilities can also develop a modulational character, meaning that travelling patterns can be found. These phenomena develop over the slow timescale (microseconds) characterizing thermal effects in these devices. In other parameter regimes, the well-known Turing instability giving rise to stationary modulated patterns prevails, and the system displays the usual scenario of stable patterns and cavity solitons. Thermal effects seem not to play any relevant role in these regimes...|$|E

The challenge with using IMPT when treating HCC however, is that the tumor moves over time due to breathing and the sensitive spatio-temporal resolution of the IMPT is therefore compromised in the treatment delivery, giving rise to the so-called interplay effect. This effect can be mitigated by, for example, breath <b>hold,</b> <b>beam</b> gating, tumor tracking or rescanning. The impact of interplay effect has been simulated for treatment delivery in breath hold as well as for free-breathing and the benefit of using rescanning has been investigated.
