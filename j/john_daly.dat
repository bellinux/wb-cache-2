As a young teenager, Woods first met Jack Nicklaus in Los Angeles at the Bel-Air Country Club, when Nicklaus was performing a clinic for the club's members.

500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Canada he {{continued}} {{to serve in the}} Algonquin Regiment militia as a non-permanent active member. [...] Following in his father's and grandfather's footsteps, he was elected chief of the Parry Island Band from February 1921. [...] Once in office he caused a schism in the band after he wrote a letter calling for certain individuals and those of mixed race to be expelled from the reserve. [...] He was re-elected in 1924 and served until he was deposed via an internal power struggle in April 1925. [...] Before the motion could go through, Pegahmagabow resigned. [...] A decade later, he was appointed councillor from 1933 to 1936. [...] In 1933 the Department of Indian Affairs (DIA) changed its policies and forbade First Nation chiefs from corresponding with the DIA. [...] They directed that all correspondence, as of the spring of 1933, go through the Indian Agent. [...] This gave huge power to the Agent, something that grated on Pegahmagabow, who did not get along with his Indian Agent, <b>John</b> <b>Daly.</b> [...] First Nation members who served in the army during World War I were particularly active as political activists. [...] They had travelled the world, earned the respect of the comrades in the trenches, and refused to be sidelined by the newly empowered Indian Agent. [...] Historian Paul Williams termed these advocates [...] "returned soldier chiefs", and singled out a few, including Pegahmagabow, as being especially active. [...] This caused intense disagreements with Daly and eventually led to Pegahmagabow being deposed as chief. [...] Daly and other agents who came in contact with Pegahmagabow were incredibly frustrated by his attempts, in his words, to free his people from [...] "white slavery". [...] The Indian agents labelled him a [...] "mental case" [...] and strove to sideline him and his supporters.|$|E
