5|$|After World War II, {{residential}} development continued {{to expand in}} the watershed of Darby Creek. The automobile replaced railroads as the dominant form of transportation, and it allowed workers to live farther from their places of employment. As a result, the population of Springfield Township more than doubled between 1950 and 1960. The Tinicum Wildlife Preserve was established in 1955 after the Gulf Oil Corporation donated a diked impoundment on the creek to the City of Philadelphia. Local resident Jean Diehl started a grassroots campaign to preserve the marsh in 1969, and Two Studies of Tinicum Marsh was published the following year which demonstrated the ecological importance of the marsh. The Folcroft Landfill and the Clearview Landfill operated along the creek between the 1950s and the 1970s before closing in the mid 1970s. The former is {{on the west bank}} of the creek and the latter is on the east bank. They supposedly accepted municipal waste, <b>demolition</b> <b>waste,</b> and medical waste. A number of businesses operated at the site of the Clearview Landfill after its closing.|$|E

40|$|Building {{demolition}} imposes substantial environmental impacts. In particular, {{large amount}} of <b>demolition</b> <b>wastes</b> are disposed to landfills. A solution to ease the situation is to maximally reuse and recycle waste building material. Management philosophies such as Just-in-time are applied into demolition project management {{in order to promote}} reuse and recycling of <b>demolition</b> <b>wastes.</b> Transportation logistics, widely applied in the manufacturing industry, is ideal to be adopted into demolition projects to optimise waste material production, inventorying, and transportation. In particular, it enables right types and amounts of dismantled building materials to be transferred to right location, and at right time, as required by material demanders. Consequently, waste reuse and recycling can be facilitated. Furthermore, logistics management helps the demolition project team to reduce cost, shorten project duration, and satisfy material demanders. Transportation planning concerns thorough preparation technically and managerially on the demolition site for transportation activities. Information exchange is playing a significant role in delivering and sharing information among project participants, including building owner, demolition project team, potential material demanders, and transporters. This research paper aims to identify the role of transportation logistics in a building demolition project and to analyse inventory control, transportation, and various technical aspects of logistic management for <b>demolition</b> <b>wastes.</b> <br /...|$|R

The disposal of this waste {{is a very serious}} problem because it requires huge space and very little demolished waste is recycled or reused. In this experimental study, the utilization of building demolished waste in the manufacturing of Porous concrete as a replacement of coarse aggregate. The mechanical properties of the concrete have been investigated for nominal mix and mix design as per the mix design codes IS 10262 - 2009 and IS 12727 : 1989. Porous concrete is no fines concrete with desired degree of compressive strength with high porosity to allow permeability.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} tendency to recycle the wastes generated by building companies in the construction industry, <b>demolition</b> <b>wastes</b> being the most important in terms of volume. The aim of this work is to study the possibility of using recycled aggregates from construction and <b>demolition</b> <b>wastes</b> in the preparation of precast non-structural concretes. To that purpose, two different percentages (15 % and 30 %) of natural aggregates were substituted by recycled aggregates in the manufacture of paving blocks and hollow tiles. Dosages used by the company have not been changed by the introduction of recycled aggregate. Precast elements have been tested by means of compressive and flexural strength, water absorption, density, abrasion, and slipping resistance. The results obtained show the possibility of using these wastes at an industrial scale, satisfying the requirements of the Spanish standards for these elements.

40|$|In France the {{building}} industry {{accounts for the}} largest share of greenhouse gas emissions. It represents about one quarter of France’s national emissions. To deal with this challenge, the French energy transition for Green Growth law was adopted in July 2015. Buildings renovation, clean transport, renewable energy and the circular economy are at the agenda. The law sets several ambitious objectives for construction and <b>demolition</b> <b>wastes</b> (C&DW). The goal is to recycle 70 % of construction and engineering waste by 2020 while around 60 % of construction and <b>demolition</b> <b>wastes</b> (C&DW) are currently reused, recycled or recovered. Reuse of components is currently undisclosed but represents an opportunity to fully take advantage of wastes potential. Moreover, it brings environmental and economic benefits for future constructions and local territories. This paper focuses on the economic benefits of reuse. The aim is to examine whether a demolition project promoting the reuse of <b>demolition</b> <b>wastes</b> offers value for money in comparison with a demolition project that does business as usual. After a literature survey, an in depth evaluation of costs and labour impacts is proposed for a case concerning bricks for a small arena. Results show that reuse can bring direct economic benefits if the demolition process {{is based on the}} same tools as a traditional demolition. Moreover it would have a positive impact both in terms of direct costs and local employment if the process is optimised. Deconstruction {{is still in its infancy}} and the value-added chain is not well developed. Thus, the learning curve is important.
