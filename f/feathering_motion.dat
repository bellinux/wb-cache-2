The analytical study presented includes elastic coupling between inplane and out-of-plane deflections {{as a function of}} geometric pitch between the plane of rotation and the principal axes of inertia of each blade.

The effects of several parameters on the blade flap-lag stability are examined, including structural damping, structural coupling, pitch-lag and pitch-flap coupling, and the blade <b>feathering</b> <b>motion.</b> The trailing edge blowing can {{have a major impact on}} the blade aeroelastic stability, which should be considered in the rotor design.

40|$|Rotor blade {{feathering}} moments {{caused by}} the gyroscopic forces acting during helicopter pitching and rolling motions are identified. The consequent blade elastic <b>feathering</b> <b>motion</b> incurred by these moments are shown to give rise to blade flapping which reduces the pitch/roll cross-coupling due to the aerodynamic effects of pitch and roll motions. For blades of low feathering stiffness this reduction is considerable. Inclusion of this effect into rotor analysis can account {{for much of the}} difference between calculated cross-coupling and observed flight behaviour. This suggests that 'dynamic inflow' or other effects introduced to explain these discrepancies, should be re-evaluated. The 'Bell Bar' rotor system is reviewed and it is shown that the stabiliser bar may be considered {{as an extension of the}} rotor blade, and gyroscopic feathering moments are a fundamental reason for its operation as a beneficial influence on helicopter flight behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to clarify generation mechanism of aerodynamic force of flapping airfoil imitating insect’s flight. Hovering flights are important to develop micro air vehicles (MAV) for rescue inquiry devices of disaster area. In order to understand hovering flights of insects, aerodynamic lifting force and flow field around a flapping machine was measured by using time-series analysis of PIV and numerical simulation. PIV measurements were carried out with the flapping machine which was 10 times expanding model of real insects. Experimental results showed a flapping airfoil holds a strong vorticity near the bottom dead center. The leading-edge vortex and the wake-capture process were observed by the PIV measurement, which are important to understand insect’s flight. Moreover, these processes generate large amount of aerodynamic force compare to the sinusoidal flapping motion. It reveals that <b>feathering</b> <b>motion</b> is important to realize the hovering flight...|$|E
40|$|Multi-wing {{hovering}} and gliding flapping Micro Air Vehicles (�MAV�) are disclosed. The MAV {{can have}} independent wing control to provide enhance {{energy efficiency and}} high maneuverability. Power to each wing can be controlled separately by varying the amplitude of the wing flapping, {{the frequency of the}} wing flapping, or both. The flapping frequency can be controlled such that it is at or near the natural frequency of the wings for improved energy efficiency. The wings can be controlled by a gear train, coil-magnet arrangement or many other actuation systems that enable variable frequency flapping, variable amplitude flapping, or a combination of both. The gear train mechanism provides gyroscopic stability during flight. The wing flapping can include a rotation, or <b>feathering</b> <b>motion,</b> for improved efficiency. The wings can be transitioned between flapping flight and fixed wing flight to enable gliding and hovering in a single configuration. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|E
40|$|During August 1939 {{a series}} of flight tests was made at Langley Field on the Wilford sea gyroplane, {{designated}} by the Navy as the XOZ- 1. These tests were intended to permit rough evaluation of the stability and control characteristics of the machine, with particular reference to possible improvements in rigging which might be made in future machines with fixed wing and nonarticulated feathering control rotor, and to provide data on the bending and <b>feathering</b> <b>motions</b> of the rotor blades. The tests made in 1939 proved inadequate, chiefly because the machine as flown did not have sufficient propeller thrust to give it an appreciable speed range in steady flight. Further tests were therefore made in August 1940 after overhauling the engine and substituting a metal propeller for the wooded one first used. The range of speeds covered in steady flight was markedly extended. Steady-flight runs only were made in this series, since {{it was felt that}} takeoffs and landings had been covered sufficiently in the previous tests...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the feasibility of a highly efficient flapping system {{that is capable of}} avian maneuvers such as rapid takeoff, hover and gliding, numerical and experimental studies have been conducted on the flapping wing kinematics and aerodynamics, and on the mechanization and design requirements for a bird-like micro aerial vehicle (MAV). An unsteady viscous flow simulation has been performed using a 3 D Navier-Stokes code in investigating the effects of dynamic stall phenomenon on the propulsive efficiency, thrust, and lift of the flapping wing. A mechanical flapping-wing micro aerial vehicle that utilizes both the flapping and feathering characteristics of a typical pigeon (Columba livia) has been successfully constructed, and has indicated excellent aerodynamic performance during preliminary wind tunnel testing. The flapping-feathering mechanism employed in this MAV model has been synthesized and constructed so as to best describe the properly coordinated flapping and <b>feathering</b> <b>motions</b> of the wing at an optimum phase angle difference of 90 o in a horizontal steady level flight condition...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} passive system to control the output of {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} with teeter and feather mechanism of the blade. When the power generation system with variable speed is applied to the horizontal axis wind turbine, the rotaion speed of rotor increases with the wind speed. This mechanism can suppress the excessive input power in case of excessive wind speed more than the rated wind speed. This mechanism has two kinds of blade motions which are the teetering and the <b>feathering</b> <b>motions.</b> Both motions are coupled together by the special parts. When the blade is teetered downstream, the pitch angle of the blade (feathering angle) is changed to increase the attack angle. Also, these two kind of motions are supported by the spring and the damper which are attached to the mechanism. In this paper the relationships between the ratio of teetering and feathering angles and the braking effect of wind turbine are investigated experimentally. As the result, it is found that the braking effect for rotor is more excellent when the ratio of feathering and teetering is large. Also, the flow pattern around wind turbine is measured by LDV with two dimensions and visualized by tuft grid method and fog method using Laser sheet. It is found that the suppress phenomena of excessive rotation speed is caused by a couple of ring vortices, which are appeared on the area of blade tip side...|$|R
40|$|With the {{evolution}} of advanced composites, the feasibility of designing bearingless rotor systems for high speed, demanding maneuver envelopes, and high aircraft gross weights has become a reality. These systems {{eliminate the need for}} hinges and heavily loaded bearings by incorporating a composite flexbeam structure which accommodates flapping, lead-lag, and <b>feathering</b> <b>motions</b> by bending and twisting while reacting full blade centrifugal force. The flight characteristics of a bearingless rotor system are largely dependent on hub design, and the principal element in this type of system is the composite flexbeam. As in any hub design, trade off studies must be performed in order to optimize performance, dynamics (stability), handling qualities, and stresses. However, since the flexbeam structure is the primary component which will determine the balance of these characteristics, its design and fabrication are not straightforward. It was concluded that: pitchcase and snubber damper representations are required in the flexbeam model for proper sizing resulting from dynamic requirements; optimization is necessary for flexbeam design, since it reduces the design iteration time and results in an improved design; and inclusion of multiple flight conditions and their corresponding fatigue allowables is necessary for the optimization procedure...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} here provides a comprehensive dynamic and aerodynamic helicopter model. The possible applications {{of this work}} are wide including, control systems applications, reference and trajectory tracking methods implementation amongst others. The model configuration corresponds to a Sikorsky helicopter; a main rotor in perpendicular combination with a tail rotor. Also, a particular model of unmanned aerial vehicle has been modelled as part of collaboration with the La Laguna University (Spain). The modelling tool is VehicleSim, a program that builds rigid body systems, solves the nonlinear equations of motion and generates the time histories of the corresponding state variables of the vehicle under study. VehicleSim is able to provide the linearised equations of motion in a Matlab file and the symbolic state-space model. This is useful when control systems are to be designed. The main rotor model accounts for flap, lag and <b>feather</b> <b>motions</b> for each blade {{as well as for}} their nonlinear dynamic coupling. The tail rotor is modelled including the flap-feather coupling via delta three angle. The main and tail rotors' angular velocities are implemented by PID controllers. Main rotor linear and nonlinear equations are derived and validated by comparison with the theory. Main rotor flap and lag degrees of freedom are validated using frequency domain approaches in the absence of external forces. Also, fuselage-main rotor interaction is studied and validated by using modal analysis and root locus methodology. Vibrations originated at the main rotor are simulated and their effects on the fuselage are examined by a Short Time Fourier transformation. The aerodynamic model uses blade element theory on the main-tail rotors. Hover, climb, descent and forward flight conditions are simulated and they allow the helicopter to follow certain trajectories. Finally, the ensuing vibrations when an external perturbation is applied to the main rotor are investigated...|$|R

Each blade of the rotor has three degrees of freedom: flapping, lagging and <b>feathering.</b> The <b>motions</b> after each degree of freedom are also known for all blades. The blade is modelled as a thin vortex surface. The wakes are free fluid surfaces. A system of five equations are obtained: {{the first one is}} the integral equation of the lifting surface (rotor), the next three describe the wakes motion, and the last one relates the vortex strength on the wakes and the variation of vorticity on the rotor. A numerical solution of this system is presented. To avoid the singularities that can occur due to the complexity of vortex system, a desingularized model of the vortex core was adopted. A Mathcad worksheet containing the method has been written. The original contribution of the work.

40|$|In this paper, an {{ornithopter}} prototype that {{mimics the}} flapping motion of bird flight is developed, and the lift and thrust generation characteristics of different wing designs are evaluated. This project {{focused on the}} spar arrangement and material used for the wings that could achieves improved performance. Various lift and thrust measurement techniques are explored and evaluated. Various wings of insects and birds were evaluated to understand how these natural flyers with flapping wings are able to produce sufficient lift to fly. The differences in the flapping aerodynamics were also detailed. Experiments on different wing designs and materials were conducted and a paramount wing was built for a test flight. The first prototype has a length of 46. 5 cm, wing span of 88 cm, and weighs 161 g. A mechanism which produced a flapping motion was fabricated and designed to create flapping flight. The flapping flight was produced by using a single motor and a flexible and light wing structure. A force balance made of load cell was then designed to measure the thrust and lift force of the ornithopter. Three sets of wings varying flexibility were fabricated, therefore lift and thrust measurements were acquired from each different set of wings. The lift will be measured in ten cycles computing the average lift and frequency in three different speeds or frequencies (slow, medium and fast). The thrust measurement was measure likewise but in two cycles only. Several observations were made regarding the behavior of flexible flapping wings that should aid {{in the design of}} future flexible flapping wing vehicles. The wings angle or phase characteristic were analyze too and studied. The final ornithopter prototype weighs only 160 g, has a wing span of 88. 5 cm, that could flap at a maximum flapping frequency of 3. 869 Hz, and produce a maximum thrust and lift of about 0. 719 and 0. 264 N respectively. Next, we proposed resonance type flapping wing utilizes the near resonance phenomenon of a two-degree of freedom elastic system, that is, the wing is supported by the springs for flapping and <b>feathering</b> <b>motions.</b> Being oscillated close to the resonance frequency of the system, only by the torque in flapping motion, the amplitude gained is a few times higher than that of normal case. The first prototype was made from acrylic using a laser cutting machine. The wings were made up of carbon rods and kite material Ripstop. First test showed that the wings were too heavy for the mechanism to work. The third prototype was a smaller single gear crank design which was fabricated using a 3 D printer. Initial test proved that the second prototype could withstand the high frequency flapping and near resonance amplitude as designed. With remote control, the third prototype was able to take off, climb, cruise and land in flapping mode successfully...|$|R
40|$|Birds 2 ̆ 019 unique {{characteristics}} such as wing shape, flexibility, <b>feathers,</b> flapping <b>motion,</b> etc., result in high aerodynamic performance. Using various flight modes such as gliding, bounding, and flapping, birds can use a single propulsion system for multiple functions. In low Reynolds number flyers using flapping flight mechanisms, the contribution of unsteady effects on lift and drag is not entirely understood. To gain insight about the unsteady contributions, a controlled study on the near wake flow behind freely flying birds was performed. Long duration, time resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV), combined with high speed imaging {{has been used to}} characterize the various flow features in the wake that are associated with flapping flight. The specially designed PIV system can sample the flow field for twenty minutes yielding a continuous measurement, sampling several wingbeat cycles consecutively. Time series of the vorticity fields have been expressed as composite wake plots, which reveal various characteristics of the wake during the upstroke (US) and down stroke (DS) phase of the flapping as well as the transition between US to DS and vice versa. Comparison between the near wake fields behind the three birds show remarkable similarity in their wake structure. We have identified over multiple wing beat cycles the presence of what appears to be an overlap of two distinct wakes during the transition from US toDS, named 2 ̆ 01 cdouble branch 2 ̆ 01 d. Over the region of the double branch, the majority of net positive circulation is accumulated. Indicating this may be a key feature in producing lift, and thus contribute to the observed high aerodynamic performance. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

However, the morphological and kinematic features of flying vertebrates {{are still the}} underappreciated aspects of locomotor control designs for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In this work we introduce Bat Bot, in short B 2, shown in Fig. 1 -(a), which is a biologically inspired articulated-winged micro aerial vehicle {{that is capable of}} mimicking a variety of motions and maneuvers, including but not limited to steady level flight without a conventional tail, rapid turning, inverse perching and hovering. To achieve such goals, biologic bats were examined to determine certain key morphological features of B 2. Because of the inefficiency of electric actuators compared to the biologic muscles of these mammals, certain compromises have to be made to enable B 2 for self-sustained flight. (a) B 2 (b) (c) Fig. 1 : (a) B 2, articulated-winged bat robot. (b,c) The wing articulation in bat, [2]. For a comparable performance to real bats, B 2 is designed to have a wingspan of 40 cm, and a gross weight of 60 ± 20 g, which approximately will resemble Rousettus aegyptiacus, [3]. Although real bats are reported to have more than 35 degrees of freedom (DoF) on each wing, B 2 will incorporate 3 -DoF – flapping, feathering, and extension – on each forelimb, and 2 -DoF – pitch and lead-lag – on each hindlimb. Overall mechanism with 5 -DoF per wing can flap at approximately 10 Hz and can modulate the wingspan, sweep pitch angle, and wing cambering. Turning to the actuators, B 2 has a synchronous flapping mechanism which is driven by a 5 gr brush-less motor and a 3 D-printed planetary gear box with a 1 : 36 gear reduction ratio.
