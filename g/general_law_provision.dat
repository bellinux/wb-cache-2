40|$|This paper aims to be a {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} special seizure as a safety measure, as it is regulated in Romanian special criminal legislation, and also a way to highlight certain discrepancies between the general and special criminal legislation. Special seizure, as a safety measure, may be disposed under Criminal Code regulations, as a general norm, but also under some stipulations included in special Criminal laws. Moreover, when there are such special stipulations, they have under the rules of specialty principle, priority in implementing to the general norm. In our opinion, in these cases, special seizure is also disposed under the Criminal Code provisions, as general norm, because the general terms nondescript by others field of incidence, {{are the ones who}} set by the Criminal law. In fact, in such cases, the special seizure is ordered under both Criminal provisions. In analysis of the paper, is made reference to the applicability of special seizure measure inmatter of corruption offences, in customs, money laundering, illicit trafficking of drugs and fisheries and fish farming, {{and as a result of}} their presentation, we concluded that although is in question the specialty principle, mainly would find application the general norm in comparison with special norm. Moreover, corroborating the actually general norm with the provisions of the New Criminal Code, we believe the special seizure, should operate exclusively under the <b>general</b> <b>law,</b> or the <b>provisions</b> of the special norm, should be modified...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{competition policy}} and antimonopoly <b>law</b> <b>provisions</b> {{with respect to}} regional integration. The international aspects of competition policy and antimonopoly law can take a variety of forms. With regard to the forms of agreement between countries, we compare bilateral agreements (focusing on bilateral cooperation and mutual assistance agreements) and multilateral agreements (focusing on the WTO) with agreements that adopt the form of regional integration, and through this we highlight aspects such as the characteristics, content, and functions of competition policies and antimonopoly <b>law</b> <b>provisions</b> in regional integration agreements. By means of a survey of regional integration agreements, we ascertain that {{with regard to their}} substantive provisions and their procedural provisions, two types exist in parallel: a type with strong functions for promoting the enactment of legislation and promoting their sharing by the participating countries, and a weak type that lacks these functions. Through this we can see that the regional integration format can combine the characteristics both of the bilateral agreement format and the multilateral agreement format. In addition, the process of regional integration can be understood as being that as the degree of integration increases, there is a progressive adoption of common competition policy and antimonopoly law and of central executive institutions, the more so when the integration is between developed nations. However, even in cases of integration between developed countries in which the degree of integration is advanced, there are some that try to maintain a high degree of commonality of competition policy and antimonopoly <b>law</b> <b>provisions</b> among the participating countries, without {{going so far as to}} have central executive institutions or common antimonopoly <b>law</b> <b>provisions,</b> while even in cases of integration by developing countries there are some that endeavor to adopt a form in which they have common antimonopoly <b>law</b> and other <b>provisions.</b> This paper further examines the characteristics of competition policies and antimonopoly <b>law</b> <b>provisions</b> in regional collaboration pacts and other agreements that Japan has concluded. Based on the above analysis of the background, content, administration, and other aspects of integration, it is possible to make meaningful suggestions as to the wealth of possibilities for the desirable forms that competition policy and antimonopoly <b>law</b> <b>provisions</b> should take in cases of regional integration, and as to the desirable forms of such provisions in cases of regional integration in which Japan is involved. ...|$|R
