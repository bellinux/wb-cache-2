However, these are not officially declared quantified measurement, and they are estimations based on the respondents’ standards.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{relationships}} between crude oil prices, <b>financial</b> <b>performances</b> and share prices of 233 studied oil and gas producers. Hamilton's (2003) study emphasized the significant correlation between increases in crude oil prices and US recessions. Hamilton (2010) {{also pointed out that}} almost all major economic downturns have been immediately preceded by a significant rise in oil prices. This study collects and uses all of the 233 worldwide listed oil and gas producers’ monthly, quarterly and yearly accounting (Book Value, Earnings Per Share and Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) and stock market information that could be found in the Datastream Advance database. This study has assessed and analyzed the impacts of crude oil prices on both the studied firms’ <b>financial</b> <b>performances</b> and their share prices. The empirical evidence suggested a significant positive correlation amongst crude oil prices and the studied firms' stock market <b>performances</b> and their <b>financial</b> <b>performances.</b> A significant and very strong correlation also exists between the studied firms' <b>financial</b> <b>performances</b> and their stock market performances. This finding is aligned with that studied for the forward relationship between crude oil prices and the stock market performances. An increase in crude oil prices leads to a higher stock market revenues, and vice versa, a falling crude oil prices cause a decrease in their market share values...|$|R

5|$|Pillsbury's {{management}} {{made several}} attempts at reorganization or {{restructuring of the}} restaurant chain in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The most prominent change came in 1978 when Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. In a plan called Operation Phoenix, Smith initiated a restructuring of corporate business practices {{at all levels of}} the company. Changes to the company included updated franchise agreements, a broadening of the menu, and new store designs to standardize the look and feel of the company. While these efforts were initially effective, many of them were eventually discarded, resulting in Burger King falling into a fiscal slump that damaged the <b>financial</b> <b>performance</b> of both Burger King and its parent. Poor operating performance and ineffectual leadership continued to bog the company down for many years, even after it was acquired in 1989 by the British entertainment conglomerate Grand Metropolitan and its successor Diageo. Eventually, the institutional neglect of the brand by Diageo damaged the company to the point where major franchises were driven out of business and its total value was significantly decreased. Diageo eventually decided to divest itself of the loss-making chain and put the company up for sale in 2000.|$|E
