5|$|In 1888, Nobel was {{astonished}} to read his own obituary, titled The merchant of death is dead, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> newspaper. As it was Alfred's brother Ludvig who had died, the obituary was eight years premature. The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered. This inspired him to change his will. On 10 December 1896, Alfred Nobel died in his villa in San Remo, Italy, from a cerebral haemorrhage. He was 63 years old.|$|E

Second Lieutenant Barfoot-Saunt removed some small pieces from the wreck to accompany his report, illustrating technical points.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1925, {{relations}} grew tense between al-Kharrat {{and other}} rebel leaders, particularly Sa'id al-'As and Ramadan al-Shallash, as they traded accusations of plundering villages or extorting local inhabitants. Al-Kharrat continued to lead operations in the Ghouta, where he was ultimately killed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> ambush. The revolt dissipated by 1927, but he gained a lasting reputation as a martyr of the Syrian resistance to French rule.|$|E

5|$|After {{his earlier}} crash Downie retired {{on the third}} lap with a broken wheel, while Thornycroft, who had also had first lap trouble, was forced to stop with a broken rear axle. Over the final two laps a number of cars ran out of fuel, and of the 42 {{starters}} only 18 completed the race. The first car to finish was the Rolls Royce of Percy Northey. He had started twenty minutes ahead of Napier's Arrol-Johnston so Napier had to finish within twenty minutes of Northey in order to win. He did so, passing the finish line eighteen minutes later, having run the fastest lap of the race at the end to win by just over two minutes. Napier's time was 6 hours 9 minutes 14.6 seconds, followed by Northey in 6:11:23 and Norman Littlejohn <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> Vinot-Deguingand, in 6:14:32.4. The three drivers had been consistently the quickest throughout the race and were separated by just over five minutes. The next quickest driver was E. J. C. Roberts in {{the second of the}} Arrol-Johnstons, but he was over 25 minutes behind his victorious team-mate.|$|E
5|$|By his standards, Roger Federer had a weak season: {{he failed}} to win a Grand Slam tournament title {{for the first time}} since 2002, losing to Nadal for the fourth time <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> Open final, and the sixth time overall in Major finals. He dropped to world No. 4 in November, the first time he had been ranked outside the top 3 since 2002. Federer's drop was caused by Murray's {{remarkable}} run of form in Asia in October, winning three successive titles. However, Federer rallied, winning his three final tournaments (a sign of things to come in the subsequent season), including the World Tour Finals, which was enough to secure an end-of-season ranking of No. 3. Murray, meanwhile, was making significant improvements to his game and made the semifinals of all four Grand Slam tournaments, with his best result a defeat in the Australian Open final against Djokovic. He ended the year with two ATP World Tour Masters 1000 titles for the fourth consecutive year, and five titles in total.|$|E
5|$|Daoíz {{volunteered to}} help defend Ceuta against the Moors in 1790 {{and was given}} command of an {{artillery}} battery. He remained in North Africa {{to assist with the}} defence of Oran in 1791, spending part of the time with a unit of miners. Daoíz was commended by his superiors, including artillery Brigadier Andres Aznar, for his courage and zeal in the battles and was promoted to lieutenant on 28 February 1792. After Spain joined the First Coalition against Revolutionary France, Daoíz participated in the War of Roussillon, in the Pyrenees, from March 1794 but was captured <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>French</b> counterattack on 25 November 1794. He was held as a prisoner of war at Toulouse where he turned down an offer of freedom and a commission in the French Army, which was short of artillery officers. After the Peace of Basel ended the war between France and Spain on 22 July 1795, Daoíz was released and made his way back to El Puerto de Santa Maria.|$|E
