Among others a new type of ellipsoidal modulated binary stars were found.

40|$|The {{couplings}} between supermassive black-hole binaries {{and their}} environments within galactic nuclei {{have been well}} studied {{as part of the}} search for solutions to the final parsec problem. The scattering of stars by the binary or the interaction with a circumbinary disk may efficiently drive the system to sub-parsec separations, allowing the binary to enter a regime where the emission of gravitational waves can drive it to merger within a Hubble time. However, these interactions can also affect the orbital parameters of the binary. In particular, they may drive an increase in binary eccentricity which survives until the system's gravitational-wave signal enters the pulsar-timing array band. Therefore, if we can measure the eccentricity from observed signals, we can potentially deduce some of the properties of the binary environment. To this end, we build on previous techniques to present a general Bayesian pipeline with which we can detect and estimate the parameters of an eccentric supermassive black-hole binary system with pulsar-timing arrays. Additionally, we generalize the pulsar-timing array F_e-statistic to <b>eccentric</b> <b>systems,</b> and show that both this statistic and the Bayesian pipeline are robust when studying circular or arbitrarily <b>eccentric</b> <b>systems.</b> We explore how eccentricity influences the detection prospects of single gravitational-wave sources, as well as the detection penalty incurred by employing a circular waveform template to search for eccentric signals, and conclude by identifying important avenues for future study.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that a natural consequence of an asymmetric kick imparted to neutron stars at birth {{is that the}} majority of double neutron star binaries should possess highly eccentric orbits. This leads to greatly accelerated orbital decay, due to the enormous increase in the emission of gravitational radiation at periastron as originally demonstrated by Peters. A uniform distribution of kick velocities constrained to the orbital plane of the pre-supernova binary would result in 24 % of surviving binaries coalescing at least 10, 000 times faster than a circular orbit system. Even if the planar kick constraint is lifted, 6 % of bound systems still coalesce this rapidly. In a nonnegligible fraction of cases it may even be possible that the system could coalesce within 10 years of the final supernova, resulting in what might resemble a "double supernova. " For systems like the progenitor of PSR J 0737 - 3039 A, this number is as high as 9 % (in the planar kick model). Whether the kick velocity distribution extends to the range required to achieve this is still unclear. We do know that the observed population of binary pulsars has a deficit of highly <b>eccentric</b> <b>systems</b> at small orbital periods. In contrast, the long-period systems favor large eccentricities, as expected. We argue that this is because the short-period highly <b>eccentric</b> <b>systems</b> have already coalesced and are thus selected against by pulsar surveys. This effect needs {{to be taken into account}} when using the scale-factor method to estimate the coalescence rate of double neutron star binaries.

40|$|As the {{brightest}} O-type X-ray {{source in the}} Carina nebula, HD 93250 (O 4 III(fc)) is X-ray overluminous for its spectral type and has an unusually hard X-ray spectrum. Two different scenarios have been invoked to explain its X-ray properties: wind-wind interaction and magnetic wind confinement. Yet, HD 93250 shows absolutely constant radial velocities over time scales of years suggesting either a single star, a binary system seen pole-one or a very long period and/or highly <b>eccentric</b> <b>system.</b> Using the ESO Very Large Telescope Interferometer, we resolved HD 93250 as a close pair with similar components. We measured a near-infrared flux ratio of 0. 8 +/- 0. 1 and a separation of 1. 5 +/- 0. 2 x 10 E- 03 arcsec. At the distance of Carina, this corresponds to a projected physical distance of 3. 5 A. U. While a quantitative investigation would require a full characterization of the orbit, the binary nature of HD 93250 allows us to qualitatively explain both its X-ray flux and hardness and its non-thermal radio emission {{in the framework of}} a colliding wind scenario. We also discuss various observational biases.

40|$|We study a {{model of}} of the binary system LS I+ 61 ◦ 303 in which its radio to TeV {{emission}} is due to interaction of a relativistic wind from a young pulsar with the wind from its companion Be star. We find the detailed structure of the stellar wind is crucial for explaining {{the properties of the}} system. The fast polar wind is clumpy, as typical for radiatively-driven winds. The clumpiness causes the two winds to mix rather than forming a bow shock spatially separating them. The relativistic electrons from the pulsar wind are retained in the moving clumps by magnetic field inhomogeneities, which explains the X-ray variability on time scales much shorter than the orbital period. The second stellar-wind component is a dense equatorial disc around the Be star. The energy losses of the relativistic electrons at energies at which they emit radio and X-rays are dominated by Coulomb interactions within the disc, causing radio and X-ray orbital modulations of this <b>eccentric</b> <b>system.</b> On the other hand, a likely mechanism of the TeV orbital modulation is an emission anisotropy, with preferred directions along the surface of equal ram pressures of the two winds.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a model where {{a violent}} periastron collision {{of stars in}} an eccentric binary system induces an eruption or explosion seen as a brief transient source, attributed to LBVs, SN impostors, or other transients. The key ingredient is that an evolved primary increases its photospheric radius on relatively short timescales, {{to a point where}} the radius is comparable to or larger than the periastron separation in an eccentric binary. In such a configuration, a violent and sudden collision would ensue, possibly leading to substantial mass ejection instead of a binary merger. Repeated periastral grazings in an <b>eccentric</b> <b>system</b> could quickly escalate to a catastrophic encounter, wherein the companion star actually plunges deep inside the photosphere of a bloated primary during periastron, {{as a result of the}} primary star increasing its own radius. This is motivated by the case of η Carinae, where such a collision must have occured if conventional estimates of the present-day orbit are correct, and where brief peaks in the light curve coincide with periastron. Stellar collisions may explain brief recurring LBV outbursts like SN 2000 ch and SN 2009 ip, and perhaps outbursts from relatively low-mass progenitor stars (collisons are not necessarily the exclusive domain of very luminous stars). Finally, mass ejections induced repeatedly at periastron cause orbital evolution; this may explain the origin of very eccentric colliding-wind Wolf-Rayet binaries such as WR 140.

The torsionally coupled system is considered as one-way <b>eccentric</b> <b>system.</b> The eccentricity {{considered in the}} system is accidental eccentricity only. The performance of single tuned mass damper (TMD) optimally designed without considering the torsion is investigated for the torsionally coupled system {{and found that the}} effectiveness of a single TMD is significantly reduced due to torsion in the system. However, the design of TMD system without considering the torsion is only justified for torsionally stiff systems. Further, the optimum parameters of a single TMD considering the accidental eccentricity are obtained using numerical searching technique for different values of uncoupled torsional to lateral frequency ratio and aspect ratio of the system. The optimally designed single TMD system is found to be less effective for torsionally coupled system in comparison to uncoupled system. This {{is due to the fact}} that a torsionally coupled system has two natural frequencies of vibration, as a result, at least two TMDs are required which can control both lateral and torsional response of the system. The optimum damper parameters of different alternate arrangements such as (i) two identical TMDs placed at opposite corners, (ii) two independent TMDs and (iii) four TMDs are evaluated for minimum response of the system. The comparative performance of the above TMDs arrangements is also studied for both torsionally coupled and uncoupled systems.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the magnetic fields of late-type stars and their close-by planets may produce stellar flares as observed in active binary systems. However, in spite of several claims, conclusive evidence is still lacking. We estimate the magnetic energy available in the interaction using analytical models to provide an upper bound to the expected flare energy. We investigate three different mechanisms leading to magnetic energy release. The first two can release an energy up to (0. 2 - 1. 2) B^ 2 _ 0 R^ 3 /μ, where B_ 0 is the surface field of the star, R its radius, and μ the magnetic permeability of the plasma. They operate in young active stars whose coronae have closed magnetic field lines up to the distance of their close-by planets that can trigger the energy release. The third mechanism operates in weakly or moderately active stars having a coronal field with predominantly open field lines at the distance of their planets. The released energy is {{of the order of}} (0. 002 - 0. 1) B^ 2 _ 0 R^ 3 /μ and depends on the ratio of the planetary to the stellar fields, thus allowing an indirect measurement of the former when the latter is known. We compute the released energy for different separations of the planet and different stellar parameters finding the conditions for the operation of the proposed mechanisms. An application to eight selected systems is presented. The computed energies and dissipation timescales are in agreement with flare observations in the <b>eccentric</b> <b>system</b> HD 17156 and in the circular systems HD 189733 and HD 179949.

40|$|The unparalleled {{photometric}} {{data obtained}} by NASA's Kepler space telescope led to an improved understanding of red giant stars and binary stars. Seismology allows us to constrain the properties of red giants. In addition to eclipsing binaries, eccentric non-eclipsing binaries, exhibiting ellipsoidal modulations, have been detected with Kepler. We aim to study the properties of <b>eccentric</b> binary <b>systems</b> containing a red giant star and derive {{the parameters of the}} primary giant component. We apply asteroseismic techniques to determine masses and radii of the primary component of each system. For a selected target, light and radial velocity curve modelling techniques are applied to extract the parameters of the system. The effects of stellar on the binary system are studied. The paper presents the asteroseismic analysis of 18 pulsating red giants in <b>eccentric</b> binary <b>systems,</b> for which masses and radii were constrained. The orbital periods of these systems range from 20 to 440 days. From radial velocity measurements we find eccentricities between e= 0. 2 to 0. 76. As a case study we present a detailed analysis of KIC 5006817. From seismology we constrain the rotational period of the envelope to be at least 165 d, roughly twice the orbital period. The stellar core rotates 13 times faster than the surface. From the spectrum and radial velocities we expect that the Doppler beaming signal should have a maximum amplitude of 300 ppm in the light curve. Through binary modelling, we determine the mass of the secondary component to be 0. 29 ± 0. 03 M_. For KIC 5006817 we exclude pseudo-synchronous rotation of the red giant with the orbit. The comparison of the results from seismology and modelling of the light curve shows a possible alignment of the rotational and orbital axis at the 2 σ level.

We present a total of 598 high-resolution echelle spectra from our robotic facility STELLA from 2006 - 2012 which we used to compute orbital elements of unprecedented accuracy. The orbit constrains the eccentricity to 0. 97608 +/- 0. 00004 and the orbital period to 889. 8195 +/- 0. 0003 d. The masses of the two components are 0. 87 +/- 0. 05 Msun and 0. 58 +/- 0. 03 Msun if the inclination is 5 +/- 1. 5 degr as determined from adaptive-optics images, that is good to only 6 % due to the error of the inclination although the minimum masses reached a precision of 0. 3 %.

Sinusoidal modulations of Teff of Aa with an amplitude of apprx 55 K are seen with the orbital period.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Muitiregion annular {{geometry}} {{is a basic}} {{feature of}} energy removal systems ranging from advanced heat exchangers to fission reactor fuel rods. For the symmetric cases, the heat conduction through annular regions is well defined. However, for a shift of an annular region, analysis of the system must be made in two dimensions. The {{purpose of this study}} is to characterize the steady state heat conduction through eccentric annuli through a theoretical, numerical, and experimental investigation. In the theoretical study, the analytical solutions are sought for the governing heat conduction equations. Separate polar coordinate systems are used to describe the points in the inner tube, the annular region, and the outer tube. Particular attention is given to the interface conditions by explicitly retaining continuity of the components of the heat flux vector. Within the context of the specified assumptions, the resulting solutions are general, valid for any size annular regions and any degree of eccentricity. The boundary condition on the outer tube surface can be specified by either a prescribed temperature function of angle or a convective boundary condition. A computer program is developed to perform the calculations of the two-dimensional temperature profiles within the <b>eccentric</b> <b>system.</b> This program can be verified mathematically for the concentric condition. The experimental study is designed to verify the program for eccentric situations. The experiment is a straightforward determination of the two-dimensional temperature field within the eccentric annuli. An electrical heater rod is used in the experiment. A PVC pipe is chosen as the outer tube. For the intermediate annular region, standard hard lead shot is utilized. The thermal conductivity of the packed bed of lead shot is relatively insensitive over the temperature range of interest, and the thermal conductivity of the PVC pipe is constant over the temperature range used. The study of the results between the analytical solutions and the measurements indicate that the temperature profiles within the system can be accurately predicted if an appropriate boundary condition is used. In addition to the theoretical and experimental phases, numerical aspects of the problem are also studied. Four general approaches have been used to treat the problem. The first is to approximate the heater rod surface by a ratchet. This results in an increase in the number of radial node regions required and a subsequent loss of economy. The second approach utilizes concentric regions and defines a variable conductivity within the annulus region to account for the eccentric condition. This reduces the number of radial node regions and results in saving in both computation time and core space. To eliminate the common limitation in both approaches that the eccentric displacement must be smaller than the radius of heater rod, a third approach is developed. This approach utilizes a two-dimensional, cylindrical model in which the origin of the coordinate system is located at the center of the heater rod. However, if an existing general purpose finite difference code is used, an additional effort is required to translate the temperature profiles to a new coordinate system with the origin located at the center of outer tube. An existing finite element computer code is utilized as the fourth numerical approach. A relatively coarser grid system can be used in this code and less computer running time is required...|$|E
40|$|White dwarfs are {{ubiquitous}} in the known Universe. They are frequently found in binary systems with ordinary stars, giants, or compact objects as companions. Depending upon their histories, such systems may have significantly eccentric orbits. Because of gravitational radiation, a white dwarf-compact object binary will shrink and circularize with time. If {{the system is}} initially close enough, then the inspiral will occur on a time-scale shorter than a Hubble time. As an <b>eccentric</b> <b>system</b> inspirals, it will pass through resonances when harmonics of the orbital period match one of the white dwarf's normal mode eigenfrequencies. At these tidal resonances, energy can be transferred from the orbit to the white dwarf normal modes, and the system will pass through a sequence of such resonances for each mode. If the amplitude of a mode is driven high enough, the modes may damp due to non-linear processes and heat the white dwarf. If {{the temperature of the}} white dwarf can be raised in this way to a critical value, then the star may undergo a thermonuclear detonation that results in a Type Ia supernova. In order to determine whether such a scenario is possible, and what other observable consequences of tidal resonances may be, it is necessary to understand the resonant energy transfer and the non-linear evolution of modes on a white dwarf in some detail. A variational approach to the excitation of dynamical tides is presented. This is then used to study the energy transfer in the resonant excitation of tides. The energy transfer problem is {{complicated by the fact that}} a mode perturbs the orbit as it is resonantly excited, effectively creating a non-linear feedback loop. We call this effect 'back reaction. ' In the present work, the problem is considered both in the approximation when back reaction is neglected, and when it is included. It is found that back reaction changes the resonant energy transfer both qualitatively and quantitatively. In particular, unlike the no back reaction case, the energy transfer with back reaction is shown to be always positive to lowest order in the rate of dissipation by gravitational radiation, and any initial energy in the mode before resonance is shown to increase the energy transfer. Numerical simulations of resonant mode excitation and non-linear evolution of white dwarf oscillations are also considered. An adiabatic, parallel hydrodynamic code is described for this. Results from several test problems and preliminary simulations of resonant tidal excitation are presented. The formalism developed for resonant tidal excitation is applied to studying the feasibility of a tidally triggered supernova via resonant excitation of quadrupolar f-modes. It is found that a 1. 4 solar mass companion to the white dwarf is not viable, which rules out double degenerates and white dwarf-neutron star binaries as potential progenitors. However, it is found that with a companion mass of ten to hundred thousand solar masses, there exist regions in the parameter space where the white dwarf can be detonated before tidal disruption. It is calculated that the ejecta from such a detonation would remain trapped in orbit around the companion for the majority of cases, and would presumably be accreted eventually. A preliminary calculation of the importance of tidal effects for gravitational wave observations of capture sources with central masses of about a million solar masses is also presented. The resonant excitation of f-modes is found to be unimportant because of the long orbital periods at the last stable orbits. It is, however, found that the excitation of g-modes could introduce significant errors in the parameter estimation for such systems, though it would probably not affect detection capability. The exact magnitude of the errors depends upon the density of resonances during the period of observation, and therefore depends upon details of the white dwarf model...|$|E

40|$|We have {{identified}} 21 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in globular cluster Terzan 5 {{by using the}} Green Bank Telescope, bringing the total of known MSPs in Terzan 5 to 24. These discoveries confirm fundamental predictions of globular cluster and binary system evolution. Thirteen of the new MSPs are in binaries, of which two show eclipses and two have highly eccentric orbits. The relativistic periastron advance for the two <b>eccentric</b> <b>systems</b> indicates {{that at least one}} of these pulsars has a mass 1. 68 times greater than the mass of the Sun at 95 % confidence. Such large neutron star masses constrain the equation of state of matter at or beyond the nuclear equilibrium density. The extremely high stellar densities (104 to 106 pcj 3) in the cores of globular clusters (GCs) result in stellar interactions that pro-duce and destroy binary systems as well as exchange their members (1).

40|$|Eclipsing {{binary stars}} allow {{the physics of}} the {{component}} stars to be studied. These systems can provide a wealth of knowledge ranging from fundamental parameters such as mass, radius, and luminosity through to tests of stellar evolution and distances to the systems. A search for eclipsing binaries in the SMC using the MOA photometric time series database yielded 169 detections. These detections were cross-referenced with the OGLE catalogue of eclipsing binaries in the SMC. A total of 35 systems were new detections with most of these lying in the outer, less dense regions of the SMC, and some outside the OGLE fields. The remainder were within the overlap region of the fields of the two surveys. In the overlap region of the two MOA survey fields, 21 systems were detected but only 2 detections were common to both fields. This implies the MOA survey is far from complete. Additionally, 14 systems (~ 10 %) were not detected by OGLE in the MOA-OGLE overlap region implying the OGLE survey is also not complete, though to a lesser extent. The unequivocal determination of whether all systems were real eclipsing binaries {{was not able to}} be made based on the photometric light curves alone. Objects for which there was some uncertainty concerning their true nature were indicated as such. Two of the new detections in the MOA SMC catalogue were selected for follow-up photometry, MOA J 005018. 4 - 723855 and MOA J 005623. 5 - 722123. An LMC target was selected from the MACHO LMC catalogue, MACHO* 05 : 36 : 48. 7 - 69 : 17 : 00. Observations were made from MJUO in Strömgren u, Johnson VJ and Cousins IC filters between 1999 April and 2002 July. The McLellan 1 -m telescope and CCD photometer head were used. Differential fluxes for the target stars were extracted using the ISIS- 2. 1 difference imaging package. To obtain flux changes with respect to a level of zero flux, DAOPHOT II was used to establish the targets' flux levels in the reference images relative to which ISIS- 2. 1 works. The light curves were analysed using the Wilson synthetic light-curve code. It was not possible to make a definitive analysis of the physical nature of the three targets based on differential photometry alone. Nevertheless, it was possible to make rough estimates of the systems' apparent magnitudes and hence, via the known distance moduli and reddenings to the Magellanic Clouds, their absolute magnitudes. Coupled with additional constraints derived from Geneva models of stellar evolution for stars of reduced metallicity, it was possible to obtain astrophysically plausible parameters for the component stars comprising each target. The LMC target MACHO* 05 : 36 : 48. 7 - 69 : 17 : 00 is located near the Tarantula nebula and very close to SN 1987 A. It is a well-detached, <b>eccentric</b> <b>system,</b> (e = 0. 2) with a sidereal period of 3. 853529 ± 0. 000005 d and an apsidal period of 100 ± 5 years. The difference in mean epochs for the VJ and u/IC observations resulted in an averaging of the solution parameters. The most astrophysically plausible solution was obtained by matching the derived components to a pair of Geneva LMC models of identical age. This solution indicates a primary of ~ 20 Mסּ and secondary of ~ 14 Mסּ with a common age of 5 x 106 yr. Other parameters are mean effective temperatures Teff, 1 = 33500 K, Teff, 2 = 29500 K, semi-major axis a= 33. 3 Rסּ, mean radii R 1 /a = 0. 21, R 2 /a = 0. 15 and inclination i = 85. 8 º. MOA J 005018. 4 - 723855 is a semi-detached system, period 1. 839870 ± 0. 000005 d, with the secondary filling its Roche lobe and with the O'Connell effect evident in the light curve. Of the three systems, this is the most affected by blending. Third light was necessary to obtain satisfactory light-curve fits in all bandpasses. Light-curve solutions fix the mass ratio and suggest the system is undergoing case A mass transfer from the present secondary. Since the mass receptor in such a system may mimic a normal main-sequence star to within a factor of two in luminosity for a given mass and temperature, an estimate of the physical nature of this system was found by requiring the parameters to match those of a Geneva evolutionary model. This yielded M 1 = 13. 5 Mסּ), Teff, 1 = 29000 K, R 1 = 5. 9 Rסּ), M 2 = 20. 5 Mסּ), Teff, 2 = 20000 K, R 2 = 8. 5 Rסּ), a= 20. 5 Rסּ) and i= 77. 6 °. MOA J 005623. 5 - 722123 is a detached system, period 2. 32005 ± 0. 00002 d. Third light was necessary in the analysis of this star. Analysis of the derived solutions and comparison to the Geneva evolutionary models indicates a system 10 x 106 yr old. The most astrophysically plausible parameters for this system are M 1 = 13. 5 Mסּ), Teff, 1 = 29 000 K, R 1 = 5. 8 Rסּ), M 2 = 15. 5 Mסּ), Teff, 2 = 29350 K, R 1 = 7. 8 Rסּ), a= 22. 65 Rסּ) and i= 87. 8 °. The preferred light curve solution gives a secondary marginally hotter than the primary, yet with shallower eclipse depths. The high inclination as well as the gravity brightening in B-stars are the cause of this. During the secondary eclipse, the primary's path passes across the cooler central region the secondary, thereby leaving the hotter poles exposed. This accounts for the higher hemisphere-averaged temperature in the solution...|$|E
40|$|The X-ray {{emission}} {{from the}} wind-wind collision in short-period massive O+O-star binaries is investigated. The emission is calculated from three-dimensional hydrodynamical models which incorporate gravity, the driving of the winds, orbital {{motion of the}} stars, and radiative cooling of the shocked plasma. Changes {{in the amount of}} stellar occultation and circumstellar attenuation introduce phase-dependent X-ray variability in systems with circular orbits, while strong variations in the intrinsic emission also occur in <b>systems</b> with <b>eccentric</b> orbits. The X-ray emission in <b>eccentric</b> <b>systems</b> can display strong hysteresis, with the emission softer after periastron than at corresponding orbital phases prior to periastron, reflecting the physical state of the shocked plasma at these times. Our simulated X-ray lightcurves bear many similarities to observed lightcurves. In systems with circular orbits the lightcurves show two minima per orbit, which are identical (although not symmetric) if the winds are identical. The maxima in the lightcurves are produced near quadrature, with a phase delay introduced due to th...|$|R
40|$|Two {{decades after}} the {{discovery}} of 51 Peg b, the formation processes and atmospheres of short-period gas giants remain poorly understood. Observations of <b>eccentric</b> <b>systems</b> provide key insights on those topics as they can illuminate how a planet's atmosphere responds to changes in incident flux. We report here the analysis of multi-day multi-channel photometry of the eccentric (e ~ 0. 93) hot Jupiter HD 80606 b obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The planet's extreme eccentricity combined with the long coverage and exquisite precision of new periastron-passage observations allow us to break the degeneracy between the radiative and dynamical timescales of HD 80606 b's atmosphere and constrain its global thermal response. Our analysis reveals that the atmospheric layers probed heat rapidly (~ 4 hr radiative timescale) from < 500 to 1400 K as they absorb ~ 20 % of the incoming stellar flux during the periastron passage, while the planet's rotation period is 93 _(- 35) ^(+ 85) hr, which exceeds the predicted pseudo-synchronous period (40 hr) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined n {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the population of eccentric binaries with a neutron star and a white dwarf that has been revealed in our galaxy in recent years through binary pulsar observations. We apply our statistical analysis method (Kim, Kalogera, & Lorimer 2003) and calculate the Galactic formation rate of these binaries empirically. We then compare our results with rate predictions based on binary population synthesis from various research groups and for various ranges of model input parameters. For our reference moel, we find the Galactic formation rate of these <b>eccentric</b> <b>systems</b> to be ~ 7 per Myr, about {{an order of magnitude}} smaller than results from binary evolution estimations. However, the empirical estimates are calculated with no correction for pulsar beaming, and therefore they should be taken as lower limits. Despite uncertainties that exceed an order of magnitude, there is significant overlap of the various rate calculations. This consistency lends confidence that our current understanding of the formation of these eccentric NS-WD binaries is reasonable...|$|R
40|$|Colliding wind {{binaries}} (CWBs) {{are unique}} laboratories for X-ray astrophysics. The massive stars in these systems possess powerful stellar winds with {{speeds up to}} ∼ 3000 km s^- 1, and their collision leads to hot plasma (up to ∼ 10 ^ 8 K) that emit thermal X-rays (up to ∼ 10 keV). Many X-ray telescopes have observed CWBs, including Suzaku, and our work aims to model these X-ray observations. We use 3 D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the wind-wind interaction, and then perform 3 D radiative transfer to compute the emergent X-ray flux, which is folded through X-ray telescopes' response functions to compare directly with observations. In these proceedings, we present our models of Suzaku observations of the multi-year-period, highly <b>eccentric</b> <b>systems</b> η Carinae and WR 140. The models reproduce the observations well away from periastron passage, but only η Carinae's X-ray spectrum is reproduced at periastron; the WR 140 model produces too much flux during this more complicated phase.

40|$|Compact binary coalescences are a {{promising}} source of gravitational waves for second-generation interferometric gravitational-wave detectors such as advanced LIGO and advanced Virgo. While most binaries {{are expected to}} possess circular orbits, some may be eccentric, for example, if they are formed through dynamical capture. Eccentric orbits can create difficulty for matched filtering searches due {{to the challenges of}} creating effective template banks to detect these signals. In previous work, we showed how seedless clustering can be used to detect low-mass (M_total≤ 10 M_) compact binary coalescences for both spinning and <b>eccentric</b> <b>systems,</b> assuming a circular post-Newtonian expansion. Here, we describe a parameterization that is designed to maximize sensitivity to low-eccentricity (0 ≤ϵ≤ 0. 6) systems, derived from the analytic equations. We show that this parameterization provides a robust and computationally efficient method for detecting eccentric low-mass compact binaries. Based on these results, we conclude that advanced detectors will have a chance of detecting eccentric binaries if optimistic models prove true. However, a null observation is unlikely to firmly rule out models of eccentric binary populations...|$|R
