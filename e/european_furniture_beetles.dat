30|$|A high {{relative}} abundance of plaster beetles {{is found in}} Annexe Tunnels (6.0 per trap) and at Casemate Tunnels (0.45 per trap), but are less frequent elsewhere (p[*]<[*] 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test). Plaster beetles feed on mould so as the Tunnels are damp, the environment may be suitable {{for the growth of}} this food source. As mentioned before the <b>furniture</b> <b>beetle</b> (Anobium punctatum) is frequent in Atcham Stores, especially at Atcham Store No. 31 (0.13 per trap) and the Tunnels of the Southeast Territory. Although found in five of the key London properties, the <b>furniture</b> <b>beetle</b> is not caught at high frequency in the capital.|$|R

40|$|AbstractDue to {{the current}} European {{economic}} stagnation and to face the increasing competition from emerging economies, {{significant changes in the}} <b>European</b> <b>furniture</b> industry need to be undertaken. Several institutions have produced reports showing that the <b>European</b> <b>furniture</b> industry must innovate the products, the production processes, the promotion strategies and the organizational structure in order to attain flexibility and productivity. The most relevant factor for the decrease in market share in the <b>European</b> <b>furniture</b> industry is the production cost, mainly due to labour and raw materials costs. The proposed information system aims to reduce the waste of raw materials generated in the production process, optimizing their purchase and consumption, boosting corporate profitability and sustainability...|$|R
5000|$|Anobiidae is {{a family}} of beetles. The larvae {{of a number of}} species tend to bore into wood, earning them the name [...] "woodworm" [...] or [...] "wood borer". A few species are pests, causing damage to wooden {{furniture}} and house structures, notably the deathwatch beetle, Xestobium rufovillosum, and the common <b>furniture</b> <b>beetle,</b> Anobium punctatum.|$|R

50|$|During {{restoration}} work, between 2000 and 2011, a Hammerbeam {{roof was}} discovered above a Georgian ceiling. The roof dated from 1446 to 1478. It had {{been damaged by}} Death watch beetle. The work received an award for the work from the Wood Awards in 2008. Wooden paneling had also been damaged by Death watch and Common <b>furniture</b> <b>beetle.</b> It was removed and restored.|$|R
50|$|Actual book-borers are uncommon. Two moths, {{the common}} clothes moth and the brown house moth, will attack cloth bindings. Leather-bound books attract various beetles, such as the larder beetle and the larva of the black carpet beetle and Stegobium paniceum.

50|$|The altarpiece was {{originally}} painted with distemper, but during a renovation in the 19th century all the paint was removed. Restoration works {{were carried out}} between 1852 and 1855 {{under the leadership of}} Adalbert Stifter, after it was discovered that common <b>furniture</b> <b>beetles</b> were damaging the wooden piece of art. During the renovation some parts of the altarpiece were replaced or altered by carpenters Johann Rint and Josef Rint. The renovation has been criticised, not least the removal of the paint. A second renovation was carried out in 1896, this time inspired by the explorer Andreas Reischek, who was born in Kefermarkt. Other restorative works have been made in 1904 and 1916 to 1918. In 1929, a new attempt to get rid of <b>furniture</b> <b>beetles</b> damaging the altarpiece was made using Zyklon B. In 1959 an attempt was made {{to get rid of the}} beetles for the last time, as the altarpiece then was cleaned and impregnated. The window panes of the choir were furthermore treated to make the light less damaging to the altarpiece.|$|R
5000|$|Powderpost beetles are a {{group of}} seventy species of woodboring beetles {{classified}} in the insect subfamily Lyctinae. These beetles, along with spider beetles, death watch <b>beetles,</b> common <b>furniture</b> <b>beetles,</b> skin beetles, and others, make up the superfamily Bostrichoidea. While most woodborers have a large prothorax, powderpost beetles do not, making their heads more visible. In addition to this, their antennae have two-jointed clubs. They are considered pests and attack deciduous trees, over time reducing the wood to a powdery dust. The damage caused by longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) is often confused with that of powderpost beetles, but the two groups are unrelated. Their larvae are white and C-shaped.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} 42 {{patients who}} had unusual pruritic dermatitis associated with a specifi c clinical sign (comet sign) in 23 houses in southeastern France from May through September 2007. Pyemotes ventricosus, a parasite of the <b>furniture</b> <b>beetle</b> Anobium punctatum, {{was the cause of}} this condition. In 2006, we described an outbreak of unusual dermatitis in southeastern France (1). Patients affected had highly erythematous pruritic macules typical of arthropod bites, sometimes associated with a linear erythematous macular tract that we called the comet sign (Figure 1). The cause of this outbreak remained unknown. In May 2007, during an entomologic ecoenvironmental investigation conducted inside the homes of some of these patients, we found wooden furniture, which harbored live <b>furniture</b> <b>beetles</b> (Anobium punctatum) (Figure 2, panel A), and small amounts of wood dust on the floor. Because A. punctatum does not bite humans or cause contact dermatitis (2), it was not considered as the direct causative agent. However, stereomicroscope examination of the wood dust identified the mite Pyemotes ventricosus (Figure 2, panel B). Because Pyemotes spp. can cause dermatitis (3), they were considered as the hypothetical agent causing the eruption. We then conducted an observational and entomologic study of the new cases...|$|R
30|$|The catch {{rate for}} some {{individual}} species {{is shown in}} Figures  3 c- 3 h, and here we see apparent differences in the regional distribution of insects (p[*]<[*] 0.001 for each figure, Chi-squared test DoF[*]=[*] 4). London for example shows a high frequency of silverfish, woolly bear larvae and webbing clothes moths compared with other territories. A high frequency of <b>furniture</b> <b>beetles</b> is notable in the Southeast and West, but to some extent these are driven by its prevalence in the Annexe and Casemate Tunnels (in the Southeast) and Atcham stores (under closure) in the West. In general the beetle is only found at 1.7 % occupancy {{in relation to the}} number of traps throughout the record, although at just over 3 % the Southeast and the West (p[*]=[*] 0.02, Mann–Whitney U test), but in the Tunnels and Atcham stores it is at 5.1 % and 5.2 % respectively (significant difference between these sites and the Southeast and the West territories; p[*]=[*] 0.04, Mann–Whitney U test). The wood weevils (Pentarthrum and Euophryum), show similar patterns to the <b>furniture</b> <b>beetle,</b> with highest catch rates in the southeast (0.053) and the west (0.028). Plaster beetles (Lathridiidae), as discussed below, are frequent in the Southeast.|$|R

Wyburd's designs were often given Saxon or Scottish names. One was the Athelstan chair, of around 1899.|$|R

5|$|Various beetles in the Bostrichoidea {{superfamily}} {{attack the}} dry, seasoned wood used as structural timber in houses {{and to make}} furniture. In most cases, it is the larvae that do the damage; these are invisible from {{the outside of the}} timber, but are chewing away at the wood in the interior of the item. Examples of these are the powderpost beetles, which attack the sapwood of hardwoods, and the <b>furniture</b> <b>beetles,</b> which attacks softwoods, including plywood. The damage has already been done by the time the adult beetles bore their way out, leaving neat round holes behind them. The first that a householder knows about the beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off or a piece of structural timber caves in. Prevention is through chemical treatment of the timber prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacture.|$|R
