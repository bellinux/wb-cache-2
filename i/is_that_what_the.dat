60|$|I do {{not know}} what the German breeder's idea is; at present he retains his secret. George {{suggests}} he is aiming at a griffin. There is much to bear out this theory, and indeed in one or two cases I have come across success on these lines would seem to have been almost achieved. Yet I cannot bring myself to believe that such are anything more than mere accidents. The German is practical, and I fail to see the object of a griffin.

60|$|Some say Maui {{noticed that}} the sun and moon rose again from their daily death, by virtue of a {{fountain}} in Hades (Hine-nui-te-po) where they bathed. Others say he wished to kill Hine-nui-te-po (conceived of as a woman) and to carry off her heart. Whatever the reason, Maui was to be swallowed up in the giant frame of Hades, or Night, and, if he escaped alive, Death would never have power over men. He made the desperate adventure, and would have succeeded but for the folly {{of one of the}} birds which accompanied him. This little bird, which sings at sunset, burst out laughing inopportunely, wakened Hine-nui-te-po, and she crushed to death Maui and all hopes of earthly immortality. Had he only come forth alive, men would have been deathless. Now, except that the bird which laughed sings at sunset, what is there 'solar' in all this? The sun does daily what Maui failed to do, {190a} passes through darkness and death back into light and life. Not only does the sun daily succeed where Maui failed, but it was his observation of this fact which encouraged Maui to risk the adventure. If Maui were the sun, we should all be immortal, for Maui's ordeal is daily achieved by the sun. But Dr. Tylor says: {190b} 'It is seldom that solar characteristics are more distinctly marked in the several details of a myth than they are here.' To us the characteristics seem to be precisely the reverse of solar. Throughout the cycle of Maui he is constantly set in direct opposition to the sun, and the very point of the final legend <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> sun could do Maui could not. Literally the one common point between Maui and the sun is that the little bird, the tiwakawaka, which sings at the daily death of day, sang at the eternal death of Maui.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{consider}} the very practical phenomenon of how actors build a stage voice and prepare for accent and dialect work, within the professional demands of the industry that present in Higher Education. How many times will a director say: "I don't want this rehearsal {{to be about the}} accent"? However the reality <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> director really means is that s/he does not want the actors worried about getting the accent right. One of the arguments we make in this paper is that until the actor engages with the technical demands of the form, they cannot fully access the meaning of the text. Actors must engage from within, with what Cicely Berry calls the ‘muscularity of the word’ so all the technical and physical demands of its delivery release the comprehension. In order to do this however, they need to release a deeper imaginative process of voice work that often falls into tension with notions of their own identity. The praxis element of this paper will consider how a wide range of disciplines can complement actor voice-training by unlocking an individual voice in order for the actor to imagine finding the voice of the poet. Aspects of music and postcolonial theory will be considered here, with the importance of imaginative play in the discovery of canonical poetry as a sonic ‘sign taken for a wonder’ (to paraphrase Homi Bhabha) ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{objective}} of the research {{is to examine the}} experience in professional practice of social workers and in particular to explore their informal learning at work. Definition of learning - From this point of view, informal learning is every individual practice or activity that is able to produce continuous learning. The tool used for the data collection was the narrative interview. The analysis of the contents and the narrative structure was facilitated by the scientific software ATLAS. ti. Design/Methodology/approach- This study used a qualitative research method, according to specific epistemologies as the Grounded Theory, and the inquiry into Narrative. The tool used for the data collection has been the narrative interview. The analysis of the contents and the narrative structure has been facilitated by the scientific software ATLAS. ti. Results - The data classified throughout the analysis allow to observe and explain possible interpretations of the informal learning of the social workers. Research limitation - The analysis of the data has been carried out through individual interviews and a series of interviews. A serious limitation of this procedure <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> actors say they have done or learned does not necessarily correspond to their actual learning: there are in fact actions, experiences, conditions that may result in learning that the actor is unaware of. Conclusions – The research offers some useful suggestions about the methodological contribution for the retrieval and the analysis of narrative data, the elaboration of a network among all the elements analyzed in each interview, defining some characteristics and contents of informal learning in the workplace...|$|E

40|$|Background: Following {{peripheral}} nerve lesion, the adult somatosensory system showedcortical reorganizational abilities. Previous studies identified the digits' somatotopy map changes and somatosensory cortical plasticity {{in response to}} the Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) that affected the dominant hand only. Objective: Answering the remained question <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> extent of the cortical plasticity would be in left and right somatosensory cortices in response to CTS affecting the right and left hands simultaneously. Methods: Cortical representations activated by tactile stimulation of median nerve (index) and ulnar nerve (little) of both dominant and non-dominant hands were evaluated by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) systemfor healthy participants and patient with bilateral moderate CTS. index – little fingers'somatotopy map and inter-digit cortical distance was then mapped and calculated for each participant on the real MRI data and the 3 D brain surface image. Results: in healthy participants, index – little inter-digit somatosensory cortical distance of right hand (dominant) was significantly larger than the index – little inter-digitsomatosensory cortical distance of left hand (11. 2 ± 2. 1 mm vs. 7. 0 ± 2. 9 mm, P = 0. 006). However, in patient with bilateral CTS, the index – little inter-digit somatosensory cortical distance of righthand (dominant) was significantly smaller than the index – little inter-digit somatosensory cortical distance of left hand (5. 8 mm vs. 7. 4 mm). Conclusion: our data could be interpreted as the hand use – dependency served more median nerve – cortical territory from the ulnar nerve invasion in the right somatotopy map (left hand) than the left somatotopy map of the right hand...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Following Ryanair’s {{announcement}} of intention {{to focus more}} on their service quality in September 2013, the researcher wants to explore if this change had an effect on the perceptions of price and service quality by UK and Italian consumers and link the results to customer experience, customer satisfaction and behavioural intentions when flying with the Irish airline. Design/Methodology – Six UK and six Italian semi-structured interviews were conducted as a data collection method for this exploratory study. One candidate per country was chosen for the following age groups: 18 - 24, 25 - 34, 35 - 44, 45 - 54 and 55 - 64 for a total of 12 interviews. The age groups categories were made based on standard age groups set by Quinlan (2011); Gray (2009); Sekaran and Bougie (2012); Jankowicz (2000) and Zikmund et al. (2013). Findings – The clear implication for Ryanair which emerged from this study <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> airline has done with their service is not enough to retain customers and that it still needs to rely heavily on price to influence customer experience, customer satisfaction and behavioural intentions. Ryanair needs to address issues such as their hand luggage policy, seat comfort and lack of empathy which customers still find frustrating when flying with them and makes them switch to a competitor if the price is similar. Limitation - The biggest limitation {{of this study is that}} the results are based on the themes that arose from interviewing six Ryanair consumers from Britain and six from Italy who were aged 19 - 60. To increase its validity the next step would be to conduct a quantitative research on a larger sample to verify the insights which emerged from this exploratory study...|$|E
40|$|In South Africa, {{questions}} {{of space and}} censorship are inseparable. It is impossible to discuss one without discussing the other. The apartheid censors set themselves up as "guardians of the literary", purporting to create a protected space where a particularly South African literature could flourish. In this thesis, my argument is {{that to be a}} "guardian of the literary" meant to be a guardian of space in literature, the way it was represented and the way characters moved through it. In order explore this argument I have focused on the censors' response to one writer in particular, Nadine Gordimer. My argument will show that in Gordimer, some spaces seem to be more acceptable than others, as evidenced by the censors' response to her work. Six of her novels were submitted for scrutiny by the Censorship Board. Three were banned, and three were passed. In The Literature Police: Apartheid Censorship and its Cultural Consequences, Peter McDonald asks "If all her novels [...] . engaged with the historical circumstances of apartheid South Africa in especially powerful and critical ways, then why were they not all deemed equally threatening to the established order?" My argument is that while it is difficult to provide a definitive answer, it is possible {{to make sense of the}} censors' decisions regarding her work by undertaking an analysis of the novels' literary geography. Focusing on the prevalence of certain spaces and the absence of others, and the way that characters move through these spaces, it is clear that they represent differing degrees of threat to the established order. In the censors' reports on Gordimer's work, crossing a physical boundary was the equivalent of crossing a moral boundary. Both the apartheid planners and the censors were fixated on boundaries and borders, on the importance of keeping some people in and more people out. My argument <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> architects of apartheid tried to do in reality, the censors tried to do in fiction. Their attempt to police the borders of the imaginary meant that some spaces were more acceptable than others, that some stories were told while others were ignored. In my final chapter, I argue that the effects of this can still be seen in contemporary novels written about South Africa. The censors had such a powerful hand in "deforming" literature that their fingerprints can still be detected today. A close analysis of certain elements of Patrick Flanery's Absolution (2012) will show that the structure and form of the novel corresponds in interesting ways with the apartheid censors' ideas of what literature should do and be...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MComm (Business Management)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. Any brand has a {{specific}} identity {{that the company}} wants to portray to consumers in its target market – its brand identity – what the brand stands for. This {{is also the case}} for Oakley, a luxury brand competing in the sports and fashion industries. In essence the brand identity of a company <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> brand is characterised by and what it stands for in the minds of consumers. By communicating its brand identity to consumers, a company create associations with the brand, which in turn forms the brand image that consumers have of the brand. The greater the degree to which consumers associate the brand with those characteristics that the brand in effect stands for, the greater the congruence between brand image and brand identity. The aim for a company is to realise a brand image in the minds of consumers that is similar, if {{not the same as the}} brand identity that it has identified for itself. In this study, the brand identity of Oakley is identified and the brand image that consumers have of the brand examined. The two concepts are then compared to find out to what degree the two are related and whether Oakley has in fact managed to portray their brand identity accurately (as reflected through the brand image). The relationship between price and quality for a brand represents the degree to which consumers believe the brand to be worth the money paid for it. It is widely believed that a brand with a high price is also of high quality and vice versa. This is not necessarily exclusively the case. The concept of quality and value differ from one individual to another, since it is based on the subjective perception of each individual. As mentioned earlier, associations form part of the brand image that consumers have of a brand. One of these associations might be their perception of quality of the brand, given the price of the brand. A luxury brand can charge a premium price, on the basis of various characteristics, one of which is the fact that the brand is perceived to be of high quality. Oakley is a luxury brand and charges a premium price. The study examines the quality and price of the brand by looking at the perceptions that consumers have of the brand with reference to the price/quality relationship, which represents one of the associations that contribute towards the formation of consumers’ brand image...|$|E
40|$|In November 2005, {{as part of}} an omnibus statute {{amending}} 11 different acts, the British Columbia {{government made}} several significant changes to BC 2 ̆ 7 s Land Title Act. The government announced that the changes to the title registration system would 2 ̆ 7 ensure immediate legal certainty of land title for a person acting in good faith, who unknowingly acquired a fee simple interest in the property through a forged transfer, provided the individual did not participate in the fraud 2 ̆ 7. In an effort to assuage fears of those who had acquired interests in a system that, if it needed to be fixed, had been somewhat less than secure, the government 2 ̆ 7 s information bulletin assured the public that BC’s registration system was 2 ̆ 7 already highly regarded 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 considered world-class 2 ̆ 7. The changes then were to be understood as improvements to what was already a good title registration system. Whatever its quality, the title registration system laboured with uncertainty over its central organizing principle. Did title registration in BC operate on the basis of immediate or deferred indefeasibility? The difference between the two principles lies in the security they provide the person who in good faith acquires an interest in land based on a void document such as a forged transfer instrument. Put simply, under immediate indefeasibility the registered owner of a fee simple interest is immune to a challenge that the registered owner acquired the interest {{on the basis of a}} void instrument. Under a deferred system the registered owner of a fee simple interest only holds indefeasible title if he or she is one step away from the fraudulent activity. A person who acquires an interest on the basis of a void instrument remains vulnerable to the claim of the person who has wrongfully deprived of his or her interest. The language in the government’s information bulletin – 2 ̆ 7 immediate legal certainty 2 ̆ 7 – suggests it intended to establish that BC’s title registration system rests on a foundation of immediate indefeasibility. If that were the intent, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> November 2005 amendments have done? Is it now unequivocally clear that BC operates on the basis of immediate indefeasibility? And if so, are property interests more secure as a result? This article reviews the previous sources of uncertainty in the Land Title Act, outlines the changes to it, and suggests their effect on those whose property interests are affected by fraudulent activity. It begins with a brief description of the manner in which the common law treated forged instruments purporting to transfer an interest in land and then outlines the nature of, and different approaches to, indefeasible title in title registration systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{study is to}} find out how a {{preschool}} teacher look upon children's culture and learning. have preschool teachers' understanding and work with children's culture been impacted by this initiative? To highlight this I have asked the following questions: How are preschool teachers' attitude towards Kultur i ögonhöjd? And where do learning fit in into preschools active undertaking with culture? I use qualitative interviews with a low degree of structure as a method to collect empirical data. The survey was conducted with a group of six preschool teachers where everyone works as culture delegates, a roll where they are ultimately responsible for preschools development in its undertaking of culture. I analyse the results with the help of Vygotsky and his theory of the proximal development zone. The proximal development zone is the potential for learning that go beyond what a child can reach on its own and to which a child can reach by help of others or artefacts. In this essay I divide children's culture into three categories. Culture for children is created by adults for children. Culture by children are when children themselves create without adult influence and culture with children when children and adults interact in the cultural process. Some of preschool teachers were positive about the venture presented by the city of Stockholm since it meant more opportunities for cultural experiences for children. They only showed prof of actively working with culture for children. A major part of the preschool teachers were disappointed in Stockholm's initiative as they considered that it only focused on culture for children. They felt that the culture by children and culture with children was pushed aside. When it comes to culture and learning processes, there are four main tracks. The adult conveys learning by making use of a cultural product, this is culture for children where the children reproduces what the adults presents them with. The next track is when adults tries to inspire by the means of culture for children, so that the children themselves become creators of culture by children. Now the idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> adult presents will lead the children to become creative. The third track is when the adults captures what the children are exploring and gives the children challenges, artefacts and discusses with the children so that they canmove forward in their processes. This is a form of culture with children. The last way is to create environments that are built for the children to explore and be creative in. The adult will be documenting the children´s behaviour so that they later can reflect over how they can challenge the children to help them forward in their learning process. This is a form of culture with children...|$|E
