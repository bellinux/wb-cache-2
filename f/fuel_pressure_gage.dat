40|$|The {{composite}} SARAS wing is a wet {{fuel tank}} enclosed by end ribs at station # 4, # 6 and # 20, rear spar, front spar, front beam, top skin and bottom skin. The <b>fuel</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{developed in the}} tank area due to the aircraft acceleration. The objective {{of this study is}} to check the safety of wing against combined effect of the critical air load and <b>fuel</b> <b>pressure</b> on the wing structure acting simultaneously. Static and buckling analysis of the wing for the combined critical air load case and <b>fuel</b> <b>pressure</b> case for ultimate load have been carried out to check the safety of the structure. Detailed studies have been made to understand the effect of <b>fuel</b> <b>pressure</b> at the skin to rib and skin to spar joints using the results of global FE analysis. The bolts pull through load on top flange and T-pull load on bottom flange of all ribs and spars have been extracted based on the analysis. This is to ensure the safety of bolted joints on top side against bolt pull load and co-cured joints on bottom side against T-pull load. The strains are extracted for stringers, rib and spar gussets which have been modeled using one dimensional element to prove the safety against <b>fuel</b> <b>pressure.</b> Filler cap cut out has been modeled with actual edge distances and rivet forces are extracted for comparing with test results on a single lap bearing specimen...|$|R
