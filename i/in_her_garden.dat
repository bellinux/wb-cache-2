5|$|Naomi Canning is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Morgana O'Reilly. Naomi was introduced as {{the daughter of}} established character Sheila Canning (Colette Mann), after producers decided they wanted to explore her background further. O'Reilly filmed her first audition <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>garden</b> in Sydney, before flying to Melbourne to audition in the studio. She competed with five other actresses for the part, but she believed that she was meant to get the role as Naomi is her middle name. A week after the second audition, O'Reilly's agent informed her that she had won the role. O'Reilly then relocated to Melbourne and began filming her first scenes in November 2013. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 25 March 2014. The character departed on 2 October 2015, following O'Reilly's decision to pursue new acting roles.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1980s, Cameron was {{focusing}} to {{a greater}} extent on her family life, particularly in looking after her grandchildren, who were known to go joyriding in her jeep. Neighbors recall her playing a Celtic harp <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>garden</b> and slowly walking her dog around the block while smoking a joint of marijuana. At one point, she was arrested for cultivating cannabis in her home. Cameron became a regular practitioner of Tai chi, took part in group sessions in Bronson Park under the tutelage of Marshall Ho'o, and earned a teaching certificate in the subject. She became very interested in José Argüelles' The Mayan Factor and Charles Musès' The Lion Path, and undertook the Neo-shamanic practices endorsed in the latter. She was also influenced by claims made in the writings of archaeologist Marija Gimbutas about a prehistoric matriarchal society devoted to a goddess. Cameron was very interested in A. S. Raleigh's Woman and Superwoman, taped her own reading of it, and sent copies to her friends and local public radio for broadcast. Throughout all of these disparate spiritual interests, she retained faith in the Thelemic ideas of Crowley.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the Allied withdrawal, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of their dead had to be left on the battlefield. Here they were buried in simple field graves (some little more than their own slit trenches) or in small mass graves dug by the Germans. Kate Ter Horst, whose house was used as a first aid post during the battle, found the graves of 57 men <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>garden</b> when she returned after the war. After Arnhem was liberated in April 1945, Grave Registration Units of the British 2nd Army moved into the area and began to locate the Allied dead. A small field north of Oosterbeek was offered on perpetual loan by the Netherlands government to the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission) in June 1945 and the dead were reburied there. Many of those killed during Arnhem's liberation were also buried at the same site. The cemetery was completed in February 1946, originally with the graves marked by metal crosses, although these were replaced by headstones in 1952. Most of the German dead were buried in the SS Heroes Cemetery near Arnhem after the battle, but reburied in Ysselsteyn German war cemetery after the war.|$|E

25|$|Only 20 {{minutes after}} escaping, Straffen came up a private drive in Crowthorne and {{approached}} Mrs. Doris Spencer, who was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>garden.</b> He {{asked her for}} a drink of water, which she gave him and then discussed the proximity of Broadmoor {{and the likelihood of}} escapes.

25|$|Colonists' {{hopes of}} peace rose {{over the summer}} of 1830-31 as Aboriginal attacks fell to a low level and the Colonial Times {{newspaper}} speculated that their enemy had either been wiped out or frightened into inaction. But the north remained a dangerous place: on 29 January a Dairy Plains woman was murdered—three months after her husband {{had died in a}} similar attack—and in March a mother carrying her infant was fatally speared while working <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>garden</b> on the East Tamar. Though the number of attacks in 1831 was {{less than a third of}} those the previous year—a total of 70, compared with 250 in 1830—settlers remained so fearful that many men refused to go out to work.|$|E
25|$|In late 1951, after Fo {{had gained}} {{experience}} with Parenti, Italian national radio station RAI invited Fo {{to perform a}} solo Saturday evening comedy series Poer nano (Poor dwarf), airing after Parenti's Anacleto the Gas Man. Fo created 18 adult fairy tale monologues adapted from biblical and historical tales. The series also featured Shakespearean tales with various twists, such as a version of Hamlet in which the titular character kills his father to continue an affair with his mother; Ophelia is portrayed as Hamlet's uncle's transvestite mistress, while Horatio plays the ghost of Hamlet's father dressed up as a sheet and only appears when Hamlet is drunk. The series also featured an albino Othello and a sadistic Juliet who keeps Romeo <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>garden</b> with savage dogs. Scandalised authorities cancelled the show. Nevertheless, Fo performed it on stage at the Teatro Odeon in Milan in 1952, which allowed him to develop the gesture and action not required for radio. Also in 1952, Fo performed Cocoricò with Giustino Durano, which featured a 20-minute sketch focusing on the plight of black people in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Hera– Zeus' jaded {{wife and}} former Queen of the Gods. In Betrayal, Hera's giant pet Argos {{was sent by}} the Gods to stop Kratos' rampage across Greece.

5000|$|The name [...] "Vatican" [...] {{was already}} in use {{in the time of}} the Roman Republic for a marshy area on {{the west bank of the}} Tiber across from the city of Rome. Under the Roman Empire, many villas were {{constructed}} there, after Agrippina the Elder (14 BC - 18 October AD 33) drained the area and laid out <b>her</b> <b>gardens</b> <b>in</b> the early 1st century AD. <b>In</b> AD 40, <b>her</b> son, Emperor Caligula (31 August AD 12-24 January AD 41; r. 37-41) built <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>gardens</b> a circus for charioteers (AD 40) that was later completed by Nero, the Circus Gaii et Neronis, usually called, simply, the Circus of Nero.|$|R

[...] In 1889, lawyer and civic leader Frederick Van Voorhies Holman helped found the Portland Rose Society. The rose cultivar Mme.

The cultivar gained popularity, and by 1905 Portland had [...] of rose-bordered streets, with about half-a-million rose bushes planted, attracting visitors to the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition.|$|E
500|$|Barney did {{not take}} her poetry as seriously as Vivien did, saying, [...] "if I had one {{ambition}} it was to make my life itself into a poem." [...] Her plays were only performed through amateur productions <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>garden.</b> According to Karla Jay, most of them lacked coherent plots and [...] "would probably baffle even the most sympathetic audience." [...] After 1910 she mostly wrote the epigrams and memoirs for which she is better known. Her last book of poetry was called Poems & Poemes: Autres Alliances and came out in 1920, bringing together romantic poetry in both French and English. Barney asked Ezra Pound to edit the poems but then ignored the detailed recommendations he made.|$|E
500|$|Frederick the Great was {{published}} later in 1970 to a muted reception. Mitford's remaining years {{were dominated by}} her illness, although for a time she enjoyed visits from her sisters and friends, and working <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>garden.</b> In April 1972 the French government made her a Chevalier of the Légion d'Honneur, and later that year the British government appointed her a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). She was delighted by the former honour, and amused by the latter—which she remembered Waugh had called an [...] "insult" [...] and turned down. At the end of 1972 she entered the Nuffield Clinic in London, where {{she was diagnosed with}} Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the blood. She lived for another six months, unable to look after herself and in almost constant pain, struggling to keep her spirits up. She wrote to her friend James Lees-Milne: [...] "It's very curious, dying, and would have many a drôle amusing & charming side {{were it not for the}} pain". She died on 30 June 1973 at her home in the rue d'Artois and was cremated in Versailles, after which her ashes were taken to Swinbrook for burial alongside her sister Unity.|$|E
60|$|Lady Casterley {{was that}} {{inconvenient}} thing--an early riser. No {{woman in the}} kingdom was a better judge of a dew carpet. Nature had <b>in</b> <b>her</b> time displayed before her thousands of those pretty fabrics, where all {{the stars of the}} past night, dropped to the dark earth, were waiting to glide up to heaven again on the rays of the sun. At Ravensham she walked regularly <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>gardens</b> between half-past seven and eight, and when she paid a visit, was careful to subordinate whatever might be the local custom to this habit.|$|R

In India, Donald enters the palace of the Maharajah, where she challenges him to defeat the tiger <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>garden</b> {{in exchange for a}} Sphinx Tear. Donald succeeds and receives the Sphinx Tear, which is the key to open a temple in Egypt. Donald is able to solve the [...] "Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] using the note Goofy had given him, and obtains the Scepter of Ra before escaping in a mine cart. From there, he journeys to the South Pole, where he finds a key frozen in ice, and uses the Scepter of Ra to melt the ice and grab the key. The key unlocks the hold of a Viking ship, which contains an ancient diary with the secret to locating the treasure. The ship is haunted by ghosts, and the Viking captain sends Donald below decks to get rid of them. After defeating a skeletal Viking warrior, Donald returns to the deck, where the captain informs him that the diary is hidden in ice near the South Pole, and gives him an [...] "ancient Viking plunger" [...] that attaches to flying creatures. Donald then returns to the South Pole, hitching a ride on one of Pete's bird minions to reach the diary.|$|E
500|$|Brooks {{is thought}} to have stopped {{painting}} by several writers, but she herself tells us that she drew all her life.

[...] She and Barney were involved in promoting her work and arranging gallery and museum placements for her paintings. [...] She became increasingly reclusive, and while Barney continued to visit her frequently, by the mid-1950s she had to stay in a hotel, meeting Brooks only for lunch. [...] Brooks spent weeks at a time in a darkened room, believing she was losing her eyesight. [...] She became paranoid, fearing that someone was stealing her drawings and that her chauffeur planned to poison her. In a 1965 letter she cautioned Barney not to lie down on the benches <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>garden,</b> lest the plants feed on her life force: [...] "Trees especially are our enemies and would suck us dry." [...] In the last year of her life, she stopped communicating with Barney entirely, leaving letters unanswered and refusing to open the door when Barney came to visit. [...] She died in Nice, France, in 1970 at the age of 96. Barney and Brooks are both buried at Passy Cemetery, Paris.|$|E
