5|$|A <b>fusible</b> plug is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a {{tapered hole}} drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the <b>fusible</b> plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E
5|$|A {{patented}} (Patent published 1867) type of fireproof safe uses a <b>fusible</b> plug to douse {{its contents}} with water if the external temperature gets too high.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{conceptions of}} metals as solid, <b>fusible</b> and {{malleable}} substances {{can be found}} in Plato's Timaeus (c. 360 BCE) and Aristotle's Meteorology.|$|E
5|$|Demand for bismuth {{was small}} prior to World War II and was {{pharmaceutical}} – bismuth compounds {{were used to}} treat such conditions as digestive disorders, sexually transmitted infections and burns. Minor amounts of bismuth metal were consumed in <b>fusible</b> alloys for fire sprinkler systems and fuse wire. During World War II bismuth was considered a strategic material, used for solders, <b>fusible</b> alloys, medications and atomic research. To stabilize the market, the producers set the price at $1.25 per pound (2.75 $/kg) {{during the war and}} at $2.25 per pound (4.96 $/kg) from 1950 until 1964.|$|E
5|$|Automobile air {{conditioning}} systems were commonly fitted with <b>fusible</b> plugs, operating at 100–110°C, but from concerns about the environmental effects of any released refrigerant gas this function has {{been taken over by}} an electrical switch.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fusible</b> plugs are {{sometimes}} fitted to the receivers of air compressors {{as a precaution}} against the ignition of any lubricating oil vapour that might be present. Should {{the action of the}} compressor heat the air above a safe temperature the core will melt and release the pressure.|$|E
5|$|A {{drawback}} to {{the device was}} found on 7 March 1948, when the firebox crown sheet of Princess Alexandra, a Coronation Pacific of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, failed while hauling a passenger train from Glasgow to London. Enquiries established that both water gauges were defective and on a journey earlier that day {{one or both of}} the <b>fusible</b> plugs had melted, but this had gone unnoticed by the engine crew because of the strong draught carrying the escaping steam away from them.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the easiest}} to recycle would be bismuth-containing <b>fusible</b> alloys {{in the form of}} larger objects, then larger {{soldered}} objects. Half of the world's solder consumption is in electronics (i.e., circuit boards). As the soldered objects get smaller or contain little solder or little bismuth, the recovery gets progressively more difficult and less economic, although solder with a higher silver content will be more worthwhile recovering. Next in recycling feasibility would be sizeable catalysts with a fair bismuth content, perhaps as bismuth phosphomolybdate, and then bismuth used in galvanizing and as a free-machining metallurgical additive.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} design {{was a simple}} solid plug filled with a slug of low-melting-point alloy. When this melts, it first melts as a narrow channel through the plug. Steam and water immediately begins to escape through this. The cored <b>fusible</b> plug {{was developed in the}} 1860s to give a wide opening as soon as the alloy softens. This version has a solid brass or bronze centre, soldered into place by a layer of the low-melting-point alloy. When overheated, the plug does not release any steam or water until the alloy melts sufficiently to release the centre plug. The plug now fails dramatically, opening its entire bore immediately. This full-bore jet is then more likely to be noticed.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is easily}} {{extracted}} from its ores; prehistoric people in Western Asia knew of it. Galena, a principal ore of lead, often bears silver, interest in which helped initiate widespread extraction {{and use of}} lead in ancient Rome. Lead production declined {{after the fall of}} Rome and did not reach comparable levels until the Industrial Revolution. In 2014, annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. Lead's high density, low melting point, ductility and relative inertness to oxidation make it useful. These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, batteries, bullets and shot, weights, solders, pewters, <b>fusible</b> alloys, white paints, leaded gasoline, and radiation shielding.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of the <b>fusible</b> core process is not limited just to the injection of thermoplastics, but with corresponding core alloys also to thermosetting plastic molding materials (duroplast). The <b>fusible</b> core process finds application, for example, for injection molded passenger car engine intake manifolds. By modifying the equipment, small molded parts like valves or pump housings can be manufactured, as the manufacture of the <b>fusible</b> cores and the injected parts {{can be carried out}} on an injection molding machine.|$|E
25|$|Cores {{are used}} for complex {{injection}} moldings in the <b>fusible</b> core injection molding process. First, a core is made from a <b>fusible</b> alloy or low melting temperature polymer. It is then placed inside the injection mold's dies and the plastic is shot into the mold. The molding is then removed from the mold with the core still in it. Finally, the core is melted or washed out of the molding in a hot bath.|$|E
25|$|Various <b>fusible</b> alloys {{can be used}} as solders {{with very}} low melting points; {{examples}} include Field's metal, Lipowitz's alloy, Wood's metal, and Rose's metal.|$|E
25|$|Large power fuses use <b>fusible</b> {{elements}} made of silver, copper or tin {{to provide}} stable and predictable performance. High voltage expulsion fuses surround the <b>fusible</b> link with gas-evolving substances, such as boric acid. When the fuse blows, {{heat from the}} arc causes the boric acid to evolve large volumes of gases. The associated high pressure (often greater than 100 atmospheres) and cooling gases rapidly quench the resulting arc. The hot gases are then explosively expelled out of the end(s) of the fuse. Such fuses can only be used outdoors.|$|E
25|$|Some {{manufacturers}} of medium-voltage distribution fuses combine the overcurrent protection {{characteristics of the}} <b>fusible</b> element with the flexibility of relay protection by adding a pyrotechnic device to the fuse operated by external protective relays.|$|E
25|$|Two new {{trademark}} filings for Desert Strike made in November 25, 2013 {{have been}} discovered on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's website by <b>Fusible</b> And Edited by Aura87. These list EA as the company filing for them but provide no additional information of substance or interest.|$|E
25|$|Breguet {{recommended}} {{the use of}} reduced-section conductors to protect telegraph stations from lightning strikes; by melting, the smaller wires would protect apparatus and wiring inside the building. A variety of wire or foil <b>fusible</b> elements were in use to protect telegraph cables and lighting installations as early as 1864.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Sina {{classified}} minerals into stones, <b>fusible</b> substances, sulfurs, and salts, {{building on}} the ideas of Aristotle and Jabir. The epistola de Re recta is somewhat less sceptical of alchemy; Anawati argues that it is by Avicenna, but written earlier in his career when {{he had not yet}} firmly decided that transmutation was impossible.|$|E
25|$|Only two {{elements}} are liquid at standard conditions for temperature and pressure: mercury and bromine. Four more elements have melting points slightly above room temperature: francium, caesium, gallium and rubidium. Metal alloys that are liquid {{at room temperature}} include NaK, a sodium-potassium metal alloy, galinstan, a <b>fusible</b> alloy liquid, and some amalgams (alloys involving mercury).|$|E
25|$|Selenizza {{is mainly}} {{used as an}} {{additive}} in the road construction sector. It is mixed with traditional asphalt to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing. It may be blended with the hot asphalt in tanks, but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants. Other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks, bridges, car-parks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for {{the oil and gas}} industry. Selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in sacks or in thermal <b>fusible</b> polyethylene bags.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 paper {{demonstrated}} that a dense plasma focus had achieved temperatures of 1.8 billion degrees Celsius, sufficient for boron fusion, and that fusion reactions were occurring primarily within the contained plasmoid, {{a necessary condition}} for net power. The focus consists of two coaxial cylindrical electrodes made from copper or beryllium and housed in a vacuum chamber containing a low-pressure <b>fusible</b> gas. An electrical pulse is applied across the electrodes, heating the gas into a plasma. The current forms into a minuscule vortex along the axis of the machine, which then kinks into a cage of current with an associated magnetic field. The cage of current and magnetic-field-entrapped plasma is called a plasmoid. The acceleration of the electrons about the magnetic field lines heats the nuclei within the plasmoid to fusion temperatures.|$|E
25|$|During operation, the boiler's {{water level}} is {{constantly}} monitored, normally via a transparent tube {{referred to as}} a sight glass, or with a gauge. Maintaining a proper water level is central to the efficient and safe operation of the boiler. If the water level is too high, steam production is decreased, efficiency is lost and in extreme cases, water will be carried out with the steam into the cylinders, possibly causing mechanical damage. More seriously, if the water level gets too low, the crown (top) and/or side sheets of the firebox may become exposed. Without sufficient water to absorb the heat of combustion, the firebox sheets may soften and melt, with the possible result of high-pressure steam being ejected with tremendous force through the firebox and into the locomotive's cab. The development of the <b>fusible</b> plug, a device to release pressure in conditions of excessively high temperature and low water levels was intended to protect against this occurrence.|$|E
500|$|The {{principle}} of the <b>fusible</b> plug is also applied to the transport of liquefied petroleum gases, where <b>fusible</b> plugs (or small, exposed patches of the containers' lining membrane) are designed to melt or become porous if too high a temperature is reached: a controlled release, at a typical temperature of 250 °F (120 °C), is preferable to an explosive release (a [...] "BLEVE") at a higher temperature. Corrosive gas containers, such as those used for liquid chlorine, are fitted {{with one or more}} <b>fusible</b> plugs with an operating temperature [...] of about 158 to 165°F (70–74°C).|$|E
500|$|<b>Fusible</b> plugs {{are common}} in {{aircraft}} wheels, typically in larger or high-performance aircraft. [...] The very large thermal loads imposed by abnormal landing and braking conditions (and RTO notably) can cause already high pressure in the tyres {{to rise to the}} point that the tyre might burst, so <b>fusible</b> plugs are used as a relief mechanism. [...] The vented gas may be directed to cool the braking surfaces.|$|E
500|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) – uses an {{automatically}} fed consumable electrode and {{a blanket of}} granular <b>fusible</b> flux. The molten weld and the arc zone are protected from atmospheric contamination by being [...] "submerged" [...] under the flux blanket.|$|E
500|$|Wrought iron {{contains}} {{less than}} 0.25% carbon but {{large amounts of}} slag that give it a fibrous characteristic. It is a tough, malleable product, but not as <b>fusible</b> as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron {{is characterized by the}} presence of fine fibers of slag entrapped within the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by mild steel for traditional [...] "wrought iron" [...] products and blacksmithing.|$|E
500|$|In the 1920s {{investigations}} by the [...] U.S. [...] Bureau of Standards, {{in conjunction}} with the Steamboat Inspection Service, found that in use encrustation and oxidation above the <b>fusible</b> core can increase melting point of the device and prevent it from working when needed: melting points in excess of 2000 °F (1100 °C) in used examples have been found. Typical current practice in locomotives requires new plugs to be inspected after [...] "15 to 30 working days (dependent upon water condition and use of locomotive) or at ...|$|E
500|$|A <b>fusible</b> plug {{operates}} as a safety valve when dangerous temperatures, rather than dangerous pressures, are reached in a closed vessel. In steam engines [...] the <b>fusible</b> plug is screwed into the crown sheet (the top plate) of the firebox, typically extending about an inch (25mm) into the water space above. Its purpose is {{to act as a}} last-resort safety device in the event of the water level falling dangerously low: when the top of the plug is out of the water it overheats, the low-melting-point core melts away and the resulting noisy release of steam into the firebox serves to warn the operators of the danger before the top of the firebox itself runs completely dry, which could result in catastrophic failure of the boiler. The temperature of the flue gases in a steam engine firebox can reach 1000°F (550°C), at which temperature copper, from which historically most fireboxes were made, softens to a state which can no longer sustain the boiler pressure and a severe explosion will result if water is not put into the boiler quickly and the fire removed or extinguished. The hole through the plug is too small to have any great effect in reducing the steam pressure and the small amount of water, if any, that passes through it is not expected to have any great impact in quenching the fire.|$|E
500|$|In 1924, indium {{was found}} to have a valued {{property}} of stabilizing non-ferrous metals, and that became the first significant use for the element. The first large-scale application for indium was coating bearings in high-performance aircraft engines during World War II, to protect against damage and corrosion; this is no longer a major use of the element. [...] New uses were found in <b>fusible</b> alloys, solders, and electronics. In the 1950s, tiny beads of indium were used for the emitters and collectors of PNP alloy-junction transistors. In the middle and late 1980s, the development of indium phosphide semiconductors and indium tin oxide thin films for liquid-crystal displays (LCD) aroused much interest. By 1992, the thin-film application had become the largest end use.|$|E
500|$|Experiments {{conducted}} by the Franklin Institute, Boston, in the 1830s had initially {{cast doubt on the}} practice of adding water as soon as the escape of steam through the device was noted. A steam boiler was fitted with a small observation window of glass and heated beyond its normal operating temperature with the water level below the top of the firebox. When water was added {{it was found that the}} pressure rose suddenly and the observation glass shattered. The report concluded that the high temperature of the metal had vaporised the added water too quickly and that an explosion was the inevitable result. It was not until 1852 that this assumption was challenged: Thomas Redmond, one of the Institute's own inspectors, [...] specifically ruled out this theory in his investigation into the [...] boiler explosion on the steam ship Redstone on the Ohio River on 3 April that year. A 1907 investigation in Wales came to a similar conclusion: a steam locomotive belonging to the Rhymney Railway was inadvertently sent out with its safety valves wrongly assembled. The pressure in the boiler built up to the extent that the injectors failed; the crown sheet became uncovered, was weakened by the heat of the fire and violently blew apart. The investigation, led by Colonel Druitt of the Railway Inspectorate, dismissed the theory that the enginemen had succeeded in starting the [...] injectors and that the sudden flood of cold water had caused such a generation of steam that the boiler burst. He quoted the results of experiments by the Manchester Steam Users' Association, a national boiler certification and insurance body, that proved that the weight of copper present (considered with its specific heat) was insufficient to generate enough steam to raise the boiler pressure at all. Indeed, the addition of cold water had caused the pressure to fall. From then on it was accepted that the correct action in the event of the operation of the <b>fusible</b> plug was to add water.|$|E
2500|$|Cardarelli, {{writing in}} 2008, categorizes zinc, cadmium, mercury, gallium, indium, thallium, tin, lead, {{antimony}} and bismuth as <b>fusible</b> metals. Nearly 100 years earlier, Louis (1911) noted that <b>fusible</b> metals were alloys containing tin, cadmium, lead, and bismuth in various proportions, [...] "the tin ranging from 10 to 20%." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Fusible</b> core {{injection}} molding, {{also known}} as lost core injection molding, is a specialized plastic injection molding process used to mold internal cavities or undercuts that are not possible to mold with [...] cores. Strictly speaking the term [...] "fusible core injection molding refers {{to the use of}} a <b>fusible</b> alloy as the core material; when the core material is made from a soluble plastic the process is known as soluble core injection molding. This process is often used for automotive parts, such as intake manifolds and brake housings, however it is also used for aerospace parts, plumbing parts, bicycle wheels, and footwear.|$|E
2500|$|In medium-voltage {{distribution}} systems, a {{power fuse}} {{may be used}} to protect a transformer serving 1–3 houses.
