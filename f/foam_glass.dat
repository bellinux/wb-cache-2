40|$|The {{greenhouse}} {{industry is}} facing significant challenges {{such as the}} demand for more efficient use of energy and natural resources and prevention of detrimental environmental impacts. Reducing negative environmental impacts {{can be achieved by}} utilizing recycled and environmentally friendly products and by optimizing the use of water and root zone substrates. New and advanced root zone substrates are currently tested as substitute for natural soils in greenhouse agriculture. They can be inert non-organic materials such as rockwool and perlite. These are mined products from the earth, and are difficult to dispose after use. Natural substrates such as peat are being consumed faster than being regenerated. A new potential substrate that consists of recycled <b>foamed</b> <b>glass</b> aggregates is considered an alternative, as it is environmentally friendly, non-toxic and disposable. Experiments with <b>foamed</b> <b>glass</b> aggregates and with <b>foamed</b> <b>glass</b> aggregate/coconut coir mixtures indicated that the yield of greenhouse tomatoes was not statistically significant different (Î±= 0. 05) when compared to rockwool. To investigate the potential application of recycled glass as a root zone substrate, physical and hydraulic properties were measured. For comparison, the same measurements were completed for rockwool, coconut coir, perlite, and PET/PE fibers as well as for a mixture of coconut coir and recycled glass. The water characteristics (WC) determined for each substrate exhibited distinct air entry potentials, which provided information for irrigation scheduling, water storage and aeration for optimum plant growth conditions. Coconut coir and rockwool exhibited a unimodal shaped water retention curve, while <b>foamed</b> <b>glass</b> aggregates and perlite exhibited bimodal shaped curves. The obtained substrate properties were used as input paramaters for HYDRUS- 2 D/ 3 D model to simulate water mass balance and matric potential distributions within a typical growth container of <b>foamed</b> <b>glass</b> aggregates.

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{proposes a}} method for the {{processing}} of mine refuse non-ferrous metal ore {{in the production of}} <b>foamed</b> <b>glass.</b> The subject of this research is a low-temperature frit synthesis (< 900 Â Â°C), allowing for the high-temperature glass melting process to be avoided. The technology for the production of frit without complete melting of the batch and without using glass-making units offers a considerable reduction in energy consumption and air pollution. It was found that material samples obtained with a density of up to 250 [*]kg/m 3 are of rigidity (up to 1. 7 [*]MPa) in comparison with the conventional <b>foamed</b> <b>glass</b> (1 [*]MPa). This increased rigidity was due to the presence of crystalline phase particles in its interpore partition of less than 2 [*]Âµm in size. Material with a density of 300 [*]kg/cm 3 is recommended for thermal insulation for the industrial and construction sectors. At densities above 300 [*]kg/cm 3 and a strength of 2. 5 [*]MPa, the purpose becomes heat-insulating construction material.

40|$|Lightweight fill materials, {{including}} foamed aggregates {{are increasingly}} being used in civil engineering and infrastructure applications. This research assessed the engineering properties of <b>foamed</b> recycled <b>glass</b> through a laboratory evaluation to ascertain this novel recycled material as a lightweight fill material in civil engineering applications. The engineering assessment included particle size distribution, particle density, water absorption, minimum and maximum dry densities with a vibrating table, California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and Los Angeles (LA) abrasion tests. Shear strength properties of the recycled <b>foamed</b> <b>glass</b> were studied through large-scale direct shear tests. This recycled <b>foamed</b> <b>glass</b> is classified as a gap graded material. Due to high porosity, the coarse particles of this material have high water absorption of 60 % and low particle density of 4. 54 kN/m 3, which is much {{lower than that of}} water. The minimum and maximum dry densities of this material are very low of 1. 67 and 2. 84 kN/m 3, respectively. The LA abrasion of <b>foamed</b> recycled <b>glass</b> is lower than the requirement for pavement base/subbase material, being of 94 %. The shear resistance at small shear displacement is thus low as shown by low CBR value of 9 - 12 %. However, the shear resistance at large shear displacement is high as shown by high cohesion and friction angle of 23. 36 kPa and 54. 7 o, respectively. The environmental assessment included pH value, organic content, total and leachate concentration of the material for a range of contaminant constituents. All the hazardous concentrations in the leachate are far lower than 100 times of those of the drinking water standards, indicting the <b>foamed</b> recycled <b>glass</b> as a non-hazardous material. The energy savings assessment demonstrates that the use of <b>foamed</b> recycled <b>glass</b> as engineering material has much lower energy consumption relative to a conventional aggregate-cement material in construction projects. The lightweight properties of the <b>foamed</b> recycled <b>glass</b> coupled with its satisfactory engineering and environmental results, particularly its high friction angle, indicates that the material is ideal for usage as a lightweight construction material in engineering applications such as non-structural fills in embankments, retaining wall backfill and pipe bedding...|$|R

30|$|It {{also could}} be seen that <b>foam</b> <b>glass</b> blocks in both {{the first and second}} group {{experienced}} no significant change in weight as well as appearance. This indicated the immersion in acid condensation or the exposure to cyclic wet-dry conditions had no significant effect on <b>foam</b> <b>glass</b> blocks. The minimal corrosion rates were 0.0580 and 0.0583 Â mm/y, denoting that <b>foam</b> <b>glass</b> blocks were very stable and were not selective to the outer environments. The excellent corrosion resistance could be explained by the protective silicon dioxide (SiO 2) and boron trioxide (B 2 O 3) layer formed above the surface during the experimental process (Soo Park et al. 1999). Obviously, simultaneous accumulation of SiO 2 and B 2 O 3 led to comparatively less loss of <b>foam</b> <b>glass</b> blocks on the glass surface.|$|E

The laboratory tests included moisture characteristics, rehydration rate and pH buffering analyses. Cucumbers and later on tomatoes were propagated in rockwool propagation cubes and planted on slabs of Growstonesâ¢ <b>glass</b> <b>foam</b> granulate. They were compared with cucumber respectively tomatoes grown on rockwool slabs. Lab results show that the coarse nature of the <b>glass</b> <b>foam</b> granulate (0. 5 - 5 cm) limits the maximum moisture content to 50 %. The rehydration rate is very high, reaching more than 80 % of container capacity in 5 min. The tested material initially reacts with water, raising the pH to over 10 pH units. Based on lab results a recipe for rinsing the material prior to cultivation was calculated. Cucumber cultivation results show an equal production to plants grown on rockwool. The first yield on <b>glass</b> <b>foam</b> granulate is 1 - 2 days earlier. The susceptibility to Pythium is significantly lower than on rockwool. The wax layer on cucumbers grown on <b>glass</b> <b>foam</b> granulate is perceptibly thicker as consequence of an elevated silicon level of 0. 25 to 1. 6 mmol L- 1 in the slab solution. Tomatoes on <b>glass</b> <b>foam</b> granulate show smaller stem diameters and recovered faster from blossom end rot. Yield levels on <b>glass</b> <b>foam</b> granulate and rockwool are equal.

40|$|The {{physical}} properties and microstructure {{of a new}} kind of borosilicate foam glasses with different Sb 2 O 3 doping content are comprehensively investigated. The experimental results show that appropriate addition of Sb 2 O 3 has positive impact on the bulk porosity and compressive strength of the <b>foam</b> <b>glass.</b> It is more suitable in this work to introduce 0. 9 [*]wt. % Sb 2 O 3 into the Na 2 O-K 2 O-B 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 basic <b>foam</b> <b>glass</b> component and sinter at 775 Â°C. And the obtained foam glasses present much more uniform microstructure, large pore size, and smooth cell walls, which bring them with better performance including a lower bulk density, low water absorption, and an appreciable compressive strength. The microstructure analysis indicates that, with the increase of the content of Sb 2 O 3 additives, the cell size tends to increase at first and then decreases. Larger amounts of Sb 2 O 3 do not change the crystalline phase of <b>foam</b> <b>glass</b> but increase its vitrification.
