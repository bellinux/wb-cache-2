25|$|In Pakistan {{the central}} bank's foreign {{currency}} reserves, when counting <b>forward</b> <b>liabilities</b> {{is said to}} only amount to as little as $3 billion, sufficient for a single month of imports. Corruption and mismanagement have combined with high oil prices to damage Pakistan's economy. Pakistan's rupee has lost more than 21 per cent of its value in 2008 and inflation is at 25 per cent. The government has failed to defer payments for Saudi oil or raise favorable loans. President Asif Ali Zardari claimed Pakistan needed a bailout worth $100 billion which {{he was expected to}} ask for at a meeting in Abu Dhabi in November. Ratings agency Standard and Poor's rates Pakistan's sovereign debt at CCC +, only a few ratings above the default level, warning the country may be unable to cover about $3 billion in upcoming debt payments.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for hedging option portfolios and custom-tailored derivative securities which uses options to manage volatility risk.

This equation gives sub-additive portfolio prices and hence provides a natural ordering of preferences in terms of hedging with options.

40|$|In 2011 the NZ {{government}} {{adopted from}} the Accident Compensation Corporation via the Welfare Working Group a programme of actuarially estimating {{the cost of}} someone staying long-term on a benefit and using that {{as the basis for}} defining the return from "investing" in action that deflected that person from a benefit into long-term work. The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) engaged an Australian firm, Taylor Fry, to do the actuarial estimates of long-term benefit costs. It applied programmes incorporating those estimates initially to 16 - 17 -year-olds and sole teen mothers of 16 - 18 in the welfare system, groups known to have a high risk of long-term benefit-dependency. This actuarial/investment technique is known as the "forward-liability investment approach" or just the "investment approach". Including the "forward-liability" qualifier underlines that in its initial application the technique is essentially insurance against a future liability. Leaving out the "forward liability" qualifier suggests an investment approach might logically be applied to building assets in addition to avoiding liabilities and applied more widely in policy development and government decision-making. The idea of "investment" as an element in government services was not new. Education has long been assumed to be an investment: individuals get a return in higher wages through investing in higher skills; society as a whole gets a return in higher productivity and greater prosperity and, some would add, a more cohesive society from the greater potential for full civic and social engagement education can enable and encourage. More recently, there has been some debate about the level of return on educational investment and the division of returns between individuals and society as a whole. In 1997 a paper by two Department of Social Welfare analysts argued for investment against future costs, that is, against a contingent future liability. But it did so in fiscal, not economic, terms. In that sense it anticipated the <b>forward</b> <b>liability</b> investment approach. Peter Hughes, MSD chief executive from 2001, argued unsuccessfully for investment concepts to be adopted. The Minister of Finance, Bill English, has said on several occasions that he wants to apply investment thinking to some (unspecified) other social services. He has more recently boiled this down to the phrase "social investment" and talked specifically about at-risk children under 5. In the 2015 budget he acknowledged that income was a contributing factor to "child hardship" and introduced an up-to- $ 25 -a-week increase in the benefit and income-related additions to Working For Families income tax rebates. But is <b>forward</b> <b>liability</b> the most useful and appropriate measure...|$|R
40|$|In November 2012, Gabriel Makhlouf, the {{secretary}} to the Treasury, gave a wide-ranging {{speech to the}} Trans-Tasman Business Circle which discussed, among other things, recent reforms in the welfare system. He described the new ‘investment approach’ as a significant change to the New Zealand welfare system, which he suggested would effectively get people back into work, reduce poverty and increase living standards. The overarching welfare reforms announced and being implemented by the current government are in large part constructed around this investment approach, which provides a central policy narrative to the reforms. The centrality of the investment approach is expressed via the operational use of a measure of what is variously termed ‘forward liability’, ‘future liability’ or ‘long-term liability’ of the welfare system as the key performance management tool for Work and Income. <b>Forward</b> <b>liability</b> (the term exclusively used here) is basically the total current and future fiscal costs of welfare, appropriately discounted. Makhlouf is correct in his assessment that the investment approach marks a significant departure in terms of performance management for the New Zealand welfare system. The {{purpose of this article}} is to critically examine the new model and its likely effectiveness, with a view to better understanding its strengths and its weaknesses. The perspective taken is one of mainstream public economics and labour economics...|$|R
40|$|Though {{the forward}} foreign {{exchange}} market whether {{in terms of the}} outright transaction or foreign exchange swap can be potentially useful as an official policy tool, there are also pitfalls in its uses. The Thai Central Bank, during the 1996 - 1997 currency crisis, utilized intensively the forward market as a tool for the domestic monetary policy and for counter–speculation against the fixed baht value. After the initial defense of the baht in the spot market, the Bank of Thailand usually followed it up with a buy-sell swap. The sterilized foreign exchange intervention resulted in a substantial <b>forward</b> <b>liability</b> for the Bank of Thailand. The speculation was enticed into operating in the forward market due to an ample supply from the official source. The forward intervention could prevent the immediate loss of international reserves without causing much impact on domestic interests rates to rise. But speculators expected large gains when the forward rate was relatively subdued or implicitly and unintentionally subsidized by the large official intervention. Thus, substantial forward intervention was very risky when it helped to prolong the expected unsustainability of the pegged value of the baht in the midst of rapidly deteriorating external sector, the accumulation of huge short–term external debt and domestic financial institution problems. Estimates of the financial loss in the forward intervention to the Bank of Thailand after the Baht floated in July 1997 amounted to US $ 8. 44 billion. There was an additional estimated loss in the spot market intervention of US $ 6. 71 billion. Injudicious and unlimited use of the forward exchange intervention was a crucial factor contributing to serious economic ramifications that followed {{after the fall of the}} baht. 1...|$|R
50|$|Five {{months after}} Haratch ceased {{publication}}, {{a group of}} intellectuals started the publication of Nor Haratch (literally New <b>Forward).</b> A limited <b>liability</b> company was established as owner. The first issue of Nor Haratch was published on 27 October 2009. The editorial staff included Haroutiun Gobelian (Executive Editor), Jiraïr Tcholakian (Director of Publication), Nora Baroutjian and Aram Kerovpyan, and correspondents in Armenia and the Middle East. With its new, independent staff, administration and ownership, Nor Haratch {{should be considered a}} separate new publication, rather than a continuation of the historical Haratch.|$|R

25|$|The {{joint company}} {{obtained}} Acts of Pariament in 1846 {{to cover the}} first {{three of the four}} railways, and to reform itself as the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company (SUR). The new company was authorised to take over the Shrewsbury Canal and to buy the Montgomery Canal and the Shropshire Canal. The intent behind the acts was to build railways at a reduced cost, by using the existing routes of the canals the company owned. New share capital of £3.3 million could be raised, with an additional £1.1 million if required. Holders of shares in the existing canal companies exchanged them for new shares. The Ellesmere and Chester was valued at £250,004, the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction at £150,000, and the Shrewsbury at £75,000. The company carried <b>forward</b> debts and <b>liabilities</b> of £800,207.|$|R
50|$|Market-based, legislation-mediated campaigns like Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and the Precautionary Principle {{are among}} {{numerous}} campaigns {{that have a}} Zero Waste slogan hung on them by means of claims they will ineluctably lead to policies of Zero Waste. At the moment, {{there is no evidence}} that EPR will increase reuse, rather than merely moving discard and disposal into private-sector dumping contracts. The Precautionary Principle is put <b>forward</b> to shift <b>liability</b> for proving new chemicals are safe from the public (acting as guinea pig) to the company introducing them. As such, its relation to Zero Waste is dubious. Likewise, many organizations, cities and counties have embraced a Zero Waste slogan while pressing for none of the key Zero Waste changes. In fact, it is common for many such to simply state that recycling is their entire goal. Many commercial or industrial companies claim to embrace Zero Waste but usually mean no more than a major materials recycling effort, having no bearing on product redesign. Examples include Staples, Home Depot, Toyota, General Motors and computer take-back campaigns. Earlier social justice campaigns have successfully pressured McDonald’s to change their meat purchasing practices and Nike to change its labor practices in Southeast Asia. Those were both based on the idea that organized consumers can be active participants in the economy and not just passive subjects. However, the announced and enforced goal of the public campaign is critical. A goal to reduce waste generation or dumping through greater recycling will not achieve a goal of product redesign and so cannot reasonably be called a Zero Waste campaign.|$|R
