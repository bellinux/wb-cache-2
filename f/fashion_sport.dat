30|$|The {{descriptive}} {{research design}} behind {{this article is}} based on a secondary data analysis model that uses an organized method of locating, assembling, and evaluating a body of sources on a particular topic within a set of specific criteria, and drawing on snowball and purposive sampling methods (Hanington and Martin 2012). Descriptive research designs help provide answers to the questions of who, what, when, where, and how to obtain information concerning the current status of the phenomena and to describe “what exists” with respect to a situation (Brennen 2017). This makes it an ideal approach to study a nascent field and how wearable technology influences ideas across disciplines—in this instance: <b>fashion,</b> <b>sport,</b> performance, data analytics and material science. Arguably, wearable technology is gaining most widespread traction in sport, where tennis and fashion have a long standing and enduring relationship. Therefore, wearables in tennis costume seemed the most constructive parameters within which to explore the interrelationship of data, drama, fashion and fabric.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a sociolinguistic survey of students conducted {{on the basis of a}} corpus of interviews gathered at the Institute of Philology and Cross Cultural Communication, Volgograd State University. The experimental study was aimed at the recognition of loan-words belonging to different thematic groups by the undergraduates and graduates. The findings of the research may be referred to the solution of ecolinguistic problems as they are oriented to researching the language speakers' mental processes while assimilating foreign words. The analysis has shown that the students' foreign language competence may not only define the variety of associations referring to the loan-word meanings, but is also able to lead to false interpretations. The contrastive analysis of the findings in the junior and senior groups of students revealed that the quantity of zero reactions to the foreign words awareness was almost equal. However, the undergraduates' reaction to the semantics of imported words was more creative, which testifies to their willingness in exposing their linguistic skills. The involvement of students in some activities (business, IT, <b>fashion,</b> <b>sport,</b> entertainment) is probably a significant motivating factor in assimilating foreign words, but the interpretation of loanwords in the sphere of politics and terminology is a problematic issue for the young native speakers of Russian...|$|E
40|$|This study {{begins with}} the {{identification}} of some problems found in my writing classes. Developing cliché claim and copying other person’s opinion have been the main problems followed by the failure to develop sufficient examples to support the claim and eliminate the number of grammatical and mechanical error in students’ essays. I also {{tried to find out}} the reason through some discussions both with students and colleagues. It appeared that students reading habit is unsatisfying and as the result they do not expand their critical thinking skill. The other significant reason is students mostly think that writing is a difficult assignment. At the beginning students were introduced to how to find the issue for WHAT TO WRITE. They need to get involved in interest mapping activity. In potency mapping, students are trying to discover the following: what my area of interest is, the kinds of topic I look for when I browse internet and the issues I couldn’t miss. In the classes, it was found that their interest mostly covering the topic on music, <b>fashion,</b> <b>sport,</b> teen’s lifestyle, and travelling. Whereas, the unfavorable topics are political issue and education. Afterwards, students conducted brainstorming in groups having the same interest. On the next phase the students started planning ahead on HOW TO BEGIN WRITING by making an outline and present it in class conference. Their friends contributed a lot of ideas to support the proposed claim. Later, the students were assigned to find related data from various resources to get as many examples as possible to strengthen their claim. This is related to the activity to decide WHICH FACT SUPPORTS THE CLAIM. Their writing draft was checked by their friends in peer-editing. The comments given on HOW TO ELABORATE THE CLAIM were used to revise the draft before the final draft was submitted. As the last process, the evaluated draft was published in the form of mini magazine to be distributed to other students. This last activity has become the most favorable part for the students. At the end of the semester, some benefits attained are as follow: (1.) students started writing more easily, (2.) they participated actively in class conference, (3.) reading skill is also promoted, (4.) no more plagiarism found, (5.) error in diction and grammar can be minimized by learning from others, (6.) reaching larger audience by distributing the magazines to other classes, and (7.) they are challenged to write more productively...|$|E
