5000|$|<b>Dipivefrine,</b> given topically as an anti-glaucoma drug, is bioactivated to epinephrine.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{side effects of}} <b>dipivefrine</b> are burning, {{stinging}} and other irritations of the eye. Possible, but uncommon, side effects are those of epinephrine: tachycardia (fast heartbeat), hypertension (high blood pressure) and arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat).|$|E
50|$|<b>Dipivefrine</b> (INN) or dipivefrin (USAN), {{trade name}} Propine among others, is a prodrug of epinephrine, {{and is used}} to treat open-angle glaucoma. It is {{available}} as a 0.1% ophthalmic solution. It is no longer available in the United States.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dipivefrine</b> penetrates {{the cornea}} and is then {{hydrolysed}} to epinephrine by esterase enzymes. It increases outflow of the aqueous humour and also reduces its formation (mediated by its action on α1 and α2 receptors), thus reducing pressure inside the eye. It also increases the conductivity of trabecular filtering cells (a β2 receptor mediated action). It is preferred to epinephrine {{because it is}} longer acting, more consistent in its action and better tolerated.|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{develop and}} {{validate}} an HPLC method for the separation and quantification of co-eluted <b>dipivefrine,</b> a prodrug, and its active form, epinephrine, in a standardized pharmaceutical sample. Background. The current USP methods for determination of individual compounds are {{not suitable for}} their detection when co-eluted. To our knowledge, there is no published analytical method using HPLC with Photo-Diode-Array (PDA) detector for the simultaneous detection of the co-eluent which {{is required for the}} development of novel <b>dipivefrine</b> dosage form. Methods. Different strengths of mobile phases were evaluated using methanol and acetonitrile. Several reversedphase C 18 and Hilic columns at various pressures and flow rates using Waters Alliance System with PDA detector were evaluated. A 2. 0 mg/mL standard stock solution of each compound was prepared in 0. 0015 N HCL solvent. Standard calibration curves ranging from 20 - 200 ¼g/mL were injected and plotted for both compounds. The linearity of the injections, the reproducibility of quantification, the minimum detection limit, and the intra and inter assay variation for each compound were tested and validated. Results. Separation was achieved using C 18 column 43 (3. 9 mm X 300 mm, 10 ¼m) with a flow rate of 2. 0 ml/min at wavelength of 254 nm at ambient temperature. (More data are being collected and will be presented in the poster). Conclusion. A reliable and sensitive reversed-phase HPLC method was developed and validated for the quantification of <b>dipivefrine</b> and epinephrine from one sample. (Project in progress, more data will be provided to confirm conclusion). Grants. President 2 ̆ 7 s Faculty Research 2 ̆ 6 Development Grant FY 2014...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{publications}} {{have suggested}} that the long term use of topical antiglaucoma medications may be detrimental to the outcome of trabeculectomy. In order to investigate this further, the effect of several adrenergic agents and a preservative on the proliferation and viability of human Tenon's capsule fibroblasts in tissue culture were examined. The following compounds were tested: adrenaline (Eppy 1 % and pure adrenaline base 1 %, Smith & Nephew Pharmaceuticals Ltd); <b>dipivefrine</b> hydrochloride (Propine 0. 1 % and pure <b>dipivefrine</b> hydrochloride 0. 1 % Allergan Ltd and Allergan Pharmaceuticals (Ireland) Ltd); benzalkonium chloride (pure benzalkonium chloride 0. 01 %, Sigma Chemical Company Ltd); the two adrenaline based preparations were also tested in the presence of an antioxidant. None of the tested compounds stimulated the proliferation of fibroblasts. The commercial products tested, their pure compounds, and the preservative all inhibited proliferation and had toxic effects on the cells. In the presence of antioxidant, commercial Eppy and pure adrenaline base appeared to have less effect on proliferation and toxicity. These findings are discussed with reference to the outcome of trabeculectomy...|$|E
