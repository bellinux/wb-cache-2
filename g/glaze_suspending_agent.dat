Ibuprofen pediatric suspension (25 mg/ 5 mL) was formulated with grewia gum (0. 5 % w/v) as the <b>suspending</b> <b>agent.</b> Similar suspensions of Ibuprofen containing either sodium carboxymethylcellulose (Na-CMC) or hydroxymethylpropylcellu-lose (HPMC) were also produced. The suspensions were evaluated for ease of redispersion, sedimentation, rheological properties, {{and the effect of}} aging on the rheological properties at 25 °C. The particle size and particle size distributions of the dispersed solute were determined. The redispersion time was 19, 11, and 0. 5 min, respectively, for formulation containing Na-CMC, HPMC, and GG. The sedimentation volumes were 0. 05, 0. 05, and 0. 125 mL, respectively, for Na-CMC, HPMC, and GG. Viscosities of suspensions at spindle speed of 25 rpm were of the order: GG>HPMC>Na-CMC when freshly prepared and of the order: HPMC>GG>Na-CMC within 6 months of storage. The particles size was 72. 72, 73. 82, 81. 93, and 83. 41 μm, respectively, for suspensions containing Na-CMC, ibuprofen alone, HPMC, and GG. Greatest hysteresis was observed in formulation containing HPMC. All the formulations were stable. It was our conclusion that the difference in the physicochemical properties of ibuprofen pediatric formulations was influenced more by the <b>suspending</b> <b>agent</b> used in the formulations than the drug. GG combined better redispersion with minimal changes in viscosity on storage compared to Na-CMC and HPMC as <b>suspending</b> <b>agent.</b> Thus GG may serve as a good <b>suspending</b> <b>agent</b> requiring no further aid in suspension redispersibility.

It was observed that differences exist among the rate of paracetamol dissolution from the samples, particularly at the early stages. For nine of the brands, paracetamol dissolution varied between 72 % and 100 % at 15 minutes. One of the samples showed a very unsatisfactory rate and extent of drug dissolution as only 39 % and 52 % paracetamol was released after 15 and 30 minutes respectively. The effect of two commonly used <b>suspending</b> <b>agents,</b> CMC-Na and Avicel, on the release of paracetamol was studied using four laboratory-made suspensions.

40|$|The Tamarind seed {{polysaccharide}} (TSP) possesses properties {{like high}} viscosity, broad pH tolerance, no carcinogenicity, mucoadhesive nature, and biocompatibility. Since suspensions are thermodynamically unstable, {{it requires a}} <b>suspending</b> <b>agent</b> which reduces the rate of settling and permits easy redispersion of any settled particulate matter. So {{an attempt was made}} to use this polysaccharide as <b>suspending</b> <b>agent</b> in the formulation of Nimesulide suspension.

The average size of the particles in the suspension was found to be 35. 4 µm and the minimum and maximum particle size were 17. 3 and 70. 3 µm respectively. The drug content of all the formulations was in the range of 95 - 98. 3 %. The rheological study of the formulation F 3 indicated that as the RPM increases the viscosity decreases, confirming the shear thinning nature of the suspension.

The samples were used at 0. 5 &#x 0025; w/v as <b>suspending</b> <b>agents</b> in acetaminophen acetaminophen suspension to deliver 125 mg/ 5 mL acetaminophen. A binary mixture of F 2 and F 4 (1 : 1) was also used. Similar suspensions of acetaminophen containing either hydroxymethylpropylcellulose (HPMC) or tragacanth gum (TRAGA) were produced. Some physicochemical properties of the formulations were evaluated. The rheological properties of acetaminophen-containing treated okra gums (F 2 -F 5) were generally similar. Changes in viscosity with storage were slower in the F 2 -F 5 formulations as compared with F 1. Particle size and particle size distribution were different for all formulations, and hysteresis was a function of time and the <b>suspending</b> <b>agent</b> used. The re-dispersion time of the formulations with treated okra gums was generally shorter than that observed with the untreated okra gum. The use of a binary mixture of F 2 and F 4 resulted in different physicochemical properties from those of either F 2 or F 4. The physicochemical properties of the formulations were comparable to those with HPMC and TRAGA.
