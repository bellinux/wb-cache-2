5|$|Swans {{and geese}} usually start {{to arrive in}} late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink-footed goose, barnacle goose and Taiga bean goose. The swans tend to fly off {{in the day and}} return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common pochard, northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, <b>golden</b> <b>plover,</b> snipe and ruff.|$|E
5|$|Clover, sorrel, nettle and thistle are common, {{and grow}} wild in Greater Manchester. Common heather (Calluna vulgaris) dominates the uplands, such as Saddleworth Moor, which lies within the South Pennines and Dark Peak {{area of the}} Peak District National Park. The Rochdale Canal {{harbours}} floating water-plantain (Luronium), an endangered aquatic plant. In 2002, Plantlife International launched its County Flowers campaign, asking {{members of the public}} to nominate and vote for a wild flower emblem for their county. Common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), a plant with fluffy white plumes native to wet hollows on high moors, was announced as the county flower of Greater Manchester. The house sparrow, common starling, and common blackbird are among the most populous bird species in Greater Manchester; Eurasian magpie and feral pigeon are common and breed in habitats across the county. The South Pennines support internationally important numbers of European <b>golden</b> <b>plover,</b> curlew, merlin and twite.|$|E
40|$|<b>Golden</b> <b>plovers</b> and Grey Plovers Pluvialis spp. {{all have}} very {{distinct}} breeding plumage rich in contrast, with a conspicuous black belly and breast bordered by a bright white fringe. Eurasian <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> are known partly to replace their breeding plumage with striped yellow feathers during incubation, different from both breeding and non-breeding plumages. In this study a similar partial breeding moult {{was observed in}} Pacific <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> and American <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> caught on the nest or collected during incubation, although the feathers did not differ clearly from those of non-breeders. This moult starts during incubation and precedes the post-breeding moult into non-breeding plumage. Because the lighter feathers reduce {{the contrast between the}} black belly and the white flanks, we suggest that during incubation the plumage characteristic that {{plays an important role in}} mate choice is no longer important; at this stage it is better for the bird to be inconspicuous. Additional information on museum skins of <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> and of Grey Plovers indicated that only the three <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> undergo this partial moult, but that Grey Plovers in general retain full breeding plumage throughout incubation. The three <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> also resemble each other in their generally very passive nest defence strategies. In contrast, the larger Grey Plovers actively chase and attack aerial and ground predators. Thus, a reduced conspicuousness of the body plumage during incubation is likely to benefit the <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> more than the Grey Plover. We suggest that nest defence behaviour, plumage characteristics and perhaps size have co-evolved as a response to different selection pressures in <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> and Grey Plover, but alternative hypotheses are also discussed...|$|R

Thousands of Eurasian wigeon, northern pintail, northern shoveller also use the backwaters.|$|E
25|$|Few animals live {{in these}} areas; birds, mostly, {{such as the}} willow warbler, the meadow pipit, the {{northern}} wheatear, and these rarer ones: the European <b>golden</b> <b>plover,</b> the Eurasian dotterel, the snow bunting, and the Lapland longspur. The willow ptarmigan is relatively common, whereas the rock ptarmigan is found only on the highest peaks. For many of these species, Fulufj√§llet is the southernmost part of their range in Sweden.|$|E
50|$|Several {{species of}} wading birds breed on the reserve, {{including}} oystercatcher, redshank, ringed plover, and little ringed plover.

40|$|Samples {{of breast}} {{feathers}} of <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> {{were collected from}} live birds captured in spring and autumn staging areas in The Netherlands. Three types of feathers were distinguished: winter and summer feathers, and a peculiar type, called the striped feather. Striped feathers were not found in spring, but made up about 20 % of the feathers in samples collected in autumn. Examination of skins of birds collected on the breeding grounds showed that striped feathers develop on the breast and belly of <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> around {{the last week of}} incubation. After arrival in The Netherlands, striped as well as summer feathers are replaced by winter feathers (post-breeding moult). The moult, on the breeding grounds, of part of the ventral summer plumage to special (short-lasting) striped feathers is named the partial breeding moult, and appears hitherto undescribed in other birds. The appearance of striped feathers makes the summer plumage of <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> less contrasting. This leads us to propose that the balance between selection for a distinctive plumage and for camouflage changes {{in the course of the}} season and has thus lead to the evolution of this peculiar moult. ...|$|R

25|$|The atoll {{supports}} {{a large population}} of sea and shorebirds, with up to 26 species present. Species breeding during 1988 included the brown booby, red-footed booby, great frigatebird, red-tailed tropicbird, sooty tern, white tern, brown noddy, and possibly the reef heron. Migratory birds present included the bristle-thighed curlew, turnstone, wandering tattler, <b>golden</b> <b>plover,</b> and the sanderling. The densest bird populations are on three islets {{to the north of}} Sibylla: North (Kita), Kamwome and an unnamed islet. Bokak is the only known breeding ground of Christmas shearwater and possibly Bulwer's petrel.|$|E

25|$|Lough Leane, and {{the other}} lakes to a lesser extent, support {{wintering}} birds that travel south from higher latitudes. These species include redwing, fieldfare, <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> and waterfowl such as teal, goldeneye, wigeon, pochard and whooper swan. The park's native bird populations are augmented by migrant species in both winter and summer. A small flock of Greenland white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons flavirostris) from the world population of approximately 12,000 migrates to winter on boglands in the Killarney Valley within the park. The numbers of this bird that stay in the park are currently low, at less than twenty individuals. This population {{is important because it}} is the most southerly in Ireland {{and one of the few}} remaining populations remaining that feed entirely on bogland, and whose habitat almost entirely lies within a protected area.|$|E
50|$|Read's Island is an RSPB reserve {{due to its}} {{importance}} for birdlife. Species that migrate or live year-round on the island include ground-nesting avocets (10% of the entire UK population), grey goose, pink-footed goose, marsh harriers, lapwings, wigeons, curlews, <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> and fallow deer.|$|R
2500|$|After twenty-nine {{days out}} of sight of land, on 7 October 1492, the crew spotted [...] "mmense flocks of birds", some of which his sailors trapped and {{determined}} to be [...] "field" [...] birds (probably Eskimo curlews and American <b>golden</b> <b>plovers).</b> Columbus changed course to follow their flight.|$|R
50|$|A {{comparison}} of dates and migratory patterns {{leads to the}} conclusion that Eskimo curlews and American <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> were the most likely shore birds to have attracted the attention of Christopher Columbus to the nearby Americas in early October 1492, after 65 days at sea out of sight of land.|$|R
25|$|Harold Gatty {{suggested}} that long-distance Polynesian voyaging followed the seasonal paths of bird migrations. In ‚ÄúThe Raft Book,‚Äù a survival guide {{he wrote for}} the U.S. military during World War II, Gatty outlined various Polynesian navigation techniques Allied sailors or aviators wrecked at sea could use {{to find their way}} to land. There are some references in their oral traditions to the flight of birds and some say that there were range marks onshore pointing to distant islands in line with the West Pacific Flyway. A voyage from Tahiti, the Tuamotus or the Cook Islands to New Zealand might have followed the migration of the long-tailed cuckoo (Eudynamys taitensis) just as the voyage from Tahiti to Hawaii would coincide with the track of the Pacific <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> (Pluvialis fulva) and the bristle-thighed curlew (Numenius tahitiensis). It is also believed that Polynesians employed shore-sighting birds as did many seafaring peoples. One theory is that they would have taken a frigatebird (Fregata) with them. These birds refuse to land on the water as their feathers will become waterlogged making it impossible to fly. When the voyagers thought they were close to land they may have released the bird, which would either fly towards land or else return to the canoe.|$|E

Over 70 aquatic and bankside vascular plants have been recorded including frogbit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae), flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus), wood club-rush (Scirpus sylvaticus) and lesser water-plantain (Baldellia ranunculoides). Over 100 species of aquatic invertebrates inhabit the ditches including one nationally rare soldier fly, (Odontomyia ornata) and 13 nationally scarce species including the water beetles Agabus uliginosus, Hydaticus transversalis and Helophorus nanus. In winter the flooded fields provide food for large numbers of waterfowl with several thousand lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), hundreds of snipe (Gallinago gallinago) and smaller numbers of <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> (Pluvialis apricaria) and dunlin (Calidris alpina) regularly present. Over two hundred Bewick's swans (Cygnus bewickii) have been recorded, making the site an internationally important wintering ground for this species. Raptor species such as short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), merlin (Falco columbarius) and peregrine (Falco peregrinus) regularly hunt over the site in winter. Vertebrate species present include grass snake (Natrix natrix) and common frog Rana temporaria. Otters (Lutra lutra) are regularly recorded on the site.|$|E

40|$|Before {{predictable}} {{periods of}} high nutritional demand and {{little or no}} intake, vertebrates store fuel mainly composed of energy-dense lipids or energy-poor but protein-rich muscle tissue. Documenting contrasts in fuel composition and storage patterns within species, or even within individuals, would greatly help to elucidate the functional significance {{of the variety of}} storage strategies demonstrated in birds. We show here that the 40 ‚Äì 50 g mass gain of 200 g in Eurasian <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> (Pluvialis apricaria) in autumn in The Netherlands consists of fat only, but that the similar gain in body mass in spring consists of proteinaceous tissue (pectoral and other skeletal muscle and possibly skin tissue). That the same <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> store energy in autumn and store protein in spring suggests that they face energy deficits in early winter and risk protein deficits in spring, especially perhaps after arrival on the breeding grounds in late April and early May. In autumn and winter their diet consists largely of protein-rich earthworms, but upon arrival on Low Arctic and montane tundras, <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> tend to eat berries which are rich in sugars but notably poor in proteins. We therefore propose that the build-up of proteinaceous tissue in spring reflects a strategic storage of a nutritional resource that is likely to be in short supply somewhat later in the year. ...|$|R
