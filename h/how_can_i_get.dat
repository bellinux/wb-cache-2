6000|$|... "But <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> out {{of making}} a last raid?" [...] I demanded, with the cocksureness of youth. [...] "There always {{has to be a}} last, you know, to anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{bridge is}} gone," [...] said Jenny. [...] "When I came across after breakfast it was there, and now it's {{over on the}} other side, and <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back home?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, me! <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>get</b> {{on without}} Phebe? Couldn't she stay, just so I could see her? I'd pay her board {{rather than have}} her go, I'm so fond of her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{has been}} left to me?" [...] I said despondingly and {{spreading}} out my hands. [...] "My pistol gone, and did I not give Runi the tinder-box, and the little box with a cock painted on it to you? I had no return--not even the blow-pipe. <b>How,</b> then, <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> me a wife?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I suppose {{hundreds}} {{of young girls}} are from one reason or other left just in this way, and have, without any previous preparation in their education and habits, to face the question, <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a living? ...|$|E
6000|$|Danny {{hung his}} head. Finally {{he looked up}} and caught a kindly twinkle in old Mr. Toad's eyes. [...] "Mr. Toad, <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a long tail like my cousin Whitefoot of the Green Forest?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a long story. I've been a {{prisoner}} twice, and I was afraid I was about done {{for when the}} guards up and ran away from the prison and let me and a crowd of Cubans escape. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back to my ship?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Can {{you tell}} me," [...] I said pleasantly, [...] "what {{is the name}} of your nearest town or city? how far it is from this place, and <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It may be you <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> am {{on my way}} to Meeker's Mill for {{a little}} outing. Perhaps you could tell me where Meeker's Mill is, and <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> best <b>get</b> there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{said mother}} was in a very low state of {{vitality}} and that she must be very careful, which was easy enough to say. But <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> her to rest and to diet? You have seen how little she cares for the doctor's orders. He {{told her not to}} touch alcohol." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Running away, you fool!" [...] muttered the stranger, whose temper {{had evidently}} {{suffered}} grievously during the weary, cold journey from Chelwood. [...] "I'll break your satané head {{if anything happens}} to the beasts. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back to Bath save the way I came? Do you think I want {{to spend the night in}} this God-forsaken hole?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Two days later, at the {{invitation}} of General Palmer, we joined his party in a trip over the short-line railway to Cripple Creek, traveling in his private car, and the luxury of this novel experience made my wife's eyes shine with girlish delight.--I professed alarm, [...] "I don't know where all this glory is going to land us," [...] I warned, [...] "after this Aladdin's-lamp luxury and leisure, <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> you back into washing dishes and canning fruit in West Salem?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] said Ann Veronica, {{with the}} air of one who shares a difficulty, [...] "I've promised to go. I didn't realize--I don't see <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> out of it now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “In {{the first}} place I am {{going to take your}} clothes,” Stephen said. “You can say that you were insensible when I {{stripped}} you; but first I {{want you to tell me}} <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> out.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, don't you see, foolish girl, that it {{will take}} you away from me? You will, of course, want to keep house for your brother, and I have become so used to you, short though our {{intercourse}} has been, that I don't see <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> on at all without you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Having secured his dog to {{the handle}} of the door and disregarded the {{intensity}} of her gaze, Mr. Lavender walked back towards the Garden City with a pamphlet {{in one hand and a}} crutch-handled stick in the other. Restoring the ham to its nest behind his feet, Joe finished the bottle of Bass. [...] "This is a bit of all right!" [...] he thought dreamily. [...] "Lie down, you bitch! Quiet! <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> my nap while you make that row? Lie down! That's better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I go {{in there}} <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> out again?" [...] Otter thought sadly. [...] "After all, perhaps I should have done better to return {{while it was still}} light, for then, by the help of my staff and the rope, I might have made shift to climb the {{overhanging}} ledge of rock, but to try this now were madness. I will go back and sit in the cave with the ghosts of the god and his dead till the morning comes again, though I do not crave their company." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must {{burn the}} house down!" [...] {{said the voice}} of the rabbit, and Alice called out as loud as she could [...] "if you do, I'll set Dinah at you!" [...] This caused silence again, and while Alice was {{thinking}} [...] "but <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> Dinah here?" [...] she found to her great delight that she was getting smaller: very soon she was able to get up out of the uncomfortable position in which she had been lying, and in two or three minutes more she was once more three inches high.|$|E
6000|$|... "'In {{rising to}} address you, with my impromptu speech {{carefully}} tucked into my vest pocket, I {{am reminded of}} the story of the two Irishmen, Mike and Pat, who were riding on the Pullman. Both of them, I forgot to say, were sailors in the Navy. It seems Mike had the lower berth and by and by he heard a terrible racket from the upper, and when he yelled up {{to find out what the}} trouble was, Pat answered, [...] "Shure an' bedad an' <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>get</b> a night's sleep at all, at all?

6000|$|... "Listen!" [...] cried Jack eagerly. [...] "Of course I will, my good fellow! I did {{not know}} you had any plans. Out with them!

6000|$|As he spoke, the boy {{struck a}} volume that {{lay on the}} wide ledge, with a petulant energy that sent it {{fluttering}} down into the court-yard below. Half-ashamed and half-amused, young Gaston peeped {{to see if this}} random shot had hit any one. But all was quiet and deserted now; so, with a boyish laugh and a daring glance at the dangerous descent, he said to the doves cooing on the roof overhead: [...] "Here's a fine pretext for escape. Being locked in, <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> my lesson unless I fetch the book? Tell no tales of the time I linger, and you shall be well fed, my pretty birds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Man alive, don't I tell you? A diseased governor? Now, it's {{too late}} for me to begin shovelling and sifting at alphabeds and grammar-books. I'm {{getting to be a}} old bird, and I want to take it easy. But I want some reading--some fine bold reading, some splendid book in a gorging Lord-Mayor's-Show of wollumes' (probably meaning gorgeous, but misled by {{association}} of ideas); 'as'll reach right down your pint of view, and take time to go by you. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> that reading, Wegg? By,' tapping him on the breast with the head of his thick stick, 'paying a man truly qualified to do it, so much an hour (say twopence) to come and do it.' ...|$|E
60|$|My friends, we {{who have}} to earn our bread and to take honest money for honest work, know well enough what trouble {{we have to keep}} out of our daily life that mean, base spirit of self-interest, rather than of duty, which never asks of anything, 'Is it right?' but only 'Will it pay me?'--which, instead of thinking, How can I do this work as well as possible? is perpetually thinking, <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> most money for the least work? We have to fight against that spirit in worldly matters. For we know, that if we yield to it,--if we {{sacrifice}} our duty to our pleasure or our gain,--it is certain to make us do something mean, covetous, even fraudulent, in the eyes of God and man.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the concept}} of {{crowdsourcing}} is relatively new, many potential participants have questions about the AMT marketplace. For example, {{a common set of}} questions that pop up in an 'introduction to crowdsourcing and AMT' session are the following: What type of tasks can be completed in the marketplace? How much does it cost? <b>How</b> fast <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> results back? <b>How</b> big is the AMT marketplace? The answers for these questions remain largely anecdotal and based on personal observations and experiences. To understand better what types of tasks are being completed today using crowdsourcing techniques, we started collecting data about the AMT marketplace. We present a preliminary analysis of the dataset and provide directions for interesting future research. ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{want the}} use of the money just for one day. I {{certainly}} won't need it all. I just want to feel that I have as much as that in case I need it. Now, my dear old daddy, do please not ask any questions, but be very nice and good, and tell me <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> these five hundred pounds.' ...|$|R
2500|$|The tour sported {{the same}} electric, {{over-the-top}} theatricality {{the band was}} known for during the Fever era. [...] "I really miss wearing costumes and makeup," [...] Urie told Spin. [...] "I love throwing a big production. I've recently been reading about Tesla coils and I'm {{trying to figure out}} <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> one that sits on the stage and shoots sparks without hurting anybody." ...|$|R
6000|$|Augusta made no answer, and {{presently}} Jeannie dozed off. Her sister {{looked at}} her with eager affection. [...] "She is giving up," [...] she said to herself, [...] "and, if she gives up, she will die. I know it, it is because we are not going away. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> the money, now that that horrible man is gone? <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> it?" [...] and she buried her head in her hand and thought. Presently an idea struck her: she might go back to Meeson and eat her words, and sell him the copyright of her new book for £100, as the agreement provided. That would not be enough, however; for travelling with an invalid is expensive; but she might offer to bind herself over to him for a term of years as a tame author, like those who worked in the Hutches. She was sure that he would be glad to get her, if only he could do so at his own price. It would be slavery worse than any penal servitude, and even now she shudders at the prospect of prostituting her great abilities to the necessities of such work as Meeson's made their thousands out of--work out of which every spark of originality was stamped into nothingness, as though it were the mark of the Beast. Yes, it would be dreadful--it would break her heart; but she was prepared to have her heart broken and her genius wrung out of her by inches, if only she could get two hundred pounds wherewith to take Jeannie away to the South of France. Mr. Meeson would, no doubt, make a hard bargain--the hardest he could; but still, if she would consent to bind herself for a sufficient number of years at a sufficiently low salary, he would probably advance her a hundred pounds, besides the hundred for the copyright of the new book.|$|E
6000|$|Sister Mollie was {{the grand}} {{repository}} of these; {{all the little}} Josephs came to her for advice and assistance. It was Mollie who for troubled small brothers and sisters did such sums in division as this: <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a ten-cent present for Emmy and a fifteen-cent one for Jimmy out of eighteen cents? Or, how can seven sticks of candy be divided among eight people so that each shall have one? It was Mollie who advised regarding the purchase of ribbon and crepe paper. It was Mollie who put the finishing touches {{to most of the}} little gifts. In short, all through December Mollie was weighed down under an avalanche of responsibility. It speaks volumes for her sagacity and skill that she never got things mixed up or made any such terrible mistake as letting one little Joseph find out what another was going to give him. [...] "Dead" [...] secrecy was the keystone of all plans and confidences.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Elizabeth; 'I {{should feel}} as if I was {{suffering}} a little for my madness. Oh! how I hope Papa will speak to me about it. If he does not, I shall see his displeasure in his eyes, and oh! I could bear anything better than the silent stern {{way in which he}} used to look at me, once before, when I had behaved very ill. And then, to-morrow is Sunday, and I shall scarcely see him all day, and he will have no time to speak to me; and <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> through a Sunday, feeling that he is angry with me? how shall I teach the children, or do anything as usual? Anne, what do you think was the first sound in my ears when I awoke this morning, and has been returning upon me all day?--the words, [...] "It was a tree to be desired to make one wise."' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{this is a}} very {{peculiar}} bit of business," [...] Colonel Kelmscott answered, humming and hawing {{with obvious}} hesitation. [...] "It isn't quite in the regular way of banking, I believe. Perhaps, indeed, I ought rather to have put it into the hands of my solicitor.
