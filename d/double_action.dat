25|$|The weapon's {{action is}} similar to that of a revolver, using a {{rotating}} magazine. Since the Striker uses a conventional <b>double</b> <b>action</b> only trigger and a very large and heavy cylinder (compared to handguns), Walker added a pre-wound clock-work spring to revolve the magazine which proved to make loading the weapon slow. The design was changed into having a cocking lever on the right side of the barrel.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S. the {{traditional}} single-action revolver still reigned supreme {{until the late}} 19th century. In Europe, however, arms makers were quick to adopt the double-action trigger. While the US was producing weapons like the Model 1873, the Europeans were building double-action models like the French MAS Modèle 1873 and the somewhat later British Enfield Mk I and II revolvers (Britain relied on cartridge conversions of the earlier Beaumont–Adams double-action prior to this). Colt's first attempt at a <b>double</b> <b>action</b> revolver {{to compete with the}} European manufacturers was the Colt Model 1877, which earned lasting notoriety for its overly complex, expensive and fragile trigger mechanism, which in addition to failing frequently, also had a terrible trigger pull unless given the attentions of a competent gunsmith.|$|E

40|$|Women's work {{activities}} are often characterised by 'non-formal actions' (such as giving support). Gender differences in ergonomics {{may be due}} to this peculiarity. We applied the method of organisational congruencies (MOC) to ascertain the 'non-formal' work portion of nurses employed in three hospital units (haematology, emergency room and general medicine) during the three work shifts in a major University Hospital in Rome, Italy. We recorded a total of 802 technical actions performed by nine nurses in 72 h of work. Twenty-six percent of the actions in direct patient's care were communicative actions (mainly giving psychological support) while providing physical care. These 'double actions' are often not considered to be a formal part of the job by hospital management. In our case study, the 'non-formal' work of nurses (psychological support) is mainly represented by <b>double</b> <b>actions</b> while taking physical care of the patients. The dual task paradigm in gender oriented research is discussed in terms of its implications in prevention in occupational health. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: The main {{purpose of the study was}} to assess all the formal and non-formal activities of women in the nursing work setting. Offering psychological support to patients is often not considered to be a formal part of the job. Our case study found that nurses receive no explicit guidelines on this activity and no time is assigned to perform it. In measuring the burden of providing psychological support to patients, we found that this is often done while nurses are performing tasks of physical care for the patients (<b>double</b> <b>actions).</b> The article discusses the significance of non-formal psychological work load of women nurses through <b>double</b> <b>actions</b> from the ergonomic point view...|$|R
40|$|Exact chiral {{symmetry}} at finite {{lattice spacing}} would preclude the axial anomaly. In order {{to describe a}} continuum quantum field theory of Dirac fermions, lattice actions with purported exact chiral symmetry must break the flavor-singlet axial symmetry. We demonstrate that this is indeed the case by using a minimally <b>doubled</b> fermion <b>action.</b> For simplicity we consider the Abelian axial anomaly in two dimensions. At finite lattice spacing and with gauge interactions, the axial anomaly arises from non-conservation of the flavor-singlet current. Similar non-conservation also leads to the axial anomaly {{in the case of}} the naive lattice <b>action.</b> For minimally <b>doubled</b> <b>actions,</b> however, fine tuning of the action and axial current is necessary to arrive at the anomaly. Conservation of the flavor non-singlet vector current additionally requires the current to be fine tuned. Finally we determine that the chiral projection of a minimally <b>doubled</b> fermion <b>action</b> can be used to arrive at a lattice theory with an undoubled Dirac fermion possessing the correct anomaly in the continuum limit.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{elucidate}} the mechanism of <b>double</b> component <b>action</b> potentials in the posterior approach to the atrioventricular (AV) junctional area. <b>Double</b> component <b>action</b> potentials are often associated with activation delay and therefore might be a marker of the location of the so-called slow pathway. The AV junction was scanned for <b>double</b> component <b>action</b> potentials in Langendorff perfused pig and dog hearts, using conventional microelectrode recordings. Characteristics of these action potentials were investigated during basic and premature stimulation and cooling of the anterior approach to the node. During basic stimulation, <b>double</b> component <b>action</b> potentials were recorded in 19 out of 20 hearts. In 74 % of these cases, the second component occurred before the His deflection. During premature stimulation this percentage was 50 %, while delay between the two components always increased. In 80 % of the cases, the amplitude of the two components became < 20 mV during progressive shortening of the coupling interval. The first component was generated by activation in superficial layers, the second one by activation in deeper layers. Cooling of the anterior region revealed that the second component was caused by activation arriving from the anterior region. <b>Double</b> component <b>action</b> potentials in the posterior approach to the AV node are generated by the asynchronous arrival of wave fronts in different, weakly coupled layers or by the summation of asynchronously arriving wave fronts. They are not always associated with activation delay in the slow pathwa...|$|R

40|$|We study a {{class of}} nearest-neighbor {{minimally}} <b>doubled</b> <b>actions</b> which depend on 2 continuous parameters. We calculate {{the contributions of the}} 3 possible counterterms in perturbation theory, and we find that for each counterterm there are curves in the parameter space on which its coefficient vanishes. One can thus construct renormalized actions that contain only 2 counterterms instead of the 3 of the standard Karsten-Wilczek or Borici-Creutz actions. Our investigations suggest the usefulness of analogous nonperturbative searches for values of the parameters for which the number of counterterms can be reduced. They can also be an inspiration to undertake a search for ultralocal minimally <b>doubled</b> <b>actions</b> with even better counterterm-reducing properties, including the optimal case in which all counterterms can be removed. Simulations of the latter actions will be much cheaper than the cases in which one needs to add counterterms to the bare actions, like the already conveniently inexpensive standard Karsten-Wilczek fermions. Finally, we also introduce minimally doubled fermions with next-to-nearest-neighbor interactions, which depend on 4 continuous parameters, as a further possibility in the search for renormalized actions with no counterterms.
