40|$|The {{asymmetric}} bimodal exponential power (ABEP) {{distribution is}} an extension of the generalized gamma distribution to the real line via adding two parameters that fit the shape of peakedness in bimodality on the real line. The special values of peakedness parameters of the distribution are a combination of half Laplace and <b>half</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distributions</b> on the real line. The distribution has two parameters fitting the height of bimodality, so capacity of bimodality is enhanced by using these parameters. Adding a skewness parameter is considered to model asymmetry in data. The location-scale form of this distribution is proposed. The Fisher information matrix of these parameters in ABEP is obtained explicitly. Properties of ABEP are examined. Real data examples are given to illustrate the modelling capacity of ABEP. The replicated artificial data from maximum likelihood estimates of parameters of ABEP and other distributions having an algorithm for artificial data generation procedure are provided to test the similarity with real data.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} address the complex {{uncertainties}} caused by interfacing between the fuzziness and randomness of the safety problem for embankment engineering projects, and to evaluate the safety of embankment engineering projects more scientifically and reasonably, this study presents the fuzzy logic modeling of the stochastic finite element method (SFEM) based on the harmonious finite element (HFE) technique using a first-order approximation theorem. Fuzzy mathematical models of safety repertories were introduced into the SFEM to analyze the stability of embankments and foundations in order to describe the fuzzy failure procedure for the random safety performance function. The fuzzy models were developed with membership functions with half depressed gamma <b>distribution,</b> <b>half</b> depressed <b>normal</b> <b>distribution,</b> and <b>half</b> depressed echelon distribution. The fuzzy stochastic mathematical algorithm was used to comprehensively study the local failure mechanism of the main embankment section near Jingnan in the Yangtze River in terms of numerical analysis for the probability integration of reliability on the random field affected by three fuzzy factors. The result shows that the middle region of the embankment is the principal zone of concentrated failure due to local fractures. There is also some local shear failure on the embankment crust.

Results indicate that technical efficiency was observed as higher for Boro among the three types of rice, but the overall technical efficiency of rice production was found around 50 %. Although positive changes exist in TFP for the sample analyzed, the average growth rate of TFP for rice production was estimated at almost the same levels for both Translog SFA with <b>half</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> and DEA.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to incorporate a measure of risk aversion in the translog frontier cost function to estimate cost inefficiency. Risk-averse behaviour of farmers is hypothesised to reduce efficiency by leading to {{a situation in which}} the marginal value product of an input is less than price. In developing agriculture, farmers are aware of their subsistence needs and seek to minimize the probability of their incomes falling below a disaster level of income. Using such a safety first principle, a measure of risk-taking is developed and explained by socio-economic characteristics. This measure is used in the translog cost function as a fixed input and, using the frontier approach (with <b>half</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> of inefficiency disturbance), a measure of cost inefficiency is obtained. This is related to socio-economic characteristics such as education, assets and holding size. A survey data of 436 farmers for the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan is used to reach policy conclusions for reducing cost inefficiency. © 1994...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to assess the {{efficacy}} of confidence intervals for Rosenthal's fail-safe number. Although Rosenthal's estimator is highly used by researchers, its statistical properties are largely unexplored. First of all, we developed statistical theory which allowed us to produce confidence intervals for Rosenthal's fail-safe number. This was produced by discerning whether the number of studies analysed in a meta-analysis is fixed or random. Each case produces different variance estimators. For a given number of studies and a given distribution, we provided five variance estimators. Confidence intervals are examined with a normal approximation and a nonparametric bootstrap. The accuracy of the different confidence interval estimates was then tested by methods of simulation under different distributional assumptions. The <b>half</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> variance estimator has the best probability coverage. Finally, we provide a table of lower confidence intervals for Rosenthal's estimator.

40|$|In {{developing}} mechanistic PK–PD models, {{incidence of}} toxic responses {{in a population}} has to be described in relation to measures of biologically effective dose (BED). We have developed a simple dose-incidence model that links incidence with BED for compounds that cause toxicity by depleting critical cellular target molecules. The BED in this model was the proportion of target molecule adducted by the dose of toxic compound. Our modeling approach first estimated the proportion depleted for each dose and then calculated the tolerance distribution for toxicity in relation to either administered dose or log of administered dose. We first examined cases where {{the mean of the}} tolerance distribution for toxicity occurred when a significant proportion of target had been adducted (i. e., more than <b>half).</b> When a <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> was assumed to exist for the relationship of incidence and BED, the tolerance distribution based on administered dos...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I present a new single factor model for assets return {{observed}} in discrete time and its latent volatility {{with a common}} “market factor”. This model attempts to unify the concept of feedback effect and skewness in return distribution. Further, it generalizes existing stochastic volatility model with constant feedback to a framework with time varying feedback. As an immediate consequence dynamic skewness and leverage effect follows. However, the dynamic structure violates weakstationarity assumption usually considered for the heteroskedastic models for returns and hence the concept of bounded stationarity is introduced {{to address the issue}} of nonstationarity. The single factor model also helps to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated compared to existing SV models with separate feedback and skewness parameters. A characterization of the error distributions for returns and volatility is provided on the basis of existence of conditional moments. Finally, an application of the model has been explained with <b>Normal</b> error and <b>half</b> <b>Normal</b> market factor <b>distribution...</b>|$|R

40|$|Efficiency in {{agricultural}} production {{is indicative of}} the efficiency level of farm households in their farming activities. Farmers in developing countries do not make use of all the potential technological resources, thus making inefficient decisions in their agricultural activities. Herein, technical efficiency in relation with the production of three types of rice crop (Boro, Aus and Aman) was evaluated, with some determinants of technical efficiency identified, in Bangladesh. It was attempted, throughout this study, to access the status of technical efficiency in rice production in Bangladesh for panel data while using the Stochastic Frontier Production Model with either of truncated normal or half-normal distributional assumptions. Both time-variant and time-invariant inefficiency effects models were estimated, one at a time. Collected data from agricultural sector pertaining to three main rice crops in Bangladesh for the period of 1980 to 2008 were made used of throughout the study. The results revealed that technical efficiency gradually increased over the reference period with the <b>half</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> being found preferable to the truncated normal distribution as regards the technical inefficiency effects. The value of technical efficiency was found high for Boro rice while low for Aus in comparison with Aman rice in Bangladesh for both distributions in either of time-variant or invariant ones.
