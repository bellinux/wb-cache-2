5|$|After {{a medical}} exam, Mulder {{finds out that}} Orison has three times the bloodflow {{capacity}} of the brain due to a hole in he has drilled into his own head, allowing him to perform mental tricks by hypnotizing people. Orison hypnotizes the security guard in his room and easily escapes. Meanwhile, at Orison's apartment, a prostitute escapes when Pfaster attacks her for wearing a wig. Orison then finds Pfaster and takes him at gunpoint. In the woods, Orison digs a grave for Pfaster, who morphs into a demonic beast and kills him, burying him in his own shallow grave. Pfaster then calls the police, telling them where Orison is buried, and goes to Scully's house. He attacks Scully, who tells him {{that the only reason}} he was not given the death penalty was because she asked the judge for life. He overpowers her and locks her in her own closet. Mulder thinks something may be wrong when he hears the same song on his radio and calls Scully. After receiving no answer, he <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> her house and stumbles upon Pfaster, promptly arresting him. Meanwhile, Scully escapes from the closet and shoots Pfaster, despite him being unarmed, killing him. Scully later confides in Mulder, telling him she's scared because she's not sure who's in control of her, God or something else.|$|E
5|$|Amira and Anthony's {{relationship}} continues {{and after}} having a small argument with Christian Clarke (John Partridge), Amira <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Anthony's house and the pair end up having sex for the first time. However, she later cries afterwards and appears to regret it. She tells him it felt wrong, {{but it is not}} his fault. She then decides to leave Walford without telling him. Anthony later learns that Amira has left after Syed tells him. When Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) takes a liking to Anthony, her father Derek forces Anthony to take her out. Anthony is not interested in Alice, but is scared of Derek so cannot refuse. They have a couple of dates, but they go badly. Several weeks later, Alice receives flowers and assumes they are from Anthony. Anthony is then forced to take her out again, as {{he does not want to}} upset her. However, he tries to put her off by behaving and dressing badly. Later, during a game of spin the bottle, Anthony and Alice kiss, and he then decides that he really does like her and invites her on a proper date. Alice decides she is ready to lose her virginity to Anthony, although he does not pressure her. Her brother Joey (David Witts) overhears and manipulates Anthony into playing poker with Derek. Anthony cannot resist due to his gambling addiction and ends up losing the emporium. Both Derek and Joey tell him to leave and Alice is left stood up. Joey tells her Derek drove Anthony away, so she rushes to the emporium to find Anthony, but is too late as he leaves Walford via the tube station.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts off}} with a cable car looking over a large city (Barcelona, from the West looking East) while a German {{newscast}} featuring Alexander von Roon plays on TV and switches to a luxurious-looking hotel in Plaça de Catalunya with Elena Anaya taking off her sweater. It then cuts to Timberlake in a different room; then to a club scene and Timberlake {{in front of a}} white background. The video alternates between those four viewpoints, with Timberlake and Anaya seeming to be spies in the hotel room and strangers in the club. At a certain point, Timberlake <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Anaya's room by jumping over to her balcony. Then when Anaya goes to check it out, Timberlake traps and passionately has sex with her. In the club, it ends with Timberlake kissing Anaya in a bathroom stall. In the hotel room scene, Timberlake leaves by the same way he entered and moments later jumps to the next balcony before an explosion ensues. It ends with the figure of Anaya sitting in a chair beside a small television in which a kiss is frozen on the screen.|$|E

25|$|The {{action of}} SO+(1,3) on {{the points of}} N+ does not {{preserve}} the hyperplane S+, but acting on points in S+ and then rescaling so that the result is again in S+ gives an action of SO+(1,3) on the sphere which <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> an action on the complex variable ζ. In fact, this action is by fractional linear transformations, although this is not easily seen from this representation of the celestial sphere. Conversely, for any fractional linear transformation of ζ variable <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a unique Lorentz transformation on N+, possibly after a suitable (uniquely determined) rescaling.|$|E
25|$|The President, however, {{does not}} use these rights very often, having a largely {{ceremonial}} role. He or she is elected by Riigikogu, with two-thirds of the votes required. If the candidate does not gain the amount of votes required, the right to elect the President <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> an electoral body, consisting of the 101 members of Riigikogu and representatives from local councils. As in other spheres, Estonian law-making has been successfully integrated with the Information Age.|$|E
25|$|On {{the eve of}} the battle, Antony's {{soldiers}} hear strange portents, {{which they}} interpret as the god Hercules abandoning his protection of Antony. Furthermore, Enobarbus, Antony's long-serving lieutenant, deserts him and <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Octavius' side. Rather than confiscating Enobarbus' goods, which Enobarbus did not take with him when he fled, Antony orders them to be sent to Enobarbus. Enobarbus is so overwhelmed by Antony's generosity, and so ashamed of his own disloyalty, that he dies from a broken heart.|$|E

25|$|This high Mass is the norm; {{it is only}} in the {{complete}} rite with deacon and subdeacon that the ceremonies can be understood. Thus, the rubrics of the Ordinary of the Mass always suppose that the Mass is high. Low Mass, said by a priest alone with one server, is a shortened and simplified form of the same thing. Its ritual can be explained only by a reference to high Mass. For instance, the celebrant <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the north side of the altar to read the Gospel, because that is the side to which the deacon goes in procession at high Mass; he turns round always by the right, because at high Mass he should not turn his back to the deacon and so on.|$|E
25|$|Now {{expand the}} {{situation}} to have one sentient being observing the device. Now, they too enter the indefinite state. Their eyes, body, and brain are seeing both spins at the same time. The mind however, stochastically chooses one of the directions, {{and that is what}} the mind sees. When this observer <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the second detector, their body will see both results. Their mind will choose the result that agrees with the first detector, and the observer will see the expected results. However, the observers mind seeing one result does not directly affect the distant state - there is just no wave function in which the expected correlations do not exist. The true correlation only happens when they actually go over to the second detector.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{the troops}} types, {{it is unknown}} {{whether or not the}} Persian {{infantry}} engaged in the battle. It is most likely Cyrus and the cavalry he had escaped with from Media fought directly with the Median cavalry Astyages had sent to bring Cyrus back. Cyrus might have known he needed all his men when fighting Astyages's best cavalry, for when battle had started, Cyrus with his will and superior numbers had the advantage. Nicolas goes as far as to say Cyrus first displayed his bravery in this battle. Nevertheless, Cyrus's tactics proved successful in maintaining the war. In Herodotus' Histories, he hints the first battle between the Persians and Medes, which Harpagus <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Cyrus, and most of the Medes either joined Cyrus or were killed, with a small force escaping back to Media. This seems to go in accordance with Nicolaus' account of the first battle.|$|E

25|$|On March 26, 2007, Patrick and Robin {{argue over}} her {{decision}} to not move back into their apartment with him. She then <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Wyndemere to see Nikolas and asks if she can stay with him. Nikolas is not home at the time, and as she searches through his desk to find a paper to leave a note, she is stopped by Mr. Craig (Sebastian Roche), the head gunman from the Metro Court hostage crisis, and finds out he is blackmailing Nikolas for a new identity. When Nikolas returns home, he finds Robin tending to Craig's wound and finds out that Craig had decided Robin might be useful in his blackmail plot. Craig instructs Robin to go about her normal life and not {{to draw attention to}} herself. Also, she cannot not tell anybody—especially Patrick—and he makes numerous threats against Patrick to keep her in line. Robin goes about his instructions and gets into a fight with Patrick. On March 29, 2007, Patrick <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Wyndemere and demands that Nikolas tell him what is going on. Nikolas hesitates and Robin walks in. She can see Craig {{out of the corner of}} her eye, holding a gun. She fears for Patrick's safety, so she lies to him and tells him they are over. Later, Craig decides that a good cover story for Robin living at Wyndemere will be to have Robin and Nikolas play out a very public love affair. They agreed, fearing for their loved ones' lives. At the end of the day, Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) walks into Wyndemere, stopping dead in her tracks when she sees Robin and Nikolas in a very delicate position on the couch. The two brush it off as though it is nothing, but Alexis is clearly suspicious. Robin and Patrick are reunited following an almost deadly confrontation with Mr Craig. Once Nik is in the clear for good, Robin and Patrick go home together.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the wedding, Rani Kapoor (Coco Cherian) argues {{with her}} mother, Priya (Menik Gooneratne) about the dress she has to wear. At the church, Vanessa waits outside for Sonya and her son, Callum (Morgan Baker), who is giving his mother away. Inside, Toadie talks to the guests, then <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> sit with Lucas and claims that he should be used to getting married by now. The {{ceremony}} begins and Sonya and Toadie recite their vows. They exchange rings and are pronounced husband and wife. Everyone poses for photos and they head to Lassiter's for the reception. At the same time, Mason Turner (Taylor Glockner) and Robbo Slade (Aaron Jakubenko) are finalising plans to rob the hotel. At Lassiter's, Sonya struggles to find a signal on her phone and decides to walk around the corner. She finds two men with balaclavas on and overhears them mention the hotel has laid on extra security for a wedding. Robbo takes his balaclava off and notices Sonya when her phone rings again. Sonya notices the other man's distinctive belt buckle, before they run off.|$|E

She goes to Charlie's for a drink and Declan calls her and says that the {{situation}} with the money was down to a software glitch. Diana see Paul Robinson arrive and she <b>goes</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> him. Paul introduces her to Declan and Diana tells him that if there is any dirt to be found on Paul, she will find it. Paul later introduces Diana to his son, Andrew, and his wife, Rebecca. Rebecca invites Diana for dinner and Diana asks to meet Declan to discuss why he called her. Diana reveals to Declan that she knows that Paul has been embezzling money from the company. Andrew becomes jealous of Declan and Diana's bond and he gives Diana some of Paul's financial papers when he tells her about his business idea. Diana calls Rosemary Daniels and tells her that she has evidence of Paul's embezzlement. Rosemary asks Diana to keep her updated on the situation. Paul asks Diana to join him in taking over the company and to prove his loyalty, he goes to Diana's hotel room and sleeps with her. Diana hides a camera in the room and after Paul leaves she checks the tape, but finds Paul has wiped the footage. Diana tries to sabotage an event being held at Rebecca's bar, by taking all of the security for a conference at Lassiter's. Declan pleads with Diana to help his mother out, but Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) solves the problem instead.|$|E
