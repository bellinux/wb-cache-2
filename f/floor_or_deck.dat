60|$|Oh, well, and we {{have got}} ours in retaliation. Off and on, through all of yesterday, after the {{ventilator}} tragedy, there were noises beneath the cabin <b>floor</b> <b>or</b> <b>deck.</b> We heard them under the dining-table, under the steward's pantry, under Margaret's stateroom.|$|E
60|$|Or it is {{like the}} lodging-houses in Paris, turned upside down; the first <b>floor,</b> <b>or</b> <b>deck,</b> being rented by a lord; the second, by a select club of gentlemen; the third, by crowds of artisans; and the fourth, by a whole rabble of common people.|$|E
60|$|The poor mother, who, as {{the first}} mate reported, was a woman of good sense and good breeding, had spared all she could get so affectionately for her son, that at last she entirely sunk under it; and when the mate of our ship went in, she sat upon the <b>floor</b> <b>or</b> <b>deck,</b> with her back up against the sides, between two chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head sunk in between her shoulders, like a corpse, though not quite dead. My mate said all he could to revive and {{encourage}} her, and with a spoon put some broth into her mouth; she opened her lips, and lifted up one hand, but could not speak: yet she understood what he said, and made signs to him, intimating, {{that it was too}} late for her; but pointed to her child, as if she would have said, they should take care of him.|$|E

50|$|Fire barrier {{walls are}} {{typically}} continuous from an exterior wall to an exterior wall, <b>or</b> from a <b>floor</b> below to a <b>floor</b> <b>or</b> roof above, or from one fire barrier wall to another fire barrier wall, having a {{fire resistance rating}} {{equal to or greater}} than the required rating for the application. Fire barriers are continuous through concealed spaces (e.g., above a ceiling) to the <b>floor</b> <b>deck</b> <b>or</b> roof <b>deck</b> above the barrier. Fire partitions are not required to extend through concealed spaces if the construction assembly forming the bottom of the concealed space, such as the ceiling, has a fire resistance rating at least equal to or greater than the fire partition.|$|R

60|$|The {{sight of}} these people's {{distress}} was very moving to me, {{and brought to}} mind what I had a terrible respect of at my first coming on shore in my island, where I had not the least mouthful of food, or any hopes of procuring it; besides the hourly apprehension I had of being made the food of other creatures. But all the while the mate was thus relating to me the miserable condition of the ship's company, I could not put out of my thought the story {{he had told me}} of the three poor creatures in the great cabin; viz. the mother, her son, and the maid-servant, whom he had heard nothing of for two or three days; and whom he seemed to confess they had wholly neglected, their own extremities being so great; by which I understood that they had really given them no food at all; and that therefore they must be perished, and be all lying dead perhaps on the <b>floor</b> <b>or</b> <b>deck</b> of the cabin.|$|E
60|$|But {{now they}} were in a new danger; for they were afraid of eating too much, even of that little we gave them. The mate, or commander, brought six men with him in his boat; but these poor wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak that they could hardly sit to their oars. The mate himself was very ill, and half starved; for he {{declared}} he had reserved nothing from the men, and went share and share alike with them in every bit they ate. I cautioned him to eat sparingly, and set meat before him immediately, but he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he began to be sick and out of order; so he stopped a while, and our surgeon mixed him up something with some broth, which he said would be to him both food and physic; and after he had taken it he grew better. In the meantime I forgot not the men. I ordered victuals to be given them, and the poor creatures rather devoured than ate it: they were so exceedingly hungry that {{they were in a}} manner ravenous, and had no command of themselves; and two of them ate with so much greediness that they were in danger of their lives the next morning. The sight of these people's distress was very moving to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible prospect of at my first coming on shore in my island, where I had not the least mouthful of food, or any prospect of procuring any; besides the hourly apprehensions I had of being made the food of other creatures. But all the while the mate was thus relating to me the miserable condition of the ship's company, I could not put out of my thought the story he had told me of the three poor creatures in the great cabin, viz. the mother, her son, and the maid-servant, whom he had heard nothing of for two or three days, and whom, he seemed to confess, they had wholly neglected, their own extremities being so great; by which I understood that they had really given them no food at all, and that therefore they must be perished, and be all lying dead, perhaps, on the <b>floor</b> <b>or</b> <b>deck</b> of the cabin.|$|E
5000|$|A {{floating}} {{dry dock}} {{is a type}} of pontoon for dry docking ships, possessing floodable buoyancy chambers and a [...] "U"-shaped cross-section. The walls are used to give the dry dock stability when the <b>floor</b> <b>or</b> <b>deck</b> is {{below the surface of the}} water. When valves are opened, the chambers fill with water, causing the dry dock to float lower in the water. The deck becomes submerged and this allows a ship to be moved into position inside. When the water is pumped out of the chambers, the dry dock rises and the ship is lifted out of the water on the rising deck, allowing work to proceed on the ship's hull.|$|E
50|$|The main {{passenger}} area {{is on the}} second <b>floor</b> <b>or</b> main <b>deck.</b> There are three entrances on board, two on the main {{and one on the}} lower deck. Typically the president boards and deplanes from the front, main deck entrance via an airstair, while journalists and other passengers enter at the rear door of the main deck. Facilities for the press and other passengers are configured like an ordinary airliner's first-class cabin.|$|R
50|$|The T-beam {{has a big}} {{disadvantage}} {{compared to}} an -beam because it has no bottom flange with which to deal with tensile forces. One {{way to make a}} T-beam more efficient structurally is to use an inverted T-beam with a <b>floor</b> slab <b>or</b> bridge <b>deck</b> joining the tops of the beams. Done properly, the slab acts as the compression flange.|$|R

40|$|An {{elevator}} is {{a conveyor}} device or transport equipment that moves people <b>or</b> goods between <b>floors</b> <b>or</b> levels <b>or</b> <b>decks</b> of a building, vessel, or other structures. It {{has become a}} {{part and parcel of}} modern life in developed countries. The number of floors in high buildings, skyscrapers, and towers generate the usage of elevators. If it is simply assumed that each floor has at least two elevators in a thirty-floor building, people call the elevators in each floor even they are already occupied in weight and/or volume. When it is end of the daily work, thousand of homebound people wait at each floor and call the elevator {{to get out of the}} building and go their home. However, even the elevator is occupied in weight and volume, elevator stops at each floor in case of calling by the people. This causes people in elevator stop at each floor even their elevator is over-filled by the people. This is known as an annoying problem for the people who use elevators in their daily life. The idea is to control the elevators according to their both weight and volume not to stop them if they are already over-filled in weight and volume. Weight sensors already exist in most of the elevators. But there is no utilization concept of volume sensors in the elevators. Kids wagon can take huge space even their weight is less than the limiting weight of an elevator. Except human being, sometimes some accessories or boxes can be carried by the elevators. If there is no space in the elevator, it should not stop to accept new passengers but it could give a signal to the passengers beforehand that it is unable to elevate new stuffs. Actually, the weight and volume information of elevators can be monitored for the waiting passengers and they can be guided before they call the elevator. Additionally, elevator can be analyzed with a video camera (e. g., Microsoft Kinect) mounted to the ceiling of elevator with a depth sensor next to it. By dint of video camera and depth sensor integration, we have developed a system that automatically monitors elevator and warns the new passengers about the current status of elevation. The important functionalities of our system include: (a) The threshold for volume constraint is to be parameterized by the system; (b) The system automatically estimates the necessary and sufficient parameters and then makes a decision either the elevator is overfilled in volume or not based on the estimated parameters along with wight; and (c) It warns the passengers if the elevator is overfilled in volume. To work reliably and efficiently, the system examines the following attributes rightfully: (i) Volumetric capacity of the elevator; (i) Amount of occupied volume in the elevator; (iii) Amount of empty volume in the elevator; (iv) Height of the longest object in the elevator; and (v) Height of the shortest object in the elevator. By installing two cameras opposite to each other, we can monitor the above attributes and estimate the necessary and sufficient parameters by using video information. Based on the predefined volume and weight thresholds of a specific elevator, if either volume or weight will exceed their given thresholds and if the elevator will be called, then the elevator will not stop and give signal that it is unable to elevate new passengers...|$|R
