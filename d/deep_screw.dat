40|$|In {{order to}} fit {{prosthetic}} screws, mechanical drilling {{of the bone}} has been the norm since the development of modern surgery. However, bone reabsorption, hyperthermia and thermo necrosis could occur depending on the exposure time to the drill and elevated temperature in the surrounding bone due to friction and drill pressure. Non-contact ablation using a CO 2 laser can potentially increase {{the accuracy of the}} bone drilling and reduce the amount of friction applied to the bone, thus reducing the thermal effects on the surrounding tissue. A model of laser ablation of the human glenoid bone was done on COMSOL with a governing equation of transient state heat transfer from laser to bone. This heat transfer was then correlated to bone loss. According to previous studies, bone disintegration occurs at approximately 613 Kelvin. The bone’s geometry was simplified to a 2 -D axisymmetric cylinder. The two domains of the 5 mm <b>deep</b> <b>screw</b> region were also 2 D-axisymmetric cylinders with varying radius and depth. The phase field model was used {{to take into account the}} ablation process of bone. Because the bone essentially disintegrates into “gas-like” particles after reaching this temperature, the phase field model was used to determine the downward velocity of the “air-bone” interface. An adaptive mesh was also developed to move in conjunction with the moving interface. The laser pattern consisted of consecutive concentric cylindrical shells, with the first pulse at the center of the targeted ablated site and the following pulses were cylindrical shells of increasing area. However, because the radial scanning speed was extremely small compared to the pulse duration, concentric cylindrical shells were assumed to occur simultaneously, creating a constant area of laser ablation for each of the two screw domains. Because the CO 2 laser did not have a significant penetration depth as the heat generated by the laser was absorbed mainly at the bone surface, input laser heating was modeled as constant flux. Finally, the modeling results for laser ablation were compared to factors in mechanical bone drilling. By varying the input flux of the laser within a range of 300 W/cm 2 to 1200 W/cm 2 and measuring the total ablation time and the total damage in the surrounding tissue, an optimal flux range between 1050 W/cm 2 and 1100 W/cm 2 was found to minimize the end time (approximately 0. 55 seconds) and thermal damage to the surrounding bone (3. 5 mm 3). Compared to mechanical drilling, laser ablation with the optimized flux value was much faster than mechanical drilling which can drill at approximately 0. 33 mm per second. Generally, less surgery time decreases a patient’s risk when under anesthesia. An increased amount of thermal damage may also lead to refractures, loosening of the prosthetic and permanent loss of tissue function. As laser ablation minimized both these parameters, this model demonstrates that laser ablation of bone is a viable method to consider in future surgical orthopedic work...|$|E

The UK installation-accessory industry is therefore occasionally criticised for being overly conservative. As many modern types of electrical accessories (e.g., home automation control elements from non-UK manufacturers) are not available in BS 4662 format, other standard mounting boxes are increasingly used as well, such as those defined in DIN 49073-1 (60 mm diameter, 45 mm <b>deep,</b> fixing <b>screws</b> 60 mm apart) or, less commonly in the UK, ANSI/NEMA OS-1.|$|R

40|$|Objective: We {{describe}} a surgical tool {{that uses the}} distractor pin as a reference for determining proper screw length in ACDF. It is critical that screw purchase depth be as deep as possible without violating or penetrating the posterior cortical wall, which ensures strong pull out strength. Methods: We enrolled 81 adult patients who underwent ACDF using an anterior cervical plate from 2010 to 2012. Patients were categorized into Groups A (42 patients: retractor pin used as a reference for screw length) and B (39 patients: control group). Intraoperative lateral x-rays were taken after screwing the retractor pin to confirm the approaching vertebral level. The ratio of retractor pin length to body anteroposterior (A-P) diameter was measured as a reference. Proper screw length was determined by comparison to the reference. Results: The average distance from screw tip to posterior wall was 3. 0 ± 1. 4 mm in Group A and 4. 1 ± 2. 3 mm in Group B. The ratio of screw length to body sagittal diameter was 86. 2 ± 5. 7 % in Group A and 80. 8 ± 9. 0 % in Group B. Screw length to body sagittal diameter ratios higher than 4 / 5 occurred in 33 patients (90 %) in Group A and 23 patients (59 %) in Group B. No cases violated the posterior cortical wall. Conclusion: We introduce a useful surgical method for determining proper screw length in ACDF using the ratio of retractor pin length to body A-P diameter as a reference. This method allows for <b>deeper</b> <b>screw</b> purchase depth without violation of the posterior cortical wall...|$|R
50|$|ISO 1502 sets a {{standard}} for threads and gauging to test them. It establishes the attribute T as go for the major diameter and the attribute Z as no-go for the pitch diameter. The inspection tool has two threaded components. For example, there would be two female sections on a gauge to test a threaded male workpiece such as a screw. If the major diameter of a screw is too large, it will not fit in the T test thread at all (fail). If the major diameter is too small, the fit is sloppy (fail). If the thread has been cut too <b>deep,</b> it <b>screws</b> into the Z test thread (fail). If the fit is right and only does about three turns, the fit is right (pass).|$|R

In this work a theoretical relationship between uplift capacity and installation torque of <b>deep</b> helical <b>screw</b> piles in sand is proposed. The component of this relationship related to the contribution of helical plates to the uplift capacity was verified by centrifuge modelling in the Laboratoire Central des Ponts et Chaussées (Nantes). Twelve model piles with different number of helices and diameters were tested in reconstituted sand samples with different relative densities. The pile installation and pull-out tests were carried-out in flight. Direct shear interface tests were conducted to characterize the interface between soil and pile. The experimental results were compared with the values predicted by the suggested theoretical approach. This comparison showed good agreement between the measured and calculated uplift capacity...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} of fixed clinical orthodontics is the correction of <b>deep</b> overbite. Mini <b>screw</b> implants are ideally suited for absolute intrusion because they {{make it possible to}} apply light continuous forces of known magnitudes without producing any reciprocal reactionary effect on posterior teeth. The purpose of this FEM study was to evaluate and compare the stresses generated in maxillary anterior region during absolute en masse intrusion of six maxillary teeth using mini-implants at strategic locations. Materials and methods: Finite element model was generated using FEM software ANSYS and, on the same model, two different analyses were carried out for two groups with different points of force application as Group I consisted of two bilateral implants for en masse intrusion of maxillary anteriors and Group II consisted of a single mid implant. Results: Soft and hard bones showed significantly high stress distribution in Group I as compared to Group II. The total tooth deformation was found to be more with single point of force application which produced oblique force vectors. Conclusion: Stresses on the teeth are higher and distributed more evenly, when the point of force application is bilateral rather than a single source. Bilateral implants generate less stresses which are evenly distributed with minimum detrimental effect on the teeth during absolute intrusion...|$|R
