25|$|The DM also {{includes}} the ability to save partially complete DSN's, with code and logic to ask the user for any missing information at runtime. For instance, a DSN can be created without a required password. When an ODBC application attempts to connect to the DBMS using this DSN, the system will pause and ask the user to provide the password before continuing. This frees the application developer from having to create this sort of code, as well as having to know which questions to ask. All of this is included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> and the DSNs.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of ODBC, the drivers {{encapsulate}} many functions that {{can be broken down}} into several broad categories. One set of functions is primarily concerned with finding, connecting to and disconnecting from the DBMS that driver talks to. A second set is used to send SQL commands from the ODBC system to the DBMS, converting or interpreting any commands that are not supported internally. For instance, a DBMS that does not support cursors can emulate this functionality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b> Finally, another set of commands, mostly used internally, is used to convert data from the DBMS's internal formats to a set of standardized ODBC formats, which are based on the C language formats.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Jack Roush, {{owner of}} Roush Racing, offered Kvapil {{a seat in}} the No. 6 Ford F-150 in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. Kvapil {{replaced}} Mark Martin in the truck, who moved to Ginn Racing, and David Ragan, who was promoted to replace Martin in the No. 6 Ford in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Jack Roush, excited about signing with Kvapil, said, “We are pleased beyond measure {{that we were able to}} get a driver the caliber of Travis Kvapil. At only 30 years old with a Truck championship and two years of Sprint Cup experience under his belt, Travis brings great long and short term potential to and for Roush Racing.” He finished the season with four wins, three poles, eight Top 5's and 12 Top 10's. He finished the season sixth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> point standings. He returned to Roush Fenway Racing as a part-time driver in 2008 when Joey Clanton was released from the No. 09 Ford.|$|E
25|$|Ferrari's first 1966 car {{consisted}} of a 3.3-liter V12 engine that {{was taken from the}} Ferrari 275P2 sportscar prototypes, modified to 3000cc, and mounted in the back of an F1 chassis. The designation 312, which would be used for a number of later cars, indicated a 3-litre, 12-cylinder engine. The engine was rather heavy, and due to the reduced capacity, lower on power and especially torque. John Surtees drove this contraption unsuccessfully in Monaco while Lorenzo Bandini drove a Ferrari Dino 2.4-liter V6. Surtees won the second race, the 1966 Belgian Grand Prix, a track that favoured power with its long straights, but the 1964 champion departed after a row with manager Eugenio Dragoni. The issue was about priorities in racing, as Ferrari was under pressure from Ford in sports car racing, and the F1 effort was somewhat neglected. Mike Parkes replaced Surtees, who went to Cooper which used Maserati engines, to finish second <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> championship with a further win. For Ferrari, Ludovico Scarfiotti also won a race, the 1966 Italian Grand Prix at Monza which helped Ferrari finish second in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E

25|$|Bristol {{races are}} often {{the scene of the}} highest number of yellow-flag caution laps in the NASCAR season; with so many cars in such a small space, contact is almost inevitable. Until the Beneficiary Rule was instituted in 2004 (the rule was instituted after the races at Bristol in 2003), the short lap length and the {{unpredictable}} nature of the racing meant that {{this was one of the}} few remaining NASCAR tracks at which it was feasible for a driver to come back to win a race from several laps down; at most modern tracks, especially superspeedways, that was almost impossible. The short lap length also cuts the other way; any unscheduled pit stop for reasons such as a cut tire will result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> going two or more laps down as it is almost impossible to get anything done to a car during the time taken to complete one circuit, especially under green-flag conditions (approximately 15seconds). Thus, the disadvantage of losing laps means the chances of earning a free pass under the Beneficiary Rule is harder, since a driver losing two laps under a green-flag pit stop would have to race their way past the leader before the caution waved to regain one of their laps back, unless there are no cars one lap behind.|$|E
25|$|In the session's closing minutes, Nasr {{was on a}} fast lap {{and closed}} up to Johnny Cecotto Jr.'s slow car on the racing line while driving through the fourth corner and {{appeared}} to execute an sudden manoeuvre resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> gesticulating to Cecotto. The stewards deemed Nasr at fault and the driver was handed a three-grid penalty. As a result, Marciello, Arthur Pic and Lancaster rounded out the top ten. Leal was the fastest driver not to have received a penalty who was unable to qualify in the top ten; his best time of one minute and 39.588 seconds was 0.723 seconds off Palmer's pace. He was followed by Cecotto and Negrão {{in the next two}} spots. Rossi could not replicate his earlier form and could only muster a 15th place start. Kimiya Sato was 16th and was closely followed by René Binder and Daly. Regalia was restricted to starting 19th and Nathanaël Berthon completed the first twenty competitors. Trummer qualified in 21st position. He was followed by de Jong who spun under braking with cold tyres late in the session. Izaka was 23th and was joined on the grid's twelfth row by Adrian Quaife-Hobbs. 25th-place starter Axcil Jefferies lost control of his car's rear-end while drivers were getting their tyres to their optimum temperature at the session's start. Artem Markelov started {{from the back of the}} field after spinning on cold tyres which was caused by him running over the turn one kerb. He stalled his car and the session was red flagged to enable marshals to extract his vehicle from the racing line.|$|E
500|$|On 15 June 2013, Wizkid was {{involved}} in a non-life-threatening car accident along the Lekki-Epe Expressway in Lekki, Lagos. According to an article posted on Silverbird Television, Wizkid was hospitalised for a minor concussion resulting from the wreck. According to eyewitness reports compiled by MTV Base, Wizkid's Porsche Panamera was spotted speeding down the road; the car's front tires blew out and resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> of the vehicle losing control and crashing into a road barrier. Eyewitness reports also added that the car's airbag suspension system deployed on impact, shielding Wizkid and the driver instantaneously. At the time of the incident, Wizkid and other passengers in the car were returning from the Soundcity Nokia LumiaBeat Party. The accident allegedly occurred around 3:30am in front of the GET Arena. As a result of the wreck, the car was badly damaged. Pictures of the damaged vehicle surfaced on Instagram and Facebook. Vanguard reported that Wizkid acquired a Porsche Cayenne two weeks after the accident. He posted pictures of his new acquisition onto his Instagram page and tagged the pictures with the caption [...] "#Blessed".|$|E

2500|$|From 1982 to 1984, Tokyu Car built 45 of a heavily-specialized, meter-gauge RDC {{design for}} the Taiwan Railway Administration under license from Budd.

[...] To prevent dependency on the trailer's engine for cooling, the cooling fans of the driver cars are driven hydraulically instead of electrically. [...] This configuration results in each set producing 700HP for a top speed of 110km/h. [...] All 15 sets are still in service.|$|E
