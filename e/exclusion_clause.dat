5|$|Germanwings' {{parent company}} Lufthansa offered victims' {{families}} an initial aid payment {{of up to}} €50,000, separate from any legally-required compensation for the disaster. Elmar Giemulla, a professor of aviation law at the Technical University of Berlin quoted by the Rheinische Post, said he expected the airline would pay €10–30million in compensation. The Montreal Convention sets a per-victim cap of €143,000 in the event an airline is held liable, unless negligence can be proved. Insurance specialists said although co-pilot Andreas Lubitz hid a serious illness from his employer and deliberately crashed the passenger aircraft, these facts would not affect the issue of compensation nor be applicable to the <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause</b> in Lufthansa's insurance policy. Lufthansa's insurance company set aside US$300million (€280million) for financial compensation to victims' families and {{for the cost of}} the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The {{common law}} of privity of {{contract}} is a sub-rule of consideration because it restricts who can enforce an agreement {{to those who have}} brought consideration to the bargain. In an early case, Tweddle v Atkinson, it was held that because a son had not given any consideration for his father in law's promise to his father to pay the son £200, he could not enforce the promise. Given the principle that standing to enforce an obligation should reflect whoever has a legitimate interest in its performance, a 1996 report by the Law Commission entitled Privity of Contract: Contracts for the Benefit of Third Parties, recommended that while courts should be left free to develop the common law, some of the more glaring injustices should be removed. This led to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. Under section 1, a third party may enforce an agreement if it purports to confer a benefit on the third party, either individually or a member as a class, and there is no expressed stipulation that the person was not intended to be able to enforce it. In this respect there is a strong burden on the party claiming enforcement was not intended by a third party. A third party has the same remedies available as a person privy to an agreement, and can enforce both positive benefits, or limits on liability, such as an <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause.</b> The rights of a third party can then only be terminated or withdrawn without her consent if it is reasonably foreseeable that she would rely upon them.|$|E
500|$|The Act is {{designed}} to prevent the avoidance of implied terms through exclusion clauses. It provides (in Section 4) that any attempt to exclude a seller in consumer sales from Sections 2 and 3 is void. In non-consumer sales an <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause</b> is void [...] "to {{the extent that it}} is shown {{that it would not be}} fair or reasonable to allow reliance on the term". The burden of proof in such situations is on the party seeking to avoid liability through the <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause.</b> For determining whether it is [...] "fair or reasonable" [...] to allow the <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause,</b> five tests are used; 1) whether the parties were of equal bargaining strength, 2) whether the buyer was induced to agree to the clause, 3) whether the buyer knew, or ought to have known of the <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause,</b> 4) where the liability is conditional, if the condition is reasonable and 5) whether the goods were supplied as part of a special order. These basic tests were later extended into the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977.|$|E
500|$|Czarnikow v Roth, Schmidt & Co, the {{decision}} {{in which it was}} decided agreements excluding judicial supervision are invalid, is partially overruled by Sections 3 and 4. Section 3 provides that, where such an agreement is drafted, the High Court no longer has the automatic right to request additional reasons from the arbitrator or grant leave to appeal {{the decision}}. Such exclusion clauses must be specific, but can be general in nature; Section 3(2) states that it can be framed [...] "to relate to a particular award, to awards under a particular reference or to any other description of awards, whether arising out of the same reference or not". Section 3(6) provides an exception, which covers [...] "domestic" [...] arbitration agreements; these are defined as agreements where leave to appeal would not be valid in a jurisdiction outside the United Kingdom, and no parties are businesses or individuals legally based in the UK. In this situation, the <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause</b> is only valid if agreed to after the start of arbitration. A second exception is found in Section 4(1); where the contract arbitration is based on is within admiralty jurisdiction, to do with commodities trading, or an insurance agreement, it will not be valid unless either it was entered into after the start of arbitration or the law applicable to the contract is not that of England and Wales. In any situation, the High Court can be asked to give a decision on a point of law, or the <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause</b> removed, should all parties agree.|$|E

500|$|In Karsales (Harrow) Ltd v Wallis [...] 1 W.L.R. 936 {{the courts}} {{developed}} {{the doctrine of}} fundamental breach; if one party had breached the contract {{in such a way}} that, if there was no <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause,</b> it would void the contract, such a contract could be set aside. Although a step forward, this doctrine was problematic, as pointed out by Lord Reid in Suisse Atlantique Societe d'Armament SA v NV Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale [...] 1 AC 361; it failed to discriminate between exclusion clauses that were the result of unequal bargaining and those that were not. [...] In 1970 the England and Wales Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission produced their First Report on Exemption Clauses, designed to reform this area of law.

2500|$|After Derry v Peek it {{was thought}} that negligent {{misrepresentation}} was not actionable in tort. However, in Nocton v Lord Ashburton a claim was allowed where parties were in a fiduciary relationship and in Candler v Crane, Christmas and Co Denning LJ delivered a blistering dissent against the bar to recovery for negligent words. His dissent was approved in the leading case, Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd, where Heller & Partners Ltd (a bank) warranted to Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd (an advertising company) that its prospective client, Easipower Ltd, was creditworthy. When Easipower Ltd could not in fact pay for the advertising services, Hedley Byrne sued the bank for misrepresentation. This is a tort action, so the question did not actually involve a claim for misrepresentation inducing a contract. But the principle was the same. Could one sue for losses after being told negligent, rather than fraudulent, statements? The House of Lords answered [...] "yes" [...] if there was a special relationship between the parties showing that one had [...] "assumed responsibility" [...] to the other. In the instant case this would have worked, except that Heller & Partners had said in their warrant that they disclaimed any responsibility for their statement's accuracy. They had an <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause</b> (see below, and Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 3). So in absence of the <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause,</b> Heller & Partners would have been liable for negligent misstatement.|$|E

2500|$|Following a {{decision}} by European Union (EU) foreign ministers in December 2012 stating that [...] "all agreements between the state of Israel and the EU must unequivocally and explicitly indicate their inapplicability to the territories occupied by Israel in 1967," [...] the European Commission issued guidelines for the 2014 to 2020 financial framework covering all areas of co-operation between the EU and Israel, including economics, science, culture, sports and academia but excluding trade on 30 June 2013. According to the directive all future agreements between the EU and Israel must explicitly exclude Jewish settlements and Israeli institutions and bodies situated across the pre-1967 Green Line – including the Golan Heights, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. EU grants, funding, prizes or scholarships will only be granted if a settlement <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause</b> is included, forcing the Israeli government to concede in writing that settlements {{in the occupied territories}} are outside the state of Israel to secure agreements with the EU.|$|E
2500|$|The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 regulates clauses that exclude or limit terms {{implied by}} the common law or statute. Its general pattern is that if clauses {{restrict}} liability, particularly negligence, of one party, the clause must pass the [...] "reasonableness test" [...] in section 11 and Schedule 2. This looks at the ability of either party to get insurance, their bargaining power and their alternatives for supply, and a term's transparency. In places the Act goes further. Section 2(1) strikes down any term that would limit liability for a person's death or personal injury. Section 2(2) stipulates that any clause restricting liability for loss to property has to pass the [...] "reasonableness test". One of the first cases, George Mitchell Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd saw a farmer successfully claim that a clause limiting the liability of a cabbage seed seller to damages for replacement seed, rather than the far greater loss of profits after crop failure, was unreasonable. The sellers were {{in a better position}} to get insurance for the loss than the buyers. Under section 3 businesses cannot limit their liability for breach of contract if they are dealing with [...] "consumers", defined in section 12 as someone who is not dealing in the course of business with someone who is, or if they are using a written standard form contract, unless the term passes the reasonableness test. Section 6 states the implied terms of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 cannot be limited unless reasonable. If one party is a [...] "consumer" [...] then the SGA 1979 terms become compulsory under the CRA 2015. In other words, a business can never sell a consumer goods that do not work, even if the consumer signed a document with full knowledge of the <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause.</b> Under section 13, it is added that variations on straightforward exemption clauses will still count as exemption clauses caught by the Act. So for example, in Smith v Eric S Bush the House of Lords held that a surveyor's term limiting liability for negligence was ineffective, after the chimney came crashing through Mr Smith's roof. The surveyor could get insurance more easily than Mr Smith. Even though there was no contract between them, because section 1(1)(b) applies to any notice excluding liability for negligence, and even though the surveyor's <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause</b> might prevent a duty of care arising at common law, section 13 [...] "catches" [...] it if liability would exist [...] "but for" [...] the notice excluding liability: then the exclusion is potentially unfair.|$|E

2500|$|The 1999 Act's reforms mean {{a number}} of old cases would be decided {{differently}} today. In Beswick v Beswick while the House of Lords held that Mrs Beswick could specifically enforce a promise of her nephew to her deceased husband to pay her £5 weekly in her capacity as administratrix of the will, the 1999 Act would also allow her to claim as a third party. In Scruttons Ltd v Midland Silicones Ltd {{it would have been}} possible for a stevedore firm to claim the benefit of a limitation clause in a contract between a carrier and the owner of a damaged drum of chemicals. Lord Denning dissented, arguing for abolition of the rule, and Lord Reid gave an opinion that if a bill of lading expressly conferred the benefit of a limitation on the stevedores, the stevedores give authority to the carrier to do that, and [...] "difficulties about consideration moving from the stevedore were overcome" [...] then the stevedores could benefit. In The Eurymedon, Lord Reid's inventive solution was applied where some stevedores similarly wanted the benefit of an <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause</b> after dropping a drilling machine, the consideration being found as the stevedores performing their pre-existing contractual duty {{for the benefit of the}} third party (the drilling machine owner). Now none of this considerably technical analysis is required, given that any contract purporting to confer a benefit on a third party may in principle be enforced by the third party.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 the EU {{adopted a}} binding {{directive}} {{according to which}} the Israeli government {{will be required to}} state in any future agreements with the EU that settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem are outside the state of Israel. The directive partially implements an earlier EU foreign ministers' declaration [...] that [...] "all agreements between the state of Israel and the EU must unequivocally and explicitly indicate their inapplicability to the territories occupied by Israel in 1967". The guidelines prohibit the issuing of EU grants, funding, prizes or scholarships to Israeli entities unless a settlement <b>exclusion</b> <b>clause</b> is included. Israeli institutions and bodies situated across the pre-1967 Green Line will be automatically ineligible. The EU directive is similar to the one signed between the United States and Israel in 1972 whereby Israel undertook, in exchange for science funding, to restrict the projects within the 1967 borders. The guidelines do not restrict grants issued by individual EU member states. In advance of the publication of the Guidelines, there was, in Israel, a political and media storm. News Media have suggested Israel will take some action against the EU. Maja Kocijancic, spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, has said: [...] "The EU is concerned by reports in the Israeli media that the Israeli Minister of Defense has announced a number of restrictions affecting EU activities supporting the Palestinian people. We have not received any official communication from the Israeli authorities. Our delegations on the spot are seeking urgent clarifications".|$|E
