25|$|The {{development}} of football {{on a national}} level in Cape Verde is hindered by several factors, including local definitions of femininity that discourage participation in sport, lack of adequate training, a lack of competitive spirit in matches and during training. There is also a lack of available players, with participation rates having peaked at roughly 350 a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>back</b> to roughly 200 current players. The lack of opportunities to go further with football inside the country also discourages continued participation in the sport.|$|E

In an {{introductory}} voiceover, Cook explains his thoughts and alludes towards a murder he may have committed; it is implied but not outright stated that he is avoiding capture after killing John Foster a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>back.</b> He is now a drug dealer and has a semi-serious relationship with a woman named Emma (Esther Smith), but becomes mesmerised by Charlie (Hannah Britland), the girlfriend of local drug lord Louis (Liam Boyle) after he is asked to watch over her for a few days. After Louis brutally kills a man named Jason (Lucien Laviscount) for having an affair with Charlie, Cook flees Manchester, taking Emma with him.

500|$|Spotnitz {{called the}} episode a [...] "wonderful mind game" [...] but {{was worried that}} the {{convoluted}} story and pace would confuse the viewer. In order to placate these concerns, the teleplay was assigned to be finalized by John Shiban and Vince Gilligan. Once the script was finished, Spotnitz felt the story had become much more understandable; he was particularly pleased with the way Shiban and Gilligan showed Mulder and Scully stepping on the mushrooms {{as a way to}} subtly cue their initial exposure to the hallucinogenic mushroom. Gilligan noted that [...] "another really important thing we did was making sure that the audience didn't think that Mulder and Scully weren't really in jeopardy—that it was all a dream, like that whole season of Dallas a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>back.</b> That's why we made sure they realized that the goo from the mushroom would kill them".|$|E
500|$|Billboard {{delivered}} a favorable review: [...] "Unusual pairing of artist and producer here as Booker T. Jones was the prime mover in Booker T & the MGs a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>back.</b> But the combination works well [...] (Nelson) puts his distinctive, soft vocal style {{to good use}} interpreting a number of standards as well as country-flavored tunes. All of the material seems well suited to his easygoing style as Nelson backs himself with guitar and gets help with guitar, drums, keyboards, bass and harmonica". Texas Monthly also favored the album, but noted the difference with previous Nelson recordings: [...] "Stardust blends the stark economy of Red Headed Stranger with an underlying current of church spiritualism. More often than not it works. Though the selections are all at least twenty years old, the songs withstand the test of time. Occasionally Willie's voice seems to crack, I do miss the more familiar hard-bitten whine that accompanies his usual fare like [...] "Whiskey River". But nonetheless this is a sterling effort".|$|E

Jeevan Brar of TV Buzz noted the popularity that Chloe and Billy (a couple that fans have named [...] "Chilly") generated, writing, [...] "A lot of fans saw that pairing end way too quickly {{to make way for}} the ill-fated Billy & Mac redux." [...] Referring to the love triangle between Chance, Chloe and Heather, Nekeeta Borden (also writing for Zap2it) said, [...] "All things considered, will Chance and Chloe survive Hurricane Heather?" [...] In another article, Borden heavily criticized the writing for Chloe's character. She wrote, [...] "Initially I hated the pint-sized minx when she first planted her stilettos in Genoa City and on Lily’s face a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>back,</b> but lately I've come to realize how much I miss the scheming, sassy Chloe of old [...] The pairing with [...] killed poor Chloe dead. She, like Phyllis Newman (Michelle Stafford), is not meant to be some happy housewife, married to a boy scout. Chloe needs a sparring partner and partner-in-crime. She is way too much woman to be cheated on by someone like Chance." [...] Also unfavorable of the relationship was Sara Bibel of Xfinity, who wrote that [...] "Chance and Chloe never had much chemistry. [...] She was attracted to him because she thought he was a safe, dependable guy who would not cheat on her", describing Chance as [...] "the anti-Billy" [...] in Chloe's eyes.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Times, {{journalist}} David Chater highlighted The Most Hated Family in America among selections for [...] "Chater's Choice". Chater commented, [...] "Louis Theroux [...] undertakes his ugliest {{assignment to}} date." [...] Chater concluded, [...] "Theroux deploys all his logic and charm {{to find the}} humanity beneath the rhetoric, but ultimately fails. It is difficult to reason with {{people who think that}} holding up a placard proclaiming 'Jews worship the rectum' is 'a courteous and loving' thing to do." [...] The film was highlighted in the Liverpool Echo as [...] "Sunday's: Pick of the day". Peter Grant of the Liverpool Echo commented, [...] "Louis Theroux took a trip to Kansas for his documentary, The Most Hated Family in America. His profile of Westboro Baptist Church, the home of America's most fanatical Christian fundamentalists, was astonishing." [...] Karl French of Financial Times selected the film as his [...] "Critic's Choice". French wrote positively of the documentary, [...] "After painting himself into an oddball- documentary corner a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>back,</b> Theroux wisely took a long break, and he's come back refreshed, as confirmed by this film. In the way it reveals the comic horror inherent in all forms of zealotry, it is every bit as compelling as Theroux's recent Vegas documentary." [...] The Mail on Sunday critic Tom Cox rated the documentary as four out of four stars. Cox wrote of Theroux, [...] "His attempts to challenge the beliefs of the Phelps clan – a 71-strong congregation who picket military funerals with 'America Is Doomed' signs – and fuddle them with good nature and erudition were impressive, but ultimately as futile as an attempt to teach a cat algebra." ...|$|E
500|$|For her {{portrayal}} of Valene, Van Ark received two Soap Opera Digest awards {{in the category}} [...] "Outstanding Actress in a Leading Role on a Prime Time Serial". Greg Hernandez said, [...] "Before I go on, I have to confess that I was a die-hard fan of Knots Landing, the series on which Joan played sweet Valene Ewing for 14 years. Her character of Valene was a best-selling author but her personal life was always a mess. She had her husband, Gary, stolen by another woman then got pregnant by him, her twin babies were kidnapped by a crooked doctor, she was given a drug overdose at gunpoint by her ex-husband's fiancee, and she racked up enough marriages to give Elizabeth Taylor a run for her money. But she and Gary Ewing (Ted Shackleford) made for one of television's most beloved couples and the audience never stopped rooting {{for them to get}} back together. Joan keeps in touch with Ted (pictured with Joan, above at a [...] "Knots" [...] reunion a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>back),</b> Michelle Lee - who played her best friend Karen - and the great stage star Julie Harris who played her mother." [...] Knots Landing itself has experienced a tremendous fan following and dedication. Van Ark said of this, [...] "It’s amazing. It’s like having friends everywhere in the United States. I heard that a group a fans from London were coming in just to see us at this (autograph convention). We get a lot of fan mail from Europe – France, Germany, Russia. Knots has a huge following, and I think fans of the show are loving and loyal. Not many shows last 14 years on prime-time. That’s a milestone, and I’m very proud of it." ...|$|E
