5|$|Periyar {{claimed that}} Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada {{came from the}} same mother {{language}} of Old Tamil. He explained that the Tamil language is called by <b>four</b> <b>different</b> names since it is spoken in <b>four</b> <b>different</b> Dravidian states. Nevertheless, current understanding of Dravidian languages contains statements contradicting such claims. For example, the currently known classification of Dravidian languages provides the following distinct classes: Southern (including Tamil–Kannada (Malayalam) and Tulu); Central (including Telugu–Kui and Kolami–Parji); and, Northern (including Kurukh–Malto and Brahui). Additionally, statements on the presence of evidence for linking Dravidian languages and Indo-European languages are available.|$|E
