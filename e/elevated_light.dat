25|$|In general {{ceramics}} {{are typically}} inert {{and are not}} sensitive to <b>elevated</b> <b>light</b> levels. However, extreme changes in temperature and humidity can cause chemical and physical damage. Typically museums strive to store ceramics, {{as well as many}} other material types, in a stable temperature of 68°F with ± 3°. Additionally relative humidity should be stabilized at 50% also with a ±5%. Storing objects near windows, heaters, fireplaces, and exterior walls can create an unstable environment with temperature and humidity fluctuation and increase potential for damages.|$|E

25|$|Clades B and C {{are found}} more {{frequently}} in the deeper water regions, which may explain the higher susceptibility to increased temperatures. Terrestrial plants that receive less sunlight because they {{are found in the}} undergrowth can be analogized to clades B, C, and D. Since clades B through D are found at deeper depths, they require an <b>elevated</b> <b>light</b> absorption rate to be able to synthesize as much energy. With elevated absorption rates at UV wavelengths, the deeper occurring phylotypes are more prone to coral bleaching versus the more shallow clades. Clade D has been observed to be high temperature-tolerant, and as a result it has a higher rate of survival than clades B and C.|$|E
500|$|During his 2010 mayoralty campaign, Rob Ford {{denounced the}} idea of light rail transit and instead {{proposed}} to replace the Scarborough RT with {{an extension of the}} Bloor–Danforth line. However, on March 31, 2011, Ford agreed with the provincial government that the province's Metrolinx agency would replace the Scarborough RT with an <b>elevated</b> <b>light</b> rail line as part of a proposed [...] "Eglinton-Scarborough Crosstown line" [...] instead.

It is a mixed system consisting of three heavy rail lines operating predominantly underground and one <b>elevated</b> <b>light</b> metro line, collectively encompassing 69 stations and [...] of track. Since 1954, when the TTC opened Canada's first underground rail line then known as the Yonge subway, under Yonge Street between the existing Union railway station and Eglinton Avenue with 12 stations.

2500|$|At {{the highest}} degree of separation, it can be {{difficult}} to draw the line between light rail and metros, as in the case of Wuppertal's Schwebebahn hanging rail system, the [...] "D" [...] Branch of Boston's Green Line, or London's Docklands Light Railway, which would likely not be considered [...] "light" [...] were it not for the contrast between it and the London Underground. These may be considered to be light metro lines rather than [...] "light rail" [...] lines. In Europe, however, the term light rail is increasingly used to describe any rapid transit system with a fairly low frequency or short trains compared to heavier mass rapid systems such as the London Underground or Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit. For instance, the LRT-1 and MRT-3 in Manila are often referred to as [...] "light rail", despite being fully segregated, mostly elevated railways. This phenomenon is quite common in Chinese cities, where <b>elevated</b> <b>light</b> metro lines in Shanghai, Wuhan, and Dalian are called light rail lines.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that seafarers probably provided the first observational evidence that the Earth was not flat, based on observations of the horizon. This argument was put forward by the geographer Strabo (c.64BC– 24AD), who suggested that the spherical shape of the Earth was probably known to seafarers around the Mediterranean Sea since at least the time of Homer, citing a line from the Odyssey as indicating that the poet Homer knew of this as early as the 7th or 8th century BC. Strabo cited various phenomena observed at sea as suggesting that the Earth was spherical. He observed that <b>elevated</b> <b>lights</b> or areas of land were visible to sailors at greater distances than those less elevated, and stated that the curvature of the sea was obviously responsible for this.|$|R
2500|$|Metromover is a free, {{automated}} {{people mover}} (automated guideway transit) system, similar to an <b>elevated</b> <b>light</b> rail, that operates on three loops totaling [...] of elevated track and 21 {{stations in the}} Central Business District, [...] "Omni", and Brickell. The main Inner Loop opened in 1986, and the Omni (north) and Brickell (south) extensions opened in 1994. The Metromover gained popularity significantly when the 25-cent fare was lifted in 2002. Since then it has been free to ride. Metromover is used heavily by those who live, work, or attend events in downtown, with ridership doubling from 2002 to 2014, {{as well as by}} tourists staying in downtown to get to attractions or just to get a free tour of the downtown cityscape. It is also used by those who commute into the city using Metrorail and Tri-Rail. Metrorail and Metromover are connected at the Government Center and Brickell stations, and even by construction workers commuting to downtown-area projects. Tri-Rail and Metrorail are connected at the Tri-Rail and Metrorail transfer station. Metromover headways vary from about two to five minutes depending on loop and overlap.|$|E

40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [41076049, 41276077]Combined {{effects of}} {{intertidal}} elevation and light level on two-month-old seedlings of Avicennia marina were studied at Zengying, Xiamen of China. Leaf number, {{area and thickness}} were promoted by decreasing elevation or <b>elevating</b> <b>light</b> level. Stem height differed little between light levels but was significantly stimulated by moderate waterlogging. Expansion of stem basal diameter was promoted by high light level but not affected by elevation. Total biomass showed highest at the middle elevation and was promoted by high light level. Seedlings in the gaps generally had higher root weight ratio (RWR) and stem weight ratio (SWR) but lower leaf weight ratio (LWR) than those under the canopy. Leaf pigment contents in the gaps were significantly stimulated by low elevations, while a reverse tendency occurred under the canopy. Both roots and leaves increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities to defend prolonged waterlogging. High light level resulted in high SOD and POD activities in roots but not in leaves. Malonaldehyde (MDA) contents changed little between light levels but were significantly promoted by prolonged waterlogging. These growth and physiological responses suggested that A. marina seedlings had strong tolerance to prolonged waterlogging but not to canopy shade. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
