Research,questionnaires have {{demonstrated}} that <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> candidates often have difficulty adapting {{to the use of}} <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> satisfactorily (Kasten & Miller, 1981; Tyler & Baker, 1983). Until recently, <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> <b>dispensers</b> tried to solve this problem by improving the method for choosing appropriate <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> (Tobias, 1982). The literature. however, indicates this has not solved the problem Sorri, Luotonen & Laitakari, 1984). A <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> <b>dispenser</b> can often subjectively identify candidates who will have difficulty adjusting. These candidates could perhaps be identified earlier with objective methods. Once identified, steps could be taken to help the candidates. adjust more easily to their <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> (Brooks, 1981). Such objective methods have not yet been established. Interviews or questionnaires are typical formats for communication handicap scales. The purpose of the scales is to rate the degree of communication handicap caused by the hearing loss (Aipiner, 1982). Some researchers have suggested that these scales can be used to objectively predict ability to adapt to <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> use (Hasten & Miller, 1981). Alpiner (1982) has suggested the McCarthy-Alpiner Scale (McCarthy & Alpiner, 1980) and the Sanders Profile Questionnaire (Sanders, 1975) be used for research, however, has defined the predictive nature of any communication handicap scale.

40|$|Abstract Background Because of the {{increasing}} costs and anticipated shortage of Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) specialists in the care for hearing-impaired persons, an integrated care pathway that includes direct <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> provision was developed. While this direct pathway is still under investigation, in a survey we examined expectations and potential barriers and facilitators towards this direct pathway, of patients and professionals involved in the pathway. Methods Two study populations were assessed: members of the health professions involved in the care pathway for hearing-impaired persons (general practitioners (GPs), <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> <b>dispensers,</b> ENT-specialists and clinical audiologists) and persons with hearing complaints. We developed a comprehensive semi-structured questionnaire for the professionals, regarding expectations, barriers, facilitators and conditions for implementation. We developed two questionnaires for persons with hearing complaints, both regarding evaluations and preferences, and administered them after they had experienced two key elements of the direct pathway: the triage and the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> fitting. Results On average GPs and <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> <b>dispensers</b> had positive expectations towards the direct pathway, while ENT-specialists and clinical audiologists had negative expectations. Professionals stated both barriers and facilitators towards the direct pathway. Most professionals either supported implementation of the direct pathway, provided {{that a number of}} conditions were satisfied, or did not support implementation, unless roughly the same conditions were satisfied. Professionals generally agreed on which conditions need to be satisfied. Persons with hearing complaints evaluated the present referral pathway and the new direct pathway equally. Many, especially older, participants stated however that they would still visit the GP and ENT-specialist, even when this would not be necessary for reimbursement of the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid,</b> and found it important that the ENT-specialist or Audiological Centre evaluated their <b>hearing</b> <b>aid.</b> Conclusion This study identified professional concerns about the direct pathway for hearing-impaired persons. Gaps exist in expectations amongst professions. Also gaps exist between users of the pathway, especially between age groups and regions. Professionals are united in the conditions that need to be fulfilled for a successful implementation of the direct pathway. Implementation on a regional level is recommended to best satisfy these conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Loudness {{is one of}} the {{key factors}} related to overall {{satisfaction}} with <b>hearing</b> <b>aids.</b> Individual loudness functions can reliably be measured using categorical loudness scaling (CLS) without any training. Nevertheless, the use of loudness measurement like CLS is by far less common than use of audiometric thresholds to fit <b>hearing</b> <b>aids,</b> although loudness complaints are one of the most mentioned reasons for revisiting the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> <b>dispenser.</b> A possible reason is that loudness measurements are typically conducted with monaural narrow-band signals while binaural broad-band signals as speech or environmental sounds are typical in daily life. This study investigated individual uncomfortable loudness levels (UCL) with a focus on monaural and binaural broad-band signals, as being more realistic compared to monaural narrow-band signals. Nine normal-hearing listeners served as a reference in this experiment. Six hearing-impaired listeners with similar audiograms were aided with a simulated <b>hearing</b> <b>aid,</b> adjusted to compensate the narrow-band loudness perception back to normal. As desired, monaural narrow-band UCLs were restored to normal, however large individual deviations of more than 30 dB were found for the binaural broad-band signal. Results suggest that broad-band and binaural loudness measurements add key information about the individual hearing loss beyond the audiogram...|$|R
30|$|Modern digital <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> contain {{advanced}} {{signal processing}} algorithms with many tuning parameters. These {{are set to}} values that ideally match the needs and preferences of the user. Because of the large dimensionality of the parameter space and unknown determinants of user satisfaction, the tuning procedure becomes a complex task. Some of the tuning parameters are set by the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> <b>dispenser</b> based {{on the nature of}} the hearing loss. Other parameters may be tuned on the basis of the models for loudness perception, for example [1]. But, not every individual user preference can be put into the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> beforehand because some particularities of the user may be hard to represent into the algorithm, and the user's typical acoustic environments may be very different from the sounds that are played to the user in a clinical fitting session. Moreover, sound preferences may be changing with continued wear of a <b>hearing</b> <b>aid.</b> Thus, users sometimes return to the clinic soon after the initial fitting for further adjustment [2]. In order to cope with the various problems for tuning parameters prior to device usage, we present in this paper a method to personalize the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> algorithm during usage to actual user preferences.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to mine a large set of heterogeneous audiology data to create a decision support system (DSS) to choose between two <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> types (ITE and BTE aid). This research is based on the data analysis of audiology data using various statistical and data mining techniques. It uses the data of a large NHS (National Health Services, UK) facility. It uses 180, 000 records (covering more than 23, 000 different patients) from a <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> clinic. The developed system uses an unconventional method to predict <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> type for a patient and it {{can be used as a}} second opinion by audiologists for complex cases. After modifying the system to take account of the feedback from a professional audiologist, the success rates obtained were in the ranges 63 to 66 percent. In this research an automatic system was developed to choose between an ITE or a BTE <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> type with an explanation facility that can be used as a second opinion by audiologist in cases where the choice of an ITE or a BTE <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> is not clear cut. This analysis of audiology data and DSS will provide supplementary information for audiology experts and <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> <b>dispensers.</b> This type of system may also be of interest to manufacturers of hearing technologies in using as a ready means for their telephone customer services staff to check data, discovering data in audiology records will also be good for general awareness about the suitability of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> type...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the predictors of entering a <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> evaluation period (HAEP) using a prospective design drawing on the health belief model and the transtheoretical model. In total, 377 older persons who presented with hearing problems to an ENT-specialist (n = 110) or a <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> <b>dispenser</b> (n = 267) filled in a baseline questionnaire. After four months, it was determined via a telephone interview whether or not participants had decided to enter a HAEP. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied to determine which baseline variables predicted HAEP status. A priori, candidate predictors were divided into ‘likely’ and ‘novel’ predictors based on the literature. The following variables {{turned out to be}} significant predictors: more expected <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> benefits, greater social pressure, and greater self-reported hearing disability. In addition, greater hearing loss severity and stigma were predictors in women but not in men. Of note, the predictive effect of self-reported hearing disability was modified by readiness such that with higher readiness, the positive predictive effect became stronger. None of the ‘novel’ predictors added significant predictive value. The results support the notion that predictors of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> uptake are also predictive of entering a HAEP. This study shows that some of these predictors appear to be gender-specific or are dependent on a person’s readiness for change. After assuring the external validity of the predictors, an important next step would be to develop prediction rules for use in clinical practice, so that older persons’ hearing help seeking journey can be facilitated...|$|R
40|$|Instructional {{design is}} a science that has {{received}} little attention from residential universities and educational practices. Instructional design {{is regarded as a}} prerequisite for designing, delivering and optimising flexi-learning programmes and {{should be part of the}} curricularising processes of universities. There is furthermore an increasing awareness, both internationally and nationally, of the need for distance education. The paradigm shift towards more learner centred study, independent of time and place, necessitates the redesigning and development of learning material at tertiary institutions. This study applies the parameters of instructional design and distance teaching to the field of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> acoustics. The stages utilised in the instructional design of a distance teaching program for <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> acousticians were the following: planning through an analysis of the situation, design and development of the program, implementing the postgraduate Diploma in <b>Hearing</b> <b>Aid</b> Acoustics and the utilisation and management of the program through continuous assessment of the program. In the planning phase an analysis of the situation was conducted by means of questionnaires to the major role players, viz. <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> <b>dispensers</b> in practice and their adult and geriatric clients with a hearing loss. A total of 144 respondents were included in the study. In the planning document the expected outcomes and main traits of the potential learners were identified. The best system for the delivery of the program was also selected. The results of the analysis phase were used to develop and implement a two year post-graduate distance teaching diploma in <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> acoustics. A major challenge was to effectively facilitate the practical skills required of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> acousticians within a distance teaching program. Selected contact periods are therefore used for practising practical skills. In the final phase of instructional design, the program was evaluated. It was indicated that instructional design is indeed a prerequisite for specifying conditions for learning, based on sound teaching principles.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} was to describe the speech intelligibility in noise test results among Dutch teenagers and young adults aged 12 – 24 years, using a national online speech reception threshold (SRT) test, the Earcheck. A secondary {{objective was}} to assess the effect of age and gender on speech intelligibility in noise. Design: Cross-sectional SRT data were collected over a 5 -year period (2010 – 2014), from participants of Earcheck. Regression analyses were performed, with SRT as the dependent variable, and age and gender as explaining variables. To cross-validate the model, data from 12 - to 24 -year olds from the same test distributed by a <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> <b>dispenser</b> (Hoorscan) were used. Results: In total, 96, 803 valid test results were analyzed. The mean SRT score was − 18. 3 [*]dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (standard deviation (SD) [*]=[*] 3. 7). Twenty-five percent of the scores was rated as insufficient or poor. SRT performance significantly improved with increasing age for teenagers aged 12 – 18 years by 0. 49 [*]dB SNR per age-year. A smaller age-effect (0. 09 [*]dB SNR per age-year) was found for young adults aged 19 – 24 years. Small differences between male and female users were found. Conclusion: Earcheck generated large quantities of national SRT data. The data implied that a substantial number of users of Earcheck may have some difficulty in understanding speech in noise. Furthermore, {{the results of this study}} showed an effect of gender and age on SRT performance, suggesting an ongoing maturation of speech-in-noise performance into late adolescence.

40|$|Objective: Although {{clinician}} administered surveys evaluating <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> handling skills exist, {{the development}} of a self-administered version may reduce clinical load, save consultation time, and facilitate more frequent use than face-to-face consultations allow. However, there is currently no evidence to support whether <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> owners can accurately self-report <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> handling skills via self-report survey that systematically evaluates the ability to accurately perform the individual aspects of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> handling required for effective <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> management. Design: An explorative pilot study using a prospective research design. Study sample: Nineteen adult <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> owners, aged between 65 and 93 years. Results: The self-administered survey demonstrated high sensitivity when compared with clinician evaluation of skills, with 93 % of participants accurately self-identifying and reporting whether <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> handling skill training was required. Conclusions: <b>Hearing</b> <b>aid</b> owners are able to accurately self-report <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> handling difficulties when provided with an itemised list of skills...|$|R

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{estimated}} in overseas studies that between 1 % and 40 % of <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> dispensed are not used (Dillon et al, 1999; Kochkin, 2005; Lupsakko & Kautiainen, 2005; Parving & Sibelle, 2001; Smeeth et al, 2002; Stark & Hickson, 2004). <b>Hearing</b> <b>aid</b> non-use has not been evaluated in the New Zealand context, so it is {{the aim of this}} study to determine the rate of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> non-use in New Zealand and to investigate factors that may predict whether <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> adopters go on to be successful <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> users. Methods: Participants engaged in a phone interview that was conducted to investigate factors affecting <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> use. The interview questions were related to the Health Belief Model and thus focused on perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived barriers, perceived benefits and self-efficacy of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> use. Descriptive qualitative analysis was then applied to analyse themes from the interviews. Results: Ten barriers and nine facilitators to <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> use in New Zealand were found. Perceived severity and self-efficacy were also studied in relation to <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> use. It was found that perceived severity did affect <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> use, with those who perceive their hearing severity to be worse, wearing their <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> more than those who perceive no or little hearing difficulty. Whereas self-efficacy of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> management did not have a significant relationship with <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> use. Conclusion: The results from this study highlight reasons why <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> adopters become successful or unsuccessful <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> users. It is hoped clinicians will be able to provide additional support to those who are considered unsuccessful users or at risk of becoming an unsuccessful user...|$|R
