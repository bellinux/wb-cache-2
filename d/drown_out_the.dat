5|$|Due to {{the quick}} {{shooting}} schedule, the rain forced several exterior scenes to be re-written to be shot inside. Other scenes were shot with a large tarp draped over the actors. Due {{to the fact that}} the rainfall was audible in the background, Corman used the film's score and an assortment of sound effects to <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> noise. The first scene shot was Beverly Garland and John Ireland's love scene in a tree. The tree was home to a colony of red ants, who crawled all over the actors and repeatedly bit them.|$|E
5|$|However, {{without the}} ability to {{effectively}} track weak laser signals, collection of atmospheric data would be relegated to times of day where the sun's electromagnetic emissions did not <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> laser's signal. The addition of an atomic line filter to the LIDAR equipment effectively filters interference to the laser's signal {{to the point where}} LIDAR data can be collected at any time of the day. For the past decade, Faraday filters have been used to do this. Consequently, scientists know significantly more today about the Earth's middle atmosphere than they did before the advent of the FADOF.|$|E

500|$|David Fricke of the Rolling Stone in {{a review}} of ¡Uno! {{compared}} the theme of the song with [...] "Stay the Night", another song on the album, stating; [...] "'Stay the Night' and 'Let Yourself Go' are the kind of pop-smart here's-my-fucking-problem miniatures Armstrong was writing like second nature when he, Dirnt and Cool were too young to drink (legally) where they gigged. But Armstrong is 40 now, married and a dad, and a lot of this ruckus sounds designed to <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> time bombs ticking in his head and the maddening static outside".|$|E
500|$|There {{was just}} enough time before nightfall to storm the {{position}} on its north side (mainly up the steepest part of the slope immediately north of Gustavus's fort), but {{not enough time to}} develop simultaneous attacks from other sides. The attack went in around 18:00, led by the advanced guard of the 'forlorn hope'. This force of 80 English grenadiers from the 1st English Foot Guards, led by Viscount Mordaunt and Colonel Richard Munden, was designed to draw the enemy fire and thus enable the Allied commanders to discern the defensive strong points. The main force followed closely behind. [...] "The rapidity of their movements, together with their loud yells, were truly alarming", recalled la Colonie, who, in order to <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> shouts and hurrahs, ordered his drummer to beat charge [...] "so as to drown them with their noise, lest they should have a bad effect upon our people." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1993, U2 were in Europe for the [...] "Zooropa" [...] leg {{of their}} Zoo TV Tour. Before their 3July show in Verona, Italy, the band {{received}} a fax from Radio and Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina {{asking for an}} interview regarding the situation in Bosnia. The band agreed and met with an American aid worker named Bill Carter, who acted as the station's foreign associate, due to Serbian travel restrictions. Carter described his experiences in Sarajevo helping Bosnians while surviving the dangerous living conditions. Lead vocalist Bono was unnerved to hear that those living in makeshift bomb shelters in the city played music, including U2's, at loud volumes to <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> sound of explosions. While in Sarajevo, Carter had seen a television interview on MTV in which Bono mentioned {{the theme of the}} Zooropa tour leg was a unified Europe. Feeling that such an aim was empty if ignoring the Bosnians' plight, Carter sought Bono's help. He requested that U2 go to Sarajevo to bring attention to the war and break the [...] "media fatigue" [...] that had occurred from covering the conflict.|$|E

2500|$|CDJournal reviewers {{called the}} song addictive, praising Sheena's lyricism and the [...] "jazz taste sound". They {{described}} the song as [...] "jazz kayō", and noted the melody was distinctly Sheena-like. They described the B-side [...] "La salle de bain" [...] as a [...] "spectacle tune" [...] from a [...] fantastic film, and praised how the sound interacted with Sheena's vocals, noting how over-orchestration did not <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> song. They noted progressive rock-like qualities in the song. The final B-side [...] "Ringo Catalogue" [...] {{was described as}} a [...] "pop-rock tune", and the compilation not being simply stitched together was praised.

2500|$|Through the 19th century, a {{roll call}} of legendary actors' names all but <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> plays {{in which they}} appear: Sarah Siddons (1755—1831), John Philip Kemble (1757—1823), Henry Irving (1838—1905), and Ellen Terry (1847—1928). To be a star of the {{legitimate}} drama came to mean being {{first and foremost a}} [...] "great Shakespeare actor", with a famous interpretation of, for men, Hamlet, and for women, Lady Macbeth, and especially with a striking delivery of the great soliloquies. The acme of spectacle, star, and soliloquy of Shakespeare performance came with the reign of actor-manager Henry Irving and his co-star Ellen Terry in their elaborately staged productions, often with orchestral incidental music, at the Lyceum Theatre, London from 1878 to 1902. At the same time, a revolutionary return to the roots of Shakespeare's original texts, and to the platform stage, absence of scenery, and fluid scene changes of the Elizabethan theatre, was being effected by William Poel's Elizabethan Stage Society.|$|E
2500|$|The {{residents}} of Catfish Row are all gathered in Serena's room for {{shelter from the}} hurricane. They <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> sound of the storm with prayers and hymns ("Oh, Doctor Jesus") while Sportin' Life mocks their assumption that the storm is a signal of Judgment Day. Clara desperately sings her lullaby ("Summertime" [...] ). A knock is heard at the door, and the chorus believes it to be Death ("Oh there's somebody knocking at the door"). Crown enters dramatically, having swum from Kittiwah Island, seeking Bess. He shows no fear of God, claiming that after the long struggle from Kittiwah, God and he are friends. The chorus tries to drown out his blaspheming with more prayer, and he taunts them by singing a vulgar song. ("A red-headed woman"). Suddenly, Clara sees Jake's boat float past the window, upside-down, and she runs out {{to try to save}} him, handing her baby to Bess. Bess asks that one of the men go out with her, and Crown taunts Porgy, who cannot go. Crown goes himself, yelling out as he leaves [...] "Alright, Big Friend! We're on for another Bout!" [...] The chorus continue to pray as the storm rises.|$|E

2500|$|The race effort {{turned out}} to be an almost total failure. The Freeman {{transmitter}} broke down — in a fit of rage, de Forest threw it overboard — and had to be replaced by an ordinary spark coil. Even worse, the American Wireless Telephone and Telegraph Company, which claimed its ownership of Amos Dolbear's 1886 patent for wireless communication meant it held a monopoly for all wireless communication in the United States, had also set up a powerful transmitter. None of these companies had effective tuning for their transmitters, so only one could transmit at a time without causing mutual interference. Although an attempt was made to have the three systems avoid conflicts by rotating operations over five-minute intervals, the agreement broke down, resulting in chaos as the simultaneous transmissions clashed with each other. De Forest ruefully noted that under these conditions the only successful [...] "wireless" [...] communication was done by visual semaphore [...] "wig-wag" [...] flags. (The 1903 International Yacht races would be a repeat of 1901 — Marconi worked for the Associated Press, de Forest for the Publishers' Press Association, and the unaffiliated International Wireless Company (successor to 1901's American Wireless Telephone and Telegraph) operated a high-powered transmitter that was used primarily to <b>drown</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> other two.) ...|$|E
