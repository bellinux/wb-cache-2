Our research project has investigated and developed the practical classroom implementation of Learning Plans as a personal taskmanagement scaffold for student learning. The teacher's role in enabling self-organized learning for large groups of students can be achieved through the deployment of Learning Plans, which converts teachercentered curriculum management into student-centered learning tasks.

A large number of methods <b>for</b> <b>scaffolding</b> group deliberation on complex issues has evolved over the last few decades, however little research has been conducted to date on what functions these methods actually perform. The study in this article differentiates between the functions that may need to be scaffolded, and the means used <b>for</b> <b>scaffolding</b> such functions. A literature review and interviews with eight experienced facilitators led to a typology comprising of 24 functions that various deliberative methods are assumed to perform. The typology also describes some of the risks associated with a neglect to scaffold each function. An inventory was made of techniques and facilitator actions used in different methods and by individual facilitators in order to scaffold the 24 functions. The typology of functions may be useful in empirical research on deliberative methods, for evaluation purposes, and for supporting further development of skillfulness among facilitators...|$|R
