40|$|Adaptive cluster {{sampling}} is an efficient {{method of estimating}} the parameters of rare and clustered populations. The method mimics how biologists would like to collect data in the field by targeting survey effort to localised areas where the rare population occurs. Another popular sampling design is <b>inverse</b> <b>sampling.</b> <b>Inverse</b> <b>sampling</b> was developed {{so as to be}} able to obtain a sample of rare events having a predetermined size. Ideally, in <b>inverse</b> <b>sampling,</b> the resultant sample set will be sufficiently large to ensure reliable estimation of population parameters. In an effort to combine the good properties of these two designs, adaptive {{cluster sampling}} and <b>inverse</b> <b>sampling,</b> we introduce inverse adaptive cluster sampling with unequal selection probabilities. We develop an unbiased estimator of the population total that is applicable to data obtained from such designs. We also develop numerical approximations to this estimator. The efficiency of the estimators that we introduce is investigated through simulation studies based on two real populations: crabs in Al Khor, Qatar and arsenic pollution in Kurdistan, Iran. The simulation results show that our estimators are efficient. Qatar National Research Fund. NPRP 4 - 001 - 1 - 001 Wiley Online Librar...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} basic problem of robust {{subspace}} recovery. That is, we assume a data set that some of its points are sampled around a fixed subspace {{and the rest of}} them are spread in the whole ambient space, and we aim to recover the fixed underlying subspace. We first estimate "robust <b>inverse</b> <b>sample</b> covariance" by solving a convex minimization procedure; we then recover the subspace by the bottom eigenvectors of this matrix (their number correspond to the number of eigenvalues close to 0). We guarantee exact subspace recovery under some conditions on the underlying data. Furthermore, we propose a fast iterative algorithm, which linearly converges to the matrix minimizing the convex problem. We also quantify the effect of noise and regularization and discuss many other practical and theoretical issues for improving the subspace recovery in various settings. When replacing the sum of terms in the convex energy function (that we minimize) with the sum of squares of terms, we obtain that the new minimizer is a scaled version of the <b>inverse</b> <b>sample</b> covariance (when exists). We thus interpret our minimizer and its subspace (spanned by its bottom eigenvectors) as robust versions of the empirical inverse covariance and the PCA subspace respectively.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} {{interval}} estimation methods for means of bounded random variables {{based on a}} sequential procedure such that the sampling is continued until the sample sum is no less than a prescribed threshold. 1 <b>Inverse</b> <b>Sampling</b> It is a ubiquitous problem to estimate the means of bounded random variables. Specially, the problem of estimating the probability of an event can be formulated as the estimation of the mean of a Bernoulli variable. Moreover, in many applications, one needs to estimate a quantity µ which can be bounded in [0, 1] after proper operations of scaling and translation. A typical approach is to design an experiment that produces a random variable X distributed in [0, 1] with expectation µ, run the experiment independently a number of times, and use {{the average of the}} outcomes as the estimate [1]. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop interval estimation methods for the means of bounded variables based a sequential sampling scheme described as follows. Let X ∈ [0, 1] be a bounded random variable defined in a probability space (Ω,F,Pr) with expectation E[X] = µ ∈ (0, 1). We wish to estimate the mean of X by using a sequence of i. i. d. random samples X 1, X 2, · · · of X based on the following <b>inverse</b> <b>sampling</b> scheme: Continue sampling until the sample size reach a number n such that the sample sum ∑ n i= 1 Xi is no less than a positive number γ.

40|$|The fate {{of arsenic}} {{introduced}} to the environment {{as a result of}} the natural and human activities is an important issue. Surveys of arsenic typically involve sampling from a large area. Measuring arsenic concentrations in samples is expensive, and any improvement in the survey design is welcome. One way to improve efficiency in sampling is to make use of auxiliary information. Surveys of environmental pollution can be classed as surveys of rare populations, where there is a large area with a small polluted subarea. The rare population has many zeroes, or low, values, and contaminated subareas have non-zero, or high, values. Regression estimators or ratio estimators are undefined for those samples containing only information from the non-rare (zero-value) subpopulation (i. e., the non-contaminated subpopulation) in simple random sampling. In this paper, we introduce the modified regression estimators and their associated variance estimators for sampling designs which are suitable for rare populations, such as general <b>inverse</b> <b>sampling</b> and <b>inverse</b> <b>sampling</b> with unequal selection probabilities. We conducted a simulation study on the real rare population arsenic contamination in Kurdistan. The simulation results showed that the modified regression estimators are more efficient than the previous estimators. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Wiley Online librar...|$|E
