In this paper, we attempt a different explanation of the causes and consequences of debt overhang.

40|$|How can NGOs {{contribute}} to strengthening the democratic legitimacy of international intergovernmental institutions? The thesis pursues {{two lines of}} enquiry in order to {{contribute to}} this discussion {{in the context of}} global environmental politics: it looks at the <b>external</b> <b>claims</b> and internal practices of NGOs. With regards to <b>external</b> <b>claims</b> the thesis investigates the democratic demands formulated by the NGO communities interacting with the UNFCCC and the CBD respectively. Demands for equitable representation at the intergovernmental level and for participation by civil society stakeholders are especially prominent among the NGOs engaged with the climate convention. The thesis finds a convergence around very similar democratic demands across the NGO community, most of which draw upon recurrent governance norms and existing instances of good practice within environmental institutions. The thesis then turns to the internal practices of large international environmental NGOs to test the assumption that these organisations have the potential to act as “links” or as “transmission belts” between local communities and global policymaking processes. It proposes the adoption of a representation perspective for analysing the contribution of civil society organisations, and provides case studies of three large international environmental NGOs (WWF, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth) and of the two issue-­specific civil society networks that organise NGO activities around the two UN conventions referred to above (the Climate Action Network and the CBD Alliance). The thesis shows that the potential for large NGOs to ‘represent’ local communities is shaped by organisational structures, decision-­making processes, the strategy for bringing about change, funding sources, alliances and partnerships, and values. The findings underline the need to adopt a more differentiated understanding of the democratic contribution by civil society organisations to international intergovernmental institutions...|$|E

The issues investigated include the categories of staff within contracting organizations who contribute to delay claims analyses, the awareness, use and reliability of existing delay analysis methods and the obstacles to their use in practice.

Despite the fact that the corporate {{social responsibility}} as an institutionalized organizational management process has existed for more than 50 years, it has not yet received the deserved scientific attention, and its various aspects are still subject to debates.

Thus, it is crucial to study the priorities of small and medium-sized organizations in the corporate social responsibility field. The authors conducted an empirical exploratory study of the Russian small and medium-sized business organizations and found out that their representatives do not have a clear understanding of the directions and methods of implementing the social responsibility model. For instance, the standards developed for large organizations to implement the ideas of corporate social responsibility are too global and too costly for small and medium-sized businesses, however the latter in Russia still do not have their own technologies and algorithms for implementing an appropriate model of social responsibility (except for some types of charity and requirements to retrain workers, which are considered rather <b>external</b> <b>claims)</b> ...|$|E

40|$|In {{terms of}} {{international}} law, IS naturally poses {{questions on the}} law of insurgency and international humanitarian law (ius in bello). However, IS claims to operate inside a distinct and parallel law, i. e. Islamic (international) law, the primary sources of which are the Qur’an and Sunnah. The support IS enjoys from their recruits and from {{a significant part of the}} population over which it is currently exercising power stems directly from this claim.

In light of this and in light of the fact that in most Muslim majority states, secularism has never obtained the respect it enjoys in the West, it is thus important to ask the questions of legitimacy of IS and their actions from within the norms of Islamic international law. This study therefore essentially aims to provide answers to questions already raised by many scholars and international organisations: What are the justifications for waging war on which the self-declared Islamic State relies? Are these justifications valid under Islamic international law? Who can declare jihād and under what conditions? Could IS still rightfully claim to be a caliphate under Shari’a, regardless of a lack of international recognition?

40|$|In a two-country {{portfolio}} {{model with}} leverage constraints, I focus on private assets {{in order to}} understand how their behaviour can justify an expected excess return as well as the flight-to-safety observed in the data. The specific goal is to study how much these phenomena are {{explained by the fact that}} investors cannot always borrow the same amount of resources pledging domestic assets as pledging foreign collateral. Modeling the leverage constraints accordingly, I propose a methodology to deal with this heterogeneous pledgeability and solve for country portfolios. The central feature of this approach is that any idiosyncratic shocks generate an expected excess returns which compensate the current effects of the shock on the relative riskiness of local versus foreign collateral. The resulting portfolio solution shows that, in equilibrium, investors care for this risk and renounce to a part of the expected excess return - favouring current borrowing. The main consequences are: the home equity bias is smaller than in a model where assets are homogeneously pledgeable; the ex post dynamics of the relative premium paid on collateralized assets contribute to the cross-border transmission of shocks. Given these dynamics, idiosyncratic shocks to the pledgeability of local assets affect the value of <b>external</b> <b>claims</b> and liabilities of the country hit by the shock in such a way that its net foreign assets match those observed in the data during times of flight-to-safety. portfolio choice, riskiness of pledged collateral, return di¤erentials, macroeconomic interdependence...|$|E
40|$|The {{causes and}} {{implications}} of the developing country debt crisis - {{as well as its}} solution - all have an important fiscal dimension. The crisis was triggered by the widespread perception that the public sectors in many heavily indebted countries were effectively insolvent in the international environment of the early 1980 s. The actual fiscal response to the resulting liquidity crisis involved increased reliance on domestic financing, the inflation tax, and the curtailment of public investment. This created adverse adjustment incentives for policymakers and resulted in credit rationing, capital flight, assumption of private <b>external</b> <b>claims</b> by the public sector, and poor domestic investment performance. Solutions involve restoring fiscal health through a combination of debt relief and efficient fiscal adjustment, aimed at mitigating the burden associated with public sector debt service and minimizing the liquidity problems facing the indebted public sector. The debt and debt-service reduction (DDSR) programs implemented so far under the Brady Plan have provided only partial solutions, closing without eliminating the gap between the face value of the external debt and the present value of prospective public sector debt service. They have done so partly by reducing the former and partly by increasing the latter. Their contribution toward easing the immediate liquidity problems of the debtors has not been encouraging. The amount of debt relief embodied in Brady Plan programs enacted so far has not in itself been sufficient to restore fiscal solvency. Better-quality fiscal adjustment could greatly help improve the situation. The most important potential contribution of such programs, then, may have been the reduction - through the policy conditionality associated with resources provided by the international financial institutions - of the secondary burden associated with the internal transfer of resources to the public sector.

40|$|Mapping {{ecosystem}} services (ES) and their trade-offs {{is a key}} requirement for informed decision making for land use planning and management of natural resources that aim to move towards increasing the sustainability of landscapes. The negotiations {{of the purposes of}} landscapes and the services they should provide are difficult as there is an increasing number of stakeholders active at different levels with a variety of interests present on one particular landscape. Traditionally, land cover data is at the basis for mapping and spatial monitoring of {{ecosystem services}}. In light of complex landscapes it is however questionable whether land cover per se and as a spatial base unit is suitable for monitoring and management at the meso-scale. Often the characteristics of a landscape are defined by prevalence, composition and specific spatial and temporal patterns of different land cover types. The spatial delineation of shifting cultivation agriculture represents a prominent example of a land use system with its different land use intensities that requires alternative methodologies that go beyond the common remote sensing approaches of pixel-based land cover analysis due to the spatial and temporal dynamics of rotating cultivated and fallow fields. Against this background we advocate that adopting a landscape perspective to spatial planning and decision making offers new space for negotiation and collaboration, taking into account the needs of local resource users, and of the global community. For this purpose we introduce landscape mosaicsdefined as new spatial unit describing generalized land use types. Landscape mosaics have allowed us to chart different land use systems and land use intensities and permitted us to delineate changes in these land use systems based on changes of <b>external</b> <b>claims</b> on these landscapes. The underlying idea behindthe landscape mosaics is to use land cover data typically derived from remote sensing data and to analyse and classify spatial patterns of this land cover data using a moving window approach.

40|$|Judges argue {{within a}} legal frame of reference. They {{identify}} and interpret this frame and read factual situations before {{them in the}} light of it. By interpreting the law and the facts coherently with the relevant legal frame of reference they aim to objectively justify their decisions. This may sound naïve and often be much less heroic in practice. However, the core value of separation of powers and of independent judicial review is widely accepted, including the added value of the judiciary’s attempts to objectify what is ‘just’ outside of the political power struggle. Judicial discourse, it is here argued, could help the judiciary to continue to offer this objectifying value in a pluricontextual setting, where the internal and the external become increasingly interlocked because policy making is increasingly externalized, rights relevant decisions are taken by the executive outside the domestic constitutional framework, and an increasing number of players claim authority, including ultimate authority, to govern a legal situation. The chapter hopes to contribute to the thinking {{about the role of the}} judiciary in a pluricontextual setting and turns to the European Union (EU) for inspiration. Within the EU the relationship between EU law on the one hand and the Member States collectively and individually on the other is characterized by an on-going pulling and pushing of law and politics. Both the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and Member States’ courts have long functioned in this setting. The Union legal order is a compound constitutionalized construction with interlocking claims of ultimate authority. This chapter considers what could be learned from interaction between different judiciaries within the EU legal order for the CJEU’s approach to <b>external</b> <b>claims</b> of authority. Section One lays out the theoretical grounding of the value and necessity of judicial reasoning. It then makes the argument that both within the EU and beyond the boundaries of the EU legal order, the same philosophical arguments and theories require not only an inward looking judicial reasoning but also a discourse with other judicial bodies. Section Two looks consequently into the practice of judicial interaction between the CJEU and the courts of the Member States (internal discourse) and then to the interaction between the CJEU and international judicial bodies (external discourse). This sets the scene for Section Three, which addresses the core questions of this chapter: What lessons can the CJEU learn from the internal European judicial discourse that can be transferred to the external discourse with international courts and tribunals? What considerations should guide the CJEU’s external relations case law in the described pluricontextual setting...|$|E
40|$|The Asian {{financial}} crisis in 1997 revealed important {{deficiencies in the}} monitoring of short-term external debt, often {{the most important and}} also most volatile component of countries' external obligations. As underlined in the report prepared by the Working Group on Capital Flows of the Financial Stability Forum, "short-term flows entail liquidity risk and, therefore, are of special concern from a financial stability perspective". As a result, "special attention to the build-up of short-term debt is warranted". The new Joint BIS IMF-OECD-World Bank Statistics on External Debt collaboratively published by the four international organisations since March 1999 facilitate the monitoring of external debt. They bring together in one place and on a consistent basis creditor and market data disseminated by the individual agencies, and major components of short-term debt are identified separately. Conceptual and statistical discrepancies between creditor- and debtor-based statistics have, however, caused concern. As a consequence, the BIS, with support from a number of emerging market central banks, has undertaken a study to compare existing creditor and debtor data on external debt. The results are presented in this report, which mainly serves the following purposes: First, we explain conceptual and practical differences between creditor short-term <b>external</b> <b>claims</b> series, which are supplied mainly by the BIS, and the corresponding debtor series. Second, we discuss possible options for adapting the presentation of the BIS data (assuming unchanged reporting) to reduce perceived differences between creditor and debtor data. Third, senior statisticians and economists from nine emerging market central banks provide a description of the current collection and publication of external debt statistics in their respective countries. The report is divided into two parts. Part I of the report contains the results of the BIS comparative study, while Part II covers the national contributions on external debt statistics. Part I consists of four chapters. Chapter 1 describes recent progress in improving the accuracy of BIS creditor data. In Chapter 2 the main conceptual differences between official guidelines for the reporting of external debt, on the one hand, and reporting conventions for the main source of creditor data, the BIS consolidated and locational banking statistics, on the other, are discussed. There is currently no prospect of changing the reporting of BIS data, because these data are not collected for external debt monitoring purposes. However, one can adjust components of both BIS data sets to approximate more closely standard external debt concepts. On the basis of a survey of 22 developing countries and follow up visits to eight countries, Chapter 3 compares short-term creditor and debtor data in practice. The chapter identifies both general and specific sources of differences and describes the feasibility and limits of reconciliation. Chapter 4 discusses possible options for changing the presentation of BIS creditor data in the joint statistics to reduce differences from short-term debtor data. Part II of the report contains contributions by senior statisticians and economists from nine emerging market central banks for a workshop held at the BIS in April 2002 to discuss the results of the comparative study undertaken by the BIS. The contributions describe the current collection and publication of external debt statistics in the respective emerging market countries and provide additional analysis on the causes of differences between national debtor data and BIS creditor data on external debt. In addition, Part II of the report includes a contribution from the IMF on the new draft guide on external debt statistics. ...|$|E
