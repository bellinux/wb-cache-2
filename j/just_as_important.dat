5|$|Commercial sealing was {{historically}} <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> {{an industry}} as whaling. Exploited species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and all species of fur seal. The scale of seal harvesting decreased substantially after the 1960s, after the Canadian government reduced {{the length of}} the hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult females. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur seals may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting. The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on Guadalupe Island. It has since recolonized much of its historic range, but has a population bottleneck. Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and northwest Africa, and only remains in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.|$|E

5000|$|... == Stability == Through {{research}} {{carried out}} by Mary Karpen, Pieter De Haseth and Kenneth Neet, new findings in the partial stability in 310-helices were uncovered. The helices are most noticeably stabilized by an aspartate residue at the nonpolar N-terminus that interacts with the amide group at the helical N-cap. This electrostatic interaction stabilizes the peptide dipoles in a parallel orientation. Much like the contiguous helical hydrogen bonds that stabilize α-helices, high levels of aspartate are <b>just</b> <b>as</b> equally <b>important</b> in {{the survival of the}} 310-helix. High frequency of aspartate in both 310-helix and α-helices is indicative of its helix initiation, {{but at the same time}} suggests that it favors stabilization of the 310-helix by inhibiting the propagation of α-helices.|$|R

György Málnási Bartók, the Professor of the Department of Philosophy, was an avid supporter of the petition, since the tuition of Psychology had been the responsibility of his department at that period. In his petition, Imre Sándor listed the following fields and branches as belonging to the new Department's sphere of competence: General Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Psychology of Differences, Education of Backward Children, Psychotechnics, and Pedagogical Somatology.|$|E
25|$|Germany's {{defeat in}} World War I, {{the fall of}} the German monarchy and the {{abolition}} of censorship under the new, liberal Weimar Republic allowed an upsurge of radical experimentation in all the arts, which had been suppressed by the old regime. Many Germans of left-wing views were influenced by the cultural experimentation that followed the Russian Revolution, such as constructivism. Such influences can be overstated: Gropius did not share these radical views, and said that Bauhaus was entirely apolitical. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> was the influence of the 19th century English designer William Morris, who had argued that art should meet the needs of society and {{that there should be no}} distinction between form and function. Thus, the Bauhaus style, also known as the International Style, was marked by the absence of ornamentation and by harmony between the function of an object or a building and its design.|$|E

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a survey study of 382 {{managers}} {{from a variety of}} public and private sector organizations, on the values that guide sectoral decision making. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> some <b>important</b> classical differences emerge, a number of similarities between the public and private sector appear to result in a set of common core organizational values. Furthermore, the data support neither increasing adoption of business values in public sector organizations nor flirtation with public values by business sector managers. This contradicts expectations in the literature on new public management and corporate social responsibility, suggesting public-private value intermixing. Value solidity seems the dominant feature in both sectors. Additional analysis shows that "publicness," the extent to which an organization belongs to the public or the private sector- rather than age, gender, years of service or a past in the other sector-strongly determines value preferences. © 2008 Sage Publications...|$|R

25|$|The {{independent}} architectural {{language of}} Enric Miralles {{can be difficult}} to classify in terms of contemporary architecture. It is influenced by Spanish architects, such as Alejandro de la Sota, José Antonio Coderch and Josep Maria Jujol, and also from international greats such as Le Corbusier, Louis Kahn and Alvar Aalto and the Russian Constructivist movement of the early 20th century. The freely formed buildings utilising massive building materials and steel, develop from their relationship with the environment and connect themselves to it. The form is constructed using often unusual materials which are generally left with natural surfaces. Form and material interpret the place, traditions and history in a personal and poetic art, as his critics attest. From the starting point of the townscape or landscape he would design a building in its totality, down to the details of the furnishing and the exterior installations. Therefore, the execution of the details was <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> to the communication of meaning as the main form. Both were developed over a large number of designs and with numerous models as the main tool of the design process.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{last few}} years have seen an {{increasing}} understanding that dynamic time warping (DTW), a technique that allows local flexibility in aligning time series, is superior to the ubiquitous Euclidean distance for time series classification, clustering, and indexing.

In this work, we note that for many real world problems, it is necessary to combine both DTW and US to achieve meaningful results. This is particularly true in domains where we must account for the natural variability of human actions, including biometrics, query by humming, motion-capture/animation, and handwriting recognition. We introduce the first technique which can handle both DTW and US simultaneously, our techniques involve search pruning by means of a lower bounding technique and multi-dimensiona...|$|R
