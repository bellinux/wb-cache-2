50|$|Radar systems work {{by sending}} out a signal and then {{listening}} for its <b>echo</b> <b>off</b> distant objects. Each of these paths, {{to and from}} the target, is subject to the inverse square law of propagation in both the transmitted signal and the signal reflected back. That means that a radars received energy drops with the fourth power of the distance, which is why radar systems require high powers, often in the megawatt range, to be effective at long range.|$|E

There were originally 450 to 470 Africans, but that number had dwindled to 306 {{when they arrived at}} Castle Pickney, Charleston, South Carolina. Congressional law required the return of the Africans to Monrovia, Liberia and the huge size of the Niagara made her well suited for returning them. On 20 September, Capt. John S. Chauncey boarded 271 Africans who were suffering terribly from scurvy and dysentery. Chauncey expected to reach Africa in twenty days, but that changed when a heavy northwest wind took the Niagara way off course. Seventy-one Africans died before he reached Monrovia on 9 November. Captain Chauncey sent 200 survivors ashore and arrived back in New York Harbor on 11 December. Six days later, the Niagara was decommissioned.|$|E

The people walk behind the wall so their bodies do not cast shadows for the prisoners to see, but the objects they carry do ("just as puppet showmen have screens in front of them at which they work their puppets" [...] (514a)). The prisoners cannot see any of what is happening behind them, they are only able to see the shadows cast upon the cave wall in front of them.

Like today's low-end digital fathometers, they kept no record of the depth over time and provided no information about bottom structure. They had poor accuracy, especially in rough water, and were hard to read in bright light. Despite the limitations, they were still usable for rough estimates of depth, such as for verifying that the boat had not drifted into an unsafe area.|$|R

40|$|A good fi shfi nder {{depends on}} an effi cient {{transducer}} to {{send and receive}} signals. The transducer {{is the heart of}} an echosounder system. It is the device that changes electrical pulses into sound waves or acoustic energy and back again. In other words, it is the device that sends out the sound waves and then receives the echoes, so the echosounder can interpret or “detect ” what is {{below the surface of the}} water. How Does a Transducer Work? The easiest way to understand how a transducer functions is to think of it as a speaker and a microphone built into one unit. A transducer receives sequences of high-voltage electrical pulses called transmit pulses from the echosounder. Just like the stereo speakers at home, the transducer then converts the transmit pulses into sound. The sound travels through the water as pressure waves. When a wave strikes an object like a weed, a rock, a fi sh, or the bottom, the wave is refl ected. The wave is said to echo—just as your voice will <b>echo</b> <b>off</b> a canyon wall.

40|$|All stars exhibit {{intensity}} fluctuations {{over several}} timescales, from nanoseconds to years. These intensity fluctuations <b>echo</b> <b>off</b> bodies and {{structures in the}} star system. We posit {{that it is possible}} to take advantage of these echoes to detect, and possibly image, Earth-scale exoplanets. Unlike direct imaging techniques, temporal measurements do not require fringe tracking, maintaining an optically-perfect baseline, or utilizing ultra-contrast coronagraphs. Unlike transit or radial velocity techniques, stellar echo detection is not constrained to any specific orbital inclination. Current results suggest that existing and emerging technology can already enable stellar echo techniques at flare stars, such as Proxima Centauri, including detection, spectroscopic interrogation, and possibly even continent-level imaging of exoplanets in a variety of orbits. Detection of Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars appears to be extremely challenging, but cannot be fully quantified without additional data on micro- and millisecond-scale intensity fluctuations of the Sun. We consider survey missions in the mold of Kepler and place preliminary constraints on the feasibility of producing 3 D tomographic maps of other structures in star systems, such as accretion disks. In this report we discuss the theory, limitations, models, and future opportunities for stellar echo imaging...|$|E

40|$|We present new, very late-time optical {{photometry}} and spectroscopy of {{the interesting}} Type II-P supernova, SN 2002 hh, in NGC 6946. Gemini/GMOS-N {{has been used to}} acquire visible spectra at six epochs between 2004 August and 2006 July, following the evolution of the SN from age 661 to 1358 days. Few optical spectra of Type II supernovae with ages greater than one year exist. In addition, g′r′i ′ images were acquired at all six epochs. The spectral and photometric evolution of SN 2002 hh has been very unusual. Measures of the brightness of this SN, both in the R and I bands {{as well as in the}} Hα emission flux, show no significant fading over an interval of nearly two years. The most straightforward explanation for this behavior is that the light being measured comes not only from the SN itself but also from an <b>echo</b> <b>off</b> of nearby dust. Echoes have been detected previously around several SNe but these echoes, at their brightest, were ∼ 8 mag below the maximum brightness of the SN. At V∼ 21 mag, the putative echo dominates the light of SN 2002 hh and is only ∼ 4 mag below the outburst’s peak brightness. There is an estimated 6 magnitudes of total extinction in V towards SN 2002 hh. The proposed explanation of a differential echo/SN absorption is inconsistent with the observed BVRI colors.
