This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt {{to cover it up}} by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.|$|E
25|$|The {{legalization of}} {{sterilization}} {{was followed by}} a steady increase in the popularity of the procedure, both among the Puerto Rican population and among physicians working in Puerto Rico. Though sterilization could be performed on men and women, women were most likely to undergo the procedure. Sterilization was most frequently recommended by physicians because of a pervasive belief that Puerto Ricans and the poor were not intelligent enough to use other forms of contraception. Physicians and hospitals alike also implemented <b>hospital</b> <b>policy</b> to encourage sterilization, with some hospitals refusing to admit healthy pregnant women for delivery unless they consented to be sterilized. This has been best documented at Presbyterian Hospital, where the unofficial policy for a time was to refuse admittance for delivery to women who already had three living children unless she consented to sterilization. There is additional evidence that true informed consent was not obtained from patients before they underwent sterilization, if consent was solicited at all.|$|E

40|$|Brief {{cessation}} {{advice from}} health-care {{professionals in the}} hospital setting significantly {{increases the likelihood of}} patients quitting smoking, yet patients are not routinely provided with this advice. Smoke-free <b>hospital</b> <b>policies</b> aim to protect individuals from the adverse effects of smoking; however, it is unclear if such policies encourage systematic delivery of cessation advice by health-care professionals. The study’s aim was to determine the prevalence of smoking and cessation advice received by in-patients in two teaching hospitals in Ireland which have implemented smoke-free <b>hospital</b> <b>policies,</b> and to examine patient attitudes towards smoking cessation. Change in smoking prevalence and delivery of smoking cessation advice prior to and post-policy implementation was also examined in one hospital. This study surveyed 466 in-patients across 2 hospital sites, over a 3 -week and 5 - week period, respectively. Data were also compared to a survey completed prior to the implementation of the smoke-free policy in one of the hospital sites. Smoking prevalence was 17 % in Beaumont Hospital and 28 % in Connolly Hospital. Overall, nicotine dependence was low (Mean Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence = 4. 21, ± 2. 9). Overall, 62 % of smokers did not receive smoking cessation advice from a health professional, although 55 % indicated a willingness to engage with this type of service. The before-and-after analysis of Beaumont Hospital showed a reduction in smoking prevalence (17 % vs 21 %) amongst hospital in-patients, and a 6 % increase in reported cessation advice provided following the introduction of the <b>hospital</b> smoke-free <b>policy.</b> Smoke-free <b>hospital</b> <b>policies</b> play a role in decreasing the prevalence of in-patient smokers, but further intervention is needed to increase rates of cessation advice provided. Positive attitudes to smoking cessation, coupled with low average nicotine dependence, suggest that lowintensity interventions would be beneficial for most smokers.

30|$|This study offers future research, policy, and {{practice}} directions related to cultural competence. The discrepancy between employee responses and <b>hospital</b> <b>policies</b> raises several possibilities.

Techniques to achieve cultural competence can also be specified within <b>hospital</b> <b>policies</b> in an ongoing fashion so that clinicians who understand policies also have actionable procedures to accomplish goals. In addition, hospital leaders could incorporate patients, clinicians, and administrators in writing policies since culturally-competent care affects multiple stakeholders. Finally, patients and clinicians could initiate discussions on how to respect patient wishes and explain treatment options in advance of treating acute illnesses. More research is needed on how clinicians should ascertain and act as consultants or as educators to patients since patients have their own models of mental health illnesses and services that do not necessarily correspond with those of providers.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{high costs}} of new disease-modifying, but non-curative, {{treatments}} in advanced cancer are increasingly regarded as problematic. Little is known about oncologists' beliefs regarding their ethical obligations for cost considerations about these types of treatments. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This study used in-depth interviews to explore how physicians in The Netherlands view their role regarding the cost of potentially beneficial but expensive drugs, especially for new disease-modifying treatments in advanced cancer. Thirty-six physicians, 19 physicians caring for patients with advanced cancer and 17 physicians participating in four national oncology guideline committees, were interviewed. RESULTS: Physicians identified cost considerations on three levels: individual patient care, <b>hospital</b> <b>policies</b> and national guideline development. Generally, physicians were reluctant to consider costs in individual patient care, believing this compromised their ethical obligations. They did consider costs relevant {{at the level of}} <b>hospital</b> <b>policies</b> regarding coverage for drugs. They were divided regarding the role of cost considerations in national practice guideline development. CONCLUSIONS: The distinctive levels of decision-making were understood to be morally relevant as physicians separated their role as direct care provider from that of taking part in decisions about coverage. Because of the fundamental tension between the physician obligation to act {{in the best interest of}} the individual patient, the vulnerability of having a life-threatening illness and the inevitability of sharing resources in modern health care, cost considerations will always be problematic for physicians. The roles physicians play at different levels, especially at the levels of <b>hospital</b> <b>policies</b> and national practice guidelines, should further be developed and explicate...|$|R

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{provision of}} nursing service to patients {{is an important}} task. The continuity of services, i. e. 24 hours a day 7 days a week needs shifts working environment that may affect the changes in nurses’ daily social life and may cause health problems. Thus, {{the development of a}} quality nurse rostering model that is acceptable and fair to everyone is a must in order to ensure there is quality in this continuous service. Rostering process involves some rules and constraints based on <b>hospital’s</b> <b>policies</b> and nurses’ preferences. The <b>hospital’s</b> <b>policies</b> or objectives among others are to ensure the minimum number of nurses on duty for each shift, to avoid any isolated days on and to consider the nurses request for annual leave. Meanwhile the nurses’ preferences are having the same number of days on per schedule, the number of morning shifts more than the evening shifts and at least 1 day off during weekend for 2 weeks planning period. The developed model is illustrated on data from a local hospital. A 0 - 1 goal programming technique is applied to building the nurse rostering model because of its ability to produce the model with multiple objectives. This work schedule will be generated every 2 weeks. The result obtained by Lingo software shows that the developed nurse rostering model fulfilled the <b>hospital’s</b> <b>policies</b> and the nurses’ preferences.
