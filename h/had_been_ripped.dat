5|$|Frank was autopsied twice, {{the second}} time to recover debris {{embedded}} in his body. The autopsy revealed that his lower extremities <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>ripped</b> off; his muscle tissue was extensively mutilated and torn; small pieces of wire, brass, and miscellaneous articles including a hat ornament were imbedded in various limbs; {{the fingers of his}} right hand were fractured and the bones splintered; and the distal phalanx of each finger on his left hand were missing. The coroner also observed numerous patches of blackened areas, similar to close-range gunshot residue. Four human finger bones were discovered among the wreckage at the primary crash site.|$|E
5|$|It {{was written}} by Ron Hauge, {{directed}} by Bob Anderson, and guest starred Alex Trebek as himself. Hauge was inspired to write the episode after learning of an orphanage that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>ripped</b> off. The episode was selected, among other Christmas themed episodes of the series, on an 2005 Christmas special boxed set on DVD. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide criticized the episode as a rehash of older themes, {{but it was also}} described as one of The Simpsons’ more memorable episodes in a review of the 2005 DVD boxed set release.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were two}} serious {{injuries}} on board: a fracture and laceration of a foot, and an acute back strain requiring {{two days of}} hospitalization. [...] The aircraft was significantly damaged by the excessive G-forces. [...] The wings were permanently bent upwards by , the inboard main landing gear lost two actuator doors, and the two inboard main gear struts were left dangling. Most affected was the tail, where large outer parts of the horizontal stabilizer <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>ripped</b> off. [...] The entire left outboard elevator had been lost along with its actuator, which had been powered by the hydraulic system that ruptured and drained.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{attempts}} were made to land at Ferryfield, but a go-around was performed each time on instructions from the airport operator. On the third approach, the starboard engine spluttered and stopped, followed shortly after by the port engine.

[...] Leneve swore that he gave four blasts on Charm whistle as a warning signal, but this was ignored by Telegraph, which went ahead full speed and rammed Charm, damaging Charm {{so much that the}} motor vessel had to be beached to prevent it from sinking. [...] Leneve said the bulwarks {{on the left side of}} Charm were damaged, and the fender strake (which protected the hull from damage) <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>ripped</b> all along the length of the vessel.|$|E
2500|$|Charlotte wrote four long, very personal, and {{sometimes}} vague letters to Monsieur Héger that never received replies. The extent of Charlotte Brontë's feelings for Heger were not fully realised until 1913, when her letters to him were published {{for the first}} time. Heger had first shown them to Mrs. Gaskell when she visited him in 1856 while researching her biography The Life of Charlotte Brontë, but she concealed their true significance. These letters, {{referred to as the}} [...] "Heger Letters", <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>ripped</b> up at some stage by Heger, but his wife had retrieved the pieces from the wastepaper bin and meticulously glued or sewn them back together. Paul Heger, Constantin's son, and his sisters gave these letters to the British Museum, and they were shortly thereafter printed in The Times newspaper.|$|E
2500|$|In 1867, in {{the library}} of Northumberland House, one John Bruce {{happened}} upon a bundle of bound documents, some of whose sheets <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>ripped</b> away. It had comprised numerous of Bacon's oratories and disquisitions, had also apparently held copies of the plays Richard II and Richard III, The Isle of Dogs and Leicester's Commonwealth, but these had been removed. [...] On the outer sheet was scrawled repeatedly the names of Bacon and Shakespeare along with the name of Thomas Nashe. [...] There were several quotations from Shakespeare and a reference to the word Honorificabilitudinitatibus, which appears in both Love's Labour's Lost and Nashe's Lenten Stuff. The Earl of Northumberland sent the bundle to James Spedding, who subsequently penned a thesis on the subject, with which was published a facsimile of the aforementioned cover. [...] Spedding hazarded a 1592 date, making it possibly the earliest extant mention of Shakespeare.|$|E

2500|$|Tilikum, a male killer whale, {{has been}} {{involved}} in the death of three individuals since his capture near Iceland in November 1983. [...] In 1991, Tilikum and two other killer whales grabbed 20-year-old trainer Keltie Byrne in their mouths and tossed her to each other, drowning Byrne. On July 5, 1999, Daniel P. Dukes visited SeaWorld and stayed after the park closed, evading security so as to enter a killer whale tank. [...] He was found dead the next day, floating in Tilikum's pool. [...] He died due to a combination of hypothermia, trauma, and drowning but Dukes was covered in bruises, abrasions and bite marks, and his scrotum <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>ripped</b> open, indicating that Tilikum had toyed with the victim. [...] It is unclear whether Tilikum actually caused the man's death. On February 24, 2010, after a noontime performance at Sea World, Orlando, Florida, Tilikum killed trainer Dawn Brancheau during a training session with the whale. [...] This latest incident with Tilikum reawakened a heated discussion about the effect of captivity on the killer whale's behavior. [...] In May 2012, Occupational Safety and Health Administration administrative law judge Ken Welsch faulted SeaWorld for the death of Dawn Brancheau and introduced regulations requiring a physical barrier between trainers and killer whales.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 July, Golden Horn was matched against older {{horses for}} the first time when he was brought back in {{distance}} to contest the 120th running of the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse. He started the 4/9 favourite against four opponents headed by The Grey Gatsby, with the other runners being Cougar Mountain (third in the Queen Anne Stakes), Western Hymn (Prix Eugene Adam, Gordon Richards Stakes, Brigadier Gerard Stakes) and Tullius (Sandown Mile). With no recognised front-runner in the race, Frankie Dettori had admitted that: [...] "There is a possibility we could make the running if no-one else wants to. Otherwise we will sit off it. Golden Horn is very versatile but what we don’t want is a messy race. He is a Derby winner not a sprinter". Gosden was not overly enthusiastic about the colt's chances saying [...] "I {{have a lot of respect}} for The Grey Gatsby... these are top older horses we’re taking on... any horse can get beaten" [...] and described the horse's position as odds-on favourite as [...] "a bit unusual". As in the Derby, Dettori had a [...] "lucky" [...] piece of kit: the left boot he had worn at Epsom <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>ripped</b> at Royal Ascot, but the jockey insisted on having it repaired by his valet and wore it at Sandown.|$|E
2500|$|Fans began honoring Earnhardt {{by holding}} three fingers aloft {{on the third}} lap of every race, a black screen of No. 3 in the {{beginning}} of NASCAR Thunder 2002 before the EA Sports logo, and the television coverage of NASCAR on Fox and NASCAR on NBC went silent for each third lap from Rockingham to the following year's race there in honor of Earnhardt. On-track incidents brought out the caution flag on the third lap. Three weeks after Earnhardt's death, Harvick, driving a car that had been prepared for Earnhardt, scored his first career Cup win at Atlanta. On the final lap of the 2001 Cracker Barrel Old Country Store 500, he beat Jeff Gordon by [...]006 seconds (the margin being 0.004 of a second closer than Earnhardt had won over Bobby Labonte at the same race a year ago) in an identical photo finish, and the images of Earnhardt's longtime gas man Danny [...] "Chocolate" [...] Myers crying after the victory, Harvick's tire-smoking burnout on the frontstretch with three fingers held aloft outside the driver's window; and the Fox television call by Mike Joy, Larry McReynolds, and Darrell Waltrip concluding with [...] "Just like a year ago , but he [...] is gonna get him though...Gordon got loose... it's Harvick! Harvick by inches!" [...] are memorable to many NASCAR fans. The win was also considered cathartic for a sport whose epicenter <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>ripped</b> away. Harvick would win another race at the inaugural event at Chicagoland en route to a ninth-place finish in the final points, and won Rookie of the Year honors along with the 2001 NASCAR Busch Series Championship.|$|E
