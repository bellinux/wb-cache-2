5|$|Since {{silicon nitride}} ball {{bearings}} are harder than metal, this reduces {{contact with the}} bearing track. This results in 80% less friction, 3 to 10 times longer lifetime, 80% higher speed, 60% less weight, the ability to operate with lubrication starvation, higher corrosion resistance and higher operation temperature, as compared to traditional metal bearings. Silicon nitride balls weigh 79% less than tungsten carbide balls. Silicon nitride ball bearings {{can be found in}} high end automotive bearings, industrial bearings, wind turbines, motorsports, bicycles, rollerblades and skateboards. Silicon nitride bearings are especially useful in applications where corrosion, electric or magnetic fields prohibit the use of metals. For example, in tidal <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> where seawater attack is a problem, or in electric field seekers.|$|E

25|$|Acrylic <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> : Under some {{circumstances}} of high flow rates we may use simple acrylic <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> (0-2.5liters/min) {{to control the}} flow rates through the metabolic chambers. The meters are located upstream from the metabolic chambers. The <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> are simple to use but should be calibrated twice daily {{for use in the}} respirometry system: once before recording begins (but after the animal has been sealed inside the chamber!!) and again {{at the end of the}} recording (before the animal is removed from the chamber). Calibration must be done with a bubble flow meter because the calibration marks on the acrylic meters are only approximate. For proper calibration of flow rates remember that both barometric pressure and temperature of the air streaming through the flow meter (which we assume to be equal to room temperature) must be recorded.|$|E

25|$|A second method called 'continuous blending' is now gaining favor. Oxygen, helium and air are blended on {{the intake}} {{side of a}} compressor. The oxygen and helium are fed into the air stream using <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> so as to achieve the rough mix. The low {{pressure}} mixture is analyzed for oxygen content and the oxygen and helium flows adjusted accordingly. On the high pressure side of the compressor a regulator is used to reduce pressure of a sample flow and the trimix is analyzed (preferably for both helium and oxygen) so that the fine adjustment to the intake gas flows can be made.|$|E

25|$|Mass flow meters: The {{equations}} {{required for}} calculating rates of oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide production {{assume that the}} flow rates {{into and out of}} the chambers are known exactly. We use mass <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> which have the advantage of yielding flow rates independent of temperature and air pressure. Therefore, these flow rates can be considered to be corrected to standard conditions (Standard Temperature Pressure). We only measure and control flow at one location—downstream from the chamber. Therefore, we must assume that the inflow and outflow rates are identical. However, during construction of the respirometry system, flow rate must be measured at all steps, across all connections, to verify integrity of flow.|$|E
