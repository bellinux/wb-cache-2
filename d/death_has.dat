5|$|Commentators {{have offered}} many {{theories}} for {{the origins of}} vampire beliefs, trying to explain the superstition – and sometimes mass hysteria – caused by vampires. Everything ranging from premature burial to the early ignorance of the body's decomposition cycle after <b>death</b> <b>has</b> been cited as the cause for the belief in vampires.|$|E
5|$|<b>Death</b> <b>has</b> {{always been}} a {{critical}} moment for those bereaved, and consequently death is surrounded by taboo-like rules. Family life has to be reorganized {{and in order to}} master such transitions, people use rites. The ceremonies are transitional rites that are intended to give the deceased peace in his or her new situation {{at the same time as}} they provide strength for the bereaved to carry on with their lives.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Professor Simon Brown {{established}} the jack jumper desensitisation program, although {{the program is}} at risk of closure.

5|$|Martin died in {{his sleep}} {{on the night of}} 8 March 2016 at his home in Wiltshire, England, at the age of 90. His death was {{announced}} by Ringo Starr on his Twitter account.

5|$|Oleg's <b>death</b> <b>has</b> been {{interpreted}} as a distorted variant of the threefold death theme in Indo-European myth and legend, with prophecy, the snake and the horse representing the three functions: the prophecy is associated with sovereignty, the horse with warriors, and the serpent with reproduction.|$|E

50|$|Civil {{war in the}} Democratic Republic of the Congo has led to horrific abuses {{against women}} and children, and claimed more than 5.4 million lives. But less than 10 percent of these <b>deaths</b> <b>have</b> {{occurred}} in combat.

5|$|The U.S. National Security Council {{described}} Mattei as an irritation and {{an obstacle}} in a classified report from 1958.

Responsibility for his <b>death</b> <b>has</b> been attributed to the CIA, to the French extreme-nationalist group, the OAS, and to the Sicilian Mafia.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} his <b>death</b> <b>has</b> been debated. Napoleon's physician, François Carlo Antommarchi, led the autopsy, which found {{the cause of death}} to be stomach cancer. Antommarchi did not sign the {{official}} report. Napoleon's father had died of stomach cancer, although this was seemingly unknown {{at the time of the}} autopsy. Antommarchi found evidence of a stomach ulcer; this was the most convenient explanation for the British, who wanted to avoid criticism over their care of Napoleon.|$|E
5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's <b>death</b> <b>has</b> much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E

5|$|Domitian's {{tendency}} towards micromanagement {{was nowhere}} {{more evident than}} in his financial policy. The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus {{at the time of his}} <b>death</b> <b>has</b> been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign. Upon his accession he revalued the Roman currency dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the denarius from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87grams to 3.26grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a devaluation of the silver purity and weight to 93.5% and 3.04grams respectively.|$|E
5|$|In Krishna charitas, Krishna is born to Devaki and her husband, Vasudeva of the Chandravanshi clan. Devaki's {{brother is}} a tyrant named Kamsa. At Devaki's wedding, {{according}} to Puranic legends, Kamsa is told by fortune tellers {{that a child}} of Devaki would kill him. Kamsa arranges to kill all of Devaki's children. When Krishna is born, Vasudeva secretly carries the infant Krishna away across the Yamuna and exchanges him. When Kamsa tries to kill the newborn, the exchanged baby appears as the Hindu goddess Durga, warning him that his <b>death</b> <b>has</b> arrived in his kingdom, and then disappears, according to the legends in the Puranas. Krishna grows up with Nanda and his wife Yasoda near modern-day Mathura. Two of Krishna's siblings also survive, namely Balarama and Subhadra, according to these legends. The day of birth of Krishna is celebrated as Krishna Janmashtami.|$|E
5|$|In a fatal attack, however, it manifests very quickly. In {{a number}} of cases, <b>death</b> <b>has</b> {{occurred}} within 24 hours of {{the onset of the}} infection, while other cases do not last longer than around five days. The virus attacks endothelial cells, rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging; once this reaches the heart, the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock. Symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat, a rapid heartbeat, and decreased blood-cell count, as well as cyanosis of the tongue, mouth ulcers, and oedema of the head and trunk.|$|E

5|$|In archaeology, {{the study}} of {{mortuary}} context, that is, {{the interpretation of the}} postmortem treatment of the dead, whether an individual or as pertains to patterns within a group, has {{led to the development of}} hypotheses on social status and/or hierarchy regarding many cultures, ancient and extant. In addition, the determination of whether or not delivery actually occurred prior to <b>death</b> <b>has</b> a bearing on analyses of the mother's population, as the concentration of trace elements differ markedly between the skeletons of prepartum adult women (before giving birth) and women who are lactating; the identification of coffin birth would lead to more accurate analyses of the number of lactating women in a population or the rate of maternal mortality. It is therefore necessary for investigators to be able to recognize postmortem fetal extrusion when encountered in an excavated burial.|$|E
5|$|Irene Garza (1934 – April 1960) was a South Texas {{teacher and}} beauty queen whose <b>death</b> <b>has</b> {{been the subject}} of {{investigation}} for several decades. Garza was last seen alive on April 16, 1960, when she went to confession at a church in McAllen, Texas. She was reported missing the following morning. Following the largest volunteer search to that date in the Rio Grande Valley, Garza's body was discovered in a canal on April 21. An autopsy concluded that she had been sexually assaulted before being killed; {{the cause of death was}} suffocation.|$|E
5|$|Markway {{wishes to}} study the {{reported}} paranormal activity at Hill House. He secures a lease from Mrs. Sanderson to occupy the mansion {{for the duration of}} his investigation; conditional to his acceptance is that he take Luke Sanderson, her heir, with him. Markway has chosen two individuals to accompany him—a psychic, Theodora, also known as Theo, and the meek Eleanor Lance, who experienced poltergeist activity as a child. Eleanor spent her adult life caring for her invalid mother, whose recent <b>death</b> <b>has</b> left Eleanor with severe guilt.|$|E
