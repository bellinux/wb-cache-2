5|$|Glassmakers {{throughout}} history have experimented with <b>glass</b> <b>fibers,</b> but mass {{manufacture of glass}} fiber was only made possible with the invention of finer machine tooling. In 1893, Edward Drummond Libbey exhibited a dress at the World's Columbian Exposition incorporating <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> with the diameter and texture of silk fibers. <b>Glass</b> <b>fibers</b> can also occur naturally, as Pele's hair.|$|E
5|$|Fiberglass is a fiber {{reinforced}} polymer made {{of plastic}} reinforced by <b>glass</b> <b>fibers,</b> commonly woven into a mat. The <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase {{the strength of the}} glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica, which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make <b>glass</b> <b>fibers.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>fibers</b> {{are useful}} thermal {{insulators}} {{because of their}} high ratio of surface area to weight. However, the increased surface area makes them much more susceptible to chemical attack. By trapping air within them, blocks of glass fiber make good thermal insulation, with a thermal conductivity {{of the order of}} 0.05 W/(m·K).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Glass</b> <b>Fiber</b> segment {{engages in}} the {{production}} and sale of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> and <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> products, such as roving, <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> mats, electronic yarn, chopped strands, and woven roving.|$|R
30|$|In term of {{mechanical}} properties, the {{modulus of elasticity}} of R <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> is higher than E <b>glass</b> <b>fiber,</b> which means R <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced DWZ epoxy resin composites is more sensitive to stress concentration than E <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced DWZ epoxy resin composites.|$|R
30|$|In superconducting Tokamak, <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> {{reinforced}} {{epoxy resin}} composites {{can be used}} to develop isolators, which were used to convey coolant and insulate the cooling pipes in superconducting magnets system. However, manufacturing process has great effect on the properties of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced epoxy resin composites. To reveal the influence of different winding process parameters on the density, void ratio and thermal shrinkage rate of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced epoxy resin composites, five insulation tube specimens were manufactured with R <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced DWZ epoxy resin composites involving different winding process parameters, such as <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> pattern, <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> geometry, <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> angle, curing temperature and curing time.|$|R
5|$|Glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) is a {{composite}} material or fiber-reinforced plastic made of a plastic reinforced by fine <b>glass</b> <b>fibers.</b> Like graphite-reinforced plastic, the composite material is {{commonly referred to as}} fiberglass. The glass can be {{in the form of a}} chopped strand mat (CSM) or a woven fabric.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other {{composite}} materials (such as reinforced concrete), the two materials act together, each overcoming the deficits of the other. Whereas the plastic resins are strong in compressive loading and relatively weak in tensile strength, the <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression. By combining the two materials, GRP becomes a material that resists both compressive and tensile forces well. The two materials may be used uniformly or the glass may be specifically placed in those portions of the structure that will experience tensile loads.|$|E
5|$|The major global industrial-scale use {{of boron}} {{compounds}} (about 46% of end-use) is in production of glass fiber for boron-containing insulating and structural fiberglasses, especially in Asia. Boron {{is added to}} the glass as borax pentahydrate or boron oxide, to influence the strength or fluxing qualities of the <b>glass</b> <b>fibers.</b> Another 10% of global boron production is for borosilicate glass as used in high strength glassware. About 15% of global boron is used in boron ceramics, including super-hard materials discussed below. Agriculture consumes 11% of global boron production, and bleaches and detergents about 6%.|$|E
30|$|The mass {{contents}} of fiber of the insulation tube wounded by <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> filament and <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> tape are 70 – 75  % and almost 59  % respectively. The volume {{contents of}} fiber of the insulation tube wounded by <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> filament and <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> tape are almost 55  % and almost 39  %. Obviously, the mass content and volume content of fiber of the insulation tube wounded by <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> tape are lower.|$|R
30|$|The {{density of}} the {{insulation}} tube wound by using <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> tape is lower than that using <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> filament winding, which corresponds to the resin content of insulation tube wound by using <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> tape is higher. However, higher resin content will lead to high void and bad properties. Therefore, to obtain higher properties of composite made from R <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> and DWZ cryogenic epoxy resin system, {{it is necessary to}} wind the insulation tube of isolators for superconducting Tokamak by using <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> filament and the appropriate winding angle.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of poplar scrimber reinforced with <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> mesh were investigated. The {{influence of the}} different structures and densities were studied {{with respect to the}} modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), and impact toughness (IT). The <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> improved the {{mechanical properties}} of poplar scrimber. The MOR, MOE, and IT of the scrimber had an obvious dependence on the number of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> layers. When the layers of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> meshes were increased, the MOR, MOE, and IT were increased compared to the control group (scrimber without <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforcement). The MOR, MOE, and IT of single-layer <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced scrimber increased a lot compared to the control group. The MOR, MOE, and IT of double-layer <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced scrimber (DGRS) were increased, but the amplitude of the increase was smaller than that of SGRS. Compared to the MOR, MOE, and IT of DGRS, the MOR, MOE, and IT of triple-layer <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced scrimber (TGRS) decreased slightly. When the density was increased, the increasing rate of the MOR, MOE, and IT of the <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced scrimber showed a downward trend, and the <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> had better strengthen effects on the scrimber at low density (0. 6 g/cm 3 and 0. 7 g/cm 3).

5|$|The modern {{method for}} {{producing}} glass wool is {{the invention of}} Games Slayter working at the Owens-Illinois Glass Co. (Toledo, Ohio). He first applied for a patent for a new process to make glass wool in 1933. The first commercial production of glass fiber was in 1936. In 1938 Owens-Illinois Glass Company and Corning Glass Works joined to form the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation. When the two companies joined to produce and promote glass fiber, they introduced continuous filament <b>glass</b> <b>fibers.</b> Owens-Corning is still the major glass-fiber producer in the market today.|$|E
25|$|Plastic {{optical fibers}} (POF) are {{commonly}} step-index multi-mode fibers with a core diameter of 0.5 millimeters or larger. POF typically have higher attenuation coefficients than <b>glass</b> <b>fibers,</b> 1dB/m or higher, and this high attenuation limits {{the range of}} POF-based systems.|$|E
25|$|The circuitboard {{substrates}} {{are usually}} dielectric composite materials. The composites contain a matrix (usually an epoxy resin), a reinforcement (usually a woven, sometimes nonwoven, <b>glass</b> <b>fibers,</b> sometimes even paper), {{and in some}} cases a filler is added to the resin (e.g. ceramics; titanate ceramics can be used to increase the dielectric constant).|$|E

40|$|Abstract- <b>Glass</b> <b>Fiber</b> {{composites}} {{are considered}} to have potential use as a reinforcing material in epoxy polymer based composites because of their good strength, stiffness etc., in present study, mechanical properties for <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> composites were evaluated. Here, <b>Glass</b> <b>fiber</b> is the fiber reinforcement and epoxy polymer resin as a matrix material.

5|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>fiber</b> has {{increased}} in popularity since the discovery that asbestos causes cancer and its subsequent removal from most products. However, the safety of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> is also being called into question, as {{research shows that the}} composition of this material (asbestos and <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> are both silicate fibers) can cause similar toxicity as asbestos.|$|R
25|$|Concrete {{is strong}} in compression, as the {{aggregate}} efficiently carries the compression load. However, it is weak in tension as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack, allowing the structure to fail. Reinforced concrete adds either steel reinforcing bars, steel fibers, <b>glass</b> <b>fibers,</b> or plastic fibers to carry tensile loads.|$|E
25|$|Fiberglass (also called glass-reinforced-plastic) is a {{composite}} material made up of <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> (also called fiberglass or glass friller) embedded in a plastic resin. It is made by melting glass and stretching the glass into fibers. These fibers are woven together into a cloth and left to set in a plastic resin.|$|E
25|$|The plaster is not pure plaster of Paris, {{but rather}} has {{additives}} to improve green strength, dry strength, permeability, and castability. For instance, talc or magnesium oxide {{are added to}} prevent cracking and reduce setting time; lime and cement limit expansion during baking; <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> increase strength; sand {{can be used as}} a filler. The ratio of ingredients is 70–80% gypsum and 20–30% additives.|$|E
30|$|The <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> {{reinforced}} {{epoxy resin}} composites {{play an important}} role in superconducting Tokamak, which are used to insulate the metal components, such as superconducting winding, cooling pipes, metal electrodes and so on. For the components made of metal and <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced epoxy resin composites, thermal shrinkage leads to non-ignorable thermal stress, therefore, much attention should be paid on the thermal shrinkage rate of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced epoxy resin composites. The structural design of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced epoxy resin composites should aim at reducing thermal stress. In this paper, the density, <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> content and thermal shrinkage rate of five insulation tubes were tested. The testing results will be applied in structural design and mechanical analysis of isolators for superconducting Tokamak.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we report}} the {{potential}} use of novel carbon nanofibers (CNFs), dispersed during fabrication of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> composites to monitor damage propagation under static loading. The use of CNFs enables {{a transformation of}} the typically non-conductive <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> composites into new fiber composites with appreciable electrical conductivity. The percolation limit of CNFs/epoxy nanocomposites was first quantified. The electromechanical responses of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> composites fabricated using CNFs/epoxy nanocomposite were examined under static tension loads. The experimental observations showed a nonlinear change of electrical conductivity of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> composites incorporating CNFs versus the stress level under static load. Microstructural investigations proved the ability of CNFs to alter the polymer matrix and to produce a new polymer nanocomposite with a connected nanofiber network with improved electrical properties and different mechanical properties compared with the neat epoxy. It is concluded that incorporating CNFs during fabrication of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> composites can provide an innovative means of self-sensing that will allow damage propagation to be monitored in <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> composites...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{composition}} <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> non dental on water solubility of fiber reinforced composites. E <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> dental {{is one of}} the most used dental fibers in several applications in the dental  field. However, the available of E <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> dental in Indonesia is very limited. A variety of types of non-dental <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> material is easily found as the materials engineering. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of composition non dental <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> on the component solubility of FRC. The materials used in the research was E <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> dental (Fiber splint, Polydentia SA, Switzerland), composition A non-dental <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> (LT, China), composition B (CMAX, China), composition C (HJ, China), flowable composite (Charmfill Flow, Denkist, Korea) and silane coupling agent (Monobond S, Ivoclair Vivadent, Liechtenstein). The subject was divided into 4 groups. Component solubility test was based on the ISO 4049. The result was then analyzed with one way ANOVA (α= 0, 05). The result of the research showed that on the average percentage of the solubility (%), the lowest was on the group of E <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> dental (0. 476 ± 0. 03) and the highest was on the non dental <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> C (0. 600 ± 0. 01).

25|$|Fiber optic {{coatings}} {{protect the}} <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> from scratches {{that could lead}} to strength degradation. The combination of moisture and scratches accelerates the aging and deterioration of fiber strength. When fiber is subjected to low stresses over a long period, fiber fatigue can occur. Over time or in extreme conditions, these factors combine to cause microscopic flaws in the glass fiber to propagate, which can ultimately result in fiber failure.|$|E
25|$|Separators have to {{physically}} {{separate the two}} electrodes to prevent a short circuit by direct contact. It can be very thin (a few hundredths of a millimeter) and must be very porous to the conducting ions to minimize ESR. Furthermore, separators must be chemically inert to protect the electrolyte's stability and conductivity. Inexpensive components use open capacitor papers. More sophisticated designs use nonwoven porous polymeric films like polyacrylonitrile or Kapton, woven <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> or porous woven ceramic fibres.|$|E
25|$|Materials {{that are}} {{typically}} {{used for the}} rotor blades in wind turbines are composites, as {{they tend to have}} a high stiffness, high strength, high fatigue resistance, and low weight. Typical resins used for these composites include polyester and epoxy, while glass and carbon fibers have been used for the reinforcing material. Construction may use manual layup techniques or composite resin injection molding. As the price of <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> is only about one tenth the price of carbon fiber, glass fiber is still dominant.|$|E

25|$|As New York City's World Trade Center {{collapsed}} {{following the}} September 11 attacks, Lower Manhattan was blanketed {{in a mixture}} of building debris and combustible materials. This complex mixture gave rise to the concern that thousands of residents and workers in the area would be exposed to known hazards in the air and in the dust, such as asbestos, lead, <b>glass</b> <b>fibers,</b> and pulverized concrete. More than 1,000 tons of asbestos are thought to have been released into the air following the buildings' destruction. Inhalation of a mixture of asbestos and other toxicants is thought to be linked to the unusually high death rate from cancer of emergency service workers since the disaster. Thousands more are now thought to be at risk of developing cancer due to this exposure with those who have died so far being only the 'tip of the iceberg'. Some commentators have criticised authorities for using asbestos in the buildings' construction.|$|E
