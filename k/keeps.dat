5|$|During the 10th century, a {{small number}} of stone <b>keeps</b> began to be built in France, such at the Château de Langeais: in the 11th century, their numbers {{increased}} as the style spread through Normandy across the rest of France and into England. Some existing motte-and-bailey castles were converted to stone, with the keep amongst usually the first parts to be upgraded, while in other cases new <b>keeps</b> were built from scratch in stone. These stone <b>keeps</b> were introduced into Ireland during the 1170s following the Norman occupation of the east of the country, where they were particularly popular amongst the new Anglo-Norman lords. Two broad types of design emerged across France and England during the period: four-sided stone <b>keeps,</b> known as Norman <b>keeps</b> or great <b>keeps</b> in English – a donjon carré or donjon roman in French – and circular shell <b>keeps.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 12th century, {{new designs}} {{began to be}} {{introduced}} – in France, quatrefoil-shaped <b>keeps</b> were introduced, while in England polygonal towers were built. By {{the end of the}} century, French and English keep designs began to diverge: Philip II of France built a sequence of circular <b>keeps</b> as part of his bid to stamp his royal authority on his new territories, while in England castles were built without <b>keeps.</b> In Spain, <b>keeps</b> were increasingly incorporated into both Christian and Islamic castles, although in Germany tall towers called Bergfriede were preferred to <b>keeps</b> in the western fashion. In {{the second half of the}} 14th century, there was a resurgence in the building of <b>keeps.</b> In France, the keep at Vincennes began a fashion for tall, heavily machicolated designs, a trend adopted in Spain most prominently through the Valladolid school of Spanish castle design. Meanwhile, tower <b>keeps</b> in England became popular amongst the most wealthy nobles: these large <b>keeps,</b> each uniquely designed, formed part of the grandest castles built during the period.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} academic {{discussion of the}} extent to which Norman <b>keeps</b> were designed with a military or political function in mind, particularly in England. Earlier analyses of Norman <b>keeps</b> focused on their military design, and historians such as R. Brown Cathcart King proposed that square <b>keeps</b> were adopted because of their military superiority over timber <b>keeps.</b> Most of these Norman <b>keeps</b> were certainly extremely physically robust, even though the characteristic pilaster buttresses added little real architectural strength to the design. Many of the weaknesses inherent to their design were irrelevant during the early part of their history. The corners of square <b>keeps</b> were theoretically vulnerable to siege engines and galleried mining, but before the introduction of the trebuchet at the end of the 12th century, early artillery stood little practical chance of damaging the <b>keeps,</b> and galleried mining was rarely practised. Similarly, the corners of a square keep created dead space that defenders could not fire at, but missile fire in castle sieges was less important until the introduction of the crossbow in the middle of the 12th century, when arrowslits began to be introduced.|$|E

5|$|A keep (from the Middle English kype) {{is a type}} of {{fortified}} tower built within castles {{during the}} Middle Ages by European nobility. Scholars have debated the scope of the word keep, but usually consider it to refer to large towers in castles that were fortified residences, used as a refuge of last resort should the rest of the castle fall to an adversary. The first <b>keeps</b> were made of timber and formed {{a key part of the}} motte-and-bailey castles that emerged in Normandy and Anjou during the 10th century; the design spread to England as a result of the Norman invasion of 1066, and in turn spread into Wales during the second half of the 11th century and into Ireland in the 1170s. The Anglo-Normans and French rulers began to build stone <b>keeps</b> during the 10th and 11th centuries; these included Norman <b>keeps,</b> with a square or rectangular design, and circular shell <b>keeps.</b> Stone <b>keeps</b> carried considerable political as well as military importance and could take up to a decade to build.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 12th century, a range of new keep designs began to appear across France and England, {{breaking}} the previous unity of the regional designs. The use of <b>keeps</b> in castles spread through Iberia, but some new castles never incorporated <b>keeps</b> in their designs. One traditional explanation for these developments emphasises the military utility of the new approaches, arguing, for example, that the curved surfaces of the new <b>keeps</b> helped to deflect attacks, or that they drew on lessons learnt during the Crusades from Islamic practices in the Levant. More recent historical analysis, however, has emphasised the political and social drivers that underlay these mid-medieval changes in keep design.|$|E
5|$|In the 1190s, {{however, the}} {{struggle}} for power in France began to swing in favour of Philip II, culminating in the Capetian capture of Normandy in 1204. Philip II started to construct completely circular <b>keeps,</b> such as the Tour Jeanne d'Arc, with most built in his newly acquired territories. The first of Philip's new <b>keeps</b> was begun at the Louvre in 1190 and at least another twenty followed, all built to a consistent standard and cost. The architectural idea of circular <b>keeps</b> {{may have come from}} Catalonia, where circular towers in castles formed a local tradition, and probably carried some military advantages, but Philip's intention in building these new <b>keeps</b> in a fresh style was clearly political, an attempt to demonstrate his new power and authority over his extended territories. As historian Philippe Durand suggests, these <b>keeps</b> provided military security and were a physical representation of the renouveau capétien, or Capetian renewal.|$|E

5|$|Keep {{design in}} England {{began to change}} only {{towards the end of}} the 12th century, later than in France. Wooden <b>keeps</b> on mottes ceased to be built across most of England by the 1150s, {{although}} they continued to be erected in Wales and along the Welsh Marches. By the end of the 12th century, England and Ireland saw a handful of innovative angular or polygonal <b>keeps</b> built, including the keep at Orford Castle, with three rectangular, clasping towers built out from the high, circular central tower; the cross-shaped keep of Trim Castle and the famous polygonal design at Conisborough. Despite these new designs, square <b>keeps</b> remained popular across much of England and, as late as the 1170s, square Norman great <b>keeps</b> were being built at Newcastle. Circular keep designs similar to those in France really became popular in Britain in the Welsh Marches and Scotland for only a short period during the early 13th century.|$|E
5|$|Norman <b>keeps</b> {{had four}} sides, with the corners {{reinforced}} by pilaster buttresses; some <b>keeps,</b> particularly in Normandy and France, had a barlongue design, being rectangular in plan with their length twice their width, while others, particularly in England, formed a square. These <b>keeps</b> could {{be up to}} four storeys high, with the entrance placed on the first storey to prevent the door from being easily broken down; early French <b>keeps</b> had external stairs in wood, whilst later castles in both France and England built them in stone. In some cases the entrance stairs were protected by additional walls and a door, producing a forebuilding. The strength of the Norman design typically came from {{the thickness of the}} keep's walls: usually made of rag-stone, these could be up to 24 feet (7.3 metres) thick, immensely strong, and producing a steady temperature inside the building throughout summer and winter. The larger <b>keeps</b> were subdivided by an internal wall while the smaller versions had a single, slightly cramped chamber on each floor. Usually only the first floor would be vaulted in stone, with the higher storeys supported with timbers.|$|E

5|$|The French model {{spread into}} Iberia {{in the second}} half of the century, where the most {{powerful}} nobles in Castile built a number of similar tall <b>keeps,</b> such as that at Peñafiel, taking advantage of the weakness of the Castilian Crown during the period. Henry IV of Castile responded in the 15th century by creating a sequence of royal castles with prominent <b>keeps</b> at the Castle of La Mota, Portillo, and Alcázar of Segovia: built to particular proportions, these <b>keeps</b> became known as a key element of the Valladolid school of Spanish castle design. Smaller versions of these <b>keeps</b> were subsequently built by many aspiring new aristocracy in Spain, including many converted Jews, keen to improve their social prestige and position in society. The French model of tall <b>keeps</b> was also echoed in some German castles, such as that at Karlštejn, although the layout and positioning of these towers still followed the existing bergfried model, rather than that in western castles.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{transition}} from timber to stone <b>keeps</b> are unclear, and the process was slow and uneven, taking many years to take effect across the various regions. Traditionally {{it was believed that}} stone <b>keeps</b> had been adopted because of the cruder nature of wooden buildings, the limited lifespan of wooden fortifications and their vulnerability to fire; recent archaeological studies have however shown that many wooden castles were as robust and as sophisticated as their stone equivalents. Some wooden <b>keeps</b> were not converted into stone for many years and were instead expanded in wood, such as at Hen Domen. Nonetheless, stone became increasingly popular as a building material for <b>keeps</b> for both military and symbolic reasons.|$|E

5|$|As the 16th century progressed, <b>keeps</b> {{fell out}} of fashion once again. In England, the {{gatehouse}} also began to supplant the keep as the key focus for a new castle development. By the 15th century, it was increasingly unusual for a lord to build both a keep and a large gatehouse at the same castle, and by the early 16th century, the gatehouse had easily overtaken the keep as the more fashionable feature: indeed, almost no new <b>keeps</b> were built in England after this period. The classical Palladian style began to dominate European architecture during the 17th century, causing a further {{move away from the}} use of <b>keeps.</b> Buildings in this style usually required considerable space for the enfiladed formal rooms that became essential for modern palaces {{by the middle of the}} century, and this style was impossible to fit into a traditional keep. The keep at Bolsover Castle in England was one of the few to be built as part of a Palladian design.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as these <b>keeps</b> were being built by the {{extremely}} wealthy, much smaller, keep-like structures called tower houses or peel towers were built across Ireland, Scotland, and northern England, often by relatively poorer local lords and landowners. It was originally argued that Irish tower houses were based on the Scottish design, but the pattern of development of such castles in Ireland does not support this hypothesis. A tower house would typically be a tall, square, stone-built, crenelated building; Scottish and Ulster tower houses were often also surrounded by a barmkyn or bawn wall. Most academics have concluded that tower houses should not be classified as <b>keeps</b> but rather as a form of fortified house.|$|E

5|$|By contrast, the {{remainder}} of Europe saw stone towers being used in castles, {{but not in a}} way that fulfilled the range of functions seen in the western European <b>keeps.</b> In the Low Countries, it became popular for the local nobility to build stand-alone, square towers, but rarely as part of a wider castle. Similarly, square stone towers became popular in Venice, but these did not fulfil the same role as western <b>keeps.</b> In Germany, rectangular stone castles began to replace motte-and-bailey castles from the 12th century onwards. These designs included stone versions of the traditional Bergfriede, which still remained distinct from the domestic <b>keeps</b> used in more western parts of Europe, with the occasional notable exception, such as the large, residential Bergfried at Eltville Castle.|$|E
