Several risk factors including age, gender, body mass index and quadriceps muscle strength may contribute to knee osteoarthritis. Quadriceps muscle is the dynamic stabilizer of the knee. Besides the studies arguing that quadriceps muscle weakness might lead to knee osteoarthritis, there are also studies suggesting that muscle weakness might occur due to knee osteoarthritis. Authors, arguing that quadriceps muscle weakness has a deteriorating affect on knee osteoarthritis, also come to a conclusion that strengthening this muscle has a beneficial effect on knee osteoarthritis.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Cardiopathies are the world's {{leading cause}} of {{mortality}} and morbidity. Although rare, cardiovascular accidents can occur during intense and infrequent sporting activity, particularly {{among those who are}} unaware of their heart condition. The development of cardiospecific biochemical markers has led to a reconsideration of the role of biology in the diagnosis of cardiovascular illnesses. The aim of this study therefore was, through the use of cardiac biomarker assays, to highlight the impact of sustained physical effort in the form of intense and prolonged concentric <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> and to research potential cardiovascular risks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen subjects participated in a maximal concentric <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> involving 30 knee flexion-extensions for each leg. Five blood tests were taken to study the kinetics of the cardiac biomarkers. Haemodynamic parameters were measured continuously using a Portapres, and respiratory parameters were measured using a Sensormedics Vmax 29 C. RESULTS: The results showed significant increases in the creatine kinase, myoglobin, homocysteine and haemoglobin cardiac markers. Evolutionary trends were also observed for the following biomarkers: NT-proBNP, myeloperoxydase and C-reactive protein. All the physiological parameters measured presented statistically significant changes. CONCLUSION: Isokinetic effort leads to the release of cardiac markers in the blood, but these do not exceed the reference values in healthy subjects. Maximal concentric <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> does not, therefore, lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular pathologies. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Knee {{replacement}} often {{improves the}} quality of life for those patients with protracted pain. Particularly patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid disorders or those with threatened walking ability receive a new knee. Surgical results are often very good, certainly from the aspect of pain relief, but many patients live with permanent power deficits and disabilities in their new joint. Active rehabilitation for these patients is a deliberated theme and shows good results. Early strength training, on the other hand, is not jet established. <b>Isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> for these patients means an isolated training of the thigh muscles at a constant speed. The method allows training of the knee muscles in extension and flexion without overloading the joint. The aim of this study is to investigate the utility of active rehabilitation with isokinetic training for patients with a recently operated knee replacement. The study analyses 7 patients who have chosen to be rehabilitated at a clinic where <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> is a part of the treatment. In addition to this, the patients performed aqua jogging, cycling, stair walking and lymphatic drainage. Mobility Measurements, pain assessment and power tests examined at the beginning and end out of the study. The patients improved their mobility of the knee joint and decreased pain perception during the study. The power of the thigh muscles increased during the study. The pain assessments in the knee joint decreased. This study indicates that active rehabilitation with <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> may promote rehabilitation for knee replacement patients.

The carbohydrate restriction program consisted of 60 minutes of cycling at 75 % of peak cycle ergometer oxygen consumption (PVO 2), followed by four 1 -minute bouts at 100 % of PVO 2, followed by 2 days of reduced carbohydrate intake (1. 2 +/- 0. 5 g. kg(- 1). d(- 1)). Isoinertial strength exercise was three sets of squats with a load of 80 % of one repetition maximum. <b>Isokinetic</b> strength <b>exercise</b> was five repetitions of leg extensions performed at five different contractile speeds (1. 05, 2. 09, 3. 14, 4. 19, and 5. 24 rad. s(- 1)).

40|$|Background: Obesity is {{associated}} with osteoarthritis and it is accompanied by chronic inflammation and elevated oxidative stress. Strengthening-type exercise is used in knee osteoarthritis (KOA) rehabilitation. This study determined how acute <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> influences inflammatory responses of obese middle-aged women with KOA. Methods: Ten obese women with KOA and 10 age/weight-matched controls performed an <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> protocol. Assessment of performance (knee extensor/flexor torque), muscle soreness (DOMS), knee flexibility (KJRM), and pain, and blood collection were performed pre-exercise, post-exercise, and at 24 h post-exercise. Blood was analyzed for creatine kinase activity (CK), lactate dehydrogenase activity (LDH), CRP, leukocytes, uric acid, IL- 6, TBARS, lipid hydroperoxides (LPX), protein carbonyls (PC), oxidized (GSH) and reduced glutathione (GSSG), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), catalase activity, and glutathione peroxidase activity (GPX). Results: Physical function remained unaltered by exercise (only torque at 90 degrees/s decreased at 24 h). Exercise increased DOMS throughout recovery but KJRM and pain remained unchanged. CK, LDH, and uric acid increased similarly in both groups. CRP remained unaffected by exercise while IL- 6 increased only post-exercise. TBARS, PC, LPH, GSSG, and TAC increased only post-exercise in both groups. GSH and GSH/GSSG declined post-exercise and normalized thereafter. Catalase and GPX increased only in patients post-exercise. Conclusion: <b>Isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> induces only a mild inflammatory response of very short duration (< 24 h) without affecting physical function and pain in KOA patients suggesting that moderate strengthening-type exercise may be safe for this patient cohort.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Regular {{physical}} activity {{is an important}} health factor, but intense physical stress can {{increase the risk of}} heart disease. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine the potential cardiac repercussions of, and the oxidative stress resulting from a maximal eccentric <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> and a 1 -hour treadmill run at 75 % ˙V O 2 max (maximal exercise done 6 weeks before). METHODS: Twelve young sedentary healthy subjects randomly performed two tests separated by 6 weeks: 1) 3 sets of 30 maximal eccentric isokinetic contractions of the quadriceps; 2) a 1 -hour running on treadmill at 75 % ˙V O 2 max. We drew blood samples just before each exercise (T 1), and just after (T 2), 3 hours after (T 3), and 24 hours after (T 4) the end of each exercise to measure cardiac and oxidative stress biomarkers. RESULTS: In the running group, we observed significant differences for myoglobin (T 3 : 145 ± 80 μg/L), creatinine kinase (T 4 : 593 ± 350 mg/L), oxidized glutathione (T 2 : 22 ± 15. 6 μmol/L), and highly sensitive cardiac troponin T, (T 3 : 0. 051 ± 0. 038 ng/mL). In the isokinetic group, we observed significant differences for myoglobin (T 3 : 1419 ± 2533 mg/L), creatine kinase (3303 ± 7159 mg/L), and oxidized glutathione (T 4 : 24 ± 14 μmol/L). Between <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> and running, we observed significant differences for uric acid (p eccentric), myoglobin (p < 0. 05, ditto), NT-proBNP (p < 0. 05, ditto), hsTnT (p < 0. 01, ditto), and oxidized glutathione (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: As cardiac biomarkers appear practically unmodified after the <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise,</b> despite the considerable oxidative stress, we suggest that the application of intense maximal eccentric <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise,</b> when indicated, should be safe for most patients including those whose cardiac status is unknown. On the other hand, the increase in cardiac biomarkers observed after running, could reflect leakage of these biomarkers from the cytosolic pool of cardiac cells, linked to membrane damage, rather than the result of a major injury and hence running {{is supposed to be a}} safe practice. However, since sudden death during running has been previously described, assesment of the cardiac biomarkers and a follow-up by a sport doctor is important especially if there is a cardiac family history.

The {{purpose of this study}} is toinvestigate the difference in bilateral midback and low-back paraspinal muscle(PSM) activities during performance of different resistance isokineticexercises in healthy subjects and those with scoliosis. Methods: Forty-one healthy subjects and thirty-three subjects with adolescent idiopathicscoliosis (AIS) were enrolled. An isokinetic back system in combinationwith quantitative surface EMG was used to evaluate the dominant and nondominantPSM activities by analyzing the root mean square (RMS) duringisokinetic extension and flexion exercise at velocities of 30 °/s and 90 °/s. Results: Significantly higher RMS of EMG were found in the dominant medial andlateral PSM of the lumbar region than the non-dominant muscles in thehealthy control group and in those with AIS with smaller curves (< 20 degrees) during isokinetic flexion and extension exercises.

Twenty-four young healthy men performed 120 maximal voluntary eccentric actions at each thigh's quadriceps muscle at an angular velocity of 60 °. s - 1. The participants were then randomly divided into 2 equal groups, 1 of which exercised 24 hours later, while the other group rested. Muscle damage indicators (i. e., serum creatine kinase, delayed onset muscle soreness, and eccentric, concentric, and isometric peak torque) and running economy indicators (i. e., oxygen consumption, pulmonary ventilation, respiratory exchange ratio, respiratory rate, and heart rate during treadmill running at 2. 2 and 3. 3 m·s- 1) were assessed prior to and 48 hours following the eccentric exercise. All muscle damage indicators changed significantly in both groups (p < 0. 05) in a way suggestive of considerable muscle damage.

30|$|In {{the current}} study, we tested a {{prototype}} of an <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> device for the lower limbs. The proposed device involves a type of single-limb squat, which applies a translational load on the swing leg in the closed kinetic chain (CKC) style, placing load by the body weight on {{the muscles of the}} stance leg in the standing position. We refer to this training style as a resistive leg reach exercise [3]. This type of training applies load to the gluteal muscles, and is effective for preventing knee valgus moment, a major factor in ACL injuries. The primary goal of this style of training is to rehabilitate and/or preserve the ACL, and to provide a useful method for athletic strength training. To enhance the quality of the load used in this type of exercise, we have developed an electro-rheological <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> device prototype, called the “ERIK” [4 – 6]. The ERIK includes an electro-rheological (ER) fluid brake system, which provides apparent viscosity that can be reversibly controlled by varying the applied voltage. In the current study, we tested the ERIK to verify its performance through reproducible experiments using a servomotor, in contrast with previous studies using only a basic control. Moreover, several new training modes were also tested, including the initial resistance mode and the terminal resistance mode.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{isokinetic}} measurement of strength was originally related by Hislop and Perrine. (1) Characteristics of an isokinetic exertion are constant velocity throughout a predetermined range of motion. Strictly speaking, {{a means of}} speed control, and not a load in the usual sense, is applied in isokinetic exertions. (1) However, load and resistance are definitely present in this technique. In this case, the load {{is a result of}} the energy absorption process performed by the device to keep the exertion speed constant. The device prevents energy from being dissipated through acceleration in <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise.</b> The energy is instead converted into a resistive force, which varies in relation to the efficiency of the skeletal muscle. Since the speed of motion is held constant in <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise,</b> the resistance experienced during a contraction is equivalent to the force applied throughout the range of motion. For this reason, the technique of <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> has sometimes been referred to as accommodating resistance exercise. This type of exercise allows the muscle to contract at its maximum capability a tall points throughout the range of motion. At the extremes of the range of motion of a joint, the muscle has the least mechanical advantage, and the resistance offered by the machine is correspondingly lower. Similarly, as the muscle reaches its optimal mechanical advantage, the resistance of the machine increases proportionally. It must be understood, however, that while isokinetic devices control the speed of the exertion, this does not assure a constant speed of muscle contraction. The speed of isokinetic contractions is constant during individual exertions; however, it is also possible to compare muscular performance over a wide range of isokinetic velocities. Increasing the isokinetic speed of contraction will place increasing demands on Type II muscle fibers (fast twitch and fast oxidative glycolytic). Workplace Assessment It is clear that isometric strength testing cannot substitute for dynamic strength assessment when examining highly dynamic occupational job demands. As most industrial work tasks contain a significant dynamic component, analysis of isokinetic strength capabilities appears to offer some advantage to isometric testing in this regard. However, it must be recognized that isokinetic devices are not entirely realistic compared with free dynamic lifting in which subjects may use rapid acceleration to gain a weight-lifting advantage...|$|E
30|$|A {{change in}} the {{energetics}} pathways to supply the demand of the exercise may also {{have contributed to the}} lack of difference in muscle performance in the hypoxic condition. McLellan et al. (1990) found that a significantly larger increase occurs in the concentration of lactate in the muscle group exercise performed in the hypoxia compared to the normoxia group, suggesting that the inhalation of air with a low oxygen concentration can increase the rate of anaerobic glycolysis. It is possible that the <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> performed by subjects during the hypoxic condition is predominantly anaerobic; in other words that the aerobic contribution is negligible.|$|E

In addition, changes in visual analog scale pain and rates of attrition in each group were also recorded. Results. Patients in groups I–III exhibited increased muscle peak torques and significantly reduced pain and disability after treatment and at followup. Groups II and III showed significant improvements in range of motion and ambulation speed after treatment. Group III also showed the greatest increase in walking speed and decrease in disability after treatment and at followup. Both group II and group III had significant gains in muscular strength after treatment and at followup; group III showed the greatest gains. Conclusion. An integrated therapy deals with the extra- and intraarticular progressive pathologic changes, and kinesi-ologic management of OA is suggested {{for the management of}} knee OA. KEY WORDS.

40|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} available regarding how proprioceptive abilities decline {{as the amount}} of exertion increases during exercise. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the role of different levels of fatigue on knee joint position sense. A repeated measures design was used to examine changes in active joint reposition sense (AJRS) prior to and following three levels of fatigue. Eighteen participants performed knee extension and flexion <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> until torque output was 90 %, 70 %, or 50 % of the peak hamstring torque for three consecutive repetitions. Active joint reposition sense at 15, 30, or 45 degrees was tested following the <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> session. Following testing of the first independent measure, participants were given a 20 minute rest period. Testing procedures were repeated for two more exercise sessions following the other levels of fatigue. Testing of each AJRS test angle was conducted on three separate days with 48 hours between test days. Significant main effect for fatigue was indicated (p = 0. 001). Pairwise comparisons indicated a significant difference between the pre-test and following 90 % of peak hamstring torque (p = 0. 02) and between the pre-test and following 50 % of peak hamstring torque (p = 0. 02). Fatigue has long been theorized to be a contributing factor in decreased proprioceptive acuity, and therefore a contributing factor to joint injury. The findings of the present study indicate that fatigue may have an effect on proprioception following mild and maximum fatigue...|$|E
40|$|Anterior {{knee pain}} (AKP) {{is a common}} {{pathological}} condition, particularly among young people and athletes, associated to an abnormal motion of the patella during the bending of the knee and possibly dependent on a muscular or structural imbalance. A lack of synergy in the quadriceps muscles results in a dynamic misalignment of the patella, which in turn produces pain. AKP rehabilitative therapy consists of conservative treatment whose main objective is to strengthen the Vastus Medialis. The aim {{of this article is}} to study the quadriceps muscle control strategy in AKP patients during an <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise.</b> Analysis of the muscle activation strategy is important for an objective measurement of the knee functionality in that it helps to diagnose and monitor the rehabilitative treatment. Surface electromyography (EMG) from the three superficial muscles of the femoral quadriceps during a concentric <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercise</b> has been analyzed along with the signals of knee joint position and torque. A group of 12 AKP patients has been compared with a group of 30 normal subjects. Analysis of the grand ensemble average of the EMG linear envelopes in AKP patients reveals significant modifications in Vastus Medialis activity compared to the other quadriceps muscles. In order to study the synergy of the muscles, temporal identifiers have been associated to the EMG linear envelopes. To this end, EMG linear envelope decomposition in Gaussian pulses turned out to be effective and the results highlight an appreciable delay in the activation of the Vastus Medialis in AKP patients. This muscular unbalance can explain the abnormal motion of the patella.

40|$|Abstract Background Fatiguing {{exercises}} used across {{studies to}} induce alterations in postural control are diverse and {{may explain the}} different findings reported. This study aimed to compare the effects of two types of fatiguing plantarflexion exercises on postural control on a firm and a compliant surface. Ten healthy young men (29 ± 4 [*]years) were asked to stand as steadily as possible for 30 [*]s, blindfolded with feet together, on a firm and a compliant surface before and immediately after an isometric and an <b>isokinetic</b> fatiguing <b>exercise.</b> Results Maximal force reduction due to fatigue was found significant but similar between exercises. No {{significant difference was found}} between the fatiguing exercises on all Center of Pressure (CoP) parameters. Both fatiguing exercises induced increases in CoP excursion area, CoP variability and CoP velocity in both planes (antero-posterior, mediolateral) on the compliant surface. On the firm surface, both fatiguing exercises only induced increases in CoP variability and CoP velocity in the fatigued plane (antero-posterior). Conclusions Isometric and <b>isokinetic</b> fatiguing <b>exercises,</b> when producing a similar level of force reduction, induce similar decreases in postural control. The effects of fatigue on postural control in healthy young men are more pronounced when standing on a compliant surface, i. e. when proprioceptive information at the ankle is altered. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Authors. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to waterproof a near-infrared spectroscopy device (PortaMon, Artinis Medical Systems) to enable NIR measurement during swim exercise. Candidate materials were initially tested for waterproof suitability by comparing light intensity values during phantom-based tissue assessment. Secondary assessment involved repeated <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercises</b> ensuring reliability of the results obtained from the modified device. Tertiary assessment required analysis of the effect of water immersion and temperature upon device function. Initial testing revealed that merely covering the PortaMon light sources with waterproof materials considerably affected the NIR light intensities. Modifying a commercially available silicone covering through the addition of a polyvinyl chloride material (impermeable to NIR light transmission) produces an acceptable compromise. Bland-Altman analysis indicated that exercise-induced changes in tissue saturation index (TSI %) were within acceptable limits during laboratory exercise. Although water immersion had a small but significant effect upon NIR light intensity, this resulted in a negligible change in the measured TSI (%). We then tested the waterproof device in vivo illustrating oxygenation changes during a 100 m freestyle swim case study. Finally, a full study compared club level swimmers and triathletes. Significant changes in oxygenation profiles when comparing upper and lower extremities for the two groups were revealed, reflecting differences in swim biomechanics...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{reproducibility}} of testing hip abduction and adduction using an isokinetic dynamometer by a novel testing protocol. Design Test-retest design. Setting Biodynamics laboratory. Participants Fifteen healthy subjects (9 men, 6 women; age, 22. 410. 5 y) were recruited. Interventions Two setups were compared: the first according to manufacturer 9 ̆ 2 s guidelines (setup A) {{and the second}} a novel setup incorporating pelvic fixation (setup B). Setups A and B were performed in a random order. Both setups included the same battery of isokinetic (300 /s, 600 /s) and isometric tests, and were repeated 1 week later. Main Outcome Measures The peak torque for each abduction and adduction exercise was noted and pelvic motion during testing was recorded. Results Setup B significantly (P<. 05) reduced transverse pelvic rotation by between 7. 50 and 8. 00 dependent on test speed. Mean differences for reproducibility of peak torque, ranged from 0. 8 to 11. 7 Nm. The coefficients of repeatability of both setups were similar, ranging from 21. 4 to 56. 3 Nm across <b>isokinetic</b> <b>exercises.</b> A similar observation was noted for isometric exercises, with {{the differences between the}} coefficients of repeatability ranging from 18. 6 to 40. 0 Nm. Conclusions Reducing pelvic rotation does not enhance reproducibility of the system and is not related to torque production. Further research is required to determine the optimal test setu...|$|R
