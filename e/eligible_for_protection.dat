500|$|Tourist and {{scientific}} visits to Titanic are still continuing; by April 2012, 100 {{years since the}} disaster and nearly 25 since {{the discovery of the}} wreck, around 140 people had visited. [...] On 14 April 2012 (the 100th anniversary of the ship's sinking), the wreck of the Titanic became <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> <b>protection</b> under the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage. In the same month, Robert Ballard, the wreck's discoverer, announced a plan to preserve the wreck of the Titanic by using deep-sea robots to paint the wreck with anti-fouling paint, to help keep the wreck in its current state for all time. The proposed plan that Ballard announced has been outlined in a documentary made to time with the Titanic's 100th sinking anniversary called Save the Titanic With Bob Ballard where Ballard himself talks about how this proposed paint job on the wreck will work. Ballard says that he proposed to robotically clean and repaint the Titanic with a colour scheme mimicking rusticles because he saw [...] "original anti-fouling paint on the ship's hull, which was still working even after 74 years on the seabed" [...] when he visited the Titanic in 1986.|$|E

2500|$|The summary {{described}} above {{was provided to}} the defense along with a companion summary that defined a [...] "covert" [...] CIA employee as a “CIA employee whose employment is not publicly acknowledged by the CIA or the employee." [...] It is important {{to bear in mind}} that the IIPA defines “covert agent” differently. It states: [...] "The term 'covert agent' means— (A) a present or retired officer or employee of an intelligence agency ... (i) whose identity as such an officer, employee, or member is classified information, and (ii) who is serving outside the United States or has within the last five years served outside the United States." [...] The CIA summary of Ms. Wilson's employment history claims that she [...] "engaged in temporary duty (TDY) travel overseas on official business", though it does not say whether such travel in fact occurred within the last five years. Further, {{it is not clear that}} engaging in temporary duty travel overseas would make a CIA employee who is based in Washington <b>eligible</b> <b>for</b> <b>protection</b> under the IIPA. In fact, it seems more likely that the CIA employee would have to have been stationed outside the United States to trigger the protection of the statute. To our knowledge, the meaning of the phrase [...] "served outside the United States" [...] in the IIPA has never been litigated. Thus, whether Ms. Wilson was covered by the IIPA remains very much in doubt, especially given the sparse nature of the record.|$|E
