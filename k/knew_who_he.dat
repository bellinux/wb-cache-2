5|$|In January 1776, Allen and his {{men were}} put on board HMS Soledad, which sailed for Cork, Ireland. The people of Cork, when they learned that the famous Ethan Allen was in port, took up a {{collection}} to provide him {{and his men}} with clothing and other supplies. Much of the following year was spent on prison ships off the American coast. At one point, while aboard HMS Mercury, she anchored off New York, where, among other visitors, the captain entertained William Tryon; Allen reports that Tryon glanced at him without any sign of recognition, although it is likely the New York governor <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> was. In August 1776, Allen and other prisoners were temporarily put ashore in Halifax, owing to extremely poor conditions aboard ship; due to food scarcity, both crew and prisoners were on short rations, and scurvy was rampant. By the end of October, Allen was again off New York, where the British, having secured the city, moved the prisoners on-shore, and, as he was considered an officer, gave Allen limited parole. With the financial assistance of his brother Ira, he lived comfortably, if out of action, until August 1777. He then learned {{of the death of}} his young son Joseph due to smallpox.|$|E
25|$|For {{a number}} of years, Webern wrote pieces which were freely atonal, much {{in the style of}} Schoenberg's early atonal works. Indeed, so in lockstep with Schoenberg was Webern for much of his artistic {{development}} that Schoenberg in 1951 wrote that he sometimes no longer <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> was, Webern had followed so well in his footsteps and shadow, occasionally outdoing or stepping ahead of Schoenberg in execution of Schoenberg's own or their shared ideas.|$|E
500|$|For years, Al Costello {{had been}} working on an idea for a new tag team; he even <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> wanted for a partner: a wrestler he had worked with some years ago named Roy Heffernan. Because Costello and Heffernan had lost touch over the years, the idea {{remained}} dormant until Costello toured Hawaii in 1956. Costello mentioned his idea of an [...] "Ultra Australian" [...] tag team to fellow wrestler, and future promoter, Joe Blanchard. Blanchard happened to be a good friend of Roy Heffernan and knew he was working in Stampede Wrestling at the time. Blanchard put the two in touch with each other, and Costello was soon off to Calgary, Alberta, Canada to join Heffernan and finally make his tag team a reality. Costello and Heffernan debuted as [...] "The Fabulous Kangaroos" [...] on 3 May 1957 for Stu Hart’s Stampede Wrestling promotion in a match against Maurice LaPointe and Tony Baillargeon. Only weeks after that first match, The Kangaroos were working with the top tag teams in the promotion.|$|E

500|$|Willy {{has always}} {{made the point}} to his sons that being popular and having {{contacts}} {{is the key to}} success. His older son, Biff, causes [...] "old hopes and boiling resentments" [...] to return by visiting home. Willy is loved by Biff, who nonetheless does not get along with him. [...] Their relationship is the emotional lynchpin of the production. “In fact, Willy's logical mind becomes blind…” Biff attempts to help his father see what has become of him. In the end, Biff decides that he must force his father to see the truth rather than his fanciful images, for his own good, regardless of its toll on his father. [...] This is the emotional climax of the show as he bares his soul saying [...] "Pop, I'm nothing! I'm nothing, Pop! Can't you understand that? There's no spite in it any more. I'm just what I am, that's all." [...] At Willy's funeral, Biff states that [...] "He had the wrong dreams...He never <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> was.".|$|E
500|$|Brian Donlevy as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Donlevy reprised {{his role}} as the eponymous professor, much to the despair of Nigel Kneale, who had heavily criticised his {{interpretation}} of the role in The Quatermass Xperiment. As had been the case on The Quatermass Xperiment, Donlevy's alcoholism presented challenges for the production. Nigel Kneale recalled visiting the set one day: “He [...] was so full of whiskey he could hardly stand up. He staggered over to the set and looked dazedly around. They held up an idiot board with his lines on and he said, “What's this movie called?” and they said, “Well, it's called Quatermass 2”. He said, “I've got to say all that? There's too much talk. Cut down some of the talk”. He tried to read it and he had to have go after go after go, so crippled with drink he hardly <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> was”. Val Guest has denied Kneale's claims, saying “So many stories have been concocted since, about how he was a paralytic. It's absolute balls, because he was not paralytic. He wasn't stone cold sober either, but he was a pro and he knew his lines”. Guest also recalled, “By after lunch he would come to me and say “Give me a breakdown of the story so far. Where have I just been before this scene?” We used to feed him black coffee all morning but then we discovered he was lacing it. But he was a very professional actor and very easy to work with”.|$|E
2500|$|While in Europe in 1984, Brock was in {{the unusual}} {{situation}} (for him) of being the second billing in his driver pairing with Perkins. From 1974 until 1977 Larry Perkins had made 11 starts in F1 and, to {{the large number of}} European motoring press covering the two World Endurance Championship races, ex-F1 driver Larry 'Larrikins' Perkins was the star driver with Brock seen as nothing more than a saloon car driver. According to Perkins, [...] "The Porsche exercise at Le Mans was great although PB (Brock) struggled with the 'Euro media' because no one <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> was!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The match {{garnered}} mainstream {{attention from}} media outlets such as ESPN and USA Today. UFC President Dana White credited Shamrock for the show's success. White said, [...] "the reason we {{did so well}} on UFC 40 was because of Ken Shamrock {{and the fact that}} everyone <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> was." [...] Shamrock nearly scored a knockout early in round 1, buckling Ortiz's knees with a punch and dropping him to one knee. However, Ortiz recovered shortly after and went on to dominate the fight with takedowns and ground-and-pound. Right before Round 4 started, Shamrock's cornerman threw in the towel and Ortiz successfully defended the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 24February 1932, when Puyi {{accepted}} the offer to be Chief Executive of Manchukuo, a party was thrown to celebrate with geishas being imported for the celebration, during which Itagaki become very drunk, and forgetting that the geisha are entertainers, not prostitutes, made outrageous sexual advances on the geisha, fondling their breasts and vaginas, telling Puyi that as a general he could do anything he wanted to the geisha. During the party, while Itagaki boasted to Puyi that now was {{a great time to}} be a Japanese man, Puyi was much offended when none of the geisha <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> was.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first film}} {{was based on}} Nebel's Macbride and Kennedy story [...] "No Hard Feelings". The story was later adapted again as the 1941 film A Shot in the Dark. Director Frank MacDonald {{immediately}} <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> wanted {{for the role of}} Torchy Blane. Glenda Farrell had already played hard-boiled reporters in earlier Warner Bros. films, Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933) and Hi, Nellie! (1934). She was quickly cast in the first Torchy Blane movie, Smart Blonde, with Barton MacLane playing detective Steve McBride. Farrell and MacLane would co-star in seven of the nine Torchy Blane films by Warner Bros. Smart Blonde was released on January 2, 1937. The film was a surprise hit and Warner Bros. made eight more movies from 1937 to 1939.|$|E

[...] Alleging that he copied the cover from Nas' {{landmark}} release Illmatic, as well as styles from other rap artists. This generated longstanding controversy over their differences with B.I.G., and in later interviews, both rappers would downplay the incident: [...] "It {{was one of them}} skits where we was looking at our competition. And when Ghost is saying whatever he was saying, we kinda <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> was talking about, but it wasn't like we was trying to start a beef.

Orli tells him that she wanted to, especially as Tali grew but that she feared {{he would not be}} pleased, to which Tony tells her [...] "Then she never knew me at all." [...] Later in the episode, Tony finds a picture of him and Ziva in Paris, to which Tali points to each of them, saying [...] "Ima" [...] and [...] "Abba" [...] indicating that she <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> was, her father.|$|E

2500|$|On April 30, 2015, Kevin Moore, {{one of the}} {{witnesses}} who filmed Gray's arrest, was arrested at gunpoint following what Moore described as [...] "harassment and intimidation" [...] by police. Moore stated he had cooperated with police, and gave over his video of Gray's arrest for investigation. He claimed, despite aiding in the investigation, his photo was made public by police, who asked the public to identify {{him because he was}} [...] "wanted for questioning." [...] Moore said the police obviously <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> was when they posted his photo. Moore was released from custody the next day, but two other individuals who were arrested along with Moore remained in custody. The same day as Moore's arrest, medical examiners reported Gray sustained more injuries as a result of slamming into the inside of the transport van, [...] "apparently breaking his neck; a head injury he sustained matches a bolt {{in the back of the}} van".|$|E

[...] "'Send me the piece, and if I feel able, I'll do it.' I don't have any hobbies, you know. I love music; I do it [...] And he said, 'Oh, thank you, Mr. Parks. We will destroy the world.' I said, 'Okay...' I Google him and there he is, on YouTube, in front of 30,000 people, pouring beer onto a laptop computer, {{at which point the}} crowd jumps into the mosh pit and has an erection.…I have two things I can do: Run away from all this in horror because I’m so superior, or dig in and serve and try to bring hope to the hopeless. That can be done behind the curtain, and that’s where I’m very comfortable working.…I treat every job {{as if it were the}} very thing that will define me. Nothing is beneath me. I think that is evident to people who ask my best."

2500|$|The police made a {{determined}} effort {{to hunt for}} the killer, now nicknamed [...] "Bible John", but although a number of suspects were questioned, no arrests were ever made, and no further victims {{have been attributed to}} him. The hunt for Bible John was Scotland's biggest manhunt. More than 100 detectives worked on the case and over 50,000 statements were taken in door-to-door enquiries. In order to track down the killer, fearing that he would strike again, a team of 16 detectives were instructed to mingle with dancers at the Barrowland and other ballrooms in the city. In particular they frequented the Barrowland on Thursday and Saturday nights for the over-25s nights, where each victim was said to have been charmed by the killer. Despite the huge manhunt, there were no further developments and the case went cold. Many felt that he had died, been jailed, was in a mental hospital or that the police <b>knew</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> was but could not prove anything, or that he was still at large killing. It was speculated that he moved away and was living in the south of England. It was known that serial killer Peter Tobin (see below) who lived in Glasgow in the late 1960s moved regularly between Scotland and the South of England, a crucial factor in allowing him to remain beyond the reaches of the police. He would then live in Brighton permanently for 20 years from the late 1960s.|$|E
