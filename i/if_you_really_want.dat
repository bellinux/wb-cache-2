They included a large {{cast of characters}} {{to ensure that the}} story was character-driven rather than story-driven. Co-president of Naughty Dog Evan Wells stated, [...] "I honestly think that the key element, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to boil it down, is characters. People will tell a story, but if it's not a character-driven plot then you are missing something." [...] Many of these characters were specifically designed to highlight different facets of Nathan Drake's personality.|$|E

Afterwards, go into an Apple store and just fool around, hang out in there. Afterwards, go to Starbucks and get a gift card. They have a book there on the history of Starbucks—buy this book and go home. If you do all these things you'll understand what Far Side Virtual is — because people kind of live in it already.|$|E
500|$|In December 1962, the Beatles {{concluded}} {{their fifth}} and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, {{they had agreed}} that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, {{in an effort to}} maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, [...] "Look, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to get in these bigger places, you're {{going to have to change}} – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ..." [...] Lennon said: [...] "We used to dress how we liked, on and off stage. He'd tell us that jeans were not particularly smart and could we possibly manage to wear proper trousers, but he didn't want us suddenly looking square. He'd let us have our own sense of individuality." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, Survival {{published}} the book There You Go! (Oren Ginzburg), which depicted a tribal society being harmed by development. In the book's foreword, Stephen Corry wrote: [...] "The 'development' of tribal peoples against their wishes – really to let others get {{their land and}} resources – is rooted in 19th century colonialism ('We know best') dressed up in 20th century 'political correct' euphemism. Tribal peoples are not backward: they are independent and vibrant societies which, {{like all of us}} always, are constantly adapting to a changing world. The main difference between tribal peoples and us is that we take their land and resources, and believe the dishonest, even racist, claim that it's for their own good. It's conquest, not development. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to understand what's going on, read this book." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "At (Cambridge) {{university}} I {{first became}} {{conscious of the}} creative role of politics in shaping human affairs, and I owe that mostly to my teachers Joan Robinson and Nicholas Kaldor. Joan Robinson was a brilliant teacher, but she also sought to awaken the inner conscience of her students {{in a manner that}} very few others were able to achieve. She questioned me a great deal and made me think the unthinkable. She propounded the left wing interpretation of Keynes, maintaining that the state has to play more of a role <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to combine development with social equity. Kaldor influenced me even more; I found him pragmatic, scintillating, stimulating. Joan Robinson was a great admirer {{of what was going on}} in China, but Kaldor used the Keynesian analysis to demonstrate that capitalism could be made to work." ...|$|E

Darkchild, who produced music from Jackson's tenth studio album Discipline (2008), co-produced the song with her. He reported to MTV {{that he had been}} working on new material with Jackson since her departure from Island Records in September 2008. Of the new material, he commented, [...] "It's about dancing... It's all about her. It's about , 'Listen, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> to get with me, you gotta make me feel a certain way'... We're going back to basics and fundamental sounds of Janet. We're trying to target her fans [...] the records that her fans will embrace."

5000|$|The trio knew {{director}} John Landis, {{who encouraged}} them to write a film based on their theatre sketches. They managed to put the film, called The Kentucky Fried Movie, in production in the late 1970s, and entered a movie set for the first time. David Zucker explains: [...] "It {{was the first time}} we had ever been on a movie set. We learned a lot. We learned that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> a movie to come out the way you wanted it to, you had to direct. So on the next movie, Airplane!, we insisted on directing." [...] Filming took 34 days, mostly during August 1979.
