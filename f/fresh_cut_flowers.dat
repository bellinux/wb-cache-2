The industry compliments {{the export of}} <b>fresh,</b> native <b>cut</b> <b>flowers.</b> Bleaching {{is an important step}} in the processing of plant material that is to be marketed, bleached or dyed. Profitability is dependant upon attainment of high white quality and on cost efficient utilisation of expensive bleaching chemicals. Sodium chlorite is an excellent bleaching agent because it is relatively selective for lignin. Hydrogen peroxide may be more practical for some plant materials because it is less expensive. Choice of an effective bleach activator, such as hypochlorous acid for chlorite bleach, is critical for cost efficient processing. Relative efficiency of different bleach regimes can be compared by assaying residual lignin using ultraviolet or fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Multistage bleaching, where peroxide is used first to remove about 50 % of lignin, followed by chlorite treatment, is likely to reduce processing costs...|$|R

5000|$|This {{research}} {{found that the}} best additive for flowers was the retailer-provided [...] "flower food" [...] that is usually given with a bouquet. Plants are known to thrive {{in an environment where}} there are few bacteria, plenty of food for energy, and water uptake is encouraged. Flower foods contain an acidifier that helps to adjust the water's pH. With a lower pH the water and food conducting system within the flower can work at maximum efficiency. The sugar in the food will be used by the plant as an energy source, which had been lost when the flower was cut away from its root. With these nutrients the plant will be able to fully develop. Finally, there are stem unpluggers that will make sure that the flower can easily take up water and nutrients that can later be used {{to take care of the}} needs of the rest of the plant.

Due {{to the nature of the}} holiday revolving around astronomical changes the date of the holiday can change from year to year but it will usually fall anywhere between March 19-22.

The Japanese would also take the time to renew their lives by cleaning their homes and making life changes such as starting or finishing school or a new hobby. Today Shunbun no Hi is a national holiday and the majority of Japanese will have the day off work to celebrate with their families. Many people will return to their homes they originally come from to spend the day with their families. The day is celebrated to bring in the spring season and to appreciate the nature blooming after a long winter. Some people will still visit their loved ones' grave sites, sweep the gravestone clear of debris, and often leave offerings of food or <b>fresh</b> <b>cut</b> <b>flowers.</b> The holiday is also special to farmers and agriculturalists as a day to pray for good luck and fortune for the crops they may grow in the upcoming season.|$|E

Although these items appear harmless, there could be hidden threats in that baggage and in those truckloads, trainloads, and containers of fresh and processed food items that could seriously threaten U. S. agriculture, its natural resources, and its economy (U. S. Customs and Border Protection 2007). Food imports {{play a major role}} in the success and competitiveness of various agribusiness firms in the United States. For example, food imports generate income, employment, output, and taxes and provide consumers with lower-priced products than those produced or purchased in the domestic markets. Food imports also provide consumers with a larger variety of products that normally would not be available to them, or that would be available in limited quantities and at higher than normal prices. Consequently, without food imports many U. S. food processing and manufacturing firms would be forced to reduce plant capacity, re-locate food processing and manufacturing facilities, or close plants altogether (Rosson 2000). Thus it is important that food imports that do not comply with U.
