We find that voters draw different inferences when they see reneging by different actors, and only Left governments are punished for breaking their promises.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of domestic institutional structures on international financial market sentiment during financial crises. It asks whether rationalist institutionalism is correct by suggesting that financial market participants make optimising rational choices about domestic institutions when assessing whether <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>commitments</b> by national policymakers are consistent with domestic policy constraints. To clarify the issue I have undertaken an empirical study of market sentiment from a procedural angle. I use focused structured comparison {{as a means of}} undertaking an investigation of the process of market decision-making during a single historical episode in which the credibility of currency commitments was at stake, the 1992 / 93 ERM crisis. This approach allowed for a rigorous detailed longitudinal reconstruction of how domestic institutional variables, which have been identified by rationalist institutionalism as critical for monetary policy outcomes (financial structure, wage bargaining structure, political structure), influenced market sentiment towards pound sterling, the French franc and the D-mark. I conclude that, firstly, market participants took account of domestic institutional structures in a broadly rational fashion. But given that, in the practice of financial market trading, information is incomplete and the cognitive capacities of market analysts are limited, market rationality is bounded and not optimising. Market participants "satisfice": they economise on their decision-making by stopping the process of assessment at a practically acceptable, rather than an optimal solution. This leads to inefficient market outcomes manifested in unstable expectations about institutions and lack of robustness in institutional analysis. Secondly, market sentiment is characterised by uncertainty about the structural underpinnings of political <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>commitments,</b> allowing considerable room for national policy-making autonomy through strategic interaction between national policymakers and international financial markets. Thirdly, the practical nature of decision-making by financial market participants has not been recognised by rationalist institutionalism, explaining its theoretical ambiguities regarding {{the influence of}} domestic institutions on market sentiment...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{adoption}} of a flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system in 1973, central banks of most industrialized countries have continued to intervene in foreign exchange markets.

40|$|The {{institutional}} structure of monetary policy has seen some profound changes in recent decades. Exchange rate systems have prospered and perished. Periods of high inflation {{have given way}} to the present - more tranquil - times. Several theoretical models have been proposed to capture the essence of these dynamics. Based on these models, policy- and institutional-changes have been implemented, sometimes very drastically and successfully. The design of the European Central Bank, for instance, seems to be based directly on the insights of the mainstream (game) -theoretical literature. Although the theoretical models in de area of monetary policy have reached great sophistication, some empirical issues have been somewhat neglected. The present study sheds some light on three - related - issues. First, the interaction between <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>commitments</b> and central bank independence. Both have been proposed as a means for efficient disinflation. However, a good evaluation requires a side-by-side comparison, as performed in this study. Secondly, the role of the exchange rate in the formation of inflationary expectations is highlighted. If the two aforementioned proposals work, the effectiveness of these policy-proposals might be increased if future effects are quickly incorporated in present actions through rapid adjustments of expectations. This claim is examined through survey evidence. Finally, the determinants of inflationary preferences, both on the individual and the aggregate level, are examined.

The hypothesis is tested on the Czech dataset because the Czech Republic is considered as the prototypical small open economy with inflation targeting.

We examine how the exchange rate affects the supply of short-term debt facing the government.

In a more conventional fixed peg, it can be optimal {{for the government to}} choose a level of the exchange rate that would be likely to result in partial or complete debt default. Depending on the exchange rate regime, multiple equilibria exist, in one of which the interest rate is high, the exchange rate is overvalued, output is low, and default is high.

40|$|Credibility of an {{exchange}} rate policy {{is one of the}} most important factors contributing to success or failure of any stabilization program. Authorities usually hope that the public will trust official <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>commitments</b> and take decisions regarding domestic currency holdings accordingly. However, as the experience of several countries analyzed in this study shows, this is not always the case. Economic agents behave in line with their own expectations which need not directly reflect central bank's commitments but are most often a combination of official policy and public's own notions regarding its actual future course. There are clear advantages of high credibility of {{exchange rate policy}} to the country's disinflation efforts. It can help bring inflation down quicker and reduce inevitable output losses. Naturally, this prompts the question of whether one can quantify credibility and find factors that are affecting it. Various studies found in the literature have attempted to find an answer to this problem. In line with these efforts, our paper tries to shed new light on the issue. It makes use of the new theoretical model specially designed to approximate credibility of exchange rate policy and provides its empirical application for a number of transition economies that have actively used exchange rate policy in their stabilization programs during the 1990 s. For each country we present the modelderived coefficient of credibility, draw conclusions from the model's predictions and confront it with the behavior of other macroeconomic indicators. The resulting analysis and discussion enable us to identify a set of possible "independent" factors explaining the developments of credibility. Our paper is composed as follows. Chapter 2 presents the theoretical model and its dynamics. Subsequent chapters are devoted to individual countries and contain empirical estimation of the model and the discussion of results.

It develops a Barro-Gordon type two-country model and compares noncooperative equilibria under different assumptions of monetary policy credibility and different exchange rate regimes. Using a two-stage game approach to the strategic choice of policy instruments, it identifies optimal (in a Pare to sense) and sustainable (self-enforcing) exchange rate regimes. The theoretical results indicate that the choice of such regimes depends fundamentally on the credibility of monetary policy commitments by the two countries’ authorities. The nature of shocks to the economies and the substitutability between goods produced in the two countries also play some role. International coordination on instrument choice is necessary to design optimal and sustainable exchange rate regimes.

Later, the capital liberalisation required for the progressive integration in the EU exposed the CEEC to speculative attacks and <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pressure and most of them weakened the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>commitment</b> or withdrew it at all. The Baltic States are the only ones still maintaining a strong exchange-rate commitment. The authors conjecture that this is due to the smaller size of these countries, which makes the interest rates of the domestic currency of little importance to the economy when compared to the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> Policy advice completes this report...|$|R
40|$|Beginning in 1985 Italy {{embarked}} on a path of progressive removal of its system of controls on portfolio investment, a process formally completed with the abolition of all remaining restrictions in 1990. In this paper we review this policy of capital liberalization and integrate the analysis with {{an examination of the}} process of stabilization of the lira <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> in the 1980 s.

40|$|Recent {{crisis and}} {{economic}} recession caused {{in many countries}} problems with drop in inflation and overall downturn in economic growth. The Central Banks found themselves in so called zero lower bound. This thesis describes the situation of deflation, zero lower bound and liquidity trap. These conditions called {{for the use of}} alternative monetary policy tools. The main goal of the thesis is to evaluate the use of foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> intervention as unconventional tool in a small open economy with inflation targeting regime represented by the Czech Republic in the analytic part. Thesis examines other non-standard instruments and provides reasons for the Czech National Bank decision. The analysis shows the complexity of the issue and provides the evidence that <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>commitment</b> was not displayed to the desired price level. The tool could lead to expected repercussion, but the effect is impacted by factors, which Central Bank cannot control. The effect of the CB way to fight the decreasing inflation will be better shown after the CB exit from the commitment...|$|R
40|$|In {{reaction}} on {{existence of}} economic cycles, {{the period of}} economic growth is changed with the economic recession, which can grow in the crisis eventually. In such a case, the task of economic policy is to direct {{the economy in the}} right direction, back to the boom. The thesis focuses on monetary policy and its ability to achieve this task. The aim of the thesis is to analyze the influence of foreign exchange interventions used in the period of 2013 - 2017 on the restoration of financial and (macro) economic stability of the Czech Republic. For this purpose, time series of indices describing the stability, the financial stress index and the economic stress index are constructed. A comparative analysis proves that the financial and (macro) economic situation in the Czech Republic has started to stabilize shortly before the unilateral <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>commitment</b> to the euro and the impact of foreign exchange interventions cannot be certainly confirmed...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} of currency convertibility {{in the process of}} economic transition in Eastern Europe and discusses alternative institutional options for achieving this difficult task. It shows that an early transition to convertibility is an indispensable requirement for the success of real sector reforms but that this is only sustainable if the existing flow and stock disequilibria are removed. The options of flexible rates and an East European Payments Union seem less demanding in terms of internal financial stringency, but the former would lead to a high degree of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> instability and the latter would only provide a very limited foreign impact on the domestic restructuring. The paper, therefore, focuses on fixed rate solutions (or adjustable pegs with a preannounced depreciation rate). It shows that the credibility of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>commitment</b> and the degree of internal financial stringency, which are both crucial for the sustainability of convertibility and for a non-inflationary monetary framework in Eastern Europe, can be considerably increased if all monetary policy competencies are transferred to a supranational institution which is designed according to the blueprint for a European System of Central Banks.

40|$|We assess {{monetary}} regime options for Latin American countries. The {{costs of a}} common currency are likely to outweigh its benefits, as those countries face diverse economic shocks, do not trade much with each other, and are affected by common international financial shocks only {{to the same extent}} as the average pair of emerging markets. Unilateral dollarization would be desirable only for those countries where there are strong links to the U. S. economy, the credibility of the monetary authorities is irreversibly lost, and there is keen demand for dollar-denominated financial assets. Finally, some countries in the region seem to be good candidates for meaningful and useful floating. <b>Exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes;Dollarization;exchange rate, inflation, monetary policy, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, terms of trade, foreign exchange, foreign currency, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation rate, currency areas, inflation targeting, intermediate <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> currency unions, real interest <b>rates,</b> floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements, real interest rate, terms of trade shocks, nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> monetary aggregate, price level, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policy, currency boards, low inflation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> fluctuations, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> rate of inflation, real variables, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> crisis, high inflation, effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation target, relative price, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pegs, relative prices, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, lower inflation, <b>exchange</b> arrangements, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> depreciations, real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation stabilization, <b>exchange</b> restrictions, monetary institutions, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system, foreign <b>exchange</b> reserves, increase in interest <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> passes, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> expectations, foreign <b>exchange</b> markets, intermediate <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> levels, <b>exchange</b> markets, foreign <b>exchange</b> market, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> peg, forward <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> aggregate demand, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> arrangements, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements, nominal interest <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policies, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> adjustments, macroeconomic stability, expectations of inflation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> appreciation, real <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> adjustment, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>commitment,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> crises, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> high interest <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> devaluations, money growth, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, money supply, forward <b>exchange,</b> nominal interest <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pass, inflation tax...|$|R
