The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially through the 1960s as all whale stocks had been depleted, and practically stopped in 1988 after the International Whaling Commission placed a moratorium which banned whaling for commercial use. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, gray whales may be as numerous as they were prior to whaling, making it the first marine mammal to {{be taken off the}} Endangered species list.

The Julianna company went bankrupt in 1888. The shareholders rescued the company and renamed it the Geyser Mining Company. Although Flower withdrew from the management, the Geyser Mining Company continued to be run by some of Flower's cronies, so it should not be a surprise that the mine never made a profit.

40|$|The {{recovery}} of fish stocks is in principle an investment decision weighing up short term losses against future gains. In the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) of the EU long term management or recovery plans are a main instrument. One {{of the basic}} aims is to move from a short term to a longer term perspective in the management process by having automatic rules about how to set quotas in the following years. This gives fishermen more security on catch possibilities in the future. However, {{it is not clear}} whether measures in recovery plans are economically feasible or not. Fishermen may lose more than they gain from such a recovery plan. In the first part of the paper we describe the economics behind long term management plans and the rationale of such plans from an economic viewpoint. Secondly, we use the Baltic cod fishery as an example to compare the present value of recovery scenarios and a status quo scenario. As a simplification only one cod stock is assumed in that calculation (in the Baltic Sea a western and <b>eastern</b> <b>stock</b> are distinguished). In the meantime a long term management plan for Baltic cod is in place since 2008.

40|$|About 1500 ovaries of Baltic cod were {{prepared}} for estimating the potential absolute and relative individual fecundity. The female cod were sampled in the Belt Sea, ICES Subdivision (SD) 22, in the Arkona Sea, SD 24, and in the Bornholm Sea, SD 25. The investigations started in 1992 and until 1999 cruises were carried out to catch female cod in the different sub-divisions every year. The results shows that the potential fecundity is not a stable biological parameter, and that significant changes are possible within a relative short period. It was demonstrated that the developments of the potential individual fecundity of the western (Gadus morhua morhua) and <b>eastern</b> Baltic cod <b>stocks</b> (Gadus morhua callarias) were different. In contrast to the stable individual fecundity of the western cod the absolute and relative fecundity of the eastern repeat spawners increased from 1993 to 1999, significantly.

Haplotype diversity (H = 0. 9164 ? 0. 0035) was high and nucleotide diversity (? = 0. 00967 ? 0. 00586) was moderate. No evidence was observed for significant genetic bottleneck effects. Rookeries were grouped into regions and stocks to examine structure at different spatial scales. F- and ?-statistics were computed for all pairwise comparisons of rookeries, regions and stocks. Significant (P< 0. 05) divergence of <b>eastern</b> <b>stock</b> (southeastern Alaska to California) animals from western stock animals was supported in analyses at all spatial scales. Likewise, rookeries and regions from Asia {{were found to be}} significantly different from all other western stock rookeries. This was most clearly demonstrated using ?-statistics at the regional level. The Commander Islands clearly associate with Alaskan western stock rookeries, not with the Asian rookeries. Within each of the three stocks there is significant isolation by distance among rookeries. This relationship does not hold for inter-stock comparisons indicating that there are important barriers to gene flow among stocks. Mitochondrial DNA analysis supports the recognition of three stocks for appropriate conservation of the species. The currently recognized <b>eastern</b> <b>stock</b> is unaffected, but the western stock is now partitioned west of the Commander Islands yielding a western stock which ranges from Prince William Sound west to the Commander Islands, and an Asian stock including rookeries from the Kamchatka Peninsula, Kuril Islands, and Sea of Okhtosk...|$|E
