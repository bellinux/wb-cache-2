Two fuels, diesel oil and dimethyl ether (DME), were studiedin {{order to achieve}} HCCI-like combustion. Limited size reactionmechanisms were constructed and used in the modeling. The <b>dieseloil</b> surrogate mechanism consisting of a mixture of n-heptane andtoluene includes 70 species participating in 305 reactions, whereasthe mechanism for DME consists of 43 species participating in 211 reactions. The combustion development has been simulated in aFPE prototype geometry. It is illustrated that by varying the directinjection timings, a comparably efficient, low-emission operationhas been achieved for both fuels. Specific difficulties when usingslowly vaporizing diesel oil and rapidly vaporizing DME are outlined...|$|E
