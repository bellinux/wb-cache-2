5|$|Although it has {{not been}} shown {{experimentally}} if the spores can survive the passage through an animal's digestive tract, the regular presence of Cyathus on cow or horse manure strongly suggest that this is true. Alternatively, the <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> casing of peridioles ejected from splash cups may simply disintegrate over time, eventually releasing the spores within.|$|E
5|$|When laying eggs, females grow {{a special}} type of bone between the <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> bone and the marrow of their limbs. This {{medullary}} bone, which {{is rich in}} calcium, is used to make eggshells. A discovery of features in a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton provided evidence of medullary bone in extinct dinosaurs and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen. Further research has found medullary bone in the carnosaur Allosaurus and the ornithopod Tenontosaurus. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to Tenontosaurus {{very early in the}} evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Insects have {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} exoskeletons, the <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> covering made mostly of chitin. The {{segments of the}} body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or tagmata: a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head supports a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and, if present, one to three simple eyes (or ocelli) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has six segmented legs—one pair each for the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax—and, none, two or four wings. The abdomen consists of eleven segments, though in a few species of insects, these segments may be fused together or reduced in size. The abdomen also contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive internal structures. Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur, especially wings, legs, antenna and mouthparts.|$|E

50|$|At {{the start}} of the 2014 US season, LFL {{unveiled}} new helmets by Bauer, designed with a <b>harder</b> <b>outer</b> shell and more padding than the CCM helmets used the past 4 years. They are still equipped with the concussion meters. Chinstraps, while still by Russell, are thicker and have more padding.|$|R
25|$|As with {{everything}} to do with sprung floors, a combination of types is often used. A core of softer durometer may have a <b>harder</b> <b>outer</b> layer shaped so that heavy falls encounter more resistance instead of 'bottoming out' to a concrete subfloor. This also protects against deformation by heavy weights like pianos.|$|R
5|$|In nature, Suillus spraguei forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with five-needled pine species. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around {{the roots of}} the trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. S.spraguei produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and rhizomorphs that are tubular fungal cords with a <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> sheath. The fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate with white pine, a grouping of trees classified in subgenus Strobus of the genus Pinus. However, under controlled pure culture conditions in the laboratory, S.spraguei has also been shown to form associations with Red Pine, Pitch Pine, and Loblolly Pine. Asian populations have been associated with Korean Pine, Chinese White Pine, Siberian Dwarf Pine and Japanese White Pine. In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other boletes, as early as June (bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in July–September), although they may be found as late as October. Mushrooms can be parasitized by the fungus Hypomyces completus. In the asexual stage of H.completus, it appears initially as patches of whitish mold {{on the surface of the}} cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce conidia (asexual spores). In the sexual stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black as it makes perithecia, asci-containing sexual structures that produce ascospores. The perithecia are pimply and give the surface a roughened texture.|$|E
25|$|When laying eggs, female birds grow {{a special}} type of bone in their limbs between the <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> bone and the marrow. This {{medullary}} bone, which {{is rich in}} calcium, is used to make eggshells, and the birds that produced it absorb it when they have finished laying eggs. Medullary bone {{has been found in}} fossils of the theropods Tyrannosaurus and Allosaurus and of the ornithopod Tenontosaurus.|$|E
25|$|The {{fruit is}} an achene, similar to {{sunflower}} seed, {{with a single}} seed inside a <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> hull. The starchy endosperm is white and makes up {{most or all of}} buckwheat flour. The seed coat is green or tan, which darkens buckwheat flour. The hull is dark brown or black, and some may be included in buckwheat flour as dark specks. The dark flour is known as blé noir (black wheat) in French, along with the name sarrasin (saracen).|$|E

50|$|The basic {{anatomy of}} the N. tomentosus is broken up into three {{separate}} functional body regions: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. The entire body wall of N. tomentosus is called the exoskeleton. This tough outer layer provides strong protection and different areas where muscles can attach and provide movement. Their <b>harder</b> <b>outer</b> layer is made of cuticle yet the skin is broken up into many different hardened plates that are separated by sutures. This allows flexible movement and doesn’t cause it to move rigidly.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{decrease}} {{of the mechanical}} properties – hardness and reduced elastic modulus after corrosion in white wine was measured. Under static corrosion conditions no significant decrease was observed up to 8 hours of corrosion. Dynamic corrosion conditions cause detrimental {{decrease of}} properties (one order of magnitude) compare {{to the results of}} static corrosion test. This is due to the removal of the <b>harder</b> <b>outer</b> layer of the enamel during polishing. To obtain a relevant data concerning corrosion test, natural surface of a tooth should be investigated and tested...|$|R
25|$|Although beaks vary {{significantly}} {{in size and}} shape from species to species, their underlying structures have a similar pattern. All beaks are composed of two jaws, generally known as the upper mandible (or maxilla) and lower mandible (or mandible). The upper, {{and in some cases}} the lower, mandibles are strengthened internally by a complex three-dimensional network of bony spicules (or trabeculae) seated in soft connective tissue and surrounded by the <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> layers of the beak. The avian jaw apparatus is made up of two units: one four-bar linkage mechanism and one five-bar linkage mechanism.|$|E
25|$|In the puffballs, {{which include}} the genera Lycoperdon, Bovista, and Calvatia, spores are formed within spherical to pestle-shaped fruit bodies and are {{released}} either by wind (as the fruit body wears away, exposing the spore mass inside) or by raindrops. In the latter case, the fruit bodies develop an ostiole (apical hole) through which spores are puffed out by the pressure of raindrops falling on the fruit body surface. The same ingenious mechanism has evolved separately in the earthstars (Geastrum species), which have a <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> layer to the fruitbody that splits open in a star-like manner to reveal the puffball-like spore sack.|$|E
25|$|Tsetse have {{an unusual}} {{lifecycle}} {{which may be}} due to the richness of their food source. A female fertilizes only one egg at a time and retains each egg within her uterus to have the offspring develop internally during the first three larval stages, a method called adenotrophic viviparity. During this time, the female feeds the developing offspring with a milky substance secreted by a modified gland in the uterus. In the third larval stage, the tsetse larva leaves the uterus and begins its independent life. The newly independent tsetse larva crawls into the ground, and develops a <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> shell called the puparial case, in which it completes its morphological transformation into an adult fly.|$|E

50|$|A concordant, longitudinal, or Pacific type {{coastline}} occurs where beds, or layers, {{of differing}} rock types are folded into ridges that run {{parallel to the}} coast. The <b>outer</b> <b>hard</b> rock (for example, granite) provides a protective barrier to erosion of the softer rocks (for example, clays) further inland. Sometimes the <b>outer</b> <b>hard</b> rock is punctured, allowing the sea to erode the softer rocks behind. This creates a cove, a circular area of water with a relatively narrow entrance from the sea.|$|R
5|$|The Scottish Terrier {{typically}} has a <b>hard,</b> wiry <b>outer</b> {{coat with}} a soft, dense undercoat. The coat should be trimmed and blended into the furnishings {{to give a}} distinct Scottish Terrier outline. The longer coat on the beard, legs and lower body may be slightly softer than the body coat but should not be or appear fluffy.|$|R
25|$|Insects, {{like all}} arthropods, have no {{interior}} skeleton; instead, {{they have an}} exoskeleton, a <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> layer made mostly of chitin which protects and supports the body. The insect body {{is divided into three}} parts: the head, thorax, and abdomen. The head is specialized for sensory input and food intake; the thorax, which is the anchor point for the legs and wings (if present), is specialized for locomotion; and the abdomen for digestion, respiration, excretion, and reproduction. Although the general function of the three body regions is the same across all insect species, there are major differences in basic structure, with wings, legs, antennae, and mouthparts being highly variable from group to group.|$|E
25|$|When laying eggs, female birds grow {{a special}} type of bone in their limbs. This {{medullary}} bone forms as a calcium-rich layer inside the <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> bone, {{and is used}} as a calcium source to make eggshells. The presence of endosteally derived bone tissues lining the interior marrow cavities of portions of a Tyrannosaurus rex specimen's hind limb suggested that T. rex used similar reproductive strategies, and revealed that the specimen is female. Further research has found medullary bone in the theropod Allosaurus and ornithopod Tenontosaurus. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to Tenontosaurus very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that dinosaurs in general produced medullary tissue.|$|E
25|$|Trabecular bone (or cancellous bone) is the sponge-like bone in {{the ends}} of long bones and vertebrae. Cortical bone is the <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> shell of bones and the middle of long bones. Because osteoblasts and osteoclasts inhabit the surface of bones, trabecular bone is more active and is more subject to bone {{turnover}} and remodeling. Not only is bone density decreased, but the microarchitecture of bone is also disrupted. The weaker spicules of trabecular bone break ("microcracks"), and are replaced by weaker bone. Common osteoporotic fracture sites, the wrist, the hip and the spine, have a relatively high trabecular bone to cortical bone ratio. These areas rely on the trabecular bone for strength, so the intense remodeling causes these areas to degenerate most when the remodeling is imbalanced. Around the ages of 30–35, cancellous or trabecular bone loss begins. Women may lose as much as 50%, while men lose about 30%.|$|E
25|$|The lens is a {{transparent}} convex or 'lens' shaped {{body with a}} <b>harder</b> <b>outer</b> layer and a softer inner layer. It focuses {{the light on the}} retina. The shape of the lens can be altered by ciliary muscles which are directly attached to lens capsule by means of the zonular fibres. In addition to these muscles, some birds also have a second set, Crampton’s muscles, that can change the shape of the cornea, thus giving birds a greater range of accommodation than is possible for mammals. This accommodation can be rapid in some diving water birds such as in the mergansers. The iris is a coloured muscularly operated diaphragm in front of the lens which controls the amount of light entering the eye. At the centre of the iris is the pupil, the variable circular area through which the light passes into the eye.|$|R
50|$|Depending {{upon how}} form-fitting the boot is, {{to allow a}} rider to easily get the boot on or off, the shaft may be {{designed}} to open lengthwise. If so, Velcro or other hook-and-loop fasteners are typically used on the inner sides of the opening to allow the rider to close the boot over the foot, ankle and leg. This allows for some flexibility for the rider to control the boot's tightness. Some manufacturers also include an internal quick-lacing system between a soft inner leg and the <b>harder</b> <b>outer</b> shell of the boot shaft to further ensure a tight, but comfortable fit. The heel of a racing boot is typically very low: not more than 1/2-inch (13 mm), and sole of the heel and foot is typically rather smooth. A curved plastic or composite plate may be included to cover the shin of the boot to protect the rider's shin.|$|R
50|$|Gloeocapsa magma {{has gained}} notoriety in the Southeastern United States, but, {{it is also}} {{spreading}} throughout the Midwest. This particular type of cyanobacteria is responsible for creating black stains and streaks on roofs. The bacteria accumulate over time as it feeds on moisture and calcium carbonate. This accumulation begins to show the black stains as the cyanobacteria develop their dark and <b>hard</b> UV-protective <b>outer</b> coating.|$|R
25|$|As the ovules {{develop into}} seeds, the ovary begins to ripen and the ovary wall, the pericarp, may become fleshy (as in berries or drupes), or form a <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> {{covering}} (as in nuts). In some multiseeded fruits, {{the extent to}} which the flesh develops is proportional to the number of fertilized ovules. The pericarp is often differentiated into two or three distinct layers called the exocarp (outer layer, also called epicarp), mesocarp (middle layer), and endocarp (inner layer). In some fruits, especially simple fruits derived from an inferior ovary, other parts of the flower (such as the floral tube, including the petals, sepals, and stamens), fuse with the ovary and ripen with it. In other cases, the sepals, petals and/or stamens and style of the flower fall off. When such other floral parts are a significant part of the fruit, it is called an accessory fruit. Since other parts of the flower may contribute to the structure of the fruit, it is important to study flower structure to understand how a particular fruit forms.|$|E
500|$|The spores remain dormant {{inside the}} {{sporocarp}} through unfavorable conditions, but when conditions are suitable and wet, the sporocarp will germinate. [...] It splits into halves, allowing the tissue coiled inside to become hydrated. [...] As this internal tissue swells with water, it pushes the {{halves of the}} <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> covering apart, and emerges as a long gelatinous worm-like sorophore. [...] The sorophore is a sorus-bearing structure unique to the Marsileaceae; it may extend to more than ten times {{the length of the}} sporocarp inside which it was coiled. [...] This extension carries the numerous spore-producing sori attached along each side of the sorophore out into the water.|$|E
500|$|Alligator gar have gills, {{but unlike}} {{other species of}} fish, with few exceptions, {{they also have a}} highly vascularized swim bladder lung that {{supplements}} gill respiration. The bladder not only provides buoyancy but also enables them to breathe in air which is why they are able to inhabit bodies of water in which most other fishes would die of suffocation. [...] The swim bladder is connected to their foregut by a small pneumatic duct which allows them to breathe or gulp air when they break the surface, an action that is seen quite frequently on lakes in the southern United States during the hot summer months. [...] The scales of alligator gar are not like the scales of other fishes which have flexible elasmoid scales; their bodies are protected by inflexible and articulated ganoid scales that are diamond-shaped, often with serrated edges, and composed of a tough inner layer of bone and <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> layer of ganoin which is essentially homologous to tooth enamel, making them nearly impenetrable.|$|E

40|$|A low {{background}} double-wall piston-cylinder-type {{pressure cell}} is {{developed at the}} Paul Scherrer Institute. The cell is made from BERLYCO- 25 (beryllium copper) and MP 35 N nonmagnetic alloys with the design and dimensions which are specifically adapted to muon-spin rotation/relaxation (muSR) measurements. The mechanical design and performance of the pressure cell are evaluated using finite-element analysis (FEA). By including the measured stress-strain characteristics of the material into the finite-element model, the cell dimensions are optimized with the aim to reach the highest possible pressure while maintaining the sample space large (6 mm in diameter and 12 mm high). The presented unconventional design of the double-wall piston-cylinder pressure cell with a <b>harder</b> <b>outer</b> MP 35 N sleeve and asofter inner CuBe cylinder enables pressures of up to 2. 6 GPa to be reached at ambient temperatures, corresponding to 2. 2 GPa at low temperatures without any irreversible damage to the pressure cell.

2500|$|The <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> {{layer of}} bones is {{composed}} of cortical bone also called compact bone. Cortical referring to the outer (cortex) layer. The <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> layer gives bone its smooth, white, and solid appearance, and accounts for 80% of the total bone mass of an adult human skeleton. Cortical bone consists of multiple microscopic columns, each called an osteon. Each column is multiple layers of osteoblasts and osteocytes around a central canal called the haversian canal. Volkmann's canals at right angles connect the osteons together. The columns are metabolically active, and as bone is reabsorbed and created the nature and location of the cells within the osteon will change. Cortical bone is covered by a periosteum on its outer surface, and an endosteum on its inner surface. The endosteum is {{the boundary between the}} cortical bone and the cancellous bone.|$|E
2500|$|... "True berries", or [...] "baccae", {{may also}} be {{required}} to have a thin outer skin, not self-supporting when removed from the berry. This distinguishes, for example, a Vaccinium or Solanum berry from an Adansonia (baobab) amphisarca, which has a dry, more rigid and self-supporting skin. The fruit of citrus, such as the orange, kumquat and lemon, is a berry with a thick rind and a very juicy interior divided into segments by septae, that is given the special name [...] "hesperidium". A specialized term, pepo, is also used for fruits of the gourd family Cucurbitaceae, which are modified to have a <b>hard</b> <b>outer</b> rind, but are not internally divided by septae.

40|$|The volume {{fraction}} {{of material that}} remained elastic as yielding developed in cast-to-shape tensile specimens of binary alloys with Al contents between 0. 47 and 11. 6 mass% was calculated using the Kocks-Mecking method of analysis. In the most dilute alloys the elastic fraction decreased rapidly to zero at a well-defined stress, suggesting that yielding was uniform across the specimen, whereas in the concentrated ones it decreased gradually {{over a wide range}} of stresses, suggesting that yielding developed first in the softer core of the casting while the <b>harder</b> <b>outer</b> layer, or skin, remained elastic. Comparison with specimens of the concentrated alloys which had a surface layer removed showed that the strain hardening behavior of the core resembled that of full specimens of the most dilute alloy. The maximum amount of elastic material in comparison with the most dilute alloy was used to define the area fraction covered by the skin, for each alloy. The skin covered between ∼ 10 % and ∼ 30 % of the cross section, the greater values for the concentrated alloys. The skin imposed an elastic constraint that delayed the development of full plasticity at the core...|$|R
