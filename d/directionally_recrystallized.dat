40|$|The {{transverse}} and longitudinal {{tensile properties}} of the oxide dispersion strengthened nickel-base alloys were determined at 760 C. The alloys with small amounts of gamma prime have strength levels suitable for turbine vane applications, while other highly alloyed, gamma prime strengthened superalloys have strengths typical of turbine blade materials. These alloys were produced by mechanical alloying and extrusion and the turbine blade alloys were also <b>directionally</b> <b>recrystallized.</b> Resultant grain aspect ratios varied from 1 : 1 to over 20 : 1. Longitudinal tensile strengths ranged from 285 to 1175 MPa, while longitudinal elongations were in excess of 4 percent for all alloys. Transverse tensile strengths were comparable to longitudinal strengths, but transverse ductility levels were generally less than 2 percent elongation. Tensile and yield strengths increased with increasing strain rate over the range 0. 001 to 0. 05 per second. Ductility in both orientations was not strain rate sensitive but {{could be related to}} grain size and grain aspect ratio...|$|E
40|$|The {{intent of}} this program {{is to develop a}} basic {{understanding}} of cyclic creep-fatigue deformation mechanisms and damage accumulation, a capability for reliable life prediction, and the ability to model the constitutive behavior of anisotropic single crystal (SC) and <b>directionally</b> solidified or <b>recrystallized</b> (DSR) comprise the program, and the work breakdown for each option reflects a distinct concern for two classes of anisotropic materials, SC and DSR materials, at temperatures encountered in the primary gas path (airfoil temperatures), and at temperatures typical of the blade root attachment and shank area. Work directed toward the higher temperature area of concern in the primary gas path includes effects of coatings on the behavior and properties of the materials of interest. The blade root attachment work areas will address the effects of stress concentrations associated with attachment features...|$|R
