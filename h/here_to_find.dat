After questioning residents Farber (Bob Balaban), Bell (Mary Beth Hurt), Dury (Jeffrey Wright), and five nameless smokers, Brown discovers the author, Vick Ran (M.

Vick meeting Story eliminates his fear and sharpens his inner voice, but he learns he will be assassinated because of the controversial nature of his ideas.|$|E
25|$|On {{the planet}} Telos, an archeological {{expedition}} uncovers a hidden entrance in a mountain. The TARDIS lands nearby, and the expedition {{is joined by}} the Doctor, Jamie and Victoria. Parry, the expedition's leader, explains that they are <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{the remains of the}} Cybermen, who apparently died out five centuries before. The expedition is funded by Kaftan, who is accompanied by her manservant Toberman and her colleague Klieg. One of the men is electrocuted opening the doors, but the group manages to enter the chamber. They find a control panel and a large, sealed hatch. Parry and Klieg try to open it as Toberman leaves.|$|E

2500|$|The {{algorithm}} finds a maximal set of vertex disjoint augmenting {{paths of}} length [...] (Maximal means {{that no more}} such paths can be added. This is different from finding {{the maximum number of}} such paths, which would be harder to do. Fortunately, it is sufficient <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a maximal set of paths.) This set may be computed by depth first search (DFS) from [...] to the free vertices in , using the breadth first layering to guide the search: the DFS is only allowed to follow edges that lead to an unused vertex in the previous layer, and paths in the DFS tree must alternate between matched and unmatched edges. Once an augmenting path is found that involves one of the vertices in , the DFS is continued from the next starting vertex. Any vertex encountered during the DFS can immediately be marked as used, since if there is no path from it to [...] at the current point in the DFS, then that vertex can't be used to reach [...] at any other point in the DFS. This ensures [...] running time for the DFS. It is also possible to work in the other direction, from free vertices in [...] to those in , which is the variant used in the pseudocode.|$|E
