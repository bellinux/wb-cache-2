5000|$|Asteroid <b>hyalosis</b> is a {{degenerative}} {{condition of}} the eye involving small white opacities in the vitreous humor. It is known to occur in humans, dogs, cats and chinchillas. [...] Clinically, these opacities are quite refractile, giving the appearance of stars (or asteroids) shining in the night sky—except that ocular asteroids are often quite mobile. Ocular asteroids must be distinguished from the more common typical vitreous floaters, which are usually fibrillar or cellular condensates. The cause of asteroid <b>hyalosis</b> is unknown, {{but it has been}} associated with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and, in certain animals, tumors of the ciliary body. [...] In dogs, asteroid <b>hyalosis</b> is considered to be an age related change. [...] The asteroid bodies are made up of hydroxylapatite, which in turn consists of calcium and phosphates or phospholipids. [...] While asteroid <b>hyalosis</b> does not usually severely affect vision, the floating opacities can be quite annoying, and may interfere significantly with visualization and testing of the retina. [...] While treatment of asteroid <b>hyalosis</b> is usually unnecessary, vitrectomy may occasionally be indicated, for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.|$|E

40|$|A {{patient with}} {{retinitis}} pigmentosa showed visual disturbances following successful cataract surgery. He had a dense asteroid <b>hyalosis</b> {{in the eye}} before cataract surgery. After the surgery he noticed that his vision became worse. The visual disturbance was explained as being caused by the progression of retinal degeneration. Although the electroretinogram was non-recordable, the degeneration of macular area appeared relatively small. We considered that dense asteroid <b>hyalosis</b> was responsible for his visual disturbances, and pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was performed to remove the asteroid <b>hyalosis.</b> After the PPV, rapid improvement of his visual acuity was observed. Cataract surgery may affect the status of asteroid <b>hyalosis</b> and cause rapid visual loss. PPV should be considered for retinitis pigmentosa patients with dense asteroid <b>hyalosis,</b> especially when a large decrease in visual acuity is noted shortly after cataract surgery...|$|E
40|$|Two {{asymptomatic}} {{elderly women}} who underwent cataract extraction 7 {{or more years}} previously and with intraocular lens placement presented with a linear bead-like white multinodular mass in the inferior angle simulating iris metastasis versus large inflammatory precipitates. There was no iris infiltration. In the first case, the posterior lens capsule was intact {{and there was no}} evidence of gelatinous vitreous in the anterior chamber, whereas in the second case, the capsule was open and there was gelatinous vitreous prolapse. In both cases, there was asteroid <b>hyalosis</b> in the vitreous. Both patients were diagnosed with prolapsed vitreous asteroid <b>hyalosis</b> into the anterior chamber and managed with observation. Vitreous asteroid <b>hyalosis</b> can prolapse into the anterior chamber of pseudophakic elderly patients with or without capsular opening and can simulate an intraocular tumor...|$|E

30|$|Ocular B-mode {{ultrasonography}} (US) is {{an important}} adjuvant for the clinical assessment {{of a variety of}} ocular diseases. When ophthalmoscopy is not possible, mainly due to opacification of the transparent media (e.g., mature cataract or vitreous haemorrhage), US can guide the ophthalmologist in diagnosing disease and choosing treatment. The superficial location and cystic structure of the eye make US ideal for imaging of the eye. Moreover, dynamic study helps distinguish between various conditions that would otherwise be difficult to differentiate in some clinical setting, such as vitreous, retinal, and choroidal detachment. US is also good technique for detecting other pathologic conditions such as lens dislocation, vitreous haemorrhage, asteroid <b>hyalosis,</b> optic disc drusen, and tumors (e.g., choroidal melanoma, metastases, hemangioma). An understanding of the basic anatomy of the eye, the US technique, and common entities that affect the ocular globe will allow radiologists to offer this valuable imaging modality to patients and referring clinicians. This article focuses on the US anatomy and pathologic conditions that affect the posterior ocular segment.|$|E
40|$|Asteroid Hyalosis(AH) is {{a common}} {{clinical}} disease, which has been considered a benign disorder as it rarely impairs visual acuity. It was often discovered when the patient was treated for other eye diseases. The mechanism was unclear. Its characteristic B-ultrasound property makes the B-ultrasound a very helpful diagnostic technique. In {{the case of the}} patients with other fundus diseases associated with AH, optical coherence tomography(OCT) and fluorescein angiography(FA) may be used to reduce the interference from asteroid bodies, therefore improve the fundus visibility. Recent studies have shown that AH can incorporate with many other eye diseases. For example, in patients with cataracts, asteroid <b>hyalosis</b> can cause surface calcification of silicone plate intraocular lenses, which in most cases may lead to the need for explantation of the calcified intraocular lenses. The efficacy of pars plana vitrectomy(PPV), the removal of some, or all, of the eye's vitreous humor for AH remains controversial. In this paper, we provide a review of the recent literature on AH disease: the etiology, diagnosis and treatment. We hope to thus improve the awareness and outcomes of AH disease...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Understand the behavior, {{functional}} repercussion {{and relationship}} with epidemiological factors of asteroid <b>hyalosis</b> (AH) and retrospective observational case series. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients diagnosed with AH (24 women and 34 men) were studied. All patients were {{submitted to a}} thorough ophthalmological examination. RESULTS: We observed a statistical association between the presence of AH and male sex (p= 0, 042). An increase in prevalence of this pathology was observed with increasing age. We determined an odds ration of 5, 24 of a patient over 50 years old having AH, when compared to patients bellow this threshold. Eighty-six percent of patients had unilateral vitreous deposits. We measured a lower IOP in the affected eye, with the difference being in average 2, 68 ± 1, 45 mmHg (p= 0, 037). We observed no statistical association between AH and age related macular degeneration, diabetes or glaucoma. Five eyes were submitted to facoemulsification combined with pars plana vitrectomy with an average gain of 7 lines (Snellen) in visual acuity (p= 0, 03). CONCLUSION: In our sample a clear association between AH, ageing and male sex was observed. The majority of patients had unilateral vitreous deposits. Vitrectomy in association with facoemulsification is a safe and effective intervention in this group of patients...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{ascertain}} whether posterior hyaloid face (PHF) status (attached vs detached) affects {{the risk of}} intraoperative retinal breaks and number of operations in patients undergoing vitrectomy for floaters. Methods: Consecutive, comparative single-surgeon case series. All patients undergoing vitrectomy for visually disabling floaters between July 2003 and June 2016 were included in this study. Data were collected prospectively into a vitreoretinal database and reviewed retrospectively {{for the purpose of}} the study. The following data were collected on each patient: age in years, sex, axial length (mm), presence of myopia, pre- and postoperative visual acuity in logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution. The status of the PHF was ascertained using preoperative clinical and OCT assessment that was confirmed intraoperatively. [AQ 1] The presence or absence of a retinal break was considered the primary outcome measure. Significant visual loss (reduction in 2 log units visual acuity), number of operations, and time from surgery to discharge were considered the secondary outcomes. Sequential multiple logistic and Cox regression analyses were conducted. Results: Data were collected from 97 patients (55 males and 42 females). Indications for surgery were Fuchs heterochromic cyclitis (9 patients), asteroid <b>hyalosis</b> (12 patients), and vitreous syneresis (76 patients). Twenty-one patients were pseudophakic on presentation, while 76 underwent combined phacovitrectomy. Vitreous status was significantly associated with retinal breaks (P ¼. 010). Controlling for other parameters, the odds of a retinal break in patients with PHF attached were about 5. 5 times those in patients with PHF detached (95...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Asteroid <b>Hyalosis</b> (AH) is {{the name}} given to the {{condition}} in which calcium soaps gets deposited on vitreous fibrils in eyes. It gives a beautiful shiny star-like appearance in the black vitreous on ocular ultrasound (B Scan). Its asymptomatic nature, unilateral occurrence and unexplained association with diabetes, are points to ponder. Our previous prospective double blind study was continue further to understand the utility of AH as a harbinger of diabetes in otherwise unsuspected individuals. Material and Methods: In the study period from 2011 to 2013; 400 non diabetic patients and 200 known diabetic patients, between 40 - 55 years of age were assessed by B mode ultrasonography {{for the presence of}} AH. Results: The overall incidence of AH in our study was 12. 75 % in non-diabetic population and 59. 5 % in diabetic population. We found that the ultrasound demonstration of AH is 88. 51 % sensitive and 40. 81 % specific to identify presence of diabetes and it has a positive predictive value of 69. 31 % and a negative predictive value of 70. 17 %. Conclusion: Individuals with diagnosed diabetes have high incidence of AH. Occurrence of AH is more common in individuals who are prone to develop diabetes. So ocular ultrasound {{should be included in the}} routine annual health screening programs. Multicentric studies to evaluate the cause&# 150;effect relationship are warranted before this dictum becomes a universal doctrine. [Cukurova Med J 2014; 39 (2. 000) : 323 - 328...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the safety and efficacy of asteroid <b>hyalosis</b> (AH) removal by means of anterior vitrectomy through posterior capsulorhexis during phacoemulsification. Patients and methods The study was conducted on 16 eyes of 16 cataractous patients associated with AH. Phacoemulsification was performed, followed by removal of the AH through posterior capsulorhexis by means of anterior vitrectomy and before intraocular lens implantation. Patients were examined at 1 day, 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Data were analyzed using paired t-tests to compare the preoperative and postoperative uncorrected visual acuity and corrected visual acuity. The basic postoperative parameters at each follow-up visit were assessment of uncorrected visual acuity and corrected visual acuity and slit-lamp examination to evaluate the corneal condition and to detect any postoperative inflammation. The disappearance of AH was confirmed clinically using slit-lamp examination. Results All patients in this study showed a statistically significant improvement in postoperative visual acuity (P= 0. 001) at the last follow-up visit. One patient who had diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy showed deteriorated visual acuity at the last postoperative visit (P= 0. 2). Two patients had suboptimal best-corrected visual acuity after 6 months due to the presence of cellophane maculopathy detected clinically and using ocular coherence tomography (OCT) examination (P= 0. 01). Conclusion Removal of AH by means of anterior vitrectomy during phacoemulsification through a posterior capsulorhexis is safe and effective and enables the surgeon to treat undiagnosed missed retinal lesions that were not obvious preoperatively...|$|E
40|$|Diseases of the {{posterior}} segment, including those affecting the vitreous, retina, choroid, and optic disc, {{are common in}} small animals. These diseases may be of congenital, traumatic, inflammatory, degenerative, and neoplastic origin. Diseases of the vitreous affect both cats and dogs, but are more frequent in dogs. Vitreal conditions include persistence of the primary hyaloid vasculature (persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous [PHPV]), vitreal syneresis (liquefaction of the vitreous), asteroid <b>hyalosis</b> (presence of numerous white spherical opacities suspended in the vitreous), vitreal hemorrhage, and vitreal herniation through the pupil. Presentation of vitreous in the pupil and anterior chamber is usually associated with lens displacement and lensectomy, and cataract removal with rupture of {{the posterior}} lens capsule and anterior vitreous membrane. Neoplasms, pigment, parasites, foreign bodies, and cysts also affect the vitreous. For these vitreal diseases, surgery may be indicated for diagnosis, or treatment of the vitreal pupillary herniation into the anterior chamber. The removal of diseased vitreous and traction bands in the repair of retinal detachments will be presented in the section on retinal surgeries. Congenital and degenerative retinopathies are among the more frequently diagnosed clinical disorders in dogs, {{and the majority of}} these retinopathies appear inherited. Inflammations of the retina and choroid in dogs are frequent, and often associated with systemic infections. In cats, congenital and degenerative retinopathies are less frequent, but inflammations of the ocular fundus and hypertensive retinopathies are common. Surgeries of the retina and choroid in small animals include retinal or chorioretinal biopsies, and the correction of retinal detachments. The development of the different types of vitreoretinal surgeries in small animals is still early, but these surgeries have been reported since the 1970 s. The expensive instrumentation and time-consuming training have delayed application of vitreoretinal surgical procedures in veterinary ophthalmology. Nevertheless, several institutional veterinary ophthalmology centers offer this highly specialized service. The inclusion of vitreoretinal surgery in this text will hopefully stimulate its continued development in small animals. In horses anterior vitrectomy has been recommended in the treatment of recurrent uveitis, and is used widely in Europe...|$|E
