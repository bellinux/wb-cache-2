We do this by using its rela- tionship to the noncentral F distribution. But first we introduce a new term, the true coefficient of determination. In a simulation study it is feasible to know the true coefficient of determination because the variance of the error term is known. The usefulness of the true coefficient of determination is in the built of relationships with predetermined strength. It answers the question: How much error should we add? The answer depends on how strong we want the association <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>regression</b> model to be. Once we determine this we can compute the noncentrality parameter and explain the distribution of the sample coefficient of determination.

Using a structural equation model of sibling resemblance in educational attainment and occupational status, Hauser and Mossel have found minimal evidence of family bias in the effects of postsecondary schooling on occupational status in a sample of Wisconsin brothers. In order to resolve this seemingly anomalous finding, the present analysis compares the Hauser-Mossel findings with those in larger samples of sibling pairs of the same and of mixed sex in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study and with pairs of brothers in Olneck's Kalamazoo study. In the course of the analysis, some methodological problems in cross-population comparisons of structural equation models are solved. The comparative analysis shows that family bias in the effects of schooling on occupational status may be much less than is commonly believed and that very large samples may be needed to measure it reliably. Moreover, the analysis suggests that estimates of family bias are very sensitive to the specification of response variability in schooling. (Author...|$|E
40|$|Sparsity is an {{essential}} feature of many contemporary data problems. Remote sensing, various forms of automated screening and other high throughput measurement devices collect {{a large amount of}} information, typically about few independent statistical subjects or units. In certain cases {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the underlying process generating the data is itself sparse, in the sense that only a few of the measured variables are involved in the process. We propose an explicit method of monotonically decreasing sparsity for outcomes that can be modelled by an exponential family. In our approach we generalize the equiangular condition in a generalized linear model. Although the geometry involves the Fisher information in a way that is not obvious <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>regression</b> setting, the equiangular condition turns out to be equivalent with an intuitive condition imposed on the Rao score test statistics. In certain special cases the method can be tweaked to obtain L 1 -penalized generalized linear model solution paths, but the method itself defines sparsity more directly. Although the computation of the solution paths is not trivial, the method compares favourably with other path following algorithms. ...|$|E
40|$|Many machine {{learning}} tools for regression {{are based on}} recursive partitioning of the covariate space into smaller regions, where the regression function can be estimated locally. Among these, regression trees and their ensembles have demonstrated impressive empirical performance. In this work, we {{shed light on the}} machinery behind Bayesian variants of these methods. In particular, we study Bayesian regression histograms, such as Bayesian dyadic trees, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>regression</b> case with just one predictor. We focus on the reconstruction of regression surfaces that are piecewise constant, where the number of jumps is unknown. We show that with suitably designed priors, posterior distributions concentrate around the true step regression function at a near-minimax rate. These results do not require the knowledge of the true number of steps, nor the width of the true partitioning cells. Thus, Bayesian dyadic regression trees are fully adaptive and can recover the true piecewise regression function nearly as well as if we knew the exact number and location of jumps. Our results constitute the first step towards understanding why Bayesian trees and their ensembles have worked so well in practice. As an aside, we discuss prior distributions on balanced interval partitions and how they relate to an old problem in geometric probability. Namely, we relate the probability of covering the circumference of a circle with random arcs whose endpoints are confined to a grid, a new variant of the original problem...|$|E

This study assessed the relationship between Mandarin speech reception thresholds (SRTs) and PTTs in the aged and developed SRT as a measure for corroborating PTT. Methods: This prospective study enrolled 46 consecutive subjects over 60 years of age. The results of SRT and PTT were collected from one ear randomly selected from each subject. Simple linear and multiple regressions {{were used to determine}} the correlation and linear regression coefficients between SRTs and PTTs at various frequencies.

In the multiple regression model with SRT as the dependent variable and PTTs as predictor variables, the resultant multiple correlation coefficient R was 0. 967, while R 2 was 0. 936. In this model, PTTs at the frequencies of 500 Hz and 1000 Hz contributed significantly to the variance in SRTs with p values of 0. 029 and < 0. 001, respectively. These results demonstrated that the Mandarin SRT is strongly associated with PTTs at the frequencies of 500 Hz and 1000 Hz.

Objectives. To investigate (1) if nurse students’ experience of stress differs among clinical practice in nursing homes and medical/surgical wards. (2) Whether sense of coherence and stress are associated with quality of life. (3) If sense of coherence acts as a moderator in the relationship between stress and quality of life. Participants. Data were collected from 227 nurse students between January and April 2014. Methods. Questionnaires measuring stress, sense of coherence and quality of life were completed after a period of clinical practice. Linear regression analyses were used to measure associations between stress, and sense of coherence respectively, and quality of life. Results. The results showed that 33. 92 % of the students experienced moderate or high levels of stress, and there was significantly more stress in hospital wards compared to nursing homes (p = 0. 027). Sense of coherence was positively associated with quality of life in the simple and multiple regression analyses (p < 0. 01).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Fatigue is {{a common}} {{complaint}} after stroke. Reasons for higher prevalence are still unclear. This study aimed to determine if fatigue prevalence in stroke patients is different to that of age and gender matched general population controls, and to explore whether early motor activity was associated with reduced likelihood of fatigue three months after stroke. METHODS: This was a prospective multicenter cohort study of stroke patients admitted to eleven regional Norwegian hospitals, within 14 days after stroke. Stroke patients (n = 257) were age and gender matched to participants in a general population health survey (HUNT 3 -survey) carried out in a regional county of central Norway. The single-item fatigue questionnaire from the HUNT 3 -survey was administered to both groups to compare prevalence. The association between early motor activity (time in bed, time sitting out of bed, and time upright) and fatigue at three months after stroke (Fatigue Severity Scale) was tested with logistic regression. Simple models including each activity outcome, with adjustment for stroke severity and pre-stroke function, were tested, {{as well as a}} comprehensive model that included additional independent variables of depression, pain, pre-stroke fatigue, age and gender. RESULTS: Prevalence was higher after stroke compared with the general population: 31. 1 % versus 10. 9 %. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>regression</b> models, none of the early motor activity categories were associated with fatigue three months after stroke. In the comprehensive model, depression, pain and pre-stroke fatigue were significantly associated with post-stroke fatigue. Time in bed through the daytime during hospital stay approached statistical significance (p = 0. 058) with an odds ratio for experiencing fatigue of 1. 02 (95 % CI 1. 00 - 1. 04) for each additional 5. 4 minutes in bed. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke patients had higher prevalence of fatigue three months after stroke than the age and gender matched general population sample, which may be partly explained by the stroke population being in poorer health overall. The relationship between early motor activity (and inactivity) and fatigue remains unclear. Further research, which may help drive development of new treatments to target this challenging condition, is needed...|$|E

The relationship between C-reactive protein and the features of metabolic syndrome has not been fully elucidated. To assess the cross-sectional relationship between C-reactive protein and the features of metabolic syndrome in healthy people. Methods. We studied 161 military pilots (agee, 40 ± 6 years) free of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and active inflammation on their regular annual medical control. Age, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, smoking habit, waist circumference and body mass index were evaluated. Plasma C-reactive protein was measured by the immunonephelometry (Dade Behring) method. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel. Results. The mean C-reactive protein concentrations in the subjects grouped according to the presence of 0, 1, 2 and 3 or more features of the metabolic syndrome were 1. 11, 1. 89, 1. 72 and 2. 22 mg/L, respectively (p = 0. 023) with a statistically, significant difference between those with 3, and without metabolic syndrome (p = 0. 01). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>regression</b> analyses C-reactive protein did not correlate with the total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index and blood pressure (p > 0. 05).

We investigated the sensitivity of five VIs calculated from spectral reflectance: the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), the canopy chlorophyll index (CCI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and the water index (WI). During the monitoring period, clear seasonal variations were not found in LUE, the observed Vls or the phenological timing (particularly new leaf flush) of dominant dipterocarp trees. Although leaf phenology tended to correlate with variations in the CCI, the highest correlation coefficient among the relationships between WE and the VIs was observed in PRI (R = 0. 341, n = 699). Among the relationships between LUE and meteorological factors, the strongest correlation was found between LUE and vapor pressure deficit (VPD; R = - 0580). These results suggest that unseasonal variation in LUE would be more affected by water conditions than leaf phenology or green leaf mass, and that the PRI has lower sensitivity for direct estimation of LUE compared to VPD in this evergreen tropical rainforest. To improve the accuracy in estimating LUE, we examined the potential of combinational use of Vls and meteorological factors. Variable selection by stepwise multiple regression showed that the best variable combination for LUE estimation was the PR! and VPD (R = 0. 612). The relative root mean square error (rRMSE) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>regression</b> models using PR!, VPD and PRI x VPD, and the multiple regression model using PR! and VPD, was 22. 5 %, 19. 4 %, 19. 0 % and 18. 7 %, respectively. Based on these results, we concluded that (1) the estimation method solely based on the PRI {{as in the case of}} other temperate deciduous forests is not suitable in the tropical evergreen rainforest, and (2) the combinational use of the PRI and VPD offers one of the better models for estimating LUE in tropical evergreen rainforests.

40|$|Background: There {{are many}} {{possible}} consequences of discrimination of overweight {{people such as}} stigma and weight-based stereotypes in our society. Examples are higher risk of being single, less opportunity to be hired in the labor market, less opportunity to achieve higher education and to be less desirable as a friend {{in order to have}} social contacts. All these stereotypes in our daily life are harmful to the high Body Mass Index (BMI) individuals and make us behave in a negative way which leads to the discrimination of high BMI individuals and weight - based stereotypes. In my Master thesis I am going to investigate the correlation between BMI as the outcome and independent variables such as civil status, work, social activities, mental health and feeling of discrimination which can be the result of social discrimination of the high BMI target group and I am going to analyze what factors are stronger as the results. Methods: Data was provided by SSB's ”Level of living 2008 - Cross sectional study - Health” (Samordnet levekårsundersøkelse 2008 - Tversnitt Tema: Helse). The main topic of the Level of Living Survey 2008 is health issues such as: symptoms of health problems, functional ability, living habits, use of health services care, social contact. This survey also covered some other issues such as: civil status; work position; social contacts and activities; violence and threat; discrimination; gender; weight and height, which give us opportunity to calculate the BMI as the outcome. Having estimated simple linear regressions for each separate independent variable, I proceeded to estimate a multiple regression, thus investigating the effect of all independent variables together. In order to avoid a very complicated model, I used only those variables that were found significant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>regression</b> analysis, and kept only variables with p-values below 20 % in the final model. The analyses of the data were performed in PASW Statistics (Predictive Analytics Software) formely SPPS. Results: The results of the survey indicate that (i) being a male is associated with an increase in BMI, (ii) being subjected to violence and threat is associated with a decrease in BMI and (iii) having less social contacts and less participating in the cultural activities is associated with an increase in BMI. Interpretation/Conclusion: The results of this study imply that there are certain factors associated with an increase in BMI. Some findings are: being a male is associated with an increase in BMI, being subjected to violence and threat is associated with a decrease in BMI, having less social contacts and less participation in cultural activities is associated with an increase in BMI. However, the study do not support the suggestions that being single, being out of the labor market experiencing general discrimination or having mental problems are associated with higher BMI. In conclusion, not much evidence from data that people with higher BMI are experienced to have problems in everyday life in Norway...|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} this study confirm the {{reported}} results of previous studies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field. <b>Simple,</b> understandable <b>regression</b> techniques with log transformation of attributes perform as well as nonlinear techniques. Moreover, the SMOreg (a support vector machine for regression) and the M 5 P or M 5 R (a reconstruction of Quinlan’s M 5 algorithm for inducing trees of regression models that combines a conventional decision tree with the possibility of linear regression functions at the nodes) present an opportunity to improve some prediction models.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the use of}} a combination of multi-platform satellite observations and statistical data analysis to dramatically improve the correlation between satellite observed aerosol optical depth (AOD) and ground-level retrieved PM 2. 5. The target area is California's San Joaquin Valley which has a history of poor particulate air quality and where such correlations have not yielded good results. We have used MODIS AOD, OMI AOD, AAOD (absorption aerosol optical depth) and NO 2 concentration, and a seasonal parameter in a generalized additive model (GAM) to improve retrieved/observed PM 2. 5 correlations (r 2 at six individual sites and for a data set combining all sites. For the combined data set using the GAM, r 2 improved to 0. 69 compared with an r 2 of 0. 27 for a <b>simple</b> linear <b>regression</b> of MODIS AOD to surface PM. Parameter sensitivities and the effect of multi-platform data on the sample size are discussed. Particularly noteworthy {{is the fact that the}} PM retrieved using the GAM captures many of the PM exceedences that were not seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> linear <b>regression</b> model...|$|R
40|$|Modeling work {{suggests}} that population size affects cultural evolution such that larger populations {{can be expected}} to have richer and more complex cultural repertoires than smaller populations. Empirical tests of this hypothesis, however, have yielded conflicting results. Here, we report a study in which we investigated whether the subsistence toolkits of small-scale food-producers are influenced by population size <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manner the hypothesis predicts. We applied simple linear and standard multiple regression analysis to data from 40 nonindustrial farming and pastoralist groups to test the hypothesis. Results were consistent with predictions of the hypothesis: both the richness and the complexity of the toolkits of the food-producers were positively and significantly influenced by population size <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> linear <b>regression</b> analyses. <b>The</b> multiple regression analyses demonstrated that these relationships are independent of the effects of risk of resource failure, which is the other main factor that has been found to influence toolkit richness and complexity in nonindustrial groups. Thus, our study strongly {{suggests that}} population size influences cultural evolution in nonindustrial food-producing populations...|$|R
