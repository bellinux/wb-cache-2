25|$|In {{the fifth}} match, Hulk Hogan and Shawn Michaels faced Muhammad Hassan and Daivari. Hogan and Hassan began and Hassan was {{immediately}} sent into the turnbuckles. Hogan double clotheslined both his opponents {{and then he}} and Michaels teamed up with a big <b>double</b> <b>boot</b> to Hassan's face. Michaels {{climbed to the top}} rope but missed an elbow drop. Daivari was tossed outside where Hogan bashed him. Michaels hit Daivari with a flying forearm smash and a kip up. Michaels was about to hit Daivari with Sweet Chin Music, but instead Hassan hit Michaels with a lead pipe. Hassan then took advantage and locked Michaels in the Camel Clutch. Michaels fought his way to his feet and dropped Hassan with an Electric Chair. Hogan then got tagged in and went for a leg drop to Daivari, but Hassan hit Hogan with a lead pipe instead. As the referee has his back turned at Hogan, Michaels hit Daivari with Sweet Chin Music allowing Hogan to get the pinfall and win the match for his team.|$|E
50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>boot</b> (also {{known as}} cold <b>double</b> <b>boot,</b> double cold boot, double POST, {{power-on}} auto reboot, or fake boot) is {{a feature of}} the BIOS and may occur after changes to the BIOS settings or the system's configuration, or a power failure while the system was in certain sleep modes.|$|E

50|$|The {{film was}} re-released September 18, 2015 in the United States under its {{original}} title Django il Bastardo from RetroVision Entertainment, LLC as a <b>double</b> bill with <b>Boot</b> Hill. It features both English and Italian dubs.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} aspect of mountaineering boots is warmth. To prevent frostbite in extreme cold conditions, synthetic insulation is incorporated into the boot. Lighter weight boots are classified as single boots. These single boots are insulated as a single unit with the insulation being permanently attached {{to the rest of}} the boot. Double boots, another classification, typically consist of a non-insulated leather or plastic outer shell with a removable insulated liner. The purpose of a <b>double</b> <b>boot</b> is long-term protection from cold weather. If the liner becomes wet, it can be removed from the shell and dried inside a sleeping bag. Since the insulation cannot be removed from single boots, they are not ideally suited for multi-day cold weather excursions.|$|E

5000|$|At around 7.30 am, the {{two police}} {{officers}} and Aimé Perrin arrived at the crime scene, which had already been contaminated multiple times. According to Perrin, Gustave {{arrived on the scene}} on foot and not on his bicycle: he came up behind the police officers, who had just found Lady Anne Drummond’s body. The officers found a 4 cm² shred of skin from a human hand hooked on the car’s rear bumper. This evidence was passed to police chief Edmond Sébeille as soon as he arrived on the scene. The car's front doors had been closed, while the <b>double</b> <b>boot</b> door had been pushed in, with the key left in the lock on the outside, dismissing the theory that Elizabeth Drummond had locked herself in the car from the inside. 6.4 metres behind the rear of the car was a drainage sump. Behind the sump, the police officers noticed a large pool of blood covering about 1 square metre. The blood was never tested, and it was never established whose blood this was. The police found two cartridge cases and two full cartridges, lying in pairs (one cartridge case and one intact cartridge). One pair was found 3 metres behind the car, while the other was found 5 metres perpendicular to the front-left of the car and 1.5 metres away from Lady Anne's body. The two pairs of cartridges/cases were approximately 9 metres away from each other. The cartridge cases were marked [...] "LC4", and were different from the full cartridges, which bore the mark [...] "WCC 43" [...] and [...] "WCC 44". Gustave drew the police officers' attention to the body of Sir Jack Drummond {{on the other side of}} the road, and pointed them to where Elizabeth Drummond's body lay on the riverbank. The two officers discovered shoe prints from crepe shoes. It appeared that the wearer of these shoes had walked away from Elizabeth's body and back again several times. These shoe prints were protected by placing twigs around them and were photographed.|$|E

50|$|After {{returning}} from the disabled list with a start on August 5 at San Diego, he compiled a 10-1 record, and pitched a complete game win against former Cub Greg Maddux {{in the first round}} of the playoffs. The Cubs beat the Atlanta Braves in the first round, but lost to the eventual World Series Champion Florida Marlins in the NLCS, a tightly contested seven game series. Prior, who was the winner in Game 2, was on the mound for the infamous Steve Bartman/Moisés Alou foul ball incident in Game 6. At the time, the Cubs were holding onto a three-run lead in the 8th inning, and were only five outs away from playing in the World Series. Prior struggled with his command and gave up the lead with the aid of poor defensive play, most notably the <b>booted</b> <b>double</b> play grounder and error by shortstop Alex Gonzalez. The Marlins scored eight runs in the 8th inning, winning 8-3 in Game 6, and also went on to win the deciding Game 7 of that NLCS and ultimately beat the New York Yankees in the World Series.|$|R
40|$|Ba c k g r o u n d: Concerns {{have been}} raised about {{findings}} of associations between particulate matter (PM) air pollution and mortality that {{have been based on}} a single “best ” model arising from a model selection procedure, because such a strategy may ignore model uncertainty inherently involved in searching through a set of candidate models to find the best model. Model averaging has been proposed as a method of allowing for model uncertainty in this context. Objectives: To propose an extension (<b>double</b> <b>BOOT)</b> to a previously described bootstrap modelaveraging procedure (BOOT) for use in time series studies of the association between PM and mortality. We compared <b>double</b> <b>BOOT</b> and BOOT with Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and a standard method of model selection [standard Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) ]. Me t h o d: Actual time series data from the United States are used to conduct a simulation study to compare and contrast the performance of <b>double</b> <b>BOOT,</b> BOOT, BMA, and standard AIC. Re s u l t s: <b>Double</b> <b>BOOT</b> produced estimates of the effect of PM on mortality that have had smaller root mean squared error than did those produced by BOOT, BMA, and standard AIC. This performance boost resulted from estimates produced by <b>double</b> <b>BOOT</b> having smaller variance than those produced by BOOTand BMA. Co n c l u s i o n s: <b>Double</b> <b>BOOT</b> is a viable alternative to BOOT and BMA for producing estimates of the mortality effect of PM. Key w o r d s: air pollution, Bayesian, bootstrap, model averaging, mortality, particulate matter. Environ Health Perspect 118 : 131 – 136 (2010). doi: 10. 1289 /ehp. 0901007 available vi...|$|E
50|$|A climber chooses {{equipment}} {{according to}} the slope and texture of the ice. For example, on flat ice, almost any good hiking or mountaineering boot will usually suffice, but for serious ice climbing <b>double</b> plastic mountaineering <b>boots</b> or their stiff leather equivalent are usually used, which must be crampon compatible and stiff enough to support the climber and maintain ankle support. On short, low angled slopes, one can use an ice axe to chop steps. For longer and steeper slopes or glacier travel, crampons are mandatory for a safe climb. Vertical ice climbing is done with crampons and ice axes (those specific to vertical ice generally being called technical ice axes, or ice tools); climbers kick their legs to engage the front points of the crampons in the ice, and then swing the axe into the ice above their heads. This technique is known as front pointing. The strength of the ice is often surprising; even if the axe goes in only a centimeter or so {{it is enough to}} pull up on. If a climber is leading, they will need to place ice screws as protection on the way up (see climbing system). Most mountaineers would only consider the last scenario true ice climbing; the less steep variations are routine aspects of winter mountaineering.|$|R
50|$|The A2 {{had many}} {{innovative}} ideas, {{such as the}} space floor storage system which was a box that slotted in the rear passenger foot well, a rear cup holder which unclipped, and a <b>double</b> (false) floor <b>boot</b> where items could be hidden from thieves or where the space saver spare wheel could be stored. The warning triangle and first aid kit are stowed directly {{to the left of}} the boot opening. The toolkit was stored, depending on equipment, next to the battery. If space was needed for the navigation system and/or the Bose subwoofer, it was moved to the sandwich compartment in front of the right-front seat (driver on UK cars, passenger on LHD ones). The headrests also do not need to be removed from the rear seats when they are folded, and a four-seater can have the rear seats removed in a matter of seconds. The rear seat belts have a clip in the upper section of the c-pillar, so that when the seats are folded and returned to their normal position, the belts do not get tangled.More examples of energy saving can be found in the glovebox light that only turns on when the lights are on and the freewheel pulley on the alternator belt, meaning that the alternator is only used when necessary. The climate compressor is also turned off when the ambient temperature drops below 5 degrees C.The ECON function of the climate control (where fitted) also turns off the auxiliary heating or the compressor, depending on temperature. This functionality is unaffected by the presence of fuel-powered or electrical auxiliary heating.|$|R
