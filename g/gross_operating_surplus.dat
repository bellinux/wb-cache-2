40|$|This paper {{summarised}} {{research into}} the training needs of cane growers in Queensland and Northern New South Wales for the Sugar Research and Development Corporation (SRDC). The full report supplied comprehensive insights into industry training needs {{from the perspective of}} those most directly involved in the production side. As a result of historically low price returns and in some areas, lingering effects of lower than average rainfall, many cane growers are faced with difficult prospects: exiting the industry, seeking to augment incomes by off-farm employment, or diversifying their farming operations. Prior research has shown that farmers undertaking training in other farm business sectors have markedly higher <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>surpluses</b> when compared with those who did not train. Findings from this research revealed a significant unrecognised demand for competency-based training and a need for adoption strategies to be developed and championed at a whole of industry level. By adopting lessons learnt from other industry re-structures, cane growers can maintain their viability from high-level business management training which is not currently offered. The industry is challenged by a need to engage multiple stakeholders and to develop client designed training programs to enable them to remedy farming-related problems...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Operating</b> <b>surplus</b> is a {{component}} of value added and GDP. The term [...] "mixed income" [...] is used when <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> cannot be distinguished from wage income, for example, {{in the case of}} sole proprietorships. Most of <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> will normally consist of gross profit income. In principle, it includes the (separately itemised) increase in the value of output inventories held, with or without a valuation adjustment reflecting average prices during the accounting period.|$|R

The generation of income account details how value added is distributed in the form of labour costs (compensation of employees) and taxes minus subsidies on production. The balance is <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> (plus mixed income in the household sector), which is the surplus or deficit on production activities before interest, rent and income taxes. <b>Gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> is therefore the income which units obtain from their own use of the production facilities.|$|E
50|$|In the {{national}} accounts, <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> (GOS) is {{the portion of}} income derived from production by incorporated enterprises that is earned by the capital factor.

50|$|The ACTU {{campaigned for}} a wage increase. Hawke {{brokered}} an increase for waterside workers and public servants. By April 1991, unemployment was nearing 10% and rising. On 3 June, Keating challenged Hawke for {{the leadership of}} Labor, but lost the vote and became a destabilising presence on the back bench. The new treasurer, John Kerin and deputy prime minister Brian Howe blamed Keating's 1990 economic policy for the poor state of the Australian economy. Industrial Relations Minister Peter Cook indicated an intention to introduce a more flexible wage system. In his July budget, Kerrin forecast a deficit of $4.7 billion. In a press conference, Kerin was unable to recall what GOS - <b>Gross</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Surplus</b> - stood for. In December, shortly before Keating's successful second challenge against Hawke, Kerin was removed as Treasurer and appointed Minister for Transport and Communications and the Minister for Finance, Ralph Willis, became Treasurer. Hawke attributed the change to loss of confidence in communication.|$|E

5000|$|GNI {{is defined}} in {{accordance}} with the European system of national and regional accounts. GNI represents total primary income receivable by resident institutional units: compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, property income (interest, dividends and reinvested earnings from foreign direct investment receivable less payable), <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> and gross mixed income. It corresponds to the better known gross domestic product (GDP) minus primary income payable by resident units to non-resident units, plus primary income receivable by resident units {{from the rest of the}} world. Technically speaking, the GNI is a balancing item of the allocation of primary income account in the sequence of accounts for the total economy. Loosely speaking, it is the sum of domestic and foreign income earned by the resident population of a country. It is worth noting that GNI is income from productive activities excluding any capital gains and losses (also known as [...] "holding gains and losses") resulting from price changes of fixed or financial assets (for example: price changes on the stock market have no direct impact on GNI).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an assessment of}} the changes in the availability of oil and gas resources in Malaysia. The physical and monetary balance sheets for crude oil and natural gas for the period 2000 - 2007 was constructed. The net present value of expected future incomes to reflect the value of resource change was calculated based on a physical extraction and a resource rent scenario. Resource rent is <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> less the estimated user cost of produced capital in the crude oil and natural gas extraction industry. We obtained the <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>surplus</b> by subtracting the value of consumption of employees and net taxes on production cost from the value added of petroleum domestic products. Our findings noted serious reduction of oil reserves from 2001 – 2005, due to changes in crude oil prices, and thereafter the depletion rate decreased. Malaysia has depleted her natural gas reserves mainly in 2004 and 2005. Changes in reserves values were attributable more to price changes and new discoveries. Further, our study shows that the royalty rate paid by the state oil company, Petronas was far less than the estimated resource rent.
