5|$|The {{battle is}} {{highlighted}} by many historians specifically because Lucullus overcame the numerical odds facing his army. The Italian philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli remarked upon {{the battle in}} his book, The Art of War, where he critiqued Tigranes' <b>heavy</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> his cavalry over his infantry.|$|E
5|$|The book's list of {{contents}} reveals Thayer's <b>heavy</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> bird examples, filling 16 of the 27 chapters. Other vertebrates occupy 5 chapters. Insects receive 3 chapters, of which two {{are dedicated to}} lepidoptera - one to caterpillars, one to adult butterflies and moths; the remaining one devotes 14 pages to all other insects, starting with orthoptera including the leaf-mimic grasshoppers.|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} countermeasure to an ABM {{defense is}} to simply {{increase the size of}} the attack. This can be done by adding more ICBMs, by increasing the number of warheads delivered by each ICBM using MIRVs, by using SLBMs (which have a much shorter flight time and are thus difficult to destroy before the terminal phase), or by a <b>heavier</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> bombers and cruise missiles.|$|R
50|$|Storytelling {{and native}} advertisingWith {{companies}} growing into their roster of social media accounts, {{the flood of}} branded content has intensified the contest for viewership {{at the same time}} that attention spans have diminished. The challenge for brands in 2014 is to relate authentically to consumers, which means a <b>heavier</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> eye-catching visuals, content that informs and entertains the viewer, and behind-the-scenes accounts that humanize the brand.|$|R
5|$|Final Fantasy XI has {{a largely}} player-based economy, with a <b>heavy</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> auction houses {{in each of}} the major cities of Vana'diel. There are certain {{economic}} controls in place mainly in the form of fees for putting items up for auction. Transportation, auction house, item storage, and fees do not go to players; these gil sinks effectively remove money from the economy to prevent inflation. The city of Jeuno used to levy a tax on bazaar purchases inside the city, but it was removed in a patch in the December 2008 version update.|$|E
5|$|Although {{operated}} by private companies, the system's fare structure is {{regulated by the}} Public Transport Council (PTC), to which the operators submit requests for changes in fares. Fares are kept affordable by pegging them approximately to distance-related bus fares, thus encouraging commuters to use the network and reduce <b>heavy</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> the bus system. Fare increases {{over the past few}} years have caused public concern, the latest one having taken effect from 1 October 2008. There were similar expressions of disapproval over the slightly higher fares charged on SBS Transit's North East Line, a disparity that SBS Transit justified by citing higher costs of operation and maintenance on a completely underground line, as well as lower patronage.|$|E
5|$|Southey {{uses the}} poem to {{describe}} various superstitions and myths, with a <b>heavy</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> repetition of various themes that link the myths together. Although based in Islamic theology, {{most of the}} action is mechanical instead of emphasising possible moral truths that {{can be drawn from}} the plot. Though the main character is purported to be a Muslim, the story actually takes place thousands of years before Islam, in ancient Babylon. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with some emphasising the strong morality within the work or the quality of the poetry. However, other critics felt that the lack of a strong lyrical structure and the use of Middle Eastern myths detracted from the poem.|$|E

We show that industries with a relatively <b>heavier</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> external finance or lower asset tangibility tend to grow faster (in terms of both value added and of labor productivity growth) in countries that implement fiscal policies that are more countercyclical. We reach this conclusion using Rajan and Zingales׳s (1998) difference-in-difference methodology on a panel data sample of manufacturing industries across 15 OECD countries over the period 1980 – 2005...|$|R

5|$|Switzerland's {{ecosystems}} can {{be particularly}} fragile, because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies. The mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable, with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes, and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing. The climatic, geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change. Nevertheless, according to the 2014 Environmental Performance Index, Switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment, due to its high scores on environmental public health, its <b>heavy</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> {{renewable sources of energy}} (hydropower and geothermal energy), and its control of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
5|$|Medieval vernacular {{architecture}} utilised local building materials, including cruck constructed houses, turf walls and clay, with a <b>heavy</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> stone. Medieval parish church architecture was typically simpler than in England, {{but there were}} grander ecclesiastical buildings in the Romanesque and Gothic styles. From the early fifteenth century, the introduction of Renaissance styles included the selective use of Romanesque forms in church architecture, as in the nave of Dunkeld Cathedral. Castles arrived in Scotland {{with the introduction of}} feudalism in the twelfth century. Initially these were wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, but many were replaced by stone castles with a high curtain wall. In the late Middle Ages, new castles were built, some on a grander scale, and others, particularly in the borders, as simpler tower houses. Gunpowder weaponry led to the use of gun ports, platforms to mount guns and walls adapted to resist bombardment. There was a phase of Renaissance palace building from the late fifteenth century, beginning at Linlithgow.|$|E
5|$|The modern form of {{ice hockey}} is {{generally}} considered to have begun in the mid-19th century. One of the first games to use a puck was played {{by a group of}} Englishmen from the Royal Canadian Rifle Regiment in Kingston, Ontario. In the United Kingdom, a five team league was established in 1903, while Great Britain was one of the founding members of the International Ice Hockey Federation five years later. The game was first administrated by the British Ice Hockey Association, from 1914 until 1999, when Ice Hockey UK took over. In {{the early part of the}} 20th century the Great Britain national team enjoyed some success: they won gold at the 1936 Olympics, improving on their result of bronze twelve years earlier; won medals at three World Championships (bronze in 1935, and silver in 1937 and 1938), and won the first European Championships in 1910. The British team's <b>heavy</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> Canadian-trained players during its 1936 Olympic run was especially controversial, and prompted a protest from Canadian hockey officials.|$|E
50|$|In moving west {{into the}} prairies, the {{lifestyle}} of the Sioux would be greatly altered, coming to resemble that of a nomadic northern plains tribe {{much more so than}} a largely settled eastern woodlands one. Characteristics of this transformation include a greater dependence on the bison for food, a <b>heavier</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> the horse for transportation, and the adoption of the tipi for habitation, a dwelling more suited to the frequent movements of a nomadic people than their earlier semi-permanent lodges.|$|R
50|$|For {{road signs}} in Canada, the Transportation Association of Canada (TAC) publishes its own Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Canada {{for use by}} Canadian jurisdictions. Although it serves a similar role to the FHWA MUTCD, it has been {{independently}} developed and {{has a number of}} key differences with its US counterpart, most notably the inclusion of bilingual (English/French) signage for jurisdictions such as New Brunswick and Ontario with significant anglophone and francophone population, and a <b>heavier</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> symbols rather than text legends.|$|R
5000|$|Lucky Stars Go Places was {{an attempt}} to combine the styles and {{characters}} of the two film series'. Hung remained involved, producing the film and playing a supporting role, {{and other members of the}} original Lucky Stars gang made cameo appearances. However, the main roles were taken by other actors, a new group of [...] "Lucky Stars" [...] - notably including Andy Lau and Alan Tam. With fewer action scenes and a <b>heavier</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> comedy, the film was significantly different from its predecessors.|$|R
5|$|Altdorfer's primary {{point of}} {{reference}} in his research was probably Hartmann Schedel's Nuremberg Chronicle (Schedelsche Weltchronik), an illustrated world history published in Nuremberg in 1493. Schedel was a physician, humanist, historian and cartographer, and his Chronicle {{was one of the}} first books produced on the printing press. With a <b>heavy</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> the Bible, it recounts the seven ages of human history, from Creation to the birth of Christ and ending with the Apocalypse. Altdorfer's statistics for the battle of Issus mirror those of Schedel. Furthermore, the errors in Schedel's maps of the Mediterranean and Northern Africa are also present in The Battle of Alexander at Issus: the island of Cyprus is noticeably oversized, and both the mountain rise in the painting's centre and the range adjacent to the Nile do not exist. Since the Chronicle describes Alexander's victory over the Persians in terms of its proximity to Tarsus and omits mention of Issus, it is likely that the cityscape by the sea is intended to be the former city rather than the latter. Issus in the 16th century was minor and relatively unknown, whereas Tarsus was renowned for its having been a major centre of learning and philosophy in Roman times. Tarsus was also said to be the birthplace of the Apostle Paul, which may explain the presence of the church towers in Altdorfer's portrayal. Another source may have been the writings of Quintus Curtius Rufus, a 1st-century Roman historian who presents inflated figures for the number of killed and taken prisoner and the sizes of the armies.|$|E
25|$|As of September 2013 the U.S. {{military}} is flying {{out a large}} amount of gear instead of using cheaper overland and sea routes, while U.S. officials declined to elaborate on the reasons for their <b>heavy</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> the more expensive methods of transport.|$|E
25|$|Lack of {{understanding}} about technological accessibility {{for the deaf}} causes conflict and injustice for the deaf community.

Little Moments featured a new sound for the band that included a <b>heavier</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> synths and drum machines and fewer guitars. The band recorded the EP in Alec Ounsworth's home studio, mixing and mastering the EP themselves. Additionally, 500 10 inch vinyl EPs were put on sale on the band's Bandcamp page.|$|R
25|$|Joseph Campbell {{describes}} {{yellow press}} newspapers as having daily multi-column front-page headlines covering {{a variety of}} topics, such as sports and scandal, using bold layouts (with large illustrations and perhaps color), <b>heavy</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> unnamed sources, and unabashed self-promotion.

25|$|Despite New York's <b>heavy</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> {{its vast}} public transit system, streets are a {{defining}} {{feature of the}} city. Manhattan's street grid plan greatly influenced the city's physical development.

25|$|China, due {{in large}} part to {{environmental}} concerns, has wanted to shift China's current energy mix from a <b>heavy</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> coal, which accounts for 70–75% of China's energy, toward greater reliance on oil, natural gas, renewable energy, and nuclear power. China has closed thousands of coal mines over the past five to ten years to cut overproduction. According to Chinese statistics, this has reduced coal production by over 25%.|$|E

40|$|The author {{examines}} {{aspects of}} Canada's trade performance {{in light of}} the major trends seen in world trade over the past several decades. Canada has become more integrated with the world economy, and this openness is evident from its greater export orientation, its <b>heavier</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> imported inputs, and more exposure to foreign competition in its domestic markets. The author analyzes the composition of Canadian trade and the trend towards increasing two-way trade in similar products. He also looks at the increasing integration of trade within regions, which for Canada has meant a greater concentration of exports with the United States. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{music on}} this album is quite {{different}} from Tangerine Dream’s first album Electronic Meditation, partly because of a <b>heavier</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> keyboards and electronic technology, although they still mostly remain in the background: the dominant instruments on the album are organ and flute. The other difference is that this album focuses on dark, spacey soundscapes as opposed to jam sessions. The shift in instrumentation resulted in an atmosphere dubbed by Edgar Froese himself as [...] "kosmische musik". Julian Cope's Head Heritage wrote that the album [...] "used the space rock template fromPink Floyd's A Saucerful of Secrets (and removed the rock)".|$|R
5000|$|The band {{followed}} Fly by Night {{quickly with}} Caress of Steel (1975), a five-track album featuring two extended multi-chapter songs, [...] "The Necromancer" [...] and [...] "The Fountain of Lamneth". Some critics said Caress of Steel was unfocused and an audacious move {{for the band}} because of the placement of two back-to-back protracted songs, {{as well as a}} <b>heavier</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> atmospherics and story-telling, a large deviation from Fly by Night. Intended to be the band's break-through album, Caress of Steel sold below expectations and the promotional tour consisted of smaller venues, which led to the moniker the [...] "Down the Tubes Tour".|$|R
