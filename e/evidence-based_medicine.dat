5|$|A {{development}} {{in recent years}} that seeks to address these issues has been termed <b>evidence-based</b> <b>medicine.</b> As its name suggests, this approach strives to rigorously study the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition. Jeffrey Arnold argues that its application worldwide could lead to the boon of sharing best practices between emergency medicine practitioners in various countries, thus advancing the current standard of emergency care.|$|E

5|$|Life {{expectancy}} {{at birth}} {{is estimated to}} be 54.71 years in 2012, among the lowest in the world. Endemic diseases include dengue fever, filariasis, leishmaniasis, malaria, meningitis, schistosomiasis, and sleeping sickness. The HIV/AIDS seroprevalence rate is estimated at 5.4% for those aged 15–49, although a strong stigma against the illness keeps the number of reported cases artificially low. Breast ironing, a traditional practice that is prevalent in Cameroon, may affect girls' health.

5|$|Changes {{in the way}} {{research}} ethics was visualised in {{the wake}} of the Nuremberg Trials (1946), led to an atmosphere of protectionism of groups deemed to be vulnerable that was often legislated or regulated. This resulted in the relative underrepresentation of women in clinical trials. The position of women in research was further compromised in 1977, when in response to the tragedies resulting from thalidomide and diethylstilbestrol (DES), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited women of child bearing years from participation in early stage clinical trials. In practice this ban was often applied very widely to exclude all women. Women, at least those in the child bearing years, were also deemed unsuitable research subjects due to their fluctuating hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle. However, research has demonstrated significant biological differences between the sexes in rates of susceptibility, symptoms and response to treatment in many major areas of health, including heart disease and some cancers. These exclusions pose a threat to the application of <b>evidence-based</b> <b>medicine</b> to women, and compromise to care offered to both women and men.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} an evidence-based course in complementary medicines on the attitudes, knowledge, and professional practice behavior of undergraduate pharmacy students. Design. A required 12 -week <b>evidence-based</b> complementary <b>medicine</b> course was designed and introduced into the third-year undergraduate pharmacy curriculum. The course included a combination of traditional lectures, interactive tutorial sessions, {{and a range of}} formal assessments. Assessment. Pre- and post-course survey instruments were administered to assess changes in students’ attitudes, perceptions, knowledge, and the likelihood they would recommend the use of complementary medicines in a pharmacy practice environment. Conclusion. Completion of a required <b>evidence-based</b> complementary <b>medicines</b> course resulted in a positive change in pharmacy students’ perceptions of the value of various complementary medicines as well as in their willingness to recommend them, and provided students with the required knowledge to make patient-centered recommendations for use of complementary medicines in a professional pharmacy practice setting.

5|$|McMaster has {{received}} accolades for its research strengths, {{particularly in the}} field of health sciences. For five years in a row, McMaster has ranked second in for biomedical and health care research revenues by the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada. The Faculty of Health Science oversees $130 million a year in research, much of that research conducted by scientists and physicians who teach in the medical school. The Faculty of Health Sciences operates several research institutes, including the Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health, and the Population Health Research Institute. A McMaster research group led by David Sackett and later Gordon Guyatt had been credited for establishing the methodologies used in <b>evidence-based</b> <b>medicine.</b> In November 2010, researchers at the Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute turned clumps of human skin into blood cells, which may help alleviate the shortage of blood donors. A portion of Albert Einstein's brain is preserved and held for medical research at the McMaster brain bank. Researchers there have identified differences in his brain that may relate to his genius for spatial and mathematical thinking.|$|E
5|$|Some {{challenges}} faced in international emergency medicine include immature or non-existent training programs, {{a lack of}} adequate emergency transport, a shortage of resources to fund emergency medicine development, and an absence of research that could inform developing countries how to best spend the resources they devote to emergency medicine. Additionally, the standards and methods used in countries with mature EMSs are not always suited for use in developing countries {{due to a lack}} of infrastructure, shortage of funds, or local demographics. Ambulances, the developed country standard, are costly and not practical for the road conditions present in many countries; instead, a variety of modes of transportation are used. Furthermore, in place of expensive medication and equipment, developing countries often opt for cheaper if slightly less effective alternatives. Although it may seem that increasing availability to emergency medicine must improve health, there is little empirical evidence to directly support that claim or to point out which methods are most effective in improving patient health. <b>Evidence-based</b> <b>medicine</b> seeks to address this issue by rigorously studying the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition.|$|E

40|$|Current {{guidelines}} in heart failure recommend ‘add-on’ prescribing of <b>evidence-based</b> <b>medicines</b> {{aimed at improving}} symptoms and prognosis. Heart failure patients therefore commonly receive multiple drug therapies and this ‘polypharmacy’ is set to increase with the recognition of new potential drug targets. Drug regimes in heart failure are further complicated by increasing age {{and high levels of}} comorbidity inherent in this patient group. Nurses are central to the patient's care pathway and the commencement and titration of medicines are key component sof the patient's management plan. The development of nursing specialism in heart failure alongside independent prescribing have further extended nurse's responsibilities. Polypharmacy is an important consideration for nursing and this article provides an overview of the development of drug therapies in heart failure as well as the scope of polypharmacy for this group. The key implications of polypharmacy in heart failure will be explored, including side effects, drug interactions, prescription errors, optimal clinical prescribing and patient adherence.

Recent Findings Pharmacists are contributing to heart failure management in a variety of settings, including hospitals, clinics, and communities. Different interventions which may be mediated by the pharmacist include drug adherence, discharge counseling, medication reconciliation, telephone follow-up, and recommendation of <b>evidence-based</b> <b>medicines.</b> Summary Pharmacist engagement in heart failure management has demonstrated improved drug adherence, readmission rates, medication management, self-care ability, patient satisfaction, and heart failure knowledge. Some findings are mixed, especially for readmission rates. Improved medication management was reported in nearly all studies, despite significant heterogeneity in the models of care, patient populations, and study designs. This review highlights the requirement for large randomized trials with extended follow-up to confirm the impact {{of the role of the}} pharmacist in HF self-care, particularly through multidisciplinary-based interventions...|$|R

40|$|Purpose and setting: The Finnish Medicines Agency was {{mandated}} {{to develop a}} national medicines information strategy. The objectives {{of this study were}} to assess stakeholders’ views on strengths,challenges and opportunities in medicines information for the basis of the strategy. Methods: Interviews among stakeholder representatives (n = 28) from patient organizations, universities, pharmacies,and professional associations in medicine, pharmacy and nursing were conductedin 2011. Interviewmemos were thematically content-analysed. The draft strategy was finalized through two public hearings and a public consultation. Results: Stakeholders highlighted the need to increase cooperation and coordination in medicines information. The existence of numerous quality-and <b>evidence-based</b> <b>medicines</b> information sources was identified as astrength; although the stakeholders were con- cerned about the fragmented and unequal access to them. The strengthening of the role of health care professionals in communicating about medicines was seen as an opportunity, but its realization requires improvements in basic and continuing education. Furthermore, the stakeholders emphasized the importance of uniform medicines information regardless of source. Conclusions: Stakeholders identified multiple strengths,challenges and opportunities in medicines information that were fundamental to developing the national medicines infor- mation strategy.
