40|$|This study evaluates various {{alternatives}} {{to account for}} flood plain conveyance in steady compound channel flows. Evaluations are based on applying several traditional discharge estimation methods to a steady, uniform flow laboratory data set. Many of the applied techniques overestimate compound channel discharge. Six interface and two other standard methods for computing discharge in open channels were compared. Each interface method uses a particular arrangement of imaginary interface planes to artificially sub-divide the compound flow field into homogeneous zones. These methods are named for the particular <b>interface</b> <b>plane</b> arrangement adopted. The two standard methods do not involve interface planes. In general, among the methods tested, the outward-facing diagonal <b>interface</b> <b>plane</b> method and the vertical <b>interface</b> <b>plane</b> method produced the most accurate simulations.

40|$|The present {{research}} investigates the numerical modelling aspects of unsteady flow in compound channels, with {{special interest in}} the "flood plain conveyance" aspects. This is examined through applications of three unsteady flow dynamic routing models: DWOPER, EXTRAN, and ONE-D to both laboratory and field data sets. In the context of applying DWOPER to the data sets three different approaches to define "off-channel" storage areas were considered. The first, which viewed the composite flow field as a single hydraulic unit without storage, produced significant differences between simulated and observed stage and discharge hydrographs. The second and third options separated the shallow and deep zones of the compound flow fields using different types of (imaginary) <b>interface</b> <b>planes.</b> The second option, which considered vertical <b>interface</b> <b>planes,</b> gave generally good results for the laboratory data but was less successful when applied to the field data. The third option used diagonal <b>interface</b> <b>planes</b> to define flood plain storage areas. The inclination of the diagonal plane to the horizontal (Θ) was adjusted to reflect changing hydraulic conditions. The form of the simulated hydrographs using this particular approach {{was found to be}} sensitive to variations in Θ. Statistical analyses were performed to determine optimum Θ-values {{for a wide range of}} hydraulic conditions. Finally, an equation was developed to define the flood plain hydraulic boundaries.

40|$|The {{properties}} of interfaces depend {{not only on}} the lattice misorientation, but also on the <b>interface</b> <b>plane</b> orientation.

The PFTF is a unique pylon that was developed for flight-testing propulsion-related experiments such as inlets, nozzles, and combustors over a range of subsonic and supersonic flight conditions. The objective of the RAGE program was to quantify the local flowfield at the aerodynamic <b>interface</b> <b>plane</b> of the Channeled Centerbody Inlet Experiment (CCIE). The CCIE is a fixed representation of a conceptual mixed-compression supersonic inlet with a translating biconic centerbody. The primary goal of RAGE was to identify the relationship between free-stream and local Mach number in the low supersonic regime, with emphasis on {{the identification of the}} particular free-stream Mach number that produced a local Mach number of 1. 5. Measurements of the local flow angularity, total pressure distortion, and dynamic pressure over the <b>interface</b> <b>plane</b> were also desired. The experimental data for the RAGE program were obtained during two separate research flights. During both flights, local flowfield data were obtained during straight and level acceleration segments out to steady-state test points. The data obtained from the two flights showed small variations in Mach number, flow angularity, and dynamic pressure across the <b>interface</b> <b>plane</b> at all flight conditions. The data show that a free-stream Mach number of 1. 65 will produce the desired local Mach number of 1. 5 for CCIE. The local total pressure distortion over the <b>interface</b> <b>plane</b> at this condition was approximately 1. 5 %.

40|$|River {{engineers}} often {{analyze the}} overbank fl ows using subdivision techniques through {{the selection of}} assumed <b>interface</b> <b>planes.</b> A wrong selection of <b>interface</b> <b>planes</b> between the main channel and fl oodplain accounts for transfer of improper momentum, which inculcates error in estimation of discharge for compound channel sec-tion. Distribution of apparent shear stress between the main channel and fl oodplain gives an insight into the magnitude of momentum transfer based on which the discharge estimation using divided channel methods is decided. In the present study, experimental results of momentum transfer at various interface plains for straight and meandering compound channels are presented. Momentum transfer and boundary shear distribution {{are found to be}} dependent on the dimensionless parameters viz., overbank fl ow depth ratio, width ratio, sinuosity, and the orientation of the interfaces. The developed equation helps to predict the discharge carried by com-pound channels of different geometry and sinuosity. The present study indicates that for a straight compound channel, the horizontal division method provides better discharge results for low overbank fl ow depth and diagonal division method is good for higher overbank fl ow depths. The best discharge results for a meandering compound channel are obtained through diagonal division method for low overbank fl ow depths and vertical division method is good for higher overbank fl ow depths. The adequacies of the present results are verifi ed using present experimental data, and the data collected from the large channel facility (FCF) at Wallingford, UK.
