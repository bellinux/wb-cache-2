The quality of the Test sides usually runs in cycles.

After all, I cut those scenes out for a reason back in 1979. However, {{in the interest of}} giving the fans a new experience with Alien, I figured there had to be an appropriate middle ground. I chose to go in and recut that proposed long version into a more streamlined and polished alternate version of the film. For marketing purposes, this version is being called [...] "The Director's Cut." ...|$|E

Bush said, [...] "Originally when I wrote the song 'The Sensual World', I had used text {{from the end}} of Ulysses. When I asked for permission to use the text I was refused, which was disappointing. I then wrote my own lyrics for the song, although <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original idea had been more interesting. Well, I'm not James Joyce am I? When I came to work on this project I thought I would ask for permission again and this time they said yes." ...|$|E

Despite her desire {{to work closely with}} Austen's dialogue, Wright made an effort to not [...] "be too reverential to [...] I don't believe people spoke like that then; it's not natural." [...] While a few scenes, such as the discussion over accomplished women, aligned closely with the author's original dialogue, many others [...] "substituted instead a mixture of modern idiom and archaic-sounding sentence structure". One alteration concerned politeness; Wright noted that while Austen's work had characters waiting before speaking, he believed that [...] "particularly in big families of girls, everyone tends to speak over each other, finishing each other's sentences, etc. So <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bennet family's conversations would be overlapping like that." [...] Sense and Sensibility actress and screenwriter Emma Thompson aided in script development, though she opted to be uncredited. She advised the nervous director about adapting Austen for the screen and made dialogue recommendations, such as with parts of the Collins-Charlotte storyline.|$|E
500|$|In November 2008, he {{was again}} sent out on loan, {{this time to}} Bournemouth, also in League Two, for one month. Simpson said: [...] "We have a big squad and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{opportunity}} for Michael {{to go and get}} a month out on loan at Bournemouth would do him the world of good." [...] Symes made his debut for Bournemouth on 15 November, as they lost 3–0 to Accrington Stanley. He returned to Shrewsbury {{at the end of his}} month loan spell, in which he failed to score from five appearances. He was immediately recalled to the Shrewsbury squad and came on as a second-half substitute in a 1–0 defeat to league leaders Wycombe Wanderers the following weekend. Because of injury problems, Symes played only three more games, before he moved on loan, this time to Accrington Stanley, another League Two side. He made his Accrington debut the day following his transfer, helping them to a 2–1 victory at home to Exeter City. Symes scored with a headed goal to give Accrington a 1–0 victory against Grimsby Town, which proved to be the only goal he recorded in seven games for Accrington, before he returned to Shrewsbury Town at the end of the season. However, he was one of seven players released by Simpson after they lost the play-off final.|$|E

Jennifer Garner has stated that the film was shot very quickly over just 25 days and has remarked that McConaughey [...] "gave an even wilder performance in takes that didn't appear onscreen". McConaughey stated that [...] "I was riding {{a new way of}} making a film. There were no lights, one camera, 15-minute takes." [...] Half of the shots were lit with artificial light and the other half were not. Vallée said: [...] "I now had a perfect opportunity to try to shoot an entire movie without artificial lights, using the Alexa digital camera. Like the RED, the Alexa offers a broad spectrum of colors and shadows in even the darkest natural lighting conditions. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> approach was right for this project. The look and feel became that we were capturing reality; even though Dallas Buyers Club is not a documentary in content or structure, it could have that subtle quality. We shot the movie 100% handheld with two lenses, a 35-millimeter and a 50-millimeter. These get close to the actors and don't skew the images. (Director of Photography) Yves Belanger adjusted for every shot at 400 or 1600 ASA (light sensitivity), displaying different color balance." ...|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Director's Cut" [...] {{restored}} roughly {{four minutes}} of deleted footage while cutting {{about five minutes}} of other material, leaving it about a minute shorter than the theatrical cut. Many of the changes were minor, such as altered sound effects, while the restored footage included the scene in which Ripley discovers the cocooned Dallas and Brett during her escape of the Nostromo. Fox released the Director's Cut in theaters on October 31, 2003. The Alien Quadrilogy box set was released December 2, 2003, with both versions of the film included along with a new commentary track featuring many of the film's actors, writers, and production staff, {{as well as other}} special features and a documentary entitled The Beast Within: The Making of Alien. Each film was also released separately as a DVD with both versions of the film included. Scott noted that he was very pleased with the original theatrical cut of Alien, saying that [...] "For all intents and purposes, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original cut of Alien was perfect. I still feel that way", and that the original 1979 theatrical version [...] "remains my version of choice". He has since stated that he considers both versions [...] "director's cuts", as he feels that the 1979 version was the best he could possibly have made it at the time.|$|E
500|$|The {{script was}} written by Jerry Gracio, {{influenced}} by the poem The Hound of Heaven, and won first prize at the scriptwriting competition hosted by the Film Development Council of the Philippines in 2000. This {{attracted the attention of}} Laurice Guillen, who bought the script (the first time in her career that she had done so) and signed on to direct the eventual film. The script was brought to Star Cinema, who became interested in producing it, but production stalled due to difficulties finding an appropriate actress to play Malen. Guillen stated that [...] "Since she was a Magdalene, she had to be sexy but she also had to be much more than that....I was shown many sexy actresses, some of them name stars, but I couldn't find my Santa-Santita. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> role should go to someone relatively new, who had no fixed image, so {{that there would be no}} expectations". An additional problem was over the religious content of the film, which met with controversy. Guillen eventually found Angelica Panganiban to play Malen, and after five years without production, work on the film began for Unitel Pictures International, whose CEO stated that [...] "the majority of Filipinos, the so-called masses, are not the targets of this movie. Those who frequent the cineplexes and look for fresh material in the movies are". The title, Santa Santita, translates as [...] "saint who is not really a saint".|$|E

2500|$|Although Brach {{began writing}} the {{screenplay}} in late 1981, Annaud took on another project, that of directing a film adaptation of Umberto Eco's book The Name of the Rose. Between preparing for and filming his next film, Annaud traveled and visited zoos {{in order to}} research animal behavior. In an interview he later gave with the American Humane Association, Annaud stated: [...] "Each time I was fascinated with the tigers, {{to a point that}} I thought to do a movie called The Tiger instead of The Bear. In those days <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bear, because they're so often vertical, would give me a better identification, or would provide more instant identification from the viewers." [...] The finished script was presented to Berri in early 1983.|$|E

That who she was, was getting lost. I went back several times and they were so lovely to let me come back and play a character I love with the people I love so many times. But <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people making the show didn’t really understand what Bianca was about anymore... It troubled me. I got letters from people to whom Bianca meant a great deal essentially saying, [...] "Please don’t come back. We can't take it anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|In season 2, the {{basketball}} drama was completely {{removed from the}} series, as executives felt that the show was geared more toward a male audience. David Janollari, then entertainment president at The WB, attributed the show's sophomore success partly to its shift in focus from a male-driven sports plot to expanding the stories of its girls. He felt they had time to [...] "step back and learn from audience response" [...] and that Schwahn tailored the show toward the [...] "core audience". Schwahn said, [...] "Girls watch the show in large numbers. , the girls were sort of appendages to the boys." [...] Show producer Joe Davola and Schwahn agreed with the [...] "sex sells" [...] and [...] "skin to win" [...] sentiments. Less time on {{the basketball}} court could afford One Tree Hill more time for plots fueled by sex and drugs. Lack of basketball drama, however, meant a decrease in male viewership. In a 2006 interview, Schwahn said, [...] "In the second TV season, we didn't play any basketball, which was the rest of their junior year, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> show suffered a little bit." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{style of}} film is {{presented}} in a nonlinear narrative. Each scene is introduced using a title card showing which of the 500 days it is. Co-writer of the film Scott Neustadter admitted the film {{was based on a}} real romance. Neustadter explains that when he met the real girl who inspired the character Summer as a student at the London School of Economics in 2002, he was rebounding from a bad breakup back home, and promptly fell [...] "crazily, madly, hopelessly in love" [...] with the girl who [...] "returned his kisses but not his ardor." [...] The ending of the relationship was [...] "painfully and unforgettably awful," [...] which prompted him to co-write the film with Michael H. Weber. When Neustadter later showed the script to Summer's real life counterpart, she said she related more to the Tom character. Weber also stated that, [...] "we've all been in the trenches of love, we've all gone through the highs and lows, so Scott and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only way to tell this story was to come at it from a completely real place. It was pretty interesting for us because Scott was just going through a break-up and I was in a long-term relationship, so we each brought a totally opposite perspective, living it and not living it, and I think that tension helped to bring out more of the comedy".|$|E
2500|$|During My Life, Stark Hesseltine told Reeve that he {{had been}} asked to {{audition}} for the leading role as Clark Kent/Superman in the big budget film, Superman (1978). Lynn Stalmaster, the casting director, put Reeve's picture and résumé {{on the top of the}} pile three separate times, only to have the producers throw it out each time. Through Stalmaster's persistent pleading, a meeting between director Richard Donner, producer Ilya Salkind, and Reeve was set in January 1977 at the Sherry Netherland Hotel on Fifth Avenue. The morning after the meeting, Reeve was sent a 300-page script. He was thrilled that the script took the subject matter seriously, and that Richard Donner's motto was verisimilitude. Reeve immediately flew to London for a screen test, and on the way was told that Marlon Brando was going to play Jor-El and Gene Hackman was going to play Lex Luthor. Reeve still did not think he had much of a chance. Though standing , he was a self-described [...] "skinny WASP." [...] On the plane ride to London, he imagined how his approach to the role would be. He later said, [...] "By the late 1970s, the masculine image had changed... Now it was acceptable for a man to show gentleness and vulnerability. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new Superman ought to reflect that contemporary male image." [...] He based his portrayal of Clark Kent on Cary Grant in his role in Bringing Up Baby. After the screen test, his driver said, [...] "I'm not supposed to tell you this, but you've got the part." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following on from Martin Kemp's {{decision}} to quit EastEnders, Outhwaite announced she was quitting the soap {{in the autumn}} of 2001, stating, [...] "I'm not sure what was left for Mel to do after she had been kidnapped, been married twice, burnt down a club and slept with her best friend's husband [...] To be honest with you, Mel's role in EastEnders has come to a kind of natural end. I always said I'd go when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> character had run her course, and I'm going to leave when my contract runs out next year [...] Martin and I are in very similar situations with our characters. We came in at a similar time, and now it looks like we'll leave at a similar time, too. Mel and Steve had some kind of aura, a chemistry, that was unique. I was really proud of it." [...] She added, [...] "I'll always be indebted to EastEnders for providing me with a wonderful start to my career on television and the opportunity to play a character like Mel has been fabulous. I felt {{it was time to move}} on and try on a new coat – new characters, new challenges." [...] EastEnders executive producer John Yorke said of Outhwaite's departure, [...] "Tamzin has created one of the most-loved characters and (with Martin Kemp) one half of the most-admired on-screen couple in EastEnders since the show started. She has been fantastic to work with and we wish her all the luck in her career." [...] Yorke added that the character would be welcome back any time.|$|E
