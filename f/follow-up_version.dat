5|$|Both Murphy and Universal gave serious {{considerations}} to a <b>follow-up</b> <b>version</b> of his post-war life. Murphy {{rejected the}} Richard J. Collins script The Way Back which created the fictional scenario that filming To Hell and Back {{had been so}} therapeutic for Murphy that it cured him of his combat fatigue. Spec McClure scripted a second unused version of The Way Back that incorporated Murphy's real-life friends into the storyline and ended with the star living happily ever after with Pamela and their two sons. A third version by an unknown writer focused on the Murphy-McClure friendship and {{was rejected by the}} threat of a lawsuit from McClure. Desi Arnaz offered to bankroll a 1965 project titled Helmets in the Dust. At Murphy's request McClure wrote a film treatment, but the project never came to fruition.|$|E

5000|$|MacApp {{was perhaps}} the first truly usable {{framework}} in all meanings of the term. Compiled applications were quite reasonable in terms of size and memory footprint, and the performance was not bad enough to make developers shy from it. Although [...] "too simple" [...] in its first releases, a number of <b>follow-up</b> <b>versions</b> quickly addressed the main problems. By this point, around 1987, the system had matured into a useful tool, {{and a number of}} developers started using it on major projects. Given the small memory sizes and slow speeds of machines of the era, however, even the small overhead of MacApp was considered a bother, and developer uptake was not particularly widespread.|$|R

Initial work was published on the WWDC CDs, {{as well as a number}} of <b>follow-up</b> <b>versions</b> on later developer CDs. A component document system would only work with a known document format that all the components could use, and so soon the standardized document format was pulled into the component software effort.

While the BASIC dialect used was quite powerful and well-optimized (it was actually a somewhat scaled-down clone of MSX BASIC), the keyboard was a mixed blessing. While {{it was much more}} comfortable to work with, its quality left much to be desired, and the keys were prone to sticking, significant bounce and wore quickly, though a model with a further improved keyboard became available later.

40|$|Background. The Self-Assessment of Treatment version II (SAT II) {{measures}} treatment-related {{improvements in}} pain and impacts and impressions of treatment in neuropathic pain patients. The measure has baseline and <b>follow-up</b> <b>versions.</b> This study assesses the measurement properties of the SAT II. Methods. Data from 369 painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN) patients from a phase III trial assessing capsaicin 8 % patch (Qutenza®) efficacy and safety were used in these analyses. Reliability, convergent validity, known-groups validity, and responsiveness (using the Brief Pain Inventory-Diabetic Neuropathy [BPI-DN] and Patient Global Impression of Change [PGIC]) analyses were conducted, and minimally important differences (MID) were estimated. Results. Exploratory factor analysis supported a one-factor solution for the six impact items. The SAT II has good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha: 0. 96) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients: 0. 62 – 0. 88). Assessment of convergent validity showed moderate to strong correlations with change in other study endpoints. Scores varied significantly by level of pain intensity and sleep interference (p< 0. 05) defined by the BPI-DN. Responsiveness was shown based on the PGIC. MID estimates ranged from 1. 2 to 2. 4 (pain improvement) and 1. 0 to 2. 0 (impact scores). Conclusions. The SAT II is a reliable and valid measure for assessing treatment improvement in PDPN patients...|$|R

40|$|Biosimilars are <b>follow-up</b> <b>versions</b> of {{innovative}} medicines with proved high similarity to the reference product. There {{may be some}} minor differences in clinically inactive components of a molecule which can be clinically significant, {{but they do not}} substantially affect the high resemblance to the original drug in their safety and potency. Introduction of the biosimilars brings hope to reduce the cost of treatment, so their availability will increase further as the expiration of patents on biotechnologically produced drugs will follow, which is currently taking place. There are new biosimilar drugs being introduced recently; these are monoclonal antibodies. They are much more structurally complicated compared to the first biotech drugs such as insulin, and their production processes are much more complex. Biosimilars as the end products of such sophisticated technology are affected by many variables. It is not possible to create “biogenerics,” but only biosimilar drugs. Therefore, despite their similarities to the reference molecules, biosimilars are too different to forego clinical trials. Clinical trials of biosimilars need to be much broader than for generics, but they are limited compared to the reference biologicals’ testing. Placebo controlled clinical trials are not required before registering a new biosimilar. Immunogenicity is a major source of concern related to biosimilars, although there may be the same problem with the original drugs...|$|R
40|$|In an {{interdisciplinary}} approach, the Brazilian-German joint program WAVES (WATER AVAILABILITY AND VULNERABILITY OF ECOSYSTEMS AND SOCIETY IN SEMIARID REGIONS OF NORTHEAST BRAZIL) aims at analyzing {{the interactions between}} water availability, natural resources and human activities, to predict the impact of climate change on natural and social systems. Therefore, the SEMI-ARID INTEGRATED MODEL (SIM) and the MODEL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF LAND USE (MoSDEL) were developed for evaluating strategies on state and regional level of a sustained development in Northeast Brazil. A {{majority of the population}} in the rural areas depends directly or indirectly on agriculture production. There, crop production is often adversely affected by droughts and low soil fertility levels. The ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY INTEGRATED CLIMATE MODEL (EPIC) and it’s <b>follow-up</b> <b>version</b> AGRICULTURAL LAND MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVES WITH NUMERICAL ASSESSMENT CRITERIA (ALMANAC) were selected for generating the crop input data of the agricultural sector sub-model of integrated models SIM and MoSDEL.

The GPM core spacecraft, part of a constellation, will be required to maintain a circular orbit in a high drag environment at a near-critical inclination. Analysis shows that a mean orbit altitude of 407 km is necessary to prevent ground track repeating. Combined with goals to minimize maneuver operation impacts to science data collection and to enable reasonable long-term orbit predictions, the GPM project has decided to fly the GSFC autonomous maneuver system, AutoCon(TM).
