40|$|A spectroscopic {{ellipsometer}} was {{integrated in}} a vertical furnace for {{measurement and control}} during chemical vapor deposition and thermal oxidation processes. The major goal of this activity was to adapt the ellipsometer arrangement to the <b>furnace</b> <b>geometry</b> with a minimum impact on the furnace process performance. Modifications in the <b>furnace</b> <b>geometry</b> were restricted as far as possible, {{to show that a}} fast integration in existing industrial equipment with minor costs can be done. This aim led to a novel beam-guiding system. This setup has been used for the in situ characterization of polysilicon formation, inside the vertical furnace during high temperature processes. The polysilicon-on-oxide structures were modeled using the Bruggeman effective-medium approximation (B-EMA). The crystallization process of amorphous silicon layers during annealing at 600 °C has been monitored. Layer thickness and the degree of crystallinity can be obtained simultaneously.

This thesis consists of four parts. First, development and use of a mathematical model to predict the burden distribution which has a great effect on gas distribution and furnace efficiency. Second, simulate the blast furnace shaft process considering chemical reactions, heat exchanges, and gas-solid flow dynamics. Third, validate the burden distribution model and shaft simulation model using plant measurement. Fourth, to conduct parametric study of the major operational parameters i. e. effect of PCI rate, natural gas injection, bosh gas temperature, moisture add, oxygen enrichment, chimney size, and <b>furnace</b> <b>geometry.</b> Simulation is conducted using plant data and a good agreement is observed comparing with plant measurement. The parametric study showed {{that it is possible to}} improve the furnace performance by oxygen enrichment, adding moisture. It is also possible to decrease the coke rate by charging more PCI and increasing natural gas injection. Chimney size and <b>furnace</b> <b>geometry</b> can also affect a lot on the gas distribution and pressure drop.

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented that establishes how correction-free radiance measurements or pyrometry {{can be performed}} on targets in furnaces where there may be significant additional radiance from heated furnace walls or from reflecting surfaces close to the target. These configurations are common in microgravity and containerless processing applications where a specular target is radiantly heated in a hot-wall furnace, or inductively heated from the fields arising from nearby closely spaced electromagnetic coils. Proper design requires that the pyrometer does not view any images of the background features in the specular target so that stray radiation will not be reflected into the viewing optics of the pyrometer. To analyze the problem, conventional paraxial optics {{analysis is}} shown to be significantly in error. Instead a method of nonparaxial ray tracing, based on the derivatives of the ray paths, shows how the images must be located. This leads to analytical results {{that can be used}} to design such systems.

40|$|In a {{very recent}} study [1] the Renormalisation Group (RNG) {{turbulence}} model {{was used to}} obtain flow predictions in a strongly swirling quarl burner, and was found to perform well in predicting certain features that are not well captured using less sophisticated models of turbulence. The implication is that the RNG approach should provide an economical and reliable tool for the prediction of swirling flows in combustor and <b>furnace</b> <b>geometries</b> commonly encountered in technological applications. To test this hypothesis the present work considers flow in a model furnace for which experimental data is available [2]. The essential features of the flow which differentiate it from the previous study [1] are that the annular air jet entry is relatively narrow and the base wall of the cylindrical furnace is at 90 degrees to the inlet pipe. For swirl numbers of order 1 the resulting flow is highly complex with significant inner and outer recirculation regions. The RNG and standard k-epsilon models are used to model the flow for both swirling and non-swirling entry jets and the results compared with experimental data [2]. Near wall viscous effects are accounted for in both models via the standard wall function formulation [3]. For the RNG model, additional computations with grid placement extending well inside the near wall viscous-affected sublayer are performed {{in order to assess}} the low Reynolds number capabilities of the model...|$|R

It was found that the stability of MILD combustion under the counterflow conditions is highly sensitive to the momentum ratio of fuel to air ejecting into the furnace and that the present <b>furnace</b> <b>geometry</b> does not lend itself to this flow configuration. For most of the counterflow conditions studied, the exhaust gasses contained unburned hydrocarbons as well as high levels of CO and H 2, implying that fuel short circuiting was occurring inside the furnace. In contrast, the co-flow firing configurations, especially with premixing of the reactants, have proven to work extremely well.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} a modeling and control approach for the thermal {{aspects of a}} high-temperature semiconductor crystal growth process. From a thermal perspective, each crystal growth cycle is composed of three distinct phases, heat up, growth, and cool down, each with specific control challenges and objectives. This paper focuses on the heat up and growth phases in this paper. A simulation model is first developed based on the induction <b>furnace</b> <b>geometry</b> and known material properties. This model is calibrated using the experimental process data by minimizing the error between the predicted and actual temperature measurements. The two critical temperatures for the process are {{the temperature of the}} source material and the temperature of the crystal seed. For the heat up phase, the input profile is generated to rapidly ramp up the source and crystal temperature while avoiding damaging temperature spikes. In the crystal growth phase, the objective is to maintain the source temperature above sublimation while keeping the crystal temperature sufficiently low to allow condensation. These temperatures cannot be directly measured. Instead, two pyrometer measurements are used to identify a linear model and design an observer-based controller to achieve the temperature control objective. Simulation results with FEM-in-the-loop validation are presented. I...|$|E

The <b>furnace</b> <b>geometry,</b> with a sidewall-mounted burner, {{was similar to}} configurations commonly encountered in a steel reheat furnace. The effect of stack oxygen concentration, oxygen enrichment level and air infiltration on fuel savings/CO 2 reduction, NOx emissions and scale formation were investigated. The firing rate required to maintain the furnace temperature at 1100 C decreased linearly with increasing oxygen enrichment. At full oxygen enrichment a reduction of 40 - 45 % in the firing rate was required to maintain furnace temperature. NOx emissions were relatively constant at oxygen enrichment levels below 60 % and decreased concentration at all oxygen enrichment levels. Air infiltration also {{had an effect on}} NOx levels leading to emissions similar to those observed with no air infiltration but with similar stack oxygen concentrations. At high oxygen enrichment levels, there was a larger variation in the refractory surface-temperature on the roof and blind sidewall of the furnace. Scale habit, intactness, adhesion and oxidation rates were examined for five grades of steel over a range of stack oxygen concentrations and oxygen enrichment levels at 1100 degree C. The steel grade had the largest effect on scaling properties examined in this work.

40|$|Operating {{conditions}} of the furnaces has the major effect {{on the quality of}} steel during steel production process. Furnaces also are the biggest energy consumer in the whole production process  which make them a center of concern, {{in order to get to}} the most optimized condition through both energy and quality aspects. Soaking pit furnaces are for heating steel ingots before rolling, in order to provide convenient conditions for ingots for further procedures. These batch furnaces are characterized by heat and temperature conditions that vary in time. The structure permits rapid heating of the metal inside the furnace, since heat is supplied over the entire surface of the ingot. One serious problem that these furnaces might contain is the existence of non-uniform temperature gradient inside the chamber that causes different temperature distribution on the ingots surface which leads to a bad surface quality of them, considering further rolling process. As the first step through obtaining the best temperature gradient inside the chamber, is to ensure the exact temperature condition in the current running procedure. In here as the first step through the problem solving of these furnaces, temperature profile, radiation profile and other effective parameters are investigated with the aid of CFD software.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a numerical simulation method for the calculation of an unsteady, three-dimensional flow and combustion phenomena in a packed bed of a furnace. The entire arrangement of a furnace partly filled with solid particles is separated into a gas phase and a solid phase. The gas flow within the void space between particles is approximated by flow through porous media according to Darcy's law. The outer flow region of the combustion chamber will be modelled as a laminar/turbulent viscous flow. Therefore a set of equations, i. e. continuity, momentum and energy equation including the homogeneous combustion between a gaseous fuel and air are applied to describe accurately the behaviour of the phenomena encountered. The motion of the solid phase, as a flow of one particle past another, is accounted for by particle-to-particle friction. As heating up and combustion of particles significantly changes their size, temeprature and composition this behaviour is treated by a special particle modelling step. It takes into account a size reduction due to heterogeneous combustion, non-uniform temperature distribution due to internal heat generation and both convective and radiative heat transfer within the gas phase and the solid phase, and a varying composition due to pyrolysation and gasification. Similar to the gas phase, a set of conservation equations applied to particles yields the solution for the relevant variables. The sets of equations for both the solid and the gas phases will be solved by a time-marching finite volume approach on an unstructured computational mesh with arbitrarily shaped cells. This novelty enhances body fitted meshing and resolution of high gradient domains. An efficient non-iterative solution algorithm is employed, which allows the size of the computational time step to be controlled solely by accuracy, rather than numerical stability, considerations in the interest of economy. The method is assessed by application to two different <b>furnace</b> <b>geometries,</b> for which a wide range of experimental data, e. g. temperature, flow rates, and species measurements are available. (orig.) Innerhalb des vorliegenden Berichts wird eine numerische Simulationsmethode vorgestellt, um die instationaere, dreidimensionale Stroemung und Verbrennung von Partikeln in einem Festbett eines Ofens zu berechnen. Die Anordnung besteht aus einem Verbrennungsraum, der teilweise mit Feststoffpartikeln gefuellt ist. Die Stroemung in den Freiraeumen zwischen den Partikeln wird als Stroemung durch ein poroeses Medium beschrieben, auf die das Gesetz von Darcy angewendet werden kann. Der verbleibende gasfoermige Verbrennungsraum wird als laminare/turbulente, reibungsbehaftete Stroemung simuliert und kann durch die Kontinuitaets-, Impuls- und Energiegleichung einschliesslich homogener Verbrennung zwischen einem gasfoermigen Brennstoff und Luft beschrieben werden. Die Bewegung der Feststoffpartikel resultiert aus einer Bilanz zwischen Reibungskraeften an den Beruehrungspunkten der Partikel und von aussen einwirkenden Kraeften. Da waehrend der Aufheizphase und hauptsaechlich waehrend der Verbrennung Partikel sich ihre Groesse, Temperatur und Zusammensetzung aendern, wurde ein effizientes Verfahren zur Beschreibung dieser Parameter entwickelt. Damit wird der Masseverlust durch Verbrennung, ungleichmaessige Temperaturverteilung als Folge von Waermefreisetzung und Waermetransport hervorgerufen durch Konvektion und Waermestrahlung als auch die sich aendernde Zusammensetzung mit fortschreitender Pyrolyse und Vergasung erfasst. Analog zur Gasphase werden auch hier Kontinuitaets-, Impuls- und Energiegleichung zur Loesung der relevanten Variablen benutzt.

Department of Energy (DOE) /Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center (PETC) and the Public Services Company of Colorado (PSCo) {{signed the}} {{cooperative}} agreement for the Integrated Dry NO{sub x}/SO{sub 2 } Emissions Control System in March 1991. This project integrates various combinations of five existing and emerging technologies onto a 100 MWe, down-fired, load-following unit that burns pulverized coal. The project {{is expected to}} achieve up to 70 % reductions in both oxides of nitrogen (NO{sub x}) and sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2 }) emissions. Various combinations of low-NO{sub x} burners (LNBs), overfire air (OFA) ports, selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), dry sorbent injection (DSI) using both calcium- and sodium-based reagents, and flue-gas humidification are expected to integrate synergistically and control both NO{sub x} and SO{sub 2 } emissions better than if each technology were used alone. For instance, ammonia emissions from the SNCR system are expected to reduce NO{sub 2 } emissions and allow the DSI system (sodium-based reagents) to achieve higher removals of SO{sub 2 }. Unlike tangentially or wall-fired units, down-fired require substantial modification to their pressure parts to retrofit LNBs and OFA ports, substantially increasing the cost of retrofit.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} work {{was to develop a}} transferable mathematically simple model which gives the possibility to make fast and easy predictions regarding the NOx emission behavior of a broad–spectrum of coals within a certain combustion environment. In this context, this thesis is a further step of a common ongoing investigation focused on predicting NOx emissions from self–sustaining, pulverized coal combustion in dry bottom firing systems. A comprehensive literature research focused on already published NOx prediction approaches from scientific publications based on fundamental quantitative relationships or empirical algorithms and statistical relationships was also carried out in this context. This research concentrated on three specific areas which were found to constitute a major gap in the knowledge of NOx formation in industrial full–scale applications: the fuel properties; the dependence of <b>furnace</b> <b>geometry</b> factors; and the specific operating conditions. The developed model shows a strong statistical significance with a coefficient of determination of 0. 9876 and a standard error of 28 mg / m³ STPdry at 6 % O 2 based on 142 observations coming from 28 utility boilers. Direct comparisons between model history and observations reported by other researchers have also shown very good conformities. For that background, this thesis form a good basis for identifying individual factors which contributes to system related NOx emissions in order to investigate how variations in the process parameters affect the emission level.

40|$|For {{the first}} time, a spectroscopic {{ellipsometer}} (SE) has been {{integrated into a}} vertical furnace {{to use it as}} an in situ layer thickness sensor. An SE was selected because of its high accuracy and versatility. In the vertical furnace, the SE can be used for in situ sensing of the layer growth as well as for post process control of the batch. The adaptation of the SE to the furnace was performed with minor modifications of the <b>furnace</b> <b>geometry.</b> The light beam of the SE is guided through the base plate into the furnace tube and directed onto the wafer by quartz glass prisms operating in total internal reflection mode. This arrangement introduces an additional phase shift in the polarization state of the light which can be determined and subtracted from the measured phase shift. For in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry at high-temperature process steps the exact knowledge of the spectral refractice indices of the measured substrate and layer materials is of crucial importance. As there is still a lack of optical data as a function of temperature reported in the literature, these optical data of some relevant materials have been determined at high temperatures to make in situ measurement possible. The determination of this refractive indices was done with the in situ SE in the vertical furnace that ensures accurate temperature control and temperature homogeneity on the wafer up to 9000 C. With the knowledge of this refractive indices the SE can be used for in situ end point detection during layer growth. As the arrangement of the in situ SE enables also post process measurements on selected wafers of the batch during the unloading sequence, in situ and post process data can be used by an integrated novel furnace control system for immediate and automated correction of the parameter settings. The advantage of this integrated in situ SE such as time reduction for process optimization, avoidance of monitor wafers, and a better control of integrated multilayer processing can be beneficial for future thermal processing...|$|E
40|$|Blast <b>furnace</b> (BF) <b>geometry</b> is of {{significant}} importance to BF process {{because it can}} affect in-furnace multiphase flows, BF stability and efficiency. In the past several decades, the BFs have been frequently enlarged during their relining or rebuilding. However, thus far, the effects of BF geometrical parameters are largely known empirically and the underlying reasons for the enlargement of BF are still not obvious. This thesis presents a numerical study of BF geometrical parameters {{by means of the}} BF process model. This model is based on the one recently developed by Dong et al. [1]. The previous model has been improved in terms of the following two aspects: (i), the raw material, operational and geometrical conditions are allowed to vary in a flexible range rather than fixed; and (ii), the variation of the stock line with BF inner state as encountered in practice is considered by controlling burden charge rate according to the global coke balance inside the considered BF. Firstly, the applicability of the improved model has been examined by comparing the predicted BF performances with those practically observed for BFs operated with different coke ratios and blast rates. The model was then used to study the effects of BF geometrical parameters on BF performances and inner states. The calculated results reveal that the enlargement of BF inner volume by mean of expanding any of the BF dimensions improves BF efficiency in terms of the achievable coke ratio. The expansion of BF lateral dimensions lowers the in-furnace pressure drop while the elongation of BF height tends to increase the packed bed resistance to gas flow against the BF operational stability and larger productivity. Certain ratios of the horizontal dimensions are desirable to maintain a well-controlled gas throughflow and smooth descent of burden materials. Therefore, the adjustments of the BF inner liners corresponding to the enlargement of BF inner volume have been proven to be reasonable and necessary...|$|R

In particular this study is motivated {{by the need to}} better understand molten glass circulation in glass melting <b>furnaces.</b> The <b>geometry</b> of <b>furnaces</b> is rather simple : the free surface of the molten glass is horizontal and the refractory walls are parallelepipedic. However, the flow patterns in this geometry are actually 3 D as the width of the tank can be restricted at the neck while the height is modified by a step. For these reasons, the solution in the plane of symmetry can no longer be regarded as representative. For this class of problems, the convective currents are moderate amplitude, with a typical value of Reynolds number of O(1), while the Peclet number can be of order of 300 (given the low conductivity of molten glass). The numerical difficulty is therefore associated with solving of energy equation rather then that of momentum. While a detailed, steady-state solution is important, the time evolution of the flow structure is also of great interest. Given the intensity of the thermoconvection - the Grasshof number is approximate to 5000 - no unstationary solution should be expected. However, a sensitivity, study is a variation of the solution under varying operating conditions, e. g. pull rate; thermal boundary conditions [...] ., sheds light on the stability and the relative importance of both thermal and viscous effects. The numerical tool developed to simulate this physical situation is an unstationnary spectral element Boussinesq solver. Spatial discretization is realized through the division of the Computational domain in a limited (< 50) number of spectral elements. On each element, the unknowns are interpolated by a high-order Legendre polynomial. Depending on the value of the Prandtl number of the fluid, a greater number of degrees of freedom can be associated to the thermal problem. The goal of this presentation is to claim the efficiency of high order methods for the numerical simulation of thermoconvection in the glass melting tank. Comparisons with finite-difference and finite-element solutions demonstrates a lower number of degrees of freedom necessary to obtain specified level of accuracy. A global increase in computing efficiency allows 30 simulations like time evolution of melting rank during change of glass...|$|R
40|$|Problems {{associated}} with boilers {{are a major}} contributor to load losses in coal-fired power plants. The boiler furnace exit temperature is a key indicator of the combustion and heat transfer processes taking place and has a profound impact on the operation of the heat exchangers downstream of the furnace. Having a model that can predict the furnace exit temperature and heat flux distributions may enable furnace performance to be predicted without having to conduct extensive experimentation. Also, comparing the results with measurements taken on the plant may enable the identification of operating problems and potential sources of losses. Thermal radiation is the dominant mode of heat transfer in the boiler furnace. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} develop and implement a radiation heat transfer network solution methodology based on the zonal method that may be applied to boiler furnace modelling. The zonal method allows for the prediction of heat flux and temperature distributions on the walls, inside, and at the exit of the furnace. Direct exchange areas are the basis of the zonal method and are a function of the <b>furnace</b> <b>geometry</b> and radiative properties of the walls and the participating medium that fills the furnace volume. The evaluation of direct exchange areas is done by discrete numerical integration, after which it needs to be smoothed to satisfy energy conservation. After evaluating two different smoothing techniques, the least squares technique using Lagrange multipliers was selected for this study. Following this, the solution of the radiation heat transfer network was implemented for an emitting-absorbing-scattering participating medium for two different scenarios, namely (i) solving surface and volume heat fluxes for known surface and medium temperatures, and (ii) solving surface heat fluxes and medium temperature distributions for known surface temperatures and volume heat source terms. Intermediate verification and validation steps throughout the development process show good agreement with other numerical techniques and correlations available in literature. In order to illustrate the applicability of the final model, a number of case studies are conducted. These include an illustration of the effect of slagging on the furnace walls, of a faulty burner and of changes in the radiative properties of the participating medium. The results of the case studies show that the trends of the heat flux and temperature distributions obtained with the new model are in agreement with those found in literature...|$|E
40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} modeling was completed on the coal combustion {{to be implemented}} at Jimah Coal Fired Power Plant. The model {{was created in the}} Design Modeler and exported to computational {{fluid dynamics}} software called FLUENT. Non-premixed combustion model was chosen for coal combustion in order to better understand about the combustion and emissions from the process. Coal is used as a fuel in the combustion. The fuels were modeled with an empirical formula for coal from proximate and ultimate analyses. In FLUENT solver, coal contains species such as carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. The oxidant use of the combustion process consists of 79 % of oxygen and 21 % of nitrogen. The measurement of mercury emissions in stack gas has an average value of 8. 5 pg/Nm 3. The mercury removal efficiency of the plant is 99. 32 % that shows the reduction of the mercury emissions due to the co-benefit of the electrostatic precipitator and flue gas desulfiirization. The measured value of mercury concentration at the outlet of the furnace is 1250 pg/Nm 3. The model was tested to predict the temperature and species distribution from the coal combustion. The model is a 2 -D <b>furnace</b> <b>geometry</b> with a width of 15. 3 m and height of 48. 5 m. The model has 5731 nodes and 5554 elements. The standard k-e model was used for turbulence model. Besides that, mercury as a pollutant emission also had been predicted from the model as a post-processing from the combustion. From the simulation results, the distribution of the flue gases such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water and oxygen can be observed. The temperature of the furnace is higher in the combustion zone and decreased when flows upward towards the outlet of the furnace. The three models of mercury had been implemented in Fluent that consist of One Step Model, Two Step Model and Detailed Wilcox Model. Besides that, the distribution of mercury products such as Hg, HgCl and HgCh show its behavior in the furnace. When comparing with the measurement at the outlet of the furnace, the Detailed Wilcox Model has given more accurate value with 1270 pg/Nm 3, while One Step Model and Two Step Model give reasonably predicted values of 1000 pg/Nm 3 and 1100 pg/Nm 3 respectively...|$|E
40|$|Nonuniform {{temperature}} fields in steam cracking <b>furnaces</b> caused by <b>geometry</b> {{factors such as}} burner positions, shadow effects, and asymmetry of the reactor coil layout are detrimental for product yields and run lengths. The techniques of adjusting burner firing (zone firing) and feedstock mass flow rate (pass balancing) have been practiced industrially to mitigate these effects but could only reduce the nonuniformities between the so-called modules (a group of many coils). An extension of the pass balancing methodology is presented to further minimize the intra-module nonuniformities, that is, variation between the coils within a module, in floor fired furnaces. Coupled furnace-reactor computational fluid dynamics-based simulations of an industrial ultraselective conversion (USC) furnace were performed to evaluate four different feedstock flow distribution schemes, realizing equal values for coil outlet temperature, propene/ethene mass ratio, maximum coking rate and maximum tube metal temperature (TMT), respectively, over all the reactor coils. It is shown that feedstock flow distribution creates a larger operating window and extends the run length. Out of the four cases, the coking rate as criterion leads to the highest yearly production capacity for ethene and propene. Uniform maximum coking rates boost the annual production capacity of the USC furnace with a nameplate ethene capacity of 130 103 metric tons per year with 1000 metric tons for ethene and 730 metric tons for propene. For industrial application, achieving uniform maximum TMT is more practical due to its measurability by advanced laser-based techniques. Most steam cracking furnaces can be retrofitted by optimizing the dimensions of venturi nozzles that regulate the feedstock flow to the coils.

40|$|Confined non-reacting {{turbulent}} jets {{are ideal}} for recirculating the hot flue gas back into the furnace from an external exhaust duct. Such jets are also used inside the furnace to internally entrain and recirculate the hot flue gas to preheat and dilute the reactants. Both internal and external implementation of confined turbulent jets increase the furnace thermal efficiency. For external implementation, depending on the circumstances, the exhaust gas flow may be co- or counter-flow relative to the jet flow. Inside the furnaces, fuel and air jets are injected separately. To create a condition which can facilitate near homogeneous combustion, these jets have to first mix with the burned gas inside the furnace and simultaneously being heated and diluted prior to combustion. Clearly, the combustion pattern and emissions from reacting confined turbulent jets are affected by jet interactions, mixing and entrainment of hot flue gas. In this work, the flow and mixing characteristics of a non-reacting and reacting confined turbulent jet are investigated experimentally and numerically. This work consists of two parts: (i) 	A study of flow and mixing characteristics of non-reacting confined turbulent jets with co- or counter-flowing exhaust/flue gas. Here the axial and radial distributions of temperature, velocity and NO concentration (used as a tracer gas) were measured. FLUENT was used to numerically simulate the experimental results. This work provides the basic understanding of the flow and mixing characteristics of confined turbulent jets and develops some design considerations for recirculating flue gas back into the furnace as expressed by the recirculation zone and the stagnation locations. (ii) 	Numerical calculations of near homogeneous combustion are performed for the existing <b>furnace.</b> The exact <b>geometry</b> of the <b>furnace</b> in the lab is used and the real dimensional boundary conditions are considered. The parameters such as air nozzle diameter (dair), fuel nozzle diameter (df), equivalence ratio (Φ), oxygen concentration, gravity, different bottom temperature and separation distance as well as soot radiation that influence the establishment of homogeneous combustion to improve combustion efficiency and reduce pollutant emissions will be numerically studied...|$|R
40|$|Fluctuations of the {{electrical}} resistivity due to inhomogeneous dopant distribution {{are still a}} serious problem for the industrial processing yield of doped silicon crystals. In the case of silicon floating-zone growth, the main sources of these inhomogeneities are time- dependent flows in the liquid phase during the growth process. Excluding radio frequency (RF) induced convection, buoyancy and thermocapillary (Marangoni) convection are the two natural reasons for fluid flow. Both originate from temperature/concentration gradients in the melt, buoyancy convection through thermal/concentrational volume expansion, and thermocapillary convection through the temperature/concentration dependence of the surface tension. To improve the properties of grown crystals, knowledge of the strength, the characteristic, and the relation of these two flow mechanisms is essential. By the use of microgravity, the effect {{and the strength of}} buoyancy (gravity dependent) and thermocapillary (gravity independent) convection can be separated and clarified. Applying magnetic fields, both convective modes can be influenced: fluid flow can either be damped (static magnetic fields) or overlaid by a regular flow regime (rotating magnetic fields). Two complementary approaches have been pursued: Silicon full zones (experiments on the German sounding rockets TEXUS 7, 12, 22, 29, and 36) with the maximum temperature at half of the zone height and silicon half zones (experiments on the Japanese sounding rockets TR-IA 4 and 6) with the maximum temperature {{at the top of the}} melt. With the full zone arrangement, the intensity and the frequency of the dopant striations could be determined and the critical Marangoni number could be identified. The half zone configuration is suited to classify the flow pattern and to measure the amplitude and the frequency of temperature fluctuations in the melt by inserting thermocouples or temperature sensors into the melt. All experiments have been carried out in monoellipsoid mirror <b>furnaces.</b> Typical zone <b>geometries</b> are approx. 8 to 14 mm in diameter and height. The crystals grown under microgravity are compared to crystals grown in static axial magnetic fields (B< 5 tesla) and in transversal rotating magnetic fields (B< 7. 5 mT / f= 50 Hz). Experimental results are completed by 3 D numerical simulations: the obtained temperature and concentration distribution in the melt confirm the damping effect of rotating magnetic fields and explain the change in the radial segregation under static magnetic fields...|$|R
