50|$|Information Culture is {{the part}} of {{organizational}} culture where evaluation and attitudes towards information depend on the situation in which the organization works. In an organization everyone has different attitudes, but the <b>information</b> <b>profile</b> must be explained, so the importance of information should be realized by executives. The Information Culture is also about formal information systems (technology), common knowledge, individual information systems (attitudes), and information ethics. Information Culture does not include written or conscious behavior and what seemingly happening in the organization. Information Culture is affected by the behaviors of internal factors of organization more than external factors, which comes in form of Information Culture, the attitudes and the traditions. Information Culture deals with information, information channels, the attitudes, the use and ability to forward or gather information with the environmental circumstances effectively. Knowledge base of any organization can be viewed according to Nonaka’s theories about the organizational knowledge production and Cronin & Davenport's theories about the social intelligence. According to these theories it is important to look at the organization Information Culture how the user uses the information.Cultural differences need to be understood before information technology developed for an organization in one country can be effectivelyimplemented in an organization in another country.|$|E

5000|$|Vanden Brook {{became part}} of an {{apparent}} disinformation campaign that aimed to besmirch his professional reputation linked to his reporting on the Pentagon's information operations programs. [...] According to a story by Gregory Korte in USA Today, Vanden Brook and Ray Locker were the targets of an [...] "information operations" [...] campaign in which web sites based on their names were registered and Facebook and Twitter accounts were created using their names without their permission. In addition, a Wikipedia entry allegedly was created {{as part of the}} campaign to create and manipulate an <b>information</b> <b>profile</b> on the Internet. These actions occurred simultaneously with their reporting on the vast cost-overruns at the Pentagon's [...] "information operations" [...] programs in Afghanistan and Iraq. If the activities were by the Pentagon or its contractors and used federal funds, the perpetrators would have violated federal law prohibiting the creation of propaganda targeting a domestic audience. The Pentagon denied having any knowledge of the activities and said that its information operations contractors also denied targeting Vanden Brook and Locker. In May 2012, Camille Chidiac, minority owner and former president of the Pentagon's top propaganda contractor Leonie Industries, accepted personal responsibility for the operation. Leonie Industries insisted that any public roles played recently by Chidiac on behalf of the company were purely informal. The Department of Defense distanced itself explicitly from the smear campaign. In October 2012, four months after the Pentagon renewed its contract with Leonie Industries, its Investigator General announced a criminal investigation into the company due to the incident.|$|E

40|$|A fluid analog of the {{information}} flux in the phase-space associated to purity and von Neumann entropy are identified in the Weyl-Wigner formalism of quantum mechanics. Once constrained by symmetry and positiveness, the encountered continuity equations provide novel quantifiers for non-classicality (non-Liouvillian fluidity) given in terms of quantum decoherence, purity and von Neumann entropy fluxes. Through definitions in the Weyl-Wigner formalism, one can identify the quantum fluctuations that distort the classical-quantum coincidence regime, and the corresponding quantum <b>information</b> <b>profile,</b> whenever some bounded $x-p$ volume of the phase-space is specified. The dynamics of anharmonic systems is investigated in order to illustrate such a novel paradigm for describing quantumness and classicality through the flux of quantum information in the phase-space.

Methods. Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) from 4 hospitals in the UK completed the SCIP before treatment and again 1 month after treatment. Psychometric properties of the measure were evaluated: internal consistency, subscale inter-correlations, discriminant validity, concurrent validity, and pre-dictive validity. The responsiveness of the measure to change and ease of completion was also assessed. Results.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{investigate how}} the Average Mutual <b>Information</b> <b>profile</b> {{could be used}} to provide a useful distance measure between two DNA Sequences. This distance measure has the advantage over other measures by being only minimally affected by errors in the genomic sequence data. The distance measure used here is shown to be an effective method for classification of sequences into groups or the identification of an unknown sequence as to belonging to a particular group. This is demonstrated using several examples of chromosomes from different species as well as chromosomes from the same species. The distance measure is then used to generate two dimensional and three dimensional mappings to visualize relationships between sequences. The distance measure is also used to generate UPGMA trees showing possible genetic relations between groups of sequences. ...|$|E

40|$|Data {{summarization}} and triage {{is one of}} {{the current}} top challenges in visual analytics. The goal is to let users visually inspect large data sets and examine or request data with particular characteristics. The need for summarization and visual analytics is also felt when dealing with digital representations of DNA sequences. Genomic data sets are growing rapidly, making their analysis increasingly more difficult, and raising the need for new, scalable tools. For example, being able to look at very large DNA sequences while immediately identifying potentially interesting regions would provide the biologist with a flexible exploratory and analytical tool. In this paper we present a new concept, the "information profile", which provides a quantitative measure of the local complexity of a DNA sequence, independently of the direction of processing. The computation of the <b>information</b> <b>profiles</b> is computationally tractable: we show that it can be done in time proportional to the length of the sequence. We also describe a tool to compute the <b>information</b> <b>profiles</b> of a given DNA sequence, and use the genome of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe strain 972 h(-) and five human chromosomes 22 for illustration. We show that <b>information</b> <b>profiles</b> are useful for detecting large-scale genomic regularities by visual inspection. Several discovery strategies are possible, including the standalone analysis of single sequences, the comparative analysis of sequences from individuals from the same species, and the comparative analysis of sequences from different organisms. The comparison scale can be varied, allowing the users to zoom-in on specific details, or obtain a broad overview of a long segment.

Some previous consumer health information systems are capable of providing relevant information {{in the light of}} patients’ medical records or history; information prioritization, however, is absent. We have developed a comprehensive Diabetes <b>Information</b> <b>Profile</b> (DIP) and a set of algorithms to score the priority of information for diabetic patients; we call the implementation of our approach “Violet Technology ” (VT). An adaptive web portal using VT has been developed. The purpose of the portal is to promote doctor-patient partnership by providing diabetic patients with dynamically prioritized information (the right information at the right time) and a personalized agenda for the patients to bring to a health encounter. The web portal has three adaptive services: Information Service, Quizzing Service and Agenda Service. This paper introduces the VT, web portal architecture and its services...|$|E
40|$|Auclair and Siéroff (2002) {{examined}} lateralized cuing {{effects in}} the identification of centrally presented letter strings and reported no cuing effects for short word stimuli. They argued for a redistribution of attention over the entire word for short familiar words. We explored cuing effects with Chinese phonetic compounds, which can be considered extreme examples of short words, in a character-level semantic judgment task. When the semantic radical position was placed on the left of the characters, strong radical combinability and semantic transparency effects were observed. There was also a significant interaction between cue position (left vs. right) and radical combinability: A left cue facilitated semantic judgment of characters with small radical combinability more than did a right cue. This behavior reflects the <b>information</b> <b>profile</b> of Chinese phonetic compounds. Semantic radicals with small combinability are more informative than those with large combinability in determining the meaning of the whole character, they therefore benefit more from a left than a right cue. A mechanism redistributing attention over the whole of the character was not in evidence at the level of semantic processing.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{information}} content of signals about {{the identity of}} investors and their role in price formation. Whereas we document that investors use multiple brokers, broker identity is nevertheless a powerful signal about the identity of investors who initiate trades. The market also correctly processes this signal: the permanent price impact of orders coming from different brokers fits the <b>information</b> <b>profile</b> of the investors associated with these brokers. Our results suggest that {{an increase in the}} degree of anonymity may render order flow less informative, which could explain why the literature has documented liquidity improvements in exchanges that reduce transparency. (JEL G 12, G 14, G 28) The concept of anonymity in financial markets pertains to the information that market observers have about the identity of investors who submit orders. On the most basic level, anonymity relates to how informed investors exploit their informational advantage, and therefore the extent of anonymity affects adverse selection and the informational efficiency of prices.

40|$|Objective: Preparing {{patients}} for medical interventions improves patient outcomes {{and is an}} ethical and legal imperative. This review examines the characteristics and psychometric properties of published instruments which assess patients' preparation for medical interventions. Methods: Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched from the date of their inception to November 2015. Data-based publications describing the development or validation of a self-report instrument designed to assess the quality of adult patients' perceived preparation for a medical intervention were included. Results: Nine publications described the development or validation of seven instruments which met inclusion criteria. The psychometric qualities of the instruments varied. None met all of the accepted criteria for psychometric rigour. Although the Satisfaction with Cancer <b>Information</b> <b>Profile</b> met the highest number (n = 5) of the defined psychometric properties, the study sample size was less than 100.
