40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Exogenous and <b>indigenous</b> <b>inclusions</b> {{are defined}} and {{described}} {{with respect to}} their origins and effects in cast steel. Means of minimizing exogenous inclusions thru prevention of their formation as well as entrapment in the mold filling system are discussed. <b>Indigenous</b> <b>inclusions</b> arise from elements normally present in steel, principally oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur, and to control these inclusions it is necessary to limit the concentration of the forming elements. Conventional steelmaking techniques for controlling the oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur levels are described. Absolute elimination of <b>indigenous</b> <b>inclusions</b> has not been attained, so it is necessary to treat the residual inclusions {{in such a way that}} their deleterious effects are minimized.

40|$|For {{more than}} 50 years, Catholic and evangelical missionaries, the State, {{international}} aid agencies and indigenous organizations have widely used radio stations as tools for promoting literacy, introducing new agricultural techniques, evangelization, {{and protection of}} indigenous languages within indigenous societies in Colombia. Yet, we do not really know {{the impact of these}} radio stations on the indigenous people’s political, social, and cultural life. 	This dissertation assesses the impact of community radio, focusing on two of the most politically involved indigenous communities of Colombia – the Misak and the Nasa people from the Cauca region. In addition to founding the Colombian indigenous movement, the Misaks and the Nasas have long been involved in community oriented media projects, including the Catholic Church’s Radio Sutatenza, community radio stations, and evangelical radio stations. My hypothesis is that these radio stations have been fundamental tools to promote <b>indigenous</b> <b>inclusion</b> into the modern Colombian society. This process of <b>indigenous</b> <b>inclusion,</b> however, has brought new challenges for indigenous people, including dependency on external funding, corruption, and bureaucratization of indigenous organizations. As a response, indigenous grassroots are currently proposing other communication practices and theories in order to resist the contradictions brought by this modernization process...|$|E

The {{discovery}} that the inclusions in weld deposits are not uniformly distributed is an important step towards being able to model the inclusion distribution in steel weld deposits. The precise mechanism, and the factors which influence this behaviour could be found using transparent organic media, seeded with inert powders to act as inclusions. In this way, the process of inclusion redistribution could be observed as it occurred, during solidification. Similarly, the effect of inclusion size distribution could also be investigated using low melting point alloys with carefully-characterised particle sizes. With a knowledge of the initial size distribution of the inclusions in the melt, and the dimensions of the primary columnar grains, the final distribution of these inclusions could be estimated. The quantity of secondary <b>indigenous</b> <b>inclusions</b> in the weld is also calculable.

40|$|In Australia, {{representation}} of Indigenous populations within the engineering profession is very low. Evidence suggests that {{understanding of the}} needs, values and priorities of Indigenous communities is low among engineers. It {{has been suggested that}} the continuing low levels of participation of Australian Indigenous people in the engineering profession may stem from negative interactions between Indigenous traditional owner groups and the engineering industry. There also continues to be a low level of awareness of the differences between knowledge systems in Indigenous and Western cultures. Progressing the <b>Indigenous</b> <b>inclusion</b> agenda within Australian Engineering Education requires a clearer understanding of the current status of efforts in this area, and in particular, the preparedness of engineering educators to manage increased numbers of students from this non-traditional cohort effectively. This paper reports on a proposed pathway to effective integration of Aboriginal perspectives (including knowledge and value systems) in engineering education. Interview research was conducted to explore engineering educators 2 ̆ 7 understandings of Australian Indigenous cultures, and their views on incorporating Indigenous perspectives. Ten engineering academics from around the country were interviewed on their experiences working with Indigenous people in professional, social and educational settings. The findings of this study point towards a historical disconnect between non-Indigenous and Indigenous Australians. Awareness of Indigenous cultures and history appears to be limited, although there is a level of good-will towards changing this. Of critical importance was the lack of long-term professional and/or personal relationships between the engineering educators in this study and Indigenous Australians. This presents challenges moving forward as fundamental understandings of culture, history and politics are limited. Connections between Indigenous communities and engineering schools and academics are basic at best, and at the individual level. The low {{representation of}} Indigenous people within engineering academia and Industry means that a concerted effort must be made to bridge the divide. It is clear that a long-term commitment to <b>Indigenous</b> <b>inclusion</b> within Engineering education is required, and an understanding that there is much to be learned and understood about Indigenous culture, history and politics and their relationship to the field of engineering...|$|E
40|$|Sustainability {{is built}} upon {{relationships}} {{as this is}} the only way to bring together government, market and community to create the innovative solutions required. Typically Indigenous people in Western Australia have not been included within relationship building. This is a result of a number of factors, most primarily the low representation and power of Indigenous people within mainstream participatory structures. Two case studies, Dialogue with the City and Dialogue with the Pilbara: Newman Tomorrow, which have attempted to include Indigenous people in participation are outlined and analysed. The concept of relational power provides the focus of analysis of the two case studies. Reflections upon Indigenous participation and relational power include issues relating to a process approach; representation; power, knowledge and control; and the need for more creative and culturally appropriate participatory tools and techniques. The paper concludes by emphasising the priority of relationship building to enable Indigenous participation, in addition to the imperative of <b>Indigenous</b> <b>inclusion</b> within participatory initiatives which highlight but do not necessarily resolve hidden tensions and power conflicts. Resolution of these tensions and conflicts remains within the political arena...|$|E
40|$|In {{this essay}} I examine how Indigenous artists and {{performers}} leveraged <b>Indigenous</b> <b>inclusion</b> in Vancouver’s 2010 Winter Olympic Games to refuse conditions that spectacularize Indigeneity for the consumptive appetite of settler-spectators. Their refusals, I suggest, called upon settler-spectators to reorient their placement on Indigenous land: {{to move from}} understanding themselves as citizens of a postcolonial nation-state celebrated through Olympic (inter) nationalism, to settlers (still) occupying unceded Indigenous territory. I critique how settler subjectivity and settler colonial relations have historically been produced through non-Indigenous people engaging with Indigenous people and political expression as spectators, enjoying the privilege and presumption of consuming and looking at Indigenous people and art. To be called into a different relation by Indigenous art and performance that refuses our spectatorship, we {{are called upon to}} relinquish our position as spectators, to identify ourselves as settlers, and to reorient ourselves temporally, spatially, and politically to Indigenous peoples and land. The positioning of Indigenous art and performance as refusals within and against the Olympics, the ultimate spectacle of statehood and inclusion, intensified their potency. Refusing and revising the spectacle, they playfully and powerfully unsettled settler-spectators and settler colonial conditions. ...|$|E

This chapter reviews the history of indigenous exclusion and removal from national parks regarded as 'wilderness areas', starting with Yellowstone. and the relationship to tourism.

There is a focus in this chapter on governance structures allowing for <b>indigenous</b> <b>inclusion</b> in park management, cultural interpretation, cultural values and conflicts in parks and the involvement of indigenous groups in tourism and conservation within these co-managed national parks. Regaining legal control over tribal lands within parks and the reassertion of indigenous cultural identity in protected areas will increasingly define the management of conservation and tourism in these parks...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} significant rise of American Indian political power, rights claims, recognition endeavors and reaffirmation of Chumash identity through cultural revitalization projects in southern California.

Drawing on extensive ethnographic study among federally unrecognized Chumash groups who have been dramatically underrepresented in political, legal and social arenas, this research outlines the representational, material and organizational challenges they face in pressing for recognition, rights claims and balanced representation in policy. Ethnographic research methods of participant observation, interviews, and archival research were conducted in southern California where there is a large concentration of Chumash American Indian communities, academics, and government officials negotiating and contesting claims of indigenous rights and identity. Explored were how the inherent contradictions between indigenous, legal, academic and scientific knowledge in policy arenas are negotiated and reconciled; how collaborative efforts between government officials, indigenous groups and academics might better design and implement policies to serve the diversity of indigenous circumstances and; various ways indigenous knowledge, practices and discourse are utilized for greater recognition in political, social and policy arenas. By elucidating how the struggle for recognition shifts power relations among Chumash, academics, policy makers and government officials, this project opens an understanding to the effective collaborative practices, organizational strategies, and flexible policies working to balance multiple needs, voices and goals of unrecognized American Indians...|$|E
40|$|My thesis {{explores the}} historical, {{cultural}} and familial context of money as it flows through Indigenous households in remote, regional and urban Australia (&lsquo;Indigenous money&rsquo;), and considers how this influences Indigenous views on financial capability and well-being. Indigenous people are over-represented amongst three million financially excluded Australians, {{and those with}} lower financial capability, irrespective of where they live. Research finds gaps in <b>Indigenous</b> <b>inclusion</b> vis-&agrave;-vis mainstream Australia, yet offers limited explanation of why this persists. Indigenous cultural norms are identified {{as a barrier to}} enhancing inclusion, yet few studies focus on how Indigenous people understand and want to use money. National financial literacy targets the young through the formal education system, yet elders are the traditional custodians of Indigenous knowledge. Using a research paradigm privileging the Indigenous perspective, I examine the cultural shaping of money, based on Viviana Zelizer&rsquo;s theory of the social shaping of money. I find that &lsquo;Indigenous money&rsquo; is culturally distinctive from &lsquo;Anglo-Celtic&rsquo; understandings of money, which underlie Australian financial policy. This understanding influences their world-view of financial capability and well-being. Participants see money as imposed from &lsquo;outside&rsquo; their culture, yet have adapted it into their everyday lives in culturally distinctive ways. Elders describe the difficulty of having to learn and abide by the rules of &lsquo;two&rsquo; worlds including those that revolve around money. In remote locations money is seen as disconnected from traditional Indigenous knowledge and law. In regional and urban areas, money is inextricably linked to a wider, ongoing challenge to re-conceptualise Indigenous cultural identity and roles, vis-&agrave;-vis mainstream, non-Indigenous Australia. &lsquo;Indigenous money&rsquo; flows between related households, rather than being bounded within a nuclear family household. Participants say they prioritize sharing money over saving it, as compared to non-Indigenous people. Elders want to feel more in control of money - they {{want to know more about}} it, and connect with their cultural knowledge of managing valued resources, so that they can role model how younger generations should use money wisely. &lsquo;Indigenous money&rsquo; contributes to participants&rsquo; well-being when they are able to use it for caring, and facilitate not just individual but also family and community goals. Well-being is compromised by feelings of stress and guilt associated with financial choices which clash with cultural norms and identity. Historical, cultural and familial factors have influenced the understanding of &lsquo;Indigenous money&rsquo;, financial capability and well-being. Though context matters, the understanding of &lsquo;Indigenous money&rsquo; remains culturally distinctive vis-&agrave;-vis &rsquo;Anglo-Celtic money&rsquo;. Money is disconnected from participants&rsquo; socio-cultural world-view, including traditional knowledge, cultural values and norms, and their sense of cultural identity. This feeling of disconnect may be why Indigenous people are more likely to be excluded, irrespective of location. My thesis contributes to knowledge, theory and policy by exploring the participants&rsquo; world-view of money, how they manage and use it, as well as its role in their well-being. Policymakers can connect efforts to enhance Indigenous financial well-being with knowledge about the cultural shaping of &lsquo;Indigenous money&rsquo; to use culture as an enabler, rather than a barrier, to greater financial inclusion...|$|E

40|$|There {{could be}} no more {{appropriate}} time to revisit the issues of rice diversity {{and the politics of}} genetic resources in Thailand, as its farming and policy environments are transformed. In this transitional phase, much remains unknown about the direction of on-farm rice diversity and the outcome of rice genetic resource management policy, particularly with regard to equity and sustainability outcomes. In addressing these gaps in the literature, this dissertation presents three separate studies focusing on research themes: i) the dynamics of on-farm rice diversity, ii) the politics of scientific and indigenous knowledge, and iii) the management of rice genetic resources. This dissertation employs a multi-sited ethnographical approach that covers research sites in farm villages, government and private plant research and development centers, and a non-government organization. This approach provides the three studies a comparative examination of various trajectories of changes, practices of scientific or <b>indigenous</b> knowledge <b>inclusion,</b> and effects of regulatory and policy advisory frameworks, respectively. These three studies highlight the role of global discourses in shaping local practices and politics of genetic resource management. The interactions between global policy discourses, national policies and existing material structures and symbolic cultures at the local level lead to different trajectories in the dynamics of on-farm rice diversity and its management. The incorporation of scientific and indigenous knowledge {{can be viewed as a}} new political practice of knowledge formation and utilization. This new politics needs to be re-conceptualized as global politics of scientific and indigenous knowledge that is situated in local politics of genetic resources. Changes in plant genetic resource management policies have inadvertently diverted local practices away from sustainability and equity. Such divergence in local conservation and development practices is due to the re-situation of local institutional processes within new global and national political spaces, not just the result of institutional incompatibility or political resistance. The dissertation’s findings suggest a need for better integration of theoretical insights into policy interventions so as to take into account possible interactions between a) material and symbolic structures and b) local and extra-local processes that determine on-farm rice diversity and the politics of genetic resources...|$|R
40|$|Ever-growing {{requirements}} on combustion engine efficiency of motor vehicles demand increasing service loads in powertrain components. Optimization of component material is therefore inevitable. A major detriment with many forged transmission components is their anisotropic mechanical behavior, not least during cyclic loading. Any forging operation will introduce material flow and therewith orientation into the material. With the bulk material also non-metallic inclusions will be deformed. This {{orientation of the}} microstructure is held responsible for mechanical anisotropy. Manganese sulfides (MnS) in engineering steel are <b>indigenous</b> non-metallic <b>inclusions</b> which appear according to chemical specifications. These sulfides may generate benefits during component machining and are therefore widely accepted. Microstructural investigations on several materials showed that manganese sulfides deform excessively during any hot deformation operation of the steel. However, by solid solution hardening of the sulfides with calcium (Ca), original inclusion shapes can be maintained throughout a deformation operation. The present investigation {{is concerned with the}} examination of the influence of deformed MnS inclusions on fatigue anisotropy. Experimental as well as commercial medium carbon steels with standard and low sulfur (S) contents and therewith different sulfide populations have been hot deformed. Hardened test specimens of those steels, taken in short-transverse and longitudinal directions with respect to the deformation direction, were then fatigue tested. For material with standard S content, fatigue limits in longitudinal test direction are generally twice as high as in short transverse direction. Fractographic investigations showed that fatigue crack initiation is dominated by sulfide inclusions which ultimately can be held responsible for material anisotropy. The very poor fatigue resistance in short transverse direction {{can be attributed to the}} appearance of clustered sulfides, where the geometry of such clusters is not accessible by any established metallographic procedure. Diminishing of sulfide inclusions did improve isotropy. Yet, the most powerful measure to increase isotropy of the material proved to be an additional Ca treatment of the sulfides. Thus, quasi isotropic material could be created. In-situ tensile testing in a scanning electron microscope chamber showed that manganese sulfides bond very poorly to the steel matrix. Manganese sulfides in a steel matrix should therefore be seen as inherent micro-cracks. The nature of discoid sulfides being micro-cracks matters also during material hardening where current production material shows a considerably higher quench crack propensity as compared with low S material. Quench cracks initiate at flattened sulfides. Machinability of low S material did not show to be problematic at high cutting speeds. It is believed that an optimization of cutting parameters can balance the disadvantages of low S material during machining operations with low cutting speeds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cardiovascular {{diseases}} contribute substantially to {{the poor}} health and reduced life expectancy of Indigenous Australians. Heart failure is a common, disabling, progressive and costly complication of these disorders. The epidemiology of heart failure and the adequacy of relevant health service provision in Indigenous Australians are not well delineated. Methods A systematic search of the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cinahl Plus, Informit and Google Scholar was undertaken in April 2012 for peer-reviewed journal articles relevant {{to the topic of}} heart failure in Indigenous Australians. Additionally, a website search was done to identify other pertinent publications, particularly government reports. Results There was a paucity of relevant peer-reviewed research, and government reports dominated the results. Ten journal articles, 1 published conference abstract and 10 reports were eligible for <b>inclusion.</b> <b>Indigenous</b> Australians reportedly have higher morbidity and mortality from heart failure than their non-Indigenous counterparts (age-standardised prevalence ratio 1. 7; age-standardised hospital separation ratio ≥ 3; crude per capita hospital expenditure ratio 1. 58; age-adjusted mortality ratio > 2). Despite the evident disproportionate burden of heart failure in Indigenous Australians, the accuracy of estimation from administrative data is limited by poor indigenous identification, inadequate case ascertainment and exclusion of younger subjects from mortality statistics. A recent journal article specifically documented a high prevalence of heart failure in Central Australian Aboriginal adults (5. 3 %), noting frequent undiagnosed disease. One study examined barriers to health service provision for Indigenous Australians in the context of heart failure. Conclusions Despite the shortcomings of available published data, it is clear that Indigenous Australians have an excess burden of heart failure. Emerging data suggest that undiagnosed cases may be common in this population. In order to optimise management and to inform policy, high quality research on heart failure in Indigenous Australians is required to delineate accurate epidemiological indicators and to appraise health service provision. </p...|$|R

The aim is to explore the use of Indigenous knowledge in decolonising relationships of exclusion, and in facilitating social and ecological sustainability in settler societies. The basic premise is that Indigenous knowledge derived from place not only empowers minorities to confront the impacts of social exclusion, but contributes to ways of dealing with social injustice and ecological crisis in this time of rapid social and ecological change. [...] The thesis starts by inspecting the colonial histories of two settler societies in Australasia: Taiwan and Australia. Settlers' stereotypes of Indigenous people, and the different uses and values of land between settlers and Indigenous people, are respectively reviewed and analysed. In addition, I explore the concepts of national parks and nature conservation. The first national parks created in both countries functioned as another mode of colonisation. The idea of wilderness and policies of nature conservation, excluding Indigenous people and suppressing their livelihood and traditional culture, caused tense situations between national parks and Indigenous people. The development and changes in national parks are briefly overviewed. The first part provides the base upon which the fieldwork chapters are mounted. [...] There is a strong emphasis in the presentation of the fieldwork data on the value and significance of Indigenous knowledge. I work with three case studies of cultural survival relating to sacred mountains and national parks: Yushan National Park in Taiwan, and Gulaga and Gundabooka National Parks in NSW, Australia. The case studies provide the social and cultural context for investigating <b>Indigenous</b> knowledge, social <b>inclusion,</b> and environmental crisis. A major focus is the Elders' transmission of Indigenous knowledge and core values to Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Ideas of relational sustainability, involving complex and subtle networks between humans, non-humans, and natural environments, are implicated in systems of Indigenous knowledge. Relational sustainability is an important framework for organising and expressing key values. [...] In the last part, I examine the similarities and differences between Taiwan and Australia concerning impacts of colonisation of Indigenous people, land, and culture. In terms of cultural survival, I compare and contrast the formation and contents of Indigenous knowledge in relation to myths and laws. The Indigenous philosophy of the gift plays a crucial role in understanding the relevant values through which Indigenous people shape and practice relational sustainability. My analysis proposes that beyond gift economy, relational sustainability entails a gift ecology [...] [...] The research reveals that both for Indigenous people and national parks, cultural survival and ecological survival are interdependent and reciprocal to an extent that they may best be thought as one and the same thing. The key values discovered in this research, which have been practiced by Indigenous people for thousands years, indicate a sophisticated relational sustainability. A relational gift philosophy helps people to reconcile with each other and the land, thus facilitating social and ecological sustainability in contexts of decolonisation. Through the practice and communication of traditional knowledge by Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, social reconciliation and ecological sustainability may be improved. Finally, my research is intended to open dialogues and build bridges between Taiwan and Australia, East and West, Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples, colonisation and decolonisation, localisation and globalisation.
