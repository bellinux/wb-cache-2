5|$|A {{concern for}} sexual {{activity}} that is not dangerous but that can be upsetting for both partners is bladder or bowel leakage due to urinary or fecal incontinence. Couples can prepare for sex by draining the bladder using <b>intermittent</b> catheterization or placing towels down in advance. People with indwelling urinary catheters must take special care with them, removing them or taping {{them out of the}} way.|$|E
5|$|All cacti {{have some}} adaptations to promote {{efficient}} water use. Most cacti—opuntias and cactoids—specialize in surviving in hot and dry environments (i.e. they are xerophytes), {{but the first}} ancestors of modern cacti were already adapted to periods of <b>intermittent</b> drought. A small number of cactus species in the tribes Hylocereeae and Rhipsalideae have become adapted to life as climbers or epiphytes, often in tropical forests, where water conservation is less important.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the fossil}} sites that have yielded Velociraptor remains {{preserve}} an arid environment with fields of sand dunes and only <b>intermittent</b> streams, although the younger Barun Goyot environment {{seems to have}} been slightly wetter than the older Djadochta. The posture of some complete fossils, as well as the mode of preservation most show within structureless sandstone deposits, may show that a number of specimens were buried alive during sandstorm events common to the three environments.|$|E
5|$|Apomorphine, a non-orally {{administered}} dopamine agonist, {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} off periods and dyskinesia in late PD. It is administered by <b>intermittent</b> injections or continuous subcutaneous infusions. Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored. Two dopamine agonists that are administered through skin patches (lisuride and rotigotine) and are useful for people in the initial stages and possibly to control off states in those in the advanced state.|$|E
5|$|Brasilia Center then unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to contact the}} Embraer six more times, between 16:30 and 16:34. At 16:30 the Embraer's primary radar target became <b>intermittent,</b> and disappeared completely from the radar screen by 16:38, eight minutes later. Brasilia Center unsuccessfully {{attempted to}} effect a handoff of the Embraer to Amazonic Center at 16:53, by calling the Embraer in the blind.|$|E
5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of lead poisoning in adults are commonly nonspecific and include depression, loss of appetite, <b>intermittent</b> abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and muscle pain. Other early signs in adults include malaise, fatigue, decreased libido, and problems with sleep. An unusual taste {{in the mouth}} and personality changes are also early signs.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the programme became a joint development between Russia and Ukraine. The former compounded the issue of a reduced market with its <b>intermittent</b> commitment to the project. Repeated attempts to start production have been unsuccessful. Western European countries, including Germany, at one stage assessed the aircraft for procurement but later decided against it.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Nothofagus {{leaves in}} the Meyer Desert Formation of the Sirius Group show that <b>intermittent</b> warm periods allowed Nothofagus shrubs to cling to the Dominion Range as late as 3–4 Ma (mid-late Pliocene).

In 1841 an Act of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly conferred university powers on Dalhousie.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{after the}} multi-platinum success of Weezer's self-titled debut album, Weezer {{took a break}} from touring for the Christmas holidays. In {{his home state of}} Connecticut, {{songwriter}} Rivers Cuomo began preparing material for Weezer's next album using an 8-track recorder. His original concept was a science fiction rock opera titled Songs from the Black Hole that expressed his mixed feelings about success. Weezer developed Songs from the Black Hole through <b>intermittent</b> recording sessions throughout 1995.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{spend much}} of their time resting and are {{inactive}} for about 20hours per day. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming, and defecating. <b>Intermittent</b> bursts of activity follow through the night hours until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50minutes eating.|$|E
5|$|Off-grid system {{users can}} either adapt to <b>intermittent</b> power or use batteries, {{photovoltaic}} or diesel systems {{to supplement the}} wind turbine. Equipment such as parking meters, traffic warning signs, street lighting, or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a small wind turbine, possibly combined with a photovoltaic system, that charges a small battery replacing {{the need for a}} connection to the power grid.|$|E
5|$|Prevention {{options for}} at-risk {{individuals}} include early and frequent walking, calf exercises, anticoagulants, aspirin, graduated compression stockings, and <b>intermittent</b> pneumatic compression. Anticoagulation {{is the standard}} treatment; typical medications include low-molecular-weight heparin or a vitamin K antagonist. Wearing graduated compression stockings appears {{to reduce the risk}} of post-thrombotic syndrome. The rate of DVTs increases from childhood to old age; in adulthood, about one in 1000 adults is affected per year.|$|E
5|$|Pulmonary oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{an entirely}} avoidable event while diving. The limited duration and naturally <b>intermittent</b> nature of most diving makes this a relatively rare (and even then, reversible) complication for divers. Established guidelines enable divers to calculate when they {{are at risk of}} pulmonary toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{that a major}} Japanese {{attack was}} underway, Puller {{requested}} reinforcement. At 03:45, the 3rd Battalion, 164th Infantry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Hall and being held in reserve, was fed piecemeal into Puller's line. In spite of the darkness and <b>intermittent</b> heavy rain, the Army National Guard troops were placed in Puller's defences before daybreak.|$|E
5|$|Several highly lethal viral {{pathogens}} {{are members}} of the Filoviridae. Filoviruses are filament-like viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever, and include ebolaviruses and marburgviruses. Marburg virus, first discovered in 1967, attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 for an outbreak in Angola. Ebola Virus Disease has also caused <b>intermittent</b> outbreaks with high mortality rates since 1976 when it was first identified. The worst and most recent one is the West Africa epidemic.|$|E
5|$|Stacy Warner (Sela Ward), House's ex-girlfriend, {{appears in}} the final two episodes of the first season, and seven episodes of season two.

5|$|The Great Plague, lasting from 1665 to 1666, was {{the last}} major {{epidemic}} of the bubonic plague to occur in England. It happened within the centuries-long time period of the Second Pandemic, {{an extended period of}} <b>intermittent</b> bubonic plague epidemics which began in Europe in 1347, {{the first year of the}} Black Death, an outbreak which included other forms such as pneumonic plague, and lasted until 1750.|$|E
5|$|The JNA intervened {{directly}} against Croatia for {{the first}} time on 3 July 1991, driving Croatian forces out of Baranja, north of the city of Osijek, and out of Erdut, Aljmaš and Dalj east of Osijek. The advance was followed by <b>intermittent</b> fighting around Osijek, Vukovar and Vinkovci. At several points, JNA positions approached to within several hundred yards of Osijek city limits.|$|E
5|$|The MTR usually charges {{less for}} {{journeys}} made using an Octopus card instead of conventional single-journey tickets. For example, the adult fare {{of a single}} journey from Chai Wan to Tung Chung is HK$25.20 with an Octopus card, and HK$28 with a single journey ticket. Other public transport operators also offer <b>intermittent</b> discounts for using Octopus cards on higher fares and round-trip transits on select routes.|$|E
5|$|The {{clouds of}} Venus {{are capable of}} {{producing}} lightning much like the clouds on Earth. The existence of lightning had been controversial outside of the former Soviet Union since the first suspected bursts were detected by the Soviet Venera probes. However, in 2006–2007 Venus Express was reported to detect whistler mode waves, which were attributed to lightning. Their <b>intermittent</b> appearance indicates a pattern associated with weather activity. The lightning rate is {{at least half of}} that on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The coin toss {{featured}} former Virginia Tech star Bruce Smith, while Kansas {{was represented}} by Gale Sayers. Kansas won the toss and elected to defer its choice until the second half.

At kickoff, the air temperature was unseasonably cold for Miami at , and the skies were cloudy with <b>intermittent</b> rain.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known clock with a water-powered escapement mechanism, which transferred {{rotational energy}} into <b>intermittent</b> motions, {{dates back to}} 3rd century in ancient Greece; Chinese engineers later invented clocks incorporating mercury-powered escapement mechanisms in the 10th century, followed by Iranian engineers inventing water clocks driven by gears and weights in the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} a Whippet is large and slow beating, often being arrhythmic or even <b>intermittent</b> when the animal is at rest. This {{sometimes}} causes concern to the owner, or to the vet not experienced with the breed. Whippets will, however, demonstrate a regular heartbeat during exercise. In a health survey conducted by The Kennel Club cardiac problems were shown to be the second leading cause of mortality in Whippets.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{attracting}} American fans through television {{has long been}} a goal of the CFL although the results have been <b>intermittent.</b> As early as 1954, the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (forerunner of the CFL's East Division) struck a deal with NBC that lasted a year and featured 13 games. The infamous Fog Bowl of 1962 was—at least until play was suspended—broadcast by ABC. Over subsequent years various non-major networks picked up an assortment of games.|$|E
