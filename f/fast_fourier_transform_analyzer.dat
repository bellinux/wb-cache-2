Industry now a day is also promoting the use of composites over other conventional materials for structural purposes.

Composite plates used as structural elements are generally subjected to various shapes, sizes and design of cut-outs. These cut-out servers for various practical uses for the designers. In this study basically {{the study of the}} modal characteristics of the glass fibre epoxy composite plates in the presence of different cut-outs was taken up. The study was a combination of experiments and analytical modelling. Parameters such as size of cut-out, different thickness of plate with same size of cut-out, distance of cut-out from support and relative position of the cut-out was studied.

40|$|The {{categorization}} of speech sounds by the auditory {{system has been}} a subject of intense attention over several decades, reflecting its importance to {{the scientific study of}} speech perception and the technological development of more human-like capabilities in automatic speech recognition. In previous work, we have firmly established that a two-stage computational model can mimic important aspects of the speech categorization behavior of human and animal listeners. The first stage employs a biologicallymotivated ‘front-end’, modeling the peripheral auditory system, and the second stage is a trainable artificial neural network ‘back-end’, modeling more central processes. When suitably trained on synthetic stimuli, the two-stage system is able to reproduce the important effects of category formation for the class of initial plosive-stop speech sounds, and movement of the category boundary with place of articulation. Appropriate behavior is maintained across a variety of ‘back-end ’ architectures and associated learning algorithms. The behavior is emergent in that it was not explicitly programmed into the model. These facts imply that there is something very basic about categorization behavior. Unlike real (human and animal) listeners, a software model can be interrogated to find out the contribution of its component parts to the overall behavior. Replacing the auditory front-end by a more prosaic <b>fast</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> <b>analyzer</b> allows us to focus on the contribution of the acousticto-auditory transformation to categorization.

40|$|International audienceIn space application, {{the demand}} for high-stability quartz {{oscillators}} is ever increasing. The highest stability, {{of the order of}} 5 × 10 – 14 Allan deviation at 5 – 30 s measurement time, has been achieved with 5 – 10 MHz bulk acoustic-wave resonators, yet only after careful selection from a significantly larger production. The small improvement obtained at great effort in the past 15 years seems to indicate that the target stability of 10 – 14 is still not around the corner. In this quest, some discrepancies between the measurement of oscillators and resonators indicates that metrology is a critical point. At the state of the art, the experimental investigation on the resonator's frequency stability relies on the bridge (interferometric) method 1, in which the quartz is used as a passive device, with no sustaining amplifier. The instrument is based on the synchronous detection of the noise sideband after suppressing the carrier by vector sum of an equal and opposite reference signal. The detected noise is measured with a <b>fast</b> <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> <b>analyzer.</b> Since a reference source of noise lower than that of the resonators under test is not available, we use a symmetric scheme that compares two equal resonators, rejecting the noise of the source. An advanced version of this instrument has been implemented at FEMTO-ST, in collaboration with the CNES and with the major European manufacturers of high stability resonators 2. The usual way to calibrate the system is to inject in one arm of the bridge a sideband of known frequency and amplitude. The instrument gain is calculated from the amplitude of the detected signal. We observed that this practice may be incorrect. The reason is that the non-linearity, inherent in the quartz lattice, warps the shape of the frequency response, breaking the symmetry between upper and lower sidebands. Consequently, the quartz is no longer described by a 2 nd-order linear differential equation. This phenomenon is definitely not negligible at the power levels of interest. The measurement of a few batches from different manufacturers reveals inconsistencies correlated to power. After reviewing the state of the art, this article proposes a new calibration method...|$|E
