For example, mounted police horses are still effective for {{certain types of}} patrol duties and crowd control. Cattle ranches still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote, rugged terrain. Search and rescue organizations in some countries depend upon mounted teams to locate people, particularly hikers and children, and to provide disaster relief assistance. Horses {{can also be used}} in areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil, such as nature reserves. They may also be the only form of transport allowed in wilderness areas. Horses are quieter than motorized vehicles. Law enforcement officers such as park rangers or game wardens may use horses for patrols, and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective.|$|E

Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in Le Révolté that [...] "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite". A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the trade union movement.

[...] Cruft overhauled the bookkeeping in the shop, changing it from a system using crosses to distinguish between wholesale and retail customers to a far more detailed system. The Maltese cross that was previously used in the bookkeeping was later instead stamped onto the biscuits as a type of trademark to distinguish Spratt's biscuits from other dog biscuits.|$|E

The fort was restored in 1847 but was now used more as a prison than for defending the Kingdom. The cannons were rusting and the fort was mostly empty of personnel except for a few soldiers and the Governor of Maui who lived there. When Henry Augustus Wise visited in 1848, he met James Young (1797–1851), then Governor of Maui, who was living in the fort.

Based on its total gross, it was considered a box office bomb. The results were well below studio expectations, given that the production costs of Speed Racer were estimated to be over $120 million. Despite the low box office numbers, Warner Bros. remained optimistic about sales of associated products ranging from toys to tennis shoes. Brad Globe, president of Warner Bros.

Paul Merson scored twice against Middlesbrough as Arsenal recorded a 3–0 win and moved into second place, just two points behind Norwich City. Arsenal's five England internationals, who featured against Saudi Arabia a week before, were lauded in The Times for their performances, despite playing tamely for country.

500|$|... "Take a Bow" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Upon the song's release {{as an official}} single, Nick Levine of Digital Spy commented its choice {{for the promotion of}} Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded, writing that the singer could have chosen [...] "Breakin' Dishes" [...] which served as a promotional single for Good Girl Gone Bad and charted at number four on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart in February 2008—but had opted for [...] "Take a Bow" [...] due to it being new and more likely to find a receptive audience. Levine continued in his review to write that although the ballad succeeds in its mission of telling of a failed relationship, he noted that the song was not at the same level as the singer's previous single, [...] "Don't Stop the Music" [...] (2007). Levine cited that his reason for this was that [...] "'Take a Bow' does what it sets out to <b>do</b> <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> but it's an underwhelming follow-up to the dancefloor rush of 'Don't Stop The Music". Levine also commented on the song with regard to the other new songs included on the re-release, [...] "Disturbia" [...] and [...] "If I Never See Your Face Again" [...] (a collaboration with Maroon 5), as part of his review of Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded, writing that [...] "Take a Bow" [...] is inferior to the former, but superior to the latter. Natalie Zfat of Rolling Stone gave it three and a half out of five stars.|$|E
500|$|May did {{not play}} for Millwall {{at the start of}} the 2003–04 season, and was {{consequently}} loaned out once more, this time to Brentford on 25 August 2003. He joined the club on an initial three-month loan deal. He made his debut in Brentford's 2–1 home win against Oldham Athletic, playing the whole match. May scored his first goal for Brentford two weeks later, on 6 September 2003, in a 3–1 loss against Plymouth Argyle, scoring the goal that briefly tied the game at 1–1. He received the first red card of his career when he was sent-off for violent conduct in a Football League Trophy match against Barnet on 14 October 2003. Four days later, he scored Brentford's fourth goal in the 87th minute in a 4–2 victory against Luton Town, turning in Jay Tabb's cross. In Brentford's next league fixture, May scored his third goal of the season, [...] "bundling home Brentford's third" [...] in a 4–0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion at Griffin Park. In November 2007, May's loan deal was extended until the end of the 2003–04 season. Millwall manager Dennis Wise stated [...] "He will <b>do</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> under Brentford manager Wally Downes and will learn a lot under him. I didn't feel he was quite ready for our first-team just yet". A month later, he scored the opening goal of the game in a 2–1 home defeat against Bristol City on 26 December 2003, scoring with a header from Stephen Hunt's corner. May scored two goals in the space of a week in January 2004, scoring the equaliser in games against Oldham and Tranmere Rovers respectively. He scored his seventh goal of the 2003–04 campaign in a 2–1 loss at Swindon Town — [...] "confidently firing home a left-footed shot from ten yards", although Brentford went on to lose their fourth consecutive match. It was May's last goal of the season, in all he scored seven goals in 43 appearances as Brentford finished the season in 17th place. He returned to his parent club in May 2004.|$|E

2500|$|Antwerp {{was then}} Europe's largest {{financial}} and international trading centre, taking {{as much as}} 75 or 80% of English exports of cloth, and the disturbances created serious and well-justified fears that its position as such was under threat. Sir Thomas Gresham, the English financier who arranged Elizabeth I's borrowings, and whose agent in Antwerp was Clough, left London for Antwerp on August 23, only hearing about the Antwerp attacks en route; he needed to roll-over 32,000 Flemish pounds and borrow another 20,000 to finance her expenses in Ireland.

2500|$|The album's most {{positive}} review to date came from Cameron Adams, {{writing for the}} Brisbane-based newspaper The Courier-Mail. Adams approved the band's decision {{to follow up on}} the sound of their commercially successful debut album, Conditions, marking the album as [...] "faithful" [...] in his one-word description of the album. Adams noted [...] "Lost" [...] and [...] "Fall Together" [...] as the album's two potential hits, describing them as [...] "better than 90-per-cent of what's in the charts and on the radio now." [...] While he felt that the album [...] "bit over-thought in parts - like they needed help to do what once came naturally to get the blasted record out", he concluded his review by stating that Thick as Thieves was [...] "undeniably strong, if lacking risks - this is everything The Temper Trap <b>do</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> indeed." [...] Also approving of the reversion to the sound of Conditions was Jules LeFevre of Australian music magazine website FasterLouder, who noted, [...] "at first glance [...] appears to be an attempt to reclaim the spotlight on the festival stages, but on closer inspection reveals a sturdy core." [...] LeFevre praised Mandagi's falsetto vocals as the album's strongest element, claiming it to be the band's [...] "edge", on top of the [...] "colossal, anthemic choruses, sky high hooks, [...] guitar lines that push and push and push and explode." [...] LeFevre continued by praising the largely guitar-driven composition of the record, in spite of Lorenzo Sillitto's exit, and commented positively on the [...] "simpler, gritter, more blues and classic rock driven" [...] guitars helmed by Joseph Greer. Contrasting to this, however, is LeFevre's sharp criticism of the album's lyricism, describing them as [...] "cringe-worthy", and disapproving of songs such as [...] "Lost" [...] and [...] "Fall Together", although stating that the lyrics felt [...] "comfortable" [...] in context of the music itself. Matt Collar of the American-based online music guide AllMusic noted that the departure of Sillitto and Greer's move into the role as lead guitarist had virtually no effect on the band's music. In writing a positive review for AllMusic, he also praised Mandagi's vocals as a [...] "powerful and emotive" [...] presence on the album, commenting on the [...] "scintillating" [...] combination of his vocals and the album's [...] "thick wave of electric guitars, pulsing synths, and drums", comparing the sound to the music of Cee Lo Green and The Killers. Collar additionally described Thick as Thieves as [...] "a heartfelt love letter to The Temper Trap's fans who have stuck with them since Conditions." ...|$|E
