The general government and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) often provide goods and services to households for their individual consumption free of charge or at reduced prices.

This paper provides equivalence scales based on revealed preference consumption microdata for West Germany 1983.

We concentrate on a single equation expenditure method with different Engel approaches as well as on a complete demand system approach. The complete demand system approach provides true, constant utility based equivalence scales and is specified by an extended linear expenditure system (ELES). While the Engel methods traditionally focus on food expenditures, the multiple equation expenditure system takes into account a full market basket with all its interdependencies and relative prices. Our equivalence scale study for West Germany based on actual available <b>individual</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>expenditure</b> data shows a variety of interesting results with regard to different goods and services baskets as well as to different household composition effects including the situation of the elderly, of the families with married couples and single mothers, and the cost of children.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{economic}} {{status of the}} elderly in {{late nineteenth and early}} twentieth century America. It has been widely believed that reduced earnings of ageing workers in these periods were fully supplemented by increased earnings of children. The patterns of <b>individual</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>expenditures,</b> however, indicate that children's supports were no longer an important means of old-age security after the end of the nineteenth century. Older males who were out of the labour force were much poorer than active workers of a similar age. The retired were not as much protected by family support as active workers. This result indicates that the previous studies based mainly on active workers overstate the extent of economic progress of the entire elderly population in the industrial era. This study tends to support the conventional belief that the rise of the welfare state was a response to the emerging social problems in the era of industrialization such as unemployment, poverty, and dependence of the elderly.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. During 1998, in line with other European Union (EU) member states, the UK adopted the new European System of Accounts (ESA 95), {{to be used by}} the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for the production of financial data. In September 1998 the UK National Accounts were published for the first time using ESA 95. Under this system, ONS is required to compile more detailed regional economic information than was previously the case and now produces regional Gross Value Added (GVA - formerly Gross Domestic Product or GDP, to which some series still refer), regional Household Accounts and regional Gross Fixed Capital Formation. Most Regional Accounts data are now consistent with ESA 95 - users should refer to the information in the 'Main Topics' section below, and the documentation. Regional Accounts data are compiled mainly from the UK National Accounts (Blue Book), the New Earnings Survey (NES) and the Annual Business Inquiry (ABI 2). For the 8 th edition (December 2002), data files covering Gross Value Added (GVA - formerly GDP) by GOR, Industry, Manufacturing Class and other tables were added to the dataset. On 10 th December 2002, however, ONS withdrew the 8 th edition GVA data files, due to errors discovered in the data.

Using data on <b>individual</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>expenditures</b> from {{a sample}} of farm {{households}} in the Philippines, we construct a direct test of the risk-sharing implications of the collective household model. We are able to contrast the efficient outcomes predicted by the collective household model with the outcomes we might expect in environments in which food consumption delivers not only utils, but also nutrients which affect future productivity. Finally, {{we are able to}} contrast each of these two models with a third, involving a hidden action problem within the household; in this case, the efficient provision of incentives implies that the consumption of each household member depends on their (stochastic) productivity. The efficiency conditions which characterize the within-household allocation of food under the collective household model are violated, as consumption shares respond to earnings shocks. If future productivity depends on current nutrition, then this can explain some but not all of the response, as it appears that the quality of current consumption depends on past earnings. This suggests that actions taken by household members may be private, giving rise to a moral hazard problem within the household. 1...|$|R

40|$|Bill and Herb have {{provided}} an illuminating and interesting presentation of Irving Fisher's Ph. D. dissertation Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices. They correctly emphasize that Fisher's fundamental {{contribution to the}} early theory of general equilibrium was {{the construction of a}} machine to compute the equilibrium quantities in a Walrasian model of competitive markets. As Fisher notes, Walras deserves priority for deriving a system of equations that characterize equilibrium in competitive markets. Even in this area, however, Fisher makes a subtle and interesting contribution in his system of equilibrium equations, discussed later. The first modern treatment of computing equilibrium prices in Walrasian economies is due to Herb, as everyone in this audience knows. His seminal paper, “On the Computation of Equilibrium Prices,” appears, most appropriately, in Ten Essays in Honor of Irving Fisher. The modern treatment of the existence question in the general equilibrium model, due to Arrow and Debreu, converts the equilibrium conditions into a fixed point of a continuous map, say from the price simplex into itself. It follows from Brouwer's fixed point theorem that this map will have a fixed point. The Scarf algorithm computes approximate fixed points of any continuous map of the simplex into itself. Hence the Scarf algorithm can be used to compute equilibrium quantities. Subsequent to Scarf's research, a more direct method of solving nonlinear systems of equilibrium equations was suggested by Eaves. The so-called homotopy method deforms a set of equations whose solution we know into the equilibrium equations, tracing out a path of solutions terminating in a solution for the equilibrium equations. Unfortunately, there is no price-adjustment interpretation of the disequilibrium prices along the homotopy path. In this way they are similar to the prices generated by the Fisher machine out of equilibrium. Below we give a system of equations characterizing equilibrium in an exchange economy with two agents and three goods. Agents are assumed to be endowed with money income and additive separable utility functions, which are monotone, strictly concave, and smooth. The unknowns in our equations are the state variables of Fisher's machine, in other words, prices, <b>individual</b> <b>consumptions,</b> <b>expenditures,</b> marginal utilities of income, and marginal utilities of the <b>consumptions</b> implied by <b>expenditures</b> and prices. Equilibrium values are computed using the homotopy method...|$|R
