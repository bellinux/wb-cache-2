500|$|The album {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{who gave it}} {{four out of five}} stars, wrote [...] "what gives Breakaway its spine are the driving, anthemic pop tunes, numbers that sound simultaneously mainstream and youthful, which is a hard trick to pull off" [...] and describing the tracks as the ones that illustrate Clarkson as a rare thing in the 2000s: [...] "a pop singer who's neither hip nor square, just solidly and enjoyably in the mainstream." [...] Sputnikmusic's Dave Donnelly gave it a [...] "4" [...] rating, remarking that [...] "Breakaway is not a Thriller to her Off The Wall by no means, but she has at least created a rare type of album: a one that offers a full selection of potential singles, reminiscent of Michael Jackson's Bad or Thriller, which he described as having a mass appeal with artistic integrity and perceived longevity. Breakaway may be remembered in years to come as a pop classic, alongside Madonna's early material perhaps." [...] Raymond Fiore of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "B" [...] rating, noting it's rock direction and describing it as [...] "Avril-meets-Evanescence, with a splash of Pat Benatar." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave Breakaway a three-and-a-half star rating and commented that [...] "though her rocky leanings were hinted at on the less coherent Thankful, Clarkson had always cited Mariah Carey as a primary influence and that she still owes a lot to that former powerhouse artist." [...] Furthering describing it as [...] "what Mariah might sound like if she ever decided to rock out." [...] Charles Merwin wrote for Stylus Magazine that the album's probable non-singles still maintain a quality [...] "high enough to quell worries about the [...] "I love the singles, but that's all <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> hear" [...] arguments." [...] He described Clarkson as ranking some where {{at the top of her}} class as far as rock albums go among the teen pop set, saying that she [...] "has a long way to go before we'll ever feel comfortable calling her anything besides an American Idol, but for now she has a sound that seems believable enough to support her considerable chops." [...] In a quick review, Billboard described Breakaway as a [...] "rare exhibition of substance over style".|$|E

The television broadcasting of the event consisted of an introduction to the band by various famous admirers (including Roger Taylor, Slash, Joe Perry, Steven Tyler, Jack White and Tony Iommi), a presentation of an award to Jimmy Page and then a short speech by the guitarist. After this, rock group Wolfmother played a tribute to Led Zeppelin, playing the song [...] "Communication Breakdown". [...] During an interview for the BBC in connection with the induction, Page expressed plans to record new material in 2007, saying: [...] "It's an album that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> get out of my system...there's a good album in there and it's ready to come out" [...] and [...] "Also there will be some Zeppelin things on the horizon." ...|$|E

2500|$|At first, {{it might}} {{appear that the}} boyfriend is {{straight}} up busted. But it's more complicated than that, especially as you see Mýa and her girls engaged in their own energetic calisthenics, then (apparently) commanding their male admirers to hit the ground and perform push-ups, constructing a kind of reciprocal relationship that, for instance, Christina Aguilera's video for [...] "What a Girl Wants" [...] cannot do, in its celebration of the most excellent boyfriend {{whose job is to}} be endlessly appreciative of his girlfriend's super-gloriousness (see also, Christina's video for Genie in a Bottle," [...] in which she also dances seductively with a group of girls for a group of boys). Director Diane Martel has done her share of conventionally alluring Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera videos, but here the terms have shifted. Mýa and her girls—in moves recalling Janet's—don't pretend to be charming or enticing. Instead, they present themselves as young women with demands and desires, proudly hard-bodied and self-possessed.Mýa can rock the midriff tops like any other pop star, but as always, she remains slightly offbeat, neither apologetic nor solicitous. Sexy and self-assured without being coy, she knows who she is and what she wants, and says it outright: [...] "What'cha gonna do / When you can't say no / And your feelings start to show? / Boy <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know / And how you gonna act?" [...] In Mýa's world, it's not the girl who turns emotional and unsure of herself when a question of integrity arises, but the more fragile, less stable boy. She warns,"There's no need to / Reminisce about the past, / Obviously, 'cause that shit did not last." [...] The video's imagery underlines her admonition, as the camera shoots up at her looking unafraid and austere, backed by her crew as the dust flies from their work-out: [...] "She don't know me / She's about to know me / I'm in your life / That's how it's gon' be." [...] And if you want to mess around, you're free to choose, but it will cost: [...] "If you want her back / You can take her back. / Cause game recognize game. / I could do the same thing." [...] And she does. At the end of the [...] video, Mýa and her dancers exit, leaving their audience dusty and on their own.|$|E
