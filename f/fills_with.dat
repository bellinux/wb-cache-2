5|$|Samuel {{eventually}} {{turns up}} drunk {{at a local}} bar, his faith shaken by the death. He is taken into custody. The agents doubt his ability, but {{he is able to}} convince Mulder that he knows the latter has lost a sister—Samantha—at a young age. Mulder has been seeing visions of Samantha, and continues to see them. At Samuel's bail hearing, the courtroom <b>fills</b> <b>with</b> a swarm of locusts, which Samuel claims is a sign of God's wrath against him.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the game is to get the highest score. There are two play modes: Zen and Core. There is a 90-second time limit in Zen mode. In Core mode, players play until the screen <b>fills</b> <b>with</b> poorly placed tetrominos, similar to Tetris. Core has two difficulties. On the easiest difficulty, three-letter words suffice, but harder modes require five-letter words at a minimum. A score {{multiplier}} grows as players maintain a combo of multiple words created in succession, and resets if players are too slow. Scores are uploaded to Game Center.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{skeletal}} muscle may take various forms. Crush and other physical injuries cause damage to muscle cells directly or interfere with blood supply, while non-physical causes interfere with muscle cell metabolism. When damaged, muscle tissue rapidly <b>fills</b> <b>with</b> fluid from the bloodstream, including sodium ions. The swelling itself {{may lead to}} destruction of muscle cells, but those cells that survive are subject to various disruptions that lead to rise in intracellular calcium ions; the accumulation of calcium outside the sarcoplasmic reticulum leads to continuous muscle contraction and depletion of ATP, the main carrier {{of energy in the}} cell. ATP depletion can itself lead to uncontrolled calcium influx. The persistent contraction of the muscle cell leads to breakdown of intracellular proteins and disintegration of the cell.|$|E

5|$|Enemy {{encounters}} {{trigger a}} combat mode. As in Chrono Trigger, enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush {{the party and}} thus are not random. Similar to Final Fantasys Active Time Battle, each character has a meter that gradually <b>fills</b> <b>with</b> time. When the meter is full, characters can physically attack enemies, use MysTech magic, unleash BattleSkill attacks, use items, move to a different position, or use a nearby object to attack, if present. For playable characters and computer-controlled enemies, each attack has their number of hit points (a numerically based life bar) get reduced, which can be restored through healing items or MysTech slags. Use of MysTech and equippable shield cells require Neutron-Radiated Glodents (NRG), a separate energy reserve displayed beneath a character's life bar. NRG is replenished through certain items. Use of BattleSkills require Bouge, a third bar beneath NRG that automatically <b>fills</b> <b>with</b> time; players can use different BattleSkills depending on how full the Bouge bar is. Some characters must undergo certain plot developments to unlock their BattleSkills. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints. If all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved game. Winning battles earns experience points and raises characters' levels, granting them improved statistics. These statistics can be viewed through the status screen, which displays important character information and current quests. Unlike many other RPGs, Anachronox displays a character's attributes with qualitative descriptors (such as Poor and Excellent) instead of integers.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Chirocephalus diaphanus is {{extremely}} fast. The typical duration of a full life cycle is not known, but a figure of around 3 months has been suggested. The eggs are tolerant to drying out; when their habitat <b>fills</b> <b>with</b> water again, some of the eggs will hatch, while others remain dormant. This enables the species to continue to survive in an unpredictable habitat, since some eggs remain in case the habitat does not persist for {{long enough for the}} animals to mate and produce offspring. Dispersal between bodies of water can occur through the movements of animals such as cattle, deer and horses.|$|E
5|$|The player {{continues}} to {{journey into the}} remains of a once sprawling city {{at the base of the}} mountain. Eventually making it safely to the mountain, the traveler begins to climb it, struggling as they enter the colder climates and encounter deep snow and high winds. With the crevice still a fair distance away, the traveler falls and collapses in the snow. Six of the white-robed figures appear before the character and grant the traveler new energy, allowing the player to reach the summit of the mountain and walk into the crevice as the screen <b>fills</b> <b>with</b> white. The player is then shown the game's credits, playing over the ending cinematic scene. This scene shows a shooting star emanating from the crevice and traversing the path the traveler took through the ruins, and shows glimpses of other robed travelers heading towards the mountain. Eventually, the star comes to rest at the sand dune where the game began, and the player is given the option of starting the game again. As the credits end, the player is shown the PlayStation Network IDs of the other travelers who shared part of the trek.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{atmospheric}} convection—the ordinary {{process of}} lower, warm air rising—inversions leave cooler air suspended below warm air, preventing the lower air from rising and trapping airborne pollutants that would ordinarily disperse in the atmosphere. Such weather events are common, {{but they are}} usually followed by a strong cold front that brings an influx of clean air and disperses pollutants before they {{have enough time to}} become highly concentrated; in this case, a cold front approaching west through southern Canada was delayed. When explained in less formal terms, the process of an inversion causing a smog event has been compared to a lid that holds in pollutants or a balloon that <b>fills</b> <b>with</b> pollutants. In general, smog events occur not because of a sudden increase in a region's output of pollution, but rather because weather conditions like stagnant air prevent the dispersal of pollutants that were already present.|$|E

40|$|Circular {{steel tube}} <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> steel-reinforced {{high-strength}} concrete {{is a new}} model of composite column design. The fire resistance of this composite column was investigated experimentally. One circular steel tube column <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> steel-reinforced high-strength concrete and one circular steel tube column <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> high- strength concrete were tested under axial load and fire. The test results show that the axial deformations of both kinds of the composite columns under the same load level have experienced three stages variation:the initial expansion deformation stage,the compression deformation gradual growth stage and the damage stage with the dramatic increasing in compression deformation. The second compression stable development stage of the circular steel tube <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> steel-reinforced high-strength concrete is much longer than that of the circular steel tube column <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> high-strength concrete. Thus the fire endurance of the circular steel tube <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> steel-reinforced high-strength concrete reaches 166 minutes while the fire endurance of the circular steel tube column <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> high-strength concrete only reaches 46 minutes. Thus encasig section steel can remarkably improve the fire endurance of the circular steel tube <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> high-strength concrete. The research results can provide beneficial reference for the fire design of circular steel tube composite columns <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> steel-reinforced concrete...|$|R
25|$|The malaria parasite, therefore, detoxifies the hematin, {{which it}} does by biocrystallization—converting it into {{insoluble}} and chemically inert β-hematin crystals (called hemozoin). In Plasmodium the food vacuole <b>fills</b> <b>with</b> hemozoin crystals, which are about 100-200 nanometres long and each contain about 80,000 heme molecules. Detoxification through biocrystallization {{is distinct from}} the detoxification process in mammals, where an enzyme called heme oxygenase instead breaks excess heme into biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide.|$|E

This requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent necrosis of the stomach wall and death of the dog. During surgery, the stomach is deflated and put back into its normal position. A gastropexy may be performed, whereby the stomach {{is attached to the}} body wall to prevent this condition from recurring. A splenectomy or partial gastrectomy may also be required.|$|E

25|$|Traditional sailboats are monohulls, but {{multi-hull}} catamarans and trimarans {{are gaining}} popularity. Monohull boats generally rely on ballast for stability and usually are displacement hulls. This stabilizing ballast can, in {{boats designed for}} racing, {{be as much as}} 50% of the weight of the boat, but is generally around 30%. It creates two problems; one, it gives the monohull tremendous inertia, making it less maneuverable and reducing its acceleration. Secondly, unless it has been built with buoyant foam or air tanks, if a monohull <b>fills</b> <b>with</b> water, it will sink.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, diving {{stores were}} finding a purely {{economic}} reason to offer nitrox: {{not only was}} an entire new course and certification needed to use it, but instead of cheap or free tank <b>fills</b> <b>with</b> compressed air, dive shops found they could charge premium amounts of money for custom-gas blending of nitrox to their ordinary, moderately experienced divers. With the new dive computers which could be programmed {{to allow for the}} longer bottom-times and shorter residual nitrogen times that nitrox gave, the incentive for the sport diver to use the gas increased. An intersection of economics and scientific validity had occurred.|$|E
25|$|A {{tailings}} dam is typically an earth-fill embankment dam used to store tailings, which are produced during mining operations after separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore. Conventional water retention dams can serve this purpose, {{but due to}} cost, a {{tailings dam}} is more viable. Unlike water retention dams, a tailings dam is raised in succession throughout {{the life of the}} particular mine. Typically, a base or starter dam is constructed, and as it <b>fills</b> <b>with</b> a mixture of tailings and water, it is raised. Material used to raise the dam can include the tailings (depending on their size) along with dirt.|$|E

For this reason, control of particle size distribution can be quite important in the choice of aggregate; appropriate simulations or experiments are necessary to determine the optimal proportions of different-sized particles.|$|R

25|$|The small {{particles}} of iron produced {{in this way}} fall {{to the bottom of}} the furnace and become welded together to form a spongy mass of the bloom. The bottom of the furnace also <b>fills</b> <b>with</b> molten slag, often consisting of fayalite, a compound of silicon, oxygen and iron mixed with other impurities from the ore. Because the bloom is highly porous, and its open spaces are full of slag, the bloom must later be reheated and beaten with a hammer to drive the molten slag out of it. Iron treated this way is said to be wrought, and the resulting nearly pure iron wrought iron.|$|E
25|$|The {{maintenance}} of the canal was {{a real problem for}} the descendants of Riquet. Despite many precautions, the canal silts up with silt from the water supply. In addition it <b>fills</b> <b>with</b> the branches and leaves of trees. Every winter, a period of closure allows the cleaning of the canal. It is necessary to re-dig the canal bed every year for two months. These works are expensive and two months is not always sufficient. Another problem is the invasion of the canal by weeds in the levels and spillways. There is no way to eradicate this scourge. In 1820 dredging was set up to pull up the weeds and the mud layer.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the rest}} of Querétaro's notable sites are located in the {{historic}} center, which is pedestrian-friendly and filled with colonial architecture. The local government maintains this area well, with cleaning crews to keep the streets clean and regulating vendors so that they do not block streets and sidewalks. In the evening, the area <b>fills</b> <b>with</b> people strolling the plazas and walkways and frequenting the area's restaurants, cafes and food stands. One way to see this part of town is the Noche de Leyendas (Night of Legends), which is a hybrid between interactive theater and a recounting of history. A group of actors guide visitors through the streets of the city narrating stories about what has happened in these places. This event begins at the main plaza, the Plaza de Armas {{in the center of the}} city with a reenactment of the legend of Carambada. Then the show wanders the street all the while telling tales related to bandits, loves and myths. These tales demand audience participation providing lines and provoking debate.|$|E
