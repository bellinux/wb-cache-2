5|$|His {{business}} interests having collapsed, Baker abandoned his farm and relocated from New South Wales {{to the southern}} settlement of Hobart in Van Diemen's Land. In 1814 he is recorded as holding the office of government storekeeper in Hobart. A year later, at an approximate age of 54, he accepted a job as town crier for the newly created <b>Deputy</b> <b>Judge</b> Advocate's Court, calling witnesses and announcing verdicts on the roadside outside the courthouse. Any remaining business links with New South Wales were severed in 1819 with the sale of Baker's former farm to a colleague, Samuel Terry, who had recently visited him in Hobart. His wife, Elizabeth Baker, died in April 1824 and was buried in Hobart Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|After {{establishing}} a legal {{career in the}} field of insolvency, Stevenson served during the Second World War as a <b>Deputy</b> <b>Judge</b> Advocate General of the Armed Forces. He was subsequently Judge Advocate at the 1945 war crimes trial of former personnel of the German submarine U-852 for their actions in {{what became known as the}} Peleus affair. In 1954 Stevenson represented the government of British Kenya during Jomo Kenyatta's unsuccessful appeal against his conviction for membership of the rebel organisation Mau Mau. Later that year he represented the litigants in the Crichel Down affair, which led to changes in the law on compulsory purchase. In 1955 he defended Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be executed for murder in the United Kingdom, and two years later took part in the unsuccessful prosecution of suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams. He was deeply distressed by the execution of Ellis, for whom there had been no defence in law, but who was expected to have been reprieved by Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George.|$|E
25|$|Knox and Sollecito {{were held}} in prison. Their trial began on 16January 2009 before Judge Giancarlo Massei, <b>Deputy</b> <b>Judge</b> Beatrice Cristiani, and six lay judges at the Corte d'Assise of Perugia. The charges were that Knox, Sollecito, and Guede had murdered Kercher in her bedroom. Knox and Sollecito both pleaded not guilty.|$|E
50|$|The Federal Supreme Court numbers 19 <b>deputy</b> <b>judges,</b> who {{are also}} elected by the Federal Assembly. Of the <b>deputy</b> <b>judges</b> {{currently}} sitting on the bench, three have Italian, six French and 11 German as their native language. Nine of the <b>deputy</b> <b>judges</b> are women. The <b>deputy</b> federal <b>judges</b> serve in a part-time capacity, otherwise they are professors, practicing lawyers or cantonal judges. As a general rule, they serve asreplacements for judges who have recused themselves or have taken ill, or when the Court’s docket has become overly full. In the proceedings on which they sit {{they have the same}} rights and obligations as the ordinary federal judges.|$|R
50|$|The {{districts were}} sub-divided into tribal wards, with major datus serving as ward chiefs and minor datus serving as <b>deputies,</b> <b>judges,</b> and sheriffs.|$|R

25|$|Francisco {{himself was}} removed from office in 2132 by his corrupt <b>deputy,</b> <b>Judge</b> Sinfield, who brainwashed him with an illegal mind-altering drug to make him resign so Sinfield could take his place. However Sinfield {{discovered}} that even the chief judge is not above the law, when his crime was discovered and he was arrested. The Council of Five reinstated Francisco.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to their normal duties, county court judges act as notary public and bailiffs (in particular, the fogedret sees to the enforcement of judgments and legal claims), as well as administrators of bankruptcy proceedings and probate matters. Furthermore, they administer the local land registry. In regard to the administrative tasks, these functions may be assigned to an assessor, which is a <b>deputy</b> <b>judge.</b> An electronic reform of the land registry system is being implemented, making the system entirely electronic.|$|E
25|$|Hadrian Volt (2116–2121) {{restored}} the Council and instituted sweeping reforms {{to the office}} of chief judge (described above), and also {{restored the}} elected mayor and elected council of Mega-City One (which had not existed since the Apocalypse War). Blaming himself for failing to prevent the Robot War of 2121, he shot himself. As with Fargo’s death, this was concealed from the public and more creditable circumstances were invented. He was succeeded by his <b>deputy,</b> <b>Judge</b> Hershey, who was elected in her own right in 2122.|$|E

50|$|The Federal Court {{consists}} of a Chief Justice and thirty-two other judges. Currently, there are 28 full-time judges (leaving five vacancies in the Court), along with four supernumerary <b>judges,</b> six <b>deputy</b> <b>judges,</b> and six prothonotaries.|$|R
25|$|The {{judgement}} for {{the appeal}} was handed down on 12 January 2009 at the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. <b>Deputy</b> <b>Judge</b> President Louis Harms had {{to rule on}} two aspects of the appeal. The first aspect was whether or not Zuma {{had the right to}} be invited to make representations to the NPA before they decided to reinstate charges of bribery and corruption against him. The second aspect was whether Judge Nicholson was correct in implying political meddling by the then President Thabo Mbeki with regards to the NPA's decision to charge Zuma.|$|E
25|$|A {{review of}} the {{verdicts}} was completed on 23 April 1948 by the <b>Deputy</b> <b>Judge</b> Advocate for War Crimes, which were all confirmed with one exception: regarding the offender Oskar Helbig, the sentence of twenty years in prison was reduced to ten. The United States War Crimes Board of Review then conducted a second {{review of the}} recommendations. The military Governor of the American occupation zone, Lucius D. Clay, confirmed all the judgments according to the recommendations in the review process and pronounced them final on June 25, 1948.|$|E
25|$|The first {{panel was}} elected on 14 September 1921, with the 4 deputies being elected on the 16th. On the first vote, Rafael Altamira y Crevea of Spain, Dionisio Anzilotti of Italy, Bernard Loder of the Netherlands, Ruy Barbosa of Brazil, Yorozu Oda of Japan, Charles Andre Weiss of France, Antonio Sánchez de Bustamante y Sirven of Cuba and Lord Finlay of the United Kingdom were elected by a {{majority}} vote of both the Council and Assembly on the first ballot taken. The second ballot elected John Bassett Moore of the United States, and the sixth Didrik Nyholm of Denmark and Max Huber of Switzerland. As the deputy judges, Wang Ch'ung-hui of China, Demetre Negulesco of Romania and Michaelo Yovanovich of Yugoslavia were elected. The Assembly and Council disagreed on the fourth <b>deputy</b> <b>judge,</b> but Frederik Beichmann of Norway was eventually appointed. Deputy judges were only substitutes for absent judges and were not afforded a vote in altering court procedure or contributing at other times. As such, {{they were allowed to}} act as counsel in international cases where they were not sitting as judges.|$|E
50|$|Small-claims {{cases are}} heard by judges of the Provincial Court in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, by <b>judges</b> or <b>deputy</b> <b>judges</b> of the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, and by Hearing Officers in Manitoba.|$|R
50|$|The court {{itself is}} located in Hamar, and has one {{district}} stipendiary magistrate, four <b>judges</b> and two <b>deputy</b> <b>judges,</b> {{as well as an}} administrative staff of 12. Cases may be appealed to Eidsivating Court of Appeal, which is headquartered in Hamar as well.|$|R
25|$|Thirdly, the <b>deputy</b> chief <b>judge</b> is {{no longer}} {{guaranteed}} the automatic right of succession to the top job. Under the new system the deputy only becomes acting chief judge {{in the event of}} a vacancy in the highest office, and only becomes chief judge in his own right if subsequently elected. This procedure was first invoked when Volt himself died and <b>Deputy</b> Chief <b>Judge</b> Hershey became acting chief judge in 2121, winning the second election to chief judge in 2122. Even this rule only applies to a <b>deputy</b> chief <b>judge</b> who was appointed by an elected chief <b>judge.</b> A <b>deputy</b> chief <b>judge</b> appointed by an unelected chief judge does not become acting chief judge; instead there must be an election.|$|R
500|$|Most of Stevenson's early {{legal work}} {{was in the}} field of insolvencies, [...] "almost always with small fees", and he made steady {{progress}} until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. He did very little criminal work in this part of his career. In 1940 he joined the army and served until 1945 as a <b>Deputy</b> <b>Judge</b> Advocate with the rank of major; he was appointed a King's Counsel in 1943. In 1945 he served as Judge Advocate at the war crimes trial in Hamburg of former personnel of the German submarine U-852, the so-called Peleus affair. The U-boat captain, Heinz-Wilhelm Eck, was accused of ordering his crew to open fire on the survivors of a Greek ship, the SS Peleus, which they had just torpedoed and sunk. Eck and two of his junior officers were executed by firing squad; he was the only U-boat commander of the war to be convicted of war crimes committed at sea.|$|E
2500|$|The court later {{sat with}} Frederick Garling as acting <b>deputy</b> <b>judge</b> {{advocate}} {{after the death}} of Bent. [...] Sir John Wylde was appointed by the British authorities in 1815 as Bent’s successor and presided in the Court until its abolition in 1823.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1951 and 1954, Hyndman {{served as}} <b>deputy</b> <b>judge</b> of the Exchequer Court of Canada.

50|$|The {{court has}} three {{full-time}} <b>judges</b> and twelve <b>deputy</b> <b>judges,</b> predominantly retired judges from other jurisdictions. The Justice of the Peace Court, {{which is also}} part of the Territorial Court, consists of one full-time judge and 32 part-time Justices of the Peace, who are not legally qualified.|$|R
2500|$|Col. Charles L. Decker, {{an acting}} <b>deputy</b> <b>judge</b> advocate, {{concluded}} in late 1945 that, while there {{had probably been}} a violation of international law, [...] "in {{the light of the}} conditions which greeted the eyes of the first combat troops, it is not believed that justice or equity demand that the difficult and perhaps impossible task of fixing individual responsibility now be undertaken".|$|E
2500|$|Anthony Fenn Kemp (1773 – 28 October 1868) was a soldier, {{merchant}} and a <b>deputy</b> <b>judge</b> {{advocate of}} the colony of New South Wales (the predecessor to the Australian State). [...] He {{was one of the}} key participants in the [...] "Rum Rebellion" [...] that removed William Bligh, the appointed governor of the colony, and established an interim military government. He was later permitted to settle in Van Diemen's Land and became a successful merchant and farmer there.|$|E
2500|$|This led, in 1803, to Kemp being {{involved}} in a pamphlet war denouncing the governor. For this, Kemp was court martialled along with two other junior officers. He was saved by Major George Johnston (who was later {{a key player in}} the Rum Rebellion). [...] Johnston ordered the arrest of John Harris, the presiding officer at Kemp's court-martial. This was for allegedly revealing the voting of two other officers in an earlier court martial. Although Harris was later exonerated, he was replaced by <b>deputy</b> <b>judge</b> advocate Richard Atkins, and Kemp was acquitted.|$|E
50|$|Formerly, <b>deputy</b> {{district}} <b>judges</b> {{could only}} be drawn from barristers and solicitors of at least seven years' standing. However, in 2004, calls for increased diversity among the judiciary were recognised and the qualification period was changed so that, as of 21 July 2008, a potential <b>deputy</b> district <b>judge</b> must satisfy the judicial-appointment eligibility condition on a 5-year basis and so that other types of lawyer, such as legal executives (ILEX Fellows), would be eligible. In August 2010 Ian Ashley-Smith became the first CILEx Fellow to be directly appointed as a <b>deputy</b> district <b>judge</b> (Civil).|$|R
50|$|It {{is led by}} a chief justice, and has 100 {{appointed}} {{professional and}} <b>deputy</b> <b>judges.</b> These are divided into eight sections. In addition, the court has 105 administrative employees, of which 30 are in central administration, 59 in judicial-related jobs and 16 in security. These are led by a managing director.|$|R
50|$|Roughly one {{in every}} hundred active {{citizens}} became electors. Electors paid taxes equal to 10 days work a year: typically 5 to 10 livres. There were about 50,000 electors in France at the time. These electors also met in assemblies where they nominated <b>deputies,</b> <b>judges,</b> and members of other departments.|$|R
2500|$|Ellis Bent, {{the first}} {{barrister}} appointed as <b>deputy</b> <b>judge</b> {{advocate for the}} colony, made recommendations to Governor Lachlan Macquarie {{for the establishment of}} new civil courts to reflect the changing nature of the society from a penal colony to a trading colony. [...] This reflected the public sentiment in New South Wales {{that it was time for}} a legally qualified judge to head a superior court in the colony, rather than a military officer who happened to have legal qualifications. [...] Macquarie supported this and eventually the British authorities arranged for new charters to issue for the reform of the civil courts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{court was}} created by the First Charter of Justice, issued by King George III in the form of letters patent dated 2 April 1787. The Court of Civil Jurisdiction as {{established}} by the Charter was composed of the <b>Deputy</b> <b>Judge</b> Advocate of New South Wales, who was commonly known in the colony as the “judge-advocate”, and two other persons appointed to the court by the Governor of New South Wales. The judge-advocate was the presiding officer. [...] The court had jurisdiction to hear and determine summarily actions relating to land, houses, debt, contract, trespass, and most other common law or equitable cases of any amount.|$|E
2500|$|Kemp {{returned}} to Sydney in 1807, {{where he was}} {{to play an important}} part in 1808 in the rebellion against Governor William Bligh. On 25 January, Kemp was the senior military officer on the Court of Criminal Jurisdiction, which had been called to try John Macarthur for the charge of sedition. Kemp was second most senior member of the bench; the senior member was the <b>deputy</b> <b>judge</b> advocate Atkins. [...] Atkins was a drunk and also owed Macarthur and others great deals of money. At the trial, Macarthur with 'a great torrent of threats and abusive language' alleged that Atkins was unfit for the bench.|$|E
