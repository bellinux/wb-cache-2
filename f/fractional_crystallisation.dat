Alkarb contained 21% rubidium while the rest was potassium and {{a small fraction of}} caesium. Today the largest producers of caesium, for example the Tanco Mine in Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as by-product from pollucite. Today, a common method for separating rubidium from potassium and caesium is the <b>fractional</b> <b>crystallisation</b> of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O, which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately 30 recrystallisations. The limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limit the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. Caesium, however, is not produced from the above reaction. Instead, the mining of pollucite ore is the main method of obtaining pure caesium, extracted from the ore mainly by three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction. Both metals are produced as by-products of lithium production: after 1958, when interest in lithium's thermonuclear properties increased sharply, the production of rubidium and caesium also increased correspondingly. Pure rubidium and caesium metals are produced by reducing their chlorides with calcium metal at 750°C and low pressure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Numerical {{thermodynamic}} modelling of min-eral {{composition and}} modes for specified pressure-tem-perature paths reveals the strong influence of <b>fractional</b> garnet <b>crystallisation,</b> {{as well as}} water fractionation, on garnet growth histories in high pressure rocks. Dis-equilibrium element incorporation in garnet due {{to the development of}} chemical inhomogeneities around por-phyroblasts leads to pronounced episodic growth and may even cause growth interruptions. Discontinuous growth, together with pressure- and temperature-dependent changes in garnet chemistry, cause zonation patterns that are indicative of different degrees of dis-equilibrium element incorporation. Chemical inhomo-geneities in the matrix surrounding garnet porphyroblasts strongly affect garnet growth and lead to compositional discontinuities and steep compositional gradients in the garnet zonation pattern. Further, in-tergranular diffusion-controlled calcium incorporation can lead to a characteristic rise in grossular and spes-sartine contents at lower metamorphic conditions. The observation that garnet zonation patterns diagnostic of large and small fractionation effects coexist within the same sample suggests that garnet growth is often con-trolled by small-scale variations in the bulk rock chem-istry. Therefore, the spatial distribution of garnet grains and their zonation patterns, together with numerical growth models of garnet zonation patterns, yield infor-mation about the processes limiting garnet growth. These processes include intercrystalline element trans-port and dissolution of pre-existing grains. Discontinu-ities in garnet growth induced by limited element supply can mask traces of the thermobarometric history of the rock. Therefore, thermodynamic modelling that con-siders <b>fractional</b> disequilibrium <b>crystallisation</b> is re-quired to interpret compositional garnet zonation in terms of a quantitative pressure and temperature path of the host rock...|$|R

At Curie's lab, Gleditsch performed a technique called <b>fractional</b> <b>crystallisations,</b> which purified radium. The work, which was highly specialized and few could complete, allowed her laboratory fees to be waived. She spent five years of analysis with Curie and returned even after leaving the lab to supervise experiments. In 1911, she received a [...] "Licenciée en sciences degree" [...] from the Sorbonne and was awarded a teaching post at University of Oslo. After working one year, she won the first scholarship ever given to a woman from the American-Scandinavian Association to study in the United States, but was turned down by both of the schools at which she applied. She went anyway and despite having been rejected was able to work at the laboratory of Bertram Boltwood at Yale University, where she measured the half-life of radium, creating a standard measurement that was used for many years. One of the scientists who had originally turned her away from Yale, co-authored two articles with her and in June 1914, Smith College awarded her an honorary doctorate for her work. In 1913-14, she returned to the University of Oslo and became the second woman to be elected to Oslo‘s Academy of Science in 1917. During the 1920s, Gleditsch made several trips to France to assist Curie, as well as a trip to Cornwall to investigate a mine located there.|$|R
25|$|As magma cools, {{minerals}} typically crystallize {{from the}} melt at different temperatures (fractional crystallization). As minerals crystallize, {{the composition of}} the residual melt typically changes. If crystals separate from the melt, then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma. For instance, a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma. Gabbro may have a liquidus temperature near 1,200°C, and the derivative granite-composition melt may have a liquidus temperature as low as about 700°C. Incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization and in the first melts produced during partial melting: either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite, a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements. Bowen's reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of <b>fractional</b> <b>crystallisation</b> of a magma.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} {{extraction}} of radium Curie used the residues after extraction of uranium from pitchblende. The uranium had been extracted by dissolution in sulfuric acid leaving radium sulfate, {{which is similar}} to barium sulfate but even less soluble in the residues. The residues also contained rather substantial amounts of barium sulfate which thus acted as a carrier for the radium sulfate. The first steps of the radium extraction process involved boiling with sodium hydroxide followed by hydrochloric acid treatment to remove as much as possible of other compounds. The remaining residue was then treated with sodium carbonate to convert the barium sulfate into barium carbonate carrying the radium, thus making it soluble in hydrochloric acid. After dissolution the barium and radium are reprecipitated as sulfates and this was repeated one or few times, for further purification of the mixed sulfate. Some impurities, that form insoluble sulfides, were removed by treating the chloride solution with hydrogen sulfide followed by filtering. When the mixed sulfate were pure enough they were once more converted to mixed chloride and barium and radium were separated by <b>fractional</b> <b>crystallisation</b> while monitoring the progress using a spectroscope (radium gives characteristic red lines in contrast to the green barium lines), and the electroscope.|$|E
500|$|Iodine monofluoride (IF) is {{unstable}} at {{room temperature}} and disproportionates very readily and irreversibly to iodine and iodine pentafluoride, and thus cannot be obtained pure. It can be synthesised from the reaction of iodine with fluorine gas in trichlorofluoromethane at −45°C, with iodine trifluoride in trichlorofluoromethane at −78°C, or with silver(I) fluoride at 0°C. Iodine monochloride (ICl) and iodine monobromide (IBr), on the other hand, are moderately stable. The former, a volatile red-brown compound, was discovered independently by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Humphry Davy in 1813–4 {{not long after the}} discoveries of chlorine and iodine, and it mimics the intermediate halogen bromine so well that Justus von Liebig was misled into mistaking bromine (which he had found) for iodine monochloride. Iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide may be prepared simply by reacting iodine with chlorine or bromine {{at room temperature}} and purified by <b>fractional</b> <b>crystallisation.</b> Both are quite reactive and attack even platinum and gold, though not boron, carbon, cadmium, lead, zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, and tungsten. Their reaction with organic compounds depends on conditions. Iodine chloride vapour tends to chlorinate phenol and salicyclic acid, since when iodine chloride undergoes homolytic dissociation, chlorine and iodine are produced and the former is more reactive. However, iodine chloride in tetrachloromethane solution results in iodination being the main reaction, since now heterolytic fission of the I–Cl bond occurs and I+ attacks phenol as an electrophile. However, iodine monobromide tends to brominate phenol even in tetrachloromethane solution because it tends to dissociate into its elements in solution, and bromine is more reactive than iodine. When liquid, iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide dissociate into [...] and [...] anions (X = Cl, Br); thus they are significant conductors of electricity and can be used as ionising solvents.|$|E
40|$|Enantiomer {{separation}} {{remains an}} important technique for obtaining optically active materials. Even though the enantiomers have identical physical properties, {{the difference in}} their biological activities make it important to separate them, {{in order to use}} single enantiomer products in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. In this project, the separations of three pairs of diastereomer salts (Fig 1) by crystallisation are studied, as examples of the ‘classical’ resolution of enantiomers via conversion to diastereomers. The lattice energies of these diastereomer compounds are calculated computationally (based on realistic potentials for the dominant electrostatic interactions and ab initio conformational energies). Then the experimental data are compared with the theoretical data to study the efficiency of the resolving agent. All three <b>fractional</b> <b>crystallisations</b> occurred relatively slowly, and appeared to be thermodynamically controlled. Separabilities by crystallisation have been compared with measured phase equilibrium data for the three systems studied. All crystallisations appear to be consistent with ternary phase diagrams. In the case of R = CH 3, where the salt-solvent ternaries exhibited eutonic behaviour, the direction of isomeric enrichment changed abruptly on passing through the eutonic composition. In another example, R = OH, the ternaries indicated near-ideal solubility behaviour of the salt mixtures, and the separation by crystallisation again corresponded. Further, new polymorphic structures and generally better structure predictions have been obtained through out this study. In the case of R = CH 3, an improved structure of the p-salt has been determined. In the case of R = C 2 H 5, new polymorphic forms of the n-salts, II and III, have been both discovered and predicted. This work also demonstrates that chemically related organic molecules can exhibit different patterns of the relative energies of the theoretical low energy crystal structures, along with differences in the experimental polymorphic behaviour. This joint experimental and computational investigation provides a stringent test of the reliability of lattice modelling to explain the origins of chiral resolution via diastereomer formation.
