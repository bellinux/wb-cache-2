5|$|Although Hasekura's embassy was cordially {{received}} in Spain and Rome, it <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> {{a time when}} Japan was moving toward the suppression of Christianity. European monarchs such as the King of Spain thus refused the trade agreements Hasekura had been seeking. Hasekura returned to Japan in 1620 and died of illness a year later, his embassy seemingly ending with few results in an increasingly isolationist Japan.|$|E

During this, the Australian Defence Force pilots were given permission to destroy any hostile aircraft.

5|$|In 1997, the Manzanar At Dusk program {{became a}} part of the Pilgrimage. The program attracts local area residents, as well as {{descendants}} of Manzanar's ranch days and the town of Manzanar. Through small group discussions, the event gives participants the opportunity to hear directly about the experiences of former incarcerees first-hand, to share their experiences and feelings about what they learned, and talk about the relevance of what <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> Manzanar to their own lives.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probably}} worth noting, {{if only to}} avoid confusion, that such claims (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were unable to explain the phenomena) were often unfounded. For example, spiritualists claimed that Robert-Houdin {{had been unable to}} explain what <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> a Home seance, and critics claimed that Home had refused an invitation to perform in front of Robert-Houdin. There is, however, not a shred of evidence for either of these claims.|$|E

He denies this and tells her that he is in love with her, but she insists that her actions were not personal.|$|E

5|$|On 15 September 1881, a {{light engine}} and a coal train {{collided}} {{near the mouth}} of Copenhagen Tunnel north of the station because of a signalman's error. One person was killed and another was severely injured. Bad weather contributed to flooding in the tunnels. One such incident in July 1901 suspended all traffic from the station for more than four hours, which <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> no other London terminus.|$|E

5|$|The {{incident}} <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> the campus's Cole Hall {{at approximately}} 3:05p.m. Central Standard Time. The school placed the campus on lockdown; {{students and teachers}} were advised to head to a secure location, take cover, and avoid the scene and all buildings {{in the vicinity of}} the area. Six people died in the incident, including the perpetrator, tying it with the University of Iowa shooting as the fifth-deadliest university shooting in United States history.|$|E
5|$|The shootdown <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> a {{very tense}} time in U.S.–Soviet {{relations}} during the Cold War. The U.S. adopted {{a strategy of}} releasing {{a substantial amount of}} hitherto highly classified intelligence information in order to exploit a major propaganda advantage over the Soviet Union. Six hours after the plane was downed, the South Korean government issued an announcement that the plane had merely been forced to land abruptly by the Soviets, and that all passengers and crew were safe.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} what <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> Salon Kitty first came to light in Walter Schellenberg's memoirs, {{published}} in Germany in 1956 under the title The Labyrinth.

5|$|Arsenal {{qualified}} for the final by defeating French club Lens in their semi-final. Galatasaray beat English team Leeds United but their matches were marred by violence: two Leeds United fans were stabbed to death before their semi-final first leg at Galatasaray's Ali Sami Yen Stadium in Istanbul on 6 April 2000. The events <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> 22:00 in Istanbul's Taksim Square during a fight between Leeds fans and Galatasaray fans. Leeds fans had been drinking in bars reportedly taunting local people and Turkish police intervened to stop fights breaking out. There were reports that a Galatasaray fan had run to a telephone to call for support when he saw Leeds fans arriving. Galatasaray fans entered the area shortly afterwards which precipitated a fight between {{the two sets of}} supporters. This led to the two Leeds fans being stabbed.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{election}} of a former royal clerk as Pope Clement V in 1305, the king was able to secure the archbishop's exile that same year. Upon the succession of Edward's son, Edward II, Winchelsey was allowed to return to England after the new king petitioned the pope to allow his return. Winchelsey soon joined the king's enemies, however, and was the only bishop to object to the return of the king's favourite, Piers Gaveston. Winchelsey died in 1313. Although miracles were alleged to have <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> his tomb, an attempt to have him declared a saint was unsuccessful.|$|E

Enewetak Atoll was chosen as the test site on 11 October. The island was remote, but with a good harbor and an airstrip. It also had ocean currents and trade winds that would carry fallout out to sea, an important consideration in view of what had <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> Bikini Atoll during Operation Crossroads.|$|E

They are interrupted by the lookout's horn as Sansa Stark, Brienne of Tarth, and Podrick Payne arrive at Castle Black and Sansa is reunited with Jon. After telling each other their stories, Sansa tries to convince Jon to help her retake Winterfell. However, Jon is still reluctant to fight. Frustrated, Sansa declares to Jon that she will take back Winterfell whether he helps her or not.|$|E
5|$|Peel {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for trying new methods within the industry, {{being one of the}} first textile manufacturers to use carding cylinders. He began experimenting at his home with different forms of printing until, according to family tradition, his young daughter Anne brought him a sprig of parsley and begged him {{to use it as a}} pattern. He etched this design onto a pewter plate to allow the printing, which was then finished with an iron by one of the women of the household. There are other versions of the tale, which dispute whether the experiments <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> the farm at Peel Fold or his house in Fish Lane and suggest a poor neighbour, Mrs. Milton, calendered the cloth to finish it.|$|E
5|$|Sunset Overdrive {{was among}} {{one of the}} first Xbox One exclusives {{revealed}} at Microsoft's press conference at E3 2013. The first gameplay details were revealed by gaming magazine Edge in May 2014. A gameplay demo and a release date announcement <b>happened</b> <b>at</b> E3 2014. Insomniac had worked solely for the PlayStation family for about twenty years, and the announcement of Sunset Overdrive being an Xbox exclusive led to speculation that the relationship between Sony and Insomniac had ended. Insomniac denied such rumors, saying the company would still be working with other publishers to produce titles and that petitions would not change Sunset Overdrives status as an Xbox exclusive. It was released on October 28, 2014.|$|E
