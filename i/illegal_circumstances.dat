50|$|Abortion in Israel is {{permitted}} in most cases.

Prior to 2014, however, approval for an abortion in Israel by a termination committee was given under more limited circumstances, such as if the woman is unmarried, because of age (if the woman is under the age of 18 - the legal marriage age in Israel - or over the age 40), the pregnancy was conceived under <b>illegal</b> <b>circumstances</b> (rape, statutory rape, etc.) or an incestuous relationship, birth defects, risk of health to the mother, and life of the mother.

25|$|Chile {{has some}} of the strictest {{abortion}} laws in the world. One of the last acts of the military government under Pinochet was to outlaw abortion in all circumstances. Chile's abortion law criminalizes abortion even when it would save a pregnant woman's life. Therapeutic abortion was legal between 1931 and 1989 but is now is <b>illegal</b> under all <b>circumstances.</b> There have been proposed bills from Chilean legislators and s on abortion and reproductive rights, but they have never been passed. Estimates range between 120,000 and 160,000 for the number of Chilean women who have illegal abortions each year. Chile is considered to have one of the highest abortion rates in Latin America. Every year, nearly 40,000 teenage girls become pregnant.

5000|$|The unusual {{dimensions}} of Gronen's margins of victory and heat times tipped off derby officials to <b>illegal</b> <b>circumstances</b> surrounding Gronen's racer. Subsequent X-ray examination {{of his car}} revealed an electromagnet in the nose. When activated at the starting line, the electromagnet pulled the car forward by attracting it to the steel paddle used to start the race. Gronen activated the electromagnet by leaning his helmet against the backrest of his seat, which activated its power source. This became very evident as Gronen's heat times progressively slowed down as the race wore on, because the electromagnet lost strength each time it was activated. Usually, heat times get faster each time a racer completes a heat. Videotape of the race also showed a suspiciously sudden lead for Gronen {{just a few feet}} after each heat began. The margin of victory for a race heat is normally no more than 1 to 3 ft. Gronen's early heat victories were in the 20 to 30 ft range. (Aluminum insulator plates were added to the starting ramps in 1974 to render an electromagnetic system useless.) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Abortion {{laws are}} {{extremely}} restrictive in Brazil. The knowledge, opinions of abortion laws, and abortion practices of obstetrician-gynecologists {{can have a}} significant impact on women's access to safe abortion. Methods We conducted a mail-in survey with a 10 % random sample of obstetrician-gynecologists affiliated with the Brazilian Federation of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. We documented participants' experiences performing abortion under a range of legal and <b>illegal</b> <b>circumstances,</b> and asked about which abortion techniques they had experience with. We used chi-square tests and crude logistic regression models to determine which sociodemographic, knowledge-related, or practice-related variables were associated with physician opinion. Results Of the 1, 500 questionnaires that we mailed out, we received responses from 572 (38 %). Less than half (48 %) of the respondents reported accurate knowledge about abortion law and 77 % thought that the law should be more liberal. One-third of respondents reported having previous experience performing an abortion, and very few of these physicians reported having experience with manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) or with misoprostol with either mifepristone or methotrexate. Physicians that favored liberalization of the law were more likely to have correct knowledge about abortion law, and to be in favor of public funding for abortion services. Conclusion Brazilian obstetrician-gynecologists need more information on abortion laws and on safe, effective abortion procedures. </p...|$|E
