25|$|The symphony {{begins with}} a soft roll on the timpani {{followed}} by a slow ascending syncopated C major scale (starting on the timpani's G) in the strings which leads to an unexpected chord in the remote key of A minor.

In 1966 Whitman unexpectedly killed his mother as well as wife, ascended the belltower of the University of Texas, Austin, and fired a rifle at students below. He killed 15 people and wounding 31 more before police officers shot him. Whitman in his <b>final</b> <b>note</b> complained of inability to control his thoughts and requested an autopsy, which revealed a brain tumor in the hypothalamus region of his brain, a growth that, some hypothesized, put pressure on his amygdala.|$|E

The event culminated with the United States Air Force Honor Guard presenting the American Flag to the family - which coincided with a three element fly-over. The lead element featured a Rockwell Sabreliner similar to that which Hoover flew during airshows, along with two F-16s from the USAF Thunderbirds and a CT-114 from the Canadian Forces Snowbirds. The second element featured the USAF Heritage Flight with an F-22 Raptor and two F-86 Sabres, and {{the third and final}} installment featured a four-ship World War II warbird flight, with the P-51 Ole' Yeller pulling up in the missing man formation on the <b>final</b> <b>note</b> of Taps.|$|E

500|$|Joplin {{combines}} the waltz' [...] "oom-pa-pah" [...] rhythm and its conventionally accented three quarter {{notes in the}} bass, with a syncopated melody in the treble. The main melody line used in the introduction and then repeated regularly throughout, with its alternate unaccented eighth notes and accented quarter notes, is {{the rhythm of the}} Cakewalk minus the <b>final</b> <b>note.</b> The Cakewalk was a popular African-American dance which originated in plantation slave communities in nineteenth century America, and ultimately contributed to the musical style Ragtime. [...] The simultaneous sounding of the two independent rhythms, he combination of the waltz in the bass and the syncopation of the main theme in the treble, {{is an example of a}} 4 against 3 polyrhythm. There are many subtle variations of this sequence which occur throughout the work.|$|E
500|$|Using a five- to eight-note range, Orbison's voice rises as {{he wakes}} up to find his lover gone.

The song never repeats a section. In two minutes and forty-eight seconds, it goes through seven movements with distinct melodies and chord progressions. The first two sections are sixteen bars each; the rest are only eight bars. In comparison to the standard form of pop songs in AABA — where A represents a standard verse, and B represents a variation, usually {{referred to as the}} bridge — [...] "In Dreams", with each variation, can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F.|$|E

(Holy), in {{contrast}} with other compositions of mass and Requiem where it is often illustrated with great vocal and instrumental forces (particularly Verdi's Requiem), is here expressed in extremely simple form. The sopranos sing softly in a very simple rising and falling melody of only three notes, which the male voices repeat, accompanied by arpeggios on the harp and a dreamy rising melody in the violins (sometimes just a solo violin). The pattern appears several times, with the melodies increasing in ambitus, and the volume reaching forte on [...] "" [...] (the highest).

The title theme was written by Barry and Leslie Bricusse; the song was originally recorded by Shirley Bassey, and later rerecorded by Dionne Warwick, whose version was not released until the 1990s. The song {{was removed from the}} title credits after producers Albert R.

Barry then teamed up with lyricist Don Black and wrote [...] "Thunderball", which was sung by Tom Jones, who according to Bond production legend, fainted in the recording booth when singing the song's <b>final</b> <b>note.</b> Jones said of it, [...] "I closed my eyes and I held the note for so long when I opened my eyes the room was spinning." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{choosing}} an [...] "English" [...] over a Classical setting, Gray provided {{a model for}} later poets wishing to describe England and the English countryside {{during the second half}} of the 18th century. [...] Once Gray had set the example, any occasion would do to give a sense of the effects of time in a landscape, as for instance in the passage of the seasons as described in John Scott’s Four Elegies, descriptive and moral (1757). Other imitations, though avoiding overt verbal parallels, chose similar backgrounds to signal their parentage. One favourite theme was a meditation among ruins, such as John Langhorne's “Written among the ruins of Pontefract Castle” (1756), Edward Moore’s “An elegy, written among the ruins of a nobleman's seat in Cornwall” (1756) and John Cunningham’s “An elegy on a pile of ruins" [...] (1761). Gray’s friend William Mason chose an actual churchyard in South Wales for his “Elegy VI” (1787), adding a reference to the poet in the text. He also provided a <b>final</b> <b>note</b> explaining that the poem was written “to make it appear a day scene, and as such to contrast it with the twilight scene of my excellent Friend’s Elegy”.|$|E
