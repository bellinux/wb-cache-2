The man behind her, however, was asked to step inside a large circular tube, raise his hands above his head, and have his whole body scanned. If you have ever witnessed a full-body scan at the airport, you may have witnessed terahertz imaging. Terahertz wavelengths are located between microwave and infrared on the electromagnetic spectrum. When exposed to these wavelengths, certain materials such as clothing, thin metal, sheet rock, and insulation become transparent. At airports, terahertz radiation can illuminate guns, knives, or explosives hidden underneath a passenger s clothing. At NASA s Kennedy Space Center, terahertz wavelengths have assisted in the inspection of materials like insulating foam on the external tanks of the now-retired space shuttle. "The foam we used on the external tank was a little denser than Styrofoam, but not much," says Robert Youngquist, a physicist at Kennedy.

The mechanical properties of cosmeses materials suggested that the foams would not fail at the strain levels measured when undamaged. However, when the foam became cracked {{the properties of the}} foams were reduced to a level that would make failure likely to occur when the cracks reached critical lengths. The failure mechanism of the <b>foam</b> <b>coverings</b> was established via the use of a test rig, designed and built to simulate the interaction between the artificial limb patella piece and the foam. Foam samples were tested both with and without protective elastic netting. The primary cause of failure was found to be wear induced cracking. It was recommended that the design of the patella piece should be changed so as to be less damaging, and that netting should be used for all foams. Silicone foam materials were formulated and investigated for their suitability as a cosmesis foam. Silicone foam samples were tested on the fatigue test rig. Skinned silicone foams with netting had lifetimes three times that of any cosmesis foam tested in a condition currently used in production procedure, and 35 % longer than any foam tested in any condition.

The e mployed sensors in the mat are activated based on a resistive measuring principle so that a chara cteristic activation of sensors for particular “classes of occupants “ can be achieved.

40|$|In an {{experimental}} study to obtain detailed heating data over the Space Shuttle Orbiter, CUBRC has completed an extensive matrix of experiments using three distinct models and two unique hypervelocity wind tunnel facilities. This detailed {{data will be}} employed to assess heating augmentation due to boundary layer transition on the Orbiter wing leading edge and wind side acreage with comparisons to computational methods and flight data obtained during the Orbiter Entry Boundary Layer Flight Experiment and HYTHIRM during STS- 119 reentry. These comparisons will facilitate critical updates {{to be made to}} the engineering tools employed to make assessments about natural and tripped boundary layer transition during Orbiter reentry. To achieve the goals of this study data was obtained over a range of Mach numbers from 10 to 18, with flight scaled Reynolds numbers and model attitudes representing key points on the Orbiter reentry trajectory. The first of these studies were performed {{as an integral part of}} Return to Flight activities following the accident that occurred during the reentry of the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS- 107) in February of 2003. This accident was caused by debris, which originated from the <b>foam</b> <b>covering</b> the external tank bipod fitting ramps, striking and damaging critical wing leading edge heating tiles that reside in the Orbiter bow shock/wing interaction region. During investigation of the accident aeroheating team members discovered that only a limited amount of experimental wing leading edge data existed in this critical peak heating area and a need arose to acquire a detailed dataset of heating in this region. This new dataset was acquired in three phases consisting of a risk mitigation phase employing a 1. 8 % scale Orbiter model with special temperature sensitive paint covering the wing leading edge, a 0. 9 % scale Orbiter model with high resolution thin-film instrumentation in the span direction, and the primary 1. 8 % scale Orbiter model with detailed thin-film resolution in both the span and chord direction in the area of peak heating. Additional objectives of this first study included: obtaining natural or tripped turbulent wing leading edge heating levels, assessing the effectiveness of protuberances and cavities placed at specified locations on the orbiter over a range of Mach numbers and Reynolds numbers to evaluate and compare to existing engineering and computational tools, obtaining cavity floor heating to aid in the verification of cavity heating correlations, acquiring control surface deflection heating data on both the main body flap and elevons, and obtain high speed schlieren videos of the interaction of the orbiter nose bow shock with the wing leading edge. To support these objectives, the stainless steel 1. 8 % scale orbiter model in addition to the sensors on the wing leading edge was instrumented down the windward centerline, over the wing acreage on the port side, and painted with temperature sensitive paint on the starboard side wing acreage. In all, the stainless steel 1. 8 % scale Orbiter model was instrumented with over three-hundred highly sensitive thin-film heating sensors, two-hundred of which were located in the wing leading edge shock interaction region. Further experimental studies will also be performed following the successful acquisition of flight data during the Orbiter Entry Boundary Layer Flight Experiment and HYTHIRM on STS- 119 at specific data points simulating flight conditions and geometries. Additional instrumentation and a protuberance matching the layout present during the STS- 119 boundary layer transition flight experiment were added with testing performed at Mach number and Reynolds number conditions simulating conditions experienced in flight. In addition to the experimental studies, CUBRC also performed a large amount of CFD analysis to confirm and validate not only the tunnel freestream conditions, but also 3 D flows over the orbiter acreage, wing leading edge, and controlurfaces to assess data quality, shock interaction locations, and control surface separation regions. This analysis is a standard part of any experimental program at CUBRC, and this information was of key importance for post-test data quality analysis and understanding particular phenomena seen in the data.

Two sets of measurements were performed, one for the unmodified rough-surface SOFI panel and another for a panel whose surface was sanded down to produce a smooth surface interface with the ice cover. The latter was used to evaluate the results of radiative transfer calculations which are much easier to perform for multilayer structures with plane boundaries. We present experimental evidence demonstrating that the technique developed can accurately predict ice thickness in the case of the smooth-surface SOFI panel. For the original (rough-surface) panel, the emission levels observed were considerably higher than predicted by the model.

The first heat exchanger, HX 1, has the core tube made of S 316 stainless steel with the tube {{external and internal}} diameters measure 32. 0 mm and 28. 3 mm, respectively. The foam layer of HX 1 is bonded to its core tube using highly conductive thermal glue. The second heat exchanger, HX 2, has the core tube made of AA 6061, the same material as the <b>foam</b> layer <b>covering</b> it, and the two parts are bonded together by a brazing technique. The core tube of HX 2 has nearly identical dimension to that of HX 1 with a small variation in its thickness. The tests are carried out on each heat exchanger, installed horizontally in a cross-flow arrangement inside a wind tunnel, {{one at a time}} with air velocity varying between 1. 5 to 5 m/s. Heat transfer from 75 C hot liquid, circulating through the core tube, to external air is evaluated using the concept of total thermal resistance where the effects of tube material and the two bonding methods are quantified as a series of smaller resistant components. The results show that, within the range of designated air velocity, thermal contact resistance (TCR) of HX 1 is 0. 015 ± 0. 001 K/W larger than that of HX 2; essentially constant with the air flow rate. This TCR however contributes between 10 % to 19 % of HX 1 total thermal resistance from lowest to highest air velocity, respectively.

40|$|We {{formulate}} a new unit-cell model of elastic open-cell foams. In this model, the conventional skeleton of open-cell foams is supplemented by fitting a thin-walled bubble within each cavity of the skeleton, {{as a substitute}} for the membranes that occlude the openings of the skeleton in elastic polyether polyurethane foams. The model has 9 parameters, and the value of each parameter may be readily estimated for any given foam. We implement the model as a user-defined material subroutine in the finite-element code ABAQUS. To calibrate the model, we carry out fully nonlinear, three-dimensional finite-element computational simulations of the experiments of Dai et al., in which a set of five polyether-polyurethane EOC <b>foams</b> <b>covering</b> the entire range of commercially available relative densities was tested under five loading conditions: compression along the rise direction, compression along a transverse direction, tension along the rise direction, simple shear combined with compression along the rise direction, and hydrostatic pressure combined with compression along the rise direction. We show that, with a suitable choice of the values of the parameters of the model, the model is capable of reproducing the most salient trends evinced in the experimental stress-strain curves. We also show that the model can no longer reproduce all of these trends if the bubbles be excluded from the model, and conclude that the bubbles play a crucial role at large deformations, at least under certain loading conditions. Next, we turn our attention to the stretch fields. Of special interest to us are the two-phase stretch fields associated with a phase transition. These fields consist of mixtures of two configurational phases of the foam, a high-deformation phase and a low-deformation phase. We show that the stretch fields that obtain in our computational simulations are in good accord with the digital-image-correlation measurements of Dai et al., except for simple shear combined with compression along the rise direction. For this loading condition, Dai et al. concluded that the stretch fields remained continuous and {{there was no evidence of}} distinct configurational phases in the foam. And yet, Dai et al. might have concluded otherwise had they probed the stretch fields close to the lateral faces of the specimen, where according to our computational simulations they would have found circumscribed nuclei of the high-deformation phase. To settle the matter, we subject a foam specimen to simple shear combined with compression along the rise direction, measure the stretch fields via a digital-image-correlation technique, and find discontinuities in the stretch fields [...] but only close to the lateral faces of the specimen, just as expected on the basis of our computational simulations. All of the major features of the stretch fields turn out to be well reproduced in the computational simulations. In the last part of this thesis, we assess the capacity of the new model to yield reliable predictions of the mechanical response of foams under punching, a common type of loading in applications of elastic polyether polyurethane foams. In punching problems the geometry is complex, the stress fields are highly spatially heterogeneous, the deformations are very large, and the use of finite-element simulations is indispensable. We have recourse to data from numerous punching experiments in which tall and short specimens of foams of three low values of relative density were penetrated by a wedge-shaped punch and a conical punch. For each experiment we run a fully nonlinear, three-dimensional finite-element computational simulation and find the simulated force [...] penetration curve to be in good accord with the corresponding experimental force [...] penetration curve. Wedge-shaped punches and conical punches lack an intrinsic characteristic length, a fact that has been exploited to carry out a simple but powerful theoretical analysis of the mechanical response of foams under punching. Some of the assumptions and simplifications of this theoretical analysis have remained inaccessible to direct experimental verification, and we use our computational simulations to show that these assumptions and simplifications are justified. Our results on punching serve to underscore the importance of phase transitions in the mechanics of EOC foams. The force-penetration curves display a number of striking features, and we can relate each one of these features to the presence of two configurational phases in the foam. Feature by feature the relation is so specific and intricate that we are lead to conclude that the force-penetration curves could be taken by themselves as proof of the occurrence of phase transitions, even in the absence of any direct experimental evidence of the stretch fields. A number of models of EOC foams might not allow for the occurrence of phase transitions and still be able to account for numerous stress-stretch curves measured under compression along the rise direction, for example. But the force-penetration curves are inextricably linked to the prevalence of two-phase stretch fields, and it is likely that no model can account for these curves unless it allows for the occurrence of phase transitions...|$|R
40|$|This Research Project {{evaluates the}} {{combustion}} severity of New Zealand upholstered furniture materials. Experimental combustion tests on typical upholstered furniture fabric and polyurethane foam combinations {{form the basis}} for all conclusions reached. 63 bench-scale Cone Calorimeter and 10 full-scale armchair Furniture Calorimeter combustion tests were conducted in the Fire Engineering Laboratory at the University of Canterbury. 7 different polyurethane foams, including 2 fire-retardant, are tested along with 100 % polypropylene and 95 % woollen fabrics. These tests demonstrate that the variation of <b>foam</b> and fabric <b>covering</b> play a substantial role in influencing the combustion characteristics. Between the wool and polypropylene fabric types, there were several combustion behavioural differences identified. Most significantly was the ability of the woollen fabric to remain in place under intense heat exposure for a longer time than the polypropylene. This had the effect of prolonging the ignition times in the Cone Calorimeter tests and increasing the time to peak heat release rates (HRRs) for both the Cone and Furniture Calorimeter tests. The effects of the various types of polyurethane foam were generally less significant than the effects caused by varying the fabric type. However, one type of fire retardant foam showed combustion characteristics that were significantly out of pattern from the others, by having prolonged ignition times and longer times to peak HRRs in the Cone and Furniture Calorimeter tests respectively. Thus the effects of the fire retardant foam was clearly shown to interfere with the combustion behaviour. All experimental methods in this Research Project follow the methods developed by the European fire research programme CBUF- Combustion Behaviour of Upholstered furniture. Thus, the results in this Research Project are meaningful on an international level. Model I, a method for predicting full-scale burning combustion characteristics from bench-scale test data, as developed by the European CBUF research, is applied to the New Zealand materials. The full-scale furniture combustion Model is compared in three areas, which are the value of peak HRR (kW), time to peak HRR (s) and the total amount of heat released (MJ), from burning full-scale armchairs. The Model does not accurately predict the full-scale burning characteristics, especially for the predicted time to peak HRR and total heat released. Instead the Model is conservative from a design perspective, predicting the time to peak HRR in a shorter time and a higher total heat release. For the peak HRR prediction, the Model achieves a level of confidence comparable with the European data that was used to validate the Model. Therefore it is considered accurate enough to be used to predict the peak HRR for the selected full-scale armchair style, without doing full-scale tests...|$|R
40|$|Sandwich panels {{comprise}} a thick, light-weight plastic foam such as polyurethane, polystyrene or mineral wool sandwiched between two relatively thin steel faces. One or both steel faces may be flat, lightly profiled or fully profiled. Until recently sandwich panel construction in Australia {{has been limited}} to cold-storage buildings {{due to the lack}} of design methods and data. However, in recent times, its use has increased significantly due to their widespread structural applications in building systems. Structural sandwich panels generally used in Australia comprise of polystyrene foam core and thinner (0. 42 mm) and high strength (minimum yield stress of 550 MPa and reduced ductility) steel faces bonded together using separate adhesives. Sandwich panels exhibit various types of buckling behaviour depending on the types of faces used. Three types of buckling modes can be observed which are local buckling of plate elements of fully profiled faces, flexural wrinkling of flat and lightly profiled faces and mixed mode buckling of lightly profiled faces due to the interaction of local buckling and flexural wrinkling. To study the structural performance and develop appropriate design rules for sandwich panels, all these buckling failure modes have to be investigated thoroughly. A well established analytical solution exists for the design of flat faced sandwich panels, however, the design solutions for local buckling of fully profiled sandwich panels and mixed mode buckling of lightly profiled sandwich panels are not adequate. Therefore an extensive research program was undertaken to investigate the local buckling behaviour of fully profiled sandwich panels and the mixed mode buckling behaviour of lightly profiled sandwich panels. The first phase of this research was based on a series of laboratory experiments and numerical analyses of 50 foam-supported steel plate elements to study the local buckling behaviour of fully profiled sandwich panels made of thin steel faces and polystyrene <b>foam</b> core <b>covering</b> a wide range of b/t ratios. The current European design standard recommends the use of a modified effective width approach to include the local buckling effects in design. However, the experimental and numerical results revealed that this design method can predict reasonable strength for sandwich panels with low b/t ratios (< 100), but it predicts unconservative strengths for panels with slender plates (high b/t ratios). The use of sandwich panels with high b/t ratios is very common in practical design due to the increasing use of thinner and high strength steel plates. Therefore an improved design rule was developed based on the numerical results that can be used for fully profiled sandwich panels with any practical b/t ratio up to 600. The new improved design rule was validated using six full-scale experiments of profiled sandwich panels and hence can be used to develop safe and economical design solutions. The second phase of this research was based on a series of laboratory experiments and numerical analyses on lightly profiled sandwich panels to study the mixed mode buckling behaviour due to the interaction of local buckling and flexural wrinkling. The current wrinkling formula, which is a simple modification of the methods utilized for flat panels, does not consider the possible interaction between these two buckling modes. As the rib depth and width of flat plates between the ribs increase, flat plate buckling can occur leading to the failure of the entire panel due to the interaction between local buckling and wrinkling modes. Experimental and numerical results from this research confirmed that the current wrinkling formula for lightly profiled sandwich panels based on the elastic half-space method is inadequate in its present form. Hence an improved equation was developed based on validated finite element analysis results to take into account the interaction of the two buckling modes. This new interactive buckling formula can be used to determine the true value of interactive buckling stress for safe and economical design of lightly profiled sandwich panels. This thesis presents the details of experimental investigations and finite element analyses conducted to study the local buckling behaviour of fully profiled sandwich panels and the mixed mode buckling behaviour of lightly profiled sandwich panels. It includes development and validation of suitable numerical and experimental models, and the results. Current design rules are reviewed and new improved design rules are developed based on the results from this research...|$|R
