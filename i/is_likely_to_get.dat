500|$|Douglas {{reacted to}} his deputy's arrest with anger, telling reporters that [...] "whoever is instigating the {{proceedings}} {{is asking for}} {{a great deal of}} trouble, and <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it." [...] On December 10, 1937, he wrote King to tell him that he had been invited to come to Alberta to provide advice, and asked if he would be risking arrest and deportation if he did so. King responded that as long as Douglas, unlike Powell, refrained from running afoul of the Criminal Code, he had nothing to fear.|$|E
2500|$|Dave Kehr, in the Chicago Reader, wrote, [...] "Richter {{seems to}} have invented an {{elaborate}} mythology for his hero ... but he never bothers to explicate it; the film gives you the mildly annoying sensation of being left out of a not very good private joke". In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote that Buckaroo Banzai [...] "may well {{turn out to be}} a pilot film for other theatrical features, though this one would be hard to top for pure, nutty fun". Richard Corliss, in his review for Time, wrote, [...] "its creators, Earl Mac Rauch and W.D. Richter, propel their film with such pace and farfetched style that anyone without Ph.D.s in astrophysics and pop culture <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> lost in the ganglion of story strands. One wonders if the movie is too ambitious, facetious and hip for its own box-office good". Film critic Pauline Kael wrote, [...] "I didn't find it hard to accept the uninflected, deadpan tone, and to enjoy Buckaroo Banzai for its inventiveness and the gags that bounce off other adventure movies, other comedies. The picture's sense of fun carried me along".|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor fellow!" [...] said Henri, [...] "if {{adversity}} {{will teach}} him, he <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his lesson now. Did he part quietly with you, Agatha, {{on the day}} before we started to Saumur?" ...|$|E
50|$|About 99% {{of people}} prosecuted under Operation Streamline plead guilty. According to the Washington Post, {{this is because}} those who plead guilty <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{substantially}} shorter prison terms than the theoretical maximum, whereas {{those who do not}} plead guilty <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> close <b>to</b> the maximum sentence.|$|R

6000|$|... "Of course not. I {{meet them}} just as I did you. Sometimes on the boat, {{sometimes}} in the park, sometimes on the street. I'm a pretty good judge of a man. I can tell in a minute if a fellow is one who <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> fresh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look at Sparrer {{there and}} ask {{sensible}} questions," [...] returned Pat sarcastically. [...] "Is {{a man who}} would attempt cold-blooded murder likely to come at a whistle like a good doggie? We've got to take them by surprise, or somebody <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hurt. That is why I want you boys to keep out of it. This isn't your business; it's Alec's and mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I don't {{want to see}} him {{whoever he}} is,' Marvel said, 'so if he comes across any of you again tell him you hear I've retired, or that I have drowned myself, or {{anything}} else you like, but that anyhow I ain't likely to be on any of the courses again this season. And mind, you don't know anything about where I live or where he <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> any news of me.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] said Coulthurst drily, [...] "that {{you are asking}} a good deal. More, in fact, than you <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get.</b> You insist on all that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> most of {{our money}} back," [...] {{said one of the}} Directors, [...] "it seems to me, by holding our tongues. That is the main thing." ...|$|R
60|$|October 2.--Wrote my task. Went out at one and wrought in {{the wood}} till four. I was made happy by a letter from my nephew, little Walter, {{as we used to}} call him, from his age and size, {{compared}} to those of his cousin. He has been kindly received at Bombay by the Governor Mountstuart Elphinstone, and by Sir Thomas Bradford. He is taking his ground, I think, prudently, and <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on. Already first Lieutenant of Engineers--that is well to begin with.|$|E
60|$|Sept. 5. Closing in on {{the equator}} this noon. A sailor {{explained}} to a young girl that the ship's speed is poor because we are climbing up the bulge {{toward the center of}} the globe; but that when we should once get over, at the equator, and start down-hill, we should fly. When she asked him the other day what the fore-yard was, he said it was the front yard, the open area in the front end of the ship. That man has a good deal of learning stored up, and the girl <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Afraid {{it might}} be that way. But haven't you seen by this time about how much good it does for one lone sophomore to try and run the faculty?" [...] It was the coach talking again, but the gravely nodding mandarin-like heads of Howard and Ray {{accompanied}} him. [...] "Mind you, I don't mean to disparage you personally, but you must admit that you can't hardly expect to boss everything. Just what good 'll it do to go on shouting for Frazer? Quite aside from the question of whether he <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> fired or not." ...|$|E
50|$|The Central Election Commission {{said that}} all nine {{opposition}} figures <b>were</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{less than half the}} vote total incumbent Lukashenko would get. No independent verification of the government polls were allowed.|$|R
6000|$|... "More than I <b>am</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> anywhere," [...] said Lydgate, with {{rather a}} grating sarcasm in his tone. It angered him to {{perceive}} that Rosamond's mind was wandering over impracticable wishes instead of facing possible efforts.|$|R
50|$|Stardock is {{consumer}} friendly because we're a {{bunch of}} greedy capitalists who have recognized what should be an obvious truth: If you treat people as potential customers and not potential criminals you <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> more sales.|$|R
6000|$|... "The wind keeps {{just the}} same," [...] Hawkins said. [...] "I can't {{make it more}} than {{three and a half}} knots through the water. I would give a year's pay if it would go round dead ahead of us; we should soon pick her up then. As it is, she keeps {{crawling}} away. However, we can make her out, on such a night as this, a good deal further than she <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> before morning. Besides, we shall be having the moon up soon, and as we are steering pretty nearly east, it will show her up famously.|$|E
60|$|But my fellow-traveller and I had {{different}} notions: I acknowledge his were the {{more suited to}} the end of a merchant's life: who, when he is abroad upon adventures, is wise to stick to that, as the best thing for him, which he <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the most money by. On the other hand, mine was the notion of a mad, rambling boy, that never cares to see a thing twice over. But this was not all: I had a kind of impatience upon me to be nearer home, and yet an unsettled resolution which way to go. In the interval of these consultations, my friend, who was always upon the search for business, proposed another voyage among the Spice Islands, to bring home a loading of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place, {{it will be}} as well {{that he should not}} be down there, for the fun <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> fast and furious. There is not a man in the {{regiment}} who knew his father but will be drinking the lad's health, and it were better that he should go tomorrow through the barracks and shake their hands, than that he should be among them there. You can tell them that I have taken the boy off, so that they may not think that he stayed away on his own account. We will see him fitted out. It is a matter that touches the honour of the regiment that the son of our old comrade should make a fair show in the household of the viscount." ...|$|E
5000|$|Murray remarked in April 2011 {{that he was}} not keen to hire {{young women}} in his company Glencore (Swiss-Based) because they <b>were</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married and get pregnant; he was {{subsequently}} forced to issue a [...] "humbling apology".|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] said I. [...] "They are {{the only}} things of value that we <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> from the cargo. Hail the barque {{and tell them to}} send the other quarter-boat to help us <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the stuff aboard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, sir. He {{was lying}} on his back when I left him. I should think some of the others must have seen him after I did. He didn't look as if he <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up for some time.' ...|$|R
60|$|The Blue {{people were}} {{by this time}} dazed with wonder at all the events that had transpired that eventful day, but they still had wit enough to be glad the war was over, for in war someone <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hurt, and it is foolish to take such chances when one can remain quietly at home. The Blues did not {{especially}} admire the Pinkies, but {{it was easier to}} entertain them than to fight them, and above all, the Blueskins were greatly rejoiced that their wicked Boolooroo had been conquered and could no longer abuse them. So they were quite willing to obey the orders of their girl Queen and in a short time the blasts of trumpets and roll of drums and clashing of cymbals told Trot and Cap'n Bill that the Blue Bands had assembled before the palace.|$|E
60|$|My dear Haydon--I {{should have}} seen you ere this, but on account of my sister being in Town: so that when I have {{sometimes}} made ten paces towards you, Fanny has called me into the City; and the Christmas Holydays are your only time to see Sisters, that is if they are so situated as mine. I {{will be with you}} early next week--to-night it should be, but we have a sort of a Club every Saturday evening--to-morrow, but I have on that day an insuperable engagement. Cripps has been down to me, and appears sensible that a binding to you would be of the greatest advantage to him--if such a thing be done it cannot be before £150 or £200 are secured in subscriptions to him. I will write to Bailey about it, give a Copy of the Subscribers' names to every one I know who <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a £5 for him. I will leave a Copy at Taylor and Hessey's, Rodwell and Martin, and will ask Kingston and Co. to cash up.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should say}} {{certainly}} accept the offer, Jacques. You see, I {{can tell them}} all what a good friend you have been to me, and it maybe they will let you go free; {{but even if they}} don't I could make it pleasant for you with the men, and you may be sure that if they take you to an English prison I will do all I can {{to get you out of}} it. You see, when you get back to France you would have really a good sum coming to you from these three ships. The two that have been out here have collected a tremendous lot of valuable plunder, and the Bell Marie <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> quite as much if, as you say, she is going to spend two years out in the Indian seas. So I really think you would be wise to take the offer. Another thing, if you like I will not show myself at all, but will stop here with you, and we will take a boat together and make for some port, where we can give out that we are shipwrecked sailors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, I do {{not think}} Mr. George Rivers and I should <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on together. What a bad style of wit! You heard what Mary said about him? and Ethel {{repeated}} the doubt between hating and detesting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'll {{put you on}} at----," [...] {{mentioning}} terms which Weston fancied were as favorable as he <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get.</b> [...] "Still, you'll have to hustle, and we charge usual tariff for board. You {{may start}} in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All a mistake. When a man {{writes a}} scrawl himself, it's nat'ral he shoult read scrawls easiest, {{in his own}} case.

60|$|A dozen {{such men}} in power {{would be able}} to reform a kingdom. He hath no {{employment}} under the Crown; nor <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> or solicit for any: his education having not turned him that way. I will assure for no man's future conduct; but he who hath hitherto practised the rules of virtue with so much difficulty in so great and busy a station, deserves your thanks, and the best return you can make him; and you, my brethren, have no other to give him, than that of representing you in Parliament. Tell me not of your engagements and promises to another: your promises were sins of inconsideration, at best; and you are bound to repent and annul them. That gentleman, although with good reputation, is already engaged on the other side. He hath four hundred pounds a year under the Crown, which he is too wise to part with, by sacrificing so good an establishment to the empty names of virtue, and love of his country. I can assure you, the DRAPIER {{is in the interest of}} the present Lord Mayor, whatever you may be told to the contrary. I have lately heard him declare so in public company, and offer some of these very reasons in defence of his opinion; although he hath a regard and esteem for the other gentleman, but would not hazard the good of the city and the kingdom for a compliment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Feasible? Of course it's feasible," [...] said Madame {{with a shrug}} of contempt. [...] "Either the King is in want of the money, or he is not. Either Bonaparte <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it or he is not. If the King wants it, he {{must have}} it at any cost and any risk. Twenty-five {{millions}} in Bonaparte's hands at this juncture would help him to reconstitute his army and make it very unpleasant for the King and for us all. M. le préfet, {{who has been in}} charge of the money all along, and M. le Comte de Cambray, who is the only true royalist in the district, are both marked down by spies: ergo Mme. la Duchesse d'Agen is the only possible agent for the business, and an inoffensive old woman without any political standing is the least likely to be molested in her task. If I fail, I fail," [...] concluded Madame decisively, [...] "if I am stopped on the way and the money taken from me, well! I am stopped, that's all! and M. le préfet or M. le Comte de Cambray or any male agent they may have sent would have been stopped likewise. But I maintain that a woman travelling alone is far safer at this business and more likely to succeed than a man. So now, for God's sake, don't let's argue any more about it. Crystal is to be married on Tuesday and I could start that same afternoon. Can you bring the money over with you to-night?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{churches of}} Paris want the odour, the genial and ecclesiastical {{atmosphere}} and the devout superstition that rendered those of Italy so strikingly soothing and pleasant; {{but they are}} huge piles, and can always be visited with pleasure. Notre Dame de Paris is a noble monument, {{and now that the}} place of the archbishop is destroyed, one <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> better views of it, than is apt to be the case with these venerable edifices. A few evenings since M----, and myself ascended the towers, and seating ourselves on the leads, looked down, for near an hour, on the extraordinary picture beneath. The maze of roofs, out-topped, here and there, by black lacquered-looking towers, domes, pavilions of palaces, and, {{as is the case with}} the Tuileries and Louvre, literally by a mile of continuous structures; the fissures of streets, resembling gaping crevices in rocks; the river meandering through the centre of all, and spanned by bridges thronged by mites of men and pigmy carriages; the crowds of images of the past; the historical eminences that surround the valley of the capital; the knowledge of its interior; our acquaintance with the past and the present, together with conjectures for the future, contributed to render this a most impressive evening. The distant landscape was lost, and even quarters of the town itself were getting to be obscure before we descended, helping singularly to increase the effect produced by our speculations on those ages in which Paris had been the scene of so many momentous events.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{comprehensive}} {{research to}} document {{the number of children}} engaged in prostitution in the US is lacking, the Department of Justice, estimates about 293,000 American youth are currently [...] "at risk" [...] of becoming victims of commercial sexual exploitation. Sgt. Byron Fassett of the Dallas Police Child Exploitation Squad, points out an obvious irony of this situation. [...] "If a 45-year-old man had sex with a 14-year-old girl and no money changed hands, she <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> counseling and he <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> jail time for statutory rape.
