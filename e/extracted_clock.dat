40|$|Abstract—A {{performance}} analysis of an optical clock extraction circuit {{based on a}} Fabry–Perot filter (FPF) is presented. Two ana-lytical methods, time-domain and frequency-domain analysis, are developed in this paper. Time-domain analysis shows {{that there is no}} phase jitter in the <b>extracted</b> optical <b>clock</b> if the free spectral range (FSR) of the FPF is exactly equal to the signal clock fre-quency. Based on this, we obtain an analytical expression for root mean square (rms) amplitude jitter of the <b>extracted</b> optical <b>clock</b> in time domain, in which we have taken the impacts of carrier fre-quency drift and carrier phase noise into account. When the FSR of the FPF deviates from the signal clock frequency, both phase jitter and amplitude jitter will occur in the <b>extracted</b> optical <b>clock.</b> In this situation, a more general frequency-domain method is developed to deal with the timing performance under the assumption that car-rier phase noise is negligible. This method allows us to calculate both rms phase jitter and rms amplitude jitter of the <b>extracted</b> op-tical <b>clock.</b> Using the developed two methods, we present a detailed numerical investigation on the impacts of finesse of the FPF, car-rier frequency drift, resonator detuning, carrier phase noise, and optical pulse chirp on the timing performance. Finally, the applica-tion of this circuit in multiwavelength clock recovery is discussed.

40|$|Society {{has been}} witness to and {{participant}} in an on-going computing revolution as new classes of computing technology have displaced older technologies {{as the dominant}} market force [...] from mainframes decades ago to smartphones today. The rise of each new class of computing technology has brought about even smaller and more ubiquitous systems. As this trend continues, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are widely perceived as the new frontier of computing technology {{for a variety of}} applications, including environmental, infrastructure, and health monitoring. Many of these applications, however, require sensor nodes with both long lifetimes and small volumes, resulting in highly energy-constrained systems. Because energy sources, such as a battery and solar cell, have been slow to improve, energy must instead be conserved through better circuit design and systems analysis. While significant {{progress has been made in}} low-power processors and timers, wireless synchronization and communication remain the highest energy tasks in a wireless sensor node. In this dissertation, the design of three RF integrated circuits is presented to address challenges associated with synchronization and communication in WSNs.

Three kinds of SBS active filters are considered and their frequency-transfer functions are obtained under the assumption that pump depletion caused by SBS is negligible.

The analysis emphasizes the phase noise performance, {{taking into account the}} noise of the input data signal, the local voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), and the laser employed in the loop. The effects of loop time delay and the laser transfer function are included in the stochastic differential equations describing the system, and a detailed timing jitter analysis of this type of optoelectronic CR for high-speed optical-time-division-multiplexing systems is performed. It is shown that a large loop length results in a higher timing jitter of the recovered clock signal. The impact of the loop length on the clock signal jitter can be reduced by using a low-noise VCO and a low loop filter bandwidth. Using the model, the timing jitter of the recovered optical and electrical clock signal can be evaluated.
