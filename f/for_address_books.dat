40|$|We present DEC 0 DE, {{a system}} for {{recovering}} information from phones with unknown storage formats, a critical problem for forensic triage. Because phones have myr- iad custom hardware and software, we examine only the stored data. Via flexible descriptions of typical data struc- tures, and using a classic dynamic programming algo- rithm, {{we are able to}} identify call logs and address book entries in phones across varied models and manufactur- ers. We designed DEC 0 DE by examining the formats of one set of phone models, and we evaluate its performance on other models. Overall, we are able to obtain high performance for these unexamined models: an average recall of 97 % and precision of 80 % for call logs; and average recall of 93 % and precision of 52 % <b>for</b> <b>address</b> <b>books.</b> Moreover, at the expense of recall dropping to 14 %, we can increase precision of address book recovery to 94 % by culling results that donâ€™t match between call logs and address book entries on the same phone...|$|E

The same button used in standby toggled voice prompts, while pressing up/down controls ringtone volume. When the phone rung, due to incoming calls, the ringer could also be silenced by pressing up/down. All activated features (set alarm clock, activated vibration mode, roaming, ...) were indicated by simple icons in fixed positions in the top row, and every successful action acknowledged by an [...] "OK" [...] icon flashing on and off a few times.

40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} an easy-to-use {{set of tools}} which enables moderately to well experienced m-users to produce formatted output from flat data files. Usually {{all you need is}} AWK, m, and a sort program. A First Example Let us assume we have a text file containing addresses in more or less random order. Let us further assume that the main purpose of the file is to produce a printed address list and directory, possible in different versions sorted according to different criteria. Let us further assume that the data file has a very simple structure, namely a number of lines <b>for</b> each <b>address</b> and different addresses being separated by blank lines. Additionally, we assume that the items to be used in sorting occur on the same line in every address block, e. g. the surname is always on the first line, the city on the third line, and so on. Now we would like to format this material into a two-column format <b>for</b> an <b>address</b> <b>book</b> to be typeset by B m. For the first step, let us assume that the data already are sorted in the sequence we need for the printed version. Then the following little AWK program does the trick...|$|R
5000|$|<b>For</b> example, an <b>address</b> <b>book</b> {{application}} {{will generally}} need {{to store the}} contact name, an optional image, one or more phone numbers, one or more mailing addresses, and one or more email addresses. In a canonical relational database, tables would be created {{for each of these}} rows with predefined fields for each bit of data: the CONTACT table might include FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME and IMAGE columns, while the PHONE_NUMBER table might include COUNTRY_CODE, AREA_CODE, PHONE_NUMBER and TYPE (home, work, etc.). The PHONE_NUMBER table also contains a foreign key column, [...] "CONTACT_ID", which holds the unique ID number assigned to the contact when it was created. In order to recreate the original contact, the database engine uses the foreign keys to look for the related items across the group of tables and reconstruct the original data.|$|R

The contact information exchange occurs instantaneously and the userâ€™s phonebook updates automatically. Mobile social <b>address</b> <b>books</b> also provide dynamic updates of contacts if their numbers change over time.|$|R
