40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Winter 2015 <b>Infant</b> and toddler <b>high</b> <b>chairs</b> {{have saved}} many parents hassles {{involved}} with feeding time. These chairs, however, {{have a black}} mark on their record as <b>high</b> <b>chairs</b> are the 2 nd leading cause of injury by nursery products in children under 5. In 2012, an estimated 13, 200 {{children under the age}} of five were treated in hospital emergency rooms for injuries associated with <b>high</b> <b>chairs,</b> according to CPSC Nursery Product Reports. An analysis by Clinical Pediatrics reports that falling out of the chair accounted for almost 93 percent of the injuries, suggesting that perhaps a new design is needed. The goal of this project was to design a new style of chair for feeding in the hopes of developing solutions to previous failure modes or hazard patterns in High-Chairs that meets ASTM standards as well as consumer interest. Through research, the project focus was directed towards restraint system innovation...|$|R

Strickfaden recycled {{a number of}} the fancifully named machines he had created for the original Frankenstein for use in Bride, including the [...] "Cosmic Ray Diffuser", and the [...] "Nebularium". A lightning bolt generated by Strickfaden's equipment has become a stock scene, appearing in any number of films and television shows. The man behind the film's special photographic effects was John P. Fulton, head of the special effects department at Universal Studios at the time. Fulton and David S. Horsely created the homunculi over the course of two days by shooting the actors in full-size jars against black velvet and aligning them with the perspective of the on-set jars. The foreground film plate was rotoscoped and matted onto the rear plate. Diminutive actor Billy Barty is briefly visible from the back in the finished film as a homunculus <b>infant</b> in a <b>high</b> <b>chair,</b> but Whale cut the infant's reveal before the film's release.|$|R

[...] "I jest meandered into that shop over there, and I sez, 'I want ter {{see the man}} ez runs this yer mill o' literatoor an' progress.' Thar waz two <b>infants</b> sittin' on <b>high</b> <b>chairs</b> havin' some {{innocent}} little game o' pickin' pieces o' lead outer pill-boxes like, and as soon ez they seed me one of 'em crawled under his desk and the other scooted outer the back door. Bimeby the door opens again, and a fluffy coyote-lookin' feller comes in and allows that HE is responsible for that yer paper. When I saw the kind of animal he was, and that he hadn't any weppings, I jist laid the Left Bower down on the floor. Then I sez, 'You allowed in your paper that I oughter hev a little sevility knocked inter me, and I'm here to hev it done. You ken begin it now.' With that I reached for him, and we waltzed oncet or twicet around the room, and then I put him up on the mantelpiece and on them desks and little boxes, and took him down again, and kinder wiped the floor with him gin'rally, until the first thing I knowed he was outside the winder on the sidewalk. On'y blamed if I didn't forget to open the winder. Ef it hadn't been for that, it would hev been all quiet and peaceful-like, and nobody hev knowed it. But the sash being in the way, it sorter created a disturbance and unpleasantness OUTSIDE." ...|$|R

50|$|A <b>high</b> <b>chair</b> is a {{piece of}} {{furniture}} used for feeding older babies and younger toddlers. The seat is raised a fair distance from the ground, so that a person of adult height may spoon-feed the child comfortably from a standing position (hence the name). It often has a wide base to increase stability. There is a tray which is attached to the arms of the <b>high</b> <b>chair,</b> which allows the adult to place the food on it for either the child to pick up and eat or for the food to be spoon-fed to them. <b>High</b> <b>chairs</b> typically have seat belts to strap the child in.|$|R

6000|$|We entered, {{taking the}} {{forgotten}} kettle lid. The kitchen was large, but scantily furnished save, indeed, for children. The eldest, {{a girl of}} twelve or so, was standing toasting a piece of bacon with one hand, and holding back her nightdress in the other. As the toast hand got scorched, she transferred the bacon to the other, gave the hot fingers a lick to cool them, and then held back her nightdress again. Her auburn hair hung in heavy coils down her gown. A boy sat on the steel fender, catching the dropping fat {{on a piece of}} bread. [...] "One, two, three, four, five, six drops," [...] and he quickly bit off the tasty corner, and resumed the task with the other hand. When we entered he tried to draw his shirt over his knees, which caused the fat to fall wasted. A fat baby, evidently laid down from the breast, lay kicking on the squab, purple in the face, while another lad was pushing bread and butter into its mouth. The mother swept to the sofa, poked out the bread and butter, pushed her finger into the baby's throat, lifted the child up, punched its back, and was highly relieved when it began to yell. Then she administered a few sound spanks to the naked buttocks of the crammer. He began to howl, but stopped suddenly on seeing us laughing. On the sack-cloth which served as hearth rug sat a beautiful child washing the face of a wooden doll with tea, and wiping it on her nightgown. At the table, an <b>infant</b> in a <b>high</b> <b>chair</b> sat sucking a piece of bacon, till the grease ran down his swarthy arms, oozing through his fingers. An old lad stood in the big arm-chair, whose back was hung with a calf-skin, and was industriously pouring the dregs of the teacups into a basin of milk. The mother whisked away the milk, and made a rush for the urchin, the baby hanging over her arm the while.|$|R
