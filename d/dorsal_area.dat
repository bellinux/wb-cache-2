5|$|The {{great white}} shark has a robust, large, conical snout. The upper and lower lobes on the tail fin are {{approximately}} the same size {{which is similar to}} some mackerel sharks. A great white displays countershading, by having a white underside and a grey <b>dorsal</b> <b>area</b> (sometimes in a brown or blue shade) that gives an overall mottled appearance. The coloration makes it difficult for prey to spot the shark because it breaks up the shark's outline when seen from the side. From above, the darker shade blends with the sea and from below it exposes a minimal silhouette against the sunlight. Great white sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of serrated teeth behind the main ones, ready to replace any that break off. When the shark bites, it shakes its head side-to-side, helping the teeth saw off large chunks of flesh.|$|E
25|$|Female: Hindwing: {{the black}} on the costal margin as in cerberus, {{but there is}} always a large yellow spot at base of {{interspace}} 7; interspace 1 black, with a pale patch in the middle; the black terminal border broader, the inwardly extended cone-shaped markings prominent, those in interspaces 2 and 3 with pale buff lateral edgings, extended inwards to the postdiscal spots. In both male and female the hindwing on the upperside is clothed with soft, silky, long brownish-black hairs from base along the <b>dorsal</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
25|$|Upperside: ground colour {{similar but}} of a {{slightly}} paler shade in all the specimens I have seen. Forewing: costal and terminal margins edged more broadly with black than in thetis, the inner margin of this colour forms a regular strongly curved arch from base of wing to tornus, not angulate at all opposite apex of wing, the edging of the costal margin not jagged on the inner side. Hindwing: the costal margin not pale but somewhat broadly dusky black; the terminal black edging broader than in thetis, not linear, produced for a very short distance up each vein. The irroration of dusky scales at the bases of both forewings and hindwings and along the <b>dorsal</b> <b>area</b> of the hindwing heavier and more broadly diffused, especially on the latter. Underside: as in the typical form. Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen similar.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 5-5.7 mm. The forewings are whitish-grey, scattered with blackish-grey scales on the basal, costal apical and <b>dorsal</b> <b>areas.</b> The hindwings are pale grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 13-16 mm. The forewings are lustrous and orange, with about 27 to 53 white dots, some fused to form dashes especially on the distal and <b>dorsal</b> <b>areas,</b> the dots near the costa smaller. The hindwings are orange.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 10.5 mm. The forewings are creamy white with dark brown scales forming eight {{more or less}} distinct spots. Scattered dark brown scales exist over the wing, more densely at the costal and <b>dorsal</b> <b>areas.</b> The hindwings are fuscous, basally paler.|$|R
25|$|Helium was {{initially}} {{selected for the}} lifting gas {{because it was the}} safest to use in airships, as it is not flammable. One proposed measure to save helium was to make double-gas cells for 14 of the 16 gas cells; an inner hydrogen cell would be protected by an outer cell filled with helium, with vertical ducting to the <b>dorsal</b> <b>area</b> of the envelope to permit separate filling and venting of the inner hydrogen cells. At the time, however, helium was also relatively rare and extremely expensive as the gas was only available in industrial quantities from distillation plants at certain oil fields in the United States. Hydrogen, by comparison, could be cheaply produced by any industrialized nation and being lighter than helium also provided more lift. Because of its expense and rarity, American rigid airships using helium were forced to conserve the gas at all costs and this hampered their operation.|$|E
25|$|When larvae hatch {{from their}} eggs, {{they are either}} red or yellow. Their bodies have a slender and flat {{appearance}} with short legs due to their minimal movement. The larvae are covered in hair and have two horn-type projections on the <b>dorsal</b> <b>area</b> of the last body segment. Immediately after birth, they start searching for food close to where they hatched. They feed on wood-borer insects on trees, or feed on their species' substrate or prey of choice. Feeding is {{the main purpose of}} the larval stage to prepare for pupation. Once their larval stage is complete the tree dwelling species {{make their way to the}} bottom of the tree to pupate. The pupal stage can last from 6 weeks to one year depending on the need to overwinter, and how short the overall lifecycle is for a particular species. A majority of clerid species pupate in earthen cells which are made from soil and certain enzymes secreted from their mouths. The rest remain in pupal cells. Adult beetles emerge from pupation and spend a variable time of their life maturing, and eventually oviposit. Sexually mature adults or imagos of Thanasiumus sp. overwinter inside the wood-borer-infested trees and oviposit during the spring.|$|E
25|$|Once ashore, {{the pilot}} whale is killed by cutting the <b>dorsal</b> <b>area</b> {{through to the}} spinal cord with a special whaling knife, a mønustingari (spinal cord cutter), and after cutting it, the whaler must {{make sure that the}} whale is dead, he can do this by {{touching}} the whale's eye; before he cuts the neck open, so that as much blood as possible can run from the whale {{in order to get the}} best quality of meat. The neck is cut with a grindaknívur, but only after it has been killed. The mønustingari is a new invention which has been legal to use to kill pilot whales with since 2011, and since 1 May 2015 it is the only weapon allowed to slaughter a whale. The length of time it takes for a whale to die varies from a few seconds to a few minutes. Other observers complained that it took up to fifteen minutes for certain whales to die, they noted several cuts were sometimes made before a successful death and that some whales were not even killed properly until a vet finishes the job. With the new law which prohibits the whale hunters to stab the whales from the boats, this should not take place any more. According to the new Whaling Law (Grindalógin), it is only allowed to kill the whales from the shore, that means it is not the men who hunt the pilot whales with their boats who are slaughtering the whales, but men who are waiting on the beach with blowhole hooks with rope and spinal cord knives.|$|E
50|$|As {{mammalian}} cerebrums developed, {{volume of}} the dorsal cortex increased in slightly greater proportion, as compared proportionally with increased overall brain volume, until it enveloped the hippocampal regions. Recognized as neopallium or neocortex, enlarged <b>dorsal</b> <b>areas</b> envelop the paleopallial piriform cortex in humans and Old World monkeys.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 7.2 mm. The ground color of the forewings is brownish white. The costal and <b>dorsal</b> <b>areas</b> are faintly suffused with darker brown, leaving an ill-defined, whitish clouding longitudinally {{through the middle of}} the wing. The ground color of the hindwings is pale gray.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 22 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is brown {{with a slightly}} paler central area. There is a scattering of brown scales along the costal and <b>dorsal</b> <b>areas.</b> The fringe is unicolourous light brown-grey. The hindwings are light brown-grey. Adults have been recorded in May.|$|R
500|$|Once {{maturation}} is confirmed, one {{of three}} procedures is used to extract the eggs from a female paddlefish. [...] The three procedures are (1) the traditional hand-stripping method, considered to be time consuming and laborious; (2) Caesarean section, a relatively quick surgical method of extracting eggs through a [...] abdominal incision; considered faster than hand stripping, suturing can be time consuming and the incision may result in muscular stress and poor suture retention which lowers survival rate; and (3) MIST, (minimally invasive surgical technique) which is the fastest of the three procedures because it requires less handling of the fish and {{eliminates the need for}} suturing. [...] A small internal incision is made in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>area</b> of the oviduct, which allows direct stripping of eggs from the body cavity through the gonopore bypassing the oviductal funnels.|$|E
500|$|Caribbean {{monk seals}} had a {{relatively}} large, long, robust body, could grow to nearly [...] {{in length and}} weighed [...] Males were probably slightly larger than females, {{which is similar to}} Mediterranean monk seals. Like other monk seals this species had a distinctive head and face. The head was rounded with an extended broad muzzle. The face had relatively large wide-spaced eyes, upward opening nostrils, and fairly big whisker pads with long light-colored and smooth whiskers. When compared to the body, the animal's foreflippers were relatively short with little claws and the hindflippers were slender. Their coloration was brownish and/or grayish, with the underside lighter than the <b>dorsal</b> <b>area.</b> Adults were darker than the more paler and yellowish younger seals. Caribbean monk seals were also known to have algae growing on their pelage, giving them a slightly greenish appearance, which is similar to Hawaiian monk seals.|$|E
500|$|The first design, the Mark I, had a {{fuselage}} with {{a circular}} cross-section {{and a small}} round window in the nose for pilot vision. A [...] armored shell protected most of the fuselage. The pilot {{would have been in}} a prone position in the very cramped cockpit (the cross-section was , or approximately a quarter of the cross-section of the Messerschmitt Bf 109.) behind a removable [...] bullet-resistant glass screen mounted in front of the pilot. Two small bulges were located {{on the sides of the}} fuselage for the pilot's elbows. Three C-Stoff tanks surrounded the pilot, with the T-Stoff oxidizer tank in the center section between the pilot and the engine. The aircraft had straight wings, mounted at the top of the aircraft. In the <b>dorsal</b> <b>area</b> (at the wing mounts), the fuselage humped to accommodate a [...] blister for a single MK 108 [...] cannon and 60 (other writers say 45) rounds. The Walter HWK 109-509A single-chamber rocket engine was mounted beneath the aft fuselage, which also carried a twin-fin empennage and the drogue parachute housing.|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} anatomy, {{the body is}} divided into regions. In the front, the trunk is {{referred}} to as the [...] "thorax" [...] and [...] "abdomen". The back as a general area is the dorsum or <b>dorsal</b> <b>area,</b> and the lower back is the lumbus or lumbar region. The shoulder blades are the scapular area and the breastbone is the sternal region. The abdominal area is the region between the chest and the pelvis. The breast is also called the mammary region, the armpit as the axilla and axillary, and the navel as the umbilicus and umbilical. The pelvis is the lower torso, between the abdomen and the thighs. The groin, where the thigh joins the trunk, are the inguen and inguinal area.|$|E
2500|$|Spinner {{dolphins}} {{are small}} cetaceans with a slim build. Adults are typically 129–235cm long and reach a body mass of 23–79kg. This species has an elongated rostrum and a triangular or subtriangular dorsal fin. Spinner dolphins generally have tripartite color patterns. The <b>dorsal</b> <b>area</b> is dark gray, the sides light gray, and the underside pale gray or white. Also, a dark band {{runs from the}} eye to the flipper, bordered above by a thin, light line. However, the spinner dolphin has more geographic variation in form and coloration than other cetaceans. In the open waters of eastern Pacific, dolphins have relatively small skulls with short rostra. A dwarf form of spinner dolphin occurs around southeast Asia. [...] In these same subspecies, a dark dorsal cape dims their tripartite color patterns. Further offshore, subspecies {{tend to have a}} paler and less far-reaching cape. In certain subspecies, some males may have upright fins that slant forward. Some populations of spinner dolphin found in the eastern Pacific have bizarre backwards-facing dorsal fins, and males can have strange humps and upturned caudal flukes.|$|E

2500|$|Reindeer or (semi)domestic caribou Rangifer tarandus tarandus (qusngiq sg qusngik dual qusngit pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, qusngir sg qusngig dual qusngit pl in Cup'ig). The word qusngiq {{which is}} derived from the Chukchee qoraŋe (ӄораӈы) or Koryak qoyaŋa (ӄойаӈа). In Europe, use the terms [...] "caribou" [...] and [...] "reindeer" [...] synonymously, but in Alaska and Canada [...] "reindeer" [...] refers {{exclusively}} to semi-domesticated forms. Only in North America are wild Rangifer referred to as [...] "caribou". In Eurasia, [...] "reindeer" [...] are classified as either domesticated or wild. Domestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) were introduced into Alaska 100 years ago and have been maintained as semidomestic livestock. They have had contact with wild caribou (R. t. granti) herds, including deliberate crossbreeding and mixing in the wild. Reindeer have considerable potential as a domestic animal for meat or velvet antler production, and wild caribou are important to subsistence and sport hunters. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) managed reindeer operations on the Nunivak Island beginning in 1940. The Nunivak herd is composed of about 4,000 reindeer. The southern half of Nunivak is a designated Wilderness area, which presents challenges in summertime herding, since use of motorized recreational vehicles is forbidden within the Wilderness area without adequate snow cover. In the more recent past, when reindeer skins have been used for parkas, the front was usually taken from the ventral side of the deer, the back from the <b>dorsal</b> <b>area,</b> and leg strips were used for the sleeves. Hides are used for clothing, mukluks, blankets, mittens, tents, boat coverings, sleeping bags, house coverings and insulation. Back sinew is used to make thread. Hard antlers and bone are used to make utensils, tools and decorative objects.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of a specialised <b>dorsal</b> rim <b>area</b> with an ability to detect the e-vector orientation of polarised light is shown {{for the first time}} in a nocturnal hymenopteran. The <b>dorsal</b> rim <b>area</b> of the halictid bee Megalopta genalis features a number of characteristic anatomical specialisations including an increased rhabdom diameter and a lack of primary screening pigments. Optically, these specialisations result in wide spatial receptive fields (Delta rho = 14 degrees), a common adaptation found in the <b>dorsal</b> rim <b>areas</b> of insects used to filter out interfering effects (i. e. clouds) from the sky. In this specialised eye region all nine photoreceptors contribute their microvilli to the entire length of the ommatidia. These orthogonally directed microvilli are anatomically arranged in an almost linear, anterior-posterior orientation.

40|$|Glutamate {{stimulation}} of the <b>dorsal</b> facial <b>area,</b> an <b>area</b> located <b>dorsal</b> to the facial nucleus, increases common carotid arterial blood flow. Nitrergic neurons are important in cardiovascular regulatory areas. We investigated whether the nitrergic neurons might be present and {{play a role in}} the <b>dorsal</b> facial <b>area</b> to regulate the arterial blood flow. Injections Of L-arginine (an NO precursor) and sodium nitroprusside (an NO donor) into the area caused dose-dependent increases in the arterial blood flow. Injection of N G -nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, an NO synthase inhibitor) or methylene blue (a guanylate cyclase inhibitor) decreased the arterial blood flow. Nitrergic neurons and fibers were found in the <b>dorsal</b> facial <b>area</b> by histochemical staining of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) diaphorase, a maker of NO synthase. In conclusion, nitrergic neurons are present in the <b>dorsal</b> facial <b>area</b> and appear to release NO tonically in stimulating the area to cause increase in common carotid arterial blood flow.
