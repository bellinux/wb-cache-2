5|$|Federal judges, when {{interpreting}} the Constitution, frequently use The Federalist Papers as a contemporary {{account of the}} intentions of the framers and ratifiers. They have been applied on issues ranging from the power of the federal government in foreign affairs (in Hines v. Davidowitz) to the validity of <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto laws (in the 1798 decision Calder v. Bull, apparently the first decision to mention The Federalist). , The Federalist had been quoted 291 times in Supreme Court decisions.|$|E
5|$|Some {{practitioners}} of Falun Gong {{both inside and}} outside China are also involved in the promotion of the Tuidang movement, a dissident phenomenon catalyzed by an editorial series in The Epoch Times in late 2004. The movement encourages Chinese citizens to renounce their affiliations to the Chinese Communist Party, including <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto renunciations of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers. Practitioners of Falun Gong outside China make phone calls or faxes to mainland China to inform citizens of the movement and solicit renunciation statements.|$|E
5|$|Under Oregon law, Goldschmidt {{would have}} been {{required}} to register as a sex offender, had he been convicted {{of the crime of}} third degree rape. The fact that the registration law didn't pass until 1997, after the illicit sexual relationship ended, would not have exempted him from registration. Oregon case law has determined that the registration of offenders whose acts were committed prior to the passage of the law does not violate either Oregon’s Constitution or the United States Constitution’s prohibition on <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto laws.|$|E
5|$|It is {{acceptable}} to defend from a violent attack anywhere on the street especially {{when a person is}} attacked with a knife or another deadly weapon. Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes sometimes a subject of controversy. In general, each case is investigated in great detail before being eventually dismissed as a legitimate self-defense. The defense is judged according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender {{during the time of the}} imminent or ongoing attack, and not according to the view of persons who are judging it <b>ex</b> <b>post.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kirchner {{also changed}} the {{extradition}} policy, allowing extradition for people prosecuted abroad and not facing charges in Argentina. He also supported the requests by {{human rights organizations}} to turn the former detention centers into memorials for the disappeared. Argentina became a signatory of the UN Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity in 2003. A creative interpretation of the convention by the courts allowed them to circumvent the statutory limitations to crimes committed decades in the past, and also the <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto applicability of laws that were not in force {{at the time of}} the crimes.|$|E
5|$|Once the Alien and Sedition Acts were passed, the Federalists {{pushed for}} this letter to be {{printed in the}} Vermont Journal, which Spooner did, thus adding {{additional}} charges against Lyon. One other charge included publishing letters written by the poet Joel Barlow, which Lyon had read at political rallies. These also were published prior to the Acts. Lyon's defense {{was to be the}} unconstitutionality of the Acts, as Jeffersonians saw them as violating the First Amendment to the Constitution. In Lyon's particular case, there was the aforementioned letter to Alden Spooner {{as well as that of}} Barlow, which meant Lyon felt entitled to bring up the Constitution's safeguards against <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto laws. This defense was not allowed.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have also}} argued that {{inconsistent}} application of laws in different circuits is inherently unfair. Trevor W. Morrison, for example, claims that circuit splits create potential due process conflicts if criminal defendants are unaware that their behavior constitutes criminal activity in that circuit. An article in the New England Journal on Criminal & Civil Confinement also suggested that there {{is the potential for}} the unconstitutional <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto application of law after circuit splits are resolved. Additionally, Jesse M. Boodoo argues that federal agencies tasked with enforcing laws throughout the United States may face challenges implementing regulatory measures when federal legislation is interpreted differently in separate circuits.|$|E
5|$|Already the Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland has a {{great impact}} on the king's powers. From 1505 the king could not pass laws himself without the {{approval}} of the sejm, this being forbidden by Polish szlachta privilege laws like nihil novi. According to the nihil novi constitution, a law passed by the sejm had to be agreed by the three estates (stany sejmujące; the king, the senate and deputies from the sejm proper - the lower chamber). There were only few areas in which the king could pass legislation without consulting the sejm: on royal cities, peasants in royal lands, Jews, fiefs and on mining. The three estates of the sejm had the final decision in legislation on taxation, budget and treasury matters (including military funding), foreign policy (including hearing foreign envoys and sending diplomatic missions) and ennoblement. The sejm received fiscal reports from deputy treasurers, and debated on most important court cases (the sejm court), with the right of amnesty. The sejm could also legislate {{in the absence of the}} king, although such legislation would have to be accepted by the king <b>ex</b> <b>post.</b>|$|E
5|$|Article 20 {{provides}} {{protection from}} conviction for offences in certain respects, including the rights against <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto laws, double jeopardy {{and freedom from}} self-incrimination. Article 22 provides specific rights to arrested and detained persons, in particular the rights to be informed of the grounds of arrest, consult a lawyer of one's own choice, be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest, and the freedom not to be detained beyond that period without an order of the magistrate. The Constitution also authorizes the State to make laws providing for preventive detention, subject to certain other safeguards present in Article 22. The provisions pertaining to preventive detention were discussed with skepticism and misgivings by the Constituent Assembly, and were reluctantly approved after a few amendments in 1949. Article 22 provides that {{when a person is}} detained under any law of preventive detention, the State can detain such person without trial for only three months, and any detention for a longer period must be authorised by an Advisory Board. The person being detained also has the right to be informed about the grounds of detention, and be permitted to make a representation against it, at the earliest opportunity.|$|E
25|$|Prohibition of <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto laws: The Oireachtas may not enact <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto {{criminal}} laws (Article 15.5.1°).|$|E
25|$|The Fisher {{equation}} applies both ex ante and <b>ex</b> <b>post.</b> Ex ante, {{the rates}} are projected rates, whereas <b>ex</b> <b>post,</b> the rates are historical.|$|E
25|$|A bill of {{attainder}} {{is a law}} {{by which}} a person is immediately convicted without trial. An <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto law is a law which applies retroactively, punishing someone for an act that was only made criminal after it was done. The <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto clause {{does not apply to}} civil matters.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ex</b> <b>post</b> facto {{laws are}} {{dangerous}} to free government and banned (Section 11).|$|E
25|$|Concurrence: The {{statute is}} unconstitutional {{because it is}} an <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto law that retroactively imposes liability.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court {{found that}} the law {{constituted}} an unconstitutional <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto law, for it retroactively punished the offenses mentioned in the oath by preventing those who committed them from taking office.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court {{has used}} several {{tests of the}} decades to decide whether a law is an <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto one or not. De Veau v. Braisted is {{generally}} considered the first modern restatement of these tests, although others have since been used.|$|E
25|$|In Kring v. Missouri (1883), the Court {{also found}} that the statute {{violated}} the Constitution's prohibition against <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto laws (the plea was entered before the state constitutional amendment was passed). This alternative holding was overruled by Collins v. Youngblood (1990).|$|E
25|$|Forcing {{individuals}} {{to work for}} private companies without pay, under threat of having their social security payments stopped (Reilly, 2012, leading to {{the passing of the}} Jobseekers (Back to Work Schemes) Act 2013 as an <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto law, itself also criticised for violating human rights treaties).|$|E
25|$|The Tribunal itself {{strongly}} disputed {{that the}} London Charter was <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto law, pointing to existing international agreements signed by Germany that made aggressive war and certain wartime actions unlawful, {{such as the}} Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Covenant of the League of Nations, and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907.|$|E
25|$|Statutes passed {{after the}} Civil War {{with the intent}} and result of {{excluding}} persons who had aided the Confederacy from following certain callings, by the device of requiring them {{to take an oath}} that they had never given such aid, were held invalid as being bills of attainder, as well as <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto laws.|$|E
25|$|After USAC <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto {{declared}} Monserratt ineligible, the Third World Coalition {{sought to}} put forth a new candidate in his place. However, this was not permitted by the USAC. Thus, the election to replace Monserratt was between Mike Meehan and Mike Soules (who had already lost in the primary and endorsed Mike Meehan), with Meehan eventually winning.|$|E
25|$|The critic again {{found himself}} marginalized with the 1947–1948 {{establishment}} of the Romanian communist regime. As early as October 1947, he was stripped of his University of Iaşi position through an <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto decision adopted by Education Minister Ştefan Voitec (and which reputedly contradicted Romanian law). Cioculescu braved political persecution and communization, attending, with Strainu, the clandestine literary meetings organized by his fellow critic Pavel Chihaia.|$|E
25|$|In an originalist interpretation, if {{the meaning}} of the Constitution is static, then any <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto {{information}} (such as the opinions of the American people, American judges, or the judiciaries of any foreign country) is inherently valueless for interpretation of {{the meaning of}} the Constitution, and should not form any part of constitutional jurisprudence. The Constitution is thus fixed and has procedures defining how it can be changed.|$|E
25|$|Leaders {{and legal}} {{commentators}} {{in both countries}} criticised the prosecution as the application of <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto law and deemed the 5-year process to {{be a violation of}} Hicks's basic rights. The United States countered that the charges relating to Hicks were not retrospective but that the Military Commissions Act had codified offences that had been traditionally tried by military commissions and did not establish any new crimes.|$|E
25|$|Taft {{condemned}} the postwar Nuremberg Trials as victor's justice under <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto laws, {{in which the}} people who won the war were the prosecutors, the judges, and the alleged victims, {{all at the same}} time. Taft {{condemned the}} trials as a violation of the most basic principles of American justice and internationally accepted standards in favor of a politicized version of justice in which court proceedings became an excuse for vengeance against the defeated.|$|E
25|$|In the 13th century King Béla III {{declared}} the double cross (<b>ex</b> <b>post)</b> {{a symbol of}} Saint Ladislaus (King Ladislaus I of Hungary). In 1386, it {{became part of the}} coat of arms of the house of Jagiello, because Grand Duke of Lithuania Jogaila took over the alleged coat of arms of Saint Ladislaus when being baptized as Ladislaus (Wladyslaw). By means of the Jagiellons, the symbol also got into the coat of arms of Lithuania.|$|E
25|$|Ex parte Garland {{dealt with}} the {{disbarment}} from federal courts of Southern lawyers who refused {{to take an oath}} swearing they had not taken up arms or assisted the Confederacy. Carpenter argued that the act passed on January 24, 1865 was <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto (the war had since ended) and a bill of attainder (it punished without a trial). In December 1865 the court upheld his argument with the majority opinion employing phrases from Carpenter's brief.|$|E
25|$|Whether Reed excluded, by {{accident}} or by design, {{the names of}} men that accompanied him on such a vital mission, or whether members of the Light Horse sought credit, <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto, for a mission {{with which they were}} not involved, is unclear. History seems to have sided with the Light Horse; most accounts of the expedition mention twelve, not seven cavalrymen. A notable exception is David Hackett Fischer’s Washington's Crossing, which—perhaps nodding to the discrepancy—avoids the mention of a figure.|$|E
25|$|As an example, {{the name}} of a team, a genre, or a nation is a {{collective}} term applied <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto to a group of distinct individuals. None of the individuals on a sports team is the team itself, nor is any musical chord a genre, nor any person America. The name is an identity for a collection that is connected by consensus or reference, but not by sequence. A different name could equally follow, but it would have different social or political significance.|$|E
25|$|With the {{transition}} from English law, which had common law crimes, to the new legal system under the U.S. Constitution, which prohibited <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto laws at both {{the federal and state}} level, the question was raised whether there could be common law crimes in the United States. It was settled in the case of United States v. Hudson , which decided that federal courts had no jurisdiction to define new common law crimes, and that there must always be a (constitutional) statute defining the offense and the penalty for it.|$|E
25|$|Lord Belmore bought James Madison on 16 June 1813 {{and had her}} {{converted}} from schooner to brig rig. He also renamed her Osprey, with home port of Killybegs in Donegal. Later, Belmore had her armed; her warrant as a letter of marque against the United States named Richard Chambers as master {{and the size of}} her crew as 30 men. However, it bore the date 27 August 1814, which <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> was quite late in the war. There is no sign in either the London Gazette or Lloyd's List of Osprey taking any prizes.|$|E
25|$|According to the Moscow Armistice, {{signed by}} Finland and the victorious Allies, mainly the Soviet Union, the Finns were to try {{those who were}} {{responsible}} for the war and those who had committed war crimes. The Soviet Union allowed Finland to try its own war criminals, unlike other losing countries of the Second World War. The Finnish parliament had to create <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto laws for the trials, though in the case of war crimes the country had already signed the Hague IV Convention. In victorious Allied countries war-crime trials were exceptional, but Finland had to arrange full-scale investigations and trials, and report them for the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Hamdan {{continued}} to appeal his conviction after his release. It was upheld in 2011 by the Court of Military Commission Review and {{appealed to the}} United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On October 17, 2012 that Court vacated Hamdan's conviction, {{on the grounds that}} the acts he was charged with under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 were not war crimes by international law at the time he committed them. This meant that his prosecution was <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto and unconstitutional. Decided by a three-judge panel, the decision was written by Judge Brett Kavanaugh, with judges David Sentelle and Douglas Ginsburg largely concurring.|$|E
25|$|In psychiatry, pathography has {{developed}} a poor reputation, especially diagnostics that {{have been carried out}} <b>ex</b> <b>post,</b> without the direct examination of the patient. It is even considered unethical (see Goldwater rule). The German psychiatrist Hans Bürger-Prinz {{went so far as to}} state that any remote diagnostics constitute a “fatal abuse of psychiatry”. The immense range of mental disorders that Hitler has been credited with over time indicates how inconclusive this method can be (see table). Another example of the deficiencies present in many of the following Hitler-pathographies is an either completely absent or grossly abbreviated discussion of the abundance of publications which have already been submitted on this subject by other authors.|$|E
25|$|The {{new rules}} {{allowing}} document reclassification were outlined in Executive Order 12356. Previously, Executive Order 12065, issued by Jimmy Carter in 1978, had prohibited document reclassification. Executive Order 12356, issued by Ronald Reagan in 1982, eliminated the reclassification prohibition and described {{situations in which}} documents could be reclassified. Released documents could be reclassified {{as long as they}} could be reasonably recovered (meaning that documents available to the public at large would not meet this criterion). It also allowed documents requested under the FOIA or Privacy Act to be classified or reclassified provided they met specified requirements (e.g., certain matters related to national security). According to Bamford, he could not be prosecuted under the new rules because of the principle of <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto.|$|E
25|$|Protests by the People's Alliance for Democracy {{occurred}} in 2006, and on 19 September 2006 a military junta which later called itself the Council for National Security (CNS) replaced Thaksin's care-taker {{government in a}} coup while he was abroad. The Constitutional Tribunal dissolved the Thai Rak Thai party for electoral fraud <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> facto, banning him and TRT's executives from politics for five years. The CNS-appointed Assets Examination Committee froze Thaksin and his family's assets in Thailand, totalling 76billion baht ($2.2billion), claiming he had become unusually wealthy while in office. Thaksin {{and his wife had}} declared assets totalling 15.1billion baht when he took office in 2001, although he had transferred many of his assets to his children and associates before taking office.|$|E
