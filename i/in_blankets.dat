The former three fled while the latter hid herself <b>in</b> <b>blankets</b> to avoid detection, as she was sick and unable to flee. The surveyors ransacked the camp and Ishi's mother died soon after his return. His sister and uncle never returned.|$|E
25|$|The defense called two {{government}} {{witnesses who}} countered prosecution witness testimony about the duct tape. The chief {{investigator for the}} medical examiner stated that the original placement of the duct tape was unclear {{and it could have}} shifted positions as he collected the remains. Cindy Anthony testified that their family buried their pets <b>in</b> <b>blankets</b> and plastic bags, using duct tape to seal the opening. Additionally, an FBI forensic document examiner found no evidence of a sticker or sticker residue on the duct tape found near the child's remains.|$|E

25|$|Schenck ordered Lieutenant William H. Raynor {{to go back}} to {{the engine}} and have the {{engineer}} take the train out of range in the other direction. Schenck quickly followed Raynor. Raynor had to help loosen the brakes. Because the brakeman had uncoupled most of the cars, the engineer left them. He did not stop for the Union soldiers to catch up but continued all the way back to Alexandria. Schenck now had no means of communication and had to have the wounded men carried back to their camp <b>in</b> <b>blankets</b> by soldiers on foot. The regiment's medical supplies and instruments had been left on the train.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{structure is}} painted black to equalize temperature by radiative heat transfer. Overall, the spacecraft is thoroughly blanketed to retain heat. Unlike the Pioneers and Voyagers, the radio dish is also enclosed <b>in</b> <b>blankets</b> that {{extend to the}} body. The heat from the RTG adds warmth to the spacecraft while {{it is in the}} outer Solar System. While in the inner Solar System, the spacecraft must prevent overheating, hence electronic activity is limited, power is diverted to shunts with attached radiators, and louvers are opened to radiate excess heat. While the spacecraft is cruising inactively in the cold outer Solar System, the louvers are closed, and the shunt regulator reroutes power to electric heaters.|$|E
25|$|Grand jury {{proceedings}} (without {{defense counsel}} {{and without a}} judge present) in Santa Barbara, starting in March 2004, led to Jackson's indictment on April 21, 2004. The grand jury had nineteen jurors; the indictment required the votes of at least twelve jurors. Prosecution witnesses testified without defense cross-examination. The judge ruled that witnesses {{before the grand jury}} could talk to defense attorneys about their knowledge of the case as long as the witnesses did not tell what they saw in the grand jury room or what questions they were asked and their answers. Many grand jury witnesses were sneaked into the building where the grand jury was meeting, sometimes covered <b>in</b> <b>blankets</b> to hide their identities. In February 2005 The Smoking Gun published the Grand Jury transcripts (1903 pages).|$|E

25|$|As with Eady, Christie {{repeatedly}} raped {{his last}} three victims {{while they were}} unconscious and continued to do so as they died (copious quantities of semen were found inside these victims' bodies). When this aspect of his crimes was publicly revealed, Christie quickly gained {{a reputation for being}} a necrophiliac. One commentator, however, has cautioned against categorising Christie as such; according to the accounts Christie gave to the police, he did not engage sexually with any of his victims exclusively after death. After Christie had murdered each of his final victims by ligature strangulation, he placed a vest or other cloth-like material between their legs before wrapping their semi-naked bodies <b>in</b> <b>blankets</b> (in a similar manner {{to the way in which}} Beryl Evans's body had been wrapped), before stowing their bodies in a small alcove behind the back kitchen wall. He later covered the entrance to this alcove with wallpaper.|$|E
25|$|Velásquez began {{assisting}} {{his parents}} in the fields when he was four years old. His family traveled from the Southwest to Midwest each year, following the harvest season for various crops. They rode with other migrant workers in a pickup truck with a canvas-covered bed, huddling around a can of hot ashes and covering themselves <b>in</b> <b>blankets</b> to stay warm. Often, the family would have only a single room for the parents and all their children. One winter, he and his siblings had gathered together for warmth while snow drifted into their one-room shack through gaps in the walls. The family's poverty worsened one year when an employer paid his father only half the wages he was owed. In 1954, his parents settled permanently in Gilboa, Ohio, where they worked in the fields {{in the summer and}} in a cannery during the winter. Baldemar knew almost no English when he entered the first grade, and struggled academically. He was a good athlete, playing several sports, but was often ridiculed for his Mexican American heritage. Velásquez led his first strike at the age of 12, helping pickers at his summer job win better wages. He began to excel in his studies in the eighth grade, making honor roll. He attended Pandora-Gilboa High School, where he participated in baseball, basketball, football, and track and field, and took college preparatory courses. His high school career guidance counselor advised him to only focus on industrial arts courses, but Velásquez refused.|$|E
25|$|At 18:00 two RAAF UH-1B Iroquois piloted by Flight Lieutenants Cliff Dohle and Frank Riley arrived over D Company's {{location}} {{with the}} ammunition resupply, and guided by red smoke thrown by the infantry, they {{hovered in the}} heavy rain just above the rubber trees near a small clearing. Because {{they were to be}} dropped from some height, the wooden outer crates—which were still banded with metal straps—were wrapped <b>in</b> <b>blankets</b> for the wounded. Aboard the helicopters the 6 RAR Regimental Sergeant Major, Warrant Officer Class One George Chinn, and the officer commanding Administration Company, Major Owen O'Brien, pushed the crates out to the soldiers waiting below, many of whom were now very low on ammunition. The boxes landed in the centre of the position and the RAAF pilots were later praised for their skill and daring. Riley was later awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, while Dohle was mentioned in despatches (MiD). Yet, without tools to cut the straps, the infantry had to smash the crates open using machetes or the butts of their rifles to get to the inner metal boxes. Under heavy fire Warrant Officer Class Two Jack Kirby, the Company Sergeant Major, and Sergeant Neill Rankin, the 12 Platoon sergeant, began to distribute the ammunition. However, while the machine-gun rounds were pre-loaded in belts, the rifle rounds were still in bandoliers, complicating Kirby's job and forcing the soldiers to reload their own magazines as they struggled to keep the ammunition clean in the mud and rain. The resupply retrieved the situation for D Company. Prior to its arrival they had been down to their last 100 rounds, but with it complete the Australians resumed firing, forcing the Viet Cong back for a third time.|$|E

40|$|Soil pipes were {{surveyed}} <b>in</b> 160 British <b>blanket</b> peat catchments using consistent application of ground penetrating radar. Soil pipes {{were found in}} all catchments. The mean frequency of piping was 69 per kilometer of surveyed transect. Land management (moorland gripping) appears to exert the most important control on hillslope pipe frequency <b>in</b> <b>blanket</b> peats. Management practice in peatlands may therefore induce more rapid subsurface erosion, carbon loss and landform denudation via enhanced preferential flow. Topographic position is also important, with topslopes having greater pipe frequencies than footslopes, followed by midslopes with lowest frequencies. Slope gradient, however, is not a significant factor <b>in</b> controlling <b>blanket</b> peat pipe frequency. I propose that peat structural properties inherited from the way a blanket peat develops on a hillslope strongly control pipe network development. This is manifested in the way slope position appears to control pipe frequency. Aspect appears not to influence frequency <b>in</b> <b>blanket</b> peats except that it does play a weak role in catchments with annual precipitation less than 1500 mm. Here southwesterly-facing slopes {{tend to have more}} frequent piping...|$|R

500|$|On February 5, 1973, after {{a heated}} {{argument}} with his mother, Kemper left {{his house in}} search of possible victims. With heightened suspicion of a serial killer preying on hitchhikers in the Santa Cruz area, students were advised to only get into cars with University stickers on them. Kemper had such a sticker as his mother worked at UCSC. He encountered 23-year-old Rosalind Heather Thorpe and 20-year-old Alice Helen [...] "Allison" [...] Liu on the UCSC campus. According to Kemper, Thorpe entered his car first, which reassured Liu to also enter.

2500|$|Also {{during the}} American Civil War, Indian Mound Cemetery {{was used as}} a burial ground by both Union and Confederate armies.

Turner Ashby attended his brother's funeral at Indian Mound Cemetery where his behavior was described in Edward A.

2500|$|Believing he {{had killed}} Stottor, Nilsen seated the youth in his armchair, then noted his mongrel dog, Bleep, licking Stottor's face.

When Stottor regained consciousness, Nilsen embraced him; he then explained to Stottor he had almost strangled himself on the zip of the sleeping bag, {{and that he had}} resuscitated him. Over the following two days, Stottor repeatedly lapsed in and out of consciousness. When Stottor had regained enough strength to question Nilsen as to his recollections of being strangled and immersed in cold water, Nilsen explained he had become caught in the zip of the sleeping bag following a nightmare, and that he had placed him in cold water as [...] "you were in shock".

2500|$|The usual {{method of}} {{disposing}} of sand {{from all the}} digging was to scatter it discreetly on the surface. Small pouches made of towels or long underpants were attached inside the prisoners' trousers; as they walked around, the sand could be scattered. Sometimes, they would dump sand into the small gardens {{they were allowed to}} tend. As one prisoner turned the soil, another would release sand while they both appeared to be in conversation. The prisoners wore greatcoats to conceal the bulges from the sand, and were referred to as [...] "penguins" [...] because of their supposed resemblance. In sunny months, sand could be carried outside and scattered <b>in</b> <b>blankets</b> used for sun bathing; more than 200 were used to make an estimated 25,000 trips. The Germans were aware that something was going on, but failed to discover any of the tunnels until much later.

Of those, only six had actually been involved with tunnel construction.|$|E
2500|$|The 16th Division had a {{considerable}} number of gas casualties during the German attacks; the greatest number of deaths occurred, at the points on the British front where the gas was most concentrated. Anti-gas blankets fitted on dugout entrances were found to be ineffective but Lewis-guns wrapped <b>in</b> <b>blankets</b> and sprayed with Vermorel during the passage of the gas cloud, were only slightly affected. Some ammunition was made unusable and some rifles jammed, due to chemical deposits forming on the bolts. The troops most affected by the gas could not be relieved immediately but were exempted from carrying duties for the next day and no ill effects were reported. British troops were said to have been greatly encouraged by the German fiasco but uneasy about the protection offered by their PH gas helmets. The troops were deceived, by being told that the helmets issued to the 16th Division, had not been properly impregnated with chemical neutralisers and that 16th Division gas discipline had been unsatisfactory.

This information suggests that it may be appropriate to reconsider (I) the spatial sampling strategies employed to investigate subsurface flow <b>in</b> <b>blanket</b> peatlands, and (II) how field data are used to parameterize flow models. Critically, there was spatial structure in the heterogeneity, with a wedge of high-K peat directly above the pipe forming a hydrological conduit between near-surface peat and the perennially flowing pipe. There was also significantly greater horizontal K parallel to the pipe's orientation compared with horizontal K perpendicular to the pipe. Determinations of the triaxial anisotropy of K, undertaken {{for the first time in}} peat soils, revealed substantial directional variations in K. The K around the pipe-peat interface was investigated; however, sample length dependency of K for peat samples precluded the investigation of a hypothesized low-K skin around the pipe...|$|R
