25|$|Is {{the main}} {{amplifier}} block also a two-port? The main amplifier {{is shown in}} the upper shaded box. The ground connections are labeled. Figure 7 shows the interesting fact that the main amplifier does not satisfy the port conditions at its input and output unless the ground connections are chosen to make that happen. For example, on the <b>input</b> <b>side,</b> the current entering the main amplifier is IS. This current is divided three ways: to the feedback network, to the bias resistor RB and to the base resistance of the input transistor rπ. To satisfy the port condition for the main amplifier, all three components must be returned to the <b>input</b> <b>side</b> of the main amplifier, which means all the ground leads labeled G1 must be connected, as well as emitter lead GE1. Likewise, on the output side, all ground connections G2 must be connected and also ground connection GE2. Then, {{at the bottom of the}} schematic, underneath the feedback two-port and outside the amplifier blocks, G1 is connected to G2. That forces the ground currents to divide between the input and output sides as planned. Notice that this connection arrangement splits the emitter of the input transistor into a base-side and a collector-side – a physically impossible thing to do, but electrically the circuit sees all the ground connections as one node, so this fiction is permitted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} the undesirable charge transfer by the parasitic capacitances of the input transistors in a voltage sense amplifier. Due to its intrinsic rail-to-rail voltage transition, the <b>input</b> <b>sides</b> are inevitably disturbed. It can possible disturb the stabilities of the reference voltage levels. Moreover, it becomes serious in multi-channel systems by altering them for other channels, and so degrades the linearity of the systems. In order {{to alleviate the}} internal node voltage transition, the internal node stabilization technique is proposed by utilizing an additional biasing circuit. It achieves 47 % and 43 % improvements for node stabilization and input referred disturbance, respectively.

The working point of each diesel engine is determined in order to supply power to the propeller with maximum efficiency...|$|R

50|$|An {{opto-isolator}} connects <b>input</b> {{and output}} <b>sides</b> with {{a beam of}} light modulated by input current.
