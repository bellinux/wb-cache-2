40|$|This paper {{sets out}} {{a vision of}} how the {{consumer}} retail sector will develop in the short to medium term. It has been inspired through our work in the retail sector in general and remote shopping in particular. Over {{the past few years}} we have seen the <b>internet,</b> and the <b>hype</b> surrounding it, grow rapidly and we have been fascinated in watching the relatively mature retail sector of the early nineties thrown into turmoil and enter a new cycle of market development. Like many others we have wondered how it will continue and where it will all end. In particular, as anyone who has researched the topic will appreciate, the key to long term success in remote shopping lies not in the front end selling but in the order fulfillment process. It is this that has inspired the title for our paper and we will argue that it is overcoming this barrier (or not) which will drive the future shape of the retail sector as a whole.

40|$|Studies {{suggest that}} there has been an {{increase}} {{in the use of the}} Internet by patients in many Western societies. However, despite the many texts available on health and the Internet, not much is known about how much patients actually use the Internet to look up health information in their daily lives. We know little about what meaning this activity has for their experience of health and illness, and for their relationship with health-care practitioners. Objective: To explore patients' and practitioners' use of the Internet and to consider whether use of the Internet is changing relationships between patients and health-care practitioners. Method: The study used qualitative interviews and observations of patient–practitioner interaction. Our purposive sample of 47 patients (32 women and 15 men) had all had contact with the health services for information/treatment in relation to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) /menopause and Viagra/erectile dysfunction. The setting for the research was in general practitioners' surgeries, specialist clinics and patients' homes in the United Kingdom. Participants reflected a wide range of socio-economic groups, but most were white and British born, which, given the ethnic make-up of the town in which we conducted the research, was not surprising. In addition to patients, we interviewed 10 health-care practitioners (4 consultant doctors, 3 GPs, 2 specialist nurses, and a psychologist) about their own health information seeking practices (HISPs) and those of their patients. Results: Use of the Internet can increase patients' knowledge about their health conditions, although patients in our study were often too overwhelmed by the information available on the Internet to make an informed decision about their own care. Patients have a great deal of trust in their health-care practitioners. Health-care practitioners need to improve their own skills in <b>Internet</b> use. <b>Hype</b> around <b>Internet</b> use by patients appears to exceed the reality of Internet use. Conclusions: Our qualitative study suggests that use of the Internet is contributing to subtle changes in the relationship between health-care practitioners and their patients, rather than effecting the dramatic transformation some people envisage for it...|$|R

40|$|For a {{long time}} on-line reverse auctions have been {{proposed}} as an effective tool to improve the performance of corporate procurement. Five {{years after the end}} of the <b>Internet</b> and e-business <b>hype,</b> reverse auctions have become a standard procurement tool for large corporations. However, it has not been assessed as yet to what extent users actively apply the findings of auction theory to improve the design of reverse auctions. Based on a representative survey of companies using procurement auctions in Germany, the following paper reveals which auction designs are used in practice and to what extent more complex and sophisticated auction designs are adopted. By comparing the empirical results with the concepts of auction theory it is shown which levers can be pulled to improve the design of an auction. For auctions with many bidders, hybrid auctions seem to be promising as they can reasonably combine the benefits of different standard auction models. For auctions with only a few bidders, Dutch auctions might be superior to English auctions as they can create additional uncertainty and induce risk-averse bidders to bid more aggressively. In practice, however, it is very common that companies use different variations of the English auction such as rank or best/not best auctions rather than Dutch or hybrid auctions. Here it seems that framing effects rather than game-theoretic factors play an important role...|$|R
40|$|Internet {{has played}} {{a vital role in}} this modern world, the {{possibilities}} and opportunities offered are limitless. Despite all the <b>hype,</b> <b>Internet</b> services are liable to intrusion attack that could tamper the confidentiality and integrity of important information. An attack started with gathering the information of the attack target, this gathering of information activity can be done as either fast or slow attack. The defensive measure network administrator can take to overcome this liability is by introducing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) in their network. IDS have the capabilities to analyze the network traffic and recognize incoming and on-going intrusion. Unfortunately the combination of both modules in real time network traffic slowed down the detection process. In real time network, early detection of fast attack can prevent any further attack and reduce the unauthorized access on the targeted machine. The suitable set of feature selection and the correct threshold value, add an extra advantage for IDS to detect anomalies in the network. Therefore this paper discusses a new technique for selecting static threshold value from a minimum standard features in detecting fast attack from the victim perspective. In order to increase the confidence of the threshold value the result is verified using Statistical Process Control (SPC). The implementation of this approach shows that the threshold selected is suitable for identifying the fast attack in real time.

40|$|Abstract. In the Netherlands {{people with}} low income are {{entitled}} to receive legal aid. In almost every big city in the Netherlands centres for delivering this legal aid are present. Currently these centres are reformed into a Legal Services Counter (Het Juridisch Loket). This reform process has several aims, including improving accessibility, improving the quality and standardisation of legal aid throughout the country, and improving efficiency and consequently diminishing operational costs. To achieve this, the organisation will {{be turned into a}} service oriented one and new technologies, like call centre technology and Internet will be used. The Leibniz Center for Law has developed an Internet based knowledge system that should support both future employees of the legal services counters as well as their clients. In this paper we present our experiences in designing and implementing this system in a changing organisation and the impact of the organisational change on the design team. 1 Internet access to the law versus internet access to justice.

40|$|Traditional finance {{theories}} {{assume that}} investors only evaluate risk and expected returns when making investment decisions. More recent behavioral finance theories, however, argue {{that for many}} investors {{there is more to}} investing than only evaluating risk and returns. Examples hereof are investors who only invest in domestic companies or companies that operate in a social responsible way. This thesis examines the (personal) needs and behavior of individual investors in The Netherlands and confirms behavioral finance’s view. The respondents of our online investment survey indicate that besides financial needs, they also strive to satisfy more socially oriented needs through investing. These investors like to identify themselves with other investors and enjoy participating in investment-related conversations. Moreover, these investors consider investing to be a nice free time activity. This thesis also investigates the effects of striving to satisfy these different needs on the decision-making behavior of these investors. It is found that investors for whom socially oriented needs are important, also attribute more value to the opinion of others about their investment decisions and also request more information from these others before making their own decisions. Finally, using (multi-agent) computer simulations, this thesis investigates the effect of micro-level investor interactions on macro-level stock market dynamics. The trading and interaction rules of the simulated population of investors in this computer simulation are based on the empirical survey data. The simulation experiments showed that e. g., stock markets with a greater proportion of socially oriented investors display a greater volatility. In this respect, the research on which this thesis reports also contributes to identifying possible causes of recent stock market hypes and crashes, such as the late 1990 ’s <b>Internet</b> <b>hype.</b> ...|$|E

Making the complete land coverage of Earth in the shortest time could only be achieved by satellite imagery. However, the growing demand for more and ubiquitous details in urban and developing zones {{can be achieved by}} aerial images of very high resolution. These internet providers made the idea of geo-referenced images very popular and extended the traditional geospatial market by opening the access to this data for different applications and thus created the now well-known geospatial web portals.

Professional users, driven by the needs of their businesses and engineering applications, are in demand for highly accurate and up to date geospatial information.

Apart from widening their service offerings, advertising agencies are being driven to invest in building and sustaining valuable client relationships to establish client loyalty, with profit and a healthy bottom-line being the ultimate objectives. Bush, Bush and Harris (1998) point out however, that whilst a growing number of companies are interested in developing an online presence, significant confusion remains about what this new medium will offer stakeholders in the advertising industry. The study undertaken in this thesis explores the relationship between two influential stakeholders in the advertising industry - advertising agencies and their clients. To explore this relationship, the study modified Parasuraman, Zeithamal and Berry's (1988) SERVQUAL model to explore whether gaps exist between agency-client expectations of the value of the Internet as a promotional tool. The SERVQUAL model, which was designed for measuring gaps between service expectations and perceptions, was adapted for use in the business-to-business environment (B 2 B). In the marketing literature there is little evidence of B 2 B research in relation to agency-client relationships, nor has there been significant scholarly work exploring the effect of the introduction of the Internet as a promotional tool on the agency-client relationship. The research undertaken in this study aims to respond to this gap in the marketing literature by addressing the broad research question: "How will the introduction of the Internet as a promotional tool impact agency-client relationships?" Undertaking a review of agency-client expectations of the value of the Internet will ascertain whether gaps exist between agency and client expectations of the value of the Internet as a promotional tool. The discovery of gaps in the agency-client relationship in relation to Internet perceptions will indicate potential opportunities and challenges that need to be addressed by advertising agencies interested in extending their advertising services to embrace the Internet as a promotional tool. A major assumption in this inquiry was that gaps would exist between agency and client perceptions of Internet value. In particular, that advertising agencies would perceive the Internet to be a more valuable promotional tool than their clients. This assumption was informed from mass media and industry press, which indicated that advertising agencies were embracing new advertising creative in website design and strategic marketing activities using interactive media such as newsgroups and email to reach customers. However, the research of Bush et al. (1998) and Ducoffe (1996) suggests that little is known about the value of these Internet-based activities. Such thinking raises questions, such as: are advertisers feeling compelled to jump on the Internet bandwagon because of its popularity, or are businesses' desires to use Internet advertising a manifestation of <b>Internet</b> <b>hype?</b> To begin to answer these questions advertising industry stakeholders need to identify whether gaps do exist between agency and client perceptions of the value of the Internet as a promotional tool. The existence of such gaps could lead to tension in the agency-client relationship, which may ultimately mean a loss of client accounts for the advertising agency. Identifying and remedying such gaps could therefore aid in ensuring long-term and profitable working relationships with the agency's clients. To undertake this advertising industry research and respond to the research questions in this study an international advertising agency network, made up of 206 offices in 90 countries and a selection of their clients, were recruited to participate in the study. A two stage survey method approach was adopted because it was a time-efficient and affordable method for collecting detailed information from a dispersed network of professionals. The survey tool was a web-based questionnaire which was firstly submitted to a selection of advertising agencies within the international agency network. On completion of the questionnaire, agencies were asked to provide contact details for their top three billing clients. The second stage of the survey research involved the submission of a client questionnaire to the client contacts provided by the advertising agency. Both questionnaires used a modified SERVQUAL multi-item scale to measure service expectations. Discrete agency and client questions were also included in the respective questionnaires to situate the SERVQUAL analysis within the context of Internet usage, value perceptions and organisational characteristics (e. g. agency size, advertising spend, experience in using interactive media). The major finding of this study is that within the international advertising agency network there were no significant gaps in agency-client expectations concerning the value of the Internet as a promotional tool. Whilst several statistical analyses were undertaken, including bivariate and multivariate techniques such as Pearson's Chi-Square cross-tabulations, independent t-tests and ANOVAs, no statistically significant results are reported. In fact, it was found that advertising agencies and clients have similar expectations of the value of the Internet as a promotional tool. Gaps actually exist in relation to the clients who use the Internet as a promotional tool and agencies who supply Internet advertising services. Many agencies within this international agency network were found to be actively using the Internet, but their Internet advertising functions were not being provided by their traditional advertising agency. Descriptive analyses reported in the findings from this research study indicate that advertising agencies in this international network need to better understand their clients' Internet promotion needs. This will ensure the establishment of healthy, profitable and long-term agency-client relationships in the future. The research findings from this study offer advertising agencies worldwide insight into client expectations of the Internet, as well as other agency services. Furthermore, the findings reported contribute to the current small body of research in relation to B 2 B relationships in the advertising industry. The groundwork is set for future analysis of agency-client relationships in the advertising industry. In summary, while gaps between agency and client expectations of the value of the Internet as a promotional tool were expected, this research study found that agency and client expectations are quite similar. Analysis did reveal that one important factor, which influences the agency-client relationship, relates to the provision of Internet advertising services. Specifically, when an agency is not responsible for developing and maintaining clients' Internet advertising, these clients are utilising services from external providers of Internet services. These new stakeholders, who provide specialist services (i. e. graphic design houses, Internet advertising specialists and client's in-house Internet services), are changing the competitive environment of advertising services in the industry. Another interesting discovery, specific to the sample population, was that one third of agencies within the study did not provide Internet advertising services to current clients. However, these agencies have clients that use Internet advertising. On the one hand, this finding indicates that opportunities exist for these agencies to extend their service portfolio to embrace Internet advertising. However, it also raises an important question: that is, have these agencies created greater competition by not providing a full service communication portfolio for clients? These factors, and other methodological issues will inform directions for future research to explain the influential role of the Internet within the agency-client relationship in the advertising industry...|$|E
