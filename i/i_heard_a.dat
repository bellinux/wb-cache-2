I can't {{remember the last time}} <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> ballad of this type so completely fleshed-out and fully realized". Ryan B. Patrick of Exclaim! noted that songs on the album, such as Rocket", effectively display genre diversity, Beyoncé's vocal range and [...] "a penchant of musical experimentation". Although describing it as a [...] "pitch-perfect rehash" [...] of [...] "Untitled" [...] and noting that it succeeded in turning Beyoncé's [...] "sex life into topography", Fact Chris Kelly felt [...] "Rocket" [...] was unnecessary on the album. Philip Cosores of Paste stated that the song was [...] "dragging on a minute or two too long". Janice Llamoca from the website HipHopDX called it suitable for a bonus track on Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience (2013). Neil McCormick, writing for The Daily Telegraph criticized the song as a [...] cut meant for The 20/20 Experience.

Like {{a minute and a half}} through <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> line and was like, 'I know where she's at!'". The band, however, liked the cover enough to send Slayer T-shirts to her. The song was also covered by Malevolent Creation, Chimaira, Vader, Dokaka, Reggie and the Full Effect and Killick Erik Hinds, who covered the entire album on a H'arpeggione. [...] "Raining Blood" [...] was also covered by the New Zealand drum and bass band Concord Dawn on their 2003 album Uprising, and by Nashville, Tennessee band Asschapel on their 7" [...] "Satanation".

500|$|Pfeiffer {{provides}} {{all of her}} character's vocals {{for both}} the film and its soundtrack. Because she does not consider herself a professional singer, Pfeiffer's inhibitions about singing on camera initially contributed to her early reservations about accepting the role, having not done so since her performance in Grease 2; The Fabulous Baker Boys would mark Pfeiffer's first professional singing role in seven years. Despite Kloves' insistence that Pfeiffer's singing voice not be dubbed, composer Dave Grusin was initially skeptical about Pfeiffer's musical abilities until she ultimately convinced him with her rendition of [...] "My Funny Valentine". For four months (although sources differ, citing any period of time between two months to an entire year), the actress took extensive singing lessons {{under the tutelage of}} voice coach Sally Stevens in preparation for the role, at the suggestion of Grusin. In addition to performing vocal exercises to strengthen her vocal chords, Pfeiffer would often work 10-hour days in the recording studio before finally returning home to listen to and study her own recordings. Already impressed with Pfeiffer's rhythm and phrasing, Stevens trained the actress to avoid pronouncing words in ways that would make the film's jazz standards sound too much like rock songs; Stevens jokenly linkened Pfeiffer's original pronunciation to musician Bob Dylan, and recording the songs for Pfieffer to use as reference for enunciation, teaching the actress about using her teeth and mouth to pronounce words and smiling to [...] "lift" [...] her pitch. Admitting that the film's songs were much more difficult than the ones she had performed in Grease 2, Pfeiffer worked especially hard on improving her phrasing because the material for The Fabulous Baker Boys were different than the pop music she had grown more accustomed to singing, explaining, [...] "Those older songs were written for singers; they weren't written for synthesizers and drums... It was an entirely new way of listening to songs." [...] Additionally, the actress drew inspiration from real-life lounge singers performing at The Hollyood Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles, while listening to jazz singers Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Rickie Lee Jones, Billie Holiday and Helen Merrill for inspiration, maintaining, [...] "I didn't copy anybody, but <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> lot. For me, it helps to act the song out." [...] Pfeiffer incorporated the [...] "undercurrent of anger" [...] in the lounge singer's performances, drawn from the fact that [...] "a lot of club singers... haven't had the recognition they feel they deserve or that they had hoped for" [...] into her own interpretation of Susie. Stevens encouraged Pfeiffer to envision herself as Ingrid Bergman's character Ilsa Lund in the film Casablanca (1942) while recording [...] "More Than You Know" [...] for the film's soundtrack, which the actress identified as one of her favorite songs. Stevens also suggested that Pfeiffer research jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald because Fitzgerald possesses [...] "a quality artists of that period had that we felt the character Susie might have listened to", describing the end result as [...] "an airy alto, a nice breathy quality, and intelligence in delivery". Despite her extensive training, the vocal coach felt it was important that Susie's voice sound [...] "pleasant" [...] but still untrained. Kloves maintains that he did not hire Pfeiffer based on her singing abilities, but rather because {{of the way in which}} she uses her acting abilities to interpret lyrics.|$|E
