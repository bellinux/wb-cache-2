5|$|Framed by Judah Wright in 1752 for Joseph Webb, the three-and-a-half story {{house was}} {{designed}} {{with a large}} <b>gambrel</b> <b>roof</b> that provides extra storage space. Webb was a successful merchant who had ships trading in the West Indies and ran a local store; he married Mehitabel Nott and had six children before his death {{at the age of}} 34. The executor of the estate was Silas Deane who assisted Mrs. Webb financially and emotionally. Deane later married Mrs. Webb and built a house next door. The eldest child, Joseph Webb Jr., then 12 {{at the time of his}} father's death, inherited the house.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who built}} new homes used the vernacular {{traditions of the}} New England ports they had come from, {{building}} center-chimney frame houses such as 116 Union Street. They generally eschewed the Dutch traditions of the Hudson Valley. The <b>gambrel</b> <b>roof</b> on 126 Union Street is not inspired by the many ones on Dutch buildings in the area but by older New England models.|$|E
25|$|A {{driveway}} {{from the}} intersection provides parking {{between the house}} and a former barn to the south, now used as a garage. The house itself is a one-and-a-half-story, five-by-three-bay wood frame structure on a fieldstone foundation. It is sided in clapboard on all but the north (rear) elevation and topped with a <b>gambrel</b> <b>roof</b> shingled in wood. Brick chimneys pierce it at either end.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{built in}} the Georgian-influenced American Colonial style, it later {{acquired}} some Federal style decoration, particularly on the interior. The lunette windows on the second story may have been added later, after their use on a now-demolished local hotel. Despite later modifications, {{it is the only}} house from that era remaining in the town that has a <b>gambrel</b> <b>roof.</b> It remains a private residence.|$|E
25|$|Its design {{reflects}} the architectural influences that prevailed {{from the middle}} of the century through American independence. Migrants from New England had begun settling in the Hudson Valley, bringing with them a preferred vernacular building form of a rectangular one-and-a-half-story house of local material with <b>gambrel</b> <b>roof.</b> Inside the prevalent Georgian influences were more marked: a center-hall, four-over-four floor plan and balanced facade. Many houses like the Williams house, which may originally also have included a rear porch, were built through the 1820s.|$|E
25|$|Nathaniel Gilman House {{was built}} in 1740. The Gilman House is a large colonial white {{clapboard}} home with a <b>gambrel</b> <b>roof</b> hipped at one end, a leaded fanlight over {{the front door and}} a wide panelled entry hall. This home, as well as the Benjamin Clark Gilman House which is also owned by the Academy, were built for members of Exeter's Gilman family, who donated the Nathaniel Gilman House to the academy in 1905. The home now houses the academy's Alumni and Alumnae Affairs and Development Office.|$|E
50|$|Common {{characteristics}} of Dutch colonial architecture are they typically, {{but not always}} had <b>Gambrel</b> <b>roofs</b> with flared eaves, Dutch doors and brick chimneys built at the gable ends.|$|R
50|$|It {{is a large}} <b>gambrel</b> <b>roofed</b> barn. It is 54x84 ft in {{plan and}} 30 ft tall, built on a slope. Its main gambrel portion was built in 1910, with {{additions}} in 1916.|$|R
50|$|The {{buildings}} most {{representative of}} Professorville are brown-shingled houses with <b>gambrel</b> <b>roofs,</b> whose stylistic influences range from Colonial Revival to American Craftsman. Dutch Colonials are the predominant architecture on three blocks of Kingsley Avenue.|$|R
25|$|The {{building}} has a skillion roof clad with later metal sheeting, supported by early steel girders (both uprights and trusses) and {{is lined with}} sheets of ripple iron. The original <b>gambrel</b> <b>roof</b> has been removed and the present roof follows {{the slope of the}} former upper seating tier, which has been removed. Along the ringside front of the roof are six mock dormers and a central pediment with the lettering: RNA EXHIBITION GROUNDS. Beneath this, at fascia level, is the lettering: ERNEST BAYNES STAND. Timber batten valances along the front and side of the roof are not original.|$|E
25|$|The house {{represents}} {{a mix of}} styles, waxing and waning, in a fashion popular during {{the last years of}} the 19th century. The irregular, yet compact, massing of the main forms and mixture of materials are characteristic of the Queen Anne style, then reaching its final stages. In contrast, the <b>gambrel</b> <b>roof</b> and Palladian window show the emergence of the Colonial Revival, a style that would become widespread in {{the first decades of the}} new century. Its overall generic style demonstrates architectural trends moving out of their original contexts and the integration of Chelsea with the larger economy.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} {{prominent}} families to live there was the Harris family. The circa 1906 home of Isaac Harris still stands at 444 Bloomingdale Road. He {{was the son of}} Silas Harris, one of two brothers who settled in Sandy Ground with their families early in its history. The Isaac Harris house was designed by architect Stanford White of the firm of McKim, Meade and White, who drew up the plans as a gift after Harris' years of service on his household staff. The house boasts a <b>gambrel</b> <b>roof</b> and front bay. Harris' home is one of only about 12 of the original old homes still standing in the community.|$|E

50|$|A {{significant}} difference between the two, for snow loading and water drainage, is that, when seen from above, <b>Gambrel</b> <b>roofs</b> culminate in a long, sharp point at the main roof beam, whereas mansard roofs always form a low-pitched roof.|$|R
50|$|Mallory Mill is a {{historic}} grist mill located at Hammondsport in Steuben County, New York. It was built about 1836 and is four story, <b>gambrel</b> <b>roofed</b> stone industrial building. In the 1880s, it was converted {{for use as a}} winery.|$|R
25|$|This is the {{earliest}} {{of the surviving}} ringside stands, located on the northwest side of the Main Arena. It is a substantial brick structure with a <b>gambrel</b> <b>roof.</b> In {{the centre of the}} roof is a large fleche with cupola and four-faced clock which can be seen from much of the showgrounds. The roof of the stand, which has been re-clad with a recent corrugated metal sheeting, is supported on early light steel trusses and round cast metal columns with cast-iron brackets and valances along the front and sides. Between the arc of the central bay is a large sign with the lettering: JOHN MACDONALD STAND. The sides and front of the stand have a decorative cast-iron balustrading.|$|E
25|$|The book, purportedly {{based on}} a true story, {{describes}} the house at 112 Ocean Avenue as remaining empty for 13 months after the DeFeo murders. In December 1975, George and Kathleen Lutz bought the house for what was considered to be a bargain price of $80,000. The five-bedroom house was built in Dutch Colonial style and had a distinctive <b>gambrel</b> <b>roof.</b> It also had a swimming pool and a boathouse, as it was located on a canal. George and Kathy married in July 1975 and each had their own homes, but they wanted to start fresh with a new property. Kathy had three children from a previous marriage: Daniel, 9, Christopher, 7, and Melissa (Missy), 5. They also owned a crossbreed Malamute/Labrador dog named Harry. During their first inspection of the house, the real estate broker told them about the DeFeo murders and asked if this would affect their decision. After discussing the matter, they decided {{that it was not a}} problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildings}} {{on the south side}} of Castle Square are all of a similar age but show a great variety of sizes and styles. The Royal Pavilion Tavern is one of the taller buildings at four storeys in height. The slate-tiled <b>gambrel</b> <b>roof</b> has dormer windows and is partly hidden behind a balustrade which sits on top of a parapet and cornice. The fa√ßade is stuccoed and projects as a segmental-arched bow front. The stucco is rusticated at ground-floor level. The entrance is in the rightmost of the three bays and is flanked by granite pilasters topped by brackets with foliage decoration. Above this, an iron balcony runs across the full width of the building at first-floor level; this dates from the late 19th century and has finials in the form of interlinked dolphins and crowns, recalling the Borough of Brighton's emblem. Each storey has three windows, but they are treated in various ways; those at first-floor level have architraves, the second-storey windows have a small individual iron balcony with anthemion decoration; and those on the top floor have prominent sills.|$|E

25|$|Roofs were {{typically}} covered with wood shingles until sheet metal roofing became available. Thatch roofing {{had fallen out}} of use by this time period. The wall sheathing was usually vertically boarded but may be studded with the wall boards installed horizontally. Barns may be left unpainted or painted, most commonly an inexpensive red color. Ventilation was desired in barns so the walls were sometimes left without siding or covered with wood shingles or clapboards and then asphalt shingles. The New England barn may have been ornamented in an architectural style to match the farmhouse. Ventilators and cupolas were added to some barns in the 19th century to improve ventilation. Lightning protection systems were often strung along the roof ridge in intercept lightning strikes and prevent fire. New England barns are usually a type of bank barn, built into the side of a hill giving ground level access to one side, but a ramp or rarely a bridge were used to access the doors. The roof form is typically a gable roof but some New England barns were built with a <b>gambrel</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
500|$|Facing {{southeast}} on the Norwichtown green, the Joseph Carpenter Silversmith Shop is a [...] by [...] -story clapboarded {{building with}} a <b>gambrel</b> <b>roof.</b> Constructed between 1772 and 1774, the building was built on a stone foundation and has a stone stoop leading to the front entrance. The <b>gambrel</b> <b>roof</b> is framed without a ridge pole. It overhangs {{the front and back}} facades by , but does not project the sides. At the time of the National Historic Register of Places nomination, the roof used wooden shingles. The interior has a single brick chimney that was used for the forge. The main floor was originally open, with only a single supporting post in the center, but this was later partitioned into several rooms. Modern additions to the shop include modern doors, electric lighting and heat, and a disappearing overhead stairway that leads to the attic. The shop's cellar was not described in the survey. In 1915, the house passed out of the Carpenter family, and it was restored by Norman Isham in 1916. In 1956, the building came into the ownership of the [...] "Society of the Founders of Norwich, Connecticut, Inc.". According to the 1966 edition of Fodor's Modern Guides, the Joseph Carpenter Silversmith Shop was [...] "still furnished as it was when Mr. Carpenter plied his trade." [...] The National Historic Register of Places noted that the partitioning was [...] "recent" [...] {{at the time of its}} 1970 nomination. In 1997, a $5000 grant was used to replace the roof.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} {{currently has}} two dormers {{on opposite sides}} of the roof, but neither seems to be part of the original structure. Older photos as late as 1918 show the roof without any windows implying they were added at some later date. [...] Being the building's most prominent design feature, the <b>Gambrel</b> <b>roof</b> would later influence Louis Warren Ross, architect and an alumnus of the college, in his design of the Butterfield dormitory which, for a time, was the only other building on the hill. Since the Apiary and Butterfield Hall are the only two buildings on campus to exhibit this architectural motif, it seems likely that this was incorporated in the latter's design to compliment the former.|$|E
